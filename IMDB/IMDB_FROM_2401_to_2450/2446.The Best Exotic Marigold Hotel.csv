0,MartinHafer,Very enjoyable but not for everyone.,8,23 October 2012,"There really is no movie that everyone likes, so my summary isn't exactly surprising. However, more than most movies, this one will probably have polarized views from audiences. If you appreciate films with characters studies, then you should love ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"". If you prefer action or something very much like the typical Hollywood fare, then this film is definitely NOT for you! This movie is about a group of elderly Brits were are brought together by a common thread--they have great difficulty affording their twilight years and see an ad for the Marigold Hotel in India. They each realize that retirement or surgery would be MUCH cheaper there so they arrive in a completely foreign land--with traditions, culture and rules which are practically nothing like home. Some adapt very well to their new land, some definitely do not--but it's all an adventure and voyage of discovery where each learns more about themselves--as does the audience. Sometimes, the results are a bit formulaic and predictable but very often they are not--and that makes the film very likable. I also like that the older folks in the film are NOT the usual 'cute' oldsters you see in films--they have sexual urges, difficulties, flaws and hidden longings. Exceptionally well acted and directed and a joy for this reviewer.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
1,TheLittleSongbird,Terrific fun,9,19 March 2013,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of those films where the cast is reason enough to see it, and here it really is a great cast that promises so much. And I didn't find it disappointing in the least. Maybe it isn't quite perfect, the ending is a little too predictable and convenient and Dev Patel's performance while sometimes appealing was a mixture of robotic and trying too hard. But the good far outweighs the bad- for me the bad things weren't that bad and very few- and the result was a truly delightful film where you know that if it puts a smile on your face that it's done its job right. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is gorgeous to watch, the photography is never irritating and dull and only compliments the strikingly colourful Indian scenery. The music has plenty of authentic flavours and is of great interest to anybody keen to broaden their musical horizons. The story is the kind we've seen before and doesn't have depth, but it didn't need to be nor did it try to. It does however manage to be colourful and fresh throughout, with real and everyday themes like racism and snobbery well-explored without insult or distaste and the love stories touching. The script positively sparkles, it is genuinely funny- Bill Nighy and Ronald Pickup's one-liners are a hoot- and affecting. The acting is wonderful(with only Patel I had reservations about), helped by John Madden's adept direction and interesting characters that suit the actors down to a tee. Judi Dench and Bill Nighy are the standouts, but Maggie Smith, Celia Imrie, Tom Wilkinson and Ronald Pickup are wholly memorable also. Throughout there is evidence of personal charm, great comic timing, nuances and great chemistry as you'd expect from such an experienced cast. To conclude, I found The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to be terrific fun, it was charming and funny with great writing and a wonderful cast. 9/10 Bethany Cox",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
2,SnoopyStyle,great Brit cast,7,29 June 2016,"Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) recently lost her husband and wants to do something new. Judge Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) abruptly quits to return to India. Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) and Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) can't afford a good retirement having lost their money. Racist Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) needs a new hip. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is lascivious. Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) leaves her daughter's family to find a husband. They all travel to Jaipur, India for their various reasons and stay at a run-down hotel run by Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel).It's a lot of old British folks trying to grow in a foreign environment. It's not anything outstanding but it does have great actors. They make this good by their will and performances. It has a light exoticism. It's not terribly dramatic. Each story has just enough revelation to keep it interesting. Dashwood is probably the most compelling. Without these mastercraftsmen, this wouldn't work.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
3,Hitchcoc,"Nice, Predictable, Lightweight Movie",7,20 March 2015,"Throw together a group of outstanding British actors and actresses, give each of them a story, put them in a hotel in India, and you've got a nice ensemble film. There are many stories at work. The principle one is that of a young man who is trying to get an old hotel, previously owned by his father, running efficiently. When the Brits show up, a whole dynamic starts to develop. One man is there to try to hunt down his gay friend who he knew as a child. Another is a woman whose husband died, leaving her so much debt that she had to sell their apartment. A third couple obviously has little in common. She is filled with anger and she with adventure. This is just a brief view of things. It all has to do with how they manage to begin lives in a totally foreign setting, drawing on their life experiences. Maggie Smith is wonderful once again, as a woman who had incredible management skills but was let loose by her employer.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
4,Prismark10,The Best Exotic Marigold Hote,7,1 January 2021,"A film about a bunch of British retirees to India might not sound too grand. With the cream of British acting involved and some well crafted direction, this hotel earns its star ratings.Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) is newly widowed and has to sell her house to pay her husband's debts.Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) who is a judge has had enough of the law. He quits and abruptly returns to India where he grew up and goes looking for his lost love.Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) and Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) lost money investing in a startup company and the cracks in their marriage are showing.Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) is in India for cheap hip replacement surgery.

Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) is here to find romance after several unhappy marriages.The exotic retirement home is a run down hotel run by the inexperienced eager to please Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel.)The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is an enjoyable film that makes the most of its Jaipur setting. The director trust his actors to deliver the goods.It has small scale human stories; love, longing, loneliness. Some see adventure in their retirement in a foreign land, other gets a renewed zest, a few long for home.You just know curmudgeonly Muriel will eventually thaw.

5,nogodnomasters,CELEBRATE THE CHANGES,10,10 June 2019,"The film opens up by giving us quick and witty introductions of the main characters. For one reason or another, they are opting to go live at the Marigold Hotel in India. They are the first guests of this Indian entrepreneur Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel,) in a Hotel that has more character than convenience. Once in India and over the culture shock, our group start to adapt at different rates. Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) keeps an on-line blog about the events which adds some first person narration to the tale.In India, the scenes switch back and forth to the various guests' activities which intersect at times, similar to many indie movie scripts. During this time we get to know the characters much deeper and see them change in a nation of contrast of old traditions and the modern era. The film touches on the caste system and prearranged marriages which are common themes in Bollywood films also.The acting and script were top notch. The film contain the right amount of comedy, drama, and even romance to make for a delightful tale. Dev Patel, whose acting ability I thought was undeveloped in ""Slum Dog Millionaire"" takes it up a notch with this all-star cast. Kudos to Maggie Smith who managed to play a difficult character with perfection.PARENTAL GUIDE: 1 quick totally unnecessary f-bomb with an accent, sexual references, minor back nudity.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
6,kosmasp,Values,6,8 May 2012,"Depending on whether you care or not for certain things, you will rate this higher or lower than I did. Let me be clear about one thing though: The cast is phenomenal! It's a shame I cannot say the same about the script. Not the entire script that is. While it does contain quite a few very nice moments, it does have quite a few flaws too. Our hotel manager is a walking cliché, his ""relationship"" and it's resolution is mediocre at best.It's good seeing a change of pace for Bill Nighy, though his storyline (and his female companion) do not work as good despite his ability to almost overshadow that. Of course this is meant as light fun and the cast obviously had much fun shooting this. I'm not telling you how to feel about the movie, because as mentioned, you might not care for the points I talked about.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
7,jboothmillard,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,7,19 February 2013,"From director John Madden (Mrs Brown, Shakespeare in Love, Captain Corelli's Mandolin), I was very interested to see this film because of the amount of great British actors and actresses in the cast, and I was told by relatives and others it was good. Basically seven English seniors are all coincidentally travelling to Jaipur, India to the enticingly-pitched, not very expensive, newly restored hotel ""for the elderly and beautiful"", the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. They are recently widowed housewife Evelyn Greenslade (Golden Globe nominated Dame Judi Dench), retirees Douglas 'Doug' Ainslie (Bill Nighy) and his wife Jean (Shaun of the Dead's Penelope Wilton) who can afford the trip investing in their daughter's start-up internet company, retired housekeeper Muriel Donnelly (Dame Maggie Smith) who is travelling for an inexpensive hip replacement operation, high court judge Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) who is returning as he lived in India as a child, charming womaniser Norman Cousins (The Jury's Ronald Pickup) who enjoys one night stands, and wealthy Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) who is looking for a husband. When they arrive at the hotel is it a shell of what it used to be, and somewhat decaying, but new young manager Sonny Kapoor (Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel) is very enthusiastic and is sure that things will get better, and slowly the guests grow accustomed to their surroundings, form friendships and have all sorts of small adventures in the hotel and beyond. Jean spends most of her time reading, Doug explores, Graham sees a lot has changed since his childhood, Muriel who seems racist does let the doctor help her, Evelyn gets herself a job to help pay for her stay helping staff with techniques of cold calling and marketing, Madge is trying to date, Norman is not doing well to romance women, and Sonny struggles to convince investors to put money into the hotel. Norman lets go of his usual pulling routine after meeting lifelong English resident Carol (Diana Hardcastle) they begin a relationship, Graham tells Evelyn is trying to find the boyfriend he abandoned at university in India, Jean is attracted to him but is devastated to find out he is gay, he eventually reunites with the former lover who is stuck in an arranged, but he tragically dies of a heart attack, he is cremated in front of the residents. Evelyn and Doug get very close to each other, Jean is becoming increasingly jealous of her husband's activities with her, Sonny is having his more successful brothers wanting the hotel to be knocked down, and he is wanted back in Delhi by his mother Mrs. Kapoor (Lillete Dubey) for an arranged marriage, but he has fallen in love with Evelyn's call centre worker Sunaina (Tena Desae), the hotel residents are told to go when it is declared a financial disaster by the mother. They are all delayed and stopped both by personal feelings and because they have enjoyed their time at the hotel and in India very much, the sceptics are convinced that the hotel just needs better management, and the other guests agree to stay as well and help it to improve, and the end sees Madge finding a wealthy Indiana man, Norman and Carol are with each other and read the Kuma Sutra together, Muriel is at the front desk welcoming new guests, Sonny and Sunaina are happy together, and Evelyn and Doug are seen with each other happy as well. Also starring Liza Tarbuck as Staff Head Nurse Karen, Outnumbered's Ramona Marquez as Madge's Grandchild and Sugar Rush's Sara Stewart as Madge's Daughter. All cast members are very suited to their parts, the story is charming and sweet most of the time, with only the small but needed mushy and emotional bits, the individual plots with the characters are interesting enough, I would say it is mostly for the stars that I liked it, but is a nice feel good movie, a worthwhile comedy drama. It was nominated the BAFTA for Outstanding British Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
8,rmax304823,Exceptional.,8,14 August 2013,"Nobody gets shot. Nobody's head gets wrenched off. There are no filmy pastel curtains half-masking the goings on amid the candles. Somebody ought to give the participants in the production of this movie a medal, just for making an adult movie.Half a dozen late middle-aged Brits, for reasons of their own, find themselves traveling to Jaipur, a city in northwest India. They're booked at what its young manager calls ""the best exotic Marigold Hotel,"" a dilapidated old structure jammed into the middle of a city that overcrowded, aromatic, cacophonous, and overall is what one of the guests calls ""an assault on the senses,"" drawn there by the owner's advert in a British paper designed for people of retirement age -- ""insourcing old age"", he calls it.Initially, their impulse is to seal themselves off front their environment, except for Tom Wilkinson's character, who grew up in Jaipur as a youngster and begins exploring the city in search of his boyhood male lover. Wilkenson's performance could hardly be improved on. But then all of the performances -- Europeans and Indians -- are all better than one might expect.If you're patient, you'll notice that the dialog practically scintillates. The ambitious hotel owner is trying to get a loan to inject into the crumbling hotel, ""and by a small injection I mean in the sense of middle sized."" A wife spends her time holed up in her bedroom, ""naming the cockroaches."" Another woman ""won't eat anything I can't pronounce."" Maggie Smith is invited to visit the enormous family of the hotel's maid. The maid belongs to the untouchables and no one in her family speaks English. So a translator tells Smith that they want to thank her for the kindness she's shown towards the maid. Smith: ""But I haven't BEEN kind!"" Translator: ""Yes, but you are the only one to acknowledge it."" The manager assures a guest that ""everything will be alright in the end, and if it is not alright then it is not the end.""There are many other grace notes, but the movie isn't a comedy -- exactly. It's not ""Carry On In India."" Nor is it exactly a tragedy. It's not nearly as schematic as ""Five Tables"" or quite as portentous as ""A Passage to India."" It's not as penetrating as Satyajit Ray's Apu trilogy, but I recommend it pretty highly.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
9,blanche-2,Everything comes out all right in the end...,10,27 February 2014,"...and if it's not all right, it's not the end.Seven elderly Brits have two things in common: They're all old, and they all decide for various reasons to retire to the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India. For the newly widowed Evelyn, it's a chance for an adventure she never had, rather than sell her place and move in with her son; for Graham (Tom Wilkinson), it's a chance to find someone from his youth; for Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton), they're out of options after giving their daughter all their money for a start-up Internet site; for Muriel (Maggie Smith), it's a free hip replacement; for Madge (Celia Imrie), it's the possibility of a new group of men; and for Norman (Ronald Pickup) it's a chance for some female-type action.When they get to Jaipur, India, the hotel isn't exactly as described -- it's run down, and its manager/part owner Sonny (Dev Patel) is a young, upbeat man full of hope and promises, just not much in the way of business sense.I have no idea what the problem was regarding reviews -- this is such an excellent, funny, warm, poignant film about taking chances, living your dream, and facing old age.Everyone in the cast was wonderful, but there were three standouts, mainly because of their stories: Maggie Smith, especially when she weakly asks Sonny's mother if she knows anything about the computer and getting things ""on the line,"" Judi Dench as a woman who is determined to take advantage of her new freedom, and Tom Wilkinson, looking for someone from his past. Dev Patel as Sonny is a riot, absolutely delightful. We get to know every person and what they bring with them to the experience. For Jean, it's a negative one; for her husband, it's new possibilities. Everyone changes or comes to a realization.Do not hesitate to see this film and remember the words of Sonny: Everything comes out all right in the end, and if it's not all right...it's not the end.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
10,tavm,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel provides the British and Indians at their most charming,9,28 October 2012,"Just watched this British dramady with my mom on Netflix disc. It's about several elderly people who come to India to stay at a hotel for guests their age. Many of them are changed by the experience, one is coming back to search for an old friend, and one misses England dearly. The young manager of the hotel has dreams of making it glorious again. I'll stop there and just say that this was quite touching and funny and things take their leisurely time but one doesn't mind when one meets these people. And with veterans like Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, and especially Maggie Smith, not to mention Dev Patel adding to his Slumdog Millionaire promise, one gets one of the best casts assembled for such a charming movie. So on that note, I highly recommend The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
11,edwagreen,Absolutely-Couldn't Stand It **,3,16 March 2013,"Very disappointed in this so called film dealing with human relationships.Maggie Smith is confined to a wheelchair in the film, and at the last scene, she is suddenly out of it and thriving.Zev Patel possibly goes up a drop of a step further after having appeared in the totally unworthy Oscar winning ""Slumdog Millionaire.""I will say that there is one terrific performance, other than that of the always remarkable Judi Dench. Her name is Penelope Wilton and she is absolutely sensational as the totally negative wife of one of the cast members, an equally fine Bill Nighy.It's a shame when British workers have to retire to this kind of life due the little amount of money they have amassed. You can see that the British Health Care System leaves a lot to be desired by a 6 month wait for a hip replacement.The film is ridden with clichés and it is certainly no ""Passage to India.""",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
12,studioAT,Marigold comedy,5,21 September 2012,Ignore the rather long title and the not exactly inviting poster and watch this film because it really is a lovely gentle comedy that features lots of well known actors at their best. Bill Nighy and Dame Maggie Smith in particular steal the show.My family always struggle to find films that we can all watch together but this film united all ages and was a good evenings entertainment.Fox Searchlight seem to be great at giving little films like this (they also did 500 days of summer)a bit more exposure and Marigold Hotel does deserve it.Overall a fun comedy that is well worth watching.,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
13,hitchcockthelegend,Critics not touched by this deserve a dose of the Delhi Belly!,9,29 August 2012,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is directed by John Madden and adapted to screenplay by Ol Parker form the novel These Foolish Things written by Deborah Moggach. It stars Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie and Dev Patel. Music is scored by Thomas Newman and cinematography by Ben Davis.A group of English pensioners retire to Jaipur, India, where they had hoped to be staying in the luxuriously advertised The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Upon their arrival, however, they find a hotel far from the idyll they were expecting. But swayed by the ebullience of young manager Sonny, they decide to stick it out and find themselves embarking on new life adventures in the twilight of their lives.I'm not eating anything I can't pronounce!A prime cast of elder British actors gather for this utterly beautiful movie. At times touching, at others funny, it's the sort of well produced picture that gets taken for granted by snooty critics who can't see past the end of their nose. Picture basically thrusts all its characters into life affirming/changing situations, their fears, hang-ups and closet terrors are all laid bare under the pleasant Indian sun. The messages are played out in bold type, but this is a great thing since the writing is so delicate, and it of course helps that the cast performances are superb. With the film set in Jaipur, we also get a peek at Indian culture, how the populace live everyday life, while the young love strand involving Dev Patel and Tena Desae is no hindrance to the elderly relationships, this is because it acts as a counter point to love being relevant at any stage of life. It's just one of the big themes in a film that is undeniably big on heart.Watch and pick your favourite character, your favourite moment, and maybe keep the Kleenex handy as well. A beautiful and involving picture for the young and old to enjoy. 9/10",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
14,neil-476,Don't just sit there reading reviews - go and see it!,10,2 March 2012,"We are introduced to a number of people: Evelyn (Judi Dench) has lost her husband after 40 years and is struggling to cope with the debts he left; Recently retired civil servant Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton), penniless due to investing in their daughter's unsuccessful business, are appalled at the prospect of a retirement flat in an old folks' compound; Madge (Celia Imrie) may be faded, but isn't ready to call it a day yet; Muriel (Maggie Smith), embittered after a lifetime in service and the disappearance of her country behind faces she doesn't recognise, finds her much-needed hip replacement outsourced to a cheaper provider; Graham (Tom Wilkinson) retires as a judge and decides he must try to find something he lost in his youth; and Ageing old goat Norman decides to pursue the hunt somewhere new.These 7 people, for their different reasons, find themselves in Jaipur, the first residents of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (for the Old and Beautiful), an establishment which does not quite reach the photoshopped standards of its brochure, and which is run with more enthusiasm than acumen by Sonny (Dev Patel).Yes, folks, it's another movie about old people. But it has a classy cast, a sparkling script, some genuinely affecting character arcs (Sunny, too has things going on), and the sights and sounds of India.I saw this in a cinema full of people who, like myself, are no longer in the full flush of youth, and there was a strong sense of identification. But that's not the end of it, because the film is much stronger than that. There was a lot of laughter - much of this film is very funny, and there are some terrific one liners - and an appreciation of the performances. Of course, with a cast of this calibre, one expects no less than first rate, but they all deliver at least to that expected standard. I particularly liked Penelope Wilton's brittle Jean, let down and angry, but always putting the very British cheery public face over the top of her deep unhappiness, and Bill Nighy as husband Douglas, kind, positive, faithful and loyal and, perhaps, capable of being provoked beyond the point where he can bear it any more. Yet all are excellent.This film is warm, witty, funny, touching, and deep but without being preachy. Even though it is only February, 2012 will have to come up with something special to produce a better film this year.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
15,ferguson-6,Outsourcing Old Age,7,6 May 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. The closest I can come to saying anything negative about the film is that it is a bit predictable. That said, it is quite an entertaining ride to take with some of Britain's best actors. Filled with both comedy and insight, the Ol Parker script of the Deborah Moggach novel (""These Foolish Things"") may be the jump start to a new film genre ... gray cinema.In the pre-opening credit sequence, we get introductions to seven Brits who are at a crossroads in life ... each past the career stage (either voluntarily or otherwise) but not ready to disappear into a meaningless existence waiting to die. They each respond to an advertisement for a hotel in Jaipur, India which caters to the ""elderly and beautiful"". Its biggest selling point may be the low cost of retirement. Still, it's an adventure of the scale most of our heroes have never taken.We meet Evelyn (Judi Dench) as the recent widow who discovers her beloved husband left her a mountain of debt; Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) a hapless married couple who have invested their savings into their daughter's internet company; Muriel (Maggie Smith) is a racist career nanny and housekeeper for the rich who has been put out to pasture in need of a new hip; Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a high court judge who is fed up with responsibility and seeking to reconnect with a long ago lover; Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) are the lonely hearts looking for love, or in his case, loving.They arrive at the Indian resort to be met by its proprietor Sonny, a wildly exuberant and overly optimistic Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire). Sonny has inherited the rundown property from his father and has huge dreams of turning it into a showplace for retirees from abroad ... he literally wants to outsource old age for all the countries who have no use for the elderly. A sad truth for both the English and Americans.The joy of the story comes from the transformation of each of the characters as they slowly discover more about the country and, in turn, more about themselves. Graham's discovery is especially touching, while Jean's takes a proverbial slap in the face from her long-suffering, quasi-henpecked husband Douglas. Even young Sonny learns about life decisions thanks to his guests and the actions of his mother and girlfriend.With the general population aging, expect to see more films in this vein ... aimed at the age group who is approaching the crossroads, but not yet ready to give up living. Director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) has delivered a charming seriocomedy, but I expect others will take a more in-depth and analytical view at some point.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
16,anaconda-40658,Exotic Best.,8,16 February 2016,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011): Dir: John Madden / Cast: Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel: Delightful British comedy drama that present the illusion of a stress free vacation for the elderly, while its subjects arrive to phones that do not work, taps that drip in the night, doors that are non existent, and a culture they fail to understand. Director John Madden gave us Shakespeare in Love, but here he presents a somewhat modern take on Shakespearian themes with a touch of humour. Great ensemble cast includes Tom Wilkinson as someone coming to terms with the fact that he is gay and he returns to India in hopes to address a past relationship that he fears that he shamed. Judi Dench must deal with debts of her deceased husband, but finds employment and fulfilment during her time in India. Bill Nighy plays a frustrated and bullied husband who celebrates the culture around him while his wife of forty years complains constantly. Maggie Smith brings humour as a racist woman in need of a hip replacement, but her attitude is tested when confronted with the lifestyles around her. They all occupy this rundown hotel that is beloved with great enthusiasm by its young owner who himself is facing young love. Dev Patel plays the hotel manager who goes out of his way to please these guests and provide comic relief. While all is cheerful and innocent, it does present the dismiss of one marriage, as well as several subplots that are somewhat disjointed. That should not prevent adults from checking in and enjoying their time at the hotel elderly. Score: 8 / 10",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
17,HotToastyRag,So heartwarming,10,14 February 2021,"When everyone watched the preview for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, they realized this ""old folks still got it"" comedy would be delightful and impossible to resist. We flocked to the theaters and weren't disappointed. Now, I own a well-worn DVD copy and have lost track of how many times I've seen it.In a heartwarming, funny, dramatic, hopeful, romantic leap of faith, five single strangers and one married couple decide to uproot their lives in England to live in a new hotel in India that respects the aging process. The brochure and online advertisements look lovely and send a message that they're not getting at home: you can still have dignity and a full life in your sunset years! But when they get there, the grounds are crumbling, the rooms are unfinished, and the hotel manager (remember the kid from Slumdog Millionaire?) is a flaky wreck. But each person has traveled all that way for different reasons and they decide to stay for a little while longer. And as Dev Patel frequently reminds them, ""Everything will be alright in the end. If it is not alright, it is not yet the end."" (My dad's in love with that phrase, so I hear it much more often than just in the movie!)Of the charming, varied residents, there are Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton, a married couple without much retirement money who have come as a last resort. Bill quickly adapts to his surroundings, but Penelope has difficulty coming to terms with the destruction of all her dreams. While it may appear Penelope gets the short end of the stick in this movie by playing ""the bad girl"", the more times you watch the movie, you realize she's not the villainess at all! My heart goes out to her in every scene. Her nuanced performance makes the role so much more than it could have been.Judi Dench is a naïve widow who not only has to forge ahead without her husband but has to learn to survive on her own for the first time. In India, she gets her first job! Tom Wilkinson is a respectable judge, the only one of the bunch who's been to India before. He has personal reasons for returning. Maggie Smith has been sent, against her will, for a hip replacement surgery, and she's not happy to be surrounded by people who look different. But when you finally hear her life story, your heart goes out to her, too. Celia Imrie (also known as the ""bigger buns lady"" from Calendar Girls) and Ronald Pickup are players who don't let a little change of scenery stop their quest for romance. They get to rattle off the funniest line in the whole movie, a caution of sleeping with someone when they're old.No matter how many times I watch it, my heart jumps a little during the scene at the airport. All seven of them sit downs strangers, and I always feel a little jolt of magic knowing they're about to join each other's lives in remarkable ways. From, ""This is the day!"" to ""Do you want me to not fix that chair?"" this heartwarming movie is full of memorable moments. And best of all, it treats older folks just like the fictional hotel set out to do: with dignity and respect as full human beings who happen to have wrinkles and gray hair.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
18,phd_travel,Overrated,1,18 November 2013,This is an overrated shallow and ugly movie. Don't be fooled by the A list British cast. Shallow and uninteresting characters and relationships There is no old folks charm here as in Quartet. The characters are uninteresting clichéd and shallow. The gay character (Tom Wilkinson) seems thrown in to be current. Not much humor here in any of the dialog. The romance is unconvincing especially Bill Nighy and Judi Dench. Ugly images Don't expect any Passage to India magic here. It focuses on an unattractive hotel and very ugly parts of the city. Slums and dirty roads. Only agree with Penelope Wilton - sick of the squalor. Want to get out of this movie like she wanted to get out of the city.Forget about this.

There's a body of complaints on the opposite end, who cry the well-worn trope of ""political correctness"" if one tries to criticise the western lens through which the movie is made.It is what is is, nothing more, nothing less. The movie was directed by a British man and the writers are British I believe, but I stand to be corrected so one should expect a Western lens to the movie. I mean even Slumdog Millionaire was directed by a British man!! Also, if the roles were reversed and the film was directed and written by Indians and set in the UK with Indian expatriates, you can expect every British stereotype to come to the fore, e.g. Buckingham Palace, politeness, Sherlock, Midsomer Murders, fry-ups, etc.I think there should be a remake of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, this time with an Indian director, and it would be interesting to see what unfolds.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Boating one of the finest casts of veteran actors from England it is a film that pays attention to the lives and emotions of senior citizens - and has a terrific time in the process.A group of British retirees decide to ""outsource"" their retirement to less expensive and seemingly exotic India to take up residence in what they believe is a newly restored hotel. Less luxurious than its advertisements, the Marigold Hotel nevertheless slowly begins to charm in unexpected ways. The story begins in London where the brief but necessary groundwork for our group of elder citizens is established - the frustrations of retirement, the death of a husband, the crumbling of a marriage of convenience, and the need for feeling physically attractive when facing a mirror. Once our entourage arrives in Jaipur (amongst the squalor of poverty matched by the sense of freedom of living in the moment) they are greeted by the young manager Sonny (Dev Patel) of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, whose enthusiasm and optimism suffuse the entire film.The new tenants are a varied bunch: Muriel (Maggie Smith) has come to India (despite her hideous bigotry and racism) for a hip replacement, Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a new widow unable to afford a retirement home in England and longing for adventure, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and his chronically cranky wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) likewise cannot afford the embarrassment and finances of a British retirement facility, Norman (Ronald Pickup) who cannot 'face' aging and the lack of feminine accompaniment, Madge (Celia Imrie) who longs to discover a man to love, and Graham (Tom Wilkerson) a gay man whose lived in the closet in England forever guilty about his true love he left in India many years ago. Stir this kettle, add romance (not only from Sonny and his lower caste girlfriend Sunaina -Tena Desae, but also the awakening of new love in most all of the tenants o the Marigold), and out pours a film of physical beauty, memorable bits of philosophy from both the old and young, and a sense of discovery which is always at the end - 'or it isn't the end.' Highly recommended for old AND young. Grady Harp,",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
21,zetes,A movie solely for the elderly,6,16 December 2012,"A film made solely to appeal to old people. I don't think anyone else needs to bother with it. Not that it's awful. It's just plain mediocre. Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and a few other elderly Brits relocate to a hotel in India. Run by Slumdog Millionaire star Dev Patel, it's far less glamorous than the pamphlets have advertised. Still, as time moves on, most of them become more and more charmed by it. The actors are fine. I particularly liked Wilkinson and Patel (although I dislike the whole Indian marriage subplot, which any Western movie about Indian characters always has to go for). The plot is just dull. No surprises whatsoever.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

A great film starring seven of Britain's most accomplished actors. Dev Patel, the star of Slumdog Millionaire, returns to the big screen as dedicated determined hotel manager in Jaipur, India. Dev does a terrific job in acting alongside Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench. Penelope Wilton OBE outshines then as negative Jean Ainslie. Supporting cast includes Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson OBE and Ronald Pickup OBE. The movie sends a message about dreams coming true and you're never too old to fall in love.

23,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,8,27 May 2012,"There are only a handful of films featuring senior citizen characters that I enjoy, the top of the list being Cocoon, if only because these films usually have an extremely moving story about love, life and inevitably will touch on death, and better yet, has an ensemble cast of veteran actors well worth their weight in gold. Based on the novel titled These Foolish Things by Deborah Moggach, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel contains the same ingredients, and watching the cast here playing characters going about seeking a new life, is therapeutic, moving and tugging at your heartstrings.It took a while for director John Madden to get everything up to speed, compartmentalizing all the characters here in their individual arcs and introducing each of their emotional baggage. There's Evelyn (Judi Dench) whose husband had recently passed away and leaving behind huge debts, Graham (Tom Wilkinson) the court judge who walked out of his profession with unfinished personal business abandoned in India during his growing up years, Muriel (Maggie Smith) a retired housekeeper no longer required by her household seeking cheaper surgical procedures in India, Madge (Celia Imrie) a gold digger looking for a wealthy husband, a counterpart of sorts in Norman (Ronald Pickup) looking for one night stands with any woman, and finally the couple Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) who lost their retirement savings when invested into their daughter's failed internet startup.All of them got enticed by the plan to retire in India, which in many ways given the exchange rate, even some of us have been told to outsource our retirement to countries with a lower cost of living. So they pack up and leave, meet each other in planes and airports, before finding their way to the city of Jaipur where they stayed in the titular hotel, a property that had seen better days, now run by the proprietor's son Sonny (Dev Patel) who is adamant in bringing the hotel back to its glory days. But for now it's time for his new visitors to get acquainted with living together under the same run down conditions, and experiencing the new sights and sounds that Jaipur has to offer, for them and for us the audience.Madden and of course Moggach's story is the quintessential ode to a romanticized India as a destination, where there is immense beauty from the chaos, and lessons to be learnt from its citizen. The country and the city present opportunities for anyone to learn more about oneself, and it is here in this new environment that the stories - feel good, moving, tragic and the likes, all get set to reveal themselves, and with an ensemble there are many tales to be told, with Evelyn finding new purpose imparting knowledge in a call center, Graham finding it an uphill task to track someone he once knew, Madge and Norman forming a bond of sorts in their common quest to look for potential pick ups in the same societal places, Muriel learning to overcome her racial prejudices, and the cracks between Douglas and Jean begin to rear their ugly heads, with the former finding himself drawn toward Evelyn and the latter toward Graham. It's extremely multi-dimensional in the development of these characters, and we grow to like even the most negative of the lot since the characters become real and never for once felt contrived, sharing similar anxieties, fears, optimism and hope.As these relationships and friendships develop, we also have Dev Patel's Sonny romancing a call centre employee Sunaina (Tena Desae), much to the objection of Sonny's mother who is determined that he marries someone else that is arranged, rather than to go on a love marriage. It's the typical clash of the expectations between the older and current generation that one would already have seen in various Bollywood films, rehashing certain themes that are staple in those films. And through Sonny and the other characters, themes like living the dream, staying fearless despite failure, to understand and empathise with others, and not to judge any book by its cover, come to encompass the narrative, making the movie one that has pretty good messages delivered under the auspices of a feel good film.If given an opportunity, I too would like to embark on that soul searching trip to India, and seek out similar experiences staying in an equivalent of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Highly recommended!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
24,siderite,"Brilliant cast, nice script, a bit too cheery, but that's OK",8,29 November 2012,"The plot of the film is similar to, say, Crash, only a lot more positive. There are people, different but interesting, that meet in the same hotel in India. They are all old and so they each have a little bit of drama in their life, but also a little bit of hope. So let's see where that takes them.The cast is the main strength of the film. I can imagine the same script with young American actors and it would pretty much suck. However these brilliant actors make the entire experience feel magical. The script is OK, but not perfect, with that funny ""Indian saying"" said three times, as if repeating it would make it have more power. Well, it does not. Some of the story doesn't really make sense, either. But it doesn't matter so much. The film is good, wonderfully played, based on a book, complex and captivating.The biggest failure of the film is the attempt to make it suitable for both young and old people, so they mix the complexity of a long life with the cheery, almost playful hope theme. They don't really mix, making the film seem stunted, painted bright red. Yet in the end it is a feel good movie, so maybe I am wrong. On any account, a good worthwhile film.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
25,JamesHitchcock,Soap Opera for the Elderly and Beautiful,6,12 March 2015,"Ever since the 1980s, the decade of ""Heat and Dust"", ""A Passage to India"" and the television adaptation of ""The Jewel in the Crown"", the British entertainment industry has been having a love-affair with all things Indian. Or perhaps I should say with some things Indian. This affair has produced a considerable number of offspring, but most of the resulting films and television programmes (""Indian Summers"" being the most recent example) have been concerned with the days of the Raj and have featured more British characters than Indian ones. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" is a notable exception, a British film about Indian people in modern India. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is another recent British film about modern India, but here again the majority of the characters are British. The basic (and rather unlikely idea) is that a group of old-age pensioners move from Britain to a retirement hotel in Jaipur. They have various reasons for doing so. The recently widowed Evelyn is forced to look for somewhere cheaper to live after her late husband left her heavily in debt. Married couple Jean and Douglas also have financial problems, in their case caused by an unwise investment in their daughter's internet company. Graham, a retired high-court judge, wants to return to the land where he spent his boyhood (although, as will become clear, he has other reasons for wanting to see India again). The several times married Madge is hunting for another husband, and Norman, an ageing Lothario, is also looking for romance. Muriel is a bigoted racist who detests the non-white races in general and Indians in particular, but only intends to stay in India temporarily in order to have a hip operation carried out. A further subplot deals with Sonny, the young Indian manager of the hotel, and his romance with a local girl. The film stars some of the best known among the older generation of British screen actors, including Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson, but it does suffer from a defect common to a number of recent films, both British and American, namely too many subplots in one story and insufficient space to develop them all fully. (""Love Actually"" is another recent British film with a similar problem). Of the various plot lines I most liked the touching story of Graham and his search for his lost love, and the account of how Jean and Douglas's already failing marriage is doomed by their differing personalities and differing reactions to their new surroundings. Douglas- a natural optimist even in his old age- finds himself falling in love with India, whose new-found culture is a source of wonder to him, whereas Jean, the sort of person who is only happy when she has something to be unhappy about, loathes the country and cannot wait to get back to Britain. The Muriel subplot struck me as too predictable; you just can't cast a national treasure like Dame Maggie Smith as a National Front-type racist, so it was pretty obvious from the beginning that Muriel's violent prejudices would undergo a 180-degree U-turn as soon as she actually met any real Indians. Smith's contemporary and fellow-Dame Judi Dench played Evelyn with her normal elegance and dignity, although I felt that the role really had been written with someone younger in mind. The romance which develops between Evelyn and Douglas after his separation from Jean becomes less plausible when one considers that Dame Judi is actually fifteen years older than Bill Nighy. (Nighy, only 61 when the film was made, does not really qualify as an OAP). Director John Madden described Dev Patel, who plays Sonny, as a ""comic natural - a sort of Jacques Tati figure"", but I wondered whether Patel had in fact made Sonny a bit too comic in a film which is not altogether a comedy. Sonny is friendly, cheerful and enthusiastic, but is not an entirely sympathetic figure, as it becomes all too clear that he is using his friendliness, cheerfulness and enthusiasm as a cover to hide his incompetence and inexperience when it comes to running a hotel. (Jean's eternal complaints are not always unjustified). You can judge his level of business acumen from the full name he has given to his hotel- ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful"". I just couldn't see what the lovely Sunaina saw in him. Of the film as a whole, Madden said that his characters were ""entering a strange world removed from their former reality, cut off from their past, where they have to invent a new life for themselves,"" but not all of the story lines have any necessary connection to India. The stories of Norman and Madge, for example, could just as easily have taken place in a retirement community on the Costa Brava, or for that matter in Worthing or Eastbourne. The Indian location merely serves to add a touch of exotic colour. The film did good business at the box-office, and some of the acting (principally from Wilkinson, Dench and Nighy) is very good, but it is essentially little more than a soap opera for the elderly and beautiful. 6/10",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It is ""what we hope to be in the future."" Where the plot gets muddled is that they go to India for faster service and wind up staying long term at the hotel.The comedy here is British, often subtle, and definitely understated.. There is some mild racism with one character. A little comedy with sexual references, and some mild jokes, many of which I have heard before.Because of the cast and the circumstances I enjoyed the film.

28,lasttimeisaw,Two Dames cannot save the feel-good exotic dramedy,6,16 October 2012,"Oscar-nominated director John Madden's post-Shakespeare IN LOVE (1998, 8/10) path might insinuate that he hasn't secured an esteemed status as a distinctive auteur, and the hindsight is that it should be a great relief he didn't win that year (Gwyneth Paltrow has't quite rehabilitated herself from the curse yet).This time round, Madden assembles a cluster of British senior thespians (seven is the exact number), lead by Madden's longtime collaborator Dame Judi Dench and the venerable Dame Maggie Smith, to explore their retired lives in India, staying at the titular hotel which is more of a home for the elderly, run by a vigorous local young man (a fast-speaking and slightly annoying Dev Pavel). Every and each one experiences some kind of upheaval in their life here, in a foreign land, where is vividly colorful and disparate from the Great Britain, the culture shock could never be properly anticipated (although India was once its colony).The script intends to encompass all the realistic situations one will inevitably face when reaching their ages (an unhappily married couple, a recent widow, a gay man, a middle-aged gold digger, an elder sex-pursuer, a childless spinster) but is executed in a not-so-splendid curve, the part of Tom Wilkinson's root-seeking is the most endearing and affecting one and the scene of a crane hovering around before an inadvertent turn of the plot has its symbolistic weight on its viewers, but otherwise, there are barely any acumen within the screenplay (Dev Pavel's juggling between his girl and mother is the most corny one, and performance-wise, they're not on a par with the rest of the cast).But since there are not too many films in the market specifically aiming at the elderly-skewed demography and the all-star dream team does shoot in their usual range (I give Wilkinson and Nighy comfy niches in my top 10 supporting actor list, while two Dames are very near my 10 ranking, Dench for leading actress and Smith for supporting actress respectively, and I count films according to their calendar year, so what I mean is 2011 list exactly, but it is way too soon to rule out their chances in the Oscar competition next year as both in the supreme hierarchy where the academy members dare not to bypass.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

The plot is about couple of old British couples going to India because each one of them has there own reasons and agenda. Although some of the characters cope and struggle with the different culture and way of life in India. All the actors and actresses did a fine job playing their roles. And the transitions of these characters has heart to it and is believable. In fact all the situations the characters in this movie goes through is engaging. The comedic elements in this movie is one of those cute humors but it really works in this film. Dev Patel didn't stand out in any role nor did he get many roles after ""Slumdog Millionaire"". But he is one of the entertaining aspect of this movie and brings out the bright comedic relief in this movie. He plays the owner of the hotel and is one of those characters that is almost impossible to dislike. Overall this is a heartfelt feel good movie that I thoroughly enjoyed and is a must see.

The viewer gets introduced to seven elderly Brits, who are off to India because, well, they're elderly, they're bored, they're lonely, they're troubled. To remedy that they've discovered a supposed paradise hotel in Jaipur, India that caters to elderly people. So, off they go. The Indian characters have their own issues revolving around love and respect. The stories of the two groups interweave. Truly, though, the first hour is awfully tough slogging.The elderly Brits are actually composed of a pretty good cast, with actors like Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy among others. And they were given a little more to do in the second hour of the movie that almost made watching this movie verge on the worthwhile. The problem was that I had largely lost the flow of the story because the first hour was so uninspiring. That second half does become a little bit humorous at times and it offers some interesting philosophical reflections about life and aging. All things considered, things work out perhaps a little bit too well for everyone involved in this. The overall story here is quite weak, and - solid cast aside - it's far too slow on the start.

31,Hellmant,The cast does their best to sell it.,6,19 September 2012,"'THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL': Three Stars (Out of Five)A British comedy-drama film featuring an all-star cast of veteran actors (including Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie and Penelope Wilton) as well as Dev Patel (of 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' fame). It's directed by John Madden (the critically acclaimed director of the Oscar winning 'SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE' as well as last year's espionage thriller 'THE DEBT', and many others) and written by Ol Parker. It's based on the book 'These Foolish Things' by Deborah Moggach about a small group of British retirees who move in to a newly opened retirement hotel in India. The film is a light hearted tale about finding new inspiration in life. It's also light on laughs and emotion but it's definitely not a bad film and the cast does their best to sell it. The story revolves around an old run down hotel in India being reopened as a retirement hotel by an enthusiastic young manager named Sonny (Patel). He sells the idea, through misleading brochures, to a group of elderly British people looking to retire for various reasons. The group includes a couple (Nighy and Wilton) who poorly invested in their daughter's internet company, a retired housekeeper needing a hip replacement (Smith), a gold digger looking to find a husband (Imrie), a former lady's man looking to recapture his glory days (Pickup), a widow (Dench) starting a job as a call centre adviser and a recently retired judge (Wilkinson) who grew up in India as a boy. Each of course is trying to refind happiness and learns something from their adventure while Sonny tries to follow his dreams and continue to court a young woman his mother (Lillete Dubey) doesn't approve of. The film is full of beautiful cinematography and is nicely directed by Madden. Like I said the cast all does their best, especially Patel who really should be a bigger star by now given his talent. The movie is touching at times and funny but nothing too memorable. It never tugs at the emotions in ways you'd expect from a movie like this and the comedy is mostly routine. It's all material that's been done many times before, in better ways, but it is adequately made (for what it is) for the most part.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7YhqgcaX3Q",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
32,g-bodyl,A Delightful Surprise!,9,17 December 2013,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is one of the most freshest, surprising films of 2012. Despite their extreme talent, who would have thought a bunch of aging British stars would effectively lead a comedy like this film. It's refreshing to see a film that aims at a 50-plus demographic. I really enjoyed this heart-warming movie and I'm still a young person. This movie proves that you don't have to have young people or explosions to make a successful film.John Madden's film is about seven British retirees who travel to the Indian city of Jaipur where they stay at this broken-down hotel. While there, they find the comfort in friendship and even unsuspecting romance begins to blossom.Needless to say, this film is well-acted. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith are in their late 70's, but they don't act it here. With some sly British humor, they effectively make their mark. Tom Wilkinson is really good and is a surprising man in this film. But I believe Bill Nighy is the best of the all. The scene he has towards the end with his mean, negative-nancy wife is just full of emotion and poignancy.Overall, this film managed to warm my heart and I was left was a fuzzy feeling for awhile afterwards. Who knew this movie would be this moving. Maybe it will make me not take life for granted as I get older. The older generations will definitely love this movie, but it's something the younger one should check out. This film has some deep meanings about life and living it to the fullest. With a funny script and great acting, this film is one to see. I rate this film 9/10.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

What's great is that we deal with so many characters who are so unique in their own ways. It's great to see a movie about the romantic lives of the elderly. Through all this, the mostly younger audience still has a character to associate with, Sonny. He's probably the most interesting character here and it's great to see the main Indian character interact with the British folk. What's truly nice is his relationship with his girlfriend and how he defies the arranged marriage his family puts him up to it. You would be surprised at how often those still happen in real life, especially in India.It also helps that the setting is so beautiful. Seeing as how it has such a high population, we really should be aware of India and its massive impact on the rest of the world. It's just great to see all the people walking around, swimming and relishing in their culture. There are so many different kinds of problems that these characters come across. It's probably the first movie to feature an elderly man coming out of the closet. One of the characters dies and others have trouble with their sex lives. Everyone is just so charming and authentic in this.I felt like the pacing was great too. It really gets better in the second half as we get more conflict and more characters reacting. More or less, it works out. These people don't even look that old, but maybe that's because these actors are so active. ***1/2 out of ****.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Well acted, charming script, fun and politically correct and just mildly exotic. And a chance to get to see a few first rate British talent relaxed and almost having fun for its own sake.We can't expect this kind of movie to plumb new depth about human relationship, to bridge British-Indian gulfs in one swoop, or to strive for a high art aesthetic. This is almost a formula film about a ""ship of fools"" where a group of disparate people or suddenly stuck together and they gradually unveil who they really are to each other and to the reader/viewer. It's almost always fun, and has a long history in literature and film.And it's naturally an interwoven tale of half a dozen older people as well as the young hotel proprietor and his girlfriend in India (an unspecified smaller city). Love blooms and stale relationships come into view. Generational gaps are confronted. A gay man comes to terms to a past encounter, and with his own present openness. And the cultural shock of India (for some) is accommodated in a way that makes the movie a little bit of a travelogue, too.Director John Madden has a short resume with lots of television on it, but he also directed the winning ""Shakespeare in Love,"" and his feel for the medium without pushing boundaries is clear. I'm actually looking forward to more from him simply for his easy touch.It's all perfectly delightful. It's all rather warm and enjoyable. If there are not breakthroughs or revelations for most of us, the movie still manages to show how we all can be young as we get old, and can change and be more tolerant, and even start all over again.

38,vincentlynch-moonoi,Nice to see a very popular movie for the more mature viewer,7,31 May 2012,"Today was an interesting movie experience. A Thursday 1 p.m. showing, and the theater showing this film was quite full. Admittedly, I think everyone was over 50, but it was nice to see a film an older American audience is really into. And, that seems to be holding true nationwide as this film does a very decent business both here and overseas.I was not aware of this film until just a few days ago. It kind of made me homesick -- I lived in Thailand for a couple of years, and I saw lots that reminded me a very different culture.Those who say this is a comedy are wrong...although there are many very funny situations in it. In fact, lots of laughing by the audience. But I see it more as a drama. The premise is simple -- several older Brits decide to try retirement in a hotel in India, which is run by a young Indian fellow (Dev Patel) whose father owned a rather unsuccessful hotel, and he is trying to resurrect it.The cast is stunning: Judi Dench plays Evelyn, whose husband recently died. Her house is being sold to pay off her husband's debts, so she decides to try life in the hotel that advertises itself as a home for the ""elderly and beautiful"". In the end, she finds a new romance...and finally happiness.Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton play Douglas and Jean, a long-married couple who are only beginning to realize that there is no reason to remain married. They are dragging each other down into unhappiness, and in India they finally realize it and happily split...she back to England, he on to a romance with Evelyn.Maggie Smith plays Muriel, a sort of Archie Bunkerish ex-housekeeper who is bitter about life. When her doctor tells her she must have hi replacement, and she learns that in England it will take 6 months to arrange, but that in India it can be done immediately, she moves to the Marigold Hotel. Her racism against the Indians finally begins to fade with the excellent medical care she receives and an unlikely friendship with a maid who is in the ""untouchable"" class. In the end, she not only bounces back health-wise, but also saves the hotel! Tom Wilkinson's role as Graham is one of the most interesting. He plays a judge who decides to retire to Indian, where he spent time when he was young. Gay time. And, he feels guilty for having brought disgrace to his young Indian male lover. He is finally persuaded to contact him, with quite a different outcome than he expected. But, once they have made peace, he passes away from a heart attack.Ronald Pickup plays Norman, who misses his days as a lothario. A little Viagra does the trick...although he is not aware that his new conquest switched the Viagra with aspirin...but he still charges ahead...and finds a new and more meaningful life.Celia Imrie plays Madge, a woman who has never really found love.This is not any one actor's movie...much more an ensemble cast, and delightful in just about every way.While a lot of young people probably wouldn't like this film, it's a hard film for a mature person not to like.I give it a very strong ""7"". Highly recommended.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

40,Red-125,An interesting showcase for some great actors,8,1 July 2012,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (2011), directed by John Madden, is an interesting film that's worth seeing. It has great actors--Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, and Maggie Smith, among others. The plot premise is good--several English retirees, none of whom is really well off, decide to move to India to live in a charming hotel. Of course, once they arrive in India, they learn that the hotel is--at best--a work in progress. The characters bring with them their strengths, weaknesses, and prejudices. India, and the other hotel guests, allow them to change and grow to meet the new challenges they encounter.I've never been to India, so I can't comment on the validity of the outdoor scenes. However, they look realistic to me. In any event, the movie captures the color, the noise, and the crowding to be found in a large Indian city.There's a weak secondary plot involving a romance between the young hotel manager and the woman he loves. Naturally, there are obstacles to the marriage, and, obviously these obstacles must be overcome before the movie can end. Trite as this plot may be, I defy any viewer not to be caught up in the romance, and not to want the young people to finally end up together.This is a film that will work better on the large screen, because of the many excellent crowd scenes. However, it's worth looking for on DVD if you can't find it in a theater. It's not a great film, but it's worth seeing, and I don't hesitate to recommend it.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
41,TheMovieDiorama,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel showcases the vintage talent of some of Britain's finest actors.,8,24 February 2018,"If there ever was such a likeable, watchable, enthralling, witty, hilarious and heartbreaking film, it's this one. Who knew a group of people in their golden years moving to India would make for such a fun and moving film. It's a story about rediscovery. Rediscovering one's self, rediscovering life and rediscovering happiness. Making the most out of what you have left, embracing a new and foreign lifestyle and just tackling new obstacles that are thrown your way. The sheer resonating force the the plot is filled with is exceedingly joyous and is sure to make you smile with glee. Evoking a variety of emotions from happiness to sorrow. It's a whirlwind, both in its narrative and themes. With more than eight lively characters to fuel the story, you would imagine balancing their screen time to be quite the challenge. Alas, screenwriter Ol Parker and director John Madden utilise their experience to overcome this obstacle, and with vibrancy. I mean the script contains British wit that makes the film ever so charming. A racist Dame Maggie Smith, a gay Tom Wilkinson, a grieving Judi Dench and a promiscuous Ronald Pickup are just a few enigmatic characters that stay in the hotel. Perhaps trying too hard to cater for a wide variety of character types. Some characters are more developed than others, and certain elements in the plot are rushed because of this, however it's well balanced overall. Then injecting the urban Indian culture into the mix with a seasoning of love, and we have ourselves an international hit. The recipe works and clearly the results show. Everyone gave excellent performances that provided much needed emotion. The beauty of such talent on and off screen means that it is accessible by all ages. Every type of audience can appreciate and be engaged with what is being shown. Some may consider this to be too ""fluffy"", but come on...sometimes we just need a nice film to cheer us up!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
42,Movie_Muse_Reviews,These British vets get great mileage out of this predictable material,6,24 December 2012,"Where do Britain's finest actors go when they retire? The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur, India, apparently. A who's who of mature British talent, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" could be considered a more British ""Love, Actually"" or "" Valentine's Day"" for seniors, minus the sinister commercial intent.The film follows several British retirees who read of the restored titular hotel in India and for various reasons determine to vacation there. The place turns out to be in dire need of renovations, but its charismatic manager, Sonny (Dev Patel), charms them into staying, not that they have much choice in the middle of India.The main character is Evelyn (Judi Dench), a recent widow who has sold her home to pay off her debt. She narrates the film, but her story doesn't necessarily get more attention than any other. Along with her is Graham (Tom Wilkinson), a respected judge who used to live in India as a boy, Muriel (Maggie Smith), a rather racist retired housekeeper in need a speedy and inexpensive hip replacement, Doug (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton), a couple in need of affordable retirement, Madge (Celia Imrie), who seeks love in her later years and Norman (Ronald Pickup), a Lothario who just won't quit.Naturally, the trip becomes life-changing for all of them, changing their perspectives and notions about life even after all these years living a certain way. Even Sonny has his own subplot involving his girlfriend Sunaina (Tena Desae), of whom his mother does not approve.Based on the Deborah Moggach novel ""These Foolish Things,"" Ol Parker's script is a pretty straightforward setup with an obvious payoff. It's only a question of which of the hotel guests will fall for each other. All of the other twists come drenched in predictability.There's only one way for a film to overcome such severe formula, and that's with loads of talent capable of of convincing us to care about it. Like a group of British all-stars, perhaps ... Each actor brings such gravitas to the film and vulnerability to his or her character that you feel for and sympathize with all of them to some extent and take interest in all the interweaving plots turning out as formula says they will. Even though the film is a two-hour juggling act, there's a lot of truth to what ""the formula"" has to say, even if you feel like you've heard it before. The fact that these are senior actors provides not only a change of pace for the ensemble romantic comedy, but also their wealth of life experience helps subvert the clichés. Even if each actor can't relate to personally to the part, he or she probably knows someone that could literally connect with or understand their character.Dench is a particular standout as a character dealing with loss. She doesn't let it consume her character and seep into her acting choices, but plays Eveyln as someone strong-willed yet ultimately still vulnerable. The dame never disappoints. Smith also stands out as she plays a despicable character whose change of heart is convincing enough that you manage to like Muriel in the end — a lot. And considering this cast of acting giants, Patel never gets overshadowed and reinforces why he deserves to be considered as more than ""the kid from 'Slumdog Millionaire.'""John Madden is also quite the veteran, and he brings that extra sensitivity. ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" doesn't slip into some comedy with old-people jokes despite the number of opportunities the script allows for him to do so. Unfortunately, the film is never really all that funny, just funny in that cute ""look at those seniors"" sort of way. Why films like these can't just omit the geriatric humor altogether is a bit dumbfounding, but with the target audience being seniors, perhaps it helps them relate more to the film.It goes without saying that ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" should be required viewing for anyone over 65, but it has some valuable things to say to a younger crowd as well, even if the delivery method has been done to death in other forms.~Steven CThanks for reading!

43,robert-temple-1,Screen magic,10,26 June 2013,"This is a masterpiece of film-making from director John Madden. Just as Pakistan is known (by gastronomes) chiefly for its honey mangoes, so John Madden is known chiefly for his wife Penny, who is just as sweet. But turning to his career, this is 'Madden Mature' and it is a magical and emotional cinematic experience. It is based upon a novel by Deborah Moggach, and is set in Jaipur, India. Only films based upon intricate and slowly-ripened novels can have all of this richness and depth. Ol Parker's screenplay is masterful and it contains many witty and pungent lines of dialogue, so many in fact that it is like 'old times', by which I mean the 1940s, when snappy dialogue was supplied by special writing team members to pepper scripts with witticisms and knock-out one-liners. (How many, if any, of those great lines of dialogue came from the novel I cannot say, never having read it. Somebody should do a study. There's a good Ph.D. subject.) Having a good novel, a good script, and a good director, failure was looking unlikely. And then the cast came! What a collection of fabulous pros, all of them brilliant! A roll call of many of the finest older actors in Britain became a 'role call' as well. (I just had to get that pun in, stimulated by Ol Parker, dontchaknow.) The only person missing is Michael Gambon. Throw all those brilliant actors together and you have an ensemble en suite (this is a film about a hotel, after all). I think that perhaps the most poignant and moving character was the one played by Tom Wilkinson, who achieves closure just before dying. That really was a powerful piece in the complex jigsaw of this multi-layered story. Maggie Smith starts as a foul-mouthed cockney who hurls abuse all round, then softens into a cuddly codger, after telling the tragic tale of how the years of love she lavished on someone else's children was dismissed as 'service', and she was told she was too old and feeble and her services were no longer needed. Her heartache had been the cause of her private internalized Munch 'Scream'. And she tells all this to a girl who cannot understand a word she is saying, an Untouchable, whose whole family have been summoned to honour the English lady because she had done what no higher caste Indian would do, notice her. Judi Dench manages a great deal of pathos in her experience of emotion for Bill Nighy. Bill Nighy perfectly plays the dutiful husband who out of loyalty will not leave a monstrous harridan to whom he is married, played with all the sound and fury of a demon by the irrepressible Penelope Wilton. All of these characters and more have come to the crumbling but beautiful old hotel for elderly foreigners in Jaipur seeking whatever it is they are seeking, and some of them find each other. But we are the luckiest of all, for without even needing to seek, we have found.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
44,BeneCumb,"Not for ""oldies"" only... And cream-of-the-cream of British actors",8,21 December 2012,"The title - The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel - is rather uninviting, but luckily I had heard about some names related to the film and I was sure I would not be disappointed. And I was right, again! The screenplay (based on a strong book, inevitably) is also nice, smoothly running, and has both comic and tragic notes, with serious issues beyond like alienation, loneliness and shallowness. The ending is rather predictable, but still pleasant, as it gives various solutions to the main characters' blunders and hesitations from the past.And what a cast: Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, Ronald Pickup, Penelope Wilton, above all: the best and most famous British 60+ years-of-age performers. Would be fair if some of them wins some major award like Golden Globe or Oscar. The younger actors, especially Dev Patel, are also high-level, probably widening the possible audience.Highly recommendable - and not to seniors only! In my opinion, it would be even more informative and useful for younger viewers, who have retired parents or grandparents.

Both these formidable ladies play to their strengths here,comfortably stealing the film without breaking sweat.
Although messrs Nighy and Pickup deliver their customary performances they are whistling into the wind.

Some find it Iiberating,,others vexing.
There is nothing particularly entertaining or surprising on show but it is unobjectionable,almost soporific in tone.
Quite why ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" has attracted such attention is not obvious to me.
The apparent popularity of ""Bollywood"" to the main stream may account for this fascination,coupled with a jollop of post - colonial guilt .
I can't help feeling that a more accurate picture of the British abroad can be gauged from ""Benidorm"".

46,meeza,The Best? Not Exotic? Not But still a semi-worthy check-in,7,24 December 2013,"""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" was far from being a five-star stay, but I would still mildly recommend for you to check into this picture. Director John Madden illustrates this movie about a group of senior citizens who travel to India for a variety of reasons as a semi- cautionary tale of what can happen if you don't take risks in life. However, Madden was too maddening abrupt and repetitive in presenting that lesson to his viewers. Ol Parker's screenplay had its witty snippets here and there, but it was not the best exotic movie scribe either. The cast was sound though; highlighted by oldies but still goodies Judi Dench as a grieving widow, Bill Nighy as husband stuck in a controlling marriage, Tom Wilkinson as a retired Judge looking for a past love in India, and Maggie Smith as a feisty-racist geriatric who travels to the country for hip replacement surgery. All solid work here but I favor Smith's as the hippest. May critics were enamored with this picture; I am not one of them, even though I am not a real film critic. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" does deserve a visit , but I would have reservations on expecting too much. *** Average",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
47,estebangonzalez10,Marvelous and colorful feel-good movie,8,16 October 2012,"¨Everything will be all right in the end... if it's not all right then it's not the end.¨ There is a scene near the beginning of the film where you have Tom Wilkinson, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, and Maggie Smith all sitting next to each other in the airport. Just to get these talented actors together in one movie is an impressive accomplishment. To take them to the beautiful and colorful India is another. How can you go wrong with such a talented cast? Well we've seen it go wrong in Hollywood with films like Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve, but here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) was able to give each actor enough screen time for their characters to develop and interact with one another. Another difference between those films is that here all the characters are connected with each other and are living under the same roof: the Marigold Hotel. That allows for the film to flow smoothly. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has one weakness in my opinion, which is the title, but the film does work really well as a feel good comedy. It wasn't the kind of film that made me laugh really hard, but it did have me smiling throughout the two hours. The beginning is a little slow since we are introduced to each character individually, but once they are all in the hotel together the film works really well. It moves really smoothly from comedic moments to touching and emotional ones, balancing things out really well; and you will leave the theater with a big smile in your face. It is a wonderful film with a talented cast and an interesting script adapted by Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's novel ¨These Foolish Things.¨ In the very beginning of the film we are introduced to the main characters of the story. On the first hand there is Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench), who recently lost her husband and learns that she has to sell her home due to his debts. Then we are introduced to Judge Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) who decides it is time to retire from his job and move to India. Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) have been married for nearly 40 years and lost their life's savings after lending it to their daughter for a business proposition. Just like Evelyn they are searching for a retiree home that they can afford. Muriel (Maggie Smith) on the other hand is in desperate need of a hip surgery and the hospital gives her the option of having it done in India. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is single in his 70's and is searching for a companion or at least a memorable night. And finally there is Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) who is also searching for a partner after having been divorced multiple times and is tired of living with her daughter and grand children. Each one of these people decides to retire at the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India after being attracted by the ads on internet of such a magical palace. Once they arrive at the hotel they discover that it is nothing like it was on the ads, but sometimes the unexpected things in life are what make it so enjoyable. Dev Patel plays the Hotel manager and he has a love interest, but the true stars are the senior actors.Director John Madden has given us a lesson on how it is possible to make a film with several talented actors and give each one of them character depth. We all know how great Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, and Maggie Smith are, but the rest of the cast was also outstanding. Ronald Pickup had the funnier character and he got the most laughs from me. Celia Imrie was also a delight on screen as well as Penelope Wilton. The film deals with some very interesting issues and I loved the message it got across about being able to adapt to different changes. It is never too late to welcome changes in our lives, and the more willing one is to embrace those changes the better because humans have this special ability to adapt to change, but the problem is that many times we are so comfortable with our lives the way it is that we end up fearing change. Jean Ainslie wasn't willing to adapt to the change in her life and became a bitter person, but Douglas on the other hand began to see things differently when he was willing to embrace life in India. Another issue that arises here has to do with the way society sometimes treats seniors like a sickness instead of finding better ways of life for them. It always seems like an easier solution to send them to some sort of retirement home, but we fail to treat them the way they deserve to be treated. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel teaches us that there is some wisdom in these senior citizens and that it is never too late to adapt to changes. The cast alone is proof of what a magnificent job these seniors can still do.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
48,rooprect,The B-Roll Exotic Marigold Hotel,3,27 September 2019,"In filmmaking, ""B-roll"" refers to supplemental footage shot after the main actors & crew clock out, and it is used as filler to pad the main ""A-Roll"" story. Footage of random people, clouds, traffic, or in extreme cases elephants constitute B-Roll footage, and it is usually set to some bouncy but forgettable song for a few minutes between the real action shots.I don't have the patience to sit with a stopwatch, but I guarantee you that ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is at least 50% B-Roll footage, and that's pretty atrocious. If you watch this movie, be ready with your remote so you can fast forward as soon as you hear the bouncy forgettable song kick in.Why is this so important to mention? It's because it encapsulates the spirit of this entire film. Evidently the producers decided that they can impress us with a bunch of great actors and a ton of B-roll, even though the writing is sub par. Think of every cliche in the book, string them together for 2 hours (sorry, make that 1 hour with 1 hour of B-roll), and there you have the Marigold experience.The story had potential. It's about a bunch of aging expatriates fleeing their native England to live out their twilight years in India. But everything is so horribly juvenile that it reeks of a cheap box office moneymaker. Here are a few of the painful cliches you can expect: tons of bug-eyed, surprised expressions when they realise their accomodations aren't up to Western standards; goofy Indians racing around to please the English gentry in embarrassingly comical ways; a racist Brit (um why the hell would a racist move to India?) who slowly comes around; more bug-eyed surprised looks and vaudeville expressions when they taste the food; and the list goes on.Supplement this with tons, and I mean TONS of B-roll, and you have a movie that is obviously designed to appeal to people who are bored with the Discovery Channel but who lack the patience for real cinema.Highlights: Judi Dench is incredible as always, and it is quite impressive that she can still deliver in a turkey like this. Lowlights: Everything else. This movie is an insult to India and the art of filmmaking.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
49,3xHCCH,A True Gem: Do NOT Let the Title Stop You From Watching,8,20 October 2012,"The title is very corny and uninviting, that is a fact. However, the positive word of mouth about this film is so strong, I simply had to check it out when I saw that it was available on the plane I took going to Los Angeles last week. I have to say, I am very happy to have seen this true gem of a film.I had no idea whatsoever what this was about when I started watching it. The first scene had Judi Dench playing Evelyn, a new widow desperately trying to talk to a call center agent about some investment her late husband made. Then one by one, we get introduced to six other senior British citizen, each with a personal problem of their own, played by other prominent senior British actors, like Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson and Maggie Smith. All seven of these people all decide independently to seek some respite from their present predicaments by booking a stay at the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in Jaipur, India, managed by a struggling young entrepreneur Sonny (Dev Patel) who is also experiencing his own problem with his domineering mother. Here at the hotel, which unfortunately did not look a least bit like its beautifully photo-shopped brochures, these seven seniors undergo life-renewing experiences.It was quite a feat for director John Madden (best known for directing ""Shakespeare in Love"") to tell this story of seven lives with enough depth for the audience to care about their individual stories, not to mention, the story of Sonny who ran the hotel. The treatment was light and pleasant, despite the serious topics, with enough British dry wit and humor (especially from the ever-delightful Maggie Smith) to keep the audience fully entertained. Despite how the synopsis goes, his story about senior citizens surprisingly did not bore me at all. I wanted to see what happens to all of them at the end, and so will you. Do not miss this one.

50,EUyeshima,Distinguished Veteran Cast Handle Late Game Changes in Faraway India,8,17 May 2012,"Exotic locations and old-fashioned storytelling conventions are nothing revolutionary at the movies, but when executed with professionalism and an abundant heart, it can make for charming entertainment. This is exactly what happens under the reins of director John Madden (""Shakespeare in Love"") with this whimsical 2012 dramedy that brings together a sterling cast of accomplished British veterans to play seniors who choose to ""outsource"" their retirement in India's colorfully mythical Rajasthan region. What they discover upon their arrival is a decrepit hotel run by an irrepressible young owner appropriately named Sonny. Optimistic to a buoyant extreme, he tries to gloss over the hotel's numerous shortcomings with a mix of responses from his rather addled guests, and their individual transitions into the local culture is what makes up their narrative adapted by screenwriter Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's 2004 novel, ""These Foolish Things"".The group of seven strangers who turn up on the steps of the Marigold Hotel is led by Evelyn, a recent widow who finds she has been saddled with her husband's seemingly insurmountable debts. Through her blog, she provides the film's central voice as she identifies her tentative steps toward not only assimilation into the Indian way of life but her own personal emancipation. Graham is a high-court judge who chooses early retirement in order to find the love of his youthful ardor when he lived in Jaipur as a boy. There's Muriel, an irascible spinster who is looking for a cheap hip replacement and plans to go back to England given her acute xenophobia. An unhappily married couple, Douglas and Jean, have come to the Marigold because they can't otherwise afford a retirement residence that meets her material needs. And then there are two singles both looking for mates in a new locale – saucy Madge who pretends to be Princess Margaret to gain entry into an exclusive club and incorrigible Norman who catches the eye of a lonely widow.Sonny has his own issues as he faces stern maternal protest to his efforts to save the family hotel and marry the fetching girl he loves, an employee at a local call center. Needless to say, each character figures out what to do to work through their challenges as their lives change in the process. The cast is unsurprisingly excellent even though some of the characters are rather sketchily developed. Judi Dench lends her particular gravitas to Evelyn as she evolves from fearful to empowered due to her fulfilling job as a cultural instructor at the call center. Tom Wilkinson makes Graham's journey to India a genuinely poignant one with an unexpected denouement. Maggie Smith steals scenes easily as Muriel, although I have to admit I found her changed attitude the most incredulous to accept. Bill Nighy plays put-upon Douglas with charming vulnerability, while Penelope Wilton has the unenviable task of playing the shrewish, frightened Jean with conviction.In roles originally slated for Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole (how lovely it would have been to see such cinema icons in this film), Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup provide a nice blend of impudence and optimism to Madge and Norman. Bringing youthful vigor to their lives is Dev Patel in his first major role since ""Slumdog Millionaire"", and he brings a welcome comic ebullience to the proceedings as Sonny. Despite the creakiness of some of the plot devices, Madden keeps the pacing nimble enough so that no one character's arc dominates the tone of the film, which is crucial in reinforcing the message of hope he and Parker are conveying within the context of retirement and old age, that indeed life can get better with the proper attitude. Particular kudos need to be given to cinematographer Ben Davis (""The Debt"") who captures the teeming life and colorful splendor of Jaipur and Udaipur. This is not a film for the Avengers fanboys, but clearly the appeal of the distinguished cast and exotic locales has a clear target audience.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
51,aharmas,How do you handle life?,9,20 May 2012,"For starters, let's just this another amazing British dramedy. There are enough emotions here to propel a few independent stories; instead, with the help a very talented group of performers the story lines all converge in a rather special place, and well, maybe a little too neatly, things might come to an end that will please most of the audience.Leading the pack is Judy Dench, a reliable performer who represents everyone of the characters, a group of people who get to their retirement age and must question whether they really know what the next step will be when they suddenly realize they might not even know who they or their partners truly are.Arriving in India is an amusing and painful enterprise for most of the different characters, a place that promised support and comfort but delivers a few surprises of its own. Throughout most of the film there is a sense of disappointment, regret, discovery, and hopefully resolution. The stories are all interesting and might find us relating to at least one of them. Who hasn't had their dreams crushed unexpectedly or who doesn't hope that there still might be hope at the end of the road. Is it easier to live with lies and lack of confidence, or to take one more chance? Some might think the film is not realistic enough. Life might not be that simple; however what the film tries to tell us is exactly that. Life can be as complicated as we make it, and there will be times when we won't be able to change it to our satisfaction, so we at least ""must try"", and that will somehow get us closer to the answer. There might not be perfection here, but there is plenty of heart and hope, and isn't that why we like this kind of movies?",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It's very clearly aiming for an older audience and does so with a very British cast. That's awesome, seriously. We're inundated with YA adventures, kids movies and adolescent dramas so it's legitimately nice to see a film aiming at an oft underserved group. Unfortunately, what makes it great also makes it very hard for me to really connect to the material.This is a good movie, quite possibly a great movie for the right audience.

It's off to exotic India they go, under the guise of a luxurious getaway called the newly restored Marigold Hotel. Of course, it is far from restored or new, and even further from the grandeur and splendor as advertised. Cope they will and learn a few life lessons on their journey to self-enlightenment. Ay wot, well, Kippered Herring and Hare Krishna to all! Directed with style by John Madden, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel takes that tired formula of strangers in a strange land who will undergo a personal metamorphosis because of the new experiences and customs they will discover. It cleverly tweaks the premise with a dash of droll British humor and dollops of fun. The results are quite entertaining, if somewhat predictable.Of course, if one is making a wry romantic comedy with the geriatric crowd in mind, it certainly doesn't hurt to have assembled such fine veteran actors like Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith ( no one does disdain and snobbery better than our Maggie ), Tom Wilkinson, and dear Judi Dench ( no one embodies grace and class better than Dame Dench ). These accomplished thespians deliver their lines with flair and create instantly relatable characters that any moviegoers, young or old, can thoroughly embrace and appreciate. It is so easy to delight in the antics of these elderly coots, eccentrics, and kooks as they adapt to the squalor and unpleasantness of their newly-acquired surroundings, as they become immersed in the Indian culture. It's obviously a win-win situation for the audience to watch the characters adjust to their losing situation with a modicum of refinement and verve.Also on-board to give solid support are great character actors like Ronald Pickup, Penelope Wilton, and Celia Imrie. Dev Patel and Tena Desae round out the cast as the young lovers who share in the karma and camaraderie that surrounds the natives and the foreigners.The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel isn't great drama or even laugh-out-loud comedy. It never strives to be. But it is a delightful British comedy of manners that uses its amusing off-beat characters, their preconceived notions, and their irascible dilemmas with the best of its wry sense of humor.

54,eric262003,British Acting At Its Finest With Excellent Locations,9,2 July 2017,"A group of elderly British people redistribute their retirement funds and settle in the more frugal, but exotic location in Jaipur, India. Under very convincing circumstances through the advertising, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel guarantees you you live like you were in paradise. However, when these elderly people arrive, the Hotel was anything but what the adverts said even though the owner Sonny (Dev Patel) provides optimism and great hospitality to these retirees. And though they were not given the paradise they were expecting, they soon start to garner life-changing experiences.There are several themes to ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" which include follow your destinies, accept the changes in your life and memorizing famous quotes from Kipling are some of the many features to this funny, sometimes sad but mostly optimistic tale situated in the heart of the vibrant colourful landscapes of India. Based off of a novel by Deborah Moggach, ""These Foolish Things"", the lives of these elderly people are brought into an atmosphere that spells opportunity even if they have to go through some stages in their lives that are not always flattering. The gears of the story shift around taking risks and earning the love as each character must go through on their journey in which secrets come out, self-esteem comes with a price and acceptance is a must. It's an engaging film with subtle humour as it cools the heated climate as each patron goes on their initiative to search for happiness.In the early scenes, we are introduced to the characters who find each other as they all check into India's Best Exotic Marigold Hotel where everything looks exquisite and luxurious and run by an energetic hotel manager Sonny (Dev Patel). We have housewife Evelyn Greenslade (Judy Dench) who had to sell her home to pay off her late husband's debts and serves as a narrator throughout the film. Former judge Hon. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) decides to finally retire in a country where he spent his first 18 years there. Then you have the eternally arguing married couple Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) who don't have much money going for them because of Doug's investing went towards their daughter's internet business. Then you have bigoted Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith) who needs inexpensive hip replacement surgery pronto. Then there's Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) wants to look for another man and want to escape her daughter's wraith of acting like a free babysitter. And finally Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) who denies his age and has a lust for younger women seeks India for a better catch.Trouble wastes no time here as the seven of them wind up on a crammed bus after the pick-up bus from the airport never arrives and their luggage gets thrown over carelessly. To makes matters worse, the hotel the guarantees luxury and splendor is anything but. It's dusty, condemned, infested with cockroaches and phones that don't operate. But the cheery Sonny promises everything is going to be fine which in subliminal terms means no everything is bad, but it's not the end of the line and that Kipling's quote that even disasters can have its hidden triumphs if you think with the glass half full.The guests each have provocative contrary looks and opinions about their surroundings. Graham who has more experience about India has his mindset on something extraordinary. Muriel feels she's in the threshold of hell and while Joan feels this place is a dump and is quite vocal about it. Smith has a ball with those witty one-liners she delivers and with ease especially with the news that her hip surgery is in six months. Jean complains about the hotel which gives Douglas the chance to embrace the smiling youngsters while visiting the ancient temples. And while Evelyn adjusts to her new surroundings, Madge and Norman are out soul-searching on their own.What makes this story stand out is that just when we think that the guests have gotten their lives planned out for them, director John Madden pulls a fast one on us. The cinematography is quite realistic as we explore the richness of Indian culture and the bustling of the city streets. We can feel the steamy air in our nostrils and the markets and stands are providing us with intricate colours and gorgeous flowers blossom wherever you go. You can sense the aura of India as you travel the city by walking or by a rickshaw as you see peddlers, skinny cows and heavy traffic in the downtown core.Every performer was excellent in their respected roles, especially from Dench, Nighy and Wilkinson and Patel was remarkable as a hotel manager who is in love with a pretty lady named Sunaina (Tena Dusae). The most memorable scene takes place at the call centre's stairwell where he displays his true feelings to her is funny. There's a nice balance of lightly done scenes and the more sentimental ones. Though it's for a mature audience, a little humour an inquisitive mind and bit of soul you'll find this film very enjoyable.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
55,stensson,India on old minds,6,30 June 2012,"Also elderly care is of course outsourced to Asia and it happens to some more or less stiff-lipped people from Britain. Some of them are prepared and get on well. Some are prepared and don't, while some refuse to be prepared.This is feelgood and the script has few surprises. We laugh at India and we laugh at the British for old known reasons. The acting is however on most hands splendid, bringing life to the familiar stereotypes.But this comedy is of course so very much on Western conditions. One can really wonder if our ideas about the exotic East will ever be outsourced. It's hardly to be expected.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
56,intelearts,507th Review: Good sturdy comedy but lacks any bite,6,25 June 2012,"Marigold is entertaining in a very British sort of way - it's characters are all a little repressed and class ridden to start with but by the end have discovered something more about themselves. It has a charm to it but is let down by a flaccid script, and weak direction - and a general sense of unease that this is some sort of post-colonial wish fulfillment - so we end up with a film that wants to be both a drama and a drama comedy and by doing so lacks all bite and spice.It is a perfect airplane movie, you can sit back and relax and enjoy it, but it really has almost nothing meaningful to say - this is not necessarily a bad thing - as a light frothy piece about retirement as an adventure it is all rather jolly - and the cast do bring verve and energy to it - it just seems to meander and wander and it would be kind to say the characters are essentially caricatures who, even with some backstory, are never more than wispy at best.And perhaps this is the charm, Marigold is escapism, and a chance to fantasize about what life might be like. All in all, it will appeal to those who like their comedy safe and enjoy a fanciful tale well spun, but it is too lightweight to be anything other than instantly forgettable.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
57,Howlin Wolf,"Not exactly the 'Best', but a comfortable stay, at the very least... !",7,8 March 2012,"For the first twenty minutes or so, it feels like it's pandering slightly to the naive person's view of senior life and attitudes. Once the film establishes itself and reaches the location where the story will play out, however, we get some lovely poignant backstories for the characters. The performances of Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson in particular are magnificent. The same feeling of things being a little too neat applies to the climax, also - the Dev Patel character's experience of the wisdom of advancing years seems not only inconsistent, but also provides a conveniently pat resolution. Overall though, it's a good humoured film that should leave you smiling.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
58,ketgup83,A marvelous film in every context with brave and impressive performances.,7,2 July 2012,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was a nice dramedy which had a very great storyline coupled with wonderful performances by the veteran actors.Evelyn(Judi Dench) Is a divorcée who lost her husband recently and want to clear off her husband's huge debt as early as possible, Grasham (Tom Wilkinson) is a gay who is retired and still not happy after his retirement , Douglas and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) are married couples who are going through rocky phase in their marriage , Norman (Ronald pickup) is single, old broken man who still young at heart and Muriel is seeking a company of filthy rich guy. Different people with different stories meet at broken , mediocre , filthy yet described as ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in Jaipur. They are unhappy with what was promised to them over them over an advertisement about the hotel but still are fascinated by its unique and authentic charm.Based on a novel of same name by Deborah Moggach , ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel "" entertains you right from the beginning where every person meets at the hotel till the end. John Madden has perfectly chosen each actor playing their part to T. Each actor has different story to tell which makes it more engrossing and compelling. Direction is impressive with few scenes standing out like the one where Grasham tells his reason of coming to India, Jamal explaining the pretentious glamour the hotel . Screenplay keeps you engrossed in the film that you would not realize when the film ends. Cinematography is eye-catching where the setting of India is the reason I was disappointed little bit. How many have we seen India in poor light by Hollywood ? This is probably some tenth movie which I have seen after Slumdog millionaire and The Avengers. However , the stupendous performance by the leading actors is what it makes it stand out. It is difficult is tell who were the best as I felt that everyone did justice to their part but I guess it is Dev Patel who was really impressive as young chap trying to save his ancestor property and impress his girlfriend. Judi Dench was as usual superb along with Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson.A marvelous film in every context with brave and impressive performances. This one is sure to be enjoyed with your family.

59,proud_luddite,Enjoyable British Wit,7,3 November 2020,"Seven British pensioners move to the title hotel in Jaipur, India for various reasons. Once they arrive, things are not as they had expected.Firstly, the flaws: there are elements in the film's conclusion that are predictable and can be seen at least a mile away. Also, the film begins well in a subplot involving a gay character showing rare sensitivity. Then it falls into an unfortunate cliché that has plagued gay characters in films for decades.However, the joys of the film make it very much worth recommending.With seven experienced British actors (plus Dev Patel of ""Slumdog Millionaire""), the performances are the film's greatest strength. They add oomph to some wonderfully, witty lines in the film's screenplay. Some of the better parts of the end include some life lessons narrated by characters played by the wonderful likes of Maggie Smith and Judi Dench. This leaves viewers coming out of the theatre with a genuinely warm feeling.Add to the mix the beautiful setting of Jaipur and a subplot about a lower-caste family and it's easy to see why this film was such a box-office hit. - dbamateurcritic",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
60,thekarmicnomad,"Warm, quaint,predictable, excellent.",8,1 July 2012,"By the time the host of worn stereotyped characters shuffled onto the screen (about ten minutes in) you will know exactly how this movie is going to play out. This however did not spoil my enjoyment of the film.The high calibre cast carry this whimsical film with ease. I have strong respect for the writer and director for sticking to the direction of the film and not throwing in some quirky twist or outrageously morale point on society.If you are a cynical person (be honest) the later half of the film is going to make you gag as the plot reaches its inevitable sunny conclusion. The film is a little sickly in places but for a Sunday afternoon it is excellent, grin-inducing fodder.This is a gentle massage for the sentimental parts of your psyche, don't expect thrills or engaging plot and you'll have an enjoyable, relaxing view.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
61,vitaleralphlouis,Gay Agenda Sinks Just OK Inde Film,3,22 May 2012,"There was much to enjoy about Exotic Marigold. The location filming in Jaipur, India; as well as the anticipation of an adult-themed movie in the era of pyrotech boredom. I'm of the age now to relate to a movie about senior citizens. I think most seniors are more interesting than the characters in this movie. I think the script was wise-alec to a fault, and when we were in India we never encountered either cockroaches or bad food. Still, the film could have been a winner.I did not relate at all to the Judge's moaning about his long lost boy friend, now married to a woman (eeegad!) The film's gay theme added absolutely nothing and the producers lack the courage of conviction whenever they conceal a gay theme from the public until AFTER you buy your ticket. No doubt some readers won't like this part of my review. They'd prefer to whisper something nasty and silence my view. Tell you what: Most people do not like ""agendas"" inflicted on them in movies.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
62,rps-2,Thoroughly wonderful movie!,9,8 March 2013,"Even if this was a bad film, it still would be worth watching just to see Maggie Smith and Judi Dench together. But it is a great film! Part comedy, part tearjerker, part travelogue, part drama, part soap opera, part fairy tale, it all comes together beautifully. The exotic bustle of India is well captured with a fast, busy camera technique. Yet there also are many measured scenes and some very effective closeups. The cast, both British and Indian, is first rate. Without giving away the ending, I wonder if it perhaps was a setup for a sequel. I hope so because this was one of the most enjoyable and rewarding films I have seen in the last year.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
63,cultfilmfan,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,7,7 June 2012,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is based on the novel These Foolish Things by Deborah Moggach. The film tells the story of several elderly British residents who each having individual reasons, decide to go and live in a hotel in India. None of them have ever met before, but seeing as they are all staying at this one hotel they start to bond and become quite friendly with one another and also learn about what brought each of them to this foreign destination. There were things that I did like about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, but if I have to be completely honest about it, I would have to say that it didn't quite win me over and there were a few things that I did have some problems with. Mainly my problems would stem from the script. I say script because I have never read the novel that the film is based on, or know how closely the film follows that novel. I think my main problem was that I did not think the level of character development in the film was as good as it should have been and because of that I had trouble not only relating to these characters, or really feeling anything genuine for them. We do learn some things about them during the duration of the film, but even though it is not an especially short film, I felt that a lot of the characterization was rushed and seemed to jump to several different plot lines and events before the previous ones were ended, or wrapped up in a satisfactory manner. I think these characters could have been really interesting and I probably could have bonded, or cared for them more if the film had devoted more time to them and perhaps not rushed things so much as to get all these other subplots into the film. I think that the main intention of the film was to have us bond and care for these characters and laugh, cry and genuinely feel and enjoy our time together with them, but because I could not identify, or connect with them on more of a personal, or substantial level, I would have to say that the main goal, or plot of the film was lost on me and so a lot of it, for me at least, did not work. That being said, there were still things I did like about the film. The acting by the entire cast was all very good, I just wish these actors had more to work with and do with their characters because they are all very good actors and do play the roles well, but had the film gone in a different direction and allowed us into their psyches and more on a personal level I could have seen the film being a lot more interesting and also allowing much more passionate and Oscar worthy performances from the actors. Nevertheless the acting is still good here. There is also several humorous moments in the film that are played out quite well and I enjoyed those. A lot of the humour comes from actor Dev Patel, who plays Sonny Kapoor, who more, or less steals the show and makes the film a lot more enjoyable than it is. Some of the traditional and other shots of India, were quite something to behold and I enjoyed watching seeing about how others are living in a culture very unlike my own. There were certainly uplifting and pleasant moments about The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and it is not like I left the theatre completely unrewarded, I just left wanting more and not totally having my fill, or being adequately satisfied with what I just saw. On the other hand, the film seems to be a hit with audiences and is doing quite well in it's now expanded limited release and I know that there are many others who will probably like it a lot as well. For me though it left something to be desired and worked on and wasn't to my absolute satisfaction.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
64,Quietb-1,The flower starts to wilt,6,4 May 2012,"Seven Brits head to a retirement hotel in India. The names appear on the screen but don't worry there's not a quiz. Maybe seven was the correct number for the book but the movie is too long and some of the characters don't seem to get the attention they deserve.Judi Dentch gets the most attention and seems to be all knowing. She voice-overs the back story of some character including their thoughts and motivations like she read the book. It becomes annoying when she labels days by numbers. By the time it's day fifty one, does it matter if it was day thirty five or forty two? It's just chatter.Chatter is the problem with the movie. Too many scenes are dialogue driven with one character listening to another characters story. On at least one occasion we see a scene and then the character sits down and tells another character what we just saw. In one case a character describes his visit to a smelly temple, don't talk about it, it's a movie, show it.The best scene wasn't ruined by dialogue. Two ""old friends"" hug and we know what they have shared in the past, and that there is joy and forgiveness.Serviceable performances all around. Nobody breaks a sweat. The music track often becomes loud and distracting. ""Ederly and beautiful"" is dropped from the title in all promotion. The TV spot says ""like the coast of Florida"" the movie says ""Costa Brava"". Beautiful photography and interesting India locations may be worth the price of a matinée admission.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

The predictable resolution of the conflicts of the plotlines is really what brings this down. As if the clichés and melodrama that pervade the entire film weren't enough!

66,JohnRayPeterson,The cast makes a good story that much better,8,25 September 2012,"The movie has a truly wonderful cast; I would have watched it no matter what the story was. Thankfully, the story turned out to be absolutely delightful. Young audiences may not be moved by the story of English elderlies shuffling away to India for their retirement, granted; but the diverse characters and each of their personal reasons for expatriating themselves to a daunting country is a gold mine for character development. This movie will make you pause and reflect on the plight of seniors and also on what a shock retirement is to some. What you make of your time on the blue planet is all important and determines how pleasant or not one's retirement can become. The mantra ""It'll all work out in the end"" is so well conveyed throughout the movie by Dev Patel (of fame TV series The Newsroom), that it's inspirational; you may well adopt that philosophy by the time the movie ends. I have and am happier for it. Take a glance at the cast, read the synopsis and a few reviews; if my recommending the movie is not a factor, then maybe some other reviewers will sway you to watch it.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
67,Likes_Ninjas90,Postures as a 'fish out of water' movie but surprises us with its sensitivity and appreciation for characters instead of broad personalities,8,24 March 2012,"A group of elderly British men and women travel to India together to stay in the Marigold Hotel. Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a widow who has never had a job of her own and is looking for employment overseas to pay off her husband's debts. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) is a judge who has retired and is looking for someone he once knew in India. Douglas (Bill Nighy) and his stubborn wife Jean (Penelope Wilton) have moved overseas because they are dissatisfied with the residency they've been put into after losing their money. Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) are both looking for love but he strongly prefers the younger options. Muriel (Maggie Smith) is a former housekeeper and racist in need of a hip operation. The hotel they are staying in is falling apart, buoyed only by the enthusiasm of its owner Sonny (Dev Patel), who is trying to court a girl working in a call centre, much to the disapproval of his mother. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel postures as a 'fish out of water' movie but surprises us with its sensitivity and appreciation for characters instead of broad personalities. Initially it seems as though these will be caricatures and familiar archetypes but growth is provided in sensible, mature scenes that ensures that the film does not have to resort to no-brainer slapstick or obvious humour to be engaging. The film cleverly aligns us with the expectations of the characters and then subverts them for both parties. Various relationships are not sown back together in the end and some seemingly predictable romances do not blossom like we've been conditioned to think that they will. Instead, the main characters are all collectively linked by their age and a feeling of redundancy in life. There are intelligent scenes, like the one where Evelyn gives a demonstration in a call centre to show her social experiences, which restore each of the characters feelings of self-worth. We're told intelligently and optimistically that: ""Everything will be alright in the end and if it's not, it's not the end"". What's equally pleasing about the screenplay is the way that it reveals character backstories, through the dialogue, so that we can sympathise with almost everyone in the film and in fresh ways too. Perhaps the richest of these is Tom Wilkinson's Graham, who grew up in India as a child and has a secret that is actually quite affecting. When he returns to an area that he thought he knew he discovers that many of the houses have now been removed. It's a metaphor for his disconnection but also the limitations of his lifespan too. Arguably, if this was a Hollywood film I don't think we would have these kinds of poignant details. Aside from its humanity, the film is also strikingly funny thanks to the deft British wit that is frequently hilariously and ironic. When Douglas' prudish wife says that she doesn't know how they're going to celebrate their 40th anniversary, another character chimes in to say: ""Perhaps a moments silence?"" The entire cast, some of which are given some fairly unglamorous roles, are smart and charismatic. Even Dev Petal, who at first seems like a token Indian stereotype, develops his role into someone battling feelings and desires against personal conflict. India itself is another great character in the story. As you would expect, filming on location means that we fully obtain the country's vibrancy, colour and people, with crowds of bodies constantly in motion on screen. Although on the outskirts the film might seem like a light, breezy comedy, I think people are going to surprised by how much attention has been given to the humanity as much as the jokes. The writing is that impressive.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
68,MattyGibbs,Enjoyable,7,5 January 2013,This is a story of a bunch of pensioners who retire to what they believe is a luxurious hotel in India. It follows their stories as they come to terms with their unfamiliar new surroundings. This film boasts an extremely talented veteran British cast who all shine as you would expect. The real star of the film for me however is Dev Patel who steals the film as the charming and funny young Indian hotel owner. There are plenty of laughs to be had throughout this film and he delivers a fair proportion of them. The film is fairly predictable but with a great cast and a wonderful setting this charming film more than makes up for this.

In fact it was actually very brilliant. The main characters lives became intertwined seamlessly and each had their own individual perspective on life. A greater more talented British cast I have not seen. When they were all thrust together through circumstance they morphed into one well-rounded personality with the ability to develop into content adults. Maggie Smith and Judi Dench were particularly fantastic.While the cast of characters carry the movie the absolutely stunning backdrop of India sends it over the top. The vibrancy of the setting creates a fun and lively adventure for the viewer.

A group of British senior citizens, who are all at a crossroads in life, move to India, to stay at what appears to be the greatest resort India has to offer, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, until they actually get there and realize that the future is never what you think it will be. The true joy of this film is seeing the perennial who's who of British actors play off of one another, from the exemplary Judi Dench, who anchors the entire movie, to Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, and Bill Nighy, all in tip top shape. The film is charming because of these actors' performances, and it's what makes this film worth watching. By having to juggle so many characters and story lines, director John Madden has his hands full and does more than a capable job, taking enough time with each character to flesh out their stories. While The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is not a groundbreaking film that will have you singing its praises for years to come, it's moving and highly enjoyable, with a smile on your face at the end that cannot be wiped away.

They bring a good deal of baggage with them when they make this extraordinary move. Some of them carry very heavy baggage indeed.This movie is very much about India, and about the lives of the Indians running the hotel, and to a certain extent about the enduring relationship between the UK and India.

A few of the seniors find their heaven, their new life, in this strange and exotic place; others fail to adapt.Like Quartet, the message for moviegoers is to fill your life with new experiences, love, friends, colour and travel. Do not let retirement and growing old destroy your spirit.Younger film fans may not see much in a movie like this. Anyone about 45 years old or older will love it, I'm sure.

72,rubenm,A feel-good movie in the best tradition,7,31 March 2012,"An intelligent script, a top-notch cast and a beautiful location. That's all it takes to make fine movies like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. The story is about a group of senior citizens who, for various reasons, decide to spend some of their last years in India. They end up in the Marigold Hotel, run by a young owner who tries everything to improve his run-down hotel. The reason why each hotel guest has decided to travel to India is shown in short, efficient scenes before the opening credits. When the story evolves, we not only see different hilarious situations, as you may expect from elderly British people dropped in the chaotic Indian society, but we also see the changes that India brings about in each of them. So, as in any good story, in the end each of the lead characters has changed. One has found love, others have decided to end their marriage. One has changed from a bitter racist to a helpful and positive person. Another has come to grips with the loss of her husband. And one has died - but only after having met the person he has longed for during many years. All these stories are woven together to form a nice ensemble film. With an extra part for the beautiful scenery of Rajasthan. One could argue that this movie is more about the British than about the Indian society. Apart from the theme of arranged marriages, there is not much about India in the movie. In this respect, it is quite different from the other British-made Indian movie Slumdog Millionaire, which didn't shy away from the slums, the poverty and the cruelty in the Indian society. In The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, even the poor dalit woman, who sweeps the floor of the hotel, has a pretty face and is dressed in beautiful and colourful clothes. But that is not essential. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a feel-good film in the best tradition. It's warm, light-hearted and at the same time not meaningless.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
73,christophe92300,Average,5,5 October 2012,"Though the cast is first class and minimizes the damage, this movie is full of clichés, overused (comic) situations, simplistic psychology and script unfolding. It contains too many story lines, which aren't fully developed: you learn a bit about everyone but nothing is deep enough. Same goes for the characters, who are caricatural and lack substance; Dev Patel's is particularly annoying. TBEMH also irritates because of its convenience and its omnipresent feel-good vibe. However, there are some good lines and scenes, especially during the first hour and, albeit lengthy at moments, this film manages to get the average grade.

74,TheSquiss,"I want to be old, I want to be poor and I want to retire to India NOW!",8,17 June 2012,"I loved The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and I'm not ashamed to admit it. What's not to like? Well, okay, at times it's a little predictable, the premise is wholly unlikely and certain aspects tie up too neatly, but then Shakespeare built a 400 year (and counting) career on such plots and it didn't do him any harm. More recently the same can be said of Billy Elliot, Notting Hill, The Lord of the Rings trilogy I'm sure you catch my drift. It loses one star for that but I'm not going to knock it.It's directed by Jon Madden, who helmed Mrs Brown, Shakespeare in Love and The Debt (we'll gloss over the literary mutilation that was Captain Corelli's Mandolin) and he's reunited here with the star of two of those films, Judi Dench. Not content with casting one of the finest actresses of any generation, he's gathered an impressive who's who of acting aristocracy: Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, Tom Wilkinson, Celia Imrie, Ronald Pickup and topped it up with Slumdog Millionaire's Dev Patel.For various reasons surrounding diminished wealth, health and happiness, seven British wrinklies decamp to India to retire and recuperate at the eponymous hotel. Unfortunately it doesn't quite resemble the brochure, lacking phones, doors, rooms They are thrown together in an experience that challenges their prejudices, makes them reevaluate their lives and, in certain instances, takes them so far out of their comfort zones that all manner of emotions tumble out of them. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a film about dismantling and building relationships and learning new things about old selves. It's often funny, frequently touching, occasionally frustrating, constantly inspirational and thoroughly uplifting.One minor plot line is left unresolved (for me, at least) but the film doesn't end. It simply closes a chapter and so there is great hope. It may not be the greatest film ever but it has its place in the world and will probably earn a space on my DVD shelf. It is beautiful in many ways; the nuances of lesser characters, the touching honesty of principals and the simple, humorous and occasionally poignant dialogue all bring colour and light to the 124 minutes you'll spend in the company of this film.Beyond all that is delightfully scripted, the overwhelming beauty that floods through the film is the location. The decaying, crumbling ornate temples are magnificent on their own but the striking saris, the vivid blossoms and the heartwarming smiles rekindled memories of my own, all too brief and all too distant experiences of India. I recalled every sight, sound and smell and my mouth watered in recollection of the exquisite meals I ate in dusty cafes and vibrant streets and I wished throughout the film, on my drive home and in several dreams to experience, again, feeling alive in India and perhaps living there.I want to be old, I want to be poor and I want to retire to India right NOW!

75,davidgee,Tea without Mussolini,8,7 March 2012,"Take a cast of elderly British acting stalwarts and transport them to a photogenic foreign location and what you get is TEA WITH MUSSOLINI or, in this case, THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. Both films are a pleasure to sit through, but where MUSSOLINI had OTT stellar acting - and Cher's to-die-for wardrobe - MARIGOLD has lower-key performances - and clothes from Primark.Only Judi Dench (who is hard-up) and Tom Wilkinson (playing gay) are given a tiny amount of plot development. Maggie Smith, wheelchair-bound, gets to do a working-class accent for a change although, like her Downton dowager, she turns out to have a card or two up her sleeve. Ronald Pickup has the Leslie Phillips role of the ageing lothario with Celia Imrie as his matchmaker, a non-singing Dolly Levi. Penelope Wilton drew the short straw and plays a middle-class Mona Lott oblivious to the charms of Jaipur; Bill Nighy is her put-upon husband, reminiscent of Hyacinth Bucket's poor Richard. Former Slumdog Millionaire Dev Patel is the cash-strapped manager of the Marigold Hotel; he shouts rather than speaks and looks like his Asian babe girlfriend's kid brother.Despite Penny Wilton's moaning about the squalor of India, we are only shown a city that is chaotic and colourful - even the beggars are happy and smiling: no mutilated amputees here. There's a handful of crisp one-liners, a couple of farcical highlights and one moment of poignancy, but overall this is a big-screen cross between a sitcom and a Carry-On. Somehow MARIGOLD HOTEL is greater than the sum of its parts. It's not going to resonate the way TEA WITH MUSSOLINI does, but - I'll say it again - it's a pleasure, almost a joy, to sit through.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
76,jordan2240,Fine piece of film-making for adults,8,30 May 2012,"This was one of those rare instances where a film lived up to the expectations set in the previews. Saw it with my parents (in their 70s, wife (both of us in our 50s), sister (again in the 50s), and son (young 20s), and other than my wife, who had trouble concentrating on it because the air conditioning was out in the theater, we all enjoyed the film. Given the characters were primarily around the age of my parents, I think they especially enjoyed the message that one can still find fulfillment at that age.Each character was developed beautifully, and given just enough attention, and you really get a feel for the environment they are in in India, and how they react to it. The drama and the comedy is expertly interspersed.In addition to the acting and cinematography, I also greatly enjoyed the soundtrack. All in all, a great movie-going experience. Seeing it in an older, single-screen theater where they still open a curtain to start the picture only added to the enjoyment. I do prefer the modern touch of AC though.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
77,diane-34,"A superb, life-expansive peek into maturation and new paths.",10,19 April 2012,"I know that movies, American ones at least, must have action and or animated humans and or animals using the voices of actors. I have never attended any of them accept one but unfortunately I must sit through their interminable previews before I can watch a real movie but thank the fates for foreign films which dare to break the suffocating Hollywood mold. Marigold Hotel is one of those movies that dares to break the mold; one of those movies that is probably destined for a short run even though the actors are, to a person, superb.At our viewing last night, I noticed a number of Indian women in saris with their families come in the theatre and as the film progressed their laughter at certain parts of the film was unmistakable from where they were sitting as well as the fact that the Anglo audience was not laughing at the same parts. Those parts were particularly when the English ladies were having difficulty dealing with particular aspects of life in very different and very crowded India.As I wrote the movie was extremely well acted and well directed. The English actor's parts were parts taken by veteran actors, all readily identifiable, and were superb and I certainly will not be as bold as to identify any particular one as being superior to the others; I can only say that they melded seamlessly. If I were to select a memorable character, Dev Patel is the one that comes immediately to mind. He is immediately appreciated as the young hotel owner, manager, desk clerk and concierge. His use, and misuse, of the English language immediately endears him to anyone who has travelled and tried to use other languages themselves.Make every effort to see this wonderful, life-promoting film.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

In The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel the Marigold Hotel is an oasis for the ideal retirement community in the lush richness of India. These souls are seeking adventure and a new lease in life as they enter life's third act. A remarkable cast that includes Judi Dench as Evelyn, a recent widow discovering her own wings and seeks adventure. The cinematography is spectacular as you are transformed to the exotic sights and sounds of India. The story follows several unlikely individuals that are brought together at the Marigold Hotel, each on their own odyssey. One noted quote from Sonny (Dev Patel) throughout the movie is that ""everything will be all right in the end if it's not all right then it's not the end"", wise words to live by and celebrate life's adventures.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
79,bbewnylorac,Unexpectedly good,7,5 September 2015,"On paper, this film looks terribly clichéd. A group of elderly Brits have a jolly adventure in India alongside a group of eccentric Indians. But I stumbled on to it on TV and found that it was far better than the trailer made out. The cinematography and costume design are utterly beautiful, making use if the vibrant colours of street life and fashion against dusty street backdrops. The script strives to be romantic and heartfelt without being soppy, and best of all, the filmmakers avoid the trap of trying too hard to be funny. The Indian and the British cast, similarly, take their jobs seriously, and do an excellent job. It's so refreshing that all the elderly characters get genuine story arcs, and are not just sidelines of the main storyline, or comic relief. The script gives just the right balance of light and shade. The Indian music is understated but evocative. Overall a good film.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
80,AvidClimber,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel — See something different, exotic, and charming",9,14 March 2013,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a charming and lovely movie about retired people choosing India as their country of choice. A bit of romance, a lot of adventure.The setting is beautiful, enticing, and exotic. The characters are diverse, without being eclectic, and very interesting. The story is captivating, filled with nice details and relatively quick paced but with enough meat and sufficient time to digest.Dev Patel dances a fine line as the owner-manager of the hotel. At first, he's kind of annoying, bumbling mistakes and inefficiency, but he quickly becomes charmingly adorable. Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, and Tom Wilkinson are assuredly the star performers, however, it would be unfair not to mention that the rest of cast also delivered great performances.Unless you find the subject boring, I highly recommend it.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
81,willcundallreview,Indian adventure that drags just a little,6,18 March 2015,"Rating-6/10The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a big film, and not only because it is set in the humongous country of India, but that also that it managed to gross hundreds of millions with such a basic story. It isn't new, it isn't refreshing but it still manages to please, with it's humorous older cast who cast off the shackles of well, age, this is just all round fun and even though it can be slow at times and could be said to be just a little over long, it still manages to be good fun and a nice ride too.Now the plot is pretty fast at throwing straight into India, it doesn't mess around developing characters and quickly shows us what there really like, and some for me are less than fun to be around. I just couldn't help not liking cast members like Penelope Wilton who although isn't bad at what she does here, she has a character who is wildly annoying and kind of angers you. I liked all the performances though, and to be fair with such pedigree here you wound't expect less lets be honest, but still it has it's bumpy moments of which I will come onto.The plot is kind of two faces, one of the cheesy, humorous but good old fun side, where as the other is that philosophical side, that human nature side that really explores the mind. Both are set nicely and it is characters like Tom Wilkinson's Graham who really bring out that thought provoking and emotional side too. I wasn't too keen on the attempts at comedy, not very funny and only those easily amused should be laughing, this problem comes mainly from the script and direction, just not really made well enough on the humour side.Now getting onto the technical aspects the director John Madden doesn't do a bad job but at times can make this too trivial and doesn't try to get the most out what he has got. The writer would be of course developing his script from the novel ""These Foolish Things"" which this film is based on and although not personally have I read it, it seems that maybe the script is poor and maybe does the book a little dishonour if anything.It's a little on the slow side this, not crawling like a snail but still never really reaching a good speed and until the end parts can seem long drawn and lulling. I think if you enjoy veteran actors getting together and having fun then you should or maybe will hugely enjoy it, as I said there are laughs to be had here and there and maybe if your particularly feeling in a light hearted or jolly mood, you might feel very very pleasant. Although with this I will also say that watch it cynically and watch in a rush wanting things to happen and this will be hated, it is slow and it feels as if it is not ashamed to be so but that it also feels the producers think they were thinking up a fast paced film and one that is exciting, which is only partly the case.Overall it is OK, and not too far from being pretty good but never truly hits the heights of being emotionally charged or funny enough to prize a 7 or even 8 out of 10. Give it a good go of watching I do recommend, take it with a slight pinch and make sure you're a fan of old actors too as this can seem kind of annoying if one is less that favourable to the antics of these characters who seem to try and breath new life into being of an older age.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
82,LloydBayer,"Wholesome entertainment that is equal parts warm and fuzzy, and funny and witty.",8,30 May 2014,"Vastly set in the historic Indian cities of Jaipur and Udaipur, this is a refreshing story of love as perceived by different individuals. These individuals, mostly British senior citizens, arrive at the titular hotel expecting a peaceful retirement as seen in picturesque travel brochures. Instead, what they find is a collapsing hotel building run by an eager yet naïve young owner. For these pensioners, their travels have just begun and even before they arrive at their destination, they will embark on a journey of joy, sadness, prejudice, and even unrequited love. For a country that relies heavily on astrology, numerology and other auspices, India has an unwritten dogma; perhaps you could even call it an unsung chant but it exists across the broadening mentality of a nation that continuous to flourish on its most intrinsic value of hope – or the idea that ""Everything will be alright in the end"". Not only has this become a widely accepted Indian mindset, it has also become the driving theme behind countless Bollywood films where the cinema going populace will settle for nothing less than a happy ending. The Best Exotic marigold Hotel, on the other hand, is not a Bollywood film but a first rate British dramedy that uses the aforementioned virtue as its core ethos.Adapting from Deborah Moggach's novel These Foolish Things, Ol Parker's screenplay here comes alive with the use of a veteran star cast. In the lead and narrating this story is Judi Dench as Evelyn Greensdale, a blogger who chronicles the activities of herself and fellow British pensioners living in India. Her blogs are filled with wisdom that comes with age but also adds repartee to the travel and food scene in India, amongst other things. Others add equal fervour to their characters including Maggie Smith as Muriel Donnelly, a bigot who can't stand the sight of a person of colour. By the end, her transformation into a humane person is one the best parts of the film. Then there's Tom Wilkinson's Graham Dashwood, a high court judge who returns to India, his place of birth and childhood. Wilkinson's character carries a secret that becomes a startling revelation on why he must return, thus setting up one of the film's most sensitive moments. Also adding depth to their characters is the all popular Bill Nighy along with Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup, each with individual stories to tell that blends into a bigger picture, ultimately forging a sense of cross-cultural exploration. Unlike Bollywood's penchant for fairytale endings, The Best Exotic marigold Hotel takes a few steps back and looks at the real world but then a bit of escapism creeps in with a sub-plot involving Dev Patel as the young hotel owner, Sonny. Fresh off the acclaimed success of the Academy Award winning Best Picture, Slumdog Millionaire, Patel's role as the ambitious young hotel owner is the film's most humorous turn but also a weak link when a forbidden love affair panders towards a Bollywood-esque theme of 'Love conquers all'. This minor setback aside, the majority of this film is wholesome entertainment that is equal parts warm and fuzzy, and funny and witty. However, the best part of this film (and if I may refer to this as a character) is India itself, and how director John Madden, cinematographer Ben Davis and music composer Thomas Newman portrays this India feels genuine and strangely alluring. Make no mistake; scripted in detail is poverty, population, pollution and the infamous Indian bureaucracy, but even as these social ills are prominent, India's unmistakable charm and mysticism prevails, matched only by the wit and charm of her former colonialists. And as for the star cast, this film is a prime example that there is no such thing as an aging actor. Simply put, British cinema at its best!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

All the performances were excellent, with Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson standing out; I thought Dev Patel was a tad underused though. I liked the fact that the writers didn't pull too many punches and as such it made the main characters more believable. There was, however, just one niggle; I felt that Dev Patel's character, Sonny, came over as a bit of a caricature rather than a more rounded character. Over all though, I have to say I enjoyed this one and would happily sit down and watch it again sometime.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.7/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
85,HelenMary,"unsurprisingly good, but deeper content than i expected",7,16 September 2014,"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (BEMH) was hands down one of the most highly cast British films for a longtime. Anything with Dame Judy Dench AND Dame Maggie Smith to start with is bound to be excellent. And it is. Superbly cast with great actors, playing simple yet deep characters, without any bells and whistles of high tech, SFX, just doing it properly - it could have easily been a play. You are immediately hooked into the story, and I was quite disappointed when it ended, given I wanted to see more of the story.Each of the characters goes to Jaipur, India, for a different reason; one to find an old love, one to push herself on a budget following bereavement, a couple because they've lost their pension savings, another for cheap hip surgery, some to find love... it's a interwoven tale that mixes east and west brilliantly. Dev Patel does a great turn as enthusiastic run-down-hotelier Sonny Patel, and what an honour to work with such a star-studded company so early in his career, but he holds his own.Suitable for all the family, but due to it's 'right of passage' nature at the older end of the age spectrum younger viewers may not find it so interesting, but like any ensemble cast character film it's well worth it and there is plenty of humour to keep it plodding along, which is good because much of the story lines are actually quite sad or at least not funny. Dev Patel brings much of the physical humour with his manic over-exuberance and love-sickness. Typical British farce-type humour in places but done with a lot of class. An excellent film.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
86,Okonh0wp,Nice Altmanesque story,9,15 May 2013,"An Altmanesque ensemble piece exploring old age, wistfully weaving in and out of several story lines fluidly. The story centers around seven random British retirees (all feeling various stages of incompleteness with their situations) who get lured by an ad to spend their retirement in a hotel that's not as glamorous as advertised.Tom Wilkinson shines as Graham: a gay man who grew up in the days of the Empire in India before moving to India. It's true what they say: Bonus points on your acting resume for going gay. Graham's storyline, involving reconnecting with his homeland and a lost lover lies at the heart of the story.Elsewhere, we have a couple horny seniors looking for love for different reasons (one to feel young, one for financial security), a woman recovering from surgery (Maggie Smith), a hypochondriac, a marriage in flux, and a newly widowed woman taking her first job (Judi Dench). Each of these story lines all provide relatively satisfying layers of richness.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
87,jackasstrange,Pathetic film with bad developed characters and awful direction,5,20 February 2014,"A dangerous and exotic combination of a weak script full of undeveloped characters, forced emotionalism and even racist subtle judgments. What is that? Coming from a British film? The country that 'ruled' India? That seems perversion at it's worst level. The theme of the film, that was about English people that went to India is also ironic and tasteless. In the reality, we all know that it's exactly the opposite. Indian young people goes to England because generally they need to work and are seeking a 'better' life. In the film, old rich British goes to India to relax and pass the last days on the ugly 'Marigold hotel'. As you see, ironic. The constant interfering of the 'old white' in India society is gross and repugnant. The film is always judging the Indian's society even if subtly. And instead of being a film where the ambient changes the characters(which I didn't care for, all of them were bad developed) the characters(old white) most of the time were the ones who changed the ambient until the end. I really see no point of this fake propaganda of British helping Indian people(They were constantly giving lots of money to the Indian people for anything), and the film even subtly judges the a few 'traditions' of India. And being said I am white so please... I am just someone seeing the situation from a different point of view.And the acting was all wrong in my opinion. The actors did well, they brought great emotional depth to the dry characters, but the interpretation wasn't even average, was plain bad, and in that I blame the director. The actors were saying funny lines in a 'dramatic' tone. I mean, it's just nonsense in a supposedly 'comedy' film. And the Indians talking between themselves in English...come on... This film is mediocre and don't deserves to be watched. Racist, at least in my eyes,n and awfully directed. 4.7/ 10",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
88,Chris_Pandolfi,Where Retirees Go to Start Life Anew,7,4 May 2012,"I left John Madden's ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" prepared to describe it as a fairy tale, only to realize how condescending that would be. Here is a film in which contrivances are not a narrative obligation but a means to an end, a method of sending a message that's not only valid but life-affirming as well. Liking this film really has nothing to do with overlooking its obviously manufactured plot and reliably developed characters. It actually depends entirely on your willingness to hear what it has to say. Cynicism will not help you here. I say that as if it were a contractual obligation rather than a welcome opportunity to shed yourself of something heavy. Are today's audiences so world-weary that a positive outlook is no longer welcome in the movies? I find such a prospect troublesome.Adapted from Deborah Moggach's novel ""These Foolish Things,"" the film tells a funny, romantic, and touching story of seven retirees who have relocated themselves from the U.K. to Jaipur, India. Most of them are hoping to start their life anew, although a select few are dragged kicking and screaming. Their destination is the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which was advertised as a peaceful and luxurious retirement resort but is actually still being renovated. This means that basic amenities – such as electricity, running water, working telephones, and in some cases, doors – cannot be guaranteed at this point. The owner, the young and hopelessly naïve Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel), is a dreamer with a lot of enthusiasm but almost no head for business. He inherited the building from his father with only the hope that he could transform it into a hotel.The retirees come from different walks of life, and yet all of them are in desperate need of a transformation. Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a newly widowed woman who has inherited all her late husband's hidden debts. Her computer skills are shoddy, and she has absolutely no work experience, but the prospect of moving in with her son and his family motivates her to strive for independence, which she will hopefully find in India. Graham (Tom Wilkinson) has become disillusioned as a successful High Court judge. Having spent his childhood in India, he decides to return and make peace with his past, which involves an attempt to right a wrong that has plagued him for years. Muriel (Maggie Smith) is a retired housekeeper who desperately needs hip replacement surgery and can only find it in India. The trouble is, her years of insulation from the outside world have made her unpleasantly xenophobic.Douglas (Bill Nighy) made the mistake of lending his retirement money to his daughter for an internet business that may or may not pan out. In India, he hopes to shed his mild-mannered image and experience something new. The same cannot be said for his wife, Jean (Penelope Wilton), a shallow and profoundly negative woman who resists India with every fiber of her being. She finds herself increasingly drawn to Graham, who secretly goes every day to a local hall of records. Likewise, Douglas finds himself drawn to Evelyn, now a consultant at a telecommunications company. Madge (Celia Imrie) and Norman (Ronald Pickup) are both looking for relationships; the former is a multiple divorcée seeking a rich man in exclusive clubs while the latter is a desperately lonely man who missed out earlier in life and just wants a passionate sexual liaison.As six of these seven characters slowly adapt to the culture and landscape of India, Sonny continues to struggle with the hotel and his personal life, clinging to optimism by little more than his fingernails. He's in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae), who works at her brother's call center and is very much modern young woman. Neither situation sits well with Sonny's traditionalist mother (Lillete Dubey), who wants him in an arranged marriage and doesn't believe he's capable of making something out of the hotel. In the meantime, Muriel is the subject of an expected yet appropriate subplot in which she discovers she has something in common with the hotel's lower-caste Indian housekeeper, who cannot speak English.Evelyn records her thoughts daily on a blog, in part to appease her disapproving son but mostly as a way to make sense of her surroundings and the new people in her life. Some of her entries serve as voice-over narrations, especially during the latter half of the film, at which point we witness several scenes that are tidy and convenient yet indisputably poignant. She eventually writes out one of Sonny's lines, transforming it from a desperate plea to a powerful and moving philosophy: ""Everything will be all right in the end. So if it is not all right, it is not yet the end."" Would the world be a better place if we all adopted this mindset? I'd like to think so. Yes, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is contrived, but I believe its inspiring message more than makes up for that. Sometimes, it's much healthier to embrace lofty ideals than to blindly accept life's harsh realities.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel may not be anything new or groundbreaking, but at its core lies an unmistakable charm to it.

The cast is all top notch, including but not limited to Dames Maggie Smith and Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, and especially Tom Wilkinson. The pacing, structure, and focus does get flimsy occasionally, and at times it plays too much like a vacation advertisement, but it makes every moment of those two hours count.

90,PipAndSqueak,Diversion for a miserable day,8,9 November 2014,"The great joy of this film is that it is clearly made 'on location' with light and colour suitably vibrant. This puts into true context the miserable and grey character played wonderfully by Penelope Wilton. It is not stated, but, one can only assume that her character had previously 'had it all' prior to her husbands retirement and hence his efforts to plan for their far off dotage. A couple of filmic tricks are used to provide narrative twists, both are pulled off to great effect. Nevertheless, you may still feel a little short changed as some specific dialogue given to the characters then rings hollow. Dench and Wilkinson manage to carry slightly faulty characters with aplomb whilst others will make your toes curl - intentional, I'm sure.

92,badajoz-1,Nice but not good enough,6,21 March 2012,"A film about old age (I am a pensioner) and several characters going on a last adventure to find a new life in India - with a stellar cast of Brit thesps. What could go wrong? Well, it's a nice film, charming and not very stretching, with some excellent acting that tops up the actors' pensions. They had a ball no doubt, and we get a flavour (but a very small pallid one) of modern day India. But the script is very superficial and mainly about sex and relationships in a very stereotypical manner - eg gay man searches for lost love, couple who have nothing left after 40 years, grieving widow who has to start again, randy ram and ewe looking for some action, and racist ex-housekeeper who has to find herself in a strange land. The adventure is not very visual - cast members keep talking about that lovely temple or such and such an experience, but we see very little. They do not sweat in the heat!!!! And a normal couple still loving each other after many years is obviously absent from the story - how old was the scriptwriter? After some adventures as a pensioner while travelling this film did not really come close to reflecting that experience - a great pity! The young couple of Indian actors play out a very western romance, while the male lead - Dev Patel - is interchangeable with the Indian train driver in Kenneth More's 'North West Frontier' from the late fifties - oh dear! But a nice way to pass an afternoon where there were no silly overlong action scenes and CGI to make up for a lack of ideas.

It has an outstanding cast with some of the greats of British cinema such as Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and Tom Wilkinson. There are some great supporting actors like Penelope Wilton and Ronald Pickup but as usual Bill Nighy steals the show.The rather far-fetched story revolves around a group of people in their advancing years who for various reasons, decide to move from the UK to a run down former hotel in India. An enthusiastic but slightly incompetent local young man, played by Dev Patel, runs the hotel.We see the back-stories of each of the main characters and see how they cope with living in a new continent. There is a predictable quota of amusing and touching moments and you always feel you are in safe hands with the cast of familiar faces.There are no unpleasant shocks at the end of the movie but you should leave the cinema with a smile on your face.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
98,manendra-lodhi,Filled with love and problems.,8,5 August 2012,"The film follows the journey of some old people who choose India as the place to spend some of their times. Somehow every one of them is unhappy with what life is offering them. Each character has distinguished quality. Some of them liked the place and others have their own problems. Than we have Jaipur boy named sonny who is trying everything to make his hotel a success. The film fulfilled what it was made for. Not much of an expert of western old age but whatever was shown seemed to be apt. PROS:For the whole time, the film had what I would say, neutral vibes. You will never feel depressed and on the other hand there are only a few moments when you will feel cherished and that is brilliant in the film. The characters have acted so nicely that not even for a moment you will find a problem with the flow of the story. The story obviously is nicely done and the director has done a nice job in making a wonderful film which might had looked dull and slow. Besides the acting and story, Jaipur was filmed very nicely and gave a natural feel to the film in a very profound manner. Each character wakes up in the morning and tries to find his/her own path to achieve peace. Initially they don't want to indulge much among themselves but slowly they do develop an amazing relationship with each other.CONS:The side characters had not been properly analyzed and that was the only weak link that I found in the whole film. However it is easily ignorable. MESSAGE: ""You need to find mental peace sooner or later.""VERDICT: ""Must see at least once""",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
99,rgblakey,Prepare for a stay at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,9,21 September 2012,"There are some movies that come along and just feel special from the beginning. Whether it's the cast involved, the trailer or the subject matter, when these films come along it gives fans hope that finally something different and new is coming to theaters. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel sports an impressive cast including Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Dev Patel, but will the story work well to mesh this pile of talent together into that something special or will it just be another one of those films that could have been? The Best Exotic Marigold follows a group of retirees that decide to ""outsource"" their retirement to less expensive and seemingly exotic India. Enticed by advertisements for the newly restored Marigold Hotel, they arrive to find the palace a shell of its former self. On the surface the story her is pretty simple, but as it progresses forward it starts revealing more depth than you would have thought. Every one of these brilliant actors do a great job with their characters and seems to be just having a great time together. With this kind of talent it's hard to say who did better than who since they all brought so much to this special little film, but Maggie Smith seemed to steal the show whenever she was on screen. For a smaller film with such a big cast, the location gives it the feel of a much larger budget. This is one of those movies that is filled with a wide range of emotions that stems from laughter, to heartache that will takes these characters on a journey of self-discovery of themselves and what they are truly missing in their lives. There are some aspects of this movie that will remind of you The Big Chill, but instead of old friends coming together, these are new friends coming together for an experience none of them expected.Filled with a brilliant cast, a heartwarming story, in the beautifully unique India setting, this is the type of film that will appeal to anyone out there. There are aspects of this film that relate to more than just the older generation, but to everyone out there. Be on the lookout, this film has Oscar performances all over it, but will be hard to decide who to root for.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

103,troy-manatunga,"""As we grow bolder our parents grow older –Watch over them""",8,2 September 2012,"An absolutely wondrous cinematic experience and a heart tugging story is director John Maddens THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. Watching the trailer to movies is a habit I try to quit but it's like the bad habit of smoking. It isn't all that easy to give up and stick by. Never the less I was not able to grab a glimpse of the trailer to THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL and my expectations were that in line with COUPLES RETREAT with a veteran cast. The artwork used for publicity is so colorful that one can easily mistake it for a prop that fell of the AUSTIN POWERS wagon.Instead of a colorful resort the viewer is transported in the Madden vehicle over to India. Over to the newly restored THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL which is light years away from ever being able to live up to the standards that it has advertised. THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL for the elderly and beautiful is managed by Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel). Sonny is an ambitious lad who has renovated his father's old hotel and is thriving to build on the business by outsourcing the idea of retirement in India. His first groups of guests are 7 British retirees who travel to India to spend their autumn years and bask in the glory of the nature of India and to finally relax after years of hard work and turmoil. What they find out is that Sonny has gone out on a limb in advertising his hotel and had focused on advertising the hotel what it will be rather than what it exactly is right now.The beauty of THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is how the groups of people adapt to living in this new land and how some of them begin to love the new life of retirement while a certain few simply are stubborn and prefer to remain aristocratic even though such a life style is beyond what they can afford. From where I am seated my understanding of Oscar Nominated director John Maddens approach to the message is that we all grow old and we all will have to deal with it the way we can when the time does arrive. THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is simply an idea that we all have of our future and our retirement. However when the time comes will that place be the place that we all dream and work towards everyday of our youthful life. Will it be the place I go to die? Will it be the place I go to find meaning for my life? Will it be the place I go to find someone special since I have been living my life all by self?To each question stated above there is a character written into THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL by Olive Parker. An absolute wizard with creativity and unorthodox story lines related to reality and facts. Unlike a creative script of Time Travel, Aliens or Greek Gods coming to earth to fight our battles Olive Parker gets creative within the realms of human control. Magically written and brilliantly directed there is only but the cherry on the top left for me to pen down.The absolutely versatile star veteran cast. Maggie Smith, Judie Dench, Bill Nighy, Penelope Wilton, Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie and Tom Wilkinson are each uniquely given a character that grows and builds with the viewers during the 124 minutes. The direction, writing and the acting is ever so well paced that no character is entirely exposed and there is always growth during the 124 minutes. Even the last 10 minutes of the movie shows certain characters yet developing. They are not adapting to circumstances, but they develop to be better people and live life on their own terms. They will grow on you until the end credit begin to role up the screen.As I said this is a brilliant movie for the young and the old and certainly has great value and great learning's for both generations. Coming from the younger generation I would like to end this piece with a note to the younger readers and viewers.""As we grow bolder our parents grow older –Watch over them""TITLE: THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL DIRECTED BY: JOHN MADDEN STARRING: MAGGIE SMITH, JUDIE DENCH, BILL NIGHY,PENELOPE WILTON, RONALD PICKUP,CELIA IMRIE, DEV PATEL AND TOM WILKINSON RATED: PG 13 RATING: 08/10 124 MINUTES",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
104,AnishMisra,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Review,8,28 July 2018,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a film directed by John Madden. Since the film was with me in my DVR, I decided to give this a watch with no hopes. But at the end of it, I felt very satisfied.Plot: A group of British pensioners moving to a retirement hotel in India, run by the young and eager Sonny.Story and direction: If I do watch it from a story point of view, it isn't ground-breaking in any way. The film has the most predictable story ever. We have a couple facing issues, an old man finding a perfect mate for himself, a woman who is fearful of almost everything, etc.. These themes have been dealt with in ample number of films. But what attracted me to this film more is the setting and the characters. The characters of the film make the story so believable that you can forget the story for some time and enjoy the flow of the movie. India is shown in the best way possible. I being an Indian was happy in the ay India was depicted here. It showed me the real India. The atmosphere and climate of the film instantly attracted me. Ben Davis has done a wonderful job of capturing the very essence of India. Thomas Newman's score also adds to the beauty of the film. He scores the film the way A R Rahman would have scored it. Performances: This film is filled with wonderful performances. Judi Dench just lives her role and it is always a treat to watch her perform. The same can be said for Maggie Smith. Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton play the most realistic husband-wife with ease. Ronald Pickup and Celia Imrie also complemented the film. Diana Hardcastle gave a compelling performance. Tom Wilkinson made us believe in his character by his incredible performance. Dev Patel and Tina Desae gave earnest performances. It was good to see Lilette Dubey too. The other local Indian actor added to the beauty of this film.Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Douglas comforts Evelyn much to the chagrin of his wife, Jean. It showed the bond that formed between the characters Douglas and Evelyn very nicely.Verdict: With its stellar performances and its premise, if the film would have worked on the story going rather an unconventional route rather than the route that has been taken several times, the film would have worked wonders. Nevertheless, I had a good time watching the film.I am going with an 8/10.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

106,dhaufrect-1,A Mature film with a superb cast.,10,11 June 2012,"""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is superbly done with well honed actors, and a script to boot. There is no trick photography or 3 D effect, nor are there any of the popular computer generated images that fill the popular films of today. However, this movie captures ones heart and mind with a beauty of culture and language which is like going to a very satisfying play. John Madden has done an artful directorial piece and he should be proud of it. It is based on the novel by Deborah Moggach and screenplay by Ol Parker. The story revolves around a group of British retirees who travel to India, each expecting a more luxurious set of accommodations more compatible with their upper middle class surroundings back in Great Britain. To their surprise the hotel is closer to a third world environment, but to their credit they do give it a chance, a choice which pays off for most in the crowd. I do not want to give away the plot, however, suffice it to say that it is a rewarding trip and a very compelling cinema. Judi Dench gives one of her very best performances as Evelyn Greenslade. She captures the essence of this character with her usual mature approach. Tom Wilkinson is Graham Dashwood, and pensive character of complex emotion and history. He underplays so very well in this movie, that it is worth seeing just to enjoy his character performance. and Bill Nighy is Douglas Ainslie, another very intense character played to perfection. Maggie Smith's performance is one not to be missed as Muriel Donnelly, and like Judi Dench is another jewel to behold. Be sure to put this one on your must see list.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
107,jaxbubba,A truly exceptional film!!!!!,8,1 July 2012,"A truly exceptional film, featuring the very best of the British Acting Royalty. Dame Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson, Penelope Wilton, Liza Tarbuck, and Ronald Pickup all star in the this delightful film.The seven principle characters of this film have all come to a point in their lives, where remaining in the UK is no longer feasible, mostly due to financial reasons. Each has stumbled across a brochure outlining the wonderful possibilities that await them in India at a newly refurbished Marigold Hotel. Enrollment into the hotel facilities includes the flight to India as well. However, upon arrival; it seems that the facilities are far less luxurious than advertise.The film follows each individual through his or her path of awakening; for each individual has come to India for a different reason. A very charming film, well acted, well scripted, and well directed. The Indian backdrop for this film is exquisite!!! I highly recommend this film a joy to behold!!! And as the film clearly states, ""a person who risks nothing, does nothing, has nothing! And all we know of the future is that is will be different, but perhaps what we fear most, is that it will remain the same. So we must celebrate the changes!!! Because as someone once said, 'everything will be all right in the end. And if it's not all right, then trust me. It's not yet the end'!!!!!!!! A really fantastic film, with a great message, and one that I am sure that you will enjoy as well!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS ON FB @ ""THE FARIS REEL""",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
108,paul_3-960-896774,crowded but fun to watch,7,5 March 2015,"The Best Marigold Hotel never sounded like a movie I would want to watch, the title alone kinda put me off, but then I heard about the cast, which is essentially the cream of British Comedy in one film so I check it out.I had a smile on my face for a good portion of this movie, it was fun, heartwarming and a pleasure to watch. The characters all have an individual flavor that feels natural because it's obviously put in the ends of talented actors, who didn't dive into the stereotypical sh*t. I didn't necessarily relate to these lovely old folks, I'm not nearly as old, but I got to a place where i understood and came like them. Dev Patel as the lesser experienced of the cast did held his own, I half expected him to completely make a fool of himself but he's OK.The movie is mostly set up India so of course there are colors, people, warmth and life in those shots and it counter shocks with the cold gray ones in England. They didn't go into a Bollywood mood as I thought they would which was refreshing because the movie is already crowded with a lot of story lines, which is my only real problem with the film.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
109,julian-mumford,"India, where your ""Grey Pound goes further""....",7,5 April 2012,"Getting old in the UK sucks, it's official.If you are also a bit short of cash you might want to find somewhere where your grey pound goes a bit further.Spain, France or how about India, that ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" sounds like an excellent proposition, to gracefully see out your retirement years.So decide, an eclectic bunch of couples and singles, covering most of the stereotypes of British retirement traits.Shrill, unjustifiably snobby and opinionated Jean (Penelope Wilson) & decent but hen pecked husband, Douglas (Bill Nighy). Racist, wizened ""old dear"" Muriel (Maggie Smith), with a pressing need for a new hip, as long as it is not installed by ""one of them"". Smith, with an accent that would be out of place in the Kitchen of Downton Abbey, let alone ""upstairs"".Norman (Ronald Pickup) an aging Lothario, Madge (Celia Imrie) desperately seeking any man with a heartbeat and a fat wallet, ""I'm alone by choice, just not my choice"" and Evelyn (Judi Dench) bringing some sense of reason and tolerance to the group.Finally, we have Barrister Graham (Tom Wilkinson) with his own agenda for leaving his stuffy law office behind.Our merry band of emigrants descend on a perceived haven of misspelled old world luxury and rest and relaxation, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"". The truth of course is less than they might have expected. Energetic hotel manager Sonny (Dev Patel) does his best to put an Indian optimistic spin on a half renovated, dilapidated hotel but in reality, this is not the dream the glossy brochures promised.The fun of course is how the group and individuals react to their new life and subsequent loss of a dream.It goes without saying that the acting is of a high quality. Stereotypes abound, Sonny's girlfriend Sunaina (Desae) works in a call centre, Muriel's meals are brought by an ""untouchable"" but the whole feel of the movie is good natured and director John Madden does not set out to offend in anyway. That life in India is different, in some ways better, some worse, is obvious and suits some but not others.""Everything will be alright in the end, if it is not alright, it is not the end"", very mystical but it does not fix your leaking tap.The perhaps unintentional central message of ""it sucks to get old"" comes through but the subtext of making the most of every day is a universal message we can all take away.Not a lot happens, characters change and we learn more about the background of the individuals. There are light moments, however this is more of a drama than a comedy but the target market for the film should come away with a solid nights entertainment.Filmed almost entirely on location, the film makes good use of the local colour and chaos, the cast clearly enjoying what must have been a great, although difficult, filming experience for all concerned.Hard to criticize such a pleasant film that tries hard to please and covers most of the bases. On occasion a bit more downbeat than the trailers might promise but overall ""uplifting"" might be the final feeling taken away. Certainly, if the premise of the story brings you to the cinema, there should be few surprises in store.Summary If the trials and tribulations of following a mixed bag of English retirees suffering culture shock as they outsource their retirement to India is of interest, then there will be plenty to enjoy here.Audiences born after 1990 should bear in mind the above.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

A sparkling cast that leaves nothing to be desired – Judy Dench is her usual magnificent self as is Maggie Smith. Ever seen anything bad from these two seasoned performers? I sure haven't and this movie will not disappoint. And the guys – Bill Nighy , Tom Wilkinson – well, all of them to be honest are flawless. Set in a not-so-perfect retirement home for the 'elderly and beautiful' that will steal your heart are story lines you will love, involving characters you will very much care about. The young Indian owner of this off-beat but endearing hotel, Dev Patel, as an especially delightful Sonny, you can't help but take to your heart. He's a total joy. Laughs, poignancy, despair, delight.this movie has it all and frankly, I can't wait for it to come out on DVD so I can buy it. And I don't buy many.

111,jburtroald95,Gave me some great birthday viewing!,7,13 April 2012,"When the charming and lively Sonny, a young member of the modern Indian generation, is left to mind the dilapidated old estate shared between him and his brothers, he optimistically undertakes to transform it into the luxurious, opulent ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the elderly and beautiful. Although the pieces of this glorious endeavour are not quite yet in place, he nevertheless sets it in motion and, through the magic of digital advertising, entices a predictably varied but not overly oddball group of English seniors to spend a couple months there. Naturally, the unwitting guests discover a multitude of faults and fissures in the supposed regal paradise, but most of them are content to embrace the earthiness and unpredictability of this profoundly different country, neatly captured by the sprightly manager's frequent reply of the Indian saying ""Everything will be all right in the end... if it's not all right then it's not the end"". However, the concerns of his typically traditionalist mother are much harder to brush off, particularly as she doubts not only his ability to succeed with the hotel, but the appropriateness of his spunky girlfriend and hopeful fiancé, Sunaina. Although that plot summary makes it seem as though Sonny and his romantic involvements are the centrepiece of this winsome comic creation, this really is an ensemble piece in which screen time is divided fairly evenly between its dozen or so characters, but inevitably there are a select handful of separate stories that attract more interest and emotional involvement than the others. The jovial and kindly Evelyn is by far the most sympathetic of the women, as her brave personal endeavour to have her first adventure without her dear late husband carries a realistic sentimentality that's much more digestible than the old, overused ""star-crossed lovers"" plot line. The graceful and fearless Judi Dench heads the cavalry very well with the character whose poignant introductory scene opens the movie, and whose daily blog makes her the film's part-time narrator as well. Although, surprisingly, it is among the men that the most heart wrenching sub-plot can be found. Tom Wilkinson gives a very passionate performance as Graham, a particularly unwilling retiree whose long-gone period of residency in India contains is embroiled in his own tragic romantic entanglements that allow him to sympathise with Evelyn. The scene where the two of them openly discuss their past and their emotional trauma is one of the film's most powerful scenes, so it would be terrible of me to disclose any more of Graham's tale. The other two male produce many more laughs than tears, although the amusement isn't always intentional. Ronald Pickup has great fun playing a restless wanderer with an insatiable sexual appetite that the film initially concedes is repellent, but soon grows to accept that one is never too old to enjoy youthful pleasures. It also bears no shame in showing Evelyn develop a loving companionship with the very compassionate Douglas (a grossly miscast Bill Nighy) who, despite his overwhelming kindness, is becoming increasingly distant from his intolerable wife (Penelope Wilton). Douglas is certainly not a humorous character; he merely has a few sarcastically comedic moments and these are relished by the bombastic and snarky comic, but when it comes to the scores of dramatic scenes he flounders. Clearly, he has run out of uses for that immovable stupefied expression and theatrical, elongated delivery of his, after effortlessly embodying a pompous pop star in Love Actually (2003) and hiding behind a marine motion capture mask in the middle couple of Pirates of the Caribbean films, and is too egotistical to let his physical and vocal features vary in order to express emotion – otherwise known as ""acting"" – as he did fleetingly in films like Notes on a Scandal (2006). As the overrated diva collapses in the face of the demands Ol Parker's more than decent script, the audience if forced to picture a real actor, like Jeremy Irons, bring the part to life.Douglas' wife intentionally makes us cringe as Wilton does what she does best and plays a sycophantic, overbearing social climber that is in this case chasing after Graham in the hope of profiting from his former position as a judge in the Supreme Court. On occasion Celia Imrie confidently trots out her similar natural talents, although her character, Madge, is not so deluded that she doesn't sympathise with the ill-matched married couple. Probably the most horrid and yet oddly the next most endearing of the women is Muriel (Maggie Smith) a stubbornly English wheelchair-bound pessimist whose outgoing xenophobia is understandable in her old age, but still makes her very unappealing to those around her byt also sharply funny to the audience. Her eventual sentimental epiphany might be predictable, as is the ending in general, but it is completely believable. One might say the same for the way that all the romantic plot threads conveniently come together for a most cloying conclusion that's been replicated several times over, but an explosively original finale is almost impossible to manage in a film that has set out be a heart-warming, PG-rated, gentle field trip, and it could have been much worse. John Madden has never been a master of wrangling the sprawl of sub-plots in films that run on charm and adrenalin, even in his multi-award-winning Shakespeare in Love (1997). Although here he is, as usual, saved by his finely chosen acting ensemble. Smith, Dench and Wilton do very well with smoothing over the cracks in the uneven scripting, as do the lovable Dev Patel (the lead in Slumdog Millionaire) as Sonny and the rest of the widely unknown Indian cast. The trick to enjoying these types of movies is to realise that the sharp wit and earnest storytelling was good while it lasted, and sometimes give it the benefit of the doubt.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
112,Suradit,British Whine Country,6,18 September 2012,"The movie is supposedly based on the book of the same name. Aside from sharing the same title, a few of the same characters and the setting in India, however, the two have little in common. In this case the movie is far superior to the book, which is muddled, disconnected and populated by a mélange of characters, most of whom, thankfully, never made it into the movie.Despite the best efforts of the screenplay writers to rescue a tedious and confused novel, it is the excellent cast of actors who make the movie worthwhile. I suppose the intention was to focus on the trials and tribulations of the elderly as they come to terms with the sordid reality of their past lives and the prospect of making the most of the little time they have left. Instead we seem to be faced with a bunch of whining, self-absorbed, petulant and obnoxious Brits who by the movie's conclusion are supposedly transformed into loving, caring individuals (for the most part) who teach the poor inadequate Indians how to sell things by telephone, how to run a hotel and how to stand up to domineering mothers so that love can conquer all. Clearly, despite all evidence to the contrary, the British still think they have so much to teach the world while they coincidentally continue to shoulder their long-standing, self-assigned White Man's Burden.Interesting also that in the novel it was the lecherous & creepy heterosexual Norman who died in a brothel, while in the movie Norman finds respectability and true love, but the one gay character is killed off.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

But then it wasn't the first choice for most of the characters in this film, and they still ended up there. Wanna know why?Evelyn Greenside (played by Judi Dench) is a housewife who was recently widowed. In addition to her grief, her husband's death has left her with massive debts. While discussing her husband's account with a representative of her internet service provider, she causes an abrupt change in tone when she informs the person on the other end of the phone, whose Indian accent is easily noticeable, that her husband is dead. We are later introduced to a High Court judge named Graham Dashwood. Dashwood (played by Tom Wilkinson) is on his way to the most recent in what seems to be an endless series of retirement parties. He's dreading the event a great deal and, rather than suffer through the festivities, he simply says, ""This is the day"" as a way of announcing his own retirement and then leaves the party without another word. Next, we have the Ainslies. Douglas Ainslie (played by Bill Nighy) and his wife Jean (played by Penelope Wilton) are exploring a number of less- than-enticing bungalows where they might spend their golden years. They'd hoped for something grander, but invested a large portion of their savings in their daughter's internet business and have yet to see that business turn a profit. Muriel Donnelly (played by Maggie Smith) is a cantankerous former housekeeper who needs a hip replacement but finds the wait, cost, and personnel at her local hospital unappealing. All these characters are made aware, in varying ways, of a seemingly beautiful retirement community in India named The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful. However, when they arrive, they soon find out that Sonny, the hotel's young and enthusiastic manager (played by Dev Patel), has misrepresented the accommodations at the hotel. He neglected to mention the hotel's shabby appearance, failing plumbing, and non-functioning phone service. Now I failed to introduce two other characters in the story. They are single by choice and have come to India looking for romance. Without cluing you in to the ending, the film avoids the obvious cliché of the two finding love in each other's arms while still allowing them to find contentment. For that reason and others, I loved this film. There are twists, surprises, happy endings, not-so-happy endings. All that merely punctuates the brilliant portrayals offered by a cast that already has many on their respective. The inexplicably optimistic character played by former Slumdog Millionaire and now supporting actor on HBO's The Newsroom, Dev Patel is a constant source of amusement.

They traipse through their surroundings in a pointless, meaningless way that is not entertaining, and hardly rates calling it a story at all.So why rate it as high as a 3?

Wonderful realistic story in so many ways, even if the DVD cover says it is a fairy tale. I wish there was a Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, I could retire in. I hope it did well in the box office so that producers make more movies like that. I am at retirement age so for me it was a film which hit home, but I can imagine that it appeals to a younger audience too, if they venture in it. It was funny and set in a stunning location.For me it was like visiting old friends. I have been to Jaipur and Udaipur many years ago and found both cities fascinating and exotic. I could remember the kind of transportation the group was using in the film. I thought I would never survive the bus rides on the country roads in Rajistan. Obviously not much has changed since I visited nearly thirty years ago. It still looks very chaotic.The thing, they did not have, when I was there, were call centers. And I can only hope that the owners of these call centers saw that movie and teach their employees to act like human beings and not only follow the given written down instructions without even listening to the responses of their customers..Nearly all the actors were familiar , though I sometimes could not figure out where from. I remembered Dev Patel, who plays the hotel owner, from Slum dog Millionaire and liked him better in this role, Lillete Dubey from Monsoon Wedding (another great movie about India) and of course Maggie Smith from Downton Abbey, Quartet and Harry Potter among many others, Judy Dench from Notes on a Scandal and Shipping News and I think I saw a James Bond movie with her. It took me some time to remember where I had seen Bill Nighy before , it was the Constant Gardener and Tom Wilkinson in 'In the Bedroom'. Penelope Wilton I remembered very well from Match Point and Downton Abbey. Ronald Pickup and Celia Imrie I had to look up, they seem to have done more TV series and I might have seen them there. All of them great actors and how refreshing to see naturally aged faces........ They made you forget that they are acting. What a beautiful movie! If you have not seen it , get the DVD or see it online.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

I see the comedy but I also appreciate, as others have already said, the reality of what growing older can mean to different people. It's a great story and the acting is superb. I didn't laugh much because I found a lot of resonance in my own life and the poignancy took over for me. All were excellent - especially Judi Dench and Bill Nighy, but also Dev Patel and the girlfriend - their youthful energy contrasted with the older cast members finding their feet in a strange land.It was inspiring and believable. I have been to Sri Lanka and while not as huge or chaotic as India, I understand the culture shock. Older viewers will find much to think about and I hope younger people will too.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
119,joncha,Too many subplots,8,6 October 2018,"This film has an outstanding cast, but unfortunately there were too many subplots to go into much detail about each one. The viewer is left wishing to learn more about each character's story. Also, it's obvious that India has a lot of people and poverty, but the camera rarely pulls back and lets you see the grandeur of the country. As shown, it's more like being in Grand Central Station or Times Square all the time.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
120,caiged,"Good, solid entertainment which is both funny and moving",8,22 May 2012,"Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a surprise sleeper that not many people will go and watch and it's a shame. Possibly the old cast, whose combined ages probably reaches around 300, may be a turn off, as well as the plot gleaned from the trailers about seniors finding new adventure in a foreign land. But it's much more that that. It's about awakening, realizing that old age is not a milestone where one reaches and gives up. It's about continuing to live, to embrace life, to understand your own shortcomings and dealing with them. One thing this movie shows is that it's never to late to change.The movie's about seven Britishers who are strangers to one another but find themselves connected when they all book a flight to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel located in Jaipur, India, after seeing a rather impressive brochure for seniors. However, when they arrive they find to their dismay that the hotel is not at all what they envisioned. And so begins each of their journeys.There are some fine performances by Dame Judi Dench, who plays a recent widow, and Dame Maggie Smith, an ailing woman with an imminent hip replacement surgery and more than a touch of xenophobia. Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy provide good support. The other characters are good in small humorous roles, except for Penelope Wilton, who plays Nighy's wife, a deeply bitter and resentful woman. Dench and Smith carry most of the movie on their shoulders, each of their stories taking up a good portion of the movie, never intersecting and never boring. It is Smith's story that proves to be more touching as she transforms the most out of the whole group.The pace of the movie is slow but it can be excused as there are no twists, thrills, or explosions and you want this movie to be slow so that you can focus on what's happening in the background. The movie is shot in Rajasthan and the scenery is breathtaking, and you can see the beauty of the city that's reflected in the surroundings and the people who live in it.The humour is good but there are several moving moments that are well, if not unexpectedly, placed. John Madden has done a good job in giving the actors enough leeway to do a good job and the editing is good enough that you wish the movie was longer than the two hour running time.Are there any downsides? Well, Dev Patel was not very good. His Indian accent was overdone and obvious and he hammed a lot. He didn't add much to the star power of the movie so even a competent local actor would have been sufficient. At least he wouldn't have had to fake an accent. In any case it's not as if the audience would have recognized him. I also didn't like Penelope Wilton's character as she never did anything or tried anything to change her attitude or to be a part of the adventure. I also wish that Madden had shot some longer scenes in other parts of the city. Bill Nighy's character would go out to different parts of the city and was impressed with what he saw. I wish that we did too, instead of hearing about it in one sentence.But, all in all, it's a fine movie to watch. Judging by the crowd I'd say it's a movie for the more senior variety so if anyone reading this fits that category then by all means head over to the closest cinema playing the movie and lose yourself for a couple of hours!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
121,anupviswanath,A good IND-BRIT Movie,8,3 March 2013,"I watched this movie because of my favorite actors. The casting was simply superb and the portrayal of each characters at the beginning is too good to be the reason for their travel to India. The movie had soul and heart of Indian society and how everything works. The crowded buses where all can fit in, the risky drive in buses,blaring horns from vehicles, the hotels that show you something in brochures and different in reality. I am born in India and still am in India. I had same experience when I had gone to one place where I booked hotel through internet but when I actually went there got stunned. Going to servants home and appreciating her work was awesome take because her character took care of children,home etc finally she was left alone during her old age. Every actors played their parts too well but the only thing I thing in India that doesn't happen or won't be possible is to kiss a girl in public. The main difference between India and WESTERN COUNTRIES are -> You can pass urine anywhere in India but not KISS but in western countries you can KISS anyone anywhere but not pass urine in public. Also the dialog ""Everything will be all right in the end.So if it is not all right,it is not yet the end."" reminded me of Shahrukh's Om Shanti Om where he says ""Life is like a film, it always has a happy ending and if there is no happy ending it means that the film is not done yet)"". The movie has done justice to India and not mocked INDIANs to a good extent. The dialog at start made me feel bad ( black people with black heart ) but towards the end the opinions changed for her. The BPO office scene is also quite superb because once I was in US and an elderly described how annoyed he was when he was trying to get help by calling customer care (the cultures are different and that was the result). Probably the best movie describing India as it is now.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It was a moment that struck me as brutally honest and heartbreaking at the same time. Unfortunately ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" doesn't have enough moments like that. But despite the rather old-fashioned sensibility of the film and its desire to sacrifice realism for clichés, I simply couldn't dislike this movie. The cast is first rate. Judi Dench and Tom Wilkinson are excellent as a widower seeking independence and a judge returning to India in search of forgiveness. Maggie Smith is a contentious bigot; Bill Nighy is the wimpy husband of harpy Penelope Wilton and Ronald Pickup and Celia Imrie are lonely singles trying to prove they haven't lost it. Dev Patel (Slumdog Millionaire) is the frantic dreamer who believes he can make a success of the rundown hotel he inherits from his father. ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is a mixed bag. The predictable script made me flinch once or twice but I enjoyed the performances and the Indian scenery and cinematography enough to recommend it.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
124,middleburg,Everything WILL be all right in the end: The Best Exotic Marigold Movie.,10,2 June 2012,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a wonderful twisting and turning maze of a film (like the maze of Jaipur's markets with their frenetic chaos and gorgeous burst of color), with seven distinct, charming, annoying, frustrating, endearing, wise, colorful Brits and several equally distinct, charming, etc. etc. Indians whose lives we miraculously learn all about, care about, get angry at, shed a tear with, laugh with...and at, and ultimately wish them all enduring happiness during the precious waning or waxing years of their lives. Seeing this film in a NYC theatre filled with people like myself - gray-haired, yet often feeling like 18-year-olds, despite what the mirror too often tells us, we were laughing up a storm, shedding those tears, and embracing the meaning and message of this film. ABOUT TIME there's another movie for us ""Golden Oldies""!! Are there a few clichés a la ""Enchanted April"", or a few moments where it is necessary to suspend belief and accept the fantasy like ""Forrest Gump""? You Bet! But that can be the magic of cinema! To get lost in a fantasy, to treasure an adventure in a foreign land, to listen to wizened, but wise people, flawed, some more than others, knocked about by life, but with the fortitude to realize that it is not over until it's over! Like the classic movies of the 70's such as ""Harold and Maude"" and ""King of Hearts"", there are so many delectable bits of dialogue or wonderful sound bites that just shine with wisdom and understanding at the Divine Comedy of life: Graham waxing rhapsodic over the ""Light, Colors, Smiles""of his cherished India, saying that ""It teaches me something!""; Evelyn's simple declaration that ""India, like Life itself, I suppose, is what you bring to it"", and the goofy, eternally optimistic Sonny intoning with youthful wisdom that ""Everything will be all right in the end, so if it is not all right, it is not yet the end!"". One walks out of the film enchanted--with India, with these lovely cast of characters, so beautifully and vividly sketched by a stellar British ensemble, and with optimism that Everything WILL be all right in the end!""",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
125,intern-88,The best inoffensive film to watch with your parents,8,6 June 2012,"When I manage to escape the university life of cheap drinks, hangovers and the occasional deadline, spending a few days at home comes as a welcome and civilised break from it all. As well the novelties of home-cooked food and unashamed abuse of the central heating, you can do things like go and see a film, safe in the knowledge that – after an evidently phony attempt at reaching for your wallet – the parents will pay.But when it comes to choosing what film to see, it can often be tricky. While in the good old days, they usually had to bend to my will and to the limits of certification, now I'm 20 and tantrums aren't quite as acceptable, it unfortunately has to be more of a compromise.I didn't go and see The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel with my parents, but I rather wish I had. John Madden's bittersweet retiree romp has enough light humour, class and vaguely affecting turns to make it a perfect choice. Needless to say, I'm certain mum and dad would have found this breezily bland film as inoffensively enjoyable as I did.Essentially, it is a story full of corny Eat Pray Love soul-searching, with a rabble of wisened British sixtysomethings looking for a place to enjoy their autumn years. They've never met before, but the fates conspire to bring them together when they each come across an advert for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, which is described as a palatial retirement home for the 'elderly and beautiful' in the Indian city of Jaipur. Upon arrival, however, the punters find the promised palace in a pretty sorry state, much like themselves. The walls are crumbling, the phones don't work and some of the rooms don't even have a fully-functioning door. Swayed by the incurable optimism of the hapless young Indian hotel manager, Sonny (Dev Patel), and the fact that he wouldn't be able to provide a refund any time soon, the fogies decide to make the most of it.The seven main characters represent a concoction of late-in-life anxieties: There's Graham (Tom Wilkinson), who comes to India in search of his lost love; Muriel (Maggie Smith), a bitter old woman hoping for a quick hip replacement; Norman (Ronald Pickup) and Madge (Celia Imrie), who are both sex-starved and lonely; Jean (Penelope Wilton) and Douglas (Bill Nighy), whose marriage is on its last, arthritic legs; and Evelyn (Judi Dench), a melancholy widow. Over the course of the film, they all come to terms with their respective baggage and find a new zest for life.In the meantime, we are treated to a slew of decently funny culture-clash gags as the old dears struggle to adapt to their new home. There are scenes of curry-induced dicky tummies, perilous tuk-tuk rides and Norman turning to the Kama Sutra to get a few pointers. Counterweighted with a few more sombre scenes, the plot eases along rather nicely.As is to be expected, the depiction of India is very much from the eye of the tourist. Rather than seeing the ravaged towns around Jaipur as scenes of destitution, the guests of the hotel reflect on their surroundings as a sea of smiles and colour. Such blatant cultural clichés pepper the film, but the character's rose-tinted musings on the country just about fall short of being completely offensive.Similarly, while the central characters play up to received and marketable British stereotypes, the performances remain cosily elegant. Wilkinson is effortlessly charming as the lovelorn judge, while Nighy ditches his usual slick and sleazy shtick and plays the role of the put-upon husband with surprising sincerity. It is Maggie Smith's hilarious turn as a brazenly racist old biddy, however, that really steals the show.Some films can make you laugh and make you cry, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel will probably just make you giggle infrequently and occasional sigh with sadness. It is a highly unchallenging piece of light entertainment, but a solid and agreeable film nonetheless. I look forward to watching it again, after my mum opens the DVD on Christmas Day.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
126,Queen_of_pentacles,Why India ?,5,10 July 2012,"Well, the city could have been any, as one can hardly identify the one shot here as Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan; No trace of those famous pink buildings, scintillating bazaars, women clad in colorful costumes and exotic jewellery. Instead, we see some ordinary men and women from city slum households.All the characters are miserable in their own way, some gay, some disgruntled with their status, and others totally confused as to why the hell they are here in India !i was amazed with the scene of Sunaina stripping her clothes in a jiffy, and getting into the bed of Sunny, for a quick sex at night, after riding her scooter with such speed,as if it's matter of utmost urgency for her ! We have yet to develop this kind of culture, where sleeping with the boyfriends in such a bold and brash manner is so easy in India.The script and dialogs are poorly written, with no consistency,or consideration for the main characters, especially Sunny lecturing all the time,with unending eloquent speeches, most unsuitable to his young age.The director is absolutely confused in his approach and understanding of Indian mindset and scenario. Right in the beginning, there are demeaning references to India in general, and Jaipur in particular.Towards the end ,however, the director has woken up to the fact, that so far, the movie has gone on haphazardly, with only series of events, and hardly any solid characterization. In fact, they could have been less, without making much difference to the already weak story line,or the lack of it.Some moments of tenderness, between the character played by Judy Dench, and Maggie Smith, how ever, redeem this film, from being crap.The musical score is mediocre, and does not linger, not even true to the haunting melodies of Rajasthan..That's why i say, why India ?These people could have assembled in any part of the world, for that matter.. but then how would the gay relationship between a British guy, and an Indian,most unusual, but nothing extraordinary, would have been shown ? It hardly evokes any tenderness on the viewers' part, in fact this angle was absolutely unnecessary for the plot as such.Hardly any purpose served by making the characters suffer through the heat and teeming crowds.. i really felt sorry for them! Pierce Brosnon's Octopussy was more authentic, and beautifully shot, in Rajasthan only, though on a different note, the filmography made all the difference.All the adjectives are in the title only.. no trace of them in the movie.. i have my apprehensions in recommending it ,even for a one time watch.. do it if you like, at your own risk of boredom !",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
127,iamyuno2,Huge Disappointment,5,2 January 2014,"I guess I'm going to have to be the one to disagree with the majority on this one. I went to see this film in the theatre, eagerly expecting something good. How could you not, with this cast - Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy etc.? But this, to me, was the most clichéd poor excuse for a feel good movie ever. In fact, I think it failed because it tried too hard to be a feel good film. Although my wife thought it was wonderful, I found it unbelievable and more like a bad TV sitcom than anything else. In fact, I have to believe the direction was sub-par because even the great actors in this film at times seemed less than believable...and seemingly guilty of poor acting (but that often occurs when the direction puts them in that place, where scenes are poorly thought out and perhaps the wrong ""takes"" were put in the film and not enough takes were shot in order to get a good scene). Also annoying - the Indian lead actor in this film, for my money, was way over the top...amateurish I mean, over- acting. And - again, to ME (because my wife liked it) - I disliked it because I felt this film had a sad geriatric feel to it. It was as if you were watching the famous lead actors when they were over-the-hill in a film that was beneath them. But I blame all that on the director and screenwriters. These are actors whose quality careers are not yet over. Only misdirection, a poor choice of takes and poor writing could make Dames Judi Dench and Maggie Smith appear anything other than what they really are - namely, (usually) brilliant actors.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

At age 60 I feel very much like the market Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is pitching to. The film skillfully pushes the right buttons for those who appreciate a blend of humour, pathos and the work of veteran actors like Wilkinson, Dench, Smith, and others.One of the nice things about Marigold is a scenario in which the incomes of those who are aging are not keeping pace with the style of living they had hoped to enjoy. Popular entertainment endlessly subjects us to depictions of the over-privileged, living in the world's mega centres. Wilkinson's character's story--a man on a quest into his past--falls outside the penny-pinching story line, which could otherwise have been too confining. Some side stories among the Indian characters add variety--albeit formulaic variety, when it comes to that of the young lovers.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Good script. Jaipur looks a treat and brings back memories of my time in India. I'd move to that hotel in a heartbeat even if the living conditions are not up to scratch. BUT of course what let's it down is the patronising, post-colonial cliches - the 'Manuel-Fawlty-Towers-like' young hotel manager etc. It's hard to overlook all this.

I saw the film yesterday in Paris in a crowded small theater and I hope it will move in a larger one as it deserves it. When I quote ""Passage to India"" in my summary I do it on purpose. Both films have this great understanding of what old age becomes. How to cope with a way of life which more and more is becoming less understandable for the elders. And also the difficulty to accept others culture because they look so strange sometimes and we are most of the time prejudiced by clichés we've been educated with. It's a good way to teach tolerance to youngsters for their elders as well as to others culture and civilization. The cast is superb. Good laugh, some teary eyes.

If it had been on telly, i would have changed channel,it bears almost no resemblance to the book, the jokes were corny and very 1970's. There was a section of the cinema who laughed out loud at the jokes, reminded me of theatrical laughter, staged, for effect. I was glad when they stopped laughing, as the film ran out of bad jokes, and meandered for a while. The side story of the sonny ans his girlfriend was good, and he was actually funny and interesting.

In line with the subtle humor and beauty of Room with a View (thought it doesn't quite reach that height of humor or greatness as a film). And, appropriately so with Judi Densch and Maggie Smith in a lineup together. This really is in line with a great run of British films since the 80's (Room with a View; Four Weddings; Notting Hill; Bridget Jones; Love Actually; etc., etc.). Densch's narration is exceptional. The actors are superb - these are some of the finest actors of this generation - and the writing is, though not brilliant, exceptional. Certainly better than 99% of American made films. The India setting is perfect. It is both modern and ancient and anyone who loves international cities will understand the love for this. I loved the film and love this genre. The film industry and movie world would be a better place if a well-done British film like this were put out every year. Having to wait three or four years for such films is just too long.

133,italo505,Better than any special effects,10,3 June 2012,"It's not very often that you get such wonderful Brits into one single movie. In The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel you get not just one or two, y﻿ou get all seven of them, one more brilliant than the other: Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie, Penelope Wilton, Judi Dench, Ronald Pickup and, last but certainly not least, Maggie Smith. But throwing star names shouldn't be the only reason to see Marigold Hotel, it's also the story that drives the movie: these seven retirees have decided for different reasons that they can no longer afford (or wish to) live their last years broke and lonely in England.Everyone except for Maggie Smith's character Muriel Donnelly who is very reluctant on going to the chaotic city of Jaipur, India where they're to perform a hip replacement operation which she couldn't afford or wait for. She struggles with her own prejudice, racism and misconceptions from the moment she steps down (or should I say wheeled out) the plane. This would have been enough story for an entire movie of her own but there's many other stories that develop between all seven travelers.It's also the story of Sonny Kapoor (played by the energetic and charismatic Dev Patel, from Slumdog Millionaire) who manages the run-down Marigold Hotel in a poor side of town and is trying to turn it into a desirable place for senior citizens to live. Except that nothing really works in this half star hotel from the plumbing to the air conditioners to the telephones. From day one we see how the guests struggle to get through the airport, scramble through the poor streets of India and its mad drivers. I think this movie, along with Eat, Pray, Love have prepared me mentally to when I will get to experience the chaos myself but until then I will sit comfortably while I watch people's reaction to the madness that's India.SPOILER ALERT: Little by little, the whole drama between them unfolds: there's marital problems, flirtation, depression, even a character's homosexual orientation is revealed in the most unexpected and maybe one of the most touching scene in the movie where this character (I refuse to mention which) gets to reunite with an old flame that never blew out. The scene almost had me in tears: to believe that someone lived his or her life repressed of those feelings for someone over fear of being rejected by their families or society. It's a very touchy subject that is treated with great respect and gracefully. The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a wonderful movie that is such a relief to see in a summer full of superheroes in spandex and special effects driven movie that lures you in with those pesky 3D glasses. I hope to see one or two names being called at Oscar night. Can we expect Judi Dench or Maggie Smith? Or perhaps Tom Wilkinson? You betcha!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
134,amahlanand,This is Everyday India,10,14 September 2012,"It is only clear how distinctively English one can be through mannerisms and actions when they are put in Rome and do nothing of what the Romans do. This serves as the icebreaker within the film for something which demands a little serious consideration. Having lived in India myself, I can deem this a film which instructs us precisely the same as what experiences in India do. Embracing old clichés rather than avoiding them like the plague, particularly the one which says to value what you have regardless of how much and what it is. And what a wonderfully warm, pleasant and incidentally humorous way the film chooses to do this in. I entered with great curiosity having been in a similar sort of situation myself once upon a time. Moving away from the West to a vastly different world that is India is a rude shock to say the least. Being overwhelmed by the rapid progression of life, the strange, the aweworthy and the humanity isn't uncommon. That side of India, the way a local sees it daily, is something worth sharing with the world. No work of Western cinema I have seen has truly succeeded in that endeavour although this has come the undisputed closest. Unlike 'Slumdog Millionaire' which dealt with harsh realities and unfortunate extremes, this iteration of India in Western cinema is more of an amiable recounting of how colourful everyday cultural life in India can be. It certainly differs from the overused 'starkly unique' tag which is often employed when depicting life in India. Much of the film seems to float away with many of the characters' experience of roaming the streets and assimilating the richness and distinctness from their status quo. Meander it may but it makes you genuinely feel in their shoes, experiencing the delights that our five senses can bring to us. And it is not only the way that the actors absorbed themselves into their roles in this environment but the way in which they blended together as a functional, reputable English cast albeit with colourfully diverse characters, that made the Holy Grail of acting, the ability to allow someone to see the world through your eyes, achievable. The film certainly takes a dig at some sects of the unfortunately unworldly elderly who have not moved on with the ages. Maggie Smith, for instance, can be terribly funny with some of her racist quips and unwillingness to leave England behind in any sense, not due to a sense of patriotism but moreso a sense of comfort. So too is Ronald Pickup, whose surname gives an idea of his goals despite his hapless lack of success. Yet changing perspectives is very much a flavour of the film. How isn't what I will divulge but know that director John Madden hasn't aimed to be tearjerkingly moving as much as subtly touching, an effect which can certainly be more impactful. When all is said and done, how we can judge the film is by questioning whether the characters that we can find it so easy to attach to find what they are looking for in their lives. This may not involve a clichéd happy ending but answers to their conundrums. And in some way, shape or form, in a strange, aweworthy or humanely way, India gives them this fulfilment. I may have had the benefit of relating to this through déjà vu, but I can guarantee that this is refreshing, light but simplistic. Moreover, it can be a little instructive but also pleasurably and amusingly illuminating about a whole different side of life.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
135,bonzybino,Celebration of life.,8,13 July 2012,"An overwhelmingly delightful and heartfelt English movie!! the movie is set in India where a group of English Old age persons come to reside and spend the rest of their lives, in ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" @ Jaipur. Things doesn't go well as written down and the ""Senior Citizens"" takes some toiling and blending to get well with the environment, and finally finding out the virtues and the privileges of ""living"". Its a celebration of life, the movie shows how the characters going through those emotional turbulence in the final phase of their lives gets over with it, each of them in pursuit of something better!I was a bit bothered with my ambivalence, never felt good about the poking, the satires, the dig at the Indian culture and ways - which weren't deliberate and must admit, very real. But then there were lot of enthralling moments to cover it up as well. The exotic & an equally filthy locale, the Indian mannerisms, the way of communication were all so perfectly rendered. A somewhat clichéd subplot in form of a mini bollywood romance ( Indian couple only) did irk me, and that too when the movie was catching its prime. An ensemble cast ( all of them known faces) makes sure the movie never gets over dramatic or comical - though Dev Patel who plays the young manager of the hotel was a bit goofy. Thomas Newman has composed the music well, so congruent a blend of Indian and Western.""Slumdog Millionaire"" was way too 'hinglish' for a British movie - still wonder how it got Oscar crowned - and a bit over-showing the darker side of India ( loved the movie nevertheless ). ""Darjeeling limited"" was way too comical, ""Outsourced"", a simple but brilliant movie was poor though, in content and visuals. Well, ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" in a way overdoes all these movies, yea it does have plot-holes, some instances melodramatic, some quite bollywoody! But you don't need to miss this movie, its a celebration of life.

Ironically enough I must have missed the part where they ""adapt"" because I cannot remember any of the characters adapting to anything in Jaipur, with the possible exception of Muriel (Maggie Smith) who appears to be slightly less racist by the end. Evelyn, for all her talks on ""adapting"" is the one teaching the locales about British telephone etiquette and customs. Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) also teaches the youths the intricacies of cricket. Norman (Ronald Pickup) finally meets a woman he likes in Jaipur... a British woman! Muriel proves to be a much better hotel manager than the natives... and ends up managing the joint. The movie reeks with imperialism which is surprising in the 21st century. The narrative is predictable to the extreme, there is no one single event/piece of dialogue/development that you do not foresee a mile ahead. There are more clichés per square minute than many stories I watched or read recently. Yes I am a bit intrigued by the fact that on Rottentomatoes.com and Metacritic.com the film appears to rank favorably with reviewers as well as with the general public. However I just happen to disagree with most of them and to side with one scribe who wrote of the colossal waste of talent amalgamated here. The reason I give TBEMH a 5 and not a 1 is the actors who absolutely provide their very best; but at the end it was not enough and Graham Dashwood expresses it in ways I can not possibly replicate: he dies of boredom.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
137,blandiefam,Nicely Executed bit of proper English fun,7,29 November 2013,"This movie allowed me to enjoy the concept of retiring and enjoying a strange land. I felt the heat from the Indian hotel as I tried to figure out why they made such a daring move. The British seem to have a more opened mind about the idea of adopting the lands of the former British commonwealths. The pacing of the movie allows us to feel the way one of great nobility would deal with retiring in a land completely different than jolly old England. I would see this movie again. The actors are all over sixty years of age but they play the part of people with heavy back stories and you become absorbed into the way they deal with such drastic change. The Indian actors seem a it over the top and the way that everyone in the land seemed so friendly kind of rubbed me the wrong way. Still, the vibration of the heat and madness which is India is well represented.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
138,paloma54,Superlative Cast & Interesting Situation end in Clichés (possible spoiler),5,11 February 2013,"My husband and I watched the first 30 minutes of this film with great enjoyment. After all, with this many top-notch British actors and actresses, who, by this time in their careers, are familiar faces for us, and the different premise from the usual British stories about India, who could not be hooked? However, as the characters' stories played out, the movie became increasingly hackneyed, in the usual juvenile, politically-correct ways Hollywood loves.For example, one of our characters emerges as the kindly older homosexual reunited with his erstwhile Indian lover, with whom we are predictably expected to sympathize and admire. When his story ends, we are then thrust into the middle of two other pseudo-love stories.One is the (ho-hum) triangle: wonderful kind husband married to tiresome inflexible and also unbelievable cold British stereotype wife, played thanklessly by Penelope Wilton, who is falling in love with wonderful Judi Dench. How obvious is that. A some rather flimsy pretext, the plot involved the inconvenient wife simply ending a 40 year marriage in a minute of plot-time, to return to England for a divorce, thereby leaving the story free for a happy end with Judi Dench remarrying.Worst of all is the very horny and seemingly empty character unrewardingly played by Ronald Pickup. What a total waste of talent! The fact that the scriptwriter or director or whatever is so interested in the plight of one elderly man to have great sex again reveals a sort of emptiness or pandering which we found disgusting. Not that we think it's disgusting that he wants a few more nights of passion in his life, however, I find the fact that there is nothing else to this old man after so many years of life, awfully boring, if not downright insulting. Can the writers not imagine that there is more on the mind of the elderly than sex and work? Maggie Smith's character enjoys a complete transformation, made only somewhat believable by her extreme talent. We still had a hard time with this neatly-contrived happy ending.Celia Imrie is wonderful, but doesn't get much to work with. And there is an excellent tiny cameo performance by Liza Tarbuck as a nurse/admin near the beginning of the film, whose snorts of disgust are delightfully amusing.All in all, we came away very disappointed, and wishing the cast would be hired again with the same premise, but this time, a 6 hour mini-series written perhaps by Julian Fellowes, who has done such a superb job with Downton Abbey. You could also hire the writers of Foyle's War.The UK has so many talented actors, all screaming for decent written material.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Each took their familiar roles such as a feisty Judy Dench, a thoroughly decent Tom Wilkinson, a xenophobic Maggie Smith and all played well. It just needed Juliet Stevenson, Julie Walters, Hugh Grant and Helen Mirren to appear in cameo roles as substitutes at half time. India also put in a stunning performance. The problem was the predictable script which began to drag after a good first hour. Bill Nighy could have ditched Penelope Wilton far sooner and saved about ten minutes. I kept feeling that I had seen the film before especially with all the actors playing in familiar positions. It was all too neat and everything came together all at the same time. A couple of other things didn't work either. I know it was supposed to have comic aspects but Dev Patel's stereotype might even have embarrassed Peter Sellars. However the most incongruous moment was when Maggie Smith suddenly revealed herself no longer a senile old nanny who used to manage a household budget but someone who could glance at a set of accounts and instantly assess a hotel business.

A business model suddenly appears to have been very profitable from the start. A mother suddenly appears to have been in the same situation as one of the leading parts. A business venture unexpectedly delivers so much profit that a first class travel is an option. It seems like a multi-episode TV-film turned into one feature film, skipping the necessary build up.

142,TinyDanseur27,I might just have to travel to India now!,7,25 June 2013,"I had only seen one preview for The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. I was drawn by the all-star British cast and the apparent humor. I mean, who doesn't love Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, and Bill Nighy in comedic roles? It didn't really occur to me that 90% of the cast of the movie was over the age of 60 until I showed up at the theater and I was younger than the majority of the audience by at least 30 years. We felt a little out of place but it mattered not in the end. The comedy and heart-warming nature of the film made up for any awkwardness I felt sitting in the theater. It was a laugh-out-loud kind of film. Dev Patel, whom most people know as the star of Slumdog Millionaire, delivered a splendid performance as the over-enthusiastic dreamer who owned/ran the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for the Elderly and Beautiful. The dialogue was witty and the all British cast were perfect for their roles. There's just something in the way these British patriots of the film industry act that adds a quality to the film that is unique to their culture and experience. I love British flicks!The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel was located in Jaipur, India. In watching the film, one gets a glimpse into the chaos, beauty, poverty, and culture of India. It really fascinated me. There was just so much life there, so much color. At the same time, it looked like you'd be in constant peril of being either pick-pocketed or run over by a motorbike. Never-the-less I really loved spending the 124 minutes that I sat watching the movie in India. I haven't seen many movies that take place there; I think just Slumdog Millionaire and Eat, Pray, Love. All three of the movies make it seem like an amazing place though, amazing in the sense that it's completely different from everything I've ever known. I find that intriguing. India has never been at the top of my list of places to travel but now I'm not so sure.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Take a disparate group of people, put them in a similar setting, throw in a few minor incidents in the plot, have one of the main characters die, and you've pretty much figured it out. The only major differences between TBEMH and FWAAF are the characters and the setting. Others than that, if you've seen one, you can easily skip the other.It's a pity that such talented actors such as Dame Judy Dench, Dame Maggie Smith, and Tom Wilkinson are wasted in this.

This decision obviously involves a physical journey but more importantly, an emotion journey too. Gradually we learn the back story of these characters, and these stories are very fascinating indeed.An absolutely stellar cast are well served by an intelligent witty script with some killer one-liners which are guaranteed laugh out loud. Only occasionally does it get sentimental, but somehow this doesn't matter, because the seductive nature of India weaves its spell not just on the characters but also on us.

What a writer of fiction can only do is re-visit the themes, because, as common place as love and heartbreak seem, the first time they happen to you seems like the first time they are happening in the history of mankind.And this movie grandly, sweetly, gloriously, and charmingly captures the uniqueness of predictability that befalls the human suffering. And the cast. What could be said of a cast that hasn't been said before?

From the opening scene right through the closing credits, I was riveted to my seat wondering how the heck this whole situation (the plot) would work out.There's plenty of crisp dialog, a good portion of it absolutely hilarious. Yet the director managed to get everyone back across the line into some quite sober and serious situations seemingly without effort. I guess having Tom Wilkenson and Judi Dench in your cast (among all the other wonderful cast members) makes it almost easy.A bonus here (for me) was how well Dev Patel (the hero in Slumdog Millionaire) worked with the rest of the cast.

151,pensive_englishman,Absolutely love this show,10,21 August 2020,"Before watching this film I didn't believe I could write a review on movies like this simply because comedy isn't the type of movies that triggers my soul. I'm more of a serious and pensive person like Old Rose in Titanic (1997) who at time enjoys reflecting on reality and exploring deeper meaning of life. Yet only a short moment into this show did I realize I must review it.This show turns out to be not just a comedy. It is a drama as well, a visually stunning, substantively rich and philosophically resounding drama.A group of British retirees resettle in a vastly culturally different country - India for various reasons. Some come for more affordable retirement, some look for their first love, some venture for casual encounters, yet some seek medical treatment.Life is such a journey, isn't it? You get people on the same (metaphorical) boat which in this case is the over-promised yet under-delivered Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Yet people get off at different destinations. Some die. Some leave for their home country. Some meet their new love. And some find accomplishments in their new local life.The idea of settling in a different culture from your own is quite something to fathom, especially for people at their retirement age. This is even more so when you move from an industrialized world to a third world country. Yet such things do exist despite being definitely not for me. There are Australians who look beyond the border to retire in Malaysia or Thailand. Well I believe people all have their own reckonings.There are a lot of unsightly scenes in this film, be it dilapidated hotel, crowded bus, chaotic traffic and impoverished household, which obviously are not conducive to happiness. Yet it is exactly this visual and cultural shock that make it a success. After all the world does not only consist of wealthy countries.On the host country side and probably on a side note it is interesting to see how a country transitions from a traditional culture to modern values. This cannot be more vividly expressed in the fight between arranged marriage and free dating as experienced by Sonny the hotel's young owner. The Indian culture of having a large and extended family living so close and closely as witnessed in Maggie's carer's family is a fascinating contrast to the individuality in the western world.As to cast and crew Dame Judi Dench doubtlessly stands out as the highlight. She is definitely more than a 007 lady. And she is so English and so British that I thoroughly enjoy her taste and class. And some of her narratives are truly worth reflecting. ""But it's also true that the person who risks nothing, does nothing; has nothing. All we know about the future is that it will be different. But, perhaps what we fear is that it will be the same. So, we must celebrate the changes. Because, as someone once said 'Everything will be all right in the end. And if it's not all right, then trust me, it's not yet the end.'""Overall I love this film as it blends thoughts with laughters.

It's what happens when you mix wonderful veteran actors with a script that hits on every romance plot cliché and then some -- forbidden love, the passions of youth, old players learning new tricks, etc: hot + cold = meh. You might have been lead to expect wonderful cinematography at the very least, but there again, you'll get unremarkable; some passable shots of the colorful urban folk of India and a few overhead swoops above trains in the countryside.

153,bhaveshbhatia,The movie is for the celebration of life which cannot be missed!,7,14 September 2012,"The movie The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is set in India. It's the story about a group of old men and women with a love for life. The movie is a landmark for director Madden and also for the great group of British legends.The story is a great mix of comedy, romance and high-voltage drama. Impressed with the advertisement, seven old Britishers, living on their pension, decide to spend the rest of their lives in the retirement home for the old at Jaipur. The group includes Judy Dench (Evelyn), a housewife who realizes the monetary debt she has to live with after her husband's death; Tom Wilkinson as Graham, a retired judge of the High Court, whose not only motto was to stay at the Hotel during his visit to India, but also a deep dark secret that he was holding close to his heart; couple Douglas and Jean played by Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton respectively, who lost their retirement benefits trying to start up an internet company for their daughter; Madge (Celia Imrie), an ageing beauty who is still on the lookout for a rich husband; Norman (Ronald Pickup) who is looking for THE girl who wouldn't call him dirty and old; and Muriel (Maggie Smith) is a fussy xenophobic ex-housekeeper, who has decide to get her hip operated in India knowing that the same would be shelved in Britain. Other than the fantastic seven, we also have Dev Patel as Sonny Kapoor, who plays the role of the manager of the Marigold Hotel.They are greeted by surprise as they enter the hotel. Not all was as exotic as advertised. What was advertised as the dream hotel from the British Raj, the hotel was far from being complete. The rooms are incomplete and most of them do not have any telephone and some of the rooms are already inhabited by pigeons. To make matters worse, they encounter the ever-day-dreaming manager Sonny and his mother (played by Lillete Dubey). However, they decide to stay. Only Norman is not disturbed by the ruckus around him as he is hell bent of finding a girlfriend and nothing could stop him. There are some funny moments in the movie. For example when Norman is seen reading the Kama Sutra with utmost dedication; it reminds us of the fact that the old have a thing or two about sex as well. However the movie deals with the emotional turmoil of every character. The most notable is Judy Dench, who is vulnerable and stoic at the same time and does not back away from trying new ways to seek happiness. Her chemistry with Bill Nighy is noteworthy and one of the most memorable moments of the movie is when the couple roams around the streets of Jaipur in a motorbike. All the characters have done a noteworthy job in this movie. However, the one actor that stands out is Penelope Wilton, who essays the character of an old woman dying to be listened to but lacks attention and audience is a class apart. The movie, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, is a movie that breathes a fresh lease of life in both young and old. Set in the beautiful locales of Rajasthan, the movie shows new ways of living life to the fullest even when the days are numbered. It teaches us an important lesson – old age may not always be imposed by Nature; most of the time it is a state which is imposed upon us by the circumstances surrounding us. One does not need to be young, but needs to feel young at heart to enjoy the gift called Life. Madden's masterpiece ""The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"" is the celebration of life which cannot be missed.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
154,barryweir,Utterly refreshing in an age of misery,8,21 July 2012,"It has been a while since I sat down and enjoyed a movie for what movies were created for - to entertain. I laughed, I cried and I felt satisfied when the end credits rolled. I felt I had been fulfilled. I can't remember the last time a movie ended and I felt like this.A lot has been made of the fact that this cast is in their 60s and 70s, and that somehow indicates that it is for a certain generation. On the contrary, I found the movie can appeal to any age. I, myself, an 34 years old. I find time beginning to creep for me, but in now way feel that I cannot accomplish things in life. Yet, even with my relatively limited lifespan compared to the lead characters, I found the performances and script able to perfectly translate to me the emotions and feels of these individuals, and the frustrations of life not quite panning out as we would like. This movie is not just one about age. If anything it is not about age really at all, it is more about how you live you life. How you manage love. How much you allow the past to constrict you. Indeed, in Tom Wilkinson's finale scene I couldn't help deeply feeling the character's sense of release as he feels love again for someone he has been kept away from for so long (having been in a similar position myself).I won't bother to talk of the cast. You know when you see this list of names that you are going to get assured performances. But it is not just the older cast members who are good, Dev Patel gives a great performance and is the source of a great many laughs. A perfect vehicle with which to show that he is an actor with range beyond Slumdog Millionaire.There have been some comments so far criticising the treatment of India in this movie, suggesting that it is portrayed as dirty and backward. The movie doesn't really do that if viewers keep their eyes open. Indian is both modern and traditional, with people of both persuasions riddled through society. What is portrayed here is not against the norm. But, really, it's the vibrant colours and wonderful vistas that make India and welcome star and not a ramshackle, dirty place. You do not leave this movie feeling that it's place to avoid, rather the other way around, that you are reminded that it is a place of magic and wonder to be explored.If I had one criticism, it's that some of the story lines lines were a little underdeveloped, most notably Maggie Smith's character, who undergoes a change of personality a little too quickly in my opinion. By these are minor complaints because most of the time your mind is busy considering the issues the movie raises so you don't really spend too much time worryring about an less believable bits.Anyhow, I could go on forever, but then life is to be lived so I better get out there and start doing it.

Like the line for entry to heaven, there was regretfully the odd young person in the audience, no doubt terrified at the prospect of leaving their life behind to sit with all the oldies for what might seem like eternity.But fortunately The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is a charmer and even the youngest viewers will find something to enjoy here. Whether it's Bill Nighy, again stealing the film from under the noses of an accomplished ensemble (see also Love Actually) or the sweet love story of the films only younger characters, the film has enough unexpected moments to mask the more predictable and clichéd elements of the story.When seven British retirees opt to 'outsource' their retirements to cheap and cheerful India, they arrive at a hotel that is not as expected from the brochure. Dev Patel's Sonny runs the place under the watchful eye of his disapproving mother and the visitors are left to dust off the furniture and make do with the cockroaches on the floors and the curry served up every dinnertime. The stars of the movie are delightful; Judi Dench does vulnerable but determined; Bill Nighy funny and heartbreaking; and Tom Wilkinson quiet, reserved and struggling with an unexpected burden. It is a story of seven characters facing up to a new time of their lives with new challenges and new loves presenting themselves. It is a hopeful story about letting go of the past and embracing the future.Like any film set in the country, India is a central character. The colours, the faces, the smiles, the sounds, the hustle and bustle of the packed streets all assault the senses, not just for the characters but also for the viewer. You might see less of the real India than many would like, but it is always present in the background.The love stories are touching with the ups and downs of relationships sensitively written. The unwinding of Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton's Douglas and Jean is particularly well handled and bound to induce the odd tear once the inevitable finally happens. Wilkinson's search for a lost love is concluded a little too conveniently and lacks the emotional gut-punch it could have. But all the characters get their moments in the spotlight; whether it is bigoted old racist Maggie Smith's opening of her heart to the locals or Ronald Pickup's desperate search for a last bit of nookie (ahem sorry meaningful connection).The elderly members of the audience loved it, laughing heartily from the opening moments of Dench on the phone to her internet service provider. More unsettling was how many found Maggie Smith's Muriel and her hideously outdated racist comments at the beginning even funnier. Hopefully the Daily Mail readers, like Muriel, will come away from the film with a slightly enlightened view of the world outside their doors.Overall, Dench and Nighy are the standouts, but Wilkinson also gets a strong storyline in a film chock-full to the brim with colour, joy, a little bit of sadness and hardship and a lot of hope. Just like India itself then.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
161,clouseau-4,Just simply wonderful - go see this film!,10,13 May 2012,"This is one of the best films I've seen.It combines a wonderful cast with an engrossing story, and I became quite attached to all the characters due to their sublime performances. I've always enjoyed Bill Nighy, ever since ""Underworld"" and he was excellent in this as well. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith also give stellar performances but the entire cast was uniformly excellent.The movie is not a comedy but it was very funny in many places. In the packed theater I was in (I think I was was one of the few there under 50) was often roaring with laughter.The film also did an excellent job of building the back story about how these different seniors all ended up in the same hotel in India. Dev Patel was a bit over the top, but I think the love story involving him worked well. That part of the film was not as strong as the bits dealing with the British characters.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

163,jasarthur,"Best film in years in the ""Enchanted April"" genre",10,15 January 2013,"I have recommended this to the parents of all my Indian piano students. When I say, I just saw a great movie set in India, they all ask, ""Life of Pi""? My daughter saw Pi and thought it was a bizarre, godless, weird, gruesome, existential and pointless movie. But The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is completely the opposite. The scenes of India are stunning and a major part of the overall experience. One mom told me they were going to rent it but saw negative reviews. I couldn't believe it! How jaded and soured can people be to not enjoy this movie? I'm not even going to read any of the critical reviews. They'll just anger me. If you liked Enchanted April, see Exotic Marigold. The story is wonderful and uplifting, the acting (despite what some people have said) is top-notch, the cinematography and editing is excellent, and my whole family (3 adults) thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
164,bfinn,Bland & forgettable,5,9 May 2012,"On the plus side this film is set in beautiful locations, well shot, and gives a fairly realistic impression (from a tourist's viewpoint) of visiting an Indian city. The thing I enjoyed about it most was reminding me of a trip I made to India myself.On the minus side, I found the script was weak in various ways: the humour is so gentle as to be barely perceptible. The characters (partly because there are quite a few) are sketched pretty thinly, such that you couldn't really care much what happens to them.And the events are predictable and clicheed: a elderly East Ender starts out racist but eventually she's turned around. The hotel is going to be sold and knocked down, but shortly afterwards it's saved. The young manager wants to marry a girl who his mother disapproves of, but a few minutes later she relents. These events are trotted out in a perfunctory fashion; nothing is surprising or interesting.And while undoubtedly it has a star-studded cast, this isn't exactly Shakespearean material to work with, so you could hardly call the performances memorable. It's like the London Symphony Orchestra playing a jingle.So a humdrum, mildly entertaining, instantly forgettable throwaway film. But don't take my word for it - watch the trailer; like most trailers it includes the 'best bits', and if you don't find it particularly hilarious/compelling, the same will probably go for the film.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

166,SaranshTMF,"bad direction, dull, boring and...Dev Patel !",6,25 June 2012,"what looked like a promising adventure turned into a sore experience. sure it looks good on papers but it is quite the opposite just like the hotel itself (ironically). its a story about bunch of old people bored with their life and looking to spend their retirement years in India. Started off quite slow (first 10 minutes) but the moment they set foot in India, thats where the fun starts and is the only watchable portion of this film. After that the graph kept on going downwards. many little stories kept brewing up which at the end of the film, leave you asking, what this movie is actually about? Although its shot in Jaipur and characters keep telling each other that they visited this temple n that place. Their is amusingly not even a single shot of those places and Jaipur as a whole. Dev Patel, probably the worst acting performance i'v seen in any movie and is the major downfall of this film. Rest of the cast did a fine job. only thing apart from that portion(enjoyable one) is the autobiographical notion added by Judi Dench. very bad direction and all in all a very boring, confusing and forgettable movie.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

N secondly, Dev Patel.- i just couldn't digest the maniacal manager he is playing ( every time he started blabbering n sycophantic at the foreigners, i was feeling this odd out of place sensation) - close to aversion but not exactly it......Well besides these 2 issues the movie has got a nice story n fresh location for us to enjoy :-)",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

169,filmcritic3,British ensemble cast shine,8,17 May 2012,"THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL I must admit I have a weak spot in my heart for British light drama films. They seem to combine just the right amounts of pathos and laughter to carry a story. Admittedly, as I advance in years, I'm more prone to appreciate the ensemble casts British filmmakers tend to utilize. When you place John Madden at the helm, you have a winning combination. Madden became the darling of English departments across the nation with his SKAKESPEARE IN LOVE, and presented an engaging thriller of aging spies in last year's THE DEBT. Now, he fronts THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, and it's a marvelous anecdote for anyone in or nearing their senior years.There's currently an urban legend making the internet rounds about an old man who is a greeter at Wal-Mart. He does his job exceptionally well, but often comes to work late, sometimes by as much as 15 minutes! The store manager, a young fellow fresh from school says to the old man: ""You do a marvelous job when you are here. You are, in fact, our best greeter. But, I have to write you up because you have this problem arriving late to work. What did they say to you when you were younger and came late to work?"" The old man looks at the young manager and says: ""They said 'Good morning, Admiral. How would you like your coffee?'"" I relate the story because it is the basis for THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. Seven seniors find themselves kicked to the curbside in modern day British society and attempt to rediscover some type of usefulness in an advertised luxury resort in India. The luxury resort, however, is not all the brochure and advertisements promised.After thirty years of public service, Douglas (Bill Nighy) and Jean (Penelope Wilton) were hoping for a comfortable retirement. However, after Douglas fronted his daughter their retirement money to launch an internet business, the only flat they can afford is far below Jean's standards. She blames Douglas for not ushering her into the lap of luxury to which she feels she is entitled.Evelyn (Judi Dench) is a recent widow. With her husband gone, she realizes she has never led a life of her own. Without her husband, she is lost and has no idea how to live, until she discovers the wonders of the internet. She finds a kindred spirit in Douglas, much to Jean's chagrin.Madge (Celia Imre) is staying in a lovely home with her son and his family. Unfortunately, she is constantly pressed into service as a baby sitter for her grandchildren. THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL offers her a chance at living her own life, so she takes it. Similarly, Norman (Ronald Pickup) is a widower with a college boy libido. He is instantly drawn to Madge, but it is apparent to both, they are not going to blend. Instead, they help each other in their quest for happiness.The British have always enjoyed a cultural empathy with India. While some view the history of the two countries as imperialistic, others are cognizant of the metamorphosis the two cultures experienced, both to the betterment. Muriel falls into the former category. She despises Indians and their country and is not at all pleased with the cultural blending that has occurred. Through her adventures at the hotel, she will learn, despite traditions, people basically have the same dreams and desires, as is modus operandi for scripts of this nature.Finally, there is Graham; a superior court judge, he was born and raised in India and found his one true love there. Now, after 40 years, he is returning to confront his past.All of the vignettes, and the characters they embody, are tossed together in THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL. The hotel is not the best of salad bowls. It is run by Sonny (Dev Patel), who inherited it from his father. Sonny is the youngest of three brothers and has yet to make his mark on the family. He is madly in love with Sunaina (Tena Desae), but she is from a different territory and social status, eliciting the ire of Sonny's mother. If he can just make the hotel work, perhaps he can appear as successful as his brothers and win his mother's favor. Unfortunately, the hotel is nearly as decrepit as its residents.To tell this tale, Madden pulled several key crew members from THE DEBT, including writer Ol Parker and cinematographer Ben Davis. He complimented them with Editor Chris Gill, who is best known for his work on the zombie flicks 28 DAYS LATER and 28 WEEKS LATER, and musical scorer Thomas Newman, who wrote the melodies for two FIST OF FIORE AWARD WINNERS, American BEAUTY and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.Thrown into the main plot is a subplot, jabbing firmly at Indian telemarketers. If only these folks were as keen as Evelyn would have them be, and not chained to those ridiculous 12 minute scripts.THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL will not track well with younger audiences. There is no bathroom humor and while sex is hinted at, no one really wants to see a geriatric sex scene (that line probably upset Alex Baldwin immensely). The film should track well in Pittsburgh. The city's population is ever aging, and young, wealthy conservatives making money opt not to live here where the tax structure is socialist in nature. For anyone who has hit and passed 45, THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL will provide an enjoyable, humorous drama, without the brainless entertainment values the Net Generation craves each and every weekend.THE RATING FOR THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL = B",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Maggie Smith as the racist elderly patient, sent to India- ""outsourced by the NHS for a hip replacement "" (may happen soon !!!LOL ) was superb.She stole the show with her crusty portrayal of an elderly white woman who hated all things foreign- doctors, the food (if I can't pronounce it-I don't eat it !!) etc brought snickers to the whole audience,and set the scene for mayhem for our group of retirees embarking on a new life in hot,overcrowded India, with promises of a better life at the Exotoc Marigold Hotel - where the elderly were respected .

172,u_sims,Funny if over Hollywood-ized comedy drama in India,7,19 April 2012,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is based on the 2004 novel 'These Foolish Things' by Deborah Moggach. It stars Academy Award winners Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, as well as Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Celia Imrie, Penelope Wilton, Ronald Pickup and Dev Patel in an ensemble cast. The premise of this British comedy is 7 British retirees travelling to Jaipur in India to spend their retirement in a seemingly luxury hotel for the 'elderly and beautiful.' However, it is actually a rundown former hotel run by the unsuccessful and down on his luck Dev Patel. Soon the exotic and palpably different Indian culture begins to grow on them, despite the British ambivalence towards India (do we love 'em or hate 'em??). There were a few embarrassing moments when the cinema audience laughed at excruciating racist remarks which were supposed to have had them writhing in their seats; still it's a mark of how prevalent racist attitudes still are amongst some classes. Each character is developed well, most notably Maggie Smith's wheelchair-bound character, who transforms from a woman constantly making racist remarks into someone who starts to accept the foreign lifestyle and particularly the unique charms of India. There were uncomfortable moments when the depiction of poverty seems to have been the sole purpose of the film's message, but on the whole I found it to be a gentle and sympathetic portrayal of the country. The script was mostly clever and very well written with many funny and wry jokes slipped in. The acting was also great, with all the actors on top form, all of them playing their characters well and how they are meant to be. However, despite these positive points, the film's length could certainly be felt at times, and I found it a little boring in its two hour running time. Also, the romances were overplayed and displayed a Hollywood style touch. Overall, a witty, well acted film with surprising emotional punch from pretty much every major character and a feel-good element to it.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
173,SilkeJ,Everything will be alright in the end,9,1 August 2014,"I wasn't sure whether I wanted to see the movie or not. I'm so glad I did. Not only do all the actors fantastic, but the story is engaging and entertaining. It shows how a preconceived idea can be turned on its head, how opinions can change, and how life will generally throw you a curveball when you least expect it. The setting was great and honestly, it makes me want to go out to India and open a hotel lol. I haven't read the other reviews, but saw a few that gave low ratings. I don't know why, because the movie really doesn't deserve anything less than top marks. I particularly enjoyed Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Judi Dench's parts, and the Aspirin bit...

174,sayloroct,Better in concept than in execution,6,23 July 2012,"The theme of the movie is, of course, second chances. And Who wouldn't love a story about second chances, especially among a bunch of exiled seniors, and especially when the seniors were the likes of Maggie Smith, Judy Dench, Bill Nighy, etc. Unfortunately, the story was better in concept than in execution. Or perhaps it was just that my expectations were too high.The first half of the movie develops fairly slowly. Then things change quickly in the 20 minutes. I hope that Maggie Smith, and some of the other cast members did not get whiplash from having their characters change direction so sharply in the last 20 minutes. I've never seen a characters change direction so fast so quickly as Lillete Dubey and Penelope Wilton (playing a character even more annoying that the one on Downton Abbey) in the blink of eye. I've never seen to many plots so many subplots tied up so neatly, so quickly. The real fun of the movie was watch Dev Patel do his optimism shtick, but much of the rest was fairly mundane.Lastly, the movie certainly failed at one level. I certainly didn't convince me that India was a place that I would ever want to go.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Despite this, they discover something about India, about themselves, and about ""life in general"", most notably that the approach of death need not mean that life is on the wane.The playing of the leads is uniformly excellent, and even Maggie Smith's racist housekeeper and Penelope Wilton's frigid wife are sympathetically played.Judi Dench, providing an improbably omniscient narration, has never looked more luminous and the Indian locations are beautiful. I've never been to India, and met few Indians beyond those who wait in Indian restaurants in England, so I'm unable to rebut criticisms that it deals in stereotypes, but the thrust of the film is about what life holds for those of a certain age whose family or career purpose has been taken away. I think I appreciated it precisely because I'm close enough to such a prospect to begin to wonder the same: what will I do and who will I be when I retire and my family have flown the nest?Thoughtful, amusing, satisfying, and much better than the poorly- conceived trailer that heralded it. Cinema can still be for the oldies!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
176,ravik-kant,A very good watch!,9,30 March 2013,"This movie reminded me of another movie named Outsourced. One major difference being Outsourced had an American crew, whereas this one's got British. I had loved Outsourced and I loved this one too. Very high on emotional front, this movie talks about 7 old age Brtishers who had to come a small time hotel named Marigold in Jaipur to spend last few days of their lives.With the actors like Judi Dench, Celia Imrie, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson and Bill Nighy around - it was never going to be low on acting department. The only point to see was - how does director go about portraying the fusion - something which was very nicely done in Outsourced. Movie scores amazingly there. The movie expectedly is shot around Jaipur and the characters are quite special in themselves. There is one Gay in the movie who is retired High Courte judge, one lady who hates Indians, a couple who have spent 39 years together only to know that they have been humble and kind to each other rather than in love, and then we've got Judy Dench portraying the character of narrator of this film.This movie brings the essence of India and how a foreigner should look at it. Its a different country with different values and culture. It was heartening to see the same being displayed with utmost honesty on the screen.Well, there are certain flaws as well. Indian love birds, however modern they might be, still don't kiss in public. Indian hotels, even though meant for old age people are better maintained than what's show in the movie and the pieces attached to technology, as displayed in the movie, is poor. One can blame it to Jaipur city as its not as developed as, lets say Delhi or Mumbai or Bangalore, but the place does look little outdated India.Another thing movie missed out to cash on was its festivals. There are hardly any captured. Director, I am sure, must have been in dilemma of showing Tajmahal or larger cities. It seems he compromised on glorifying the movie at cost of character development - something that I think was quite appropriate. Its not necessary to show Tajmahal in every Indian movie.With all the positives and negatives put together, this is one fantastic piece of art which I simply loved for its truthfulness.It garnered positive review upon release as well and stands at 78% at Rotten Tomatoes and 7.2 at IMDb. I guess those ratings speak very little of what this movie is. I am no fan of Slumdog Millionaire, and this movie is no where close to it, thankfully.It comes highly recommended from my side.

180,Unbilled_Role,"Some Very Fine Moments, But it Needed to Dig Deeper",7,26 May 2012,"This film explores what happens when 7 British retirees come to India, seeking love, restoration, changes, and escape. Some of the reviewers have done a good job providing the synopsis, so I will bypass that task. I agree with others that the country of India is one of the stars, with it's teeming life, vibrant music, electric colors, and a dash of eroticism and the divine. The film could have gone farther, though. Some of the bustling city scenes resembled some typical travel photos I've seen of India. One of the film's most graceful moments was when a character ceremoniously enters a river.Most of the cast was in fine form, particularly Dench, Nighy, and Wilton. But the tone from Dev Patel was a bit off. He is a fine actor, as seen in Slumdog Millionaire. For this role, he was over-the-top. This offers easy comedy, but it lacks nuance. The responsibility for this lies in the director's hands.This film was engaging and brought laughter and a few tearful moments to the audience.

181,accercel,"""Orientalism"" at its best",3,23 March 2012,"John Madden's film is not a comedy, but rather a fine example of good old ""Orientalism"". Seven retired Brits go to India, to the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"", to spend the ""autumn of life"". British (financial) conditions do not allow them to be relaxed in the last years of their lives, but India does. One of them is a bigot, but in India she will denounce her bigotry (not explicitly though, we are just left to guess that). Another one is a widowed housewife, who will nonetheless manage to find a job in India. All the Indian characters in the movie do is to depend, one way or another, on the Brits. Without the latter, the former are nothing. The owner of the hotel is a young Indian apparently with no skills for business. Eventually, it will be the former bigot caretaker (!) who will become the hotel's assistant manager, and thus save it from ruin, something that the young Indian manager was of course not able to do. He is even quoting Kipling: the colonized is hence truly admiring the colonizer. His lover is a graduate student working in a call center, the typical outsourcing job characteristic of the economically colonialist relationship between the ""West"" and countries such as India, yet this is presented as the ""modern India"". The former English housewife, who never had a job in her entire life, will end up teaching the young call-center workers how to proper speak English with their customers. (After explaining to the manager of the call-center what ""to dunk"" means: if colonialism brought English to India, only post-colonialism gets to such linguistic nuances). Tom Wilkinson plays a retired judge who comes to India in order to see his former (gay) lover. The nostalgia of the good old times of the empire is blatant. Yet the movie goes further than that: the former gay lover had an arranged marriage, yet both his wife and himself were happy with that, leading a tranquil and relaxed life. Really??? Last, but not least, there are some romances in the movie: India is rejuvenating the retired Brits (once again, an expression of the imperial gaze upon the colonized, perceived as bringing life to the aged empire), but no inter-ethnic romance is present. Retired Brits go to India to find some other retired Brits and fall in love again. Mingling with the Indians is done only in order to patronize and explain to them what life really means, be it in terms of market economy or romance. An intellectually obnoxious experience.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It was absolutely perfect - outstanding acting from every member of the cast, and a wonderful script that made me (and the rest of the audience) laugh out loud repeatedly. Funny, moving, interesting and able - as so many films are not - to make its points gently, with humour, and, praise God, without preaching at or haranging its viewers. No coarse language, no violence, and I left with a huge smile on my face. I can't remember the last film I saw where the audience burst into spontaneous applause at the end.And I politely disagree with those who say this is a 'grey film' for elderly people.

I was very pleasantly surprised. It was different from the usual schlock that Hollywood pumps out, and calls ""comedy"". The exotic scenes of India are just stunning to the senses. British acting and comedy is just so superior to any other. Dev Patel was hilarious as the inept ""Sunny"", the irrepressible hotel manager. The 'racist' element some previous reviewers have mentioned was handled perfectly , and maturely. An Indian couple sitting next to me in the theatre were laughing all the way through. If only Hollywood could handle racial issues in the same adult, mature, humorous and inoffensive manner. At the start I suspected we might be offended by a barrage of political correctness, but there was none. Do yourself a favour, ignore the critics , delight yourself, and go see this movie.

At first, i was overwhelmed by the cast but it turns out they managed to do their part very very well.

The movie was a mixture of adventure, culture and obviously fun.
It is highly recommended.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
187,info-21405,Heartwarming Story with an AMAZING cast,10,20 July 2020,"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has an intriguing premise: for varying reasons (and with varying expectations) a group of British retirees all make the same decision to move to Jaipur, India to live out their years. (One note: the movie is based on Deborah Moggach's book, originally called These Foolish Things, but it is quite different).With that premise, there are many potential storylines and that is where this movie excels: there are MANY amazing actors in this movie, all perfectly cast into roles that are subtle, unique, and heartwarming. I found myself liking each and every person--even the ones who are struggling with the move to a new country.There are too many superb actors and too many storylines to share here, but what I especially appreciate is the honesty of the characters and their stories--while the movie is heartwarming and positive, not every outcome is ideal or perfect. Just like in real life, people are flawed and tragedy happens and lessons are learned.I consider it a must-watch.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
188,janet-f,If you are really old you may love this,8,28 May 2012,"Well, I am 28 and did not find much to connect to here. The visuals of India were superb, and so evocative. The scene shifts briefly from Jaipur to Udaipur, and since I have been in Udaipur, the part of the film that was shot there brought back wonderful memories. There is also a grand old restaurant/bar in the film, presumably in Jaipur, but evocative of many similar establishments in India.I had spent some time in official government offices when I was in India, so I can say that the scenes occurring in the public records office ring absolutely true. Oh, and so good to see one of those Indian phone-answering services from the India point of view.The characters, however, are a bit too one-dimensional and follow a predictable script. You have to suspend belief to think that they could change long-held patterns of thought and behavior in just a few months. The wife who never became even slightly accustomed to India seems like the only realistic character, but the script writers (or maybe the original novelist) do not take a very kindly attitude toward her. I personally know many more people who are like her than who are like the other characters.To me, the retired judge with a secret was the most memorable character, and the viewer gets truly caught up in his life.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
189,mgorman-6,"Pleasing movie, visually compelling, great actors",7,5 May 2012,"Eight aging Brits respond to an online hotel brochure that brings them to Jaipur, India, where their pounds will go further, and where they can pursue unfulfilled dreams. Imagine Eat Pray Love with a grittier, more realistic focus on the chaos and jumble of life in India as backdrop. Like Eat Pray Love, the problems of the lead characters revolve around love, mainly coming to terms with how they have managed their relationships so far, but also about the possibility of starting new things despite being past middle age. The story of these British pilgrims intersects with that of a young Indian man who is reviving the hotel that his father once ran, with too little capital and competence, and who is on the other side of the aging process, trying desperately to establish his manhood so that he can escape maternal constraints and marry the girl of his dreams. One is occasionally reminded of Slumdog Millionaire, which also featured Dev Patel as the young hero, particularly when the Bollywood music kicks in. But the resemblance is only a passing one. There is nothing to compare with the best British actors (minus Colin Firth) working as an ensemble. Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Tom Wilkinson et. al. take perfectly adequate writing and moderately predictable plot twists and invest them with passion and pathos. Maggie Smith has the toughest task, in the form of an embittered and prejudiced spinster who must come the furthest in terms of changing her character, all within the relatively short time span covered by the movie and without leaving her wheelchair. Anyway, Marigold is entertaining and diverting, though maybe a little too facile if you think about it too hard. But don't, just enjoy the journey and the view.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
190,kneazles,Wonderful film!,9,26 June 2012,"I suppose I need to start by saying I'm in my mid-twenties. I watched this film with my boyfriend (same age), and my parents who are both retired.The result? We all adored this film -- I think more so my father than any of us. As a traveller and ""black sheep"" of his family, he loved the idea of a bunch of retirees going on a one-way trip (all expenses paid by the hotel) to India to live out their retirement days in sunny weather, exotic locales and new foods.The film doesn't try to mince what its characters feel -- they are snobbish, racist and fed up with the way things went with them.Individually, there are several stories that the film briefly starts in on to give the audience an idea of what each main character is like before India; once they meet at the airport, though, they start to form cliques and groups and enjoy each other's company.This film ranks with ""the Bucket List"" and ""Secondhand Lions,"" telling its viewers to enjoy life as it comes; we can slave away at a job for countless, thankless years, but it's what we make of our life -- before, during and after -- that really make us who we are. This film highlights that with its characters (and not just the elderly!). Even Dev Patel's wonderful work demonstrates his character's issues, determination and worries that young adults everywhere face.Give it a chance -- you'll laugh, you'll cringe... but at the end, maybe you'll understand.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
191,rveight-251-982372,A delight but could have been much better,7,30 June 2012,"***No may about it. Lots of spoilers***There is a lot that can be criticised in Marigold Hotel. The story was weak, there were plot holes and the innumerable sudden changes in the characters were not supported by the script.Maggie Smith, always excellent, took her part as one would expect, but even she struggled with the change from horrid racialist to something more normal after just a visit to the home of a staff member. The same problem occurred with the life-changing moment for Dev Patel's mother.We really could have done with Tom Wilkinson's reason for going to India explained in more depth. It ended up little more than a bit weird.The change from Lothario to sympathetic new man in the time it took Celia Imrie to visit the loo was a big stretch of the imagination.There was also an overlying air of the self indulgent. One came away from the film with the feeling that it had been written specifically to give old British actors a job.It is probably one of the most predictable films since Titanic. There can be very few who expected Dev to lose the hotel and once Maggie Smith told us her previous role we all knew she would be at the accounts.However on the plus side we had the beautiful scenery of India, superb acting even given a script that was less than perfect, a gentle pace which suited the story precisely and, most importantly, it was a feel-good movie par excellence.There were some classic moments. Maggie Smith's script gave her some shocking lines early on. There were some delightful one-liners, unfortunately not included on the quotes page for this film. There were some subtle times as well which were entrancing.What the film did not do was to demonstrate what it is like to grow old, and almost impossible feature in a feel-good movie. So I'm glad it did not even try.I would have preferred it if the film has focused on perhaps one or maybe even two of the residents of the hotel and developed their characters. We were left not so much wanting more information as needing more. Judi Dench was almost two-dimensional, so a bit of a waste of her undoubted talents. The same went for Bill Nighey, Tom Wilkinson and the other guys in the band.Reading through this review I find it rather more critical of the film than I intended. I enjoyed it. It was two hours of gentle humour. However I feel it could have been so much more. It is well worth seeing as the vast majority of people will enjoy it.Can one grade a film on black of fulfilling its potential? I think 7 out of 10 is reasonable given the faults but a little harsh given how delightful the film was. With a little bit more work it could have reached nine.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

First 25 minutes were great but then I don't know what happened...India wasn't really involved they were background actors, only highlighting two people who were doing things Indian society would not accept. I feel like they used India for their beautiful idea and set but didn't really care to actually involve India and it's real culture, it's real people. Instead we marched in made a bad movie and marched out.
Sad, what a waste of two great actresses and an excellent idea.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
193,juliewriter,A Coming of Age Senior Story - Like Petals of a Marigold,9,26 June 2012,"This movie is fun! Marigolds are a variety of colorful flowers, some are tall,some short. Likewise, the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel has multiple enjoyable story lines and social messages. First and foremost, this wonderfully entertaining movie is like a coming of age movie for seniors who may believe the best years of their lives are behind them. Not so! When a group of English seniors seek value in their retirement years, they independently find themselves drawn to an internet ad for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, in India. Anyone who travels in Asia will relate to the plot, the culture shock of living in civilized England compared to an exotic India resort - it's a surreal transition, to say the least. Yet, the plot is so superbly acted by the entire cast, (starring Dame Judy Dench as the lead Mrs. Greenslade with Maggie Smith as a principle character Muriel Donnelly) it doesn't take any time at all before we're transposed into one or more of the story's characters and fantasy our lives as aged baby boomer's through them. But, this isn't only a story about baby boomer's - there's something in the plot to satisfy all audience ages. There's an especially enjoyable love story between a beautiful Indian couple who yearn to shed old world social norms to find happiness in a marriage that's not been pre-arranged but based upon their mutual love. This is a best of India movie, the old and the modern, juxtaposed over a coming of age story about seniors who are too young to give up on living life to the fullest. This should be a 10 star movie, with Maggie Smith giving an Oscar worthy performance. But, I give it a 9 because the plot thins about how Smith's character Donnelly comes to realize how she can make change happen for the better and save the Exotic Marigold Hotel from bankruptcy. This is a terrific movie and a sleeper must see hit!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
194,erikd71,Everything will be alright in the end,7,4 November 2012,"""Everything will be alright in the end"", the quote that is essentially the message of the movie. This is an obvious feel-good movie about Brits deciding to spend their pension days in India. But as an obvious feel-good movie from a British perspective about different cultures coming together, it's also actually quite honest.Overly optimistic and romantic? Absolutely. But it does gently touch on some of the issues and it can give you a little bit of insight in the Indian culture. It even serves at being a gentle mirror on our own cultural inadequacies.The acting here is fantastic and the characters are well written. Especially the British characters are very believable. The Indian characters seem to be a bit written from a British perspective and mostly serve as vehicles for a feel-good flick. But even so they are entertaining, well acted and well realized within the confines of what this movie is about.Personally, I really did enjoy this movie. It won't give you a complete picture of India, but it does give you an honest point of view from a certain perspective. And as such it entertains and inspires.For what it set out to do, it succeeded admirably. Recommended.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
195,denquixote,HOW do you feel about plagiarism?,8,21 July 2019,"There are so many lines in this movie (or a variation thereof) that I have heard before that I wanted to scream. However there also is a great deal of originality and very little predictability and for that I am grateful. The performances are uniformly excellent which comes as no surprise considering the caliber of the actors. Another nitpick: An actor has the same (uncommon) last name as some of the characters. Am I alone in my dislike of this little factoid? Another nitpick: One of the characters is named Norman Cousins without any apparent reason for the author to have chosen this name. It's as if he has never heard of Cousins, the author. It must be a chore making up names but isn't creativity supposed to be one of the hallmarks of good writing?",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
196,PurpleAlbatross,"Two Important Don'ts: DON'T miss this movie, and DON'T believe the critics",10,26 February 2012,"I agree heartily with all the reviewers here (except ""disappointed"") because this is a GREAT BRITSH FILM for which the critics have not given hardly enough credit. I am glad I didn't listen to their ""disappointment"" and went to see it anyway. Sometimes it is critics that are the disappointment! The acting was tremendous. The setting of India was beautiful and perfect. The theatre was full and as most people have already said here, everyone was laughing out loud. It was like a great and funny and cleansing session at a cinema/therapist,that just washed over you, so touching were all the emotions and insights, so real to life ,you could not believe they were acting.I read one newspaper critic who said the characters didn't have enough depth. Well, no, it was a two hour movie, silly, and what you got was a vignette of 7 real lives, each of them facing the reality of old age in their own way.How wonderful to have a real movie about real issues that addresses them with humour and leaves you feeling uplifted. And how refreshing to have a film by and for the mature and senior members of society. To me the whole idea and effect of this movie is to fly in the face of the Western idea we have of old age somehow being something pitiful, to be feared, and if possible, to be glossed over, fixed up and avoided, so you can remain as young, powerful and appealing to your very last day, as possible.The movie opens up all these ideas to question and I am sure left many, like me, pondering. Why are over 60's in this country called Old Age Pensioners, when no self-respecting American would allow that? They are ""Senior"" Citizens over there(note the difference). Why don't we look after and respect our elders? Why does the extended family work perfectly well in countries like Italy, Spain, Greece, India, but is a rarity here? And who is responsible for ignoring or marginalizing a whole generation of baby boomers who lived through and oversaw one of the biggest transformations in society ever? They were the generation that believed in a Brave New World, and many of them still do.A society that doesn't value the wisdom and experience of its elders is without foundation.Young and old,""every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the whole"". Go and see this movie and think about it. And take your family. Great stuff.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
197,jamesantoniou,"Very pleasant throughout, but as good as what you'd expect from such a cast",7,8 March 2012,"Marigold Hotel was overall a very pleasant film with a distinct feel-good factor - helped by the vibrancy of the Indian setting. Judi Dench is excellent as always, and Bill Nighy really captures the child within for this film. In fact, all of the cast were superb, although Dev Patel suffered from a little overacting! The plot is more like a moral, and explores a 'young at heart' theme throughout. I think the vision of the film is somewhat confused at times. It seems to shift from a full-on comedy to a film about ageism, and it doesn't flow as well as one would hope. Also, Maggie Smith's character (although superbly played) is a slightly far fetched transformation, so I would have liked to see more focus on her throughout the film. Overall though, a nice, entertaining piece of work. Perhaps not as good as you would expect from such a star-studded cast, but nevertheless, very entertaining!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

There is a little bit of everything in this movie, from a gay old men, singles, widowed and others, but all don't want just to end up as old people in an elderly care place, but want to make something out of their lives.I also think this movie is a bit too long, in some parts it get a bit too long, but I would not say boring.I enjoyed Dev Patel and the picture of India also.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

What a waste of time and money. An immature script filled with clumsily placed, secondhand one-liners and characters of no depth whatsoever. The only interesting character, whose story alone could have made a film, is killed off halfway through the film, leaving a sorry collection of aimless plot lines lazily trying to tie themselves up with some semblance of believability. Sorry to say, too, that the Indian actors had very little screen presence, except for the long-lost gay man, who was good without even speaking a line.This was also one of those films in which you could tell exactly where the deleted scenes would have been, thanks to some very slapdash editing.

200,karen_ga,A totally unexpected treat!,9,4 April 2013,"I wasn't expecting anything special when this popped up on my TV guide, but it sounding a little bit intriguing and I was kind of bored. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be a major understatement. This film is a gem. 7 British citizens at retirement age, variously facing adversities such as surgery, loss of income, boredom with life, among others. This disparate group all plan a trip to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in Jaipur, based on that hotel's brochure. Upon their arrival, they quickly learned that the first class trip and first class hotel have been exaggerated just a bit. One of the guests previously lived in Jaipur, and is able to help the others navigate Jaipur, literally and figuratively. As with any movie shot in India, India herself is part of the movie and it was colorful, beautiful and loud, but enchanting. The hotel is not at all what they expected, but Sonny, the young man running the hotel, is bursting with enthusiasm at what it could become at some point in the future.Each character is finely drawn, and exquisitely acted by the very talented ensemble of Tom Wilkinson, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Celia Imrie, Judi Dench, and Maggie Smith. Each finds their own happiness by the end of the film.This is a different kind of love story. A love of new lives found, old lives given up, love between a young couple whose parents disapprove of their relationship and finally, the love of the country they initially only intended to spend several days in. Happiness found, friends lost and more happen in the space of a couple of hours. I can't write exactly what I felt, but I watched it again the next day, just to be certain that it truly is a remarkable films. For those film critics out there that panned this movie, all I can say is relax, and enjoy life a little bit. It won't hurt, and you may find room in your hearts for one of the thousands of movies made each year that are not Oscar worthy, but are made to entertain a jaded public, and give them a little break from their normal day.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
201,greenday840,A Slap on the face of Danny Boyle,9,5 February 2013,"Before you go ahead and blast this review all guns blazing, i am a big fan of Mr. Boyle. I enjoyed Slumdog Millionaire as a movie. Being an Indian, the movie did project the underbelly of India, but was more or less offensive. If the Academy wants to give all awards to movies which show a slum and poor people, then they should encourage their filmmakers to make more movies about poverty in the U.S.Again, this review may be considered as a defence to my country, but India has a lot more to offer than slums and gangsters. This is what "" The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel "" captures which Danny Boyle was just not able to. The Flavour of India, as it is known is on full display. With seasoned actors, and accomplished director and a good script, the movie is thoroughly enjoyable. The scenery and the picturesque location is expertly captured. You may start believing that this movie was made by an Indian not John Madden.The story is about British Retirees travelling to India for a vacation which turns out to be a life changing one. Each character is well defined and the story unfolds at a brisk pace. The locales of Jaipur are extremely well captured and it was heartwarming to see our country presented in a picture it deserves. The scenes where Tom Wilkinson plays cricket on the streets and rides in a rickshaw stand out.Well, when you have two Dames in the cast, the expectations increase and they do not disappoint. Bill Nighy as charming as ever, Tom Wilkinson acts like only he can. Dev Patel irritates as usual but is sort of necessary in the picture.Though the movie might not appeal to everyone, it is highly recommended for people who saw Slumdog and thought India was a one dimension country.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

But it was worth it - also necessary since the theater was jam-packed. And not just with older movie-goers either. The entire audience applauded at the end of the film - not something that happens often in sophisticated Manhattan.The performances were so true and wonderful - just an amazing cast, starting with Judi Dench who looked glorious. The humor was delicious but there was also recognition of some of the sad realities of life at an older age.All in all, I will happily see it again.

Don't look for fault, don't go in with exceptionally high expectations but just enjoy this film for what it is.

It really is the most entertaining, colourful and uplifting film I've seen for a very long time. Apart from India itself - which is a star in its own right - it is the performances from this stellar cast that really make this movie. At times it was like an acting masterclass, but never at any time could you see the cogs turning. The central characters were all wholly believable, and to be honest I find it impossible to single anyone out, although if I had to, my vote would probably go to Bill Nighy. He is just superb as Douglas - the apologetic, hesitant, henpecked husband of the self centred, bitter, scolding Jean portrayed by Penelope Wilton, who is also excellent. There is one particular scene between the two, where Douglas, for once bites back - and the emotion from Nighy is just mesmerising to watch. When you add the likes of Dames Maggie Smith and Judy Dench to the mix, the delicious Celia Imrie, Tom Wilkinson and Ronald Pickup (with an honourable mention to the latter, who brought a wonderfully rakish comedic performance to the mix) - and you can't go wrong. The younger cast members and all the supporting players do an excellent job - but it is the oldies who steal the show. That doesn't mean it's an oldies film - far from it.

206,ifredpr,Sadly disappointing by Ivette Fred,3,11 July 2012,"The movie is not that good, unfortunately. It was highly recommended to me by a friend and I was disappointed during the entire film. It is very superficial and unbalanced, it shows for long the supposed British prejudices while does not show enough how Indians are, present them as talking English on the streets which is not usual, it treats premarital sex and romantic love between young people of different backgrounds in a very light way, and highly underestimates the prejudice and rejection Indians have for homosexuality. Kissing is not common on the streets for heterosexual couples. Physical affection is widely exhibited in public like holding hands, for example, but among heterosexual men who are the ones that occupy the streets. Dev Patel's acting was regular. The best part of the film was the acting of the great British actresses Judi Dench and Maggie Smith. No surprise, of course. And the insinuation of problem solving collaboration and friendship between people of the East and the West. I do not recommend it. It is plain, too romantic, thus, simplistic.

We saw this film in an older downtown theater in Hingham Massachusetts with an audience of mixed ages although all adults and probably a older than the average audience for a movie not aimed at kids. The performances were great. While a comedy the attempts to deal with things like the problems of becoming old and the financial troubles of seniors were cleverly slipped in as were issues of class and sexual orientation.

This movie has all the ingredients for a good film, but these ingredients need to be properly mixed and baked. As it turns out, this is nothing more than a cliche travel-log flick with a worn-out albeit camouflaged theme and uninspired acting. I may be the odd-man-out in this, but I'm of the opinion that a movie has no raison-d'etre unless the audience can care about the characters on the screen (favorably or otherwise). I could find no reason to care about any of them, so after a half-hour in front of the screen I cut my losses and shut the darn thing off. This movie has been rated favorably alongside such film as 'The Good Karma Hospital' - I think not!! Same part of the world; totally different result.

Over the past 40 years the ship has fallen into disrepair and is barely recognizable. Cruise Director Julie McCoy & Isaac (the Bartender) Washington's love child, young Sonny, dreams of rehabilitating the old boat and bringing happiness and love to tourists' hearts once again. (While he is a cute young man, with a role similar to the Vicki character in the TV series, Sonny has an annoying habit of speaking in run-on sentences with minimum length of 400 words.) Gopher makes a brief appearance in this made-for-TV movie, and poignantly passes away after liberating his conscious of a burden he'd been carrying for decades. (No wonder he was always such a grump on the boat.) None of the remaining original cast could take time off from their current jobs to participate in this production. The producers couldn't find any American actors who would touch the script given the limited budget and flawed story line, so the roles of all the passengers are played by washed-up British actors who, given that their characters are all forgettable stereotypes of two-dimensional old fogies, ham it up in an effort to capture the attention of the viewer. Like any other Love Boat episode, there is no real plot to speak of, just some lovelorn singles and couples who predictably find love - or at least come to understand their hearts - over the course of a very long stay on board the ship. Sadly, this tribute film is only a pale shadow of the TV series. It would have been much better if only they could have found Doc to reprise his role. If for some unexplained reason you miss watching Love Boat, full episodes are available on YouTube.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Story does add a gay Indian guy and an Indian couple involved in a premarital relationship (something not still accepted by the Indians in general). It was funny for the first 15 minutes and I thought the initial bitter taste of poverty and other problems will be graduated to sweet taste of India as a philosophy/religion powerhouse(remember Indian is birthplace of many religions) or at least it will play a role in the story. Nothing of that sort happened, story and India never met, they kept on moving like the two banks of a river.As a person born and raised in India with rich religious and spiritual values(I don't know how much I imbibed) I don't think this movies even touches the true spirit of India.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

I found myself wishing that I could meld with the characters on the screen and live their experiences with them. The entire cast was outstanding in every way, bringing their character to life in such a realistic way that you forgot they were acting. I will see it again and again. I gave it a ten-star rating on IMDb, but that wasn't a high enough score as this movie is off every scale and can't be rated high enough.

Unfortunately the talented performers only emphasized the amateurish mugging of Dev Patel's performance which I found distracting whenever he appeared on the screen. I found it unrealistic that all the main characters would stay in a dump once they arrived in India. The movie was overly long due to poor editing. It seemed like the same conflicts were being play over and over. Some of the conflicts, especially between the young Indian lovers, were too conveniently resolved to be plausible. A better script would not have had a voiceless character pop up at the end to finally speak and tie up an important conflict in such a neat manner or have the hotel's future resolved so conveniently.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
218,nitinbajaj,Brilliant cast and writing makes you forget the clichés!,8,22 June 2012,"If you have a to see a feel-good movie this year, make it this one. The all-star ensemble cast is a who's-who of British greats: Dame Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy, Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup, augmented by the relentlessly energetic Dev Patel. The plot, such as it is, is based around a bunch of Brit pensioners who, for varying reasons, end up in a raj-relic hotel in Jaipur as long stay guests. While the standard clichés of the ""foreigner in India, initially struggling with the dust and flies and poverty and noise and finally embarking of a successful journey of self-discovery, after accepting India for what it is and going with the flow"" genre are all present, it is the performances and the dialogue that make this movie work. Dench and Wilkinson are consummate practitioners of their art and you can see why; Maggie Smith, Nighy and the rest are exceptional as well. Fantastic!",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

If they are in the UK then they probably watched the film at a free viewing like I did, as it hasn't been released yet, and they have no right to slag it off seeing at it cost them jack. Once it is released to paying customers, I can assure you that this score will go up considerably.The title can be a little off putting but anyone who has seen ""Fried Green Tomatoes At The Whistle Stop Cafe"" will tell you that a daft title is not a precursor to a bad film. Far from it.I came out of the cinema exhausted. The range of emotions this movie drags out of you, and the speed it does it, is incredible and I have to thank the scriptwriters and director for that. It is a while since I saw a movie that made me laugh out loud so much and so frequently. Dev Patel's character is one of the most likable you will ever come across but then all the characters, bar one, have characteristics that just grow on you.It's a shame that Ronald Pickup and the beautiful Celia Imrie aren't shown on the poster as they are just as responsible for the enjoyment I got from this film as the other ""more famous"" members of the cast.This is a great film that will have you crying and laughing in equal measure but in the end will leave you with that really warm feeling inside that you get when you have just seen a classic.Do not be put off by the title and ignore the current score this film has until it starts to get up to at least an 8.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

The cast were fantastic! I love Celia Imrie, Maggie Smith and Judy Dench. I have never been a fan of Bill Nighy but am now a convert. And who can forget Dev Patel, my how he's come on since his days of being in Skins! The story lines were acted superbly and I fell in love with all of the characters for different reasons! The setting of the film was inspired and showed India as it should be, it has in fact made me want to visit there and experience it for myself.The storyline that I identified with the most was with the gay man meeting his long lost love again, I was in tears at that point! In the cinema everyone was roaring with laughter exactly where they should be, its like everyone in the cinema understood the film as much as the people they were sat next to! As you can see my review writing needs a bit of work, but I just wanted to hammer it home that this film has to be seen! I will be buying it on DVD as soon as its released!

We all loved the idea and promise of moving to a new and different environment. The actors are superb, totally inhabiting their roles. There is gentle humour, and very clever conversations. But for the over 60s in our group of film goers there were some inescapable questions. Who would provide health care, indeed how would that be paid for in the absence of an NHS? What if one choked to death in the dust and fumes? And none of us could see the point of having the youthful love interest, except that it felt somehow contrived as if to balance out the oldies. All in all, a really nice film, but on voting likely to appeal rather to the older generation (a pity) so not a high scorer all round.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

When I went to see it, I found a movie with much humor but also much warmth, human understanding and positive philosophy on the best way to live life, all told with a great sense of tenderness for human foibles. While it clearly is aimed at an older audience, younger audiences too will learn much from it if they pay close attention. The different characters are deftly drawn so that you know them as quite distinct individuals. Their stories or backgrounds are most important to the outcomes, so paying attention right from the start is crucial. Since the plot has been well summarized elsewhere, I won't waste time on doing that again but simply urge everyone to see this film for the life-lessons it imparts.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

A few words to those whose favourite movie actors are 'pretty' and soft focused in closeups and who fumble and mumble their way through their script, and who possess less talent than a stuffed dodo; Watch this film. Watch it to see a catalogue of the cream of British acting professionals offer a flawless lesson in their craft. The line up includes two Dames (Judi and Maggie), plus Penelope Wilton, Celia Imbrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup and Tom Wilkinson. These folk have acted week after week, decade after decade since their teenage and it shows! They make the whole 'bitty' business of film performance look effortless. My own definition of acting is 'rehearsed spontaneity' and these marvellous actors-- if the director requests it-- can produce take after take of precision delivery. A quivering lower lip from Penelope Wilton, for example, can bring on the goose bumps. The minor players are well cast and are a worthy match for the seasoned veterans. This film has charm, warmth, wit and wisdom in abundance. Technically too, it is well crafted and the overall 'feel good factor' at the final fade-out, is 10 out of 10 and I hope the awards flood in.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

What a waste, as they had the opportunity to create something quite meaningful out of the lives of older people who are down but not out. All the back stories were weak and unbelievable, and the Maggie Smith character was by Les Dawson, out of Rose in Upstairs Downstairs!I'm not sure what they were attempting here, but the end result was trite and negated any idea that older people are interesting.

This felt a little bit too contrived at times, but, what the heck, it's a movie and the ride that this film provides is well worth the suspension of belief that's necessary to be a participant for 2 hours.The cast - This is a pretty impressive collection of talent asked to portray a fairly varied group and they all deliver, even Dev Patel as the often hapless hotelier.

Saw this with a group at church one evening and everyone enjoyed it. Spoiler alert!! The scene when Graham finds his long lost love is beautiful. And it was really wonderful that the family of his long lost love insisted on him having a proper Hindu funeral. Not for everyone though, but just about everyone there that night liked it. Love transcends all cultures and genders Each of the people in the movie was there for a different reason, but in the end, they all show just how much older people can do with the skills they have learned by living. Spoiler alert!! They all come together to save the hotel from closing. I am happy to have learned they are making a sequel to this movie. I eagerly await it coming to a theater near us. Even if they are going to have some American actors in it, I still think it will be a good movie, especially since it is being done by the same director and most of the British actors will be back. I do not recommend many movies to people, I mostly keep my opinions to myself, but, this movie is a special little gem of a movie and I readily recommend that all the older people I know go see it.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

You only need a slight change of facial expression from any one of this selection of the world's top actors and it speaks volumes. This is a film about the inner worlds of the characters and their relationships. How they relate to the others and how they relate to their 'pre-retirement' lives. What has satisfied them? What has left them searching for more? And what can they find in the here and now?The colours and life surrounding them in India gives all of them a challenge - are they embracing their future or running from it? This is a challenge we can all take away and think about.

It's worth watching and having some good laughs and also some hints about the immigration problems in the U.K but with a funny twist to it. Highly recommended.. The story also surprised me, to be a good comedy needs to make me laugh, I wouldn't go that far, but there's so much more on this movie, retirement, regrets, and how to deal with love when you are old. Definitely, worth trying get some popcorn and good company. There's also some good famous actors from the UK. So That's my first review and I'm struggling to write more than 10 lines.

233,smithtyler1963,The Characters!,9,18 July 2015,"Well, this movie is quite something, I'll tell you that. The start of the film is just amazing, introducing us to the main characters. You have characters in every film, but the films I most love is where there are multiple characters from different walks of life, most of whom have never met each other before.So there's Evelyn, Graham, Douglas and Jean, Muriel, Madge and Norman. Norman was my least favourite, despite providing some comedic moments. Madge was slightly more entertaining, but with a somewhat...lacking personality. Douglas and Jean had such a difficult relationship, and even though I felt forced, their part of the plot was the most entertaining which included my favourite scene. Graham was great, and originally I thought he would end up with Jean, but it was revealed he was gay and then he died. Of a heart condition, not because he was gay. Muriel was my favourite character, because she had the most personality. She was relatable, realistic and sharp. It was great watching her, and Maggie Smith's portrayal was absolutely perfect. She drew me in from her first line.Evelyn, however, was the protagonist, narrating the film in parts. We went on a journey with her, and explored her emotions. Like Muriel, and Graham, she had a prominent back-story which elevated her character and made her more popular with audiences, including me.Then there was Sonny, owner of the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. He was funny, had a girlfriend who was also a great character, and an unbearable mother who made me hate her when she came on-screen.Overall, I just love the characters and cannot praise this film enough for a perfect mixture of brilliant storytelling and amazing acting.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
234,mmcguffin2001,Wonderful comedy for grownups,9,27 May 2012,"An excellent cast makes a wonderful script really work. An often funny story of retired people from England traveling to India to spend their 'golden' years. Each come for a different reason; personal, medical, financial. Each adapts, embraces or rejects a totally different culture than they're used too. In the end, as somewhat expected, the differences are not that great.The film does capture the contradiction of modern India. An emerging economic nation with strong social and cultural traditions that are not easily changed. These subjects are touched on lightly and not in depth, but seems appropriate for the tenor of the film, which is upbeat, hopeful and often very funny.No matter your age there is life to be lived.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It was too cute by half, working too hard to make us love its wholly unlovable and stereotyped characters. From the beginning the film worked its way diligently through a series of clichés. The Indian characters were the tired old caricatures which I hoped we had got beyond. This has to be Bill Nighy's worst performance to date. He looked uncomfortable throughout. It was a horrible waste of Maggi Smith's and Judi Dench's talents. The script was laboured and strained hard to be amusing but on not one single occasion could it raise a laugh or even a smile. My partner urged us to leave halfway through but I stuck it out to the end to see if would get any better. It didn't. The end was not only totally predictable but stomach turning.

But ultimately forgettable once you seen it once, and let down by overacting from Dev Patel and, in particular, some very hammy stuff from the dreadful Bill Nighy. His range of mannerisms and expressions seems so limited. Will avoid his films henceforth. The rest of the cast are excellent, particularly Judi Dench, Tom Wilkinson and Celia Imrie. However I found the Maggie Smith character transition from bigoted racist cockney to compassionate humanist a bit far-fetched. Apparently the book is far better at depicting in more depth and understanding the burgeoning problem of an ageing population.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

I saw it at a matinée today, and at 46 years old I was the youngest in the theater by about 20 years...uh oh...I was worried. But, turns out older peeps have taste. And what a joy for them to finally see real, meaty, vibrant characters their age in a contemporary movie. Characters who are still living life to it's fullest, starting over...interested in sex?! For me, it was a wonderful adventure. The movie opens with Judi Dench and she sets the bar high. She is truly one of the most effortless actors of our time - what a pleasure to see that all the other actors in the film rise to the occasion and create a brilliant ensemble. The writing is perfection, the direction is a challenge - there are a lot of story lines to juggle - but it delivers -with one scene flowing seamlessly into another in a natural progression that makes total sense. I thought I knew where this film was going about six different times but I couldn't have been more wrong. Deep,insightful, layered characters, the colorful, fish-out-of-water-backdrop of India, and a brilliant story all add up to one of the best films of the year. I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who said that this will be released on DVD soon, No way.

A must watch!,9,21 May 2012,"Well, it was one of those days when I had nothing to do and I just walked into the cinema theater without having a clue as to what this movie was about. It was a pleasant surprise indeed. The movie describes seven beautiful characters who are contemplating their retirement options in India. The characters had multiple layers which peel off elegantly as the movie progresses further. Especially touching was the character of Graham who had left last time with shame and guilt. He wanted to meet his love and goes on an excursion to find him. Well, most of the movies that describe India either elevate it to a degree of reverence or completely abolish it as the country of endless poverty and stench emanating out of every nook and corner. This movie was none of them and it showed India as it is, a land that is trapped between dreamy and determined youth budding to take it forward and the old cultural heritage that is impossible to refrain from. It shows a confused India, which is absolutely true given the present day scenario. The characters want to live, to love and to be loved but they do not have a lot of time.

The contrast between these characters and the youth starting life on their own is presented in a way that makes me look both forward and back on life. I'm in my mid 50's and already have a disdain for radical change in life. I do however accept if life continues changes come.

At one point I whispered to my wife is this we have to look forward to? A visit to the cinema every now and then to be reminded our dreams were never fulfilled? The film has some laugh out loud moments but isn't a comedy by any stretch of imagination. The comedy is about real situations and you'll recognise the incidents as having happened in your own life. India is portrayed as the place of happy smiley people living in poverty contrasting against the modern buildings where the likes of our British companies decided to place their call centres because wages are so low and they can make even more profit whilst making our own workforce unemployed. We get what we pay for, and the price of the ticket to see this is worth any penny as you believe in the characters and want them to enjoy their retirement in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. Personally I don't want to retire to India but the way things are in the UK retiring anywhere in 8 years' time seems out of this world at the moment.

248,colingreig667,3 actors steal the show,8,12 February 2012,"I managed to see an advance screening of this film today and I must say, Dench, Smith and Nighy are just WOW! Smith doesn't have much on-screen time with the rest of them, but her portrayal of an offencive racist (from the second you meet her on screen and the advertisement, so no spoilers, I promise) is perversely superb. Dench is Dench, what more is there to say? Her amiable, loving persona, hidden behind the stubborn front that Dench plays so well, slowly starts to crack early on, leaving you free to really bond with this character. Nighy on the other hand. I have never found myself to like any of his work. I find him ""samey and lamey"". This however, really opened my eyes to how fantastic an actor this guy is! He was one of my favourites, I really felt I bonded with the character, so well done Bill. The superb relationship between the cast and character is phenomenal, and if you are a fan of Brit Comedy like Brassed Off, 4 Weddings or the Full Monty to name a few, then this is worth a viewing, it really made me chuckle and warmed the heart strings at the same time.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
249,goboldlythrone,Great Story,8,16 May 2012,"I offer first that the story development was great. Here we have an ensemble cast older actors. This was enough to draw me out to see the May 15, 2012 screening in Oklahoma, USA. I love these people and know they will do a brilliant job with whatever they are given. And, what they were given was wonderful! I've read a few reviews which suggest that the character development was weak. I offer that it is actually strong. I am able to answer the questions of who the characters are, what is their situation, why they are in India, why they are experiencing India in the manner they are, what is behind each action...It is GREAT character and story development. The film is tight. The film is lovely! Everything has said this movie has been out for months but I've been anticipating it for MONTHS and we just got a screening. Please! See this movie. I offer too that the film really is beautiful. Every set and the entire experience of India is felt and seen.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
250,connielinkinpark,This is one of the very extraordinary movies that I've ever watched.,8,14 September 2012,"It chooses a special group of characters (English seniors were gathered in the Marigold Hotel), special setting (exotic place-India, which is not the usual place for retirement or vacation) and special topics (For example, gay love among elderly). These are not the common movie topics that young people will feel interested in watching.Unlike the young ones, these seniors not just come from different backgrounds. Each of them bears a very unique past and has gone through most part of his/her life. Some elders bear regrets of the past. Some are having ambivalence in marital relationship which has been turning sour. They planned to go to this exotic place for some sort of consolation. Some believe they can stay young and look for new excitement from date and sex to color the latest part of their lives. And Muriel, the phobic towards men other than the whites, was ""forced"" to go to India for hip replacement surgery .It's interesting to see how these seniors react to the new environment. Graham tries to find his past lover who is an Indian. Evelyn finds a job while she and Douglas enjoy themselves by going around and explores the exotic lives in India. Madge and Norman actively find new partners. Muriel initially get extremely nervous and skeptical when get in touch with people, food and places with the Indians. But she later develops trust toward them and adapting fully into the place. Even Jean, who is the wife of Douglas and seems to be the most unadaptable person in the hotel, whining and resenting about all the things in the place, has taken one step to find love in Graham(though fail in the end). And while these elders are finding new meanings in their late lives, the youths are also going through their era of dreams, doubts and fights against fate and authoritative care from guardians. The two story lines are intertwining with each other perfectly.We used to think that youth is the time for experiments, adventures or even rebellion. We'll find ourselves standing on Sonny's side, supporting him to invent the business in running the hotel and fighting for true love instead blind marriages arranged by parents. On the other hand, old age seems to be a time for a retirement, rest and stability. Terminating a long lasting marriage, ending a widow life and experience a new relationship, changing from being a retired housekeeper to a hotel manager of a new Indian hotel, are not the kind of changes that we expect to see on elders. But have we ever questioned ourselves, why do we have the stigma that elders are always weak and debilitated, why should they stay in their current conditions, and why can't elders take risks and make big these changes to strive for better lives as the young people do? Who said that old age can't be a continuation of ""golden"" years from the past? And if the elders are brave enough to take risks and make changes, why can't we do so? Live fully till the last day of your life.The conversation between Evelyn and Muriel near the end of the movie was particularly impressive to me. When Muriel asks Evelyn whether the latter will stay and help running the Marigold Hotel, Evelyn replied that she was undetermined because ""Nothing here has worked out quite as I expected"". Evelyn may expect this to be a relaxing journey that she could escape from the grief of the death of her husband. She has never expected to be involved in Douglas and Jean's marriage or running business. Muriel said, ""Most things don't. But sometimes what happens instead is the good stuff."" We used to predict as much as possible about what will happen in the future if we take the current step and make a specific choices. We want to have the greatest control about what we will face. We want to prevent failure, suffering and disappointment. We want things to go on as we expected. However, is it really good to us to ponder so much? First, does this really make us feel happier? If you're like a prophet, if you really know everything or most of the things that will happen and make adjustments accordingly to ensure favorable outcomes, will you be motivated to go through this part of life that is totally under your control? Secondly, like what Muriel said, most things simply just will not go as we expected, even you try to exercise your control. We used to think too much, and blame ourselves for the fruitless efforts we made and endure in our own disappointment, but we seldom recognize that: life is unpredictable all the time. You can't program your life. Sometimes we may need to sail along with the wind, do less monitoring but to embrace both sunshine and waves in our lives.It is a relaxing but meaningful movie that allow you to see old-age life at a different angle, reflect your own life and have a glimpse of the cultures and lifestyle in India.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Must say I felt fresh while coming out of the hall. Everyone around were looking cheerful, happy and in good mood. Everyone seemed to know that the movie highlights the serious social issue yet the humorous presentation of the plot and perfect happy ending as in most Bollywood movies touched hearts in the theater, but gently.I would recommend this to everyone from every age.

I was not particularly looking forward to it but within a short period of time I began to wonder if the negative reviewers had actually seen the same film or indeed had seen it at all.I found it a delightful and at times hilarious film and was thoroughly entertained. All the actors delivered well and, of course, Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Celia Imrie were fantastic and the rest of the cast came up to their standard. The cinematography was wonderful and you really saw a very colourful and vibrant India.Take no notice of the critics.

Particularly cringeworthy would be the Judie Dench character lecturing the local telephone helpline workers on how to empathise with rich old middle- class English folks.The script, plotting and storyline are all very lame. It's Love Actually all over again, but less - yes, much less even - believable.Can there be an actor, since dear old Miles Malleson in the old Ealing years, who so regularly got away with producing the same, mannered performance as (how we love him all the same) Bill Nighy, in film after film?A lot of luvvies on a well-paid holiday, but not I think entirely enjoying it. They know what hack-work, in the main part, it is. The audience I was part of absolutely loved it though.

If the story portrayed in the film can be regarded as even remotely possible then sign me up today.It was funny to the point that the whole audience wasn't just laughing but laughing loudly and repeatedly.I didn't care about the actors and actresses playing the roles, just the characters. There is racism, snobbery, love, joy and sadness in just the right amounts throughout the story.The movie is two hours of escapism with just a small undertone of moral fibre thrown in.

If I was asked to name the best actor I would be unable to do so ,I forgot about them being actors and saw them only as the characters they were portraying . The scenery was fantastic and one could almost feel the bustle ,heat and colour of India . Film goers actually chatted to my friend and I on the way out general consensus was that no one character was better than another but i agreed with the lady who said that she would love to take sonny home with her because this character was So lovable.

256,mirichardson,Disappointing,5,22 February 2012,"A fabulous cast who don't disappoint. They play their parts well and you slowly start to feel for them but the direction is so bad that you find most of the characters unbelievable. If the film didn't have Judi Dench and Bill Nighy in it then it would have gone straight to DVD. The cinematography is appalling with most travel shots looking like a home video shot from the back of a motorbike. Jumpy and blurred. With this cast you had every right to expect a memorable film but we have ended up with something that fails to deliver on so many levels. I read many reviews that said nice things about the film but now I have seen it I feel that it is fans of the actors trying to be kind. The cast, the location and the storyline should have made for a surefire winner but I think you will find that there wont be any awards for this film this time next year",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

It's rare to find a movie that moves you to both laughter and tears, and also captures so beautifully the ambiance of an alien culture. And all this while managing to develop credible characterisations in an ensemble cast. From the trailer, I had developed a pre-conceived idea of a kind of Mamma Mia for geriatrics, and superficially it is, but it's so much more. It's a story of hope, redemption and the benefits of keeping your mind open to new experiences.

258,antodob,The funniest film in ages,10,28 February 2012,"What a wonderful movie. I went to see it two nights in a row. Cynics might say that it is everybody's typical view of India. They would be wrong. Yes it is romantic, delightfully so, but it is also very true to India on many levels. Probably the best feature overall was the lighting and camera work which capture the allure of the old palace hotel, while also showing up its seediness. Out of a stunning cast it is difficult to chose a favorite, Maggie \smith shines as she develops from jaundiced old crone to reborn manageress. Judi Dench as always gives an enchanting portrayal of a woman who finds a new life in old age, with Bill Nighy doing his inimitable turn as a stuffed shirt Brit who unbuttons in India. But maybe the best was Penelope Wilton with the hardest job of playing Bill Nighy's wife as an unrepentant snob and control freak.

260,pjt1966,Old Age Actually,8,9 March 2012,"An amazing cast set in a terrific location. The trouble with having such an ensemble cast and seven main characters is that almost inevitably the characters are caricatures. Even India itself was a caricature – its colour and vibrancy played up, its dirt, squalor and poverty played down. Maggie Smith is wonderful as a belligerent old racist forced to go to India to have a hip operation.Judi Dench plays a stoic yet vulnerable recent widow who is unexpectedly left short of cash by her late husband on whom she had depended and trusted for forty years only to be let down by him after his death. Judi Dench can do no wrong as far as I am concerned even in this light role she can say more with a glance than many actors can with an hour of screen time.Tom Wilkinson, the only one of the group wise in the ways of India, plays a retired judge with a secret is reliable if not surprising. Bill Nighy plays Bill Nighy's standard character (can he play anything else?) but this time with a bit more emotional range than normal, he suited the role of a man trapped in a stale marriage who sticks with it out of loyalty. His attitude to India – embracing all it has to offer - differs significantly to his wife's (Penelope Wilton), a real killjoy, and highlights the distance between them in their marriage. Celia Imrie is the hunter of wealthy men who assists Ronald Pickup an inept Lothario (a brilliant turn) these characters are even more thinly sketched than the others. Dev Patel is in danger of getting typecast and he does an adequate job of being a kind hearted by naïve Indian dreamer/hotelier. If I have any negative criticism it is the clichés: untouchables, arranged marriage, Indian call centres, over protective Indian brother, India's homophobia, happy smiling children begging for hand-outs Another reviewer states that no one will win awards for this: well true, but who cares? These actors have got sheds of awards between them and every now and again it's great to go and see a simple, feel good, laugh-out-loud, non-intellectual, non-challenging film. Two hours that passed by with a smile on my face and enough laughs per pound to make it value for money.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

262,nenad-manevski,"""The only real failure is a failure to try""",8,1 April 2012,"I had entered the cinema with low expectation and was really positively surprised. The movie is an excellent drama about the thing we need most - hope and optimism. It is never too late to change our life. A troublesome group of British elders, frustrated and sick, travels to India in order to recuperate in a newly opened resort hotel. Their initial reaction is a shock; hotel is very old, their host is an inexperienced young man, and India's lifestyle is strikingly different from their daily routine. As the time passes, however, the guests are beginning to relax and starting to observe the new world around them - youth, smiles, smells and colors of India. The dramatic change in environment takes them to a personal journey that will profoundly influence their lives. They find friendship, love, and most of all - lost hope that life can be better. The acting, scenography, and camera are simply superb. I have enjoyed the richness in visual expression; India is depicted very lively. The characters are well developed and complex. The humor is subtle and present only as an integral part of the story. Moreover, the movie succeeds to masterfully blend-in several important social issues: homosexuality, racial problems, generation gap. Overall, I enjoyed the movie and recommend it warmly.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

Just wanted to be there with them, it made you want to get on the next plane over to India and join them for tea, or help Sonny fix the place up a bit, it all looked so believable and honest.

Just a good script performed by a fine ensemble cast, with the riot and colour of India as a fascinating backdrop. Bill Nighy played his usual gentle but slightly mischievous self, Judy Dench and Maggie Smith were brilliant as you would expect, and I enjoyed the performance of Slumdog's Dev Patel. Don't be put off by the age of the cast - the story isn't so much about being old as it is about being brave, taking a chance and taking life by the scruff of the neck, whether you're seventeen or seventy.

It deals wonderfully with many inevitable aspects in life. It not only portrays the obvious dealing with old age but also the dreams of youth. The cast is brilliant. From the shining experience of Dame Judy Dench to the brilliant delivery from Dev Patel. This film is presented with passion and brilliance full of scenes and lines brilliantly put together to present a film with as much colour and vibrancy as the place it is set in.

These users were clearly lying to me. The plot was boring and terribly clichéd and I'd heard all of the jokes before. I thought that at least the acting would be of a high standard, but even the 'stars' were dull and wooden. At least you get to see a slice of India - but even that is a thin wedge, as most of the film is spent penned up in the hotel. The characters, too, were all clichéd - racist granny, couple in dried up marriage etc. Sure, the ending was warm fuzzy, but that didn't make it satisfying.To conclude, I want my 124 minutes back.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

There's nothing deep, clever, fresh or new here, just good acting, (mostly) likable, believable characters each coming out of their journey to India with a discovery, a colorful palette (lots of wonderful images of India), and great background music. There's many cliché themes (mother/son issues; getting old issues; marital relationships; chasing old demons), but they all work in this movie. It's great to see a movie that takes place in India that's not a Bollywood carnival nor a treatise on the poverty of India.

We very much enjoyed the work of all the actors, the script, the cinematography and the portrayal of both seniors and Indian culture.If we had one issue with the film it was how everything was just tied up too neatly with a big red bow at the end.

I can't remember another movie with an all ""older"" cast that spoke to me in such a resounding way. These characters are risk takers worthy of inspiring their grandchildren to jump off cliffs rather than settle for spending their old age looking out an apartment window onto someone else's apartment window or making themselves lifetime slaves to health insurance.

I heard Judi Dench say that this will be a big boost to tourism in India, and I think she is right! It was not just a hilarious film. There was pathos too, and I found myself shedding a few tears.

But if you are 60+ it is a moving and rich story about mortality and renewal in a strange land. Sure, the premise is a bit far-fetched. No matter: when you have such outstanding actors as these, who know how to work together without stepping on one another, it works brilliantly.Bill Nighy brings as good a performance as you'll ever see to his role as a diffident former civil servant. His interplay with his new friends as contrasted with his henpecked manner with his wife is truly gifted acting. Similarly, Maggie Smith takes a role that is pretty stereotyped - grumpy misanthrope who is bigoted but sees the light - and turns in a multi-faceted skilled performance that is Oscar-worthy.

Judie Dench was wonderful, her character made me laugh and cry. Everyone in the cast has a different story to tell, they are real people, with a different approach to old age and to the future that lies ahead. Some embrace it and others long for their old lives, while at the same time realising that their old life no longer exists.

279,khaja_ji,An Indian Hotel,10,20 February 2013,"The film Best Exotic Marigold Hotel showed reality. If you follow the characters, the first one, a widow who had trusted her husband with everything and he had left so many debts she had to sell her house. Maggie Smith's character is very true to life. There are people like her who are very prejudiced, and do not trust anyone who is not English. There are people who even fill their suitcases with food, just like she did with biscuits. Then the couple who had invested their money in the daughter's business and thought it was all lost and could only afford to buy a poky little bungalow on a retirement estate. The judge who had enough of his mediocre life and went back to find his friend. The man who only thought of sex. The woman who had delusions of grandeur but no income any more to keep up the lifestyle she wanted.I think that is all of the characters. They were all beguiled by the photos of the Hotel, in all its splendor. A dream of the young man running it. They were all harmless people with no malice in them, except for the wife who found fault with everything her husband did. Except for the one who was going for an operation they were all thinking it would be a good place to retire. To spend ""their autumn years"" as the advert said. Then, there is the mystery of the East. The Indian magic which draws people there. Some hate it but some love it and are instantly at home. It seems to awaken a spirit in the heart. There is a sense of not needing to rush around. To enjoy life. To experience the new sensations. Judi Dench went off looking for a job. The judge found his friend and died happy in the knowledge that his friend's life was not ruined and remembered him with friendship. Maggie Smith was an old spinster who had lived in other people's houses all her life looking after the family and housekeeping. She was a bookkeeper who knew her job well. But she was brusque with everyone. She spoke to the girl who brought her food, giving her instructions how to do her job better, even though the girl did not understand. All she knew is that she was an untouchable who was normally ignored and she was happy for the few words, whatever their tone. Not forgetting the boy running the hotel defying his mother and marrying his girl friend.As the story unfolds, everyone changes a little, they become better people, those who decide to stay. They embrace their new lives and a bit of dust and birds in the room do not matter. It is a new experience. It cannot kill them. They can leave if they are not satisfied. But they stay. Because with all stories like this, it is love which is more important. Taking a chance. In the end, taking a chance can give more rewards than being safe.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
280,junzwood,Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,8,4 August 2013,"When I heard the title for the first time, I was ready for the film to blow my mind and honestly, I'm counting on the word 'exotic'. The background music played as I was ready with my snacks and stuff sitting readily in front of the TV and then Judi Dench, the amazing Dame Judi Dench appeared. I think the reason why people came to see the movie is because of the cast, I mean they're all veteran actors. Great cast plays a huge part in the movie, if a film doesn't have a great cast and plot, people won't bother to see it, doesn't mean you can't have a new comer in a movie. Let's say Jeremy Irvine in 'War Horse', the film did really well but I thought Spielberg also plays the huge part in it too but whatever, we're talking about exotic hotel here.I'm going to be honest, for me, there's some clingy moments in this film, I think it's because them old people? no offense. I think it's safe to say that people came to see the film are late 20s or 30s? cos' this is not the kind of film that most teenagers come to the theatre for, well at least not for me, I watch everything as long as it has great cast and plot in it. Nevertheless, I love the cast's performance, I thought it deserved the SAG nod. They act naturally in the film and I can tell that they're having fun doing it and Maggie Smith is amazing as always, kinda disappointed that she didn't nominated for the Oscar, well blerk. Dev Patel on the other hand, the accent! oh my god, where did he come from? does he even live in India? He lives in UK right? but oh well, he'll always be the slumdog millionaire.I rate this film 7.8/10 or favorable review.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
281,twoyys4me,An Hilarious Movie.,10,1 July 2012,"If you want 2 hours of pure laugh out loud entertainment then this is the movie for you.Yes there are poignant moments but overall this is delivered to your screen by the best of British actors/actresses in their very best deadpan delivery. For me Dame Maggie Smith had the most hilarious lines, followed by the very talented Dev Patel who tied the whole package up as the Manager of the hotel.It's got a great storyline with excellent locations and a good set of characters which all wrap neatly together to make this pure joy.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
282,alanwrmackay,An enjoyable journey for the Baby-Boomers,8,8 November 2014,"With this cast, how can it be anything other than a well written, well acted, enjoyable test of your emotions. It is difficult to single out one particular cast member for special praise as Dench, Wilton,and Nighy all tug at the heart strings whilst Imrie, Pickup and Maggie Smith all incorporate an element of humour in their performances. Tom Wilkinson is excellent as the gay man haunted by the belief that he has ruined the life of an adolescent Indian with whom he had a romantic involvement as a young man. There is sadness, and there are resolutions, but one is left with a warm, comfortable feeling at the end. A feeling that you might join them at the Marigold Hotel in your own twilight years. The only negative is that the constant overdubbing of Indian street sounds (which I appreciate must indeed be constant) as well as typical Indian music, actually makes the dialogue quite difficult to hear.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

284,aumolc,Execellent,10,27 June 2015,"I watched the movie the Best exotic marigold hotel and felt that the plight of old age in any country is very well shown in the context of Indian life in Jaipur and their reaction to it some positive and some in a negative way. India never makes the same impression on anyone in the same way because it is not a run of the mill look alike, feel alike country.There are distinct differences between east and west so often it comes as a great culture shock to see the chaos ,the cows in the street , the plight of untouchables, the run down state of the city,the opulence as well as the stark poverty that draws contrast. On the whole a person can enjoy India if he goes there with a positive mind and not harp on the negatives because India has so much to offer.The movie highlights the way westerners look at India and some come to appreciate its myriad facets that shine in spite of all the squalor. The movie was well done. Dench is a superb actress ( Chocolat fame).",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
285,sherryacarr,Have watched this movie three times and it is still refreshing.,10,31 October 2015,"The cast were all superb. The whole cast did a tremendous job, particularly Penelope Wilton. The story is warmhearted, covering emotional disappointments, joys and hopes. The filming was good, showing a peak into Indian life, with music, color and locations. It is one movie I have recommended to most of my friends, young and old. Because we enjoyed this movie so much, we saw the sequel the day it came out and plan to add it to our DVD collection. If there is an award for movies producing a good feeling this movie would be at the top the list of winners. Thanks to everyone who made this movie. It is a joy to watch.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
286,larsstenberg55,Disappointingly grey,4,8 April 2012,"I was looking forward to this film. However the rich, vibrant settings, great actors and occasional good lines fail to cover up this movie's disappointing lack of substance. Hackneyed characters rarely expand from their initial two dimensions and the cliché-riddled dialogue had me almost singing along in a can-you-guess-the-next-line way, or cringing with embarrassment. A shame. I've no idea whether the book is any better but the idea of a bunch of disillusioned older people hiking off to India to live (and die) together has the potential to be at once brighter, darker, funnier and sadder than this movie even begins to attempt. There is love and there is death here, but they are handled with a light touch that somehow doesn't fit with the gutsy look of the film. Instead we are bombarded with tired visual metaphors such as white birds taking off when one character dies, and homilies: ""it'll be all right in the end, so if it's not all right, it can't be the end"". Then the film ends, which kind of spoils the point. Needed more spice.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel

288,hootietami123,Character driven gem of a movie,8,3 January 2013,"I've seen this movie twice and liked it both times. It took us into a world that was completely foreign to the characters, and foreign to the audience as well. It was eye opening to see a slice of Indian life, if only from a movie perspective. Judi Dench and Maggie Smith were great as always. Each character had their own reasons for being there and had a different outlook on their unfamiliar and shocking surroundings.There was just a little bit about their backgrounds in England, but enough to set the stage for their behavior at the ""Best Exotic Marigold Hotel"". They talk a lot about how they are old, but they seem very youthful for the most part.I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy watching life in a different land that you may not be familiar with, and those who enjoy character driven films.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
289,coletoy,Just Fantastic,9,5 June 2012,"This was just fantastic. I saw it three days ago and I'm still thinking and smiling about it. Superb cast - amazing writing - and the performances were - start to finish - second to none. The swirl of color and chaos (expertly filmed) of the backdrop combined with the tentative efforts of the newly-starting-over-late-in-life (expertly acted) is both effective and intense. I left caring about these characters, and proud of their adjustments (or choices to not adjust) to what can be terrifying at any age - new situations and new environments. From the beginning scenes to the final credits, you watch the elderly (and the young) in states of rebirth - and though you might think that could be boring - I guarantee you'll find yourself terrifically entertained and excited about what comes next.",The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel
