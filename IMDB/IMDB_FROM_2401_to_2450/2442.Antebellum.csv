0,SnoopyStyle,beware of M. Night pitfall,6,22 September 2020,"A slave (Janelle Monáe) suffers in the South during the Civil War. A twist and a shocking revelation later explodes on the screen.The first part takes about 40 minutes. It should be closer to 20 minutes. That way it could be more dreamlike. Then the central part of the movie needs to be different. She can't be as carefree. There needs to be a few more sales girls or a policeman or two. She needs to be constantly oppressed and therefore explaining why she couldn't shut down Antebellum. I really like the shocking revelation but they need to avoid the M. Night Shyamalan trap. The story needs to avoid the worst aspects of his bag of tricks while embracing what he does as a story teller. The most damaging is the location. It can't be where it is for a whole slew of reasons. I get the poetry and the political reason for it but it has difficulties in logic which M. Night sometimes run into. Water! Water, really. Come one M. Night, water. This is Village times a thousand.",Antebellum
1,nogodnomasters,The past is never dead,4,27 September 2020,"For the first 40 minutes we watch slaves on a plantation during the Civil War. Then BAM! It is ""Cloud Atlas"" as we shift to the present time and follow the life of author Veronica (Janelle Monáe) who also talks about the white male dominate system while living in her upscale home. There is also a woman who talks about the past and future in order to give meaning to an otherwise semi-meaningless film.The cell phone thing had me confused as dreams become reality. Google doesn't seem to know of any instance where Confederate soldiers marched chanting ""God and Soil."" My guess it is presentism. The message of the film is as older than Soul on Ice. I think they should made the message more covert to make the film cleverness my concentration.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Antebellum
2,kosmasp,Then and now,10,20 February 2021,"I avoided watching the trailer, so I can't talk about what is given away there, though I can imagine it will be quite a bit. Because going into this I was taken aback by how this begins and even more so, when it transitions. The whole structure actually made me rewatch parts of this - partly to see if I was right with what I was thinking at the time and partly because I expected to have a better insight and maybe see certain things I missed the first time around.And yet still there were even more things I missed. Because the attention to detail here is over the top. What I love is, that everything is carefully planned and placed. There are more than a few clues and so many seeds laid (no pun intended). And there is a rewarding feeling when you catch whatever they serve you.One character is only here to serve as a comedy relief. But I am not putting her or the idea down. On the contrary, that relief is more than welcome and balances out the horror (on multiple levels) and threat that can be felt throughout the movie. And while there is so much subtext here, that even if I wanted to spell it all out, it would certainly exceed the limit that is set on how long a review is, be assured, this movie is much more than just a horror or thriller or whatever you want to call it.But before you are completely taken aback and think this can not be ""enjoyed"" (for the lack of a better word, but you'll understand), you don't even have to pay any attention to all that. And that again is not mean to be taken in any negative form. If you want a good thriller that holds its tension from start to finish, this movie delivers on that premise as well.So while this tackles discrimination (but in an empowering way overall, with all things being cosidered and that includes female voices in the crew and much more) in many forms, it is also a genre movie. That may not sound like much, but walking that thin line is quite the task! The praise I had heard this got before I watched this, is more than deserved!",Antebellum
3,BandSAboutMovies,"Great in idea, not execution",5,9 October 2020,"Antebellum is a movie that would have been much better if I'd never seen the trailer and if the big reveal didn't happen until much later in the movie. As it stands, it's still interesting, but it would have really knocked me out if I had no idea what I was in store for. So that's why I'm giving you the opportunity to look away now, because you deserve to see this with no expectations.Eden (Janelle Monáe) is a slave who has tried to escape before and bears the brand of her owner, Him (Eric Lange). When another girl named Julia (Kiersey Clemons) hangs herself - killing both herself and her unborn child - after the treatment she endures and Eden is again assaulted by Him, she falls asleep.Seriously, spoilers.Eden is really Veronica Henley, a sociologist promoting her new book along with her friends - it's nice to see Gabourey Sidibe in this - when she's targeted by Elizabeth (Jena Malone) and her husband Jasper (Jack Hutton), drugged and taken to the plantation, which exists underknown to the rest of the modern world.Now that she is part of the past - or at least a re-enactment of it - Eden/Veronica must escape or die.Writers, directors and producers Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz have mostly worked in shorts before this, but the film has some moment of real slow motion beauty that was filmed using the actual lenses from Gone with the Wind.Basically, consider this a woke The Village, except that movie had the sense to wait until - again - the close before the twist. That said, I wasn't bored by this, but the times we meet Veronica, she seems much less likable than Eden.Regardless, any time that women of color can be the lead in any movie - much less a horror film - is a reason to celebrate. Check it out for yourself - it's yet another movie where a woman done wrong sets a house on fire and walks away in slow motion - and let me know what you think.",Antebellum
4,view_and_review,Trailers Were Misleading,4,28 December 2020,"I'd like to sue for false advertisement. The trailers for this movie truly misled me. I was under the impression this was going to be a horror movie with supernatural occurrences. In the trailer the scenes jumped from present day to antebellum era, then there was a scene of a plane suddenly appearing in the sky above a slave plantation as if they were in a parallel universe where slavery lasted past the industrial age. There was a flash scene of a woman bending over backwards like she was an evil spirit. The whole of it painted a very eerie picture with otherworldly undertones.The movie wasn't nearly as mystical or creepy. Basically, a group of butt-hurt southerners created a fake plantation in the middle of nowhere where they'd kidnapped Black people and forced them to live as slaves. This premise has so many flaws, but we'll overlook those for now.The movie begins on this plantation with no indication that it's anything other than an antebellum plantation in the South. After awhile you get the sense that something is not quite right. The manner in which the ""slaves"" are speaking is very anachronistic. Their diction is too good and even some of their vocabulary doesn't belong. One ""slave"" even uses the term ""cracker,"" which completely didn't belong. That same Black man stared down the overseer when he spoke to him, which would never happen during slavery times unless the slave had a death wish.I simply thought that the writer of the script was clueless about slavery which just upset me. I didn't recognize those anachronisms as intentional clues because they were subtle and they weren't highlighted like important clues normally are. When the main character, Veronica (Janelle Monae), woke up in a modern-day bed and home it only further confused me. It wasn't shown as a flashback, it was shown as though Veronica just woke up from a bad dream in which she was a slave.The movie continued on with some exposition where we got to know what Veronica was all about. The exposition carried on too long to the point I thought we were completely done with the slavery scenes and we were just going to watch Veronica be with her friends. The present day scenes were so boring and irrelevant I was ready to quit the movie. Precious movie time was being eaten up and I had yet to see anything remotely scary or even eerie.The movie wraps up with Veronica back on the plantation making her getaway. That's when we find out the ""big reveal,"" the plantation is a modern day replica in the backwoods of Louisiana. Veronica had to fight her way to freedom which included burning two men alive. It was supposed to be a liberating scene, but all I could think of was, ""Don't waste your time burning them, just get out of there.""On her way out of the nightmare she was in she passed by a statue of Robert E. Lee. The statue standing there so regal and reverential at the edge of the fake plantation was clear in its meaning. It was to illustrate that monuments of confederates are only memorializing the atrocities of the South. I understood the point of this movie, but boy did they take a long yawn inducing route to it.",Antebellum
5,ferguson-6,a twisty contrast,5,14 November 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. This is the movie for anyone unaware that racism was prevalent during the Civil War, and still continues to this day. Of course anyone fitting that description is likely enjoying their life in a cave, and is clueless that movies exist. It even goes as far to ""inform"" us that slaves were abused, tortured, and lynched, while today racism can take the more subtle form of a less desirable restaurant table or a concierge with an attitude. However, while the message may be unnecessary and too obvious, the originality and creative approach of filmmakers Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz is commendable, especially for their first feature film.An uninterrupted extended take kicks off the movie, and shows us the lay of the land at a cotton plantation where the slaves are controlled by confederate soldiers. When an attempted escape goes wrong, the brutality of the soldiers is on display. One of the slaves is Eden, played by Janelle Monae. She's the favorite of the General (Eric Lange, seen recently in two popular cable mini-series, ""Escape at Dannemora"" and ""Perry Mason""), and he literally brands her as his property. Many of the sequences are difficult to watch as the cruelty and abuse is not sugar-coated.When we next see Ms. Monae wake up from a dream, she's living in a swanky home with a perfect husband (Marque Richardson) and cute daughter. She's now Veronica, a well-known author and speaker who is living the American dream. A night on the town with her friends played by Gabourey Sidibe (Oscar nominated for PRECIOUS, 2009) and Lily Cowles purposefully comes across like it's from a different movie altogether. It's this contrast the filmmakers use to deliver their M Night Shyamalan style twist. Afterwards, it's wheels-off for the movie, but we are able to assemble the pieces of what we've seen to this point.Jena Malone and Jack Huston also play key roles here, but it's Ms. Monae who gets the majority of the screen time, and mostly nails both Eden and Veronica. Although much of the film and story seems exaggerated and over-played, cinematographer Pedro Luque (THE GIRL IN THE SPIDER'S WEB, 2018) delivers a beautifully shot film, so it always looks good, regardless of what else we might be thinking. Filmmakers Bush and Renz likely have much more nuanced and effective storytelling in their future, and we do expect Ms. Monae to take the step from supporting roles to leads. She's earned it.",Antebellum
6,deloudelouvain,Why would you give this a negative score is a total mystery to me.,9,20 September 2020,"I'm glad I didn't read anything about this movie before watching it, and certainly not all those extremely negative reviews on here. I wouldn't read anything if I were you so you'll be as surprised as I was when the twists and turns unfolds. Because even if I was surprised and mostly sceptic in the beginning of the first turn I have to admit that was some clever writing from Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. I didn't see it coming at all and that's what makes it even better. I don't know why people have to compare it to the things that happen in real life now, it's pointless, it's a movie, nothing else, but a pretty good one. The acting was very good from the whole cast, the directing and cinematography on top, and the story surprising, engaging, and mysterious. One of the better movies I've seen in a long time and I watch two to three movies every day. You could compare it to Get Out for the theme, but it's a totally different story, so I wouldn't.",Antebellum
7,JamesHitchcock,The past is not dead. It's not even past.,4,21 April 2021,"""Antebellum"" is a film in three acts. Act I is set (or so we are led to believe) on a Louisiana slave plantation during the American Civil War. The plantation has recently been taken over by the Confederate Army, and the slaves are treated harshly. They are routinely beaten, female slaves are raped and any who attempt to escape are killed.Act II is set in the present day. The main character is a well-known black sociologist named Veronica Henley. She goes on a tour to publicise her latest book, and while she is in Louisiana she is attacked and kidnapped by a white couple after getting into the wrong taxi.Veronica is played by the same actress, Janelle Monáe, who also plays Eden, one of the slaves on the plantation in Act I, but the significance of this does not become clear until later. At first, in fact, we are misled into believing that the events depicted in Act I are all a dream taking place in Veronica's mind. Act III again takes place on the plantation, but now the Confederate soldiers have mobile phones, as we Brits would call cell phones. (And, no, this isn't a piece of alternate history showing how the South won the Civil War by making use of a new form of communications technology invented by a brilliant Southern scientist more than a century ahead of his time). It turns out that the plantation exists in the year 2020, not the Civil War era, disguised as a theme park, and that black people are being kidnapped and forced to work there as slaves. Veronica, it would seem, has been singled out because the white people do not like the idea of an affluent and successful black woman, especially one who has written a book critical of American racism.Yes, I know that's a spoiler, but then this is the sort of film it is virtually impossible to discuss without spoilers. Its central twist recalls that of M Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"", which also appeared at first to be set in the nineteenth century, but was later revealed to be taking place in the twenty-first. (There is, however, a difference in that the inhabitants of Shyamalan's village, or at least the younger ones, did indeed believe themselves to be living in the year 1897).""The Village"" is a difficult film to fit neatly into any one genre, but perhaps the best description would be as a mysterious, haunting parable about modern life and the dangers of nostalgia. ""Antebellum"" likewise doesn't fit neatly into either the thriller or the horror genre, and was obviously intended as a parable about racism. The scenario we are presented with in ""The Village"" is inherently implausible, but Shyamalan handles his material skilfully enough to persuade us that it might just be possible. Directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz are never able to persuade us that the central premise of ""Antebellum""- that in the year 2020 it is still possible for white supremacists to kidnap, torture, rape and murder black Americans, not in some remote hideaway but in full view in a theme park, without the police or anyone else intervening, or even noticing- is anything other than inherently absurd.The best feature of the scene is the depiction of plantation life in Act I, but it must be said that the cruelties of slavery were much better depicted in Steve McQueen's ""Twelve Years a Slave"" and Nate Parker's ""Birth of a Nation"", two films which were content to tell their harrowing stories in a straightforward manner without resorting to twists, gimmickry or dubious parables. 2020 has also seen a much better anti-racist film, ""The 24th"", which tells of how racist attitudes rooted in memories of slavery persisted into the Jim Crow era of the early twentieth century.""Antebellum"" starts with a quote from William Faulkner, ""The past is not dead. It's not even past,"" but it interprets Faulkner's words in a very literalistic manner. He meant that the present is informed and shaped by the past, not that the present is just the same as the past so we shouldn't be surprised to see a slave plantation in twenty-first century Louisiana. The way in which race relations in America have been informed and shaped by past events, a theme which Faulkner often treated in his novels, would also make a theme for a great movie. Unfortunately, this is not it. 4/10.",Antebellum
8,thesar-2,Another Village to Avoid,3,1 December 2020,"Dreams can come true! I guess.I thought I heard Antebellum was a fantastic and original movie and I was one-quarter right. It's somewhat original, but the story lacked 100% and I'm left with the feeling: this was a first draft from one drunk buddy to another.It's beautifully shot and acted and the costumes/settings were great, sure, but what the hell. Was this supernatural, real or both? I think it wanted to be one of them and never quite told us. I've seen plenty of movies that left the ending open for interpretation, but after the 1st third twist is revealed - and believe me, I did NOT see that coming, it never fit in with the rest of the narrative, despite any ""opinions.""Trying to avoid any spoilers, this is mostly about Civil War slaves and the nasty Confederate soldiers controlling them. But, it's also about other people's lives, that we barely get to know with the exception of the always wonderful Gabourey Sidibe who may of thought she was in a different movie. We definitely get to know her character.This is almost two hours - PLENTY of time to connect the dots and they failed. I don't need a playbook or exposition or even narration to make it easy, but I do need a coherent idea that binds the ending to the first two-thirds.And this is sad. This looked great and the opening act to that first twist made me heavily invested. They say this was from the producers of Us and I got that wonderful vibe.Too bad Antebellum wanted none of Us.***Final thoughts: Not to influence my review, rating or thoughts, I have read/watched no other reviews of this or watched the ""Ending Explained"" YouTube vids I love. Yet. I'm about to because I can't be alone here.(Okay, I did sneak a peek at Rotten Tomatoes just this minute at the end of my take, but not for the individual reviews. The 28% it got did, however, tell me I am NOT alone here.)",Antebellum
9,FeastMode,DON'T WATCH THE TRAILERS,7,21 July 2021,"It never ceases to baffle me how often trailers spoil a movie. For antebellum, i went in blind, and it took me on a ride i won't forget. I watched the trailer after. It spoiled the entire movie. I can't believe it. And on top of that, it was completely misleading. I'm so glad i don't watch trailers any more. It would have robbed me of a great experience.This movie is well-directed with great cinematography and some beautiful shots. It hooked me immediately and never let go. I was invested in the story and the characters. It had me at the edge of my seat numerous times. I had a great time overall (1 viewing, 7/18/2021)SPOILERSi didn't know what the movie was about when i turned it on. I only saw the poster and that horror was listed as a genre. I legitimately thought it was a straight up horror flick like something with ghosts or demons.It started out in the civil war era. I had no reason to believe it would ever move from that era. I was definitely into it, but at one point i started thinking, ""i like movies that are different or unique, and this premise doesn't seem like it can go anywhere out of the ordinary""right then, we switch to present day... WHAAAAAAAAA. Interesting. We follow the same actress playing a different character. So now i assume it's like different versions of the same person at different points in time. Color me intrigued.Only problem is, where can it really go from here. Can the stories conclude in a satisfying way? Or are we going to get random unrelated parallel stories a la cloud atlas, a movie i HATED.Right then we switch back to ""olden times,"" but we still hear the cell phone ring, and the general answers it.......WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW. The past is the present and the present is the past. The ENTIRE context of everything we watched has been changed. It went from ""it's so sad that black ppl had to suffer through slavery"" to ""omg, they're kidnapping present day black ppl and turning them into slaves.""and most importantly, there is a fully satisfying conclusion that ties in both stories. Bravo. I love that this is basically a super hardcore civil war reenactment. Also, why are civil war reenactments allowed? Even if you ignore the racism aspect of it (which you can't), you're still celebrating the deaths of hundreds of thousands of americans by their own hands. Smh.",Antebellum
10,Cineanalyst,Bellum,3,6 February 2021,"Er, ""antebellum"" is Latin for ""before war."" The movie should be called ""bellum."" ""Postbellum"" would also be more accurate. An antebellum civil war reenactment is oxymoronic, and there are Confederate soldiers and a flag on the plantation, so the movie is clearly addressing the period of America's Civil War. I'm not sure if there was any other reasoning beyond illiteracy for the title--thinking it a cool word that's been associated with slavery. But, ""antebellum"" has long been used to refer to the pre-war American South, which, yes, slavery existed antebellum, but it also did bellum--it was the reason for it, so....I suppose it's appropriate, however, that ""Antebellum"" was advertised as from the producer--yeah, big whoop, the producer--of ""Get Out"" (2017) and ""Us"" (2019), because it's quite derivative of those Jordan Peele pictures, minus craft and intelligence, with merely the indication of a message on race to go along with its poorly-paced horror of a movie. I mean, honestly, did the writers even know what they were trying to make the protagonist say in her public talks or did they merely insert random platitudes and generalizations? Her book does not sound interesting--it doesn't sound like anything. Anyways, if you see the advertisement on a poster or trailer and ""producer"" is written small enough and ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" large enough, you can fool people into being excited about a movie from rookie directors and having nothing to do with Peele. At least, that's how I saw it. Although, to be fair, it does star Janelle Monáe, and she's OK in it.Rather than cinematically-reflexive horror film, this is exploitation. More ""Mandingo"" (1975) than ""12 Years a Slave"" (2013), but even ""Mandingo"" was better at being risqué and challenging in its outrageousness. ""Antebellum"" is just intermittently gross and easily could've cut some 20 minutes from the runtime to make it less dull otherwise and even without getting rid of the stupid slow-mo shots. It finally picks up at the end with some action scenes, but at that point it's more a relief that the movie is almost over.",Antebellum
11,westsideschl,Interestingly Newsworthy,8,8 December 2020,"In the past couple of decades I've seen maybe two movies with similar plot structures, but different storylines. In a unique way we see a strong statement about racism in America (although to be fair, it exists in every country with their own marginalized racial/ethnic group (s)).
Cannot really say much about the movie w/out giving it away. On the positive side the acting was good; the story moved along well & offered another perspective on the issue. On the negative side escaping should have been easier especially w/intelligent decisions that could have been made. Seemed overbalanced w/nothing but cruelty.

13,UniqueParticle,Much better than expected/perceives to be!,9,1 November 2020,"Sure the trailer is misleading it's more of a drama/thriller with a few horror elements so if you want a full on horror this isn't it. Jonelle Monáe is magnificent throughout really gives an extraordinary performance! The bulk of the movie is about trying to escape a slavery colony with some mysterious aspects mixed in there.The cinematography is absolutely incredible, would've been nice to see in the theater but at home on Halloween with a 4K TV was good enough and watched with my sister Emily along with our dog Lucas that was all delightful!

14,cruise01,Premise that could have been so much more falls flat in the middle and lacking the thrills.,5,3 November 2020,"2.5 out of 5 stars.Antebellum is a horror thriller film that could have been so much more with its premise. Without giving away spoilers and the territory it crosses with the story. Which had a great twist that reveals itself in the second act. But falls flat with a direction that leaves this premise very empty with thrills and scares. Not sure if it would be in a horror category. More of a weak thriller.The plot is about Veronica (Janelle Monae) a successful writer/spokeperson with a loving family. Until she wakes up in the past. Captured and trying to survive living in a plantation. That is led by Jasper (Jack Huston). Enough said about the plot without crossing spoilers. The twist does not disappoint. Sadly, the direction does not do anything more with the premise besides leaving the script to being very hallow with its potential.The film starts out like a bleak drama as Veronica is in the plantation. Seeing other slaves being beaten. Assaulted and executed. While she familiarize herself in walking in her room without making any wooden floor noises which comes back to why she is doing that later. But when the film flashes back to the present time, learning more about her character. The drama and direction gets very flat with boring characterization and dialogue. The film tries to build some suspense but it fails to thrill. The second act is were it falls flat and is weak with its direction til it picks back up in the third act and climax after the twist is revealed.Janelle Monae delivered a great performance as Veronica. Jack Huston played a great villain. Jena Malone also delivered an eerie performance. Gabourey Sidibe stood out as an annoying character that delivered horrible dialogue.The film does get a little violent in the third act but it fails to thrill or even be scary with its concept. And some uneven direction that does not know what it is trying to be.",Antebellum
15,eddie_baggins,A squandered opportunity,2,1 October 2020,"If you'd seen any of the trailers or marketing for Antebellum in the previous few months you'd be excused for thinking this was a genuine horror film with mind-bending plot twists but the film we have now as a finished product is sure to leave many confused and disappointed despite there being a great concept deep down somewhere in this messy offering.A visually splendid film that starts off in great fashion only to turn into a forty plus minute experience in slavery torture drama 101, that then transforms into a modern day stretch that will test the patience of even the most patient and undemanding of viewers, Antebellum squanders its chance to deliver something profound and unexpected as it heads on its way to The Village like territory of genre filmmaking where we spend far too long on a journey to a pay-off that will cause further frustrations rather than celebrations.Music video directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz try their best to enliven proceedings with some great visual flourishes and some moody set-pieces but their interesting work behind the camera is unable to make amends for the films lack of good characters or development, shoddy pacing and a tension free feeling despite the films thriller and horror elements rearing their heads occasionally throughout the films arduous runtime.Front and centre for most of the film is rising star Janelle Monae who gets duel roles as modern day author Veronica and slavery era Eden, in what acts as a disappointing chance for the talented performer to showcase her skills on the big stage.Originally intended for a semi high profile cinematic run that was scuttled at the last minute in favour of a safer bet via a VOD release in many key markets, Antebellum could've been Monae's big break after noted turns in the likes of Hidden Figures, Moonlight and Harriet but she has little to work with here with both Veronica and Eden rather cold figures, both of whom are unable to capture us in any significant way.As we viewers trudge through the hard to bare film's opening and middle sections, there's a faint hope that where we are being taken too is going to make it all worth it but with Gabourey Sidibe's detestable supporting turn as one of Veronica's closest friends fresh in our mind and a realization that most of the films screen time is nothing but wasted reels of film, Antebellum's lackluster ending sums up a film that was unable to create any magic around its intriguing central idea.Final Say -Neither a horror or a thriller that can provide any actual thrills, Antebellum wants to be a genre film with a message but all it ends up achieving is a resounding sense of a missed opportunities.1 mobile phone out of 5",Antebellum
16,Tweetienator,Failed to Entertain Me,3,17 October 2020,"Antebellum will get lots of praise or get slammed - simple because of the ""political"" implications the story got regarding racism, but for my taste Antebellum is for a connoisseur of true horror a rather boring affair. I like for example 12 Years a Slave a lot, but the horror genre is in my view not the right place for that kind of ""serious"" story or message - too many times I cheer for the bad guys in such movies (like in Get Out I voted for the crazies and not for our meant to be hero).

18,southdavid,Mo Monae Mo Problems,5,4 April 2021,"I remember the trailers for ""Antebellum"" in the cinema's before covid closed them down again. Now the film's arrived on Sky Movies and having now seen the film, I feel like it's an interesting premise, but struggles with the story it's telling inside it.'Eden' (Janelle Monae) is a slave suffering cruel punishments and abuse at the hands of Confederate soldiers on a cotton plantation. Having tried to escape previously, she's branded by the General (Eric Lange) who keeps her at his shack. Veronica (Janelle Monae) is a successful writer on the subject of race and gender dynamics in modern day America. Though seemingly very different people, the links between these two women are very strong, and horrors of the Civil War era are not as lost to the past as they seem.I am going to try and write the rest of this without giving away the twist, for ""Antebellum"" is a 'twist movie' - so much so I felt it had more in common with the movies of M Knight Shyamalan than it does with those of Jordan Peele. What I mean by that is that I feel like the twist is all there is, like the development of the story didn't really go much beyond coming up with it. So, the ending of the film is pretty underwhelming and a couple of layered in ideas from earlier in the film don't come to anything.The central performances from Janelle Monae are really good. The performances beyond that aren't particularly memorable, with perhaps only Gabourey Sidibe making much on an impression as Veronica's best friend. Jack Huston's evil Captain Jasper probably has the second most amount of lines, but the character is a familiar one. There's some really nicely shot scenes of horrible things with first time feature writer/directors Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz showing a good eye for cinematography.Though it's grim viewing at times, it's not really interested in being a horror film beyond the thought that this was real life only 150 years ago or so. Once the film has revealed it's secret it isn't sure what to do with itself and the resolutions that it does provide are half baked.",Antebellum

Ever since I first heard about it I have been aching to see it. It just looked like such a well put together film and such a mysterious and interesting plot. Finally tonight I got to see it and I can confirm all of those things were true and much more as well. This film was gripping from start to finish.I absolutely love the structure this film was told with. It threw me and had me a little baffled for a while there, but in the end it all made sense and was easy to go back and see things from a different light where the film had deceived me (in a good way). Twists in films are becoming rarer and rarer, but I still love a good one when it comes around and this was a banger.The film is broken up into three very distinct thirds, and I loved every one of them in its own way. Each of them them has a lot to offer, and the film wouldn't be what it was without each of them adding their piece. The final one though will blow you away. This is such a unique film. It's really hard to think of anything that would be a decent comparison for it. Originality in this day and age is such a rare and under-appreciated thing.Finally, this movie was tense. The final twenty minutes in particular. I cared so much about the characters and their fate that I was on the edge of my seat throughout. I would suggest the less you know about this film going in, the more you are going to enjoy it. This is a wonderful film and an absolute must-see.",Antebellum
21,kevin_robbins,I'd skip this and call it one of the lesser films of 2020.,2,15 May 2021,"I grabbed Antebellum (2020) off Verizon Fios for $19.99 last weekend with the Mrs (I know, shame on me). The storyline focuses on a woman in slavery who appears to have rescinded from her escape attempts after seeing those that she loves killed in their and her escape attempts. In a parallel storyline, in present day, we view the same woman as an independent successful woman who sees and experiences oppression in different ways. Somehow the past of the slave woman and the current life present day woman's are tied together. This movie is directed by Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz in both of their directorial debuts and stars Janelle Monae (Moonlight), Tongayi Chirisa (iZombie), Gabourey Sidibe (Precious), Jack Huston (American Hustle) and Robert Aramayo (Game of Thrones). I'm going to start with this movie is terrible. It tried to take some clever concepts similar to The Village and Us and tie in slavery and social injustices for something clever and it didn't work. The movie is choppy, doesn't blend together well and is poorly executed. This was a huge disappointment and could have been so much better but the writing fell short. Overall, I'd skip this and call it one of the lesser films of 2020. I'd score it a 2/10.",Antebellum
22,JoBloTheMovieCritic,Antebellum,6,11 December 2020,6/10 - Janelle Monáe's first starring role is a good story with bits of failed execution,Antebellum
23,alindsay-al,A Below Average Messy Film,4,3 April 2021,"After a disruptive release schedule Antebellum has finally made its way to the UK on Sky and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a woman trapped in a terrifying scenario and how she adapts to life within it.Main Character
Janelle Monae plays the lead in this film and I thought she was decent here. Her character goes through a lot in this film and you do really sympathise for her and Monae does a good job of telling that particular story. But the issue is that there isn't a huge amount of depth to her character and we don't learn enough, I don't want to go into depth because this film is guarded in secrecy but I think the fact there isn't enough meat to the role is what holds it back.Supporting Characters
There are a few supporting characters but in my opinion only one of them was that memorable and that was Kiersey Clemons. She isn't in the film a huge amount but she is the highlight of every scene she is in and you really grow to care about her and I felt like maybe the film would have been more effective if she had been the main character of the film. But the rest of the cast are paper thin, the bad guys are cliché and offer nothing unique and new to their roles and the friends of Monae's character are just annoying and really took away from the film.Story
The story is interesting, there is no doubt it keeps you guessing throughout and I can't deny that I was intrigued as the story went on and then the twist came and I thought it was a good idea and something I didn't see coming. But then it all comes down to execution and that is sorely lacking here, the plot deviates too much in its second act and takes too long to get going to the point where the story gets interesting. Then the last act is a bit all over the place with plot holes and stupidity coming from plenty of different places.Script
Easily the worst part of the film for me. The script has no bite to it, this film has serious subject matters but the script doesn't convey them well enough and you will have seen plenty of films that have done it way better and made you feel plenty of emotions. Also don't get me started on the humour, it is awful and made one particular character the most annoying character you will see in any film that there is.Style
This film looks great, the film is shot beautifully with cinematography that rises this pretty small scale film above the really bad level. However, the film is just too slow for me and takes too long to get to its point which takes interesting ideas and stretches them out for way too long.Overall
Overall, Antebellum is a below average film. It has a few nice ideas but doesn't execute them well enough to be at the level it wants to be. I would say unless you are a huge fan of thriller/horror then give this a skip as it isn't very good.",Antebellum
24,joiningjt,"Brilliant film, it's not a horror per say but a fantastic film!!",9,28 November 2020,Even a year a go I wouldn't have bought this premise but after trump as president and what I've witnessed these last few years I know my thought of what America is was a fraud. Not going to delve into why but let's just say racism is alive and prospering in America. Now the film I remember the trailer and I to thought it was entirely a different movie than what I saw but if I grade it on its merits it's a solid 9 almost a 10. I figured out the twist but didnt matter it's a phenomenal film and a shame people dont see that. Extremely Underrated and entertaining I will watch what these directors/writers do in the future. P.S. its WAY better than the village!! And although it does have some horrible things happen I'd classify it as a thriller/ drama.,Antebellum
25,Pairic,Dark Tale Of Slavery,7,11 November 2020,"Antebellum: Nothing supernatural about this just the horrors of slavery. This terror is inflicted by white supremacists led by a U.S. Senator. They dress in Confederate uniforms as they lord it over abducted African-Americans, who are treated as slaves, made to pick cotton, serve as cooks and sex-slaves. Among these prisoners is sociologist/activist Veronica Henley (Janelle Monae) who has in the past clashed with Senator Denton (Eric Lange). Denton clothes himself as a Confederate General and takes Henley as his personal slave, branding her when she tries to escape and refuses to say her save name. Other escapees are executed, whipped, tortured. Truly a dark nightmare, extremely violent and disturbing in places, some of this when the ""slaves"" fight back. Not a film you will forget in a hurry. Co-Written and Co-Directed by Gerard Bush and Christopher Reinz. 7/10.",Antebellum
26,andrewchristianjr,TWIST WTF.,6,19 September 2020,"Another disappointment of the year. Not as eventful and thrilling as I had hoped for it to be. Unnecessary plot twist. It had so much potential to be its own unique horror story, but in the end, it flaunted itself to be bland.",Antebellum
27,I_Ailurophile,"Grim, but great, defying all expectations",9,15 May 2021,"The terror of racist violence, the horror of slavery, and a modern fascist vision mirroring the story of historical figures, all mixed together and wrapped up in a bleak, violent thriller. This is 'Antebellum.'Themes and concepts that Veronica discusses in her ordinary life are reflected and realized with stark clarity in the nightmare concocted by the antagonists. A couple minor moments briefly noted in passing in the story - an intermediary scene, a few lines of dialogue - are pointedly and neatly echoed in the hell later endured. The narrative's reiteration of these devices, like its sudden leap between points in time, is sharp and jarring, to the point that they all collectively ride a line between a) being steadfastly appropriate as storytelling elements and b) threatening our suspension of disbelief.Yet this is the only criticism that immediately comes to mind after watching 'Antebellum.' And I sat down for this movie fully expecting to dislike it.The first thing to note is that Janelle Monae is absolutely outstanding. She wowed us with a dramatic supporting role in 'Hidden figures,' and 'Antebellum' shows another side to her as a heroine in a rather different type of story. The sense of horror she projects in the plantation scenes, accompanied by steel resolve, contrasts heavily with the warm confidence she bears in depicting Veronica's ordinary life - yet she embodies it all so capably. Moreover, I have no doubt that the wardrobe selected for Veronica is based on Monae's personal sense of flair, and she doesn't just wear those outfits, she dominates them.The rest of the cast is highly laudable in their performances, as well, but special note must be made especially for Jena Malone. Her turn as wicked Elizabeth is quite unlike any other roles she's taken on, least of all her portrayal of sweet Mary in 'Saved!' that marked her first starring role. Malone harbors Elizabeth's malevolence and duplicity like it was second nature, and clearly revels in the heightened emotions at the climax. Kudos as well to Gabourey Sidibe, co-starring in a supporting part as Veronica's friend Dawn. Sidibe has limited time on screen, yet she too bears such great, jubilant confidence and poise that she lights up the screen. For those few minutes that we see her character, Sidibe is a joy, and offers welcome respite from the darkness that pervades the rest of the feature.And truly, 'Antebellum' is no walk through the park. Every layered aspect of the narrative thrust is grim and frightening, but the screenplay of Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz takes themes still further by giving the antagonists lines that pull slogans directly from recent real life events, headlines, and hate groups. This is a film that requires definite content warnings, as it may cut too close to home for some viewers with a history of especially traumatic experiences.At the same time - in addition to the excellent cast, 'Antebellum' is just so very well made. Wardrobe, makeup, hair, sets, props - whether scenes take place in the modern city or on the Confederate-run plantation, everything looks vivid and believable, and altogether fantastic. Some shots, especially toward the end of the film, are genuinely beautiful to behold; to that end, much deserved credit to director of photography Quyen Tran for her great skill.For all the hardship on display, the loathsome parallels to real life, and the violence, 'Antebellum' is also deeply thrilling, with every slight twist making us wonder just how it's all going to play out. That's particularly true at the climax, when Veronica seizes her opportunity and strikes out against her captors in some gleefully cheer-worthy acts of vengeance.The thing is, I never expected to like 'Antebellum' in the first place. I've yet to see a synopsis, however minimal or expansive, that accurately conveys the direction of the story, or the actual sequence of events. When it was first released, I figured I'd never get around to watching it, so in my curiosity I read the entire plot from start to finish. And the synopsis I read, calling to mind those lifelike parallels I've noted, further suggested such extreme sexual violence that I found it hard to believe I, or anyone, could enjoy this.Yet here I am - I had a chance to watch 'Antebellum,' so I did. What I had read of it was broadly correct, but left out some details, and got others wrong. The violence, though awful, isn't as graphic as I had feared, and despite the detestable subject matter, it's such a quality, exciting movie that my foreknowledge didn't even affect my enjoyment.I have most assuredly been surprised. My expectations were upended; I expected to hate 'Antebellum,' but instead I Iove it. For many reasons, this movie is not going to be for everyone. But it's an intensely arresting thriller that came and went with too little fanfare, and deserves much more attention than I think it's gotten.Very well done, and highly recommended!",Antebellum
28,aidanratesmovies,"Weird Movie, not much more",5,27 December 2020,"A misleading trailer and a stupid twist aside, Antebellum can be a decently entertaining movie (although it is certainly hard to watch at times), and although it is uneven it has a few good moments to spare. I wasn't a huge fan of this movie, I expected a lot more if I am being honest, and instead what we got is a confusing and often muttled mess. Janelle Monae really makes this film work at times, and there is no doubt she is the best part of the film entirely. Her talent is unmatched though, as every other character and actor seems to be an annoying stereotype or too over the top to handle. The premise of the film is intriguing, and it was bound to have massive potential, but there is just such a lack of execution throughout this film from making it anything but good. It's a mediocre film, focusing on modern issues with a historic twist of sorts, similar to M. Night's The Village. The cinematography is excellent, but the direction is drab and emotionless, and it just feels like this film could have been made better with some capable talent behind the scenes. Not music video directors. In the end, Antebellum wasn't as awful as people said it was, but it wasn't really good either.
My Rating: 5.5/10",Antebellum
29,questl-18592,Ante-Climactic,3,4 January 2021,"Brought to you by the people behind Get Out and Us! Starting the stunning and talented Janelle Monae!There was so much promise in the advertising for this. When it actually starts I find myself really appreciating the opening cinematography as we are treated to a wonderful long shot to draw us in. Buuuuuuut then it's all downhill from there.Antebellum falls squarely into that ""movie thinks it's smarter than it is"" territory and never manages to pull out. It's preachy, it doesn't track logically and it never manages to generate any emotional resonance. It also feels played out. Not to spoil but as soon as the ""twist"" became obvious this felt very similar to another film.Oh, and the characters all feel like they're devoid of depth and personality. I.E. there's one woman that's a relationship guru or something and they're all out and a guy sends her a drink. Now, a normal person might be flattered, happy, nervous, weirded out or whatever but this character instead goes on a diatribe about how he sent her the wrong kind of drink. It felt so clunky, so forced and uncomfortable and looking back I realize that's basically the crux of this movie.I feel like there has to be some director's cut out there. Some master edition of this thing that's maybe half an hour longer and actually tires some of this stuff together better. It needs it, it really does. As it stands, it feels like the creators has very clear motives and agendas in mind, honorable though they may be, and only focused on getting those out rather than creating a fully formed concept or properly developed characters.Monae, you deserve better than this. As wonderful as she is though, this isn't worth watching. Unfinished story, sloppy editing and effects, clunky characters ruin any good will the concept may have had. If you must, stream it. Don't waste money on this.",Antebellum

The Focus On The Political Aspect Than The Story
Not Really ScarySummary:A strong thriller like this where political idealism seems to be key is going to require a strong acting cast to lift the crew. Well... Monae accomplishes this and does so much of the lifting that the rest of the cast is almost absent. Without revealing any details, Monae's character spans this odd tail and requires her to play across the range of character traits from the oppressed slave trying to keep things together despite being tortured, to the strong headfast modern woman that is the hot trend. She does each role with poise, professionalism, and fervor that I was able to murk through the swamp of this movie by just focusing on her talent alone. The other characters do their part, for the little time they have, but they work to add some comedy, love, and attachment, though oddly placed, that our character needs.
Moving on the setting of the movie is interesting at times serving the theme of the movie and sometimes providing the necessary visual chemistry to get your spine tingling, Primarily the hallways of the hotel and the dark bliss of the night, Antebellum's setting adds some realistic fervor that is the true haunting part, but serves more so for the other them of this message as a political thriller. The music further helps add its own emotional fervor to the film be it creepy ambience to hint at something happening, aggressive tracks to represent the mood of the film, to even the inspiring orchestral piece designed to inspire and send you into battle. The audio and visual are certainly the gimmicks that will help set the mood and help try to drown out the limitations of the film, which with Monae as the center star are pretty much the main positives for this reviewer. In terms of originality, it at least took a different manor of presenting a limited used concept, which artistic goers will love to watch unfold, while casual goers may find a bit convoluted and forced.However, this reviewer found more dislikes than likes for this film given the direction the trailers led me to believe would be the source. It starts with the pacing and the fact that the film is super slow and dragged out for a horror movie. Timing the film as I did, I found that the aspects I was looking for did not hit until around 45-50 minutes, with the first part being an elaborate set up for the potential twist. It's not so thrilling, and with my expectations, I believe that was the part that dragged the movie out. Despite the slow pace, the movie's plot unfortunately was not layered, developed, or entertaining for me and when looking at the frame of the movie was disappointing. Part of this had to do with the artistic presentation to be original, but for me it was the character usage that took away from the plot the most. So many promising characters she engaged with were limited in names, back story, and even emotional depth for me that they were almost negligible. Sure, each character presented something of the lead's life, but only fell into the background to try and keep track on what I think the film's real focus. Even the antagonists held little names, threat, and development, reduced to a realistic farce of what the usual antagonists of films like these are, but this forced background information, though late, was nice to see to help close the tale. Regardless, this limited tale you might hope has a fulfilling ending and in a way it does, but again depends on what you expect going into the film. On one side, you will feel some great justice, pride, and vindication for how the film ends, the messages, closure, and symbolism/representation so high you'll be beaming with pride. Yet, if you go in expecting that suspenseful, on the edge of your seat finale where characters are pushed to the brink, then lower the expectations because it is not that thrilling, engaging, or exciting for this reviewer. Simplistic sneaking around, some very lackluster and off balanced fighting, and monologues that do little to scare and build suspense are what await the eager horror person at this point.
In terms of the scary element of the film, you can guess that I was not chilled, disturbed, or creeped out by the ""horror"" element, outside of the realism this film held. The scary elements were more vicious bouts of violence, where the uncomfortable abuse factors are hard to watch at points, alongside some of the consequences that result. As I've said/hinted, the film really dilutes the horror element by instead choosing to go down the political drama avenue that I knew would be integrated, but not this prominent. Antebellum's writing, character usage, visualization, and twists are all on track for the current political hot trend track that social media seems to eat up these days. The writing in particular is a bit too in your face for me, going overboard to push the agenda and in doing so drop the mystery, horror, and much of the thriller aspect for me. While I agree the message is important, I'm not a fan of the modern trend of message over storytelling, so I can't say that that aspect alone is deserving of a high grade.The VERDICT:Let's wrap this up. Antebellum is definitely a disguised movie that teases horror, intrigue and mystery, but turns out to be more of a strong suited political drama with little else embedded in its backbone. The majorly talented Monae executes her role fantastically, hitting so many designs and directions that I could not help but be impressed with her skills as an actress. While the original presentation, visual elements, and sound editing are also strong aspects of the film, they don't help the pacing of the movie, barely establish the horror elements, and do nothing to improve the limited character/developed story of this film. As such, unless you need a new approach to the political movements of the day, this film is best left to cheaper renting later on down the line, and filling your day with HBO Max series like Lovecraft country instead.My scores for this film are:Horror/mystery/Thriller: 6.0

32,Foutainoflife,No Doubt This Is A Divisive Film And You Can Easily See That In The Reviews,7,19 September 2020,"Ok. So there are a lot of people taking issue with this due to the current politial environment in the US, some are taking issue with it because they feel it is a ""The Village"" remake and some are taking issue with it because they see it more as a thriller than horror. I guess you will decide how you like it based on your position concerning these issues.In terms of our political environment, things are not good. I am a Southerner. I've heard the arguments for both the destruction of heritage and the continued insult of the treatment of African Americans. It is a sensitive topic for which, I have no ideas on how to appease everyone. So, in choosing to watch this, I decided to lay personal opinions to the side so that I could watch what was being presented without prejudice.As for this being a ""The Village"" remake. Yeah, I'm not on board with this at all. In ""The Village,"" the circumstances of the village founders are far different. They raise children who are unaware of the world beyond the boundaries of the village of their birth. They are naive and brainwashed. This film is different and not really comparable in my opinion.As to whether it is horror or not, well if this happened to me, I would be horrified. Kidnappings, torture, murder and the dehumanization of others is monstrous. To imply that these are merely ""suspensful"" or ""thrilling"" topics alone shows a removal from the realization that, while watching it in a film, it is meant to portray something happening in real time to real people and will steal from the horror of it. Although it lacks the blood, guts and gore of hardcore horror, this is a psychological horror film if you are open minded enough to experience it. It is chilling.I review films as I see them and while I'm sure that with such a divisive film I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this, it will have no bearing on my opinion. I say if you are interested in seeing this, don't let the negative reviews deter you. Watch it and come to your own conclusion. It is a well made film and I thought the acting was good. Subject matter is sensitive, political and divisive but overall I thought the story was rather unique.Check it out and make up your own mind as to whether you like it.",Antebellum
33,arungeorge13,"If the trailer piqued your interest, the film will seem like a half-hearted effort! [+47%]",5,19 September 2020,"I'll admit that the trailer had me intrigued in a weird sci-fi, time-travel nightmare sort of way. But the end product, while polished in looks, lacks the emotional core to carry it all the way through. Antebellum seems tailor-made to feed the audiences that welcomed ""Get Out"" with open arms, however, the difference here is that ""Get Out"" was envisioned (and scripted) strongly. This, on the other hand, utilizes the horrors of black slavery as generic horror movie tropes. And what's worse, it does so in an unconvincing manner.The film can be segregated into 3 acts, told in a non-chronological fashion. While the first act is a slow-burn exercise in 1800s slavery that features Eden (Monae) and several other black people being brutalized by Confederates, the second jumps to the present featuring Veronica (Monae, again) who's a feminist fighting for inclusion, and the third where these two timelines begin to blend. Treated with subtlety, Antebellum could have been a splendid film. But the third act is this film's undoing. It embraces a twist that comes out of nowhere; one that undermines the real-life horrors of slavery the first act so eloquently echoed.Writer-director duo Bush & Renz appear to be more interested in the shock value offering of their late twist than its possibilities of creating tonal inconsistencies. Therefore, we get an elaborate (makes-no-sense) action set-piece at the end which wraps things up in a humdrum way. The director-duo's fixation on music-video-like visuals (and slow-motion) is evident in the opening and closing stretches. In a better executed film, these would have been considered cinematic flourishes. In Antebellum, they simply look out of place. And yes, Monae deserves better!",Antebellum

Intriguing concept, overly mediocre execution with some unintentionally goofy moments, strained performances but gorgeous cinematography and a great score. As implausible as it is conceptually it's ambitious and does spark conversation but it's kind of all over the place and never decides on what kind of movie it wants to be to it's own detriment.

37,gedikreverdi,Past is not even past,7,12 July 2021,Antebellum the civil war re-enactment park! Apparently you either love this or hate it. I am one of those who really liked it. The only place I wasn't so fond of was Veronica traveling and dining out with the girls and all as it seemed a bit irrelevant to the story because it was a bit too long for learning about how their normal lives was before being abducted. Then she was abducted by the driver whom she thought her Uber. I thought it'd be about time travel or even the US was two countries after the civil war and they're in the southern country. But it really caught me off guard. It started with too much torture scenes and I really didn't like seeing the Black individuals being tortured even if it is only a film. But thankfully it didn't go on like that. The woman who hanged herself looked so modern to me and I thought it's such a mistake that she was speaking like a modern individual and now I get it. Veronica as the racist called him Eden used the phone of the soldier that's sleeping with him while he's asleep. The rehearsal of her escape by avoiding the creaking parts of the floor and all was really good. She couldn't save the professor who was about to escape with her but she cremated those wannabe confederate soldiers alive and she dragged her rapist with the confederate flag to the crematorium. She the wear the blue uniform and rode the horse. The racist woman whose father abducted Veronica chased her and Veronica lassoed her and dragged her on the ground until she hit some concrete and died. Then she arrived the warfront scene with an axe in her hand and people were taking her photos thinking it's a part of the re-enactments.

39,rockman182,Antebellum (2020),6,24 September 2020,"Pre-pandemic, I remember seeing trailers for this in the theater and thought it looked intriguing. Couldn't really decipher what the film was going to be about based on it. I'm glad it was released digitally, more studios should just be doing that at this point. Anyways, I had the opportunity to check it out and while I do admire the concept I didn't think the film leaves the impression that it wanted to. However, I will see the lead performance from Janelle Monae is jut great and I'd love to see her more in film.
The film is going to be really hard to describe without giving away key plot points so I'll keep it minimum. Lets just describe it as a young slave who experiences truly horrible atrocities on a plantation and tries to devise ways to escape her situation. Though his character is pretty despicable in this, I'm glad to see Jack Huston get work as he was probably my favorite part of Boardwalk Empire.
As mentioned earlier the film fails to live up to the potential it creates. Midway, through you are truly intrigued with what is going on and even the twist at the end is pretty good. I'm not bothered by shocking twists and reveals if its done well and serves the plot well. I feel like there needed to be more substance in this film to really warrant its existence. It does well to build up its atmosphere and show how brutal Plantation's were and the treatment slaves receive but it doesn't act well on its premise.The middle section feels out of place and while its supposed to feel that way I suppose, it doesn't really connect the passages and definitely could have been written better. It also drags and all around adds to the unevenness of a film that could have made a real point but doesn't. Still, Janelle Monae is really good in this and really increases how watchable it is. She needs to get more work because she has knocked it out of the park in every role shes done. Overall, this will divide and polarize. There are enjoyable aspects but it feels so flawed because you know how good it could have been.6/10",Antebellum
40,bankofmarquis,Monae shines - the rest falls flat,5,12 October 2020,"One of the films that I circled on my calendar back in the beginning of 2020 was a trippy looking ""Civil War anachronism"" film (my term) ANTEBELLUM starring Janelle Monae. I'm a sucker for these kinds of films, so was a little sad that I couldn't see it in the theater, but was thrilled when this ""horror film"" debuted on pay-per-view in time for Halloween.I now know why the producers of this film decided to get this out now vs. waiting to release it theatrically sometime in 2021.Billed as ""Jordan Peel's GET OUT meets an M. Night Shyamalan film"", ANTEBELLUM is a movie told in 3 acts. In the first act, Janelle Monae's character (who is given the slave name Eden) is brought into a Southern, Antebellum, plantation. This part of the film shows the desperation and despair that slaves lived in at a time that they had no rights and were under the whims of their White Slave Owners. The character of Eden is fiesty and is constantly looking to escape, but...eventually...is worn down by her masters and capitulates...to a point. This is the most successful part of this film, but has been better covered in other films like 12 YEARS A SLAVE.The 2nd part of this movie takes place in ""modern day"" and concerns a successful author, Veronica Henley (also played by Monae). This character specializes in books and motivational speeches designed to empower the African-American woman. This part of the movie highlights Monae's appeal as a screen presence and she overcomes some weak writing to rise above. This part of the film, ultimately, falls flat for me, but I was curious as to how these 2 very different pieces of this movie fit together.The 3rd part of this movie answers that question. If only, it answered it better....for pieces of this part of the movie works well...but others fall very, very flat resulting, ultimately, in a less than satisfying film-going experience that could have used some further work.Monae's performance (for the most part) shines in this movie. She handles both characters that she is playing in a sharp, charismatic way. I could really buy that she is a popular ""motivational"" speaker (in the modern part of the movie). I could also see the fire in her spirit during the ""Antebellum"" part. What I didn't buy (and a weakness in the script doesn't help this part) is her ""capitulation"" to her slave owners.And...that's about if for performances that stood out. All of the white actors playing the slave owners (mainly Eric Lange, Jena Malone and Jack Huston) are capital ""E"" evil. While this is probably historically accurate, they weren't evil enough - or multi-dimensional enough - to keep my attention. Compounding that issue is that the other characters in the ""modern part"" of the film are very generic and forgettable.And then we get to the 3rd part of this film - where the first 2 parts are melded together.It is one of those types of storytelling tropes that either you ""go with it"" or you don't. If you don't, the movie will lose you right there. If you do (and I did), then it is an interesting place to go and blends the first 2 parts of the film ""well enough"". My problem is that I didn't care enough about the characters to care about what happens.I lay the blame of this on filmmakers Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz. They co-wrote and co-directed this movie. I had never heard of them, or (I don't think) I've encountered their work before, but upon reading up on them, they are listed as ""Visionary Filmmakers Bush+Renz"". If they are visionaries, they sure didn't bring much vision here. It was all pretty straightforward and could have used some other kind of ""visionary"" to lift this movie to a higher level.You know, like Jordan Peele or even M. Night Shyamalan.Letter Grade C+5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Antebellum
41,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,"Outstanding cinematography, Twilight Zone Ron Serling worthy.",9,19 September 2020,"From the very opening scene this film grabs your attention. The cinematography and the soundtrack of the opening scene is absolutely brilliant, outstanding and emotional. The first thought that will come into your head is, ""Wait, is this a horror film or a historical civil war drama?"" That's what I found was so amazing about this film in that it completely misleads the viewer in the beginning. But if you ever loved the Twilight Zone anthology series with Ron Serling, you will be in for a treat because this film isn't at all what it seems.I won't give the twist away because this film can easily be ruined if the twist is unveiled before watching the film. All I will say is the director and technical crew really know how to pull the emotional nerves, at least during the plantation scenes. The modern day portion of the film I personally didn't care for but after watching until the end I understood why they added it in there. It's just the plantation scenes made this film feel like a much higher budget film than it really was. As an old Twilight Zone fan I can really appreciate this film.",Antebellum
42,Sir_AmirSyarif,Fails to live up to its great premise,5,7 February 2021,"Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz's feature directorial debut, 'Antebellum,' wants to make a point about racism and the evils of white supremacy: They were prevalent during the Civil War and still continue to this day. The movie sets up an interesting premise, but it fails to deliver due to its shallow script and weak direction. Serviceable in its presentation and supported by truly breathtaking performances from its entire cast, but still can't quite save the whole experience.",Antebellum
43,kuarinofu,Oscar vehicle mismarketed as a horror film,4,19 September 2020,"Structurally Antebellum is a re-make of Shyamalan's The Village with some elements of Get Out.The first 40 minutes are just beautifully shot Oscars material (with typical stereotypes that seriously boost your chances of winning an oscar, like maniacal misogynistic white men rapists), then around 30 minutes of overacting and boring dialogue on the current political agenda. At times the film looks like it's trying to be smart and dive deeper into the ongoing social issues, but no, not really. It is very much surface level.The story finally picks up in the last 20 minutes or so, by that time the resolution becomes obvious and you're just waiting for the film to wrap up.There is some clever writing and good cinematography in this, but in the end, it turns into a very simplistic story made only to gain free points and awards.I mostly skip politically fueled oscar vehicles because I don't enjoy my mind being assaulted by surface-level propaganda, so I watched it only because it was mismarketed as a horror film, I can't say I'm disappointed, but it had the potential of being something more complicated and deep, but instead, they just wasted time on comical acting and horrendous dialogue.",Antebellum

This could have been written much better. The transition did not work it was sloppy. Honestly I had no idea what I was watching. when they move to modern times it blew my mind, no proper transition sequence or anything.. When the movie was over I asked myself "" What the hell had i just wasted my time on? Of course this is only my opinion and not trying to rain on anyone's parade. I hated it! The twist was terrible but I think that the movie would've worked better if the characters were more fleshed out and it's terrible. I was expecting a horror/mystery flick but instead I got a modern day Roots flick. There really wasn't a suspenseful moment in the entire movie and I actually got bored at several points.",Antebellum

46,msbreviews,"Antebellum is set to divide viewers due to its depiction of extreme violence. Fortunately, I ended up in the positive side!",7,5 October 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Some media outlets are providing a spoiler-ish synopsis that I believe the film should have omitted throughout its marketing campaign, including its own trailers. There's a central mystery that only begins almost midway through the runtime, and it plays out until the start of the third act, so you have my advice: stay away from its trailers and don't read too many synopses. Since I didn't know anything about it, I watched Antebellum with modest expectations, and most important of all, without any preconceived ideas or theories about its narrative structure.However, I couldn't help but see the movie later than most people, and I have to admit: I'm slightly surprised that so many people deeply hate this film... It does have some issues, and I'll get to those, but overall, I believe the extreme White-on-Black violence is the main reason why so many viewers gave up on the movie. I'll start with this topic. It's indisputable that Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz (feature directorial debuts) deliver quite a shocking film, depicting racism and slavery in unpleasant yet realistic ways. This last part is precisely the seamless balance that every movie needs to have when dealing with these themes, and in my opinion, Bush and Renz didn't really nail it.The brutal torture and death sequences that Black people suffer in this film are shown without any restraint. From massive amounts of blood to visible hits, it's one of those movies that carries so much realism that it becomes uncomfortable. If these scenes end up carrying a meaningful message or a compelling arc, it might be hard to watch, but it ultimately feels necessary and emotionally impactful. If they don't, then it just looks like violence for the sake of entertainment, which will always bother a lot of viewers depending on the type of violence on display. Bush and Renz risk the film's success walking this thin line, and overall, even though they're far from perfecting that balance, they didn't do a bad job, at all.In fact, for a directorial debut, Antebellum is technically remarkable. Opening with an uncut, long opening sequence, where the camera shows the entire plantation, passing through the recent arrival of Janelle Monáe's character, and finishing in a horrendous slow-motion treatment of a desperate slave trying to escape. These six to eight minutes function like a disclaimer to the audience. If people feel way too disturbed by what they've just witnessed, then it's better to leave this one on the side, and forget about it.Pedro Luque's cinematography feels definitely unique, and it never shies away from displaying what's happening, no matter how gruesome and terrible. The musical score from Nate Wonder and Roman Gianarthur, characterized by its dominant use of strings, elevates so many suspenseful moments. Honestly, it's pretty addictive to listen to. Great production value, as expected, costume and set design are fantastic... visually, I find nothing to complain about. Even judging the brutality solely on itself, if the purpose is to demonstrate how much slaves suffered back then, it's as faithful as it could be.Story-wise, Bush and Renz need to improve their quality as screenwriters. Their premise is extremely convincing, the nonlinear narrative structure adds a neat mystery, and the story itself is incredibly intriguing. However, instead of reaching its undeniable potential and delivering a phenomenal, profound, well-developed screenplay, Antebellum ends up in a predictable manner, leaving tons of interesting storylines to explore. Even its climactic, action-heavy final minutes are underwhelming, and every problem is solved way too easily. It even gives the viewer the right to question why and how everything that happens in the movie could, in fact, occur for so long.Nevertheless, it's far from being a trainwreck, much on the contrary. I was invested until the very end, almost every scene is captivating to the point of me staying completely still without taking my eyes off the screen. I didn't feel too uncomfortable with the display of violence, so my experience was smoother than most people, I'd assume. The excellent representation of Janelle Monáe's character's distinct lifestyles, in the plantation and in the city, is the best aspect of the entire film, clearly setting up a different color palette and tone. Monáe offers a powerful performance, carrying the whole movie on her shoulders, as the sole protagonist of an incredibly heavy story.All in all, Antebellum is set to divide viewers due to its uncomfortable yet realistic, extreme violence. Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz deliver an undeniably shocking film, involving hard-to-watch depictions of torture, slavery, and racism. Technically, the camera work gives the whole movie a distinct style, as well as its score, costumes, and set design. Janelle Monáe demonstrates her acting abilities as the protagonist, delivering an emotionally captivating display. The nonlinear narrative structure elevates the central mystery, but the story doesn't receive the extensive treatment that its premise deserves. The enormous potential is wasted in meaningless, horrific deaths, just as in the third act's disappointing action sequences. While the White-on-Black violence is justified in the context of the film, its excessive, unrestrained display without a convincing message or arc surrounding it is definitely a negative aspect that some people won't be able to accept. I didn't feel bothered to that level, and I still believe the intent was benign, so I recommend this directorial debut from Bush and Renz, but with a disclaimer for the sensitive subject matter and/or viewers who struggle with depictions of intense violence.Rating: B",Antebellum
47,Stanlee107,Feed the hate,2,20 September 2020,"Omg this film is just bad. Why make a film that is horrific for the sake of it?! The message is...surprise, surprise: that racism exist in modern day societies. This is something that the most extremist of the BLM movement might push out to strike the flames of today's injustice. It is a type of film Spike Lee might have made. I don't know who would enjoy watching this type of film?",Antebellum
48,johannes2000-1,"Cinematographically brilliant, with a harsh message.",10,16 September 2020,"I was blown away by this movie. First there's the message, it's heavy and cynical, it's #blacklivesmatter smacking you right in the face and belly. As a North-European white man I hardly dare to pretend to know anything of what black people in America have to cope with, I guess (and sure hope!) that this movie has enlarged it for the sake of the argument. But it chilled me to the bone watching all the goings-on in the first half hour, even thinking (unjustified, as it turned out) that this was all in the past. If just a fraction of the frame of mind that could make such a violent and degrading attitude towards black people is a reality today, then there are still mountains of prejudice and hate to be demolished.But there's more to this movie. I really think it's cinematographically brilliant. The various shifts in perspective that came (to me at least) as total surprises and every time hit me like a rock, up to the last one in more or less the last scenes. The haunting musical score, bleak and unnerving and more and more building up the tension. The stunning opening sequence of some 10 minutes, in one seamless take that gradually brings you from an almost idyllic atmosphere into unbridled violence. The numerous seemingly casual but oh so intelligent details, like the flirting guy coming over to the table of the girlfriends and the camera never raising its point of view above his waist. The scenes in the hotel, heavy with foreboding and almost unbearable tension, reminding me of Brian de Palma movies.And then there's in my opinion yet another side to this movie, a second message. Gabourey Sidibe's character Dawn reacts extremely condescending to the guy that comes to pay her a compliment, and in the taxi her actions to the driver feel awkward and definitely crossing the #metoo borders. And heroine Veronica/Eden (Janelle Monáe) reacts to her tormenters with almost the same relentless violence as she had to endure. The movie obviously wants to show that there is not a hard unsurpassable line between good and bad and everyone can be driven to objectionable behavior, either by being pushed to the limits, by stupidity or by sheer lack of insight. So a movie like this (or movements like #blacklivesmatter) seem like a good thing if they can lead to more insight, empathy and mutual respect between people. These words sound so easy but apparently living them is the hardest thing ever.",Antebellum

50,sweidman-28016,Trying Too Hard to Be a Jordan Peele and Shyamalan Movie,4,1 October 2020,"""The unresolved past can certainly wreak havoc on the present.""Oh no. What happened here? Honestly, from the trailers this looked like it would be something interesting. Maybe not the most amazing movie ever but at least something fine. It could be the competition to make a movie better than Jordan Peele, but Antebellum is trying to be something smarter than it actually is. While trying to make a statement about social issues on racism, the message comes out more basic. Much like Green Book, the message says, ""Racism is bad and it needs to end!"" Though many have mixed feelings on it after the controversy and how it really didn't say much else than that statement, Green Book had structure and an engaging story. Antebellum can't even do that.To engage audiences, the movie has major twists. Many, myself included, have compared these twists to an M. Night Shyamalan movie. I don't know whether to say who did it better but Antebellum failed to make the twists as mind blowing as The Sixth Sense it even The Village. The first attempt as a twist made me laugh because I thought they were doing something else. Luckily what we think is happening actually isn't happening. But it's not that great either.I questioned what was actually happening so much in the second act that I couldn't stop watching. I didn't mind the second act too much. It's far more interesting than the first act. I might get some hate for criticizing the first act, but it did nothing special. They made the most basic slavery movie right there with the script and what is happening. Not that what we're watching isn't extremely disappointing to watch in U.S. history, but no attempt is made to make something greater if it. The third act is just a mess. Once everything comes together it's sort of unbelievable what we're watching. And the message that's made maybe came off the wrong foot, I hope. If they intended to make a statement through this revenge aspect it's maybe not the best way to put it. Honestly I was concerned. Anyway, the final moments are just crazy. A heroic moment is just more confusing or something. I honestly just have no words because I don't know how to describe everything.This is disappointing because there's a waste of talent. All of the performances are actually pretty good. Going in I didn't realize Jena Malone had a part. It's always great to see her in a movie because she's a wonderful actress. And for Janelle Monáe this could've been a movie to send her into Hollywood's eye. She hasn't been in too many movies and Antebellum is her first lead. She really nails the role. I'd even consider her in the top ten actress performances of the year. But it's sad since this is a train wreck. The cinematography looks great, especially the final moments. The score is good. Technically and acting-wise, a good movie. Directing and writing-wise, awful. It's for the best that this went to VOD.

56,fciocca,"Good premises and overall a nice message, but the movie goes downhill halfway through and the ending is just rushed and no sense",4,21 October 2020,"Antebellum is a movie about racism and how much this still affects the life of many, many people that fight every day to obtain equal rights, and this the main message of the movie. It is in fact important that all form of media keeps to sensibilize people on the topic, but you need to create at least a decent story. The premises are good, there is a lot of mistery around the plot, you don't really understand what is happening and the movie kept me interested until halfway then boring dialogues and long, stretched scenes start to appear. One example is when the main character Veronica speaks with her two friends in a restaurant. The scene goes on several minutes and leads absolutely nowhere.I was expecting an absolute bomb related to the plot twist, instead is pretty disappointing. The racism topic is treated in a different way that makes you think about the past, many progress have been done, but we have still lot of work to do ahead, in order to improve our society. If you are into this kind of stuff, maybe you will enjoy. If nit, you will be bored very soon.Antebellum manages more or less to stay afloat, thanks also to a cast formed by really good actors, unfortunately the very end does not make any sense.

Director: Gerard Bush and Christopher Renz
Starring: Janelle Monae, Eric Lange, Jena Malone, Jack Huston, Tongayi Chirisa, Kiersey Clemons, Gabourey Sidibe etc.Overall rating 27/100Antebellum is about a successful author Veronica Henley (Janelle Monae) who finds herself trapped in a horrifying reality and must uncover the mind bending mystery before its too late. What an absolute mess of a movie from start to finish, Antebellum did not live up to the potential of its premise at all and is one of the most poorly written films I have seen in a while, so lets get started.Let's be nice and start with some of the very few positives. The cinematography was great, the movie executed a good dark and uncomfortable tone, and executed some dark themes well. The movie was visually fantastic, there was some really powerful imagery that was excellently crafted and the set locations were incredibly realistic and beautiful, truly deceiving the audience into thinking this was set many, many years ago when slavery unfortunately still existed. I also thought that the movie managed to execute an extremely dark and uncomfortable tone, they managed to bring to life the disgusting racism that white people had and how they treated black people like they were nothing and beneath them was truly disturbing and frightening to watch as people used to behave like this, so therefore the movie did for the most part execute its themes on racism and how far we have come in terms of battling racism, but also balancing that with how there is still so much more to do was well done.My first few negatives would be the confusing opening with lack of establishing of characters or plot, the lack of clear structure, lack of focus on the main character and really bad pacing issues. The opening for me was just completely confusing and badly structured, they film opened with a bunch of dark sequences without any form of explanation into the plot or what was going on, or any form of set up or background or information on any of the characters, it was just oddly structured and instantly made the film feel slightly off for me. I also thought that there was a lack of clear structure throughout the movie, there wasn't enough story beats that were hit or even explained in detail enough, this made the whole movie feel clunky for me, and how it would switch between the two different versions of the main character with no explanation just made the structure messy and was poorly written. I did also feel as if there was a lack of focus on the main character, she often until the final act felt like an afterthought due to the large supporting cast, it didn't help that she was fairly passive and didn't react to certain things as much as she should have, it made it really difficult to connect with the character or the film as a whole. Adding on from my previous point about the poor structure of the movie, this also really badly effected the pacing. It was messy, clunky and all over the place, often feeling rushed and unexplained and got me confused about what was happening on multiple occasions and I like to think I can keep up with movie most of the time, but this was just so poorly explained I often just couldn't.My next few negatives would be the lack of explanation to plot points, the poorly structured plot/tonal changes. The unneeded characters, lack of tension and scares, as well as the over reliance on shock factor. The movie just didn't bother to explain so many key plot points, it was basically just lazily written. And for such a high concept movie this in turn made the premise lose its promise very quickly, there was next to no explanation into the connection between both versions/realities of Janelle Monae's character and way too often just felt like two completely different movies. This is why the sudden plot and tonal changes were just so confusing and out of place, they never explained why they were happening what tense both situations were happening, it just felt like a very jarring and poorly placed tonal and plot change, and the fact that initially it was treated a bad dream was a mind boggling moment, the movie just felt very tonally confused and didn't know what it wanted to be, having elements of Drama, sci fi, thriller, horror and mystery and none of them blending well at all. I also felt like there was a lot of unneeded characters within the film, there was often characters introduced that often felt like they were there to fill the time and never truly contributed anything towards the movie as a whole, if they were cut more focus could have been put on developing the plot so it was understandable. I also thought that the movie had a complete lack of tension and scares. For a film so heavily marketed as a horror and with the creative minds of get out and us stamped all over the poster, the movie was not scary at all, there was no jumpscares and no real building of tension, there was a series of disturbing imagery and instances that made you feel uncomfortable but never tense or scared. Finally, I also thought the movie over relied on shock factor. I felt like the movie was relying to much on being shocking and showing uncomfortable scenes linking to slavery and how people of colour were treated, this was effective and held its impact for a while but then that was all the movie had to offer, it didn't show versatility and overelied on these shocking scenes with unneeded characters and scenes.My final few positives would be the performances and the humour. I thought that Janelle Monae's performance was absolutely fantastic and she was the best part of the movie. Despite the poor material she was given she tried her hardest, her performance was moving and powerful. She really conveyed the fear of her character so well it was believable and she should definitely get more work out of this because she is a very talented actress and singer. I also do have to give a shout out to Gabourey Sidibe, she was absolutely fantastic and stole every scene she was in, she not only provided some much needed comedic relief she shone in every scene that she was in her charisma and charm.Now it's time for my final few negatives. The film had a messy script, a lack of character depth or development. I had no connection to the characters, the movie had very generic elements and a lack of mystery, as well as a terrible ending. The movies script was just a mess, the dialogue was mediocre at best and they just contrasted such a deep idea and somehow made it the complete opposite, for me it was just lazily written and one of the worst scripts I have seen in a long time. There was also a complete lack of character development and depth, we knew hardly anything beyond surface level or brief explanations about the main character or any of the cast, and none of the characters really had any development or arc apart from one goal to escape the slave camp. This therefore made me had no connection to the characters, I unfortunate just didn't care and the movie made no effort to the characters and was just focused on causing shock. I also thought that the movie had a lot of generic moments, the moments that were intended to be scary were so recycled it managed to cause the complete opposite effect, having genre tropes of a creepy little girl and similar things like that just isn't original and the movie didn't even try to do something different with it. I also thought that the movie had a complete lack of mystery and therefore a bad ending, the movie just didn't explain absolutely anything about the villains and why they were taking people or their connections to both realities/tenses, so therefore they made no effort to build a mystery and completely rushed over anything, this just made the ending very bad and anticlimactic for me as there was no real explanation into the villains or why the characters were there or even a reunion with the main character and her husband.Overall, Antebellum has great cinematography and fantastic performances from Janelle Monae and Gabourey Sidibe. But that couldn't save this movie. It was messy, tonally confused. Extremely poorly written, often just feeling like two separate movies with a lack of connecting the dots. Thinly written characters, and despite its best intentions with its themes and messages it failed on almost every level to actually get those messages across effectively.",Antebellum
58,movieman6-413-929510,Music video clip directors turn their first cinema film into a messy unoriginal film.,4,5 September 2020,"Antebellum is a new horror thriller directed, written and produced in part by Gerard Bush and Christopher Renze. This is only their first real cinema film that they have directed together. For this they have made more short films, especially music video clips.The film is about the successful writer Veronica Henley (Janelle Monáe). She is confronted with her success by the world. She must fight the dark past and escape it before it's too late.The fact that this is the first cinema film that Gerard Bush and Christopher Renze have made is reflected in the film. The film seems to start with a clear beginning, but the plot twists that emerge later in the film only get messier and unclear. The story of the movie is somewhat like an adapted, copied version of the story of the movie Get Out. The few minor horror aspects of the movie seem to have been copied from the movie The Shining. The movie poster of this movie is even copied from the movie poster of The Silence of the Lambs.Despite the fact that the film does not have an original story, they try to incorporate a good message that responds to the current events of Black Lives Matter. This message would have come across better with a clearer script. For a better film that responds to the same current events, you better look back at Get Out. Instead of a scary horror film, the film also comes across as a fierce thriller with a history about the racism of slavery and how racism is still a problem in the world today.Due to the messy script, most of the cast do not deliver any special acting and they have all acted better in other films thanks to clearer scripts of these other films.",Antebellum
59,haroot_azarian,Superb and very relevant,10,12 November 2020,"Contrary to a lot of critiques, I think the movie was superb and very relevant to our times, a very polarized America where far-right white supremacists have been enabled and emboldened in the last four years!

It really fell flat in a lot of places and sailed that way through the whole film. It had a flaccid ending that was actually quite laughable. And the 'twist'? Not good enough for my liking.

62,zac-04879,"Doesn't Meet the Standards for the Horror Genre, But is Very Thrilling",6,14 July 2021,"Don't have too high anticipations about this interesting psychological thriller graphically depicting slavery, half moving and half unhurried. But the film needs your full attention for you to properly understand and enjoy it. Obviously Antebellum is a film a lot of audiences will find disappointing and not suitably produced. It kind of is just a poor execution, but the story is engrossing despite the boring sections of it.What's also entirely horrific in Antebellum is definitely the slavery. The acting and effects make it all sense intensely realistic, horrifying, graphic and clever. This evidently proves it's too disturbing for kids, but everyone will find the film torturing and difficult to witness. There's only certain ingredients that make this horror-thriller disturbingly captivating. And that includes the performances within the dreadful portrayals of slavery and torture, as well as the intelligent writing and fearful visuals. Other than that, the fierce slavery takes up half the film's pace leaving the rest to the slow-burning story set in the rational present. However, Antebellum is almost everything that fans of wounding psychological thrillers could want.This appealing flick is also more of a thriller than a horror; it's grippingly riveting, surprisingly twisted and incredibly thrilling, but is not actually scary. You'll also find that the trailer is quite delusive and you won't get what you're expecting.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Antebellum

It had nothing to say... and it said it loudly.",Antebellum
64,TheVictoriousV,"Confused, facile, and often quite pretty to look at",4,10 October 2020,"Anything I could say about Antebellum, its title most surely a clue on what's next in Trump's America, would be overruled (in the target audience's brains) by the insuperable sexiness of Janelle Monáe and the inspiration she gives those who share her superficial characteristics (which, at the rate education is going, they may think is the same as sharing the history of the figure she portrays - the film is unintentionally on-point in how it places this present-day heroine in a Civil War era setting by force). Whether or not these viewers deserve better is irrelevant; they don't want better.Antebellum wants in on what Jordan Peele is doing; translating contemporary racial tensions (inspired, inevitably, by past sins) into extranormal horror scenarios. However, these filmmakers are not as gifted as Peele, neither in terms of crafting an atmosphere through the technical aspects, nor in terms of delivering themes effectively - even as Peele himself can get wonky on that last one.I don't think only persons of color will like this movie, of course; no doubt a few ""allied"" journalism graduates will get in on the praise, and me personally, I had fun with some of the mind-bending spoop moments and quite enjoy Monáe as a performer. I even liked her over-the-top Oscars number earlier this year.But the movie does kinda play into skin-deep identity politics. I saw someone comment on the fact that The National Review, a jilariously conservative outlet, had very predictably panned the film, stating the people at National Review must surely be ""afraid of us"". I'm wondering if they used the pronoun ""us"" to mean either queer black women or African-Americans, the latter of which is extra funny since the chief of film critique at National Review is, of course, Armond White - a black homosexual man. You see how it's not always as simple as Instagram activists make it sound? You see how other black viewers might feel pandered to, if not outright exploited?As biased as White may be, and as much as the above-mentioned stans will go ""YASSS"" at Monáe vanquishing her oppressors (played by the likes of Jena Malone, Jack Huston, and Eric Lange as ""Him""), many other critics are wondering what the film's larger point is, seeing past the ultimately shallow empowerment and spooky gore. Has it maybe, I dunno, shot itself in the foot?It likely wants to say something about racism today and how some people in power would no doubt like to see America go back to slavery - especially given how protective they are of monuments that resemble slavers, not to mention police brutality. However, I maintain that you could ""accidentally"" read the movie as a metaphor for reductive historical analysis, forcing a successful modern woman to walk in the shoes of a slave lady because... well, you know.Angry YouTube Men are going to have some fun with this one, methinks, even if they're among the people that Antebellum thinks it's ""stickin' it to""; maybe they think this proves that toppling over statues of literal slave-owners is contributing to historical illiteracy (I definitely agree that people have gotten sloppy at homework but I think we can do without the carved tributes to slavers). Expect a roast from Geeks+Gamers (a YouTuber whose moniker I'm sure is meant to also describe the contemporary authorities on racial politics) very soon.I guess the following rings true no matter what: people will see this picture and money will be made.As a horror romp, which is what I ought to be judging it as when I use it for my annual horror-thon, Antebellum is serviceable in its presentation, SFX, and tone. But when a film wants to seem like it's saying something (because we're in a year where it's extra lucrative to do so), and it either fails to say that thing or come off like it's instead saying something counterintuitive, that's what I'll get hung up on. Also, I am very sorry for citing Armond White.",Antebellum
65,Michael Fargo,Exploiting the horror of slavery,2,9 February 2021,"I'm not sure that anyone who went to high school and took an American history class hasn't spent time considering the horror of being torn from the comfort of your life and family, chained and put on a ship, then sold and dehumanized to serve and be brutalized by slavery in the United States. If the filmmakers need to tell that story again--rather than exploit it--some thought needs to go into it. And in ""Antebellum"" there is some indication that this story has something different, telling a 3 ""act"" story of its central character Eden, enslaved and brutalized along with others on a plantation in the U.S. South. The filmmakers captured the brutalization and murders with conviction.Unfortunately, the screenplay gives the considerable acting and production talent in this film nothing but platitudes to say, particularly in the second or middle ""act"" of the film. Janelle Monáe owns the camera whenever she appears. But the characters of a happy, exceptionally successful family ring so false with the cheerful adoring husband, the perfect child all decked out in an impossibly neat penthouse, and everyone sporting the highest fashion, trying to mimic what it means to be successful and ""intellectual,"" as if conflict doesn't exist in family life or success (particularly in academia) isn't hard won and demanding. Any strength the entire film has is eradicated by how trite and superficial the ""real"" world of overcoming the economic limitations in a prejudiced society is depicted. Worse, the misuse of Gabourey Sidibe's considerable strengths imply that equality means you can demand how others treat you in the guise of rudeness and self-involvement and overt sexual exploitation. (Not cool, at all.)While there was possibility in this material, ""Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"" used its premise to much greater and more pointed effect. Images from contemporary America are hastily and thoughtlessly grabbed and stuffed into the film. A statue of Robert E. Lee which in the news was concrete (or bronze) evidence of the egregious abuse of racism's scourge in contemporary America, and militias which almost over-turned the U.S. Constitution are used in the film like cardboard cutouts.The final frames of the film which point to a good portion of America's obsession with reenacting its Civil War as if the wrong side won, is marketed by the economic system to suggest ""The South will rise again"" is wildly offensive--particularly when the filmmakers likely had the opposite idea in mind. The whole effort of the film becomes as sadistic and pornographic as those who revere the enslavement of a race of people.",Antebellum
66,mr_bickle_the_pickle,I dont get the low scores,8,18 September 2020,"I honestly dont understand why this has such a low rating except maybe for the fact that some white people upset that white people being portrayed as the villains. Or is it because its another slave movie? I've also seen some people complain that its not really a horror like its advertised, and ok...it does feel ,more like a thriller than a true horror but that doesnt make it less captivating. I was really invested in Eden/Veronica and the mystery of how she's seemingly in the 1800s deep south. The twist isnt super complicated, I was able to make a guess that turned out right. But again, this didnt detract from my enjoyment of the film. I thought it had a very interesting storyline. I wont say the film the is perfect. Jena Malone (especially during the last act) does a bit of scenery chewing as the villain. I also thought the end in general with Eden/Veronica riding on horseback in slow-mo felt a little hokey. It was maybe a little confusing why Eden/Veronica was made out to be the ""saviour"". I get she is the main character but it didnt make sense why out of everyone Julia specifically went to her for help. And I didnt see much chemistry between Eden?Veronica and her friend Dawn. But really other than that, I wasn't disappointed with the film and found it fascinating.Janelle Monae is incredible in the film. It probably won't happen but she would be completely deserving of an Oscar nom. Also, I absolutely loved the score. Especially in that intro scene, it really sucks you into this story and feels perfectly unsettling. I loved all the visual nods and references to other parts in the film.The film is definitely intense. And while yes, it is another slave movie to a degree, I felt like this at least tried to do something different with that genre.But overall, I liked it, and feel like is a worth a watch.",Antebellum
67,TuesdayThe17th,How many of you that liked this movie even know the lead characters name?,1,10 November 2020,"This was one of the movies who's release was hampered by the corona virus. Set to release in theaters some time in early 2020, this movie was actually released to VOD instead along with other theater titles. The trailer for this film was extremely ambiguous and did not give us much info. All we knew from the trailer was that the movie somehow tackles racism. Surprise surprise that Jordan Peele is attached to this film. Now, Peele is obviously sticking to racial matter in his material, forming a unique portfolio, but unfortunately this movie was quite bad. The plot on the sleeve for this movie claims to be about a successful writer who is enjoying a night on the town with her friends when she is thrust into having to face the past, present, and future. This couldn't be farther from the truth as the movie opens with pure confusion and wrings every last drop out of a terrible start to any movie. I am all for ambiguity and i dont need plots spoon fed, but this beginning was just god awful. I figured it was the typical 5 to 10 minute opening scene that was possibly showing a sequence that is to come later in the movie. After the beginning went from 10 minutes to over 40 minutes, I was sure I was watching the wrong movie based off the plot I had read earlier. Then, something changes.. The movie gets SORT OF good near the middle while we are treated to the current time frame and are introduced to a few new characters which is where the decent recovery of this film comes to an abrupt end. Gabby Sidibe is a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE actor people... She can't even say a sentence with out making it feel unnatural or awkward...like seriously, her dialogue just SUCKED. Even more than the rest of the films dialogue. She is so annoying and apparently she thinks she is cool. She speaks with breaks in her sentences making her sound nervous or immature....ugh I couldn't bear it. The third act of this movie is also terrible as i was expecting a totally different storyline to evolve. Sadly, it did not and its safe to say that I would have been a better choice to direct since I actually anticipated a clever and unique ending where the roles were opposite in the near future, showing that the race war had ended and whites were now slaves. NOPE , this movie ended up being SOOO generic and honestly, the whole ""past, present, and future"" thing doesn't even make sense. The ONLY time frame our main character, Veronica, deals with here is the present, as a dream doesn't count as the PAST...and hours later doesn't count as the future....like DUH... This duo of directors are awful and this movie is beyond bad. In the beginning it was hard to even know for sure who was the main character as many side characters got more screen time than our protagonist... Jordan Peele should broaden his horizons and not stick strictly to films that deal with race... Liiiike, we get it bro. Now get over it and move on.",Antebellum

The consequences of her escape attempt are brutally taken out against two others as the rest of the plantation looks on in submissive silence.Weeks later more slaves arrive and are given the rules by the brutal Overseer who demands silence and utter obedience at all times.The slaves are made to work the fields and serve the plantation including the women being assigned to whichever soldier desires them.Their plight grabs you from the start in its brutality as they have no rights, live in fear daily, and are subject to whatever whims those in charge desire and they are required to obey and suffer in silence.One night after the General falls asleep after having his way with her; Eden awakens to a different reality. One set in the modern day where she is a wife, mother, and very successful author and activist. The film follows her life in the modern world before springing the twist which makes doing an in-depth review difficult without spoiling things. While I was able to predict the twist coming; it was still effective and chilling in how it was carried out.The film does get a bit lax in the final act as it relies on too many Hollywood clichés which while highly entertaining for me undermined the messages of the film and the situation.Gerard Bush and Christopher Rend both wrote and directed the film and there are some powerful and highly gripping moments to the film but it grabs you from the start and is compelling and deeply disturbing.The cast is very strong and the film is unforgettable. My biggest issue with the film was the final act as I alluded to prior. The film tries to tie things up a bit too neatly yet fails to adequately explain key aspects of the story. The audience is given some information and forced to fill in the gaps for themselves which in many ways makes the film even more disturbing.In the time of deep division in our country it is very upsetting to see how little has changed for many who do not see equality and justice applied equally and still live day to day with fear and uncertainty.""Antebellum"" is the rare film that entertains, informs, and makes you think and will remain with you after the movie ends.",Antebellum

105,mr_sharma,"A passable twist on previously done, better plots",6,8 April 2021,"There are a number of things you need to have NOT seen to enjoy this.Firstly DO NOT SEE the trailer for this film. It gives away quite a bit of what is a reasonably good twist.And DO NOT SEE a certain M Night film because that is basically where the reasonably good twist comes from.Finally DO NOT be familiar with Margaret Atwood's
Work because that gives away what comes after the twist.It's presciently perfect to have this film be released in this day and age. Black Lives Matter is an issue worth highlighting. Janelle Monae is a prominent advocate (her song ""Whatchutalmbout"" - pardon the spelling) is excellent. She's a good actress.The issue is that even the though the sentiment is right, the execution of the idea is passable.Having used plot devices already seen elsewhere, what is left is the relationship between slaves and masters. What was explored in ""12 years a slave"" so well is sort of like a stereotypical version in this film. White characters are overwhelming in the ""nasty"" category. Bigots. Awful people. You can argue that that's exactly how black people have been portrayed for years. Yet, we live in 2021 and we are looking for nuanced characters. Where evil is not just acting evil but it's the little things.I get the sentiments, just don't feel it when the film finishes.If you compared it to ""Get out"" (equally as outlandish in it's ideas), that film works because of humour and regardless of colour, you fit into the shoes of the main character. Here, I get the female perspective is being explored but in such a heavy handed way that it gets lost in cliche.This is about film making and as such story telling and how you tell it is crucial.When compared to something like ""US"", it fails. US does a fantastic job of pushing the message. It's engaging, edge of the seat and the plot provides a satisfying punch.I get Antebellum and what it's trying to say, just wish it was something more than rehash of previously seen plots about a theme that's been dealt with better elsewhere.Watch it, stick with it and then move on.

Mining the cultural arena is what made ""Get Out"" so great.Anyway, this is a waste of talent and, sadly, opportunity to say something profound about ongoing problems today.

Without giving away any spoilers, this one has a rather large twist on the whole thing. There is a certain point in this movie that you might begin to recognize it as a horror film, but entirely in a psychological sense. I truly enjoyed it and definitely don't see why some people thought so poorly of it. The acting was great. The story was well done and suspenseful. A lot of the reviews here say that the movie was not well executed and needed to have a bit more of a background, but I thought it was just fine.

Then all the sudden we are in present time. With weird stuff happening. Then back into the past, but with cell phones. And then it all started to come together and make sense to me.
It's a thriller. I believe it had a great story. I couldn't easily spot stupid errors that were overlooked. You know, like tires squealing on dirt roads, 4 stroke motorcycles sounding like 2 strokes. No 6 shooters shooting 10 shots. When being shot at, hearing the bang BEFORE you hear the bullet whizz past you (no one ever gets that right, apparently they never been shot at) Not that this movie had motorcycles or other thing listed above, just an example of common mistakes that degrade a movie. that says to me that they slapped it together and pushed it out the door, didn't bother to watch it themselves. Like proof read. (Proof watch) But not this movie. I didn't see obvious mistakes.

120,dashtag1234,Ridiculous and Stupid,3,26 January 2021,"This movie starts out interesting, with a story set on a plantation. It looks like a slave movie, with horrifying abuse and events that no one wants to see again. You think ""well, we've seen a million slave movies so maybe this is a bit redundant"" but at least it's somewhat interesting? However, even in the beginning 40 minutes there's still barely any plot or character, or dialogue, or empathy, or anything that looks like it will keep the story going.Suddenly we're in present day with annoying characters, bad acting and chunky dialogue. There is obvious racism that doesn't try to be subtle at all, as well as the whole assuming every white person is probably racist. Also, there's this dinner party where they don't show anyone's face besides the 3 at dinner...like, what's the point of that? Characters don't come back and this feels like it should have been the beginning of the movie. And then we're back to the slave plantation where we see ridiculous BS again. The movie ends with such a cringey scene you can't even watch it without laughing.The whole plot of this movie is pretty stupid. Like, a plantation in the 21st century, with racists kidnapping people and making them slaves...? How has no one noticed this or went looking for these people? And how has no one come across the plantation? All the shots with the plantation and the cell phones look incredibly stupid. It just goes way over the top, it's cringey and stupid, and overall just dumb. They flip the whole story around for no reason, it would have been a bit better if maybe you actually told this story in a linear way?The directors are just trying to be different.

The film just didn't make much sense up to that point.Was there a horror, yes, in the fact that these people were really-enacting aspects of history and kidnapping black men and women to be their ""slaves"" was despicable and horrific. The fact that these were educated, professionals that were made to be nothing more than ""cotton pickers"", who were demeaned, marginalized, beat, murdered and belittled was a bit more than I bargained for with this movie.",Antebellum
123,sherylchilders82,"Great idea, worth the watch",7,22 March 2021,"First of all, I agree with most reviewers that this film could have been better. But, there was an effort I think to recreate the black horror genre, that Get Out started. So, if you see this as a continuation of that, it has done what it set out to do.As far as the first third of the movie, set on what we are to believe is a plantation in Civil War era, the mystery and horror is properly set. I had read the synopsis before watching, so I knew she was supposedly a writer somehow transported back in time (or so I thought). The imagery and brutality is a bit over the top, but conveying it this way was purposeful. In a short act, we are flung into the cruel reality of being an owned person and the degradation of it.Then, during the second third, we are jolted awake into the present, with the past symbolically still with us. I appreciated this theme of how this brutal past is still carried with us, and I think it is true. Trauma is passed through generations. Actually, I thought that was the greatest message in the movie. We see the writer's true identity now. The dialogue is sometimes fake and simplistic, like the TV interview. I would say that it's probably dumbed down on purpose, because this is clearly a horror movie, not deep social commentary. I think it's a little annoying that anything about slavery or racism has to be (a deep commentary, that is). There were some pretty good parts here with Gabourey Sidibe and Jena Malone, who are hilarious and terrifying, respectively. There are some funny bits all throughout the movie, little looks or one-liners that make it great. The suspense and mystery also builds with the creepy girl, and how they don't show many of the weird characters faces.The last third is the all out horror act, with nail-biting suspense, tragedy, and sick revenge. It is true to the genre, which isn't supposed to make you feel good or give you any answers. We immediately know ""the twist"", as other reviewers have said, which doesn't turn out to be that mysterious at all. But, it felt a little too dumbed down here. After the guy is on the cell phone, even the one jet overhead feels like overkill. We just saw her get taken in the present. Unless we saw her go through a magic time portal like Alice in Wonderland, the phone is enough to let us know we're in and always have been in the present.I like that Veronica is ruthless - it rings true with the horror genre, where the main character has been so traumatized and corrupted by the many brutal injustices throughout, she essentially loses it with rage. It creates the shock factor necessary for any good scary flick. This idea that pure animalistic instincts lie within us all, waiting for the right circumstances. This is actually a very gothic theme. I think people have really underrated this film, failing to link the many aspects and motives of the writers. But, I can't quite give it a top score, because I still felt like there wasn't quite enough closure or driving of the point home in the end. There was the great scene with her busting out through the war reenactment, looking crazy in slow motion, then like two shots of the FBI. It just felt like it ended too abruptly with that weird jet, again, like we still didn't get that it was present day. Of course, the lack of closure could also be on purpose, because there is a lot to unravel after Veronica's violent escape.",Antebellum

I didn't read what this movie was about before watching it, so not too much was given away from just the trailer. I think its also important to take note of current day message in this movie. As someone who has visited this particular plantation in New Orleans last year (when they were filming this, funnily enough), its easy to see the beauty of the land, and the set of which many movies were filmed.

She, as well as everyone else, does a great job acting and the visuals are also done extremely well. The twist was not hard to figure out, and I'm not quite sure why is labeled a horror movie, rather a psychological thriller. Other than that, the movie was great, and was well worth watching. I normally would rate it an 8, because it's not a horror & have a certain rating scale of movies. However, I rated this a 10 because of the low ratings, because like I said, if a white woman was in the leading role, it wasn't categorized as a horror, I am positive that there would be much higher ratings and better reviews. I even read in one review, the white woman, Jenna Malone, should receive an oscar? I'm sorry, what? Yeah, she's a good actress, I don't take that away from her, but um.......no. Maybe they meant the lead actress, because Jenalle Monae' and Jenna Malone sound alike, and they got it backwards, if so, my mistake, but if not well, like I said..... The movie was very good but not a horror movie, it's definitely a psychological thriller. I recommend watching it, no matter which it is. Yes, there is a message being sent within this movie, but that's the case in many movies. It's not as one reviewer said, ""Black is power, White is bad."" __eye roll___ If you're racist in any manner, you shouldn't watch it, because your not gonna like anything that shows any black person in it unless they are slaves or killed, smh.....Otherwise, if you are not racist and like thrillers, you will like this movie. You'd probably like it either way, whether you like thrillers or not, so maybe try it out......",Antebellum
137,coolliegal4,Bored out if my mind,4,31 January 2021,I was looking through my phone for entertainment during the movie. Writing had little to no creativity. The acting was off for about half of the cast and the movie just needed more depth. It's also not as scary as the trailer makes it seem.

I understand the point the movie is making and credit to them for trying to tell it in a different way but there is no twist here. Fifteen minutes in I guessed the scenario she was in and at the end of the film you're just left thinking 'that's ridiculous it could never happen' which then downplays the whole narrative a bit. 'The Village' by Shyamalan is way better and more believable in actual fact. I think once more people have seen this film I can see it landing a rating of 3.5 and an entrant onto the worst movies of 2020 list, which is a shame because there are some ok performances but the plot is dissatisfying and ludicrous really.

I wondered why such a successful author would use a ride share service instead of a bonded, licensed limo service or at least something with security. This film is fairly interesting and a unique story, but a bit of a let-down as a horror-thriller. I kept wondering if Jordan Peele could have improved it. As a native of Louisiana, it sickened me to have our people portrayed in such a disgusting, insane manner, but i realize it's ultimately supposed to be entertainment. I have no doubt that such whacked-out people exist, but expecting these fools to execute such a complicated plan is rather hopeful! The music was relatable to the mood, but too loud and jarring in some places. Overall, it's a decent movie to watch to pass the time if not taken too seriously.",Antebellum

147,cockadoody73,Ignore the bad reviews.,7,27 September 2020,"I started this expecting a horror movie. This is a different type of horror altogether.It starts with a fantastic sweeping shot through a Southern plantation. We see slaves, Confederate soldiers and cotton fields. We see two slaves, a man and a woman, being restrained by soldiers. The man is taken down, the woman runs and is lassoed, dragged and shot.
It's clear within the first 20 minutes that our heroine - Eden/Veronica - is living on a brutal plantation. The depiction of outright cruelty and degradation isn't nice to watch, but being confronted with the truth about slavery isn't and shouldn't be comfortable. Talking is forbidden, escape attempts are punished with branding, beatings or death. The daily routine is harsh and the soldiers rape the slave women whenever they feel like it. Eden is raped regularly by a General known as 'Him'. She falls asleep after another rape.
When she awakes we see her in her upmarket apartment, with her husband and daughter. She is a successful writer. She flies off to a different city to give a talk to an eager audience.
Sound confusing? Well it is.As time progresses we start to see clues, we see familiar faces from the plantation in the city. Then there's a slow realisation what has actually happened.
It's a good film, I much prefer this to Us or Get Out. But there's no denying that it bears more than a passing resemblance to The Village.
The acting is outstanding, especially from the always excellent Janelle Monáe.
Some of the middle part of the movie slows the pace and could probably have been dumped and it still would have made sense.
I'm a fan of Gabourey Sidibe, but her character in this movie is awful. She's rude and condescending to an admirer, overbearing in her desire for attention, obnoxious and under the impression that she is irresistible to all who lay eyes on her. The fact that she gropes the Uber driver and thinks it's hilarious when he flinches is awful, a man doing the same to a woman would quite rightly be accused of sexual harassment, but as it's a woman doing wit we are expected to find it funny. I didn't.So don't believe the 1 and 2 star reviews, watch it for yourself and draw your own conclusions.
And the reviews stating the low ratings come from 'a certain section of society' or that you can't get the message unless your are 'marginalised' or a poc simply stand to inflame racial tension, not to help resolve it.

149,Highcritic-95845,Do not watch the trailer before you watch the movie!,8,23 March 2021,"I did not watched the trailer and I am glad I didn't. Had so much emotions while watching this. The start of the movie was quite disturbing when they showed about Black Slavery during the American Civil War era. Slowly you'll come to think that : ok, this movie isn't horror after all.
Suddenly, the lead actress woke up on her comfy bed in present day and you started to wonder: what's going on? is this movie about time-travelling? This continues with the familiar antagonist faces appearing in present day. The creepy part kicks in when the little girl (antagonist's daughter in 1800s dress) appeared inside the hotel elevator together with the lead actress and you'll think: is this little girl a ghost? The movie keeps you in suspense when lead actress got abducted until it brought us back to the Civil War era again.

Art direction and cinematography were great. The first sequence shows right away this is going to be no cheap horror flick. Well executed, well written, good twist. And as a a thought provoking piece, it hits the spot. It even got the right winged conservative oppressors thinking. And they all came here to pour their hate in form of bad reviews. This is the only explanation for this movie's low rating.I do agree with the reviewers that criticized the slow motion ending though. It felt kinda lazy. Visually, I suppose there were better ways to portray Veronica's escape. Also, Jena Malone's performance was hammy, but since she was the villainess, the affected overacting just made her more unlikeble, which was the whole point. But these were the only reasons I didn't give this movie a higher rating. Other than that, I thought it was very enjoyable and timely.",Antebellum

154,gatheringsnow,"Past, Present, and Future Tense all Interwoven",8,23 September 2020,"As the quote from William Faulkner in the beginning states, the past isn't even past. Making sure to keep that in mind as the film began in an attempt to figure out what was going on before the big reveal is fully explained to the audience, I'll be completely honest and say that even when a minor reveal happened I still didn't entirely get what was happening. Starring Janelle Monae as Veronica as well as ""Eden"", Kiersey Clemons as Julia, Gabourey Sidibe as Dawn, Eric Lange as the General or ""Him"", Jack Huston as Captain Jasper, and Jena Malone as Elizabeth, Antebellum is a very polarizing film for a lot of people as a lot of people are either trashing this film for having what they view as a misleading trailer, an attempt to glorify slavery or at least the Antebellum South, or just another heavy-handed slave movie invoking white guilt ridden audiences and showing how evil it was and how they are complicit in the modern day repercussions through their obliviousness to their ""white privilege"". However I firmly believe that it is none of those things.Evoking imagery from other more famous horror, thriller, or slavery movies such as The Shining, The Village, 12 years a slave, and perhaps most notably and justifiably, the Jordan Peele 2017 black social thriller ""Get Out"" through which numerous comparisons have already been made, ""Antebellum"" has shades of all of those films but also much more to bring to the table. Following the main character, a successful, a renowned sociologist, author, and public speaker who also happens to be a black woman, something which in and of itself, some certain individuals find threatening enough to their pre-conceived notions of order in American society.In addition to her role as Veronica she also plays Dawn, a slave woman living on a plantation in the Antebellum South in what appears to be the midst of the Civil War. Alongside fellow slaves Eli (Tongayi Chirisa) and pregnant Julia (Kiersey Clemons) all of whom seem to strangely unaccustomed to life on a slave plantation, the general confusion, chaos, and seeming anachronistic elements and dialogue thrown in to the mix seem to hint that something far more inexplicable and horrific is going on, even in the context of an already sinister situation, as certain characters seem to be present in BOTH settings, perhaps hinting that there is time travel or something supernatural going on. The cinematography and score are incredibly evocative and beautiful to look at, in addition to the costume design which accurately portrays the fairly elegant if not over the top clothing the slave owners and their families wore during the time period with all of the fancy lace and crinoline you would expect giving them all an air of false affability, particularly Elizabeth played with cold conviction by Jena Malone, her character intentionally evoking Scarlett O'Hara from Gone with the Wind, in spite of the various horrors being inflicted on the enslaved men and women by the Confederate soldiers on the plantation. They are under the brutal command of the General and Captain Jasper, a cruel and sadistic overseer who seems to take great pleasure in making sure all of the slaves are as miserable as humanly possible while working in the fields.While some scenes are very difficult to watch, despite the horrific events which unfold over the nearly two hour running time, the film itself is rarely all that frightening in regards to building tension and atmosphere and could be likened to more as a drama or thriller despite being marketed as a horror. In both time periods the emphasis on the interwoven nature of the past and present is constantly shown, often in very unpleasant scenarios whether it be Veronica's friend Dawn berating a waitress about attempting to seat her and her party of three in a poorly lit corner of a fancy restaurant or a white hotel receptionist giving Veronica an unnecessarily rude and flippant attitude when she attempts to book a room in an upscale hotel, the concept of microaggressions comes to mind, as well as the false idea of the notion that we are living in a post racial society.As evidence has shown from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the BLM protests, are all of the evidence society at large needs to know that while progress definitely has been made since the Civil Rights era, we are still far from a truly post racial America, a truth this film hits home far more bluntly than many people would like it seems, while there are of course some flaws to be found such as ""preachy"" dialogue and writing which can also be described as heavy-handed or pretentious to many viewers I think that overall this film's strengths vastly outweighs it's weaknesses, and it's also definitely a film which needs to be watched more than once, much like the movie Get Out, from both the perspective of a first viewer trying to figure out just what the hell is going on, and a second time viewer spotting vital clues and imagery that they might have missed or ignored the first time around.

Janelle does a credible job as the lead, however, I don't think she had the acting skills ti carry the picture. Probably would have been better with a higher quality actor to really bring out the true irony of what is happening. There are some obvious editing flaws in a couple of plot areas that are never explained, but eliminated perhaps to cut length. I also believe that some characters should have been exoanded rather than focus on Janelle who still has under-developed acting chops. Overall, this is a good movie and worth seeing.

There are quite a few scenes that wear far too many hats, and some eye rolling moments, but doesn't really take away from what the movie is about. Many reviewers here seem to be confused to what horror is; the atrocities of our societies intensified 3 fold. Revealing to its audience like a bell ring... I'd imagine most of the detractors people are white, and/or never really experience or had to sympathize for people that have it harder than they do. So there reviews seem a bit biased.

Instead of presenting us with interesting and complex characters, good story and development the movie just tries to compensate the black people somewhat by providing them some sort of revenge.

Unsuccessfully. As if they couldn't believe themselves in the roles they had to play.Back to the script. Oh my God. Every thing in it seems unfinished. The beginning looked pretty okay. A lil slow but pretty good. And the more time goes by, the more the common thread running through the storyline erodes away.

After an umpteenth ""come on, not like this !"" and Janelle Monae riding a horse in the way of William Wallace, she will not save Parabellum from a disaster you have seen coming for a long long time. More than 1 hour is like eternity there. The struggle against racism deserves much more than a parody of a complicated script made of sham appearances. In this context, the aestethics of the film appear to be both disruptive and meaningless. Last but not least, they sell the film like an horror movie. Be ready to be also disappointed about this.

177,denise-99445,A True-to-Life Horror Movie,8,18 September 2020,"This movie is timely based on today's current political, racial and social environment. Some reviewers are carping on the fact it is not a true HORROR movie. Listen up, for Black Americans it's the horror we live with daily. The fact that we can be harassed, brutalized, or worse, murdered for driving, barbecuing in a park, jogging, bird watching, eating ice cream or sleeping in our own damn homes- you name it, simply for the color of our skin. We live with the fear that our hard won freedoms can be snatched from us any day. Some angry whites counter the movie is stereotypical and presents them in a bad light. Guess what? History has presented Blacks in a bad light for years! I'm sure this portrayal is closer to fact than the inhumane images Blacks have had to deal with for generations. If you like movies that are timely, well acted, will make you think, and have plot twists, this movie's for you.",Antebellum

In fact watching the trailer gives you the complete wrong idea and that is by design. That being said I really enjoyed this film. At first I wondered why the relatively low score on imdb but it totally makes sense now. There is a certain percentage of people who will no doubt be rubbed the wrong way by a movie where white people are the villains. They tend to be the same people that feel attacked when a horror movie has a point to make or underlying messages. I think this is an important movie and should be watched my a lot more people.,Antebellum

Movies about human suffering are important. They are lessons to all of us. Movies that go on and on and on, keep showing never ending stream of abuse and humiliation and suffering, that gets not only unpleasant but it also gets boring in a hurry. That's how I felt about Antebellum. I got bored very quickly, and when I learned what that place really was I began to press skip forward button on my remote. It was pretty obvious what was going to happen next. Bad guys were all going to die a horrible death and the good guy is going to win.If it weren't for some of this movie's better moments I would have just turned it off and gone back to watching French Open.What better moments? There were two of them. The opening scene was really good. Also, I liked the main character. She was really good.

189,earthboli,"Decently Suspenseful & Good Message, but has Major Issues",6,19 September 2020,"I was really looking forward to this movie after I saw the trailer last year. I watched it, and...well. Hmm. What makes it particularly hard to review this movie is being able to critique without spoiling anything, but I'll do my best.This is a movie in 3 acts, almost like a play. We start with a Black woman who is enslaved and tortured on a Civil War-era plantation. Everyone is brutalized, and it is horrific there. We follow her story. In act two we see a powerful, accomplished Black woman traveling to speak at a conference and we get to know her life. And act three reveals all. Unfortunately, the big reveal comes at the very beginning of the 3rd act, 30 minutes before the ending when you realize the twist, so that the very end isn't a true reveal because you probably guessed it by now because what other possible conclusion can you make once your know the twist?This movie tries REALLY hard to show how horrific white supremacy and racism are (as they are), but gets super heavy-handed and over-the-top with symbolism, particularly in the third act. It beats you over the head with symbolism, in fact. That said, it is very suspenseful and a nail-biter because you don't know what will happen to the main characters in the film, and you feel empathy for them. The cinematography is good, the music also really solid and creates the right ambiance. The script is not great--I don't know a lot of folks who actually talk this way to their friends and seemed a bit cheesy in the 2nd act, so I think they could've done a lot better there. They also made Gabourey Sidibe's character inappropriately aggressive and cringey in certain parts--you'll understand if you watch.The visuals are flashy, and the overall message is good, but the execution felt kind of shallow and half-baked in some ways. I felt like they took an interesting premise, spent a lot of money on actors and cinematographers, but sorta dropped the ball on the writing in parts, particularly given the ending, which could have been much better and more interesting had they made different creative choices. The whole movie, I thought something far more creative as a possibility was happening in the film as I was guessing, and was ultimately disappointed that it wasn't as creative as I thought it was.That said, you might feel like it's still worth watching for the overall message and the suspense. At its heart, it's a decent thriller/suspense film, but promised more than it delivered in terms of writing and creativity. If you want another Get Out, you'll be sorely disappointed. Temper your expectationsand it will be decent for what it is--a suspense film with a relevant message.As a side note, my spouse figured out the twist from the start of the film and never felt like there were any real unknowns in the film, whereas I did not. The trailer definitely gives more away than it should--I would suggest not watching it at all and going in with an open mind.",Antebellum

Anyway, it's still a bad movie however you want to label it. I'm not getting into the political babble or shaming.

192,glennmeerten06,"Antebellum, a picture stifled by a 1000 words",7,15 September 2020,"Antebellum tells the remarkable story of Eden, a slave on a plantation somewhere in America. It also chronicles events in the life of a successful modern-day author called Veronica. As the film progresses, the connection between these two storylines becomes clear, and that's about all I can say about the plot.THE POSITIVESOne of the biggest strengths of the flick, is a masterful hand behind the camera. Gorgeous cinematography, guided by thoughtful direction, bring as much emotional impact to the film as the stellar performances do. The structural editing on display here, is a showcase of the profound understanding the filmmakers have of the narrative. The film is filled to the brim with subtle visual setups that have satisfying pay-offs at the end. The opening scene is one of the most gripping collection of images, I've seen all year. It was an absolute treat to discover that the final sequence reaches the same impactfull heights but with a very different connotation. I can't stress enough how the technical aspects of Antebellum are Oscarworthy. cinematography, lighting, production design and costume design are in a league of their own. They all work together to truly make the performances shine.
THE NEGATIVESUnfortunately, the film undoes a lot of the greatness within itself, as the flick goes along. The underlying message is anything but underlying. It rather weighs down heavily on the audience and is often times spelled out to the letter. All of the striking, brutal imagery, is somehow negated by heavy-handed pandering to an agenda, I don't even disagree with. An almost comedic over the top female villain who is in sharp contrast with some bold, grounded performances by other antagonists, offers nothing more than frustration. I truly want to love this film more than it allows me to.THE VERDICTAntebellum is composed out of a collection of striking images that showcase craftsmanship in front and behind the camera. Its brutal, grounded and thoughtful imagery is undermined however, by a painfully, spelled out message that comes across as pandering more often than not.",Antebellum

I think some have become immune to its impact this is why for many it continues to perpetuate through generations and is such a challenge to eradicate.

Almost a Masterpiece,8,22 October 2020,"This racially charged near-masterpiece isn't your typical horror movie but instead concerns the horror of slavery, which could be considered one of the worst horrors imaginable. The directing & cinematography is astonishing in places. The acting, for the most part, of a notably high standard with a stunningly attractive leading lady getting most of our attention. I'll resist going into details about the story for fear of ruining it but I'll say that the final scenes explain things and tie everything together well. You literally get that ""ohhh, now i get it!"" moment in the last few shots with a final reveal.

This film is not a horror movie at all (lucky for me) and only remotely classifies as a thriller. The topic certainly is scary a hell but the execution just fails to see it through. The Whole thing doesn't fulfill it's potential. The story set-up is unlogical and makes it hard to get a feeling of identification with the main character. Other characters aren't explained (and often then die) leaving you feeling like: huh? Who was this character?All in all: great concept but if you want to watch a horror movie this one will leave you very dissatisfied and if you want to watch a very grisly but powerful movie about the horrors of slavery I would recommend '12 years a slave' or 'Jango Unchained'.,Antebellum

You mean we didn't get magically transported back into Civil War times, like the trailer would have us to believe?

However, it still does not come quickly. In fact, it gets more gruesome before it gets even the slightest bit better, and then, at 1:16:04, the protagonist Veronica/Eden gets her magical sign to make the big move.

It didn't do much for the overall story, and was pretty confusing at times. Had they started the movie where the actual story started, I think I would have gotten more into it and felt more suspense throughout the whole thing rather than just at the end.

I might have preferred a bit more subtle acting at times, but it was still very engaging and I could heavily empathize at moments. The camera work and pacing is very smooth. It reminded me of 12 years of slave in some scenes, but it turns quite unique and symbolic later and some interesting novel genre mixing.
The story itself is quite skewed to a left leaning perspective, which is totally fine, but it would be nice to show some self referencing irony or some more nuanced perspective, because it felt a bit ideological limited in content. It should be fine to have a film with a hard perspective, but I think what is more needed today is to bring nuance to the dialog to open up the polarised views we have today.

I found Antebellum made me uncomfortable to watch it, much like the pilot of Lovecraft country did not because it was gory. But because it made me realize how absolutely horrible and awful it was back then. The movie is about the evil that upright citizens are capable of against their fellow citizens, against the backdrop of the south shall rise again!

I did, however, enjoy the scene where the ""gentlemen"" are locked inside the ""steam Room"". I also enjoyed the scene where the fair lady of the plantation comes to a complete and sudden stop near the end of the movie. The horror I felt in this movie was unprecedented to me.

Any of these would've worked better than what they came up with.

First, although the concept is horrifying, it's not a horror but more of a suspense. Second, the cinematography is amazing. Third, the concept is very timely considering the climate in our country.It's also something that me and my black friends discuss all the time...this thought of how some white people are living in the past and we're living in the present with an eye on the future.

And it is depicted in a way, which gives one a kind of new perspective on racism and showed how infinitely primitive and stupid it is.But of course it's rating is below 6 (IMDB) because it is about black people.

Acting/drama itself has many political roots (think Bertolt Brecht, Shakespeare, even ancient Greek plays) and is designed to engage an audience critically. However, the messy plot is a more than valid reason for a negative review, as is the lack of decent characterisation. It is not what I expected, having been described as a horror, and as others have mentioned, 'Get Out' is a much better movie if that is what you are looking for.
Despite what some may say, I thought the acting was good, and the cinematography was also adept at depicting the American south and brutal conditions of slavery. Janelle Monáe brought her character and the horrors of the life of an enslaved individual to the screen, but I felt the script let her down and did not build the required sympathy between her and the audience.

It's definitely not a horror movie but mostly a mystery thriller.For those who can't relate to the main characters, maybe they are still in denial about the systemic racism still existing in the US today and don't want to admit to it or face it's ugly face. Few countries are as obsessed with re-enacting past wars, especially civil wars as the US and it seems very odd the side that lost still tries to frequently glorify its past. I thought the movie did a decent job poking at the white-washing of a shameful part of US history.So aside from those still in denial of real US history, I do think the film made some connections to the audience.

It deals with slavery and racism, sure. But the story it's telling, at its core, is a great one. Shame on those who hate on this film as part of their crusade against progressive thinking. But kudos to the studio that produced it.The movie holds up from beginning to end, but unfortunately won't get its due respect, as it is now simply a casualty of the division this country is experiencing, and a disdain for anything that challenges the status quo in America.

Second of all, Janelle Monáe as a lead also made her excel in many ways possible as she delivered a great performance that really made me feel connected to her character as a whole (I also liked the rest of the cast as well). And last (but not least), can we just praise the marketing skills that they did to promote this film? The ambiguity of the trailers and posters I thought were spectacular and I thoroughly enjoyed how they advertised this film in such mysterious ways.Unfortunately though, the film itself isn't particularly a masterpiece - it's flawed. The plot had several ways to potentially uplift itself to make such an interesting and unique plot that could've went differently from the outcome that we've got. However, I felt as if this was more so a style over substance flick than something that equally balanced the two together (which with a narrative that this film was going for, would've made it much more better if it had actually went into deeper depths of narrative exploration along with it's artful features). See, when you make a film that tries to make a point, you also have to dig deeper into the narrative that allows it's point to truly shine - however it's as if this film didn't bother to do that for the majority of the time. And the pivotal revelation of the film could've been executed much more better if it was shown at a later time in the film rather than it being shown too early (and even with that I'm not really a fan of the reveal).I liked the score though, especially the soundtrack that played at the opening scene of the movie (which the scene and the score in itself were amazing).

The dialogue also slips in a line clearly meant to throw the viewer off from guessing the twist, and it succeeded in doing so--to the point where Garrett and I were questioning which setting was real and which wasn't. It isn't until roughly the midway point when the pieces starting falling in place and the twist was revealed, leaving both Garrett and me satisfied. The casting as well as the acting were top-notch, and I was especially impressed with Janelle Monáe's performance. The soundtrack is elegant, and, when paired with the cinematography, makes Antebellum aesthetically pleasing from start to finish. The film has been heavily criticized for its portrayal of racism, but it serves to indicate--albeit extremely--how racism is still a prevailing issue in society today. An original concept for a film that kept us on the edge of our seats with surprisingly tense moments and well-written characters. A must-watch of 2020.",Antebellum
296,bijoubrown,Reckoning with the Past (or Present),8,19 September 2020,"This movie is about the dark side of Civil War reenactments. It's about how some people take the act too far and want to bring it to life. This movie is about how large portions of America still celebrate the times before the civil war and the Confederacy, i.e. antebellum. The main character in this movie is an author, and by the end of her perils she will have another best-selling novel on her battered hands. This movie would make for a great book. The movie reminded me of Get Out or Cabin In The Woods, *bleep* happening to people in the most outrageously unexpected (or maybe expected) ways. When I was halfway through the movie I was critical of the layout, but by the end I loved it. The reason for this was foreshadowing: there's a lot of it. A few moments of foreshadowing: firstly, the burning of cotton in front of the slaves who had picked it--why burn cotton?!? (by the end that question will be answered); secondly, the very large painting in Veronica's home of a regal woman next to a horse in a long red getup--later on in the movie we see a different woman, maybe not so regal, wearing a long red getup riding a horse; thirdly, yoga. This movie recognizes beauty in subtleties.
The movie kept me hooked as I wondered about the next twist or plot point. A couple of significant thematic elements I noticed were butterflies, airplanes, and silence; although these were very explicit elements. Airplanes as a reminder of or gateway to home, technology? Butterflies represent necessary metamorphosis or symmetry? Silence is used as a mechanism for oppression.
The last 30 minutes of the film, to me, were dazzling. In saying that, I have to give credit to the first hour and fifteen minutes for establishing an august foundation to a satisfying crescendo of events at the end.
I loved that there were clear good and bad proponents. The bad were desperate to live in the past and snuff out agents of progress (the good). At one point, an antagonistic imposter, shrouded in a confederate flag prophesizes something he thinks is profound, to which the protagonist t'sks, akin to a harrumph, as if to show Veronica is obviously indignant at this point in the movie. This highlights the absurdity boring the chasm that exists between good and bad, or right and wrong.
The cinematography was lovely. Half of the movie seemed as if you are viewing it through a mirky bottle of Fuji water.
The score was awesome and was a subtle fear-inducing constituent of the film. There were inherently horrific parts to the film, but I wouldn't call it a horror, I'd call it a dark mystery thriller.",Antebellum

Unfortunately, I cannot critique this unique and intriguing plot without spoiling it. However, I will say it is an insightful metaphor representing the deeply entrenched collective psychological damage done to Black Americans from centuries of enslavement and tyranny. All the actors performed exceptionally, with Monáe's being of Academy Award caliber. The movie was gripping, eye-opening, and entertaining.

It was like reading a poorly written high school history book, even if the subject is interesting the writing makes it a chore to read.The story was predictable, start to end with no surprises or twists.The acting was well done, though there was little in the way of character development.

304,hongsc,What in the World Did I Watch?!,1,20 September 2020,"I had high hopes for this movie. Released during a pandemic, numerous protests, social unrest, and seeing meaningful changes happening. The timing of Antebellum was almost ""perfect."" Or so I thought. This movie is offensive in a way that undermines everything good that has happened from the protests. This movie is so bad and perplexing especially coming from the producers of Us and Get Out. Rest assured Jordan Peele had nothing to do with this horrendous movie.At first watching this movie was a bit uncomfortable. It takes place just before the Civil War hence the name Antebellum. The Confederate soldiers were in full force. In the opening scene black slaves tried to escape and they were caught and punished. One female slave was dragged by a noose then shot. The main lead or Eden is taken to her cabin and for her punishment she is branded. She's repeated rape as well. The female slave that was killed was burned and her ashes remained in an outhouse. More slaves are brought in because hey, they keep killing the ones they have already. Eden falls asleep and awakes in modern times. Her smartphone goes off. She has a family; a loving husband and daughter. She's on TV as well having a discussion about white oppression with a man that looks eerily similar to Joe Biden. I guess they couldn't afford Alec Baldwin to play Trump in the movie. All is well or is it? I think okay there are alternate timelines or a dual reality. No, the twist makes Dumb and Dumber an Oscar worthy movie. It's that bad. There is no alternative timeline or multi-verse. The answer is much, much simpler or dumber. It's all the same timeline. You see the white daughter, mother, father, plantation owner all in modern times. You almost get the Redrum scene or feel with the little girl. You see the wokeness with the Jefferson suite, the scarlet red lipstick, plantation owner/name initials on her jewelry, the use of Eden or paradise, and Veronica talking about the ""angry black woman""; and breaking the chains of oppression by white society, using buzz words like liberation over assimilation. She's, also, selling her book, which is commercializing her plight. You get Veronica or Eden's friend say she doesn't spend enough time on herself or she's too hard on herself, while she's doing hot yoga or after a workout. She has a friend that's ""Precious"", the other is a token white friend; of course, then there's the repetition that black slaves must stay silent, say your name over and over again to Eden ( I don't know if that's referencing Roots or Destiny's Child), and Veronica wearing Ivy Park. She's Gen Z woke. One has to wonder if this movie was a made during the pandemic that the Becky reference would have changed to Karen. Then the twist happens and the ""Confederates"" kidnap Eden/Veronica. She awakes in her cabin getting raped again. But somehow a smartphone is present. Fast forward, Eden/Veronica kills the man that constantly raped her and locked the three other white men in the outhouse. She burns the men alive in the same place as the female slave. It's payback. Then she carries her ax and it sort of reminds me of Pocahontas and she's riding a horse through a Civil War reenactment in slow-motion. No, I can't make this stuff up. Then you see a large sign that gets bulldozed at the end the movie with ""Civil War Reenactment"" So you can sum up this movie as a bunch of hardcore Confederate reenactors go full throttle and do their method acting on educated African American white collar employees. The only thing missing was the burning of the Confederate flag.",Antebellum

Trust me, keep watching and in the third act you are going to say OMG. It's a really great plot twist. It's difficult to stay watching till you understand the story but for me is worth it. Just try to pay attention to every small detail and the twist is going to hit you hard like it did to me.
It's really beautifully filmed and has some awesome shots, but the performances has it ups and downs. Sometimes they are really good but others are over the top. This last happens especially in the second act where the most boring and really poor written and acted scenes take place. Not even Janelle Monáe that carries the whole story on her back can escape the lame second act.
Some may say it's a story that falls into common african american culture topics. To be honest, they are right. But trust me, I don't recall a story that uses them to tell this type of tale, and it's a really great tale.

Take it on face level or try and look for the.intricacies between the margins between the lines. It will operate on both levels. It's Not a horror film unless you define 'Horror' as an experience that horrifies you. So if you place yourself into this film that might qualify. But by that definition so would any movie that allows you to identify with the victim. I would classify Antebellum more of a 'Thriller'. It plucks out pieces of modern acceptance and re-examines the backstory of our complacency. It also works as an edge-of-your-seat flick. Both will make you a little uncomfortable. The cinematic plot twists are merely a vehicle. Get in between the obvious and you will see something quite remarkable. ...Or you might just see a scary movie.,Antebellum

It presents itself as a drama or horror or thriller at different times. The movie would benefit from adding depth to its characters, specifically the villains. Why should you watch it?

It's not quite the masterpiece of 'Us' or 'Get out' and the time warp could have done with a lot more clarity, but as of the time of writing this it has a 5.5 review which is ridiculously low. I can't help thinking it's been downvoted because of political reasons. Now, back to the time warp... if David Lynch can flip and divert an entire films narrative just 'because' and create an abstractive piece of cinema, then why can't this film? If Quentin Taranto can make film finales fuelled on justice and revenge then why can't this film? Perhaps it's simply because the setting is on a slave plantation which makes folk uncomfortable?

It's a mix between the village and 12 years a slave, both films are far superior and if you haven't seen them then watch thise instead of this.Maybe because I have watched the film the village I figured it out pretty early on which left me just waiting for something to happen. It dragged on in parts - lots of really unnecessary parts in it, like the meal out with her friends, totally pointless and the actress from precious (which I liked) was really annoying and rude for absolutely no reason to a man that had an interest in her (very weird part of the film).

But...oit of boredom.. I watched it.. . The first segment was mildly irritating but I wasn't expecting the 2nd one and that caught my attention. A number of possibilities ran through my head and they seemed to be confirmed with script.
The 3rd segment really caught me.. I didn't see it coming at all.
I've watched the movie twice. The first segment, is now much more interesting, seeing these people for who they are.

366,thomasellieann,An Entertaining Mess,7,3 February 2021,"I can see why this movie has such mixed reviews. It is ambitious. It has a lot of ideas that do not come together as well as they should have. Having said that, I thought it was generally entertaining. Janelle Monae made for a solid lead and the supporting cast was good as well.It's a great looking movie with really good cinematography and it starts out very well as a period piece. However, the movie eventually changes its setting into the modern time which I felt was the weakest part of the movie despite Gabourey Sidibe being a very entertaining, funny, and charismatic character. I felt that a lot of scenes set during the modern time dragged out longer than they needed to. While I can't explain without spoiling, the foreshadowing felt very sloppy to me.I am not one to criticize movies for being unrealistic but it was actually hard for me to suspended my disbelief regarding the plot twist. It was ridiculously dumb, especially the way it played out in the last 3 minutes or so. However, I thought the climax in the last 20 minutes was really entertaining. Yes, it was corny and over the top but it was tense and exciting. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The final chase and fight reminded me of a fun good old fashioned western.This is a very divisive movie and while it doesn't reach its full potential, it still very much entertains despite its numerous flaws.",Antebellum

The ending works very well in making you reexamine what you've seen and look at it in a different light. It makes earlier scenes work a lot better when you know the full story. This is the main reason for the higher rating -- that's a really impressive feat even though this also adds some likelihood questions. The story also does a really good job of driving the audience to discuss several issues after the film ends.The Bad: Some clunky dialogue. Some over acting in parts. Some scenes were too long. Although I enjoyed the ending, it brings up some questions of plausibility. Not a lot of character development -- I personally never felt too connected to any of the characters -- interestingly though, I still cared about the outcome.",Antebellum

Mone knocked it out the park with her acting and I hope to see more of her in years to come. Well worth the rental. So many themes to reflect on. How humanity treats each other. How fear and deep insecurity destroys everyone white and black. I love how the scene with the little girl is played out throughout the movie. Are you going to be friends? The degree to which we hate each other and ourselves is also captured masterfully. The way masochistic behavior destroy lives. Excellent! And let's not forget the gender role reversals, white privilege, and denial revealed. This was a horror movie and thrilling to imagine how much of this takes place today.",Antebellum

This is somewhere between thriller, semi-mystery, and drama. No horror here or whatsoever you initially thought of. Third, the story is just short, expanded to 1hr 40 minutes. You can definitely summarize the whole film into one sentence. But for the sake of not giving spoilers, I will not. Fourth, the trailer definitely misleads you. It is not fantasy, mystery, horror, sci fi movie. It is only a simple drama, thriller, and a semi-mystery movie. Fifth, it feels like it tries to be ""Get Out"" but ultimately fails on all levels. In my opinion, it has no depth, no thrill, and not enough symbolisms. Will make you feel like it is an attempt on trying to be a ""Get out"" movie, but falls very incredibly short.

There were some small flaws here and there, especially with the directing and some of the acting (Jenna Malone, especially), and I agree that the trailer is very misleading, but I actually liked that, it brought some element of surprise. Janelle Monae was amazing in it and there were a few surprises that really caught me off guard.
I rarely write reviews here, but I thought I had to, cause after seeing the rating for this movie, I decided at first not to watch it. Saw a lot of reviews saying it was bad and not even a horror movie. Well, I finally saw it and now I understand why there's a lot of angry and salty people here reviewing.
Every time a movie depicts the horrors of slavery and racism, there's a lot of people that rush in just to say it was awful, or over the top, not true or boring.
It's ok to not like the movie, but saying it wasn't even horror is just a lie. Every story about slavery is a horror story. If you see this movie and don't think that's true, maybe you are part of the problem.",Antebellum
400,seandoel,"Is this movie ""political""?",7,19 September 2020,"I'm perplexed that some reviewers on here have labelled the movie ""political"". As far as I'm aware there remains no political parties that deny the abhorrence of slavery nor racial oppression. This movie does not villanize white people, it villanizes villains. Moreover, the motives of the villains are undeclared and ambiguous - although there are hints at racial motivations but these are left for the viewers interpretation. To classify the movie as political suggests the producers had a political statement to make or political motivation. One can only presume that is to say they are suggesting racism still exists. This of course is not up for debate, its fact, it DOES. This is not political. There is a reason as to why the 'slave owners' are white and the 'slaves' are black. *The answer is left as an exercise for the reader.*
As a white man I am no more ashamed of the white villains in this movie as I am to white bond villains. I am not them.One reviewer asked a question about the movie and questioned its continuity in doing so, so I thought I'd explain:The reason Veronica doesn't have branding in the shower scene is simply because she hasn't been branded yet. After she wakes from the initial slavery scenes she hasn't dreamed that at all, it's a con, and it works. There are two time lines and they jump between them but the slavery scenes all succeed the ""normal"" scenes.They also ask about why do they burn the cotton. Well why not burn the cotton? What else are they to do with it? They aren't really running a plantation to profit from cotton, it's not for sale.",Antebellum

This movie had the potential to be very interesting .One that would of been a must see, but it falls short. At first I was intrigued as well as excited,but as the movie shifted to the last part I started to get a sense of where it was heading. It just was not as clever as I had thought it would be. It is missing so much of the story and creative elements that you are left wanting. The ending twist is revealed so quickly, it makes the twist stupid. If it would of been presented in a different way it may have changed my impressions.
I will say it is visually appealing but that doesn't make up for the substance it lacks. I will tell you truly the last thoughts and feeling I had when the ending credits started was ""What it is over, where is the rest?"" Followed by a feeling of thorough disappointment.

That whole beginning long-take was absolutely stunning. Some very meticulous cinematography and actors setting up the plot. But, let's go over the facts. The whole movie is curtailing the success of Get Out. So much so, that they plaster it on the marketing and trailers, confusing audiences what this movie is actually about. Was it about time travel? Alternate universe? No. I'm trying to remain spoiler free here, but this one hook was relied on too much for the movie to be successful. Almost like a successor to Get Out. But also not, trying to capture the strengths of both movies, instead looking like an expirement for audience feedback. In fact, watching it a second time makes every scene pointless as you understand the motives behind all the characters. I loved this trick, sadly it can only be used once. Then there's the whole, white men are bad motif, which sadly Hollywood is picking up on. So I gave it a 6 star rating which is mostly because that fantastic beginning.

The narrative is drug out way too long, and way, WAY too much time is spent on trite character superficialities, instead of actual character development.As for the ""twist:"" it is hard for me to judge this, because a review I read beforehand (here on IMDB, of all places!) had an unannounced spoiler in the HEADLINE (by way of a reference to another movie - - people need to consider these things when they write reviews)!

443,MarionR3,I enjoyed this movie.,10,17 February 2021,"The dynamics of this movie are broad and for what has seemed quite formulaic we've become accustomed to watching a movie catagorically. This movie crossed lines. Self-made, self-empowered Black woman is kidnapped by a group of people who wish to have the oligarchic control that the 19th century offered white people. The best educated, accomplished are referred to as 'inferiors'. They are not allowed to openly communicate because that may allow them to formulate a plan of escape or retaliation. This is a 'horror' in the sense that there exist those who would act in this manner, seek to conscript away the best of African and African-American descendants.Their is another side to this story. The depraved nature of coordination and planning which occurs in the minds of these whites who execute and support this (in the movie of course).Considering the events which have happened as of late, that is the schema under which our society is currently struggling with itself. The movie illuminated the pretense that regardless of how much progress African-American descended people may have made, their achievements have not become protection against their violation or exploitation for the sake of a few.

452,gijsbrans,Promising but disappointing,5,19 January 2021,"Having the same producer as ""Get out"" and ""Us"", I was looking forward to yet another thrilling masterpiece that also commented on racism. From the very opening scene it seems as if the movie will deliver. The scene is shot beautifully and accompanied by a unsettling score. It immediately shows us the brutality of life on a plantation. It also shows us the beautiful direction this movie has. While the color saturation was a bit much in my personal opinion (although that may just be a matter of taste), the direction is definitely full of style and beautiful imagery.As we get introduced to the characters the movie stays on top of it. The performances given by the actors and actresses are great. The main character, Eden, is portrayed by Janelle Monáe and she definitely delivers on her performance. She plays one of the slaves living on the plantation, and a new arrival (Kiersey Clemons) ask her to help her to escape.As the plot on the plantation progresses the movie switches to the modern day. Here we get introduced to Veronica, also portrayed by Janelle Monáe. It is unclear whether Eden and Veronica are the same person or different people all together, but there definitely is a connection. At this point the movie gives off alternate reality or time travel vibes, but either way there has to be a twist somewhere.The modern day part of the movie contains a lot of exposition, and it isn't nearly as interesting as the previous scenes on the plantation. Veronica is an sociologist who gives lectures about institutionalized racism in the US, but the movie doesn't really dive deeper into that topic. Some creepy things happen in the hotel where Veronica is staying, as well as when she goes out with some friends. I won't elaborate as not to give spoilers.It is after this that the twist happens, and it is utterly disappointing. The people on the plantation have known about it the whole time but conveniently avoided talking about it, which makes some of the dialogue not make much sense in retrospect. There is also no room for nuance on the topic of racism in this movie, as there was in ""Get out"" and ""Us"". It is all really obvious. Because of that I never felt like this movie ever had much to say about it other than ""racism bad"". The twist itself wasn't even the bad thing necessarily, it is the way it was set up and delivered. Some quite ridiculous action occurs following the twist, which doesn't help the movie. It's not that hard to see what the writers were going for with this, but it feels like they didn't develop it properly. One wonders if it was rushed to get it out during the BLM protests that were going on around the world. The movie also never really managed to pull off its horror in my opinion.In the end, this movie sets up an interesting premise, but it fails to deliver and doesn't have a valuable message to convey about racism either. I was hoping for a thrilling movie with an intelligent comment on society, but I left the theater disappointed.",Antebellum

I've rated it 10 because I feel the low ratings are unwarranted and could put people off - overall I think it is probably a 7.5.I wonder if people are disappointed because they were drawn in by the 'horror' label and comparisons to 'Us' and 'Get Out' - this film is NOT your typical horror (the pacing is quite relaxed, there aren't any jump scares etc) and should be promoted as more of a mystery / thriller - if you are looking for a proper horror film then this won't be what you want.I found the story interesting but just as a warning, it is quite hard to watch as the content is distressing and I did have to stop it a couple of times, but I think the message is very important and I'm glad the directors were bold enough to do this.Please do yourself a favour and don't read anything about the story beforehand: just watch it with an open mind, don't expect too much and you may be pleasantly surprised.",Antebellum

As a white woman who's always lived in a multi-cultural city in the UK, been lucky enough to travel the world and have friends and family from different countries and backgrounds I feel very fortunate.I hate unfairness and am horrified by 'man's inhumanity to man' in any guise, era, place.So this was shocking and gut-wrenching.The micro-aggressions also annoyed me and made the perpetrators look cheap and nasty. The lead character handled them with grace and tolerance.The twist was good and thought-provoking. As a Brit living in a wonderful friendly mountain village where all are welcome I am grateful for good people in our world.I was an onlooker to Trump's America and horrified by what seemed like a 50+ year backward slide in so many ways.This film was definitely a horror film by my definition and I think the writers, cast and crew did an amazing job.

468,martijnnoordhuis,Gripping movie with minor flaws,7,9 October 2020,"Before watching this movie I'd read a few articles covered on BloodyDisgusting, but I hadn't seen any trailers, so I went into the movie neutral. I had the pleasure of seeing it in a cinema.The first act was hard for me to watch with the systematic physical en mental torture of 'slaves'. Nothing too gory was shown which helped the psychological suspense and trauma I was experiencing. Up until the second act I thought this was going to be a gripping period movie about slavery. I especially apreciated the serious tone of the first act which was complemented with great cinematography and the acting of Janelle Monáe as Eden/Veronica.The second act had a surprise twist and it kept me guessing which direction the makers were going for. This is something I don't mind, if done well, and in the case of 'Antebellum' I think they tackled it well. In terms of story twists and designing them it made me think of 'I See You' (2019), another great movie I recently watched during the pandemic or 'Incident in a Ghostland' (2018).
The tonal shift in acting in the second act stood out a bit after the seriousness off the first act like the character of Jena Malone, who underwent a slight change in acting from serious to campy. The family of Veronica, although cute, felt a bit too sugarcoated for my taste acting wise. But especially Gabourey Sidibe's character was guilty of overacting, something she doesn't do in other roles like Precious (2009) which also has a butterfly on its movieposter. It not only made her character very one-dimensional, rude and unauthentic, but it forced the other characters also to make a tonal shift in acting. In the end it didn't ruin the movie, but it kept me from rating it with 9 stars.
I did like the subtle racial vibes from the hoteldesk worker reacting non-verbally to Veronica and the awkward table placement in the restaurant she arranged.The ending, although brief, paid off for me. It's scary there are people who think of black people as an inferior species who organize themselve to erradicate them and their rights right under our nose in ways of a hobby. This made the horror feel real for me because it's a reflection of what's still happening on a daily basis to this day.Many reviewers compare this movie to the 'The Village' from 2004, but I see more connections with 'Hostel' (2005) in which an evil organization kidnap and torture innocent people for pleasure. Change those psychopaths to racist psychopaths and the tourists to black people and it makes for an equal disturbing but less schlocky experience.I see many 1 star 'reviews', without any elaboration, telling the movie sucks because it's not horror or because people felt tricked by the promotion of this movie.

Anyone who failed to do this, or didn't think that's what the film required in order for them to respect its appeal should probably stick with mindless summer blockbusters.Me? I prefer the realism - the grit - that films such as this provide. Films like this rely on more than just the words of the actors to convey thoughts and emotions. This film provokes both, and it does so very well. I genuinely hope to see more creativity and more deviation from so many films that are nothingmovies.",Antebellum

Characters are poor and stereotyped, motivations of the ""bad guys"" are poor and stereotyped, there is only one major plot twist, and it's totally wasted as of action timing. The ending is dull and predictable.
Also, there is a lot of unnecessary propaganda of a certain ideology (summed up in ""white men are evil"") that wastes 1/3 of the movie without really adding something to the narrative.

While I am a Black Man critic of the movie, it is a very sad movie to watch but it is true to the culture of racism and how White people Today. I loved how the comparison of silvery and modern time because it shows you how we live these days with the police brutally. I am beyond happy that this isn't the reality of a true story.Well, I did my research on the movie and the Director. Gerald Bush is phenomenal. I was surprised to find out that he is a person of color and he dreamt this as a story from his ancestor telling him this story and to make it known to educate and to remind people how awful Slavery was and it's a comparison of Today's racism. It not only the comparison it's how closely is similar.This movie has great artistry, filming is beyond unexpected, it has it's a twist that you'll never guess which why it was going. The acting was well performed. I believed everyone in the team should be recognized with the Rights of respect and awards. The plot of the story was on point with its similarities between Slavery and Morden Day.Now to speak of the rating the was rated low because I believe it's to derive its deserving attention of the movie and its Rights to awards and recognition.",Antebellum

Just look out of your windows or watch your television.I've told all of my friends to watch it, get past the first 20 minutes and then settle in for a rather different kind of movie ride. This film is like no other but is LONG OVERDUE. Nobody wants to be reminded of slavery, much less on the big screen. BELOVED was mystical, a thriller and showed the brutality of slavery. And the public hated it.

Meanwhile, they could have given more attention to the personal stories of the people involved, or how the situation came to be and so on, so you'd identify with the characters more.

I watched it and had low expectations but it blew my mind. There were some moments that could've been improved, but I certainly don't think it's a bad movie, far from it. One of the better horror movies I've watched, which shows us that humans are the true monsters. No reliance on errant technology, aliens or the supernatural, just the darkness in the human spirit.
Similar to Get Out in a way, but scarier because, well, it could happen.The escape and fight near the end was slightly frustrating, just because I felt like there were a lot of openings to kill the Senator, but other than that it was a great movie, and the revenge at the end, with Elizabeth - brilliant. Again, I think the fighting could have been a little better, but I guess I should remember these people have been malnourished for at least a few weeks and have been worked to the bone in the burning sun.A good movie, and I wouldn't mind a sequel in the same universe, maybe showing something similar in another place.Janelle Monae really did her thing, I'd definitely like to see more of her in more action-filled roles.",Antebellum

I think it was weird how that one guy snuck a phone even though they weren't supposed to have one??? Was answering calls in the middle of the night???? Super unrealistic and dumb The reason she got kidnapped made no sense whatsoever. The foreshadowing racism in the middle of the movie was a good addition. The movie took way too long to start in the beginning. 10 minutes of chasing for two semi major characters.

The actors and actresses felt authentic in every emotion they portrayed. At first I thought that Antebellum was the story of a woman escaping from slavery... but it's so much more than that. It's about a woman who is fighting the continuing battle for those who came before her-in a more modern way through her activism but also experiencing their struggles in real life. This movie encouraged me to do more research on the systemic racism in our country and to really look into and try to understand the stories of those who are speaking up against it. Thank you for this movie.

The reviews saying it was gory is insane considering I watch the Halloween and Hellraiser films for fun. Maybe it's the truth behind the horror that makes people upset. The context of this film and the thoughts that flooded my mind after seeing it makes my heart hurt which is why it's hard to say I love this film. I'm happy it's out here for the world but the content hurts the strains of my DNA. For white and black children who think the plantation era is so distant in the past and hard to visualize, it's a perfect film to show the true nature of this countries history and the glorification that's still reenacted.

The lead actress was for sure EMPOWERING and portrayed the very essence of a STRONG AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMAN who refused to give up despite the adversity and obstacles put in front of her.Most will watch this movie for face value, but its definitely NOT THAT TYPE OF MOVIE! As time passes, we often forget about the past as it is not what WE ARE CURRENTLY experiencing however this movie is a GREAT REMINDER that we should NOT forget, and we should use the motivation of our ancestors to persevere and continue to strive for EQUALITY as it is our RIGHTS as (1) Humans and as (2) Americans.Let this movie not fuel hatred, but to spark consciousness and to open your minds eye. Let this movie further make you aware that this country is currently being lead by an individual who incites hatred and racial inequality. Let this movie allow you to question WHEN WAS AMERICA EVER GREAT? since someone opts to say to ""make it great AGAIN."".Bravo to the cast and staff who put this movie together!!! And for those who see this review, receive the actual message the movie is conveying. As one of the confederate generals in the movie states ""we are nowhere and everywhere"" ... Let that resonate in your mind for a bit as we are STILL experiencing SOCIAL INJUSTICE just as those did centuries ago.",Antebellum

549,watsojs,Antebellum,10,26 September 2020,"I think we need to focus on the fact that this is a good movie. We need to learn that what goes on in this movie might be going on in the real world. This movie is very educational me as a 15-year old I wonder and I know this is going on. Slavery might be going on discreetly in the U.S. and kids and women are getting Sex Trafficked for no reason. Mainly black women and kids because some people might not agree to peace and the 13th Amendment. I think young kids should learn from this. The history that our teachers give us in a class all of the White individuals get recognized except for most of the black people. We need to be heard too, we need to be freed much more, we need to be equal and no violence. We shouldn't be judged by the color of our skin. We shouldn't be getting killed by police because of our skin color. Many black people should stand up for what's right. Were shouldn't get judged for the color of our skin because we are much more were human beings and as a Black teenager, I know we should. I think nowadays we should teach young black children about what's going on, THE TRUTH.

553,manitou-07778,Bad genre and bad presentation,1,27 September 2020,"Been to this movie just a few days ago, and compared to the movies 'us' and 'get out'. I will make two different points of the, in the title mentioned, subjects. First out the genre.The genre is completely incorrect.
Horror is nowhere to be found in this movie and it does not deserve that genre by any means. It's about as far of as giving 'conjuring' a comedie genre. It is just completely incorrect and if you want to watch a horror movie just go to any other one, even a bad one, is more horrific than this movie. Even the thriller genre annoys me a bit, because the biggest part of this movie you are just sitting and watching like... ''what exactly is the meaning of all of this?''Presentation
It has a more documentary vibe at first, and while doing that it is wrong on most parts, this is being fixed at the end of the movie. End meaning: really the end. Except this it is just a movie that bothers everyone with a bit of historical knowledge, this being fixed by the end for most parts, but still it really creates a feel that is historically incorrect.Conclusion
I can tell you i got the clue of this movie. In the end most of the people will be guessing what exactly is the point of this movie, as in, what was the actual story line etc. I did get the point, ofcourse i cant spoiler it so i won't, but i do get the point. I can't get out of my mind that this is a movie completely made to add to the racism debate. But doing it this way is just wrong, in my opinion. You can't release a movie presenting a historical view, that is incorrect, into the debate like this. Most people will not see the mistakes, because of the lack of historic knowledge about slavery. If the movie would've given the correct presentation on this point, i would give it a higher rating, but because it is full of biases about slavery, if it kept that out. It would at least be a correct presentation deserving a higher rate, but it has not.",Antebellum

560,niaanderso,A progressive work towards Understanding,10,3 October 2020,"The point of this movie is that the past influences the present. ""Antebellum"" is a movie that is beautifully shot - the colors, lighting, and textures that jump out at you are all very rich. It speaks a truth about the African-American experience, from past to present, that may be a little too real for some to digest (and they are regurgitating what America taught them through their unconvincing reviews). Those critics working for big name news agencies that have given poor reviews of the film, surprisingly authored by some people of color, are missing the point ... or are they? Begs the question of who they are working for and why they are attempting to stifle progress (exactly what this film is working against). As an African-American descendant of slaves living in America today, I understand what this film is portraying as it invites others in towards understanding some of the nuances of our culture. Just think of that face on the box of Uncle Ben's rice and why most of us who grew up in this country knew nothing about its very subtle and silent reminder of African rice growing knowledge and the early benefit it created for this great country (there are plenty of other examples that I won't get into here). ""Antebellum"" highlights the continuing American cultural practice of attempting to silence its original sin.",Antebellum
561,passionelizabeth,It's not as bad as they're saying!,7,4 October 2020,"This movie is about an enslaved woman by the name of Eden living on a plantation in the antebellum south (Louisiana). The plantation is very violent and cruel; the enslaved individuals are not allowed to talk without being beaten or killed. But here's the twist: these events are occurring in the year 2020 at a Civil War re-enactment. Eden, whose real name is Veronica, is an intelligent and successful author whom has been kidnapped and forced into this sick pseudo-world.I think this movie went over a lot of people's heads. Is it a typical Halloween/Friday the 13th/Nightmare on Elm Street horror movie? No. Is it a horror movie though? Yes. It's a horror movie because, in my opinion, there is nothing more horrific than chattel slavery. Now imagine being kidnapped and enslaved (raped, beaten, dehumanized, tortured, forced into grueling manual labor) in 2020. That's what Antebellum is. An psychological horror flick about being forced into slavery in modern society. It's very reminiscent of M. Night Shyamalan's ""The Village"" except in this movie, the characters know they have been kidnapped. They are fully aware there is no war and they are not slaves, but they have no idea where they are or what is happening.It seems as if the people who are mad didn't quite understand the message this movie conveys: racism is alive and well in the world we live in today. Racism exists in our society and many are oblivious to it. This is not a stupid movie!

Suggesting there are more pro slavery people out there, I wanted to see the movie explore that a little more & go further down the rabbit hole. 2) I think the timelines could've been more clear, it starts out suggesting this WAS happening in the time of slavery, only to discover that isn't the case, it was modern day the whole time, which had a ""the village"" feel to it.

You think it's flashing back and forth through history but then find out it's present day. Then you find out that she's being kept captive at a southern tourist trap.

The world feels the same. I'm gonna come out and say it but I feel like this movie was a try for a quick cash grab.

I do not want to spoil anything for anyone but I would just ask; how easy it is for people to disappear, how people do not care about old military statues until other people shine a light on bad behaviour, and why do we romanticise Sunday morning old man behaviour of something that was a horrific time in peoples lives.

That scene in the restaurant where she read Becky and the man who sent over the drink are classics! The frustration came when Monáe as Eden paused to look at the statue of Robert E.

606,jludley2000,Don't listen to the critics before making your own opinion.,8,21 September 2020,This movie was way more than what people are giving it credit for. I think with the current situation in the world people are making this out to be something its not. Most the people who are super critical are that way from a political standpoint and thats painfully obvious.This was a great piece of art and I really enjoyed it. Its a fictional story based off the past. It's a stretch on reality but so are many movies. For some this may have deeper meaning and you can't help but respect that for being what it is.Before watching this I read through the hate on here and listened to a couple YouTube reviews and people need to learn to separate themselves from their echo chambers. Im glad I seen this movie and I say that as a white man who doesn't want nothing to do with right or left wing ideologies. Way to go for a couple new comers in the movie industry! I look forward to what else is to come.,Antebellum

It had me guessing, the plot was interesting, and the stakes were believable. The revenge the main character gets is pretty epic and satisfying.I can see why a certain group might get butthurt about this movie, hence the lower-than-deserved score.

Absolutely ridiculous. 99% of white people would agree that racism is/was wrong.

This movie is not great because it does that, but because it is unapologetic and raw about its deliverance.

I believe this movie had a good written script but the execution failed poorly. It could've have been SO MUCH more and plus the way they advertised the movie was misleading, you're expecting a horror/thriller/paranormal type and what you got was a story to which you really didn't know what was happening til the middle of the movie. Acting was superb but there was so many random events there were never seen all the way through. Several loose ends.

I think if you go into this film with an open mind and some what of an imagination of what could be then you can see the next level thinking the creator was doing. While the story isn't that well developed and the characters are somewhat shallow I think that the actors pulled enough from their personal experience to make each one of their personalities seem true to form I don't normally watch slave movies so the prelim buzz made me think this was going to be more of the same. But I can say I really enjoyed this film from beginning to end. If you are looking for some light terror and a redemption at the end I think this will be a great evening watch with some conversation at the end.

It was supposed to be a horror movie but all it ended up being was a movie to try to show everyone how terrible white people are and what victims black people are. Yet we see the big black lady be terribly rude to the nice man that bought her a drink and came over to meet her. This movie thinks that's acceptable behavior. If I were a man I would be offended. This movie was offensive all around. And this was MY PICK! This is the worst movie in my lifetime and I'm 54 years old. The worst movie in my life before this was Random Hearts in 1999.

The threads of racism are ever present in this movie, and you can't help gasp at some of the moments of man's utter inhumanity to his fellow men and women. Then the film takes a different turn, and the echoes of the past thread their way into the attitudes and stories of the present, exposing some of the more latent messaging of the narrative. As a Scotsman living in Scotland it's seems another world away, both past and present, but I am acutely aware of how these threads emanate over the Atlantic, and have some of their origins from our shores.I felt gripped, shocked, sad and angry at the realities and possibilities of this film, and I hope this film serves as a grim reminder of how bad it was, and how far we have to go to correct the mistakes of the past, and build an equal uture for every man, regardless of race or colour.""Man to man the world o, shall brothers be for a' that""",Antebellum

I went in expecting the plot that more or less played out. I do agree that ""horror"" is not really the right genre to categorized this movie. I would say it's more like a psychological thriller.I'm actually between a 7 and an 8 on this film. I went with the 7 because I do believe there is a lot more that could have been done in this story. That being said, I definitely think this would have been better suited for.a limited run series. With a series, they could have used the great slow burn vibe they achieve early in the movie. It feels to me like we're getting an abridged version. My primary disappointment with the film is that I wanted a more fulfilling ending.

If you don't think this story is in the realm of possibility, then you should read about Jaycee Dugard who was held captive for almost 20 years.

Janelle Monae is such an evolving force on screen. I have enjoyed watching her in various screen ventures. Her character in this film is exactly what it needs to be to carry the weight of the story line. She perfectly teeters on the edges of that modern day dream ""grind"" and the shadowed corners of what that grind is and/or will become with loss of focus. There is a darkness to the truth that some watchers will get instantly. Others will struggle with it because they see it as fantasy and untrue, these are the kinds of people who tell others to get over being raped and believe that all lives matters means other lives don't.

Having seen her in Homecoming (season 2) on Prime, I was already a fan. So, this made the film even better. At the beginning, the film gave me the sense that this was a horror film set in the past with the main character in a fight for her life. It was hard to watch the violence and brutality - but, I felt things had to take a turn and something else was going on. So, I kept watching. Then, the film changes suddenly, and we are transported forward into the future. The main character is back in modern life, with a family and successful career as an author and activist. Things feel safe. Just a bad dream? I thought the plot would go one of two ways: past lives/past trauma flashback, or the sequence of events were being revealed out of order.

672,alexander_amador,A poor effort.,4,11 October 2020,"A strong establishing scene full of promise - promises it fails to keep. Stilted dialogue, forced acting, and a big, bluff twist makes it a unsatisfying experience all-in-all.",Antebellum
673,dolbysiana,Good,7,20 September 2020,"I wish the movie was more in-depth, but other than that it was good!",Antebellum
674,bt-42729,"Should have been titled ""What The Hell""",6,19 September 2020,"I say this because that's what I kept saying through the first half of the movie. My first issue is that it was billed as a horror- so that's what I'm expecting to see, so that was a major disappointment. After getting over that I found the story interesting and entertaining enough to not be disappointed in purchasing it.",Antebellum
675,wellsadams,Solid film,10,21 September 2020,Picks up where Us and Get Out left off. Thought provoking and appropriate for our current political climate.,Antebellum
676,nyatnight,Low ratings are ridiculous and literally dishonest,9,8 January 2021,"I admit that I hesitated to watch this film. The too many contradictions in the comments puzzled me. Now that I have watched it, I can finally share my review. By the way, this is my first review here. I couldn't help but write this first review because the bad ratings seem totally ridiculous and incredibly dishonest to me. First, I wondered if the bad ratings came from Americans. You see, I live in Quebec, so slavery, a constraint in the United States, does not represent a big part of my history. So it seems obvious to me that some Americans may have felt offended, judged and despised. So probably a lot of bad ratings are coming from there. Then I wanted to make sure that the film was realistic and not a bunch of exaggerations and propaganda inspired by a certain political left and the ""Black lives matter"" movement, which I would not have appreciated at all. I hate when filmmakers use their work to get their own political message across. My opinion? Absolutely not. I found this film to be quite honest. Then, well, it's not too much of a spoiler anymore, but yes, we can separate the film into three parts. In the first one, I believe that one honestly portrayed what life as a slave could have looked like. In the second part of the film, we see more of where an African American is or what he can aspire to now. In the last portion of the film, we probably see the fantasy of several people in the United States; the return to this beautiful era ... as well as the expression of an inner rage, of an African-American, which explodes using a lot of symbolism in various scenes. Finally, I really liked the visual of the film. The broad daylight scenes reminded me of Midsommar. In short, I loved this film. If my review speaks to you, ignore the bad (very bad) reviews and go for it. Good time guaranteed.",Antebellum

680,ccam-03609,WATCH THIS!,10,20 September 2020,"Disregard all the negative reviews and comments. The right individuals will understand this movie and its context. This movie skillfully and rightfully depicts America today - masking the horrors of our past in the name of ""patriotism"" and heritage.Keep your eyes and ears open while watching this! EVERYTHING is shown for a purpose and reason - details! Details like the house slaves uniform is the exact uniform worn by the hotel's housekeeping staff. Touches like that you'll miss if you're only looking at this for face value. This movie has sooo much! Love it!",Antebellum

682,simonegenovese-77415,A movie that gets into your mind.,10,16 November 2020,"This is a movie for thinking, mature adults. It is also not for haters, It is not a movie for quick thrills, and instant satisfaction. It makes you think. It gets in your mind and forces you to consider what you just saw and the meanings of the images. This movie is loaded with symbolisms and symbols, hidden meanings, and foreshadowing. A wonderful movie. We need more of these.",Antebellum

684,sanaria-1,Great movie with an interesting twist,9,26 September 2020,"I initially thought the movie was trashy because I was confused as hell But as everything begin to come together, I realized it was a great concept. If you like movies like Sixth Sense and The Others, you will love this movie. The purpose of the movie was not to give away the plot. If ppl have a problem with the racial undertones or depictions of slavery, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM!!! If you don't believe things like this could happen, wake up. we have seen news stories with neighbors doing the most.",Antebellum
