0,bkoganbing,I Blew My College Tuition For Love And Revenge,4,3 November 2008,"Now I'm not totally against these teen angst brat pack films that were so popular in the Eighties and John Hughes was associated with some good ones. But the notion that Eric Stoltz could trash his whole college education tuition fund on an act of revenge against some rich kid is really a bit bizarre. Not a great message to be sending out there John.But that's what you have in Some Kind Of Wonderful. Eric Stoltz is this misfit kid, probably born a generation too late, he'd have fit right into the Sixties. What he did would be something kids did back then. They also were a lot less focused, like he is, heck like I was and wished now I wasn't. Young Eric wants to be an artist, his parents have saved and scrimped for college tuition. My God he could take art in school for that matter. But now he's made because a rich young punk played very nicely by Craig Sheffer puts him down on general principles and because Stoltz is crushing out on one of his girl friends, Lea Thompson. In the meantime, tomboy girl Mary Stuart Masterson thinks Stoltz is just the greatest thing around, but he can't see for the rich princess Masterson just dazzles him.Sheffer even encourages Thompson to play up to Stoltz to get him to a preppy party that he's throwing so he and some friends can beat up Stoltz. How Eric deals with this situation makes up the remainder of the film.I think the parents were right on about Stoltz and this expensive gesture he was making. But I'm sure the attractiveness and capability of the players in this film were what the audience was watching instead of the stupid message that Some Kind Of Wonderful was giving out.",Some Kind of Wonderful
1,SnoopyStyle,high school fable,8,25 January 2016,"Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz), Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) and Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) are all from the wrong side of the tracks. Keith is secretly in love with Amanda. His tomboy drummer best friend Watts is secretly in love with him. Amanda is going out with possessive rich kid Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer). Amanda gets detention. Keith deliberately gets detention but she gets out. He befriends school ruffian Duncan (Elias Koteas) while in detention. Amanda has enough of Hardy and accepts a date from Keith. Keith's father Cliff Nelson (John Ashton) just wants him to concentrate on getting into college.Directed by Howard Deutch and written by John Hughes, this duo delivers another 80s classic teen movie. The actors are a little older in this one compared to the earlier John Hughes teen movies. That holds it back a little. The humor is less silly. The story is more romance oriented. I love all three leads. It's a great teen romance fable.",Some Kind of Wonderful
2,Prismark10,It could had been a Back to the Future reunion.,6,17 October 2018,"Before writer John Hughes got stuck in a formula of the Home Alone movies that bought him paydirt. He dealt with teenage angst, especially the working class kind and contrasted those with the rich spoilt kids.I was a college student in Britain at the time this film was released. I used to walk or bike to college. A lot of my friends arrived by bus. That some kids arrived to Senior High school in marque cars in America was just an alien concept to us, heck a lot of us could not even afford the insurance to drive to college in a cheap clapped out jalopy.Some Kind Of Wonderful stars Eric Stoltz as Keith. He works in a garage, his best friend is a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) who also works in the garage with him. Keith's dad wants him to go to college. He has been saving for years so his son can be the first person in the family to not get his hands dirty.Keith is infatuated by Amanda (Lea Thompson), the well to do girl who his going out with a brattish rich kid who is mean to her and even cheats on her. What Keith does not see is that Watts is in love with him. When Keith manages to ask Amanda out for a date, the rich kid plans to give him a beating but Keith has been charming the local bullies at school.John Hughes had a rather skewed view of blue collar America. It was plainly unrealistic. The characters seem to be cardboard cutouts. The actors playing high school students were just too old and some of them at the time never got the hang of this acting game such as Elias Koteas.Stolz is rather creepy, always stalking Amanda, something her boyfriend notices. Masterson was the standout but no way was she a tomboy. She was much too attractive and Keith should had been right up there tuning up her engine.Yet it is still a fun film of its time. I remember buying the soundtrack of this movie.",Some Kind of Wonderful
3,mark.waltz,"Realistically, this is some kind of unbelievable.",5,22 December 2017,"Other than Eric Stoltz, I found the teen characters here completely unrealistic, some of them of late college age, and others either totally unlikable, badly acted, or empty inside where it counts. At times I thought Mary Stuart Masterson came off zombie like, and other times, completely out of character for what she was playing when fully at attention in the part. She's an outsider, hating the A group (can't blame her for that...) and at times to only want friendship with Stoltz then staring at him strangely. A girl's locker room sequence is completely uncomfortable to watch as she looks on at the basically nice Lea Thompson with a combination of lust and loathing. Camera shots going down Thompson's panty clad body is severely gratuitous. Then there's Stoltz's family: a father who interferes in his desires for his own future, completely obnoxious and despicable; the mother who seemingly ignores her daughter's out of preference for her son; and the two younger sisters, one just absolutely unlikable and self centered, and the baby just longing for some kind of attention and getting none. The only thing about that family I liked was seeing one of my all time favorite soap divas (Jane Elliott) playing a far cry from Tracy Quartermain as a working class mother. The situation of Thompson apparently using Stoltz to get back at old boyfriend Craig Scheffer was absurd, cliched and boring, presenting an obnoxious story that shows a generation who would now be parents of post college age adults acting just as badly as the young generation today. No wonder adults ignored my generation when I was a teen, and no wonder why my generation ignores high school age kids today!",Some Kind of Wonderful
4,claudio_carvalho,Another Gem from the Wonderful 80´s,7,23 September 2018,"The teenager Keith (Eric Stoltz) is a high-school student and mechanic that lives with his working class family. His father´s ambition is that Keith goes to college but it not his priority since he loves Arts. His best friend is the tomboy Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson) and the girl of his dreams is the popular Amanda (Lea Thompson). When she breaks up with his wealthy boyfriend Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer), Keith invites Amanda to date and she accepts to get even of Hardy. But the rich boy plans a scheme to humiliate the couple with his friends. Meanwhile Watts discovers her true feelings for Keith. ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" is another gem from the wonderful 80´s. This feature presents a successful young generation of actors and actresses and it is highly nostalgic and entertaining to watch it again thirty and something years after its release. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Alguém Muito Especial"" (""Someone Very Special"")",Some Kind of Wonderful
5,classicsoncall,"""Mess with the bull, you get the horns. You know what I'm saying?""",7,10 July 2018,"The story itself is fairly predictable - the rich, good looking guy who's a manipulative jerk is going out with the school's hottest chick, while on the other side of the tracks, a loner works as a mechanic and hangs out with a tomboy who finds it hard to hide her feelings about him. It all plays out in a fairly realistic high school setting, as writer John Hughes explores teenage angst once again in a milieu he's come to be identified with. What's different about this story, and it's kind of refreshing, is that the teens aren't hopping in and out of bed with each other, and wind up going through some personal self analysis before they rearrange their relationships to ones that make sense. Watching this film some three decades after it's original release, and with all the emphasis in the current culture on equality between the sexes, it was somewhat jarring to hear egomaniac Hardy (Craig Sheffer) refer to Amanda (Lea Thompson) as his 'property'. I know there are guys who think like that but to actually hear him say it was more than enough to merit a trashing. I thought all the principal players did a fine job in their roles, with Mary Stuart Masterson particularly effective as the overlooked tomboy who's patience and integrity is rewarded in the end. One thing about the closing credits puzzled me, in as much as the would-be bully who turned out to be Keith Nelson's (Eric Stoltz) friend had the name of Duncan, but the name that appeared in the credits was 'Skinhead', and his pals were referred to as Skinhead's friends. I think it's the first time I've seen a corrected credit here on IMDb that doesn't reference the actor's character as it appeared in a movie's credited cast list.",Some Kind of Wonderful
6,gavin6942,Second-Rate Hughes Film,6,10 June 2015,"A young tomboy, Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith (Eric Stoltz), run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school. Unfortunately, the girl's old boyfriend, who is from the rich section of town, is unable to let go of her, and plans to get back at Keith.When you ask people to list the John Hughes films, chances are they will get three or four almost immediately, maybe struggle with one or two, and then forget about a handful. This is definitely part of that handful. Despite some good casting (Lea Thompson!), this is nothing more than a second-rate Hughes film. No Molly Ringwald, and sort of a rehash of the friend-who-likes-a-friend theme he had already done.Worth seeing? Of course. But this should not be on anyone's top five Hughes movie lists. (No doubt it is, but those people are wrong.)",Some Kind of Wonderful
7,Tweekums,Some Kind of Average,5,10 August 2009,"I hadn't watched this film for many years but following writer John Hughes untimely death decided to watch one of his less well known films again. Unlike his better known films like ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" this seems far more dated, it also doesn't help that the main character's behaviour towards the girl of his dreams is bordering on stalking.Eric Stoltz plays Keith, a high school student who is besotted by the beautiful Amanda Jones, played by Lea Thompson. She is already in a relationship though, with rich boy Hardy who treats her like his property. Early on Keith admires her from afar, sketching her during class and hanging around places she was likely to be, even deliberately getting himself in to detention after he overhears her being given detention. When Amanda finally has had enough of her boy friend Keith plucks up courage to ask her out. All the while Keith's closest friend, tomboy Watts played by Mary Stuart Masterson, is cautioning him that any involvement with Amanda will only lead to him getting hurt. This advice isn't entirely selfless as she has an obvious crush on him although he is oblivious to this.Claiming to want to show that there are no hard feelings Hardy invites Keith and Amanda to a party he is throwing. Even though Keith knows it is a trick he decides to go, but only after he has taking Amanda on a date where Watts acts as their driver. Of course the film ends with Keith successfully standing up to Hardy and ending up with the girl he is meant to be with.The acting is good enough although in common with most high school films the cast are a bit too old with most of them being closer to thirty than twenty let alone school age. Mary Stuart Masterson did well as Watts, my favourite character, although it is hard to believe that Keith didn't notice her as more than a friend; it is as if the creators thought a short hair cut and grungy clothes can make an obviously beautiful girl look plain and unattractive.While I think this film had a lot of faults I wouldn't advise everybody to avoid it, if you like high school romances and don't mind a bit of cheesiness you might really enjoy it.",Some Kind of Wonderful
8,moonspinner55,The haves and have-nots among high schoolers (again),6,2 December 2007,"Practically a role-reversal of ""Pretty in Pink"" from that film's screenwriter, John Hughes--though it does feature pleasant performances and a tuneful alt-rock soundtrack. Eric Stoltz seems to be a happy high school misfit until he falls for the class beauty (Lea Thompson), a popular girl in a precarious situation (she's not the privileged teen she appears to be). A light, inoffensive confection, yet one with a far-fetched ending that swaps the kid's college tuition for a pair of really expensive earrings (Stoltz, fighting with his incredulous Pop about his future, says, ""I know what I'm doing!"" though it's clear he doesn't). Hughes creates bright, appealing outcasts (and he loves them), yet he situates them in the same old social position: envious of the popular clique, they're always on the verge of crossing over--until they realize that being on the outside is just where they belong! It's the standard high school fantasy, yet Stoltz, Thompson, Mary Stuart Masterson and Elias Koteas are fun to spend time with. **1/2 from ****",Some Kind of Wonderful
9,studioAT,Something quite wonderful here,6,6 September 2016,"John Hughes was sort of the master at this kind of film, producing lots in quick succession around similar themes. This is perhaps my favourite of his work.It's a simple story, beautifully told, with three good central performances. As with any Hughes film the music equally plays its part to good effect as well.I know that 'Breakfast Club' is the best known of Hughes' 80's comedies, with 'Pretty in Pink' also having a strong following, but for me there are so many lovely moments within this film that it's stuck with me the more times I see it.I can only recommend you take a look at it yourself.",Some Kind of Wonderful
10,hitchcockthelegend,It must be a drag to be a slave to the male sex drive.,9,15 August 2009,"Keith Nelson, much to everyone else's surprise, lands a date with Amanda Jones, the most popular girl in school. But with Amanda comes trouble in the form of the ex-boyfriend, Hardy Jenns. A rich spoilt egotistical bully, Jenns plans to get back at Keith violently. While things are further complicated by the fact that Keith's best friend Watts is hopelessly in love with him, something that Keith is oblivious too. All roads, rocky or otherwise, are leading to one house party where lives are about to be changed.Released a year after Pretty In Pink, writer John Hughes further cemented his status as the king of teenage angst with this funny, charming and entertaining picture. Following a similar formula to that used in Pretty In Pink, Some Kind Of Wonderful deals not only in young love thematics, but also in opposites breaking down barriers, bullies and the spectre of parental pressure. Keith (Eric Stoltz) is from humble working class stock, the idea of dating the more affluent Amanda (Lea Thompson) would seem idiotic at best. The characters may move in different circles, but Hughes, as is his want, thrusts the issue to the front whilst dangling little strands in the background. Time is given to the father (an impressive John Ashton) and son axis, where career pressure is raised. And the delightful old chestnut of fitting in at school, or not as the case may be as regards Watts (a tremendous and sensual Mary Stuart Masterton) is also putting in an appearance.It's often forgotten in Hughes ""angsty"" films, that they aren't merely love stories for the young and restless. They are all encompassing pieces that hold up better than ever on revisits today. Yes there is pandering to certain expectations, and yes the endings never veer away from a tried and trusted method. But Hughes knew what worked for him and his audience. That he never attempted to insult us (them) with sledgehammer tactics, or trick of the twist dallying, is really rather refreshing when viewing them today. Some Kind Of Wonderful is quite simply a wonderful film, with great comedy (check out the fabulous Elias Koteas) and a banging soundtrack, it ranks as one of the finest efforts crafted from the pen of a very fine writer. 9/10",Some Kind of Wonderful
11,Wuchakk,"Working class boy, rich dream girl and faithful tomboy friend in Southern Cal",7,27 July 2019,"Keith (Eric Stoltz) is a high school senior in Los Angeles wherein he fights with his little sister (Maddie Corman) and is pestered by his dad about going to college. He works at a gas station and his best friend is a tomboy, Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), but he has his eyes set on a dream girl, Amanda (Lea Thompson). Craig Sheffer plays the rich stud nemesis, Hardy.Writer John Hughes was known for those mid-80's high school films, like ""Sixteen Candles,"" ""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off."" Unsuccessful when it was released in 1987, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" ended his foray in the genre and he would go on to popular comedies with John Candy and Chevy Chase.This movie is interesting in that it includes elements of ""Pretty in Pink"" (1986) and, indeed, features the ending that was intended for that movie, which the studio forced him to alter. Hughes even wanted Molly Ringwald for the role of Amanda, but she refused and Hughes took it personally, which ended their working relationship.It's about on par with ""Pretty in Pink,"" but I prefer the cast in this one, plus it's more heartwarming. I'd watch it any day over the overrated ""Breakfast Club,"" yet it has its issues. For instance, some scenes have the same sense of unreality that marred ""Pink"" and Stoltz strikes me as too confident, charismatic and good-looking for the role of a guy that is rudely ignored by the popular girls. This would've never happened at my school, working class or not.The movie runs 1 hour, 35 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.GRADE: B/B-",Some Kind of Wonderful
12,Mr-Fusion,"On the whole, a solid teen movie",7,2 July 2015,"Even though he didn't sit in the director's chair, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" has John Hughes' fingerprints all over it. Which is a good thing. And while everyone says this is a carbon copy of ""Pretty in Pink"" (it is), it hits the target. This movie handles issues of class division and status pretty well. True love's been under Eric Stoltz's nose the entire time, he just had to get over his infatuation with the popular girl first. And we've all been there; we've all wanted someone who was beyond our reach (especially in high school). That empathy is key here. Age is really the only catch (these actors are too old to play teenagers), but it's also a cast that features John Ashton and Elias Koteas. That's a win in my book.7/10",Some Kind of Wonderful
13,thesar-2,Perfect Title for this Film!,10,10 April 2011,"I was shocked to find out – don't ask me when, but I did realize it (possibly again) this viewing – that John Hughes did NOT direct Some Kind of Wonderful, a movie I've always labeled as my favorite John Hughes movie.Well, it still can be, thankfully. He did write it and produced it. So he did have his hands in some of the most important parts of the filmmaking process.Now, I do go up against many a Hughes fan of the 80s teen gen films because everyone's favorites always seem to be either Pretty in Pink or The Breakfast Club – both good, notwithstanding – and sometimes they even mention the excellent Ferris Bueller's Day Off. But, Some Kind of Wonderful, was just that: WONDERFUL, in every aspect. Music, acting, heart, dialogue, cast, comedy and romance. I viewed Pretty in Pink as a funny movie with a good heart – but not great. Breakfast Club was more about social commentary in the school. And Ferrisstrictly comedy with a dash of drama.It was my sister who introduced me to this movie (and Dirty Dancing) in the 1980s and I simply can't thank her enough. It made me a lifelong fan of both Eric Stolz and Mary Stuart Masterson, though it's hard to see either in many more movies. I love the soundtrack from beginning to end, and it's one of the most listened to soundtracks in my life. And the dialogue (thank you, Mr. Hughes) is so good, I've used a lot of the lines multiple times in my life. Such as: (paraphrasing) ""You can't judge a book by its coverbut you can tell how much it's gonna cost"" and ""I'm driving you crazy, and you're driving me crazy. And I'd rather not see you, and have you say good things about me, than see you and have you hate me. Cuz, I can't afford to have you hate me""Also, the romance was beautiful. Yeah, I understand the concepts in this movie are not entirely original, i.e. love triangle whereas one is completely blind to the one that loves him. But when the ""so-called secret"" is revealed, it's breathtaking. (Spoiler coming, sorry) And it doesn't hurt that the two who do get together all but walk off into the sunset (or is that moonlight?) leaving you believing this is forever. And that's my favorite type of ending where reality isn't at play. I really don't want to know what happens next. It's just enough for me to believe ""they'll make it after all.""The opposite also works here in this movie; I LOVED the beginning. What I refer to as ""Watts at Play"" is a great intro: She's playing the drums while the opening credits role and all the main characters are introduced. So well are both the drum solo by Watts (Masterson) and the first shots of the leads, that you really get a feeling of who's who and what status they play in both the high school they attend and in the movie as a hole. Brilliant.I'd like to believe the high school scenes hold up today, but its doubtful I would get others to agree with me, especially any young folk who would watch this for the first time in today's time. That's okay for several reasons: it is, in fact, based in 1987 as Watts directly points out in one scene. So, if the movie were based in a one-room school in 1865, it's a poor argument to say it doesn't hold true today. Also, I feel the themes – rebels, outcast, shy, popular, stuck up, money, disobedience, nagging parents, gossip, detention, talking backall still apply.Kids today. Whoa, let me continueKids today might be turned off by the dated nature of this film and I surely hope that doesn't happen. As I pointed out, I believe this to be as relevant today as it was 24 years ago.This is a simple movie of a boy, Keith (Stoltz) who is infatuated with taken Miss Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and is blind to the true love that's right in front of him. Also, it helps Keith's plight that Amanda's boyfriend, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer – in a role I will forever and ONLY remember him in) is a cheatin' jerk. The story gets complicated with who's using who, who's loving who and who's supposed to be saving up for college. And there's a lot of room left over for extremely funny lines, comic tensions and deep insights into real people.I do like the script and the acting is pitch-perfect, even from the secondary roles – namely from Elias Koteas as, uh, ""Skinhead."" Another role I will define him as in my mind – even though I've seen him elsewhere, such as the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film.But from all the things I loved about this film, such as the aforementioned great tunes, Watts (or Mary Stuart Masterson) is on my list of all-time favorite characters. She's tough yet insecure, hard though soft, smart but slacks, devoted however distant and both funny and sincere at the same time. She might have been overlooked for the Oscars or the casual viewer of this movie, but she steals every scene and shows the most depth of an already established fantastic cast. For someone 21 at the time, she acted her heart out and made an impact on me. Oh, and did I mention she plays a mean set of drums? I would love her in real lifeand it helps, she does kinda look like a guy.I'm going to sum up the above with: SEE IT. Don't miss one of the smaller Hughes (involved) films because everyone and their motherwait, probably mostly their motherslike Pretty in Pink more or think The Breakfast Club is superior. This 1980s relatively unknown film is a CLASSIC.",Some Kind of Wonderful
14,gbill-74877,Endearing,8,20 May 2016,"Such an endearing movie. Yes, it's predictable, and uses the time-honored romantic comedy formula of the friend who was there under one's nose all along being the 'true love' in the end (that's hardly a spoiler folks), but it's very well done, and I've always loved it.Mary Stuart Masterson and Eric Stoltz turn in sweet performances as non-conformist high school kids (her a tomboy, him an artist, both mechanics) trying to find not only love but also their paths in life. Lea Thompson is the popular girl Stoltz falls for and pursues, and turns in a strong performance as well - if you get a chance, watch her facial expressions in the scene where she slaps her rich boyfriend, played well by Craig Sheffer. But Masterson is the one to watch here: tough, funny, and incredibly pretty.John Hughes had a quite a run in the mid-late 80's, and in producing/writing this film, I consider it among his best work. What a fantastic last line, ""You look good wearing my future"", and final song, a very nice cover of ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" by English band Lick the Tins, capping off a great soundtrack. This one makes me smile.",Some Kind of Wonderful
15,g-bodyl,John Hughes Does It Again!,9,16 May 2014,"What does it seem that all teen comedies from the 80's have in common? Well, they were influenced in some way or the other by the legendary John Hughes. For this film, Some Kind of Wonderful, he penned the script. He wrote such a touching, heartfelt script and thankfully, that carried over to the final product. The film is heartfelt and earnest and is also a realistic take on high school romance. The film seems a little outdated, but if you strip away the layers, everything is the same no matter the year.Howard Deutch directed a romance film that takes a look of the high school's social hierarchy that one comes to assume. This is about some working-class kid named Keith who falls for the pretty Amanda Jones, despite her influences with the rich and popular. Meanwhile, his best friend is the tomboyish Watts who finds out she has feelings for Keith after he asks Amanda out.The acting is very good and believable. Lea Thompson is most likely the biggest star here and she does extremely well as Amanda, who tries to be with the rich and popular despite being poor. Eric Stoltz impressed me as Keith who is nice and laidback. Mary Stuart Masterson does a solid job as Watts and this is probably her best role.Overall, Some Kind of Wonderful is an 80's teen film that will keep you engaged. Despite several clichés, the film works because it has an emotional core with a strong script by Hughes and fantastic acting which makes the audience care strongly about what is going on. This is one of those films that makes me realize how great the 1980's were for film, especially with all these teen comedies. This is another great teen romance/comedy that we have all come to love. I rate this film 9/10.",Some Kind of Wonderful

17,atlasmb,Another John Hughes Classic,8,13 May 2019,"""Some Kind of Wonderful"" might best be described as a feel-good romance. Written by John Hughes, it follows his teen genre triumvirate---""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink""---as well as the teen cult favorite ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"". I remember attending its first release and being surprised that there were few viewers. Perhaps if Molly Ringwald had agreed to star, it would have found more success. Nevertheless, it has a loyal fan baseMary Stuart Masterson (""Benny & Joon"") plays the part of Watts, a tomboy with an unrequited love for her best friend, Keith, played by Eric Stoltz (""Mask""). But Keith only has eyes for Amanda Jones, played by Lea Thompson (""Howard the Duck""). Most of John Hughes' teen films are about romance and class distinctions, and this film is no exception. He places peer pressure, cultural norms and class expectations in opposition to the feelings and desires of individuals, who yearn to break free to express their inner desires.An excellent cast and generous contemporary music tracks help to make this film very enjoyable. Its ending feels like vindication. Hughes wanted to ""correct"" the ending of ""Pretty in Pink"".Watts is the nexus of the action and the center of conflict. She says ""...this is 1987. Girls can be whatever they want to be."" At the same time, what she wants most is to be loved and seen as a romantic ideal. Keith is an artist, so he sees love in tender, romantic terms. In a memorable scene, he unveils his portrait of Amanda. As seen through his eyes, she is a wistful, pensive woman. Through his love, she is transformed into a better version of herself.The film is an exposition on romantic love that both teens and adults can identify with. Though set in the superficial world of adolescents searching for acceptance, it champions eternal values that everyone can recognize.",Some Kind of Wonderful

22,hellraiser7,Wonderful Love,10,21 January 2015,"The funny think about love is that it's never entirely a matter of our choice but that it chooses us.This is an under the radar gem that wasn't entirely overlooked but it's been kinda forgotten. This was the last teen film John Hughes wrote and believe it or not this is my second favorite in that sub category from John Hughes, and it's one of my favorite romance stories. The story isn't really anything new but it's really more in it's execution in which I personally feel they got everything right. The dialog as with most of Hughes films is great, there are a lot of memorable lines but most importantly it doesn't feel melodramatic like in most bad TV teen dramas that make me gag, but really feels like the kind of things a regular teen might say. Soundtrack is great, I love the song ""Always I want to be with you.""Supporting character Amanda Jones played well by Lea Thompson this is probably my favorite role from her. I like that she doesn't play some stereotypical popular rich girl, in fact the interesting thing about her is that she's really in the same working class boat as Keith, Watts, and Duncan she just dresses up and makes herself seem like a upper class person just to get in with the in crowd.What I like is that you really feel for her character deep down she's really a lost person, we see her become disillusioned with the lifestyle from how her rich ex boyfriend Hardy mistreats her whom is a character I just want to punch. As well as how some others in that upper class treat others. These things I feel just show how just because your in the upper class doesn't mean everything is going to be wonderful or that your going to get everything.One moment that really sticks out for me was when she sees the portrait of herself that Keith painted and she then has a slight look of guilt because this portrait represents how he perceives her as a really beautiful wonderful person but she knows that she's not that person the Keith sees.Another supporting character Duccan played by Elias Koteas; his character along with his group of friends are awesome. I love the fact that he's a metal head I myself am into Heavy Metal music, a rebel, tough, rough around the edges but has a good heart all the same. Both Keith and him have a good back and forth. One scene for me that was a highlight was seeing Duncan and his friends save Keith in the party which is something real friends do.But of course the film is really driven by both the characters Keith (Eric Stolz) and Watts (Mary Stuart Matherson). Keith is great because his character is in a way kinda like myself in real life. He's a person that speaks softly, I'm not the talkative type myself; and when we talk it's because we have something significant to say. He's a artist, he loves to paint just as I love to write.Watts is just awesome and I'll admit kinda hot. She's feisty and fiery which are total turn ons for me. She a person that just likes to do her own thing and doesn't care about what other people think, from what she wears which is sort of a rocker/rebel outfit and how she acts is her way of saying, this is who I am whether you like it or not. She's also an artist as she plays the drums and likes to make her own music.I like that both really are the same in different ways, both of them are rebels. With Keith he's a silent rebel, on the passive aggressive side, he doesn't look to fight he really tries to solve conflict though reason but he will resort to physical resistance if he has to. Even like the moment in the party despite the situation getting bad where Hardy and his scum friends gang up on Keith about to give a beat down he doesn't bend. Watts is an aggressive rebel that puts it out there. I love that she's not afraid to admit to what she is. From how she dresses and the way she acts. I also love that she doesn't take crap from anyone or let Keith take crap. The chemistry between them is great, the thing about this story is that you already know the answer, the question is when. It makes perfect sense as both have more history together and are kinda the same.Watts you really feel pathos for because most of what she goes though is some of the stuff I've been though. See how she's aware that her feelings for Keith are more that just friendship alone which is perfectly natural because sometimes as times goes on if our feelings grow we begin to see our friend a lot differently. And how she's having trouble risking it all despite being a risk taker, they do say that the greatest risk is expressing your feelings. This just all the more makes us want her to do what she has to do and possibly win because it's the only way, not saying anything is even more painful.I really like how Keith is slowly discovering it, in his mind he thinks that Amanda could be the one; but we see slowly he's changing his mind a little and is starting to look at Watts differently.It has some great themes which are common in most of Hughes films like the importance of opening up to someone about how you feel, becoming more, our perception on people and how their not always what they seem, and believing in yourself.Sometimes the one we truly love is closer then we think.Rating: 4 stars",Some Kind of Wonderful
23,dee.reid,"""Some Kind of Wonderful""",7,28 April 2017,"I'll be brief here.John Hughes (1950-2009) was on a roll with his insightful teen comedies during the 1980s, peaking in 1985 with ""The Breakfast Club,"" which arguably remains his most famous work. Beginning with ""Pretty in Pink"" in 1986, Hughes was switching to primarily writing and producing duties, and letting others direct his scripts. The next film that Hughes did this with was 1987's ""Some Kind of Wonderful,"" which reunites him with ""Pink"" director Howard Deutch. ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" surrounds three high-schoolers - Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz), an aspiring artist and gas station mechanic; his best friend Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), a tomboy and wannabe punk rock drummer; and Amanda Jones (""Back to the Future"" Lea Thompson), the most popular and beautiful girl in school who also happens to be from the wrong side of the tracks - just like they are. Keith impulsively asks Amanda out on a date, which shocks their respective groups of friends and family, and Keith becomes a target of Amanda's spoiled rich-boy ex-boyfriend Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer). As Keith prepares to go out with Amanda, it soon starts to take a toll on his friendship with Watts - for reasons that aren't exactly clear at first, but become more apparent as time goes on. As many reviewers have commented before, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" is about what's going on under the surface, and how we can be blind to true love especially when it's staring right at us. As is the case with Watts - and to quote another reviewer somewhere around here - when she realizes how serious Keith is about Amanda, she puts herself ""in the line of fire,"" in spite of her protests and the fact that she appears to be the only person who really cares about Keith and his feelings. Some may be surprised about this film's conclusion, and its relationships, and how it appears to be the reverse of what we saw in ""Pretty in Pink."" ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" isn't exactly one of John Hughes's best works, but it has plenty of feelings, humor, and raw emotional honesty - all of which are hallmarks of Hughes's best works. Sometimes, that's all that's really needed in a film like this.7/10",Some Kind of Wonderful
24,drqshadow-reviews,"A Soft, Hollow, Redundant Conclusion to the Hughes Teen Years",4,18 July 2016,"Last of the John Hughes teen movies, and it's pretty clear that he'd already said everything he had to say. Thematically similar to Pretty in Pink, Hughes's preceding collaboration with director Howard Deutch, Wonderful isn't half as charming in either script or performance. It's a wishy-washy, often boring take on the same old ""us versus them"" concept, wrapped up in the hopeless chase of the school beauty. Age has been a stretch for these films before (Judd Nelson and Emilio Estevez were in their mid-20's for The Breakfast Club) but the acting has always been good enough to make us forget. This time, without any of the Brat Pack regulars, there's something missing; it constantly feels like adult stars forced into adolescent roles. Lea Thompson seems like she's on her way to interview for a news broadcasting gig, and approximately 75% of the school wears shoulder pads of one variety or another. None of it feels authentic. The performances are almost universally hollow and vacant, too, especially from leading man Eric Stolz, who looks and acts like a mannequin. It has a few redeeming moments, particularly a shining small part for Elias Koteas as a punk rock musclehead, and a good message, but otherwise it's passionless fodder. I guess all good things must come to an end.",Some Kind of Wonderful
25,Fluke_Skywalker,Aptly titled,7,13 May 2017,"Plot; A high school senior pursues a beautiful classmate while oblivious to his female best friend's romantic interest in him.What could be called a Pretty in Pink rehash by writer John Hughes and director Howard Deutch actually plays more like a do over to me. Hughes was reportedly unhappy with the ultimate theatrical ending to Pretty in Pink, which came about because the original ending (with Molly Ringwald's character choosing her quirky best friend Duckie at the end) was poorly received by test audiences (ironically today many fans champion Duckie as the one Ringwald's Andie should have chosen). Here he switches up the genders, but keeps much of the basic plot in tact. Lead character Keith (Eric Stoltz) is a blue collar kid who falls for the beautiful and popular Amanda (Lea Thompson), herself a working class girl who has risen to her perch amongst the school's elite thanks to her looks and rich boyfriend, Hardy (played loathsomely by Craig Sheffer). The Duckie here is the tomboyish Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), and right from the start I was rooting for Watts over Amanda. That's not because Amanda is a bad person (more on this in a sec), but because it's so crystal clear to everyone but Keith that he and Watts are made for each other (I also happened to fall head over heels for Mary Stuart Masterson here ).I've always loved Pretty in Pink, but in some ways I have to say Some Kind of Wonderful is an improvement. The former has a much stronger soundtrack (making excellent use of post-punk New Wave pop), and Ringwald makes for a more compelling lead than the somewhat stiff Stoltz, but Watts is a more sympathetic character than her Pretty in Pink counterpart (at least to me) and Sheffer makes for a far more boo-worthy villain than James Spader. What undermines things a bit is the ending. Yeah, Keith and Watts end up together, but it lacks not only the iconic panache of Pink, Keith's fourth quarter revelation that he has romantic feelings for Watts (after the ever likable and cheerworthy Amanda decides she needs to take some time for her self) feels too sudden. You've got to earn that moment, and they don't here. But overall I think Some Kind of Wonderful is a worthy and overlooked part of Hughes' classic 80s catalog.",Some Kind of Wonderful
26,jfgibson73,Great Movie,7,4 March 2017,"I enjoyed this movie all the way through. The way the main character behaved is the way I wish I could have acted as a teenager--he has confidence, knows what he wants, and stays true to himself, never pretending to be something he's not. I don't know how realistic a portrayal of a teenager it was, but I like to imagine what it would have been like if I could have handled things that way. Keith asks out a popular girl out, and the movie centers around their upcoming date-- kind of the way Pretty In Pink built up to the prom. If I'm going to compare the two, I think Pretty in Pink is a more complete story, but Some Kind Of Wonderful has it's own merits. I was happy to discover it, and I wish it was more well known.",Some Kind of Wonderful
27,gcd70,Some Kind of Entertainment,5,5 January 2008,"John Hughes, the undisputed king of teen drama and comedy, brings us yet another typical high school piece about a young man who attempts to win the affections of a popular and wealthy girl whilst his best friend, a tom-boy who is in love with him, does her utmost to dissuade him of his intentions.Writer Hughes teams with director Deutch (the two are no strangers - ""The Great Outdoors"" being another project they both worked on) for a film which once again shows the insight that Hughes has into the psyche of the young adult. Unfortunately he fails to turn ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" into the accurately reflective movie that his very successful 1984 smash ""The Breakfast Club"" was.A narrow and predictable plot certainly does not help, as the audience is never in doubt about the outcome. Couple this with shallow characters who fail to give the show any depth, and you have a slightly disappointing teen flick. Acting performances aren't really high grade either, with Eric Stoltz having been much better in ""Mask"", Mary Stuart Masterson since rising to greater heights (""Fried Green Tomatoes"") and even Lea Thompson, you feel, could improve.Overall Deutch Hughes and co. do manage some kind of entertainment, but even if you can become interested in the people involved, you could hardly call it ""Some Kind of Wonderful"".Saturday, June 11, 1994 - Video",Some Kind of Wonderful
28,a_chinn,Pretty in Pink with a different ending (but in a good way),8,14 July 2017,"This was the only John Hughes film from his 80s heyday that I had not seen back in the day. I remember seeing the previews for this and when Mary Stuart Masterson says, ""The only things I care about in this goddamn life are me and my drums and you"" I scoffed and wrote the film off. I shouldn't have because this was a very endearing and sincere teen drama. The film is a love triangle between working class Eric Stoltz, who is crushing on rich girl Lea Thompson, who's also best friends will fellow working class tomboy Mary Stuart Masterson, who is also crushing on Stoltz. What made this film more interesting than most is how the relationships play out. Thompson only agrees to go on a date with Stoltz as a way to get back at her jerk rich boyfriend, Craig Sheffer, who she just broke up with. None of Thompson's friends think she should go out with Stoltz, and all of the other kids, including Masterson, tell Stoltz she's only going out with him to get back at her ex-boyfriend. Thompson (SPOILER ALERT) never seems interested in Stoltz and I think that's where this film get a bit more interesting than most, taking a less obvious of standard love triangle. There is a bit of suspense whether Thompson will actually start to like Stoltz the way he likes her, but the main drama is whether Stoltz will realize that he should be with Masterson. I wasn't really sure how this film was going to play out, which is always good for a film. Hughes' ""Pretty in Pink"" has the rich boy casting aside the aspersions of his snooty friends to end up with the cute working class girl. That film's original script was supposed to have had a different ending, with Molly Ringwald ending up with Ducky, but that ending was re-shot after test audiences didn't it (Cryer was clearly playing Ducky as gay, so there was never really any real romantic tension there, so the change was the right choice). This film retains Pretty in Pink's original ending, which may have been the impetus for re-writing what is essentially the same class conflict love triangle. Another strength of this film is it's strong supporting cast, which includes the sadly underused John Ashton as Stoltz' gruff but understanding father and Elias Koteas looking very young as a punk rock bad boy who helps out Stoltz, which is a hoot to watch. And look for a very young Candace Cameron as one of Stoltz' younger sisters. Overall, when it comes to class warfare love triangles, this film is certainly not ""A Place in the Sun"" and although it is not as iconic as ""Pretty in Pink,"" it does feature strong performances by the three leads, well rounded characters you believe and care about, and a very realistic and identifiable love story. All around, this is a solid 1980s teen drama that deserves to be remembered alongside ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Pretty in Pink.""",Some Kind of Wonderful
29,triple8,For anyone who has ever fallen in love with their best friend.,9,4 February 2004,"What's great about this offbeat little teen gem from the 80's is the whole ""falling in love"" with your friend thing. The friendship between Keith and Drummer Girl is refreshing and fun and the whole character development of these two plus Amanda, the ultimate ""it girl""-who may not be quite as content as one thinks-is great. I loved this book back in ""the day"" and the movie is great too. Anyone who's been young, crazy and had a close friendship that became a bit more will relate. In addition this movie takes on the whole ""identity, conformity"" thing as well-and it does it with style.Mary Stuart Masterson plays the tough girl with a heart of gold: Drummer Girl and I am not exaggerating when I say she creates one of the sassiest, most lovable and completely unforgettable females I've ever seen on the big screen. Academy award worthy, I'm not kidding.In fact, all these characters shine brightly and kudos to the performers and creators for a great teen comedy-one of the best, and one that I still watch years later, as I now have added the movie to my collection . Some kind of wonderful is truly so under rated. This flick is sort of a teenage ""when harry met sally""(bohemien style) meets ""revenge of the nerds""-bohemien syle meets a bit of ""pretty in pink""and ""The Breakfast club"". At the same time it's got it's own unique quality and style to it as well. I would give this an 8.5 or 9.

30,eric262003,An 80's Movie That One Must See,8,31 August 2009,"The success of 1980's teen comedies was successful, thanks mostly to the success of the genius of the late great John Hughes. Hughes was in many ways the 1980's version of King Midas. Whatever teen comedy he was involved with the results was genuine gold. Every angst that was faced involving youth in the 1980's, Hughes knew the right key to give his audience full attention to what's going on and hope that the subliminal messages delivered to his films are easy to grasp at. It's sad that a man like John Hughes is no longer with us because he knew how to comprehend with teens, which others had tried, but didn't quite live up to the legacy of John Hughes.What makes ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" a special movie is that from the beginning of the story, we get a full satisfying glimpse of the characters without wasting a single moment at grabbing our attention. From Watts' (Mary Stuart Masterson) opening scene with her drumming, to Amanda (Lea Thompson) in a smooch fest with Hardy Jenns (Craig Shaffer), to introverted Keith Nelson (Eric Stoltz)dropping oil into a car. Those simple scenes are symbolic in a way to explain what faction each of these students belong to.Watts hangs out with Keith quite frequently. When Watts is not on her drum kit and when Keith's off work at the car shop, they're seen spending quality time talking casually. Keith and Watts join together in the loner's club. They're not from the upper realms of the crop. In fact if school was built like a layer cake, they would be at the bottom of the surface. Watts is a tomboy who's often condemned by her peers most to her boyish apparel. And Keith gets condemned mostly because of is job as an artist. In one of Keith and Watts' casual chats, Keith reveals that he is smitten over a classmate, Amanda. Watts has a total dislike for Amanda. Like Keith and Watts, Amanda is also from a poor family, but unlike Watts and Keith, she's the whipped topping among her classmates. Mostly because she's dating the rich, suave and smooth-talking teen Hardy. One day, after a bitter spat between Amanda and Hardy, Amanda breaks up with Hardy and was quick to respond to Keith when he asked her to go out. While Keith excitedly dresses up for his dream date, Amanda is at a crossroads; she can't seem to find the right way to tell Keith that she's not really interested in dating him because she doesn't want to bring herself down to the same layer as them.If school's not a problem for Keith, home is also quite trivial as well. His father has no other cares in the world except for his son continuing his education and keeping track of his college tuition. But Keith just wants to continue his studies in art which doesn't sit well with his father. This is the second film, Hughes and director Howard Deutch collaborated on (The first was ""Pretty in Pink""). Many have claimed that there both very similar to each other. Though, they're mostly right with the exception of the ending to ""Pretty in Pink"", it would have been the exact same movie. I always liked how John Hughes utilized music to connect the feelings of each of his characters. It's still in the traditional 1980's style flare, and who can forget the song Miss Amanda Jones by the March Violets.Eric Stoltz was simply amazing here as poor boy Keith Nelson, by making his role very real without being too preachy. The chemistry between him and the other two female stars will grab your attention at a tight focus. The one-liners by these characters will leave you in stitches in laughter. Even though you've left us too soon Mr. Hughes, your films, stories and humour will live on forever and for that reason alone we salute you John Hughes. There will never be another person like you.",Some Kind of Wonderful

33,CitizenCaine,Hughes Lets Deutch Direct Pretty In Pink Retread,6,6 June 2009,"OK, Some Kind Of Wonderful is the title of a Grand Funk Railroad song, and its lyrics do sort of drum up the theme from the film: the idea that the best one for you doesn't necessarily require all kinds of unnecessary effort and fancy gimmicks. John Hughes wrote and produced the film about teenagers who are probably closer to real life than in most other films. Eric Stoltz is Kevin, a guy who thinks the ultimate girl is the most popular and best looking. Well isn't it? I guess boobs like me need movies like this to tell us we're wrong. Lea Thompson, everyone's it girl in the mid 1980's, is Amanda, the ideal girl. She plays it perfectly with a sense of vulnerability not often seen in her role. Mary Stuart Masterson is Watts, a drummer who can't convince Kevin what a dope he is for going after Amanda. Craig Sheffer is the obnoxious boyfriend of Amanda's who turns the audience off long before Amanda. The supporting cast is terrific, as in most of Hughes-penned films.However, there are a few elements in the film that are disappointing. The first is Kevin blowing his college money on the big night. Kevin may not be that socially astute, but guys like him are not completely foolish when it comes to their own interests. Second, Masterson is not really that appealing, although she's a very good actress in this film. Short hair, like hers, was not attractive in 1987, even though she was a tomboy. Third, I don't buy the ending, but undoubtedly the ending is exactly why many people, especially women, will fondly recall the film as so romantic. Fourth, guys never seem to make their own choices when appearing in films like this. Destiny plays too much of a role for my taste maybe.The Grand Funk Railroad song does not appear in the film, which makes one wonder why the reference to begin with? Amanda Jones, of course, is a Rolling Stones' song, Watts is the last name of the drummer in the Rolling Stones, and Keith is, well you know, Keith. No Mick in here though. The soundtrack is filled with plentiful songs that go well with many scenes, as is the case in John Hughes' films. The film starts out OK, gets better as it goes along, peaks on the big night with Kevin and Amanda, and comes crashing to a disappointing halt at the end. It just doesn't ring true, and most viewers will figure out exactly how this will end. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Some Kind of Wonderful
34,gab-14712,Well-Developed Characters Elevate An Average Story!,8,6 October 2020,"1987's Some Kind of Wonderful is pure, golden John Hughes. It is yet another story focused in a high-school setting that delivers a message about the pains of growing up. If the plot sounds recycled (and it basically is), Hughes once again elevates a standard coming-of-age story thanks to his empathetic screenplay that developed realistic, three-dimensional characters. This film is not exactly about if the hero of the story gets the woman of his dreams, but rather it asks the question, should he get the girl of his dreams. And once again, I am amazed how accurate Hughes is able to grasp high-school life especially in areas concerning relationships.
If the plot of this movie sounds familiar, I bet you are thinking about 1986's Pretty in Pink which was another working collaboration between producer/writer Hughes and director Howard Deutch. While I thought that particular movie was your fun, typical Hughes drama, the film made headlines because of its ending. The best friend falls in love with the female lead, but she ignores him in the end, and that created plenty of backlash. It even caused a falling out between Deutch and Hughes. In response, Hughes wrote a very similar story but swapped genders. This time, he wanted to be sure the audience gets what they want. In retrospect, he made an intelligent move because this film's ending is more satisfying, sweet, and even somewhat emotional.
The story itself is standard and nothing surprises you. Keith (Eric Stoltz) is a high-school student who works as a mechanic and has a thing for the arts. He is an outsider at school. His best friend is a tomboy named Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), likewise an outsider and a pretty darn good drums player. Keith has his eyes on the most beautiful girl in his school, Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson). After she breaks up with her rich boyfriend, Keith decides to make his move. Surprisingly, she accepts his advances. Now to make sure everything works, Keith asks Watts to help him understand the female brain. As the story progresses, Watts begins to search herself and her true feelings begin to surface.
If you are familiar with films from John Hughes, you may be wondering where on earth is Molly Ringwald? She turned down the role of Watts to focus on more adult roles which ended her working relationship with Hughes as he took it very personally. That said, Mary Stuart Masterson was a very strong substitute and may have been the film's best performance. Her character is strong and relatable. A very well-written, capable female performance. Eric Stoltz is able to match up with her performance as the two exhibited some excellent chemistry. I liked John Ashton as Keith's father. Usually, Hughes makes his adult characters dumb, but he surprisingly makes Ashton's character sympathetic. He wants his kid to go to college, but Keith wants to lead his own life and do something with the arts. Hmmmm sounds quite personal to me.
Overall, Some Kind of Wonderful is your typical John Hughes movie; a basic story that works because of its three-dimensional, well-developed characters. Even Lea Thompson's Amanda Jones is not your prototypical dumb beauty. I am amused by Hughes's inside joke about The Rolling Stones (Keith, Watts, Amanda Jones...I hope you know what I mean). Also, a shoutout to Keith's sister played by Maddie Corman. She is riotously hilarious. And no, that skinhead is not Robert De Niro. That is Elias Koteas. Anyway, this is an underrated film that should be seen. Great characters, great soundtrack, great emotional ending (loved the chauffeur bit with Watts), and average story

36,Superunknovvn,"The superior version of ""Pretty In Pink""",6,8 May 2006,"Director Howard Deutch and John Hughes reunited one year after their previous joint venture ""Pretty In Pink"" to make ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"", which is essentially the same movie as the Molly Ringwald vehicle. The only difference is that this time it's a boy who's torn between two girls, one of which is his best friend and the other being the popular high school queen. Although this is still a fairy tale in which characters act like they never would in real life, ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" is the more successful of the two movies. The pacing is tighter, the characters are less sappy, the acting is far superior and most importantly, the ending is more satisfying (if not exactly believable). Besides, it's nice to see Lea Thompson and Eric Stoltz interact, since they had already both been cast in ""Back To The Future"" before Stoltz was thrown out for creative differences with director Robert Zemeckis. They're working real well as a couple in this movie. All in all ""Some Kind Of Wonderful"" is the bettered version of ""Pretty In Pink"".",Some Kind of Wonderful

38,DavidSim240183,One of John Hughes' more underrated teen films,9,18 September 2007,"Some Kind of Wonderful is one of John Hughes' lesser known teen films. Made in 1987, it turned out to be his last association with the teen genre before moving on to other areas of interest. Its a film that's never achieved the classic status of Hughes' other films of the time like Ferris Bueller's Day Off or The Breakfast Club. Even though I found it to be just as entertaining, and even rewarding.If you've ever seen Pretty in Pink, made the year previously, then you will notice some astonishing similarities. They both focus on a teenage love triangle. A high school misfit falls for a popular Senior while off to the side, a rebel who's friends with the misfit pines for them from afar. The only thing that differs is the ending. In PIP, misfit and popular Senior end up together. In SKOW, misfit ends up with rebel.Both films were written by John Hughes, and I think with SKOW, he got to make the film he originally envisioned. Hughes was allegedly unhappy with the way PIP ended. It was an ending that was forced upon him by the studio. I must admit I never really cared all that much for Pretty in Pink. The characters just weren't that interesting. Some Kind of Wonderful on the other hand is everything that film wasn't.The difference I think is all in the casting. Eric Stoltz offers a quiet but solid assessment of the part of Keith, the struggling artist who doesn't quite fit in at school. Lea Thompson plays with strength and depth as Amanda, the Prom Princess with issues of her own. And best of all is Mary Stewart Masterson as Watts, the non-conformist who longs for Keith in silence.Nobody quite makes a teen film like John Hughes. He has this ability to take generic material and infuse it with surprising depth and intelligence. And humour value too. When he moved on to adult films, he seemed quite out of his element. Probably because he seems a little awkward when trying to write them as anything other than stereotypes. The one exception was Planes, Trains & Automobiles, but that was down to the superbly nuanced acting of Steve Martin and especially John Candy.The adults in Hughes' teen films usually come off as alien, distant and uncomprehending of their children. Some Kind of Wonderful may be the one time where he gets that area right.Keith's father Cliff (John Ashton) wants his son to go off to college. I like the way he puts his point across:""You could go on to a job where you don't have to wash your hands after a hard day's work.""Keith would rather become an artist than have his life mapped out for him by his father. And when I saw SKOW the first time, I was expecting Hughes to fumble it, and turn Cliff into an indifferent monster. But I was surprised by Keith and Cliff's confrontation. Their heart-to-heart is quite well written on Hughes' part, and he allows both characters ample room to breathe. Cliff may be the closest thing to a sympathetic adult in a Hughes teen film.But its the young cast that make all the right moves. The central love triangle could be viewed as predictable, but the acting goes some way towards making Some Kind of Wonderful more entertaining than it has a right to be.Amanda could be regarded as a popular Ms Chic right at the top of the high school tree. And granted she only gets involved with Keith as a spur of the moment thing to spite her ex, but there are some depths to her character. She admits she makes bad decisions from time to time. But she would rather be with a gaggle of popular schoolgirls instead of feeling lonely all the time.But Watts is the one character to tune into. Mary Stewart Masterson does a great job fleshing out what's already a well written character. Her silent love for Keith is touching, and she's a walking voice of wisdom. Her curse is to see everything as it really is. She's so astute that its no wonder she's so alienated from everyone else around her at high school. Hughes may have trouble writing adult characters, but as for teenagers he's got them nailed.And there's a nice line of supporting characters too. I especially liked Laura, Keith's younger sister, played by Maddie Corman. Like Watts, she's astute and attuned to the world around her in ways most pre-teens only dream of. And I also liked Duncan, played by Elias Koteas. At first glance he seems a punk from detention, but becomes a surprisingly valued ally to Keith. Its all the more satisfying because I never saw it coming.Keith and Amanda's relationship hits a few bumps along the road. Too many as it turns out. Something that gets pointed out to them frequently. The ending is not all that unexpected, and it does come a little too abruptly, but I really enjoyed Some Kind of Wonderful. Its got a great cast of young actors and hits a lot of the right notes. It doesn't deserve obscurity. Its just as good as any of John Hughes' other teen films.A fine piece of work from a man who turned out some of the best teen movies the world had ever seen.",Some Kind of Wonderful

When I first flipped it over, I though to myself, ""What is THIS? The L Word or something? A chicks only type of movie???"" At first glance, I thought it was 3 ""manly"" looking women, until I gave it a minute to sink in, and saw that Eric Stoltz was a man, a pretty good looking one at the time, and that this was a John Hughes movie! Then my girlfriend added, ""That's my favorite movie of all time!"". I was interested...Movie kicks off to a great start immediately with a sweet new wave song over Mary Mastersen rocking out on her drums with a big heart on her snare head! You can already tell this movie is going to be pretty serious, and some sort of a period piece. And it is! Eric Stoltz character introduction is amazing...walking right up to a train, playing chicken on his own, and you can tell he is 100% not scared or threatened. He casually walks to the side of it just before it hits him, what a daring soul! Lea Thompson does her job, accurately, as the popular girl who wants to give this random nobody kid a chance because her last boyfriend was terrible to her. And by the way, Lea Thompson's super 80's suave ken doll of a boyfriend is one of the best characters in the movie! He is a d-bag to the extreme! The only other character who matches him in awesomeness is DUNCAN, the rebel punk rocker of the school, spending every day in detention, played by whoever that dude is that plays CASEY JONES in the Ninja Turtles movie! I'm sorry I'm talking about the characters so much but this movie is ALL in the characters. Mary Stuart as WATTS is the most adorable character in the movie! I haven't seen many people pull off the ""teen angst""y, super-critical, talk crap about everyone personality like she does! It's so believable but it's so cute! And when she's sad you'll want to cry with her like a puppy.Solid direction and soundtrack. Plenty of interesting plot twists and turns to keep you intensely excited. And like i said, AMAZING characters! You even get to see Candace Cameron at about age 6 as the bookworm little sister! She's so smart. Definitely check this out if you like John Hughes, love stories, teen dramas, 80's era stuff, or if you just like straight up good movies!",Some Kind of Wonderful

42,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Underrated Teen Classic From John Hughes.",10,3 June 2015,"Some Kind Of Wonderful is an excellent,underrated Teen classic that combines great direction,a wonderful cast,a fantastic script and a memorable score and soundtrack. All of those elements make Some Kind Of Wonderful a great film that is John Hughes at his best.Some Kind Of Wonderful tells the story of Keith(Eric Stolz),a High School teenager who is a gas station employee and painter and has romantic feelings for Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson),a popular girl who goes out with her rich boyfriend Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). With courage by his side Keith asks Amanda out on a date which doesn't sit well with Keith's tomboy best friend Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson)who starts to have feelings for Keith. Now,Keith has to deal with his friendship with Watts and his attraction to Amanda.Released in 1987,Some Kind Of Wonderful is a terrific and memorable Teen movie that was writer John Hughes' final film in the Teen/High School/Coming Of Age genre and maybe his most overlooked of the Teen movies he did from 1984 to 87 and is a movie that came out towards the end of the teen movie boom of the 1980s because by 1987 the Teen genre by 1987 and John Hughes' association with the genre had hit it's creative peak. Often seen as a gender reversed remake of earlier Teen classic Pretty In Pink(1986)and some will admit there is similarities between the two films(the same director and writer,love triangle,soundtracks and even the movie posters). At the same time there are minor differences between the two movies. And while Pretty In Pink is a great movie and a more iconic and well-known film I always preferred Some Kind Of Wonderful a movie that may not be very original but is one of the best Teen films of the 80s. Some Kind Of Wonderful is in my opinion not only a John Hughes classic but a Teen classic as well but unfortunately is often underrated and overlooked in comparison to The Breakfast Club,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,Sixteen Candles,Pretty In Pink and Weird Science which is a shame because SKOW has all of the trademarks of those other films:memorable characters,great soundtrack and good dialog where everything just works. While none of the John Hughes regulars such as Molly Ringwald or Anthony Michael Hall appear in SKOW the Hughes style is still in effect with this movie. In SKOW we get some romance,drama and a little humor in the way Hughes did so well and the movie keeps your attention. The whole movie is basically a build-up to the last half hour of the film when Keith and Amanda go out on their date and what happens before that examining the relationships of the three main characters Keith,Watts and Amanda who in true John Hughes fashion are three dimensional characters and have depth. With Keith,Watts and Amanda we as a viewer have a connection with all of them as the three of them have to deal with love,relationships and dealing with their peers and classmates. As Hughes did with The Breakfast Club and Pretty In Pink SKOW deals with timeless themes and issues such as identity,different social groups as well as class struggle with rich vs poor among teenagers. The screenplay by John Hughes is terrific with memorable dialog that is strong,amazing and just makes the characters real and unforgettable. The ending of Some Kind Of Wonderful is amazing and classic John Hughes and is a truly effective and romantic and will viewers cheering at the screen. A fantastic ending.The cast is great. Eric Stolz is excellent as Keith,with Stolz bringing an emotional weight and depth to the role. Mary Stuart Masterson is brilliant,beautiful and gives the film's best performance as Watts,with Masterson being powerful and stealing every scene she's in. Lea Thompson is terrific and beautiful as Amanda,with Thompson being dramatic in the right places. Craig Sheffer is great as Hardy Jenns,Amanda's rich jerk boyfriend. John Ashton is wonderful as Cliff Nelson,Keith's Father. Elias Koteas is fantastic and funny as Duncan,a teenage punk. Maddie Corman(Laura Nelson),Molly Hagan(Shayne),Scott Coffey(Ray)and Lee Garlington(Gym Instructor)give good performances as well.The direction by Howard Deutch is simple,but great and effective,with Deutch sometimes moving the camera and bringing a nice pace and style to the film. Fine direction,Deutch.The score by Stephen Hague and John Musser is impressive,great and fits with the tone of the movie. Good score,Hague and Musser. There is also a soundtrack with some fantastic Pop/Rock songs that add to the film. A great soundtrack.In final word,if you love John Hughes or Teen Films,I highly suggest you see Some Kind Of Wonderful,an excellent,underrated Teen classic that is John Hughes at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Some Kind of Wonderful
43,flicklover,Underrated in the John Hughes teen movie collection.,8,25 June 2004,"I was a teenager in the 80's. The whole John Hughes collection of teen comedies are classics of the time. They all were funny, insightful, but never false or preachy. I think that is what made them so appealing. This film had the misfortune of coming after Pretty in Pink, and yes has virtually the same plot. Rich snobby kids vs. average income kids. An outsider played by Eric Stotlz plays an outsider that Falls for a girl that is part of the Rich kid click, and of course she has a snob, rich obnoxious boyfriend that wants to beat him up.... Hughes movies were never great on plot, he took basic somewhat clichéd stories and made them fresh with good dialog and engaging actors. Stoltz gives a subtle intelligent performance, and Lea Thompson plays the snobby girl, but she is given the chance to be 3 dimensional, her performance is good. The movie truly belongs to Mary Stuart Masterson, she plays Stolz's best friend and confidant, and yes like Jon Cryer's character (duckie) in Pretty in Pink, she is in love with her best friend.She plays the character with the right mix of attitude and sensibility. The Duckie character in the other movie, was used more as comic relief. Masterson's character is more part of the story, and she makes the movie better because of it. This movie is entertaining because the characters are thoughtful and intelligent. It may not be a masterpiece, but it is an entertaining teen movie, and the soundtrack is great!!!Grade: B",Some Kind of Wonderful

This movie shows us how to stand up to the bullies. I loved it! I'm a Mary Stuart Masterson fan, ever since she played in 'Chances Are', one of my faves. She played really great 'innocence' in both these movies, and that's the sort of charm I like about these two movies with her in them. Eric Stoltz has played in a lot of movies, but I cannot remember him in anything else that I have seen (and there are many of his movies I haven't seen yet). So far, this is the one that will stick with me. To me, this movie was about how to stick up for yourself when it comes to bullies. It's worthy of your viewing! Enjoy!",Some Kind of Wonderful
46,Meredith-7,"Different, but really enjoyable",8,19 July 1999,"This film is like a reversed Pretty in Pink, and it works really well.  All three leads were excellent, especially Masterson as the Tomboy who falls in love with Stoltz.  The storyline is different from many other films of the genre as it attempts to be more realistic in its depiction of not only teenage life, but the problems that face the families and the teenagers in regards to future ambitions and social standings.  Where the other Hughes films before this tended to skim the surface of these issues, this film takes a deep plunge right into these issues, and works immensely well because of it.  The only problem is the leads were probably getting a little old to play teenagers completely convincingly.",Some Kind of Wonderful
47,matija-trost,A FINE MID-EIGHTIES TEEN MOVIE...,6,24 November 2001,"... to watch on a sunday afternoon, as one of the critics wrote before me. And I certainly agree. The plot is already seen, but here's a nice acting by all three leading actors (especially by Lea Thompson a.k.a. Amanda). And although you could guess the ending, it's an enjoyable watch all the way. It's one of these movies, who takes you back to the eighties, when the search for identity was as same as today. 
Maybe it's just my nostalgia, but i decided to rate this movie a solid6 out of 10",Some Kind of Wonderful
48,neenahhh,"One of the best teen movies ever made, you say?",5,24 March 2011,"I saw one site giving this movie a high recommendation as one of the best high school movies that were ever made. I decided to research the movie here on IMDb and saw mostly good praise. The rating was average, but I was bored, so I thought, ""Oh, what the hell. Might as well give it a try!"" Plus the summary seemed interesting and invited me in.'A young tomboy, Watts, finds her feelings for her best friend, Keith, run deeper than just friendship when he gets a date with the most popular girl in school.' The summary makes it seem like the movie would be from Watts' point of view, but it wasn't. We only see glimpses of her 'agonizing' face every now and then when Keith's with Amanda. I was disappointed, since I was looking forward to see the whole movie from the ""tomboy's perspective"". Instead, the movie focuses on Keith, which I wasn't very fond of. I think that I would have liked this movie more if it was focusing more on Watts.I didn't like the ending. (SPOILERS) I mean, when did Keith even realize that he liked Watts? It was too rushed! There wasn't enough development! Except for the hot little practice kiss they shared and that bar moment. Mhm. (/SPOILERS)I also didn't like the whole message that this movie gave. (SPOILERS) Keith used all the money that he and his father saved up for his future- his college!- for a pair of earrings for some girl. I mean, I found that pretty stupid. I'm not a love hater or anything, but seriously, I know the limits. (/SPOILERS)I'm aware that this is a pretty old film and many people find it popular, but this just wasn't my type. If you're like me, who is kind of cynical and doesn't necessarily believe that you MUST give up everything for love, then maybe you won't enjoy it that much either. But if you feel like giving it a try, then go on. The practice kiss that Watts and Keith shared was well worth the watch, anyway.",Some Kind of Wonderful
49,cnycitylady,"John Hughes falls short of character, but still creates a gem",8,20 March 2013,"Some Kind of Wonderful was written and produced by John Hughes, the man who most people call the 80s king. His teen based movies did very well with audiences of all ages and are still hailed as some of the best movies of that decade. But then you get this movie, which by all accounts should be excellent, but when you look at the trite storyline and shallow characters you think ""John Hughes wrote this?""Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 7/10 because, for some reason or other, this movie, with all of its unoriginality and basically second rate story, captures your attention and you find yourself watching it over and over again. The character Watts was perhaps the only refreshing thing in the film. Her blatant disdain for her friend Keith's interest in a preppy girl isn't subtle and isn't annoying. She lets him know that she doesn't approve with her snide comments and concerns for him. I like to think it's her way of alerting her somewhat oblivious friends to her feelings for him. Mary Stuart Masterson did an impeccable job as the sexy tomboy best friend.Keith's character, although cute in his naive and unsure manner, isn't as likable as Watts; But this is masterfully done because you feel that his character shouldn't be as cool as Watts. You see in him purity of mind and heart and you know that without his best friend he wouldn't get very far in life before someone or something rocks his world, (and not in a good way.) All of these characters at first seem shallow and underdeveloped, but as you watch you realize that that is part of the movie's charm. You don't know everything about these characters because you are only glimpsing a week in the life of these kids, and they aren't spilling their guts and innermost feelings to you like in ""The Breakfast Club"" and they don't pine and long for someone they know they cannot have such as the characters in ""Pretty in Pink"" and ""Sixteen Candles."" They try to attain what their hearts want the most, but the two go about it differently. By the end of this movie you're smiling (Not at the abrupt ending where Keith realizes who he really loves) but at the fact that you know that this here is another classic and you think, ""Yes, this is John Hughes.""",Some Kind of Wonderful
50,DeuceWild_77,"A ""Pretty in Pink"" done right, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" shines above the other 80's teen flicks, even with its recycled material.",9,25 May 2020,"""Some Kind of Wonderful"" was conceived like a more dark ""Pretty in Pink"" and, at the same time, making things right, because John Hughes never liked the ending of his own written cult teen film, changed at the 11th hour by the studio executives, featuring Andrew McCarthy looking gaunt and in a fake wig and Molly Ringwald coming together, leaving the fan's favorite, Jon Cryer's Duckie, out in a limbo of his own sexual ambiguity.Focused on directing ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" ('87), like the year before with ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" ('86), Hughes gave in once again the director chair to Howard Deutch, staying as the writer and producer, making a more realistic, emotionally deeper and offbeat version of ""Pretty in Pink"", being less corny and cheesy and more sophisticated and matured, even if it features the inevitable teens, played by twenty-something years old actors, as usual in the movies involving John Hughes.Hughes and Deutch decision of leaving ""The Brat Pack"" members out of this picture, opting to cast indie actors, was an interesting move that enhanced the story content and the realistic tone of the characters, all of them in a grey zone through the film, in which nothing is what it seems.
The 'girl next door' Molly Ringwald refused to be in, ending her successful collaboration with Hughes (""Sixteen Candles"", ""The Breakfast Club"", ""Pretty in Pink""), but glad she did that, because she wouldn't fit to this movie's atmosphere.Eric Stoltz, the Rocky Dennis from ""Mask"" ('85) and the original Marty McFly from ""Back to the Future"" ('85), before he was fired by Spielberg and Zemeckis due to ""acting too adult"", was a perfect choice to the character of Keith Nelson, a blue collar mechanic in his spare time, which is also a sensitive painter and a socially shy teenager being a misfit in a strict social hierarchy in this Los Angeles' suburban High School.
His best friend, Susan Watts (a marvellous and captivating performance by Mary Stuart Masterson, which deserved to be Oscar Nominated in a Supporting Role) is a tomboy-ish drummer that loves Keith secretely and is relutantly helping him to gain the heart of the beautiful and popular, Amanda Jones (the always adorable Lea Thompson, which was recommended for the role by Stoltz after they temporarily played mother and son in the aforementioned, ""Back to the Future""), girlfriend to the handsome snobbish and bad-tempered, Hardy Jenns (Craig Sheffer, in a role that he could do in his sleep).The prolific character actor, John Ashton (""Beverly Hills Cop I & II"", ""Midnight Run"") appears as Cliff Nelson, Keith's stubborn Dad and Maddie Corman as his annoying younger sister.
An early role for Elias Koteas playing Duncan, a vicious looking punk, that in fact is more likeable than the hot rich kid in school.
His acting is good, comical in parts and leaves a mark, but doesn't belong in the tone of this film, it's more suitable for a dark humor teen comedy such as ""Three O'Clock High"" (also released in '87).This kind of love triangle may be similar to ""Pretty in Pink"", but it was so heartfelt performed by the main trio, helped by an inspiring and stylished direction, some great written lines and a suitable moody photography, which made this movie a standout among the other teen films released in the 80's.
Even the soundtrack is more alternative than the previous John Hughes' films, featuring tracks from Pete Shelley (Buzzcocks); Flesh for Lulu; Furniture; Lick the Tins; Charlie Sexton; Stephen Duffy (Duran Duran); The Apartments or The Jesus and Mary Chain.Among the most memorable scenes, the training kiss between Keith and Watts, beautiful, intimate and awkward at the same time and a spark of how great actress Mary Stuart Masterson is, and Lea Thompson's emotional crying scene at the end.In short, all the elements from a Hughes' screenplay are displayed here: the teen angst, the class struggle and the nothing is like what it seems, but this time the characters, besides being more sophisticated, they behave even more adult, and like the late Roger Ebert said in his 1987 review: ""the teens in Hughes' movies are more grown up than the adults in most of the other ones"", and i agree with him entirely.Adding some curiosities, the star Lea Thompson and the director Howard Deutch fell in love during production and they are still happily married and the main trio are named related to The Rolling Stones, such the song Amanda Jones; the drummer Charlie Watts and the guitar player Keith Richards.My vote is an 8.5 !!",Some Kind of Wonderful

54,renfield54,GREAT SONG TIED TO A GREAT SCENE...,7,28 September 1999,"An enjoyable enough movie for it's particular genre.  Teen-age themes were very rampant when ""WONDERFUL"" was made.  In my (humble) opinion, the thing that makes this movie most memorable is, not just the last few minutes, but the closing song.  After hearing it, I fell in love with the song and the scene.  It gave those last few minutes the ""oomph"" to put ""that smile on yer face and tear in yer eye"".  It is a very fast, very Irish version of ""Can't Help Falling in Love With You"" by (not Elvis) but and Irish folk group called ""Lick the Tins""(with the singer sounding very much like Melanie). While in the UK, I picked up a copy of their CD and was disappointed that the rest of their didn't live up to my expectations.  Some one, working on the movie, had a ""good ear"" for picking out this gem and it is used to perfection.One odd note, mostly everyone I introduced to this song, loved it, especially kids.  Most of my Irish friends didn't see it as ""special"", they said it sounded like every other Irish band.  (That must make Irish bands a great resource.)  Maybe I should get out more, but I consider it their loss.....One point of view I hadn't seen represented in other comments were those a gay friend mentioned to me.  It seems when he watches the movie, he assumes Watts' boyish character to be a male, not a female.  He watches it as a ""coming out"" film and said it was a common interpretation, by gays he knew, in a world where pop films didn't represent them adequately....",Some Kind of Wonderful

About rest of the movie... The first kiss between Keith and Watts was beautiful and passionate. However, it's not convincing that he likes her more than a friend or that her kiss changed his perspective or that he was embarrassed to kiss his best friend and that was an awkward situation. Nor did he had a negative reaction when he kissed Amanda. I didn't want to wait until the end of the date with Amanda to realize it.",Some Kind of Wonderful
56,MichaelMovieLoft,Stop calling me Clifford,7,6 June 2003,"Some Kind Of Wonderful tanked at the box office when it came out, but the truth is this sleeper hit was actually good. And I will even go far saying that this reverse Pretty In Pink is better than Pretty In Pink itself. Why? Good, honest performaces. Hughes decides to leave his Brat Packers behind and went with great choices in Eric Stoltz (who could've gave John Cusack a run for his money in the Teen Angst movie department), Lea Thompson and Mary Stewart Masterson, who steals the show as Watts. Sure the story is run of the mill, but it is the acting that pulls it through. Another good thing is that Thompson's character of Amanda Jones doesn't come off as being a snooty brat (for use of a better word). She is from the same part of town like Keith and tries to fit in with the 'cool' clique. Another good supporting performance is Duncan, the headbanger who is a regular in detention. I love how they forge a friendship through their art. And who can forget how Duncan and the lifers help Keith make his date with Amanda a success? One other thing I like is the soundtrack. It doesn't sound commerical like in other Hughes films. The music really suits every scenes it shows up in (especially the end credits that feature Lick The Tins take on 'Can't Help Falling In Love'). Molly Ringwald reportedly turned down a role in this film, but it's good that she did because I couldn't picture her in this classic. Great film.",Some Kind of Wonderful
57,joliefille411,The Least Offensive of the Brat Pack,8,27 June 2010,"On the surface, SKoW is just another teen angst movie of the 80s. Lots of parents who are squares and teenagers who are misunderstood and, my personal favorite, brooding. Where would the 80s be without the brooding, I ask ya? But what saves this movie from spiraling into a heap of self-loathing is the trio of truly likable leads. What sunk films like Breakfast Club or St Elmo's was entire ensembles of unsympathetic characters that offered no foothold to build kinship with. Mary Sue Masterson as Watts was the undeniable show-stopper. She fit her character to a tee- lovely, but covered with rough edges and a tough demeanor. Even her rival, Lea Thompson as Amanda, garnered sympathy without coming off as whiny and ""poor little popular girl."" The weak link may have been Keith, played by Eric Stolz, who was borderline emo at times. Plus it annoyed me that as soon as he got the girl he spent an entire movie chasing, he no longer wanted her. But maybe that's just my own frustration at high school boys. Styupid boyz >_<Overall, a very sweet film with enjoyable characters you want to see succeed, not just get a punch in the kisser.

58,Illini_Wrestling_Fan,Two Scallywags Spin the Circle of Life,7,14 December 2020,"Trying to get right what they got so wrong with Pretty in Pink (1986), John Hughes and Howard Deutch teamed up again to make this careful study of the high school dating scene. In the poor corner is Keith (played by the original Marty McFly). We first see Keith looking like an absolute dish as he struts down a stretch of dusty train tracks, but he quickly reveals himself as a depraved monster by giving an innocent conductor a heart attack by faking an attempted suicide by train. His rival in the rich corner is Hardy Jenns, a classic spoiled 80s brat who undoubtedly sold his tech startup in early 2001 and now lives in Costa Rica with his sixth wife.The object of these two cads' obsession is Amanda Jones, the role Molly Ringwald wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. Lea Thompson, fresh off her own Oscar-considered star turn in Howard the Duck, nails the part by reminding us that she is more than just a target for the two competing scoundrels.After a downplayed domestic violence incident in which Keith bruises his sister's arm (not DJ Tanner, the other one) his only punishment from his parents is to look at college brochures; this is par for the course as Keith's old man can't wait for his only son to take the abusive show on the road to any college campus that will help sweep future assaults under the rug. Meanwhile Hardy works his charms on a young blonde trying to increase the size of his stable then gaslights Amanda when she stumbles into the hallway factory where the sausage is made.Afraid to limit her options until she can gauge Keith's interest, Amanda continues to see Hardy and convinces him to take his convertible to the gas station where Keith is working to save up money for fancy dinners and diamond jewelry. The film's key confrontation takes place between the gas pumps, Hardy playing the over-the-top yuppie snob to the hilt and Keith going the sweaty, oil-stained beefcake route. While Hardy drives off with Amanda, Keith gets the last laugh by stealing and throwing away Hardy's platinum-plated dipstick.Keith has seen enough. While the rich kids are hanging outside the mall he interrupts his stealthy Amanda-stalking to inject himself into her latest argument with Hardy, playing it innocent with a wholesome date request rather than what he really wants (more of an Ike-Tina Turner arrangement but without any talent).In the buildup to the big date, which the entire community rightly sees as a subterfuge for the clash of titans between Keith and Hardy, both camps hatch plans to take down the other. Keith has the support of Duncan and the detention lifers, while Hardy is backed by 3/5ths of the water polo team.As an appetizer before the big showdown Keith continues to groom his second choice Watts in the event that Amanda chooses Hardy. Watts makes clear her affection for Keith, who wisely plays dumb until he can see what his other options are at the end of this long Saturday night. When the dust settles on the house party head to head main event, Amanda realizes she can do better than both of these worms and gives Keith back the zirconia earrings he forced on her during their date.Just as we see something wonderful, the uprooting of the established social order where maybe now an Amanda Jones can exercise her own independence from despicable rogues like Hardy and Keith, the filmmakers remind us that it was just ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" as Watts foolishly accepts being Keith's second choice for the night, resuming the same old circle of life once again.7/10",Some Kind of Wonderful
59,rossmcfarlen,Hard to watch...,3,8 August 2020,"I didn't understand why 'Back To The Future' (BTF) had to be remade start to finish (Stoltz was fired and replaced by Michael J Fox) until watching this highly-rated 'brat pack' flick from the mid 80s directed by the legendary John Hughes .As an aficionado of the genre I've seen many 80s films, but this one sucks big time for me. Perhaps Molly Ringwald turned down the Lea Thompson part either because: a) she didn't like Stoltz in the lead role; or b) didn't like the script; or c) both.The big issue for me is that Stoltz has all the allure of a bag of wilting lettuce at the back of the fridge and is completely devoid of any charisma, in my opinion. Any of his peers at this time would have rocked this role. I don't wish to be mean or personal; I think he is completely miscast in this role.Lea Thompson never appealed to me in this or BTF; and Mary Stuart Masterson, is the more watchable of the trio if you dig the girl drummer schtick (pun intended). And if you do, the novelty of a drumming tomboy loses its quirky appeal after about fìve minutes.For years, SKOW was difficult to get hold of and it was always on my watchlist of must-see 80s films. As such, I can't express how unegaging/disappointing it was for me on watching it...and I don't comprehend the 10/10 scores it gets on here either.IMO, possibly John Hughes' weakest film from the 1980s.",Some Kind of Wonderful
60,WilderMovieReviews,This is a great film,10,19 March 2012,"This is a film written by the late John Hughes. He has always had a talent for writing realistic and engaging characters as shown in many of his other films including The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Home Alone, & Uncle Buck. All great films and with this one he pulls it off again.The story follows Keith (Eric Stoltz) as he tries to discover his place in the world dealing with his overbearing father who is desperate for him to go to college. Keith is infatuated by popular girl Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson) and he invites her on a date, she accepts and Keith along with help from his best friend, a tomboy called Watts (Mary Stuart Masterson), plan the most amazing date.The cast including Eric Stoltz, Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Craig Sheffer, John Ashton & Elias Koteas is great and all bring something great to each character. The story is basic but it draws you in and doesn't let go. The scenes are beautifully shot and the soundtrack brings the film come to life.This is a really fun film with some great twists and fun characters. The standout character is the skinhead Duncan played by Elias Koteas who steals every scene he is in.John Hughes has created another under rated masterpiece. It is not as well known as Ferris Bueller's Day Off & Home Alone, but due to the more serious tone of the film, this is better.This is a great film, perfectly made and flawless. It's one I can watch time and time again.",Some Kind of Wonderful
61,mindfire-3,i am so in love with Mary Stuart Masterson,9,14 April 2003,"i remember when i first saw the teaser for this movie, like a year before it came out, just a clip of Mary Stuart Masterson playing the drums, but it just showed the drum kit and her hands with i'm sure some great music playing.  John Hughes sure knew how to manipulate the feelings of teenagers; it's too bad i can't think of many movies like these that are made now. this movie may seem quite cheesy now, but i can assure you that at the time it felt very real, and that after seeing this movie i would very much have liked to see Mary Stuart Masterson wearing my future.  her part in this movie is what gives this movie any of the feeling that it has.  i just wish that i could have even been the skater punk boy in this movie just pushing her car.  oh well.  maybe this movie made me have and follow dreams that like Eric Stolz's ""love"" for Amanda Jones weren't founded enough in reality. anyway, thank you MSM!",Some Kind of Wonderful
62,brent-27849,Better late than never,9,15 March 2021,"I thought I had seen most of the eighties teen movies, and when I noticed this one, I almost gave it a pass, but boy am I glad I didn't. Even starting out, I wasn't fully committed to watching it, just thought I'd give it a few minutes, then I would move on, but it got me hooked, right from the moment of watching Mary Stuart Masterson bang out those drums. So nice to find a movie on a lazy Sunday that I had zero expectations and then find it's a wonderful little gem.Of course as others have said, it's nothing new under the sun, but it's all done so nicely. Basically it's a reverse of Pretty in Pink. Thing is I've never really been a huge fan of Pink, other than Duckie, I don't know what it is, if it's just too obvious what they're trying to do, he's a richie who doesn't get along with her friends, she's from the wrong side of the tracks who doesn't get along with his, or that it seems too rushed somehow, something. Some Kind of Wonderful just seems to do it all a little better, more naturally and honestly.Maybe the fact it's not the typical Brat Pack cast helps. Eric Stoltz is good as a regular guy who seems to have a pretty good idea of who he is and wants to be, yet knowing that in high school, sometimes that just ain't good enough. Equally good is Lea Thompson as the hot girl, and oh boy, is she ever hot. And of course as others have said, Mary Stuart steals the show as awesome girl Watts.What I like is that it tries to be honest and doesn't go for cheap and easy stereotypes. For example Keith's little sister, sure she gives him a rough time, but when it comes to something important, she has his back. Even more so, Amanda Marshall, sure it would have been easy to make her into a typical rich b*tch Keith only likes her because he doesn't know her, only to find that when he does, she's a total dud. Instead Amanda is a real human being with real feelings who's really just like everyone else, trying to find a way to fit in. It doesn't hurt that she's played by Lea Thompson, who while incredibly gorgeous, has this incredible nice quality about her, someone who seems so down to earth. Finally what can you say about Watts, tough on the outside, yet not quite enough guts to tell Keith how she really feels about him, she's hopeful but she just wasn't sure. Mary Stuart Masterson is just awesome, plain and simple. I mean with Amanda and Watts, how can Keith possibly go wrong, lucky bast*rd, I should have been so lucky in high school.Just a couple of favourite scenes. Like when Duncan, played by Elias Koteas, completely insults Watts, tries to pick a fight with Keith, gets caught with smokes, booze, dirty cards and insults a teacher and he still doesn't know why he's getting detention, hilarious. Or when Watts has a private conversation with herself right in front of Keith, awesome. Or when Amanda's friends completely shun her, just so heartbreaking.Just a terrific movie all the way around, may have taken me nearly thirty five years to watch it, but it was worth the wait.",Some Kind of Wonderful
63,tstromsn,"Good movie, could have been great...",6,23 January 2019,"...if Eric Stoltz weren't in the movie. Is it just me or does the dude just lacks energy and stage present? It feels like he is in this far away dream land and don't care about anything around him.
In the movie I didn't really understood what he felt, and he just came off like a creep stalking this girl.
Don't get me wrong, he is great for certain movies but in this there should have been a more energetic and more stage present actor.
The other actors does a great job. The villain also acted great as you could clearly see he was torn apart and in love with the girl, but since she dumped him he wanted revenge.
The best performance was by Mary Stuart Masterson who played Watts. The girl madly in love with the guy who were too blind to see.
She were totally believable as a woman in love.
See the movie just for her",Some Kind of Wonderful
64,jane-42,One of the best of John Hughes films.,10,24 May 2001,"I know it's not as well known, but this film came together so well that it can't be denied. A great mix of comedy and teen melodrama, this film perfectly combined all the best elements of a John Hughes film. By switching the sexes- Eric Stoltz as Molly Ringwald, and Mary Stuart Masterson as Jon Cryer- of ""Pretty in Pink"", the film delves deeper than ""The Breakfast Club""- almost accidentally. The chemistry between Stolz and Masterson is powerful and real, something missing in almost all John Hughes films, and it pays off. This one has stayed with me since it came out, and I've watched it since and it holds up really well. Great supporting actors like John Ashton and Elias Koteaus provide fun comedy breaks, and little Candace Cameron as the little sister is terrific too- she went on to great TV fame. But the strength of the film is the fine acting. Stoltz has the harder more thankless role, and gives it a depth and charm that are a relief to see, and Masterson all but steals the movie. Together they are John Hughes best couple, even though he didn't direct this film.",Some Kind of Wonderful

This is well executed film in every aspect from acting, screenplay, story, message, entertainment, sound track, and direction. You can watch it from different angles either for simply entertainment or going deep into the content. The costumes of 80s were awesome. The slightly dysfunctional family of Keith was fun to watch.

67,Rufus-T,A wonderful movie about teens!,9,10 July 2009,"The 80s had so many teen comedies, and I say ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" was among one of the best along with ""Fast Time at Ridgemont High"", ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", and ""Say Anything..."" Not that it was a great comedy, per se, but it was a very in depth look of teenager trying to understand themselves.Eric Stolze played an ordinary teenager, Keith of a middle class family who wanted to go after one of the most beautiful girl, played by Lea Thompson, in school. The problem was that she has an abusive boyfriend who was not happy about his pursuit, so the boyfriend was setting up a situation to humiliate him. Through the experience, the teenagers learned about themselves.Kudos to the writing of John Hughes. Great performance by Eric Stolze. Also especially great is the performance of Mary Stuart Masterson who played Keith's Tomboy sidekick who is helping him getting the girl while at the same time we know her crush on Keith without him knowing it.",Some Kind of Wonderful
68,misslv80,Average Hughes Movie,5,2 August 2004,"I was a little disappointed by ""Some Kind of Wonderful"". In fact, I am in the minority here judging by all the positive reviews that I felt I had to write a review to the contrary. SKOW has been compared as a reverse ""Pretty In Pink"", of which it definitely is. Eric Stoltz plays Keith, a working-class guy who has a crush on a popular girl in school, Amanda Jones, played by Lea Thompson. His best friend Watts is a drummer/tomboy, played Mary Stuart Masterson, who secretly falls in love with Keith.The acting was good and there were some cute scenes. It was funny that Keith had made friends with the ""tough guys"" from the detention hall, a nod to ""The Breakfast Club"". Thompson was sexy as Amanda, on the surface she seemed like the typical, shallow, popular high school princess, but toward the end she added a lot of depth to her character. Masterson was cute, sweet, and pretty. She had a wise intelligence that seemed to fit the personality of Watts. Stoltz was also good as the sensitive young artist Keith who longs for the unattainable Jones while seemingly not able or willing to see the true person who truly cares for him.I felt the ending was contrived. I have mixed feelings about SKOW. It recycles a lot of Hughes's previous storylines/characters: working-class guy, best friend in love, antagonizing parents/teachers/siblings, high school hierarchy, smarmy rich boyfriend, rich vs. poor, etc., but of course, this was the Hughes style and he was the premier teen movie director of the 80s. Probably the scene between Thompson and Stoltz at the Hollywood Bowl was my favorite in the whole movie. It's funny, but I thought Watts and Keith were better off as friends, but that's just my opinion.While I definitely enjoyed ""Pretty In Pink"" more, despite being disappointed by that film as well, SKOW is worth watching if you are a John Hughes fan, but it wasn't one of my favorites.",Some Kind of Wonderful

70,sluido,Some Kind of Wasted Opportunity,7,24 January 2021,"I had put off watching the movie because it sounds like a dorky romcom and the cast isn't interesting looking. It turns out to be a good movie but a huge waste of talent and opportunity to film something different.I personally dislike the cast members but they played their parts really well. Respect to all, especially Lea who I cannot stand in most other movies or Caroline in the City. So, seeing that I actually liked them in this is already something.As for the introduction, what a BAM! Not often does a movie start off with a huge hit song and really introduces all the main characters. Abuse by Propaganda is a perfect way to start off the movie. Within a couple of minutes you already know all the characters and what the movie is about: boy likes girl, girl is with a jock, would do anything to be with girl. Now that isn't very original and boy, without spoiling anything, does get his chance to score with girl, but then the rest of the drama is very predicable and the ending, again, without spoiling anything, is highly lame and takes a cheap romance end. This is probably what turned me to write the review, not being satisfied with the ending and leaving it as if the drama is a pilot for a TV show that will continue the story later.Midway it can get slow and boring. The main character is a bit of a weirdo. He likes art, he is a mechanic, needs kissing lessons (who needs that? Only on TV and not if you are already grown up!) and he flat out REFUSES to even look at colleges which his dad arranged for him. His dad doesn't seem to care that much in the end and it's more about the money set aside being used for something else that ends the entire college idea. Now the way I understand is that the money was earned by himself and not by the dad but I still find it a fruitless way to spend it and I smack my forehead to think about it.Totally recommend it.",Some Kind of Wonderful

Who hasn't shared such experiences while searching for a special friend? That special feeling of calling some one your own takes over your life completely.Clifford (John Ashton ) has put away for his son Keith (Eric Stoltz) a goodly sum for his College studies, but Keith is blinded by his crush on Amanda who seems to be available to all the boys particularly the well-to-do.One of the best and liveliest scenes in the film is the argument between Keith and his father who has discovered that his son has withdrawn the whole sum from the bank account to buy a pair of diamond earrings to impress Amanda and outdo his rivals.Not all the scenes are so impressive and the story line lacks originality except for the ""chauffeur"" scene near the end which was a pretty stupid and unbelievable arrangement.Watts played by Mary Stuart Masterson (and well done too) dotes on Keith but he is too blind to understand her feelings for him. All the mixed and misunderstood feelings require a good deal of sorting out by the characters and this is where the interest lies in the film. Will Keith wake up to himself and realize that true love is knocking at his door?It's a pleasant little story of teenage problems which many of us will recall as a part of our own lives.

Naturally, Amanda doesn't notice him either because she is busy dating the wealthy-jerk (improbably named) Hardy Jenns. It is all one big soap-opera from the John Hughes factory(though he only wrote this one) but somehow it doesn't work as well as most of the others as the characters are so very one-dimensional and the plot is so utterly predictable.

The story felt just like high school felt, with all the painful doubts and growth of one's teenage years, and the film's credibility is greatly enhanced by the excellent performances of all the principle cast members (Masterson, Stoltz, Thompson, Sheffer, and Koteas). The class tensions of the 1980s crop up as real obstacles for the characters to deal with (especially Thompson -- buying in, or selling out?). And how can you beat that great opening theme by the late, lamented Propaganda? Best of all, unlike that humiliating scene in ""The Breakfast Club"" in which Ally Sheedy's outsider character conforms to stifling beauty norms (she was so cool until then!), none of the characters in ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" betray their integrity.

He claims during the film that he feels like he doesn't fit in and having watched it, you'll be able to tell why because he's all over the place. There is no sense of empathy for him and his obliviousness to Watts' affection is just idiotic. Maybe this was an attempt to be avant guarde with the 80's teen genre?? This non linear, random mess will have you baffled. Some really cool 80's tunes, haircuts and attire are fun but the rest is forgettable.

But no, he doesn't even act a little awkward after kissing his best friend nor question his relationship with Watts at all until 10 minutes before the end of the movie after he had his fun with Amanda. His sudden a-ha moment wasn't really convincing, he had one flashback to kissing her and then we as the audience also then realise that even after all that he likes Watts.

I had just turned 19 and had finished high school only six or so months before. God this movie made an impact on me! I loved it! It is so total 80's. What does every U.S. kid in high school seem to want? He/She wants to fit in. To be accepted. Yet others in high school can be so cruel. John Hughes certainly knew how to get into the heart of an 80's American teenager.I could relate so much with Eric Stoltz's character (Keith Nelson) and with Mary Stuart Masterson's character (Watts). In high school, I had a female friend who hung around with me a lot and I had a huge crush on her. I never let her know of the crush for fear of losing her altogether. Also, I didn't live in the city where I went to school. That was basically like living on the other side of the tracks. To top it off, I even had my dad pushing me hard to go to college (which I did).One thing about seeing this movie on cable, DVD or VHSit is not the same as seeing it in a movie theater with an audience. Elias Koteas as ""Duncan"" the skinhead steals all the scenes he is in and makes you laugh hard. That laughter was further amplified by everyone else who laughed in the movie theater. However, Mary Stuart Masterson's heart wrenching emotion transfers very well on both the big screen and on the silver screen.

It might be perceived as more of a chick flick but it's not a typical one thanks to the acting and the master of teen angst John Hughes who wrote the screenplay. Stoltz isn't sappy and Thompson brings a lot of depth to a character usually played 2-dimensionally in movies. Masterson plays a tomboy to perfection but is sexy and emotional at the same time. Keith (Stoltz) has a chance to go out on a date with Amanda Jones (Thompson), the most popular girl in school, but the problem is that her ex-boyfriend is also the most popular guy in school and he happens to be a jealous jock. Sounds cliché? Not the way Craig Sheffer plays the jock. He's menacing and intimidating but Keith's way of taking it lightly and without caring is rarely seen in that type of situation. Oh yeah, and his best friend Watts (Masterson) is secretly in love with him. The acting is great in this movie and to be honest, I'm not sure why a lot of people haven't seen or heard of it. To me it's along the lines of Say Anything in terms of a good story and great and engaging acting. Elias Koteas' small part as the problematic high school student is a great one, too. Also, if you're a Back to the Future fan, it's fun to see Thompson and Stoltz together again after he got fired from BTTF.

But the story is undeniably captivating and heart-warming due to Hughes' incredible talent for writing believable dialogue for young people.  One cannot help but be drawn in by Keith, the young and talented misfit hero, who amazes us with his cool demeanor and confidence in the face of adversity.  Hughes creates a true soul mate for him in the character of Watts, whose strength of character and biting wit blend perfectly with her sensitivity and (not too well hidden) beauty.  It is a film that reminds us of the earlier Pretty in Pink, but finally gives us the satisfaction we were deprived of when Andie chose Blaine over Duckie.

And I stayed up for every last minute of it. First of all, the cast is great. Howard Deutch pulled together some really remarkable actors and actresses for the roles of this movie.Lets start with Lea Thompson playing the popular girl, Amanda Jones. She did a fine job playing the poor girl who hangs out with all the rich kids. This role must of been really hard for her because she didn't look like a poor girl at all. I mean its Lea Thompson for christ sake! And in my opinion we have to give her alot of credit for having the guts to do this role. She came through with it and that is all that matters!Next is Craig Sheffer acting as the antagonist, Hardy Jenns. This guy did a pretty good job of acting as the rich, handsome, popular school boy who went out with Amanda Jones. In fact he did such a good job at acting his part that I wanted to punch the t.v. when I saw his face pop up on the screen. Hardy was a real a**hole!The shy kid Keith Nelson acted by Eric Stolz, definintley reminds me of myself. That is one of the reasons why this movie really inflicted a lot of trauma on me from the beginning. We are both shy, independent, nice guys. I also look alot like him too! Except I have green eyes! Kinda scary if you dont mind me saying. Anyway, Eric does a marvelous performance as the protagonist of this film. Good job man!Last but not least we have the beautifull,breathtaking,astonishing, Mary Stuart Masterson! This movie was the first time I saw her. And she took my breathe away!!!!! Playing the short blonde haired tomboy Watts, she has got some real talent. After I saw her in this movie,I knew I must see the rest of her movies she has been in. And I must say, she looks the best in this movie without a dout. Its just the fact that you can see that face of her's and see her smile. She definitley has the best smile I have ever seen in my entire life! And that is saying a lot for someone I don't even really know that well. Maybe sometime later in life I can meet her in person. I think we would do well together. No offense Damon. LOL!But in all the movies I have seen, Some Kind of Wonderful touches me from the heart and reminds me about life and all the hard times that come with it. This is a landmark movie that will never leave my shelf.Rating:10/10 stars",Some Kind of Wonderful
92,nshafe,This was the worst movie made,1,13 November 2007,"This show flat out sucked. It was about a geekish guy with no clue he was a goober. I don't know what it was supposed to represent? He buys his set up date a stupid, expensive present? To look important??? THe show made no sense and I've watched it several times because of a tough guy character Eric Stolz meets in detention hall This tough guy is great and saved me from capping myself!! His tomboy, skank, smoking Joe girl that secretly loves him is a freaky one too. The characters all look like they are in their 30's. The ending is average and predictable. I wont spoil the ending, the movie is spoiled enough I have seen a lot of movies from this genre, and outside of St. Elmos Fire this is by far the worst. Don't waste your time on this!!",Some Kind of Wonderful
93,wileykylie,"Role models, social conscience, and a fab soundtrack",10,1 November 2000,"As a twelve year old girl, I had a hard time finding role models.  I lived on the outskirts of what was basically a country club neighborhood, but was not that kind of gal.  So I found it wonderfully refreshing to find a role model in the pre-""Girl-Power"" girl power of Watts.  I fell in love along side her (and to this day, harbor a special place in my heart for Eric Stoltz), begged my parents to let me learn the drums, and knew every line by heart.  She was tough, witty, and (according to my older brother) incredibly sexy.  Eric Stoltz is dreamy in a working class kind of way and puts in a performance of true depth and character.  This movie has heart without being sickly sweet.  It delves into family relationships, friendships, and romance.  Most notably, it tackles something that the current teen fair seems to lack, social consciousness.  It's not afraid to break stereotypes or point out social injustice.  Not to mention, it has one of the best soundtracks of the '80s.  I give it an A++!!!",Some Kind of Wonderful
94,Big D-15,"This film introduced me to the wonderful Mary Stuart Masterson, and I have been a fan ever since.",10,8 April 1999,"I thought the film had a well constructed story-line, with a set of first-rate young actors, notably Mary Stuart Masterson, Lea Thompson, Molly Hagan and Elias Koteas. Maybe the struggle to find one's identity was a bit simplistic, never-the-less a good movie.",Some Kind of Wonderful
95,RivetGRRL,One of my all-time favorites,10,23 March 2002,"SPOILER: I seen this film when it first came out and I was 15 years old... it always stuck with me. I guess because the story was a lot like my own life and I could really relate to Mary Stuart Masterson's character SO much. I was best friends with a boy in my class, we were both into music, theater and art and did'nt fit in with the ""popular-preppy"" kids in school and really did'nt fit in with the ""pot-head-troublemakers"" either. We just did'nt fit in anywhere.. but we always had one another and hung out all the time. I was totally in love with him (still am to this very day, he will always be a part of my life and in my heart)... well, he just did'nt have a clue that I cared about him in that way and all I ever heard was how much he ""loved"" one of the cheerleaders. She never gave him the time of day and he still had this ""thing"" for her... Our story was'nt as happy though, he never found out how I felt for him.. I got married to someone else later on and so did he and we have since lost touch and I have been looking for him. Guess the first time I seen this movie, I liked it just because it was SUCH a good movie but a few years later seeing it, it really hit me in the face and to this day I always watch it whenever I get the chance and remember my friend...",Some Kind of Wonderful
96,Transformer,Yet another killer 80's teen movie soundtrack,8,5 October 2003,"Ahhhh, the 80's teen movie, when killer soundtracks were known for their ability to introduce you to new music.  A young, hot post-Mask Stoltz, a perky butch pre-Fried Green Tomatoes Mary Stuart Masterson and a VERY 80's Leah Thompson...  The best scene is the kiss in the garage, of course.  I won't spoil the ending, it's joyous yet it is sad to see it end, as I wish we could all witness more of the young relationship blossom.  A SKoW 2 would be fabulous, even now.  It's 15 years later, have the pair married? Did they experience first love and then part amicably?  Have they lost touch?  This is a couple you can actually care about.  They're so damn likable!",Some Kind of Wonderful
97,suechu,Miscast,3,2 June 2019,Lea Thompson as popular and sexy? Eric Stolz as plain and unnoticeable?? What upside down world is this? Plus the tomboy so-called best friend just insults him again and again. Poor writing and stupid forced acting. The only thing going for this movie is the soundtrack.,Some Kind of Wonderful
98,lctorana,Set the VCR,10,28 October 2001,"This is one of those films which creeps up on you.On the surface, it is a romantic cliche, but it is extremely well done. The main characters, especially Watts (a very young Mary Stuart Masterson), turn in superb performances, and lift this way above the ordinary.Good comic-relief from the support cast - watch especially for the scenes with Keith's sister Laura, and the one between Watts and her admirer - which is a real hoot!For sheer romantic escapism, this film is close enough to perfect.  And can be seen over and over.Enjoy.",Some Kind of Wonderful
99,Billy_Hicks,We're just going to crank this party up to a respectable level,10,24 November 2005,"The best John Hughes film ever. I know that's damning with faint praise - let's face it the man's not going to win an Oscar any time soon - but he is the master of his chosen field. That field may be a sub genre of a sub genre (1980s wrong-side-of-the tracks high school teen-flick with stonking but slightly left-field sound track). But that doesn't mean they're not great movies of their kind.Eric Stoltz is kinda cool as Keith but Mary Stuart Masterson steals the show as tomboy Watts. Keith must be nuts not to see she's the girl for him. But as ""a slave to the male sex drive"" it's the more obvious charms of Lea Thompson's Amanda Jones that float his boat.Watts patiently goes along with Keith's crazy, touching, scheme to woo Amanda, all the while keeping up the witty one-liners as a defence against her infatuation with him. The script really crackles during these exchanges.Watch out for Elias Koteas as Duncan, a shaven-headed punk with a heart of gold. The soundtrack is stunning and well worth getting on CD even if you've got the video/DVD",Some Kind of Wonderful

(ever),10,13 November 2000,"This was one of the best from the whole John Hughes 80's film collection...It was among Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, etc..but this far exceeds...Mary Stuart Masterson is awesome in this film...Not only is she the most beautiful TomBoy i have ever seen, but she was a drummer to top it off...Characters like Duncan and Watts showed us the 80's anarchy side of life to some of us who don't remember that side of the 80's. Great Film, got the 80's genre to the T. Good story of the boy who wanted the popular girl...but as you will see in the end, True Love always wins..",Some Kind of Wonderful

For some strange reasons i watched this movie for my first time today, but i don't regret it. This movie came out one year after i was born (1987), but to be honest the quality of this movie was over the limit.The best romantic\comedy i've seen. Why? While I was watching this movie I kept hoping it never would end. It is dragging you into the story, great acting and beautiful girls with a big B. Favorite scene is where Keith kissed Watts because he was going out with Amanda and needed practice. It was so beautiful, so innocent and in a same time very hot.A movie I can watch more than one time, even if I know the story. Because it has really good scenes and a great plot. The director couldn't done it better! I really hope you watch this movie, it's worth your time and does give you a good feeling after watching it.",Some Kind of Wonderful
102,saffire_az,The Teen Angst Movies of the '80s,8,3 June 2002,"OK, maybe the movie was over the top, but most '80s movies were.  Take it from someone who grew up in the '80s, the topics were very accurate: trying to figure out who you are, who your friends are, the feelings you have, the joy/pain of falling in love, dealing with bratty siblings, and going against your parents.  And the confrontations of kids in school remind people of how major a fight seemed (and this was before guns started showing up in schools on a regular basis).  It's a movie that takes you back to the good ole days.",Some Kind of Wonderful

Even though this movie had pretty much the same plot as just a normal love triangle movie, this movie is definitely one of my favorite love triangle movies. I just adore this. Maybe it's because of the script. Maybe it's because of the cast. Maybe it's because of the humor. Or maybe it's because of everything this movie has to offer. I don't know.

104,giventofly_0,Coolest characters in movies,7,9 June 2006,"I am of the generation that grew up with all the characters in the ""vintage"" John Hughes films, and sadly, shared more in common with Anthony Michael Hall's characters (especially Brian Johnson in The Breakfast Club)than I cared to admit at the time. The main point of this post though is to react to something I came across through another link on IMDb.com - the coolest film characters of all time. This is a debate I have had many times when drunk with fellow film nuts and I can honestly say, hand on heart, that I do not think anyone has ever created a better character than that of Duncan, so wonderfully played by Elias Koteas.The scene where he etches a carving into the desktop then proclaims to Keith ""this is what my girlfriend would look like without skin"" still kills me, even after nearly 20 years of knowing that line is coming.Just wondered what you lot think? I think none so cool as Elias!!!!",Some Kind of Wonderful
105,starrynight01,Who can resist this movie??,9,11 June 2005,"As an 80s movie buff, I stumbled across this movie...read the back cover and it seemed worth the watch. It was.The movie tracks a high school student, Keith (Eric Stoltz) during his most difficult experience in his life thus far: falling for popular girl, Amanda Jones (Lea Thompson).Stoltz, who was well into his mid-20s at the time of the movie, displayed the teenage emotions and their intensities so well that the viewer is shocked to hear of his actual age. Similiarly, Mary Stuart Masterson, who plays Keith's best friend Watts, gives the best performance out of all the actors. The viewer feels for her character, who seems to have a lot of suppressed emotions brewing inside of her with no outlet. Though the other actors also play their parts with a great deal of talent, these two surpass the viewer's expectations. Truly worth the watch, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" will touch your heart.",Some Kind of Wonderful
106,jimscant6901,"Highly Enjoyable, Great Music, Awesome Actors",10,20 March 2015,"This film was a sleeper from the 80s that didn't get enough recognition. What makes this film so great is the combination of non-glossy actors, perfectly timed non-mainstream rock/pop music, and a grittiness that wasn't often seen in 80s romance teen films. Eric Stoltz portrays an A-typical male lead role, Keith, who was more cerebral than heartthrob. Mary Stuart Masterson stole the entire film with her brilliant portrayal of the tough, Tomboy best friend, Watts, who is actually very vulnerable and loving. Elias Koteas is particularly great as the juvenile delinquent who makes the end of the movie absolutely epic! I have to say that the music is just brilliantly done in this film, enhancing and complementing every single scene and eliciting the appropriate mood. Lastly, this film boasts what I believe to be the VERY BEST ON-SCREEN KISS EVER! Never before have I seen a more complex kiss; it manages to be awkward, romantic, and arousing all at the same time.",Some Kind of Wonderful

111,skowfan,The 20th anniversary DVD,10,19 April 2007,"Love this movie. Love it so much that I had to join IMDb simply to register my great disappointment in the 20th anniversary DVD.Yes, it's a beautiful new print. The movie still stands (alone) and it's great to revisit it.But the EXTRA's are SOOOOO disappointing. They interview the cast- briefly- Eric Stoltz and Mary Stuart Masterson are insightful and kind and interesting. So is the girl who plays the little sister. Mostly it's fun to see everyone older. Some have aged very well- Eric Stoltz and the girl who played his sister. Others have not.Then they have the 'commentary' (and I use that word lightly) as you watch the movie. They foolishly only had the director and Leah Thompson commenting, and it's the most shallow silly commentary I've ever heard. ""That shot is lovely, Howie"" ""Thanks dear. Look how pretty you are in this scene!"" I'm not kidding. I could have tolerated this nonsense, if they hadn't gone further.""Eric was tough in this scene. He had his own way of working that made me uncomfortable."" ""I know, he wanted to be called by his character name."" ""Mary Stuart had a tough day that day, look at her."" ""I know, she took it so seriously"" THEY WERE THE BEST THINGS IN THE MOVIE, YOU DOPES!!! And I only wish they'd been allowed to comment on the movie, because their interviews were the only insightful and articulate and smart interviews on the whole DVD.And we true SKOW fans know what happened on this movie- they fired the first director Martha Coolidge and half the cast- does this DVD talk about that? Of course not. They allude to the tension on the set, but must'Nat allow any true emotions on a DVD extra. It's obvious they cut out a LOT of interesting stuff, tried to make it a puff piece. They include an interview with John Hughes from about 30 years ago, not even about this movie. Paramount really let us down with this one.On the whole, rent it, don't buy it.

Watching it during such period of my life, was encouraging for me.  Leah Thomson seemed so ideal but, nowadays, my perception has become a little different.  Poor, lonely, slave of a name, Amanda Jones had to keep herself like a star.  On the contrary, Watts has nothing to lose, so she loves.  The outstanding thing on this film, let me write it again, is music.",Some Kind of Wonderful

Almost all of my friends have never even heard of it. It's a shame. It's one of my favourite movies. I highly recommend seeing it.the storyline is good, and the subplots are good too. An all around good movie. Mary Stuart Masterson is really good in it, and its kind of funny to see her on Law and Order:SVU now, because shes A LOT different. In Fried Green Tomatoes, she was older, and the setting was a lot different, but she was still a tomboy, and funny and kind of tough. The only thing that i didn't really like was Eric Stoltz.

116,da2357,Excellent teen love story,10,18 January 2005,"It's refreshing to have a movie about teens in love that doesn't rely upon sex to gain the viewer's interest. I love this movie, have probably seen it a a few dozen times, especially in the original, unedited version (that wasn't shortened to fit into a two-hour TV time-slot). It's a classic story, but told from a timeless perspective---the movie first ran in 1987, yet there's extremely little in it that would make it seem ""dated.""Mary Stuart Masterson is, as always, superb in her performance. While this is one of her early films, it shows her enormous ability and potential. She plays a playful, feisty, street-smart character that also has a sensitive, shy, and deeply loving side. Mary Stuart's kissing scene is one of the most wonderfully romantic and intense kissing scenes on film that I've seen, yet it has an innocent quality that makes it all the more special.Eric Stoltz and Lea Thompson give excellent performances as well, with good acting and both are able to highlight dialogue with subtle nuances. However, I feel that Mary Stuart's character is the most interesting and emotionally sensitive, enough that she'll bring tears to your eyes. This is an excellent film. It came out at a time when there were a lot of teen movies (Pretty in Pink, The Breakfast Club, etc.), but this is a story that never grows old and is a pleasure to watch again.",Some Kind of Wonderful

That single sentence is so very true. It helped me realize how to stand on my own as a young adult, (I was 23 when this movie came out).

118,lnikias5,surprisingly satisfying,9,19 May 2005,"I don't normally enjoy 80's movies, but Some Kind Of Wonderful is a startling exception. Written by John Hughs, the story-line is far from original, greatly resembling Pretty in Pink, but it still has an endearing charm that makes it a classic. The story line follows as such: the lead male, a sensitive loner named Keith(Eric Stolz) is considered an outsider because he would rather focus on his art work than to be a jock, a nerd, or a trouble maker. He doesn't fit into any preexisting group. His only friend is a tomboyish drummer named Watts(Mary Stuart Masterson) who is in love with him, but he doesn't know. Keith wants to date the popular Amanda Jones(Lea Thompson), but she is dating a possessive, controlling, overtly rich Hardy Jenns(Craig Sheffer). Amanda breaks up with him, and to make it final she agrees to go out on a date with Keith. To Keith this is dream come true. He uses his newly formed connections with the ""out"" crowd to orchestrate an amazing date. Even going so far as spend all his college savings on a pair of diamond earrings for Amanda. Watts, ever faithful to Keith, volunteers to be their chauffeur for the evening. Hardy has invited both Keith and Amanda to a party he is throwing that night, but the real reason is so that he and his friends can jump Keith and beat him up. Keith hears about this and makes sure that his new-found friends keep the fight even. Just Keith and Hardy, but Hardy chickens out and is exposed as the spineless sleaze-ball we all knew he was. Amanda gives Keith back the diamond earrings and opts instead to be alone and learn who she is when she isn't defining herself by the boy she is dating. Watts has left the party and is walking away when Keith begins to run after her, he kisses her and gives her the earrings. Love wins out in the end and Keith utters the paramount quote, ""You look good wearing my future.""This movie has my respect because it accurately portrays the social themes of the 80's without making them look cheesy; themes such as trying to figure out who you were, who your real friends were, the joy and pain of falling in love, and rebelling against your parents. Durring the 80's people felt liberated by the release of tensions with the ending of the Cold War. Stolz gave a great performance as a misunderstood, out of place teen trying to find his way. And Thompson was very believable as the poor girl from the working class neighborhood who tried to fit into the popular crowd; surprisingly enough, she didn't come off as pretentious, quite the opposite in fact, appearing deep and amiable. In America during the 80's social status was much more defined; people began to focus more on the individual and the individual's accomplishments.But Mary Stuart Masterson stole the show with her amazing portrayal of Watts. Not only was she witty, but she carried you along her emotional journey. Even when Keith had chosen Amanda, Watts still stood by him as long as she could. Her tough facade clearly hid an emotionally vulnerable woman who's lifelike predicament spoke to so many.Though this movie was not an initial box office smash, it is a perfect example of the 80's genre. Once you have seen this film it will inevitably become one of your all time favorites.",Some Kind of Wonderful

This movie brought back nostalgia about my own high school experience . My kids see bits a pieces of themselves even though its 19 years old. My daughter though she doesn't like to admit wants to be Watts. She wears bicycle gloves and sings the title music to it while drumming with batons. Annastacia and Rafe know this movie line for line.This movie was brilliantly acted the character lea Thompson plays you wanna hate but cant finding that she is sensitive, vulnerable .As much a victim of circumstance as most teens.Watts has almost masochistic qualities and a self sacrificing love that we all can appreciate it.Today Keith actions might invoke stalker laws, even if harmless.The drinking laws of old 19 parties that don't happen quite as much id venture.Anyways this movie should be a classic and most that lived in that era will appreciate the verbiage, feelings and music that goes long with it.
