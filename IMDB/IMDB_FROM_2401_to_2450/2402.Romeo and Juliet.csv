0,TheLittleSongbird,"Lovingly designed and photographed, overall a fine adaptation of Shakespeare's play",8,3 September 2009,"Romeo and Juliet, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, is a fine adaptation of the play. It is lovingly designed, and the photography was stunning. As the star crossed lovers of the title, Leonard Whiting and 16 year old Olivia Hussey looked the part and acted more than convincingly. However, I do think the supporting performances from John McEnery, Michael York and Pat Heywood were better, McEnery and Heywood were exceedingly entertaining as Mercutio and the Nurse. The script was without little fault either, and the final scene is a real tearjerker. My only complaints are the slightly pedestrian pace and while there are bits cut out, others were unnecessarily extended, for example (I think I am the only person who thinks this) Mercutio and Tybalt's deaths took longer than I expected them to. Despite these problems it is altogether a well above average adaptation of a great play. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Romeo and Juliet
1,bkoganbing,Juveniles playing juveniles,8,19 December 2016,"It took about five centuries for Shakespeare's signature play about young love to be filmed with teen lovers as Shakespeare wrote it. When Franco Zeffirelli got around to doing it as such it put all previous versions to shame. As good as MGM's version back in the studio system days with Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer, they now look arcane when viewing it today, taking nothing away from them as players.Of course this is hard casting. You have to have extraordinarily good actors and charismatic at that for the big screen. What Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey didn't have in experience they make up for in charisma. And being British they're trained in the classics at an early age. This film also gave a first big break for Michael York as Tybalt, a part that requires a lot of passion. You don't get more passionate than Basil Rathbone did in the Howard-Shearer version. But he's as arcane with the rest. York took it down a note or two and played him like a bully. I got the impression that York would be looking for fights if the Montagues and Capulets were bosom buddies.Back in Master Will Shakespeare's day all the parts in the theater were men and there sure was no such thing as typecasting. As we got more sophisticated we demanded more. What Franco Zeffirelli did was now narrow it so that juveniles would be playing juveniles or at somewhat believable kids like the players at Beverly Hills 90210 in their 20s playing high school kids.Romeo And Juliet got Oscars for cinematography and costume design and got a nomination for Best Picture and Franco Zeffirelli for Best director. Almost 50 years later it is still an impressive achievement.",Romeo and Juliet
2,SnoopyStyle,breaks the mold of stuffy Shakespeare plays,8,31 May 2015,"It's the classic tragic romance from Shakespeare of star-crossed lovers Romeo (Leonard Whiting) and Juliet (Olivia Hussey) from warring families of Montagues and Capulets of Verona. Director Franco Zeffirelli brings a luscious romanticism into material that truly deserves it. It's also most notable for the teenage leads which are closest to the characters' age yet. I remember it being shown in high school and everybody whooping it up when Hussey shows up with her ample bosoms in the balcony scene. That doesn't happen with Shakespeare. This movie takes the material out of the usual stuffy high school classroom and gives it real life. Whiting is a little overwhelmed and Hussey does some wide-eyed acting. Nevertheless, it has real energy and still eminently watchable.",Romeo and Juliet
3,Hitchcoc,"It's Entertaining and a Nice Introduction, But Not Real Shakespeare",8,7 December 2016,"Having watched this film about sixty times (as an addendum for my Shakespeare students), I'm glad the kids got to see a play by the Bard. It is very visual, very colorful, with a modern twist and a beautiful Nino Rita soundtrack. The two kids who play the leads are decent actors and they give us the basics. But it is barely Shakespeare because most of the poetry is left out. It also leaves out significant plot elements that are critical to the play. This is about character development and the building suspense and angst that gets us to the conclusion. Too little and too fast. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this movie, but don't mix it up with a real presentation of Shakespeare. There is cutting and then there is cutting.",Romeo and Juliet
4,gavin6942,The Definitive Interpretation of this Story?,8,16 June 2016,"When the now-famous ""star-crossed lovers"" of two feuding families meet, forbidden love ensues.Film critic Roger Ebert has written: ""I believe Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is the most exciting film of Shakespeare ever made"". I don't know about that sentiment, but it certainly is the best version of the story ever filmed. I mean, you can say some great things about the Leonardo DiCaprio version, and some might appreciate ""Tromeo and Juliet"", but this really captures the story...This makes a great breakout role for Olivia Hussey (who never got as big as she should have). But also, who plays the monk? I absolutely loved his character, and it is a role that I think goes largely unnoticed in most variations.",Romeo and Juliet
5,lee_eisenberg,Shakespeare would be proud! Speaking of Mercutio...,10,17 April 2006,"You know the drill: Romeo Montague (Leonard Whiting) and Juliet Capulet (Olivia Hussey) fall in love in 16th century Verona, but the antagonism between their families leads to unspeakable tragedy. And they did a great job adapting it to a movie.In ninth grade, we studied the play. I talked about Mercutio and how he represents the naiveté of youth (his name even sounds like ""mercurial""); not only that, he's the pivot character: before his death, the play is a light comedy, but after his death, it turns gravely serious.As for the other characters, Benvolio's name sounds like ""benevolent"" and the nurse maid likes to make sexual jokes. Overall, the movie really makes one nostalgic for Shakespearean times. Maresca! So just what is in a name?",Romeo and Juliet
6,ma-cortes,A frankly good movie about the immortal and tragic story of the Verona's young lovers,7,14 February 2015,"This lavish British-Italian production about ill-fated and star-crossed lovers deals about the Montagues and the Capulets, two powerful families of Verona , hate each other .

Lush Production Design by Lorenzo Mongiardino and being well-performed, two protagonists are adequate for the roles, as at the play they were fifteen and fourteen years old respectively . The first major film production of this play to actually cast leading actors who were close to the ages of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Julietn. Franco Zeffirelli needed to get special permission to show teenaged Olivia Hussey topless in one scene. Leonard Whiting, who was from Great Britian, was 17 at the time and did not need permission . This is considered to be the best version based on known play by William Shakespeare , though is handicapped because the overlong of this romantic flick . This sumptuously version has the virtue of good and appealing casting, such as John McEnery as Mercutio, Michael York as Tybalt ,Bruce Robinson as Benvolio, Milo O'Shea as Friar Laurence , first cinema film of Pat Heywoodas The Nurse and Robert Stephens as The Prince of Verona . And Laurence Olivier , he agreed to play the uncredited role of the narrator because he was so impressed with Zeffirelli's work for the National Theatre of Great Britain, of which Olivier was director at the time and he did it all for the love of William Shakespeare and didn't accept any payment. Exquisitely cinematography by Pasqualino De Santis, a magnificent Italian cameraman , being shot on evocative location in Verona .

7,moonspinner55,An attractive blank...,5,28 January 2007,"William Shakespeare's much-beloved romantic tale--narrated by no less a grand interpreter of Shakespeare than Laurence Olivier himself!--has the two lovers of Verona (Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey) doomed by the fates and their warring families. This heavy-lidded endeavor (previously filmed in 1936 and 1954) would seem to be quite swoon-worthy at the outset, yet overall it is more proficient technically rather than emotionally, as the acting leads (teenagers themselves) are pretty but vacuous. Supporting performances from Milo O'Shea and Michael York are perhaps more memorable. The costumes and Pasquale De Santis' cinematography won the picture its only Oscars, fitting since the film is really all style. ** from ****",Romeo and Juliet

With an amazing domestic rentals gross of $14.5 million, Romeo and Juliet placed 8th on the U.S./Canadian list of the most successful films of 1969. Oddly, the movie failed to duplicate this colossal success elsewhere, not even in England. COMMENT: Superb performances by John McEnery, Michael York (almost unrecognisable). Long on music, atmosphere, photography, sets, if a little short on acting. Mind you, Hussey and Whiting are excellent. Both handle the post-synching like veterans, with no apparent dichotomy between voice and lip. It is the more experienced actors who are embarrassed by the Italian post-synching, particularly Milo O'Shea, whose voice is rarely in register, and Juliet's father, whose voice is occasionally out of synch. The duels are staged with rare vigor and the medieval Veronese atmosphere is superbly captured even if the photography is noticeably studio rather than natural-source lit. The young players manage their lines with rare authority. While purists might argue about truncating the text, there is no doubt that Z's stylish direction and lush production values approach has given Shakespeare another rather commercial cinema success. The duke has stepped straight out of Medici - what a pity his performance is so stiff. He and Mr O'Shea (whose synching improves a bit as the film progresses) are the main acting blots on the film.",Romeo and Juliet
9,wes-connors,This Is It,10,28 June 2008,"If you're looking for an adaptation of William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", look no further. Franco Zeffirelli captures the youth and beauty of the star-crossed lovers like no other filmmaker. Remember, however, this is not a substitute for Shakespeare's play; rather, it's a cinematic interpretation. Other versions bastardize the original material, while Mr. Zeffirelli faithfully molds it into something alterably true. Most obviously ""different"" is the casting of then ""unknown"" actors Leonard Whiting (as Romeo Montague) and Olivia Hussey (as Juliet Capulet). Their inexperienced, energetic performances are a great asset. Mr. Whiting and Ms. Hussey succeed in capturing the spontaneous ""first love"" of the play; and, they are attractive and effective enough to maintain leading role status, while being balanced enough to strengthen the film's other, important characters. The relatively ""unknown"" (back then) supporting cast is also perfect.Photography, costumes, and sets are all gorgeous. Nino Rota is certainly one of the film's most valuable players; his score, highlighted by ""What Is Youth?"", beautifully captures the spirit of Shakespeare's original work. In a word, exquisite. ********** Romeo and Juliet (3/4/68) Franco Zeffirelli ~ Leonard Whiting, Olivia Hussey, John McEnery, Michael York",Romeo and Juliet
10,sunwarrior13,The Best Romeo And Juliet Film After All These Years,10,1 November 2016,"Well,what can I say.Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey together with its director Franco Zeffirelli have certainly made a classic in this cinema version of William Shakespeare's tragic play entitled Romeo And Juliet.It was released in 1968 and almost 40 years later,it remains the best film made of the said play. The versions released later and even before it still pales in comparison to it. Before I explain what makes it truly a classic,the story of the film takes place at Verona,Italy wherein there is a longstanding feud between two families: the Montague and the Capulets. Both clans get involved in a street brawl that was broken up by the Prince of the city.At night, Romeo of the Montague clan meets Juliet of the Capulet family.Both become deeply infatuated and fell in love.They pursue their romance despite the circumstance surrounding their family.Later,the get secretly married and things become complicated.When the father of Juliet arranges her to get married with the Count of Paris,she escapes from her clan and tried to remain faithful to Romeo by staying with him.But things become more complex until Juliet decided to kill herself with Romeo doing the same as well.No question that this remains the best film adaptation of Shakespeare's tragic play until this time while writing this review.There are many reasons why. First, we get to see the romance between the main characters taken seriously by the film.We can definitely feel for both Romeo and Juliet especially with the love they feel for each other and the romance that they pursue despite the feud that exists between their families.Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey did a wonderful job of portraying their characters despite their youth when the film was made.Their performances was definitely worth all the credit it deserves.Secondly,it was nice to see the story portrayed with a lot of realism especially with the actors not mere memorizing famous Shakespeare lines but rather on full emotion from the themes of joy and tragedy.It was also nice to see impressive visuals and scenes created to make it look like the time period when the story happened.Director Franco Zeffirelli deserves all the credit for it.Finally,the story was told with a lot of passion and intensity that the viewers will surely feel for it especially the lovers of the film.With these reasons stated,it truly remains the definitive Romeo and Juliet film.",Romeo and Juliet
11,preppy-3,Quite possibly the best Shakespeare ever filmed,8,15 March 2008,"Story about the Montagues and Capulets--two families who have been rivals for generations. Young Romeo Monatgue (Leonard Whiting) falls in love with beautiful young Juliet Capulet (Olivia Hussey). They want to wed but their two families are mortal enemies.Opens and ends with narration by Laurence Olivier. The play has been cut and purists were probably livid when pop singer Donovan comes on and sings a song, but this is still probably the most faithful version of R&J ever done. Whiting was 17 and Hussey was 15 when this was filmed--they are (so far) the closest in age to the actual ages for R&J in the play. This was beautifully filmed in Rome--very colorful and elaborate with Oscar-winning costumes. The fights in the film between Tybalt and Mercurcio and then Romeo are just great--full of action. Also there's the now famous music score. But, for me, this just misses the mark on being a great movie.Whiting and Hussey are just simply too young and inexperienced to pull this off completely. When they're speaking, sometimes, they seem to be reciting lines with these blank looks on their faces. It's not entirely their fault--Shakespeare's plays are difficult to memorize. But, eventually, they do get better as the film goes along and I'm not ashamed to admit that I was crying during the crypt sequence at the end. Also, in the PG version, you do get two flashes of nudity after R&J consummate their marriage. The actors deserve credit for doing nude scenes at such a young age. The rest of the cast is just great--especially a VERY young Michael York as Tybalt.So--I DO like it but it's hard going at first (Shakespeare's dialogue takes a while to get used to) and it's way too long. Still I recommend it. Hussey mentioned in an interview recently that people STILL remember her from this movie! I give it an 8.",Romeo and Juliet
12,evanston_dad,Probably the Best Version of Shakespeare's Tragedy We're Ever to Get,8,31 January 2007,"This filmed version of one of Shakespeare's most famous tragedies is likely to be about as good a version as will ever be produced. Director Franco Zeffirelli had warmed up the year before with the Burton/Taylor version of ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" but here he nicely transitions from the frantic comedy of the former to the darker and sadder tragedy of this story about star-crossed lovers (played by Leonard Whiting and the famously big-bosomed Olivia Hussey). Zeffirelli infuses the film with the same kind of restless energy that was feeding the youth movement in 1968, so this is one Shakespeare film that feels completely relevant to the time in which it was released.The film has beautiful production values (the scene at the ball is a work of art all by itself) and of course that famous musical theme. It shows reverence for the original text but doesn't feel stage-bound or stodgy; yet neither does it feel like a product of trendy 60s cinema. And unlike the Baz Luhrmann debacle that passed as a version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" about 10 years ago, the actors in this version seem to both understand their characters and the lines they've been given to read.Grade: A",Romeo and Juliet
13,Sylviastel,The near perfect adaptation of Shakespeare's classic!,9,4 May 2006,"This adaptation is probably the finest involving Romeo and Juliet. Olivia Hussey is superb and so is the young Michael York as Tybalt. Milo Shea plays the friar who helps Romeo and Juliet. It's a tragedy. We all know the story but after viewing it in my high school days, I can't imagine a better film to show adolescents about Romeo and Juliet who were doomed from the beginning. The story of Romeo and Juliet is as old as time. The director does a superb job in recreating the magic, fire, and romance on screen in this film. We believe that we are transformed into their world of Verona, Italy. After seeing this film many times, I tried to watch other adaptations but anything fails in comparison to this classic Romeo and Juliet. The costumes are precise and beautiful. The scenery is lovely and of course the acting is all done seriously and brilliant at the same time. This film deserved it's nominations and awards. It's not easy to take Shakespeare and make it unforgettable but the director has sure done his job.",Romeo and Juliet
14,Smells_Like_Cheese,Now this is what Shakespeare meant when he wrote Romeo and Juliet,8,27 October 2002,"Comparing this to the updated Romeo + Juliet (1996), this one is more enjoyable. And more faithful to the play. It's exactly what Romeo and Juliet was meant to be. It's funny, cheesy, romantic, dramatic. There are some scenes where they carry on too long. But I'm very pleased with this classic. Nothing could compare to Romeo and Juliet. Sorry Leo fans, but this is the best Romeo and Juliet.8/10",Romeo and Juliet
15,OllieSuave-007,Beautiful adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy.,8,1 April 2014,"This is a beautiful adaptation of William Shakespeare's classic and tragic tale, Romeo and Juliet. The feuding families of the Montagues and the Capulets are foretold in the Italian city of Verona, where Romeo Montague goes out with his friends to cause a stir at a party the Capulets are hosting. There, Romeo spots the Capulet daughter Juliet and falls in love with her, while she does the same with Romeo. However, their love for each other are complicated by their families' continuing feud.This movie follows Shakespeare's play somewhat to a T, helped by the actors' theatrical but terrific acting, the colorful costumes and makeup, the beautiful setting and the enchanting screenplay. I first read the play in middle school and again in high school. It was at the latter where I saw this movie, feeling great to finally see a film adaptation of the play I have read and studied in school multiple times.This story may be adapted various times on film or made-for-TV, but this version is the ultimate depiction of the classic tale.Grade B+",Romeo and Juliet
16,ElMaruecan82,Two Teenagers in Old Verona...,8,21 March 2017,"""For there was never a story of more woe than this Juliet and her Romeo"" Children listen to stories that generally end with "" and they lived happily ever after"" but as they grow older, and maybe more deeply involved about the matters of love, the stories that are more likely to find a powerful echo in their hearts would rather have an epilogue like William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". It is as if you could only measure the true power of love within its tragic implications, through the tale of two star-crossed lovers, victims of the feud between their families and an unforgettable chain of events where even their passion would play an ironical role, allowing each lover to mourn the loved one's death.There had been stories of forbidden loves all through the ages and the civilizations, as a Moroccan, I can tell you the legends of Ali and Zaina, two lovers from rival Berber tribes who died of sadness together and the spot of their last rendezvous became the confluence of two rivers formed by the flows of their tears, the meaning of each river's name would be fiancé (for each gender). The two rivers exist so that people can remember the story. Now, this is the stuff that the greatest romances are made on, and one could react to ""Ali and Zaina"" as passionately as for ""Romeo and Juliet"". But it's a credit to Shakespeare's talent to have written a tale for all seasons, a staple of tragedy that wrapped up all the romantic heritage of past centuries and turned into a universal and timeless tale.Indeed, if there ever is a word that captures the spirit of ""Romeo and Juliet"", it is timeless. This is a story that time cannot wither, for it's a story of a love that never fades, a love that culminates at the ultimate moment and resists death; in fact, it is a love that ignores death as much as it provokes it. The love between Romeo and Juliet is eternal, because we all love someone but know that time can affect the strongest passions, that even the blooming flower will fade, so we never identify with Romeo and Juliet as much as we admire and venerate the persistence of their feelings till the last breath. Both ignored the obstacles, rejecting their own names as soon as they became burdens, they were careless, they were kids, and since when do kids listen to their parents? And that's one of the forgotten aspects of the play, besides being lovers; Romeo and Juliet were teenagers in old Verona. They were young and they were innocent, and innocence is exactly what conveys the ""Romeo and Juliet"" of Franco Zifferelli, whose masterstroke was the casting of two unknown faces, two teenagers even by 60's standards, to play the parts of the doomed lovers. Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were respectively 17 and 15 when the shooting started and their lack of maturity made their romance beautifully fragile and poignant. Three years after Laurence Olivier's infamous black-faced performance as Othello, a director like Zifferelli understood that the time of make-believe was over and the audience didn't need a star-studded cast, but needed to believe, in the case of ""Romeo and Juliet"", it's not essential, it is vital.And from the juvenile confidence of Romeo and the naive innocence of Juliet, there is just something magical operating, and after the balcony scene, it is impossible not to believe in their passion. Zifferelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" was made in 1968, one year after movies like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or ""The Graduate"" broke many grounds in Hollywood, but 1968 had a more traditional line-up with many costume-movies such as ""Lion in Winter"" or ""Oliver!"". Still, Zifferelli understood the era and didn't sugarcoat the material for all that; his film is still oddly modern, cleverly using costumes to differentiate between the Capulets and the Montaigues and using sex and violence in risqué ways but never at the expenses of the romance. The fight between Tybalt (Michael York) and Romeo is a heart-pounding action sequence beautifully staged while the infamous bed scene by daring to show the two protagonists naked, prove that Romeo and Juliet weren't just talkers.Yes, they were under the legal age. It even reached the irony that Oliva Hussey couldn't have seen her performance in America. While this aspect had raised some controversy, there's nothing in that moment that feels gratuitous, it is clean because we believe in it and we can see that the chemistry isn't just on an emotional level, but on a physical one too. The movie version can't ignore the play's erotic undertones as it can't ignore that it's about two teenagers and yes, teenagers are attracted to bodies. It is very sad that today, a film like ""Romeo and Juliet"" couldn't be shown on classes because of a few glimpses of nudity while the students can go home and have daily access on porn images that will totally deconstruct their notion of love. We take that word 'love story"" for granted and forget what it means, and Shakespeare's play can give you one notion or two.The film might be overshadowed by the remake starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Claire Danes, but this one has the merit to respect the original material while still making it accessible to young people and teenagers. It captures the spirit of Shakespeare while translating it into cinematic language, with a powerful photography, a perfect leading cast, great supporting performances from Mila O'Shea and Pat Heywood playing Friar Lawrence and Juliet's nursemaid, and a haunting score by Nino Rota. Ziffereli's directing made the rest by finding the perfect compromise between a classical and colorful approach to the play and the changes of society and the tumultuous minds of 1968's mood.",Romeo and Juliet
17,ericstevenson,Best one all month!,10,7 August 2017,"In keeping up the tradition of Shakespeare Month, I am very proud to say that this is my favorite movie of the month so far! I believe I saw this movie earlier in a literature class. As the film is so long, I'm fairly certain I only saw the first half of it, so I took this opportunity to see the second half. This was released in 1968, which was the year that MPAA ratings were created. You can actually totally tell. This movie is rated PG and actually has a brief scene of a topless woman. Wow, could not get away with that today. The weird thing is that I heard Olivia Hussey was not allowed to see this movie because of her own breasts.Yeah, it does make me think about the age old question of if children who act in R-rated films are allowed to see them (and doesn't that violate child labor laws?). Of course, the actors in this movie weren't really kids which makes it all the weirder that there was this restriction. The best thing about this movie is probably how long it is. It's the longest Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen and not a single minute is wasted. It's obviously very loyal to the source material and we get to see all the elements of the classic story here. I think my favorite part about this story in general is the end.Romeo and Juliet have committed suicide and this finally brings their families to stop bickering. The story is a tragedy, but at least it ends up doing more good than harm...I guess. The sets are great and this was also the same time that movies were making the transition to color. Everything really does look gorgeous in this movie. This probably is the version that you should show to a literature class. Oh, notice how I didn't put spoilers in this? I'm pretty sure everyone knows how this ends. ****",Romeo and Juliet

21,Petey-10,The greatest love story ever told,10,12 May 2008,Since the beginning of cinema film adaptations of Shakespeare plays have been made.Romeo and Juliet from 1968 is very good of them.We all know the story.Romeo falls for Juliet and Juliet feels the same.But the only problem is that Romeo comes from the family of Montague and Juliet is a Capulet.And those families are the worst of enemies and therefore the romance between these young people is doomed.I have read the original play by William Shakespeare and I must say The Bard was good with words.The tragedy of Romeo and Juliet still touches us even though it was written in the 16th century.Director Franco Zeffirelli has done his homework good since he came up with something this good.The main actors do very good job.Leonard Whiting is Romeo and Olivia Hussey is Juliet.They were both unknown actors but obviously the right choices to play the parts.And so were all the other actors.John McEnery plays the part of Mercutio.Milo O'Shea does the part of Friar Laurence.Pat Heywood plays The Nurse.Robert Stephens is The Prince.Michael York is Tybalt.Sir Laurence Olivier himself is heard as Narrator in the English version.There are many memorable moments in Romeo and Juliet.There's the balcony scene that I enjoyed very much.And who could ever forget the tragic ending.The poetic dialogue is highly beautiful.Romeo and Juliet is without a doubt the most beautiful love story ever written.,Romeo and Juliet
22,hellraiser7,Timeless Love,10,1 January 2013,"I'll admit I'm not a big fan of Shakespere, nor even a fan of the romance genre. However there are a few that I like because the stories carry genuine emotions that not just make it great but timeless.This may sound controversial but ""Romeo and Juliet"" is one of my favorite romance stories and this is actually one of my favorite romance films.There is just so much I really like about this film. The production value is great because it's all real, it truly captures a time long gone. From the look of the city of Verona, the costume and wardrobe designs, and certain customs. The music is great there are a couple of songs that are memorable. The characters are all good, cast and acted well serve the function of the story. But really for this movie and story we're in it for Romeo and Juliet.Both were cast perfectly they were how I imagined they'd physically look in my mind anyway. Leonnard Whiting was great as Romeo though the one I really liked the most was Olivia Hussey as Juliet. She was just fraking gorgeous she's a natural beauty, I'm glad she doesn't look like some stereotypical pretty girl or some damn supermodel on the CW which is really getting on my nerves; but most importantly a very good actress, it's a shame she really didn't have more major projects because I felt she had potential.Their performances were great they really felt like natural regular people and not just mere characters in the play, which is part of what makes us care about this couple. I just love how they deliver those complicated poetic lines, it doesn't feel like their doing a script reading but actual natural talking which makes the language sound beautiful and understandable and that was the true nature of the language, it was meant to be heard not dryly read. The chemistry both have is great, I really liked the amount of raw genuine emotion both emitted, I did believe both were in love it didn't feel artificial like I would see on one bad teen show too many. My favorite scene no doubt with the two was the infamous balcony scene, yeah I know no surprise but it was just in the way it was executed and the physicality of it, that kissing damn they we're really not holding back shame I don't see that more often.It's hard to say why we love this couple and the characters so much, yes their not exactly the deepest characters, let alone when they fall in love it's rather fast(though same could be said toward the noir genre). It's probably because of what they feel for one another in the here and now, during a time on intense strife which always tries to extinguish the eternal flame of love. The couple represents another way other than fighting, but that it's anti prejudicial both didn't care about which family they were from it didn't matter.And that's I feel the main reason why the story is timeless and retold countless times like the anime series ""Gundam 08 MS Team"" and many more whichever you prefer. It's because their love story has a universal sensibility about it whether it be by race, religion, class, family, or any other feature it doesn't really matter it's what you feel for each other and what you do with those feelings is all that matters.You really are on this couples side as they try to find a happy life together. And they could of if only both families would swallow their pride and prejudice which are both worth jack squat and see both represented an opportunity for peacefully coherence.Even though you know what the fate of this couple is, you like them so much you wish to God it wouldn't happen but there's nothing you can really do about it, which makes it all the more heartbreaking.I've said enough, Romeo and Juliet will never die because their story and love is timeless.Rating: 4 stars.",Romeo and Juliet
23,ianlouisiana,Why must I be a teenager in love?,9,22 March 2007,"Films are not created in a political vacuum and Zefferelli's 1968 production of ""Romeo and Juliet"" came at the height of the so - called ""Youth Culture"",the time of the Summer of Love,Student unrest(Oh God it's so hard to be an Oxbridge Undergrad,yah?),the anti Vietnam War demos,the October Revolution and all those other ultimately futile adolescent pastimes our current senior politicians and Legislators indulged in.As hormonal youths of both genders questioned the values and beliefs of the older generation so had Shakespeare's iconic couple thus Signor Zefferelli was on safe ground aiming his film directly at those who saw themselves as saviours of the world at least until they got a job at J.P.Morgan. As Olivier's ""Richard the Third"" was obviously a product of post - war austerity and Branagh's ""Hamlet"" the last hurrah of Excessive Consumption thus this particular ""Romeo and Juliet"" comes from an age that worshipped at the altar of youth.Most of the adult roles are depicted as wrong - headed or well - meaning but dumb.On the other hand the flower of Veronese youth - Capulet or Montagu - is idealistic, loyal and courageous. It may be Shakespeare - Lite but it is full of vitality and movement. Mr Whiting and Miss Hussey are sweet and innocent,optimistic and full of energy and longing as only first - time lovers can be. They add a breathless freshness to those portions of the text they are given to speak.They truly do not understand why they cannot be permitted to be together.They echo the eternal teenager's cry....""Why?"",and receive no answer they can accept. Fiery performances from Messrs McEnery and Yorke and a compassionate one from Mr O'Shea contribute hugely to the overall success of the film.

It's one of those things you just have to be into.I'm very dismissive of Shakespeare, I think there's a lot emperor's new clothes going on and he gets elevated at the expense of a lot of other good writers of his era.But this is enjoyable. It's so beautiful to look at. The costumes, the scenery and the scene composition just make it a lyrical treat for the eyes. One might argue that diminishes the nuance of the play (a dismantling of the fallacy of true love) but it's cool.The music is sweet, the acting is compelling and whimsical with the sinister Tybalt, funny Nurse and bombastic Mercutio.Also Olivia Hussey is WAY cute in this movie. It's so easy to lose yourself in her performance as the little girl sailing into womanhood soon where she commands confidence and vulnerability very well. She packs an amazing cleavage and, although it's brief, there is some breast if you didn't know.",Romeo and Juliet

26,MissSimonetta,THE Romeo and Juliet movie,10,8 March 2013,"The 1936 film was more star studded and the 1996 film more stylish, but no other version can hold a candle to this passionate and sumptuous 1968 Romeo and Juliet. For the first time on the screen, the youth, sexuality, and violence of the story were not smothered by stately and dull presentation. It is true to the text, but also makes it more cinematic by trimming away some dialogue to allow for focus on visuals.Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting ARE Juliet and Romeo. They're gorgeous and likable as the leads, and their chemistry sets the whole film on fire. They occasionally don't deliver their lines properly, but they do a much, much, much better job than either Leonardo DiCaprio or Claire Danes. The supporting cast is gold as well. John McEnery is most certainly the definitive screen Mercutio.Some of have criticized the acting in this as bad and overdone, an opinion I must disagree with. You have to remember this story is about people whose passions and emotions are in overdrive. Combine that with the fact that many of the characters are teenagers, and the ""overemotional"" acting makes perfect sense.The sets and costumes are as beautiful as the leads. Juliet's dress at the Capulet ball is simply to die for! The main theme, ""What is a Youth"" is heart-breakingly beautiful, perfectly describing the star cross'd lovers' beautiful but short-lived romance. It is interesting to see how love and death are intertwined in this adaptation: the same melody plays both at the balcony scene and the double suicide at the end, and the outfits Romeo and Juliet wore at their wedding are also upon them at the very end when they are about to be buried together.Over forty years have passed since this film was first released to critical acclaim and commercial success, and yet it still remains as fresh as ever. It really is one of the better Shakespeare films, probably among the best ever made. Don't miss it!",Romeo and Juliet
27,gcd70,Ultimate tragic love story,6,1 January 2008,"William Shakespeare's tale of the world's most famous star-crossed lovers is given the cinematic treatment by one of the 16th century poet's well known students, Franco Zeffirelli, who of course recently presented us with a most dramatic account of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"".We have to step back more than twenty years, to 1968, for his version of the immortal ""Romeo and Juliet"". Having done so we discover one of the greatest love stories of all time, blessed with an impressive and enthusiastic cast. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting are very competent as the ill-fated young couple, especially considering their ages at the time (Hussey was only 15, and Whiting 17), but watch for John McEnery as Mercutio and Pat Heywood as Juliet's nurse.Visual splendour backs up the fine cast, with Danielo Donati's wonderful costumes and Pasquale de Santis' professional cinematography both being Oscar winners. Art Direction and Set Decoration is also impressive.Nino Rota's score polishes off an enjoyable movie which will much please those searching for the ultimate tragic love story, although a good understanding of the play (or olde English) is highly recommended.

28,Agent10,The best adaptation of the book,10,14 May 2002,"Franco Zeffirelli created a film which is not only the best remake of this marvelous book, but he also left an indelible stamp on cinema history. I can't say enough about this film. Olivia Hussey was ravishing as Juliet, and the rest of the cast brought about a natural flare for the Shakespearean acting method. If you haven't seen this version of the film, then you're missing out. While West Side Story was a great version of the story, the original still stands as the perfect creation. A good film for young lovers, with one of the best film songs I have heard in a long time.",Romeo and Juliet
29,onepotato2,very good,6,1 January 2007,"When I first saw this I thought that Zefferelli must be the one to credit with the talent here. It is such a full experience. But there's been too many lesser works (Hamlet, La Traviata) from him since. Kudos are to be given though for assembling a talented fresh-faced, age-appropriate cast, on-location filming, imaginative production design, and the launching of Shakespeare's language from recognizably human emotions. Each of these decisions enhances the others. Having people rattle off the language while maintaining a pacing and intonation that we'd recognize today (Father Lawrence, Lord Capulet, The Prince, Mercutio etc.) is another great idea. There is no constipating reverence for elocution here. If people talked like that back in the day, we'd have no living culture. The production design which recasts Juliet's balcony as a massive Romanesque defensive ambulatory is brilliant. An entire culture is revived. This movie launched me into a love of Shakespeare and Romanesque architecture.I've never understood the detractors of this movie. I disagree strongly that these actors are too young to know what the lines mean; which I find is absolutely the problem with the Luhrman/DeCaprio/Danes version. The problem with Shakespeare is being too respectful and getting something restrained and lifeless out of it; Othello, & nearly everything by Branagh.Zeffrelli projects the language onto real characters, There is nothing in Shakespeare that states the Nurse is a bawdy old letch; a trashy sort, but Zefrelli finds it and let's her be a full person; we don't recoil from her. Her lechery makes her a warmer, fuller character She may be the most alive character in the film.You could quibble that Mercutio's slip over the edge is too heavy and too indulged but it's a great character study. You could argue that ""What is a youth?"" is a strange anachronistic foray into twentieth century language. But it still provides a stirring, aching theme.Only the cheesy ending shot where each Monatague finds a Capulet to grasp seems to be a letdown.",Romeo and Juliet
30,invisibleunicornninja,"Read my review, then the rating.",4,24 March 2018,"I had to watch this movie in class along with reading the play. I've got nothing against William Shakespeare, but this story doesn't really hold up. Yes, it is beautifully written, but the title characters are shallow and overdramatic. This story is really a waste of his (William's) talent. As of watching this movie/reading the play/writing this review I haven't read anything else of his, but I've got to say that the writing itself is good. The story is not. If my classmates hadn't been raving about this movie in front of me, I'd assume all the high ratings for this movie came from trolls. Basically the reason for this long intro is that I want anyone who might be a fan of this movie to read what I have to say before immediately voting it as being unhelpful just because you like the movie and saw that I gave it a low score. I'm not rating it low because I was forced to watch it, I'm not rating it low just because its an old movie, and I'm not rating it low because I don't like Shakespeare. I'm rating it low because it is a bad movie, and here is why. Actors - The only person who is really into their role in this movie is the guy playing Mercurio. Everyone else just looks bored. If you watch the people who are about to speak, they are clearly just waiting for their cue to talk. None of the conversations seem natural, and not just because everyone is speaking in poem. None of these actors have good chemistry. The actors playing Romeo and Juliet are both clearly uncomfortable with each other. Most of their kissing is implied. Its actually kinda funny. The problem is that the only reason these two are in love is because they find the other attractive but in the movie the actors clearly don't like each other. Overall the acting in this movie is very poor and unconvincing. Cinematography - I feel bad for whoever was working the camera. They were clearly trying to make this movie as visually interesting as possible. There are lots of creative angles and semi-interesting shots. Too bad its accompanied by terrible audio cuts, a lack of a continuity department, and everything else being horrible. There are also a lot of random shots that are slightly sped up for some reason, which was a bit odd. Its not even full shots - just parts of the shots. Sound Design - I have problems hearing, so I usually pay more attention to the audio more than the average person so I can understand what is being said. The audio in this movie is terrible. The music changes are very abrupt. The audio quality changes slightly between every change in camera angle. It is next to impossible to understand what is being said because the audio quality is so bad. There is also a lot of random dubbing. I know this is an old movie, but that excuse doesn't somehow make it better.Costumes/Sets - Most of the costumes are laughably bad. The sets look ok, but I think that this movie may have been filmed on location somewhere. This movie is very cheap. Yes its old and movies used to have much lower budgets, but that doesn't somehow make it good, and I don't know why people use this excuse when talking about old movies so often. ""Its an old movie"" doesn't somehow magically make the movie higher quality. ""Its made for kids"" doesn't somehow make the movie higher quality. Action - There are a few poorly choreographed sword fights in this movie. Plot - Let's be honest, you probably already know the plot. If you don't, you can just look at the synopsis. Or Google it. The story is shallow and dumb. I don't understand why it receives so much praise. Overall I did not like this movie. There are some bits that are marginally enjoyable, and there are a few people who put in some effort, but I would not recommend this movie to anyone. Its very bad and I don't know why its receiving so much praise.",Romeo and Juliet
31,Galina_movie_fan,"""For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.""",9,9 September 2005,"I've loved it since I saw it first time - I was 16 and for me, Romeo and Juliet were not the Shakespeare's characters, they were just a girl and a boy who loved each other and died together because they could not live without each other. I did not know the names behind the production but I remember that the costumes were gorgeous (I still remember the red and gold dress Juliet wore in her first scene), the score and song were sweet and tender, and the cinematography brought to life a very real Verona, colorful and violent. Only much later I learned that Nino Rota was the composer, Danilo Donati a costume designer, and Pasqualino De Santis a cinematographer. Both Donati and De Santis won very well deserved Oscars.)I was absolutely charmed by Olivia Hussey - she could be the most beautiful (and sensual and youngest) Juliet ever on screen. The only other film I've seen her was ""Death on the Nile"" - and she was not lost among very famous costars (Peter Ustinov, Bette Davis, and Angela Lansbury among others). I also remember that even though I was in love with Leonard Whiting's Romeo, I realized that as an actor he was much less interesting than John McEnry (whimsical Mercucio), Milo O'Shea (Friar Laurence) and Pat Heywood (the Nurse). Zeffirelli came from a successful career as an international opera designer and director in London, New York, and Milan with a reputation for opulent spectacle. It may explain his ability to handle crowds on the screen so effortlessly and skillfully. He also at one point of his career worked as Luchino Visconti's assistant - perhaps he learned a lot from him. In ""Romeo and Juliet"" he was able to make a very dynamic film that did not feel at all as an adapted play and also was a great romance which made me feel incredibly close to its characters. Four hundreds years seemed to disappear and Shakespeare became my contemporary. I've seen ""Romeo and Juliet"" many times and I believe Zeffirelli's is the best adaptation of the play. Well, there is of course, the ballet with the Sergey Prokofiev's music - but it is a different story altogether. 9.5/10",Romeo and Juliet
32,KUAlum26,Lush and beautifully filmed.,9,5 August 2005,"Franco Zefferelli's treatment of the long-told Shakespearian tale of the two star-crossed lovers of Verona is everything a person who enjoys classic,particularly Bard-related,work could want: rich,colorful scenery and costumes,languid music score and actors who fill out the physical and emotional roles more than adequately. Stand-outs in this version include Milo O'Shea as the well-meaning but ultimately doomed to fail monk Friar Laurence and the beautiful(for lack of a better phrase)Olivia Hussey as Juliet.I dare anyone who's just seen(or even seen it somewhat recently)to try and get the love theme from R&J out of their heads! It is a theory that I share with many and that is that many times a movie(usually,this applies to horror films,but it can apply really to ANY genre)can be either severely harmed or innumerably helped by the music score it gets.

33,frankde-jong,"One of the best Romeo and Juliet adaptations, putting more emphasis on the romance aspect than on the violence aspect",8,11 November 2020,"Franco Zeffirelli is a director with two specialties, Shakespeare adaptations and opera registrations. He is sharing the last one with Luchino Visconti and the first one with directors such as Orson Welles, Laurence Olivier, Akira Kurosawa and Kenneth Branagh.Much discussion is possible about the question what are the best Shakespeare adaptations in general. It is however fairlyy obvious that this is one of the best Romeo and Juliet adaptations. The only question is: why?One of the possible explanations is that the age of the actors that play the two main characters is not much older than the characters themselves. This is often a problem in opera. A lovestory about teenagers played by actors in their late 40s / early 50s. However in other Romeo and Juliet adaptations such as ""West side story"" (1961, Robert Wise) and ""Romeo + Juliet"" (1996, Baz Luhrmann) the actors were not old either. Nathalie Wood, playing Maria / Juliet in ""West side story"", was 23 and Leonardo di Caprio, playing Romeo in ""Romeo + Juliet"" was 22.The real reason for the success of the Zeffirelli adaptation is in my opinion that he puts emphasis on the romance aspect of the story in stead of on the violence aspect. Something for which the fast editing technique of Baz Luhrmann is much less suited.",Romeo and Juliet
34,marcin_kukuczka,World's most famous love story brought impressively to screen by maestro Franco Zeffirelli,9,13 February 2005,"Zeffirelli's adaptation of ROMEO AND JULIET (1968) is still one of the most famous Shakespeare's work on screen. At the same time, it is the most popular movie the name of Zeffirelli is associated with. Although it was made more than 30 years ago and it is not the only Zeffirelli's adaptation of Shakespeare, this film is considered the most respected attempts at bringing the greatest playwright's work to screen.The whole movie is a work of art, it is faithful to Shakespeare, and, at the same time, it highly reveals Zeffirelli's Florentine artistic soul. The story takes place in Italy, in Zeffirelli's homeland. Therefore, there is not only the story of Romeo and Juliet, but also the very personal vision of the Italian, medieval society. As a result, the movie accurately presents that period.The principal roles are played by wonderful cast, though not very famous. Olivia Hussey gives a very memorable performance as young, innocent, and pure Juliet. Her face also fits to the role. Born in Argentina, she looks somewhere in between a European and an Argentinian. Leonard Whiting is unforgettable as Romeo. He can beautifully present Romeo's straight love towards Juliet, his temper, and innocence. Except for the main characters, there are other cast that are really worth attention and remain for long in memory after seeing the film. These are particularly, Michael York as Tybalt (one of his very first roles) and John McEnery as hyperactive Mercutio. York can beautifully express Tybalt's pride and aristocratic grandeur. McEnery gives his finest performance in the scene of Mercutio's death. Pat Heywood is also worth consideration as the Nurse (consider the scenes she is so talkative). Although these people had other roles in later career, these ones really cannot be skipped.The wonderful music, a must in every Zeffirelli's film, is another important aspect of the movie, in particular thanks to NINO ROTA. In fact, there are three main soundtracks, ""The Rose Will Bloom"" tune inspired by ""Salve Regina"" and a very melodious, medieval sounding ""Ave Maria"". They are, however, so varied throughout the movie that their versions fit very well to every single scene and make them most memorable. After seeing the film, ""The Rose Will Bloom"" rang delicately in my ears for a long time.Finally, a significant aspect, for me personally, are the decorations, costumes, and the whole convention that is noticeable throughout ROMEO AND JULIET. The way Zeffirelli shows the Italy of medieval times in this film is strikingly similar to his another movie, BROTHER SUN SISTER MOON (1972), being a very ""flower power interpretation"" of the life of Saint Francis of Assisi. In this case, ROMEO AND JULIET is made in a similar convention.This adaptation of Shakespeare's classic is the most eloquent insight to Zeffirelli's directing style. There is everything in this movie that is present in Zeffirelli's works in general: love, music, splendor, costumes, great acting talents, and appropriateness in showing the historical reality. Great movie that deserves attention! Still highly underrated!",Romeo and Juliet
35,sharky_55,And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night.,9,25 June 2017,"It begins and ends with Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, who are the star-crossed lovers through and through. Juliet is thirteen in the play and Romeo barely older, and the fresh-faced pair descend to that level in their words and actions. Most stage productions use adults, with good reason; they understand the stress and the meaning behind each line, the sly wordplay and the literary allusions, while teenagers are still groaning in English class. Yet Franco Zeffirelli knew that a film's fidelity to the original did not have to be complete. He cuts some brilliant lines (generations of young Romeos have compared Juliet's eyes to the stars in the sky) and some superfluous ones, but what remains is the pair's boundless and foolish passion for one another. Watch them come together again in the church to be married, some mere hours after their last meeting, yet they fling themselves at each other and kiss like two ravenous birds, and have to be pried apart by Friar Lawrence. Observe the breathless delivery of their dialogue, always rushing to get to the next line, the next kissing segment. They have no eyes for rhyme or verse, only for each other. The more traditional of the students of Shakespeare may find this blasphemous, but then there are countless dramatic interpretations of the full text for them to savour. What Zeffirelli's film finds is what can't be captured in shabby costume and flat backdrops, of a living, breathing Verona awash in sweat and dust and colour. The cinematography of Pasqualino De Santis captures a city drenched in heat and the fiery passions of two feuding families, with foreheads shimmering in the sunlight with sweat and sharp shadows so alive they almost seem to kick at the dust themselves. Danilo Donati's costumes likewise punctuate the frame with a vividness that matches the brash personalities - Tybalt is all crimson and bright orange to go with his bronzed skin and piercing blue eyes (a missed opportunity here for Mercutio, however). And Nino Rota's famous theme flares up with the same intensity as that of the young lovers, climaxing in a scene at the party so lush and terribly romantic it almost renders the first exchange of rhyming quatrains unnecessary. Romeo is the link between violence and sensuality, between the dusty, earthy day and the serenity of night, although the latter lacks the visual imagination of the former. Shakespeare's antithesis of light and dark makes up many of the crucial images of the play: the flash and sparkle of a lover's eye, the sun and moon as beauty and terror, the seductive and morbid blackness of the wedding bed and then the tomb. Zeffirelli may have taken care to shoot on location as much as possible, and yet the balcony scene reeks of studio lighting, and a dull darkness. In one moment Juliet tightly grasps Romeo's hand and swears her love, and De Santis frames a tiny sliver of moonlight so that it hits only her gleaming eye, full of wonder and hope and adoration. This is offset by the constant top light which illuminates the entire frame in a way that removes much of the allure of the situation. Zeffirelli compensates in other ways; Romeo may be waxing lyrical about Juliet's eyes, which shine brighter than all the stars in all the heavens, but what is also in centre frame? Her porcelain skin, and the hint of cleavage accentuated by the plunging neckline of her bodice. The physicality of the attraction is underlined, and the burgeoning youth of the performers is once again made crucial. This physicality is mirrored in the masculine feuds out on the sun-baked streets of Verona, where the Montagues and Capulets swipe at each other until a blow turns deadly. It is here that Zeffirelli perfects the comedic swagger and flamboyance of Tybalt, Mercutio and their hordes, and how to channel that playful energy into wrath. The camera is perched right in the very midst of their quarrels, spinning dizzyingly as if on a carousel, and then suddenly a blade is bloodied, and a frantic, Peckinpah-esque zoom draws attention to the story's breaking point. Beforehand there is the same dizzying zeal in the boys' bawdy exchanges with the nurse, who scolds Romeo's company but can't help but grin at his wordplay all the same (she's of a lower class, speaking mainly in prose). She's portrayed by Pat Heywood with springs in her feet, bouncing and beaming from scene to scene, providing the comedic flourishes that Shakespeare wields to further drive the inevitable tragedy. The nurse exemplifies the swelling exuberance of the entire film, as do Mercutio and Tybalt, and Romeo and Juliet, who must bear the mantle of the greatest love story of all time. We are all familiar with their demise, although we often forget that they were merely teenagers. But Zeffirelli remembers.",Romeo and Juliet
36,johno-21,Fine film adaptation of the timeless classic,9,27 March 2006,"I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have only seen it a couple of times since. Director Franco Zefferelli was well versed with the classics and done directing and production design for the stage in drams and operas and in his filmed adaptation of the famous Shakespeare story of the doomed lovers Romeo and Juliet he successfully transcends a stage experience to the screen. In the lead were two London stage teen actors Leornard Whiting who had a couple of London stage appearances before this film most notably in Oliver never made it in films while Olivia Hussey who had been appearing on stage in London since the age of seven has had a long and versatile acting career in film and television but never had another choice role like Juliet. Zefferelli along with Franco Brusati and Masolino D'Amico wrote the screenplay. It was nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design. Paqualino De Santis won the Oscar for his lush beautiful photography and Danilo Donati won the films second Oscar for the period costuming. Celebrated composer Nino Rota should have been nominated for his memorable music score and the film should have received an art direction nomination as well. I think Whiting may have been miscast as Romeo and Hussey performance was a little to much of a caricature but this is a good film and works well. A strong cast of stage performers in support including Robert Stephens, John McEnery and Pat Heywood as well as Michael York who would have the most successful career in film of the cast.

40,FloatingOpera7,The Romeo And Juliet Shakespeare Himself Envisioned,10,14 February 2005,"Franco Zefferelli is a genius. His greatest film was this adaptation of Shakespeare's romantic tragedy. Even though he is probably in his 70's now, Zefferelli is still making films. A recent hit was ""Callas Forever"" his tribute to the great opera legend Maria Callas. In the 60's, he was laughed at when he proposed a lavish and bold new production of Romeo and Juliet for the big screen. It was considered old-fashioned by then. In the 30's and 40's, only older distinguished British actors portrayed Romeo- Laurence Olivier, Orson Welles, Leslie Howard, etc. And older women portrayed Juliet. Zefferelli, displaying accuracy and truth to Shakespeare's vision, cast two young actors who had never met one another- Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. Whiting (Romeo) was 18 years old at the time while Olivia Hussey was either 16 or 17 during the production of the film. It was released in 1968 and made it big in America. The 60's and its ideals of freedom, peace and love, welcomed this tragic tale that served as an example of why peace and love is so vital. The Capulets and the Montagues make peace only after the gruesome death of the lovers. Zefferelli lavished detail and care to perfection in every scene. The location is an actual Italian city polished to look like the time of the Renaissance. Everything is a vibrant reminder of the gilded Renaissance- the style of dress, the buildings, the fountains, the windows, the wine goblets, the dinner tables, the torches, etc. The greatest showcase for Renaissance spectacle is seen in the Ball where Romeo and Juliet first meet. Another hit was the original new song ""What is a Youth ?"" whose theme was played repeatedly in the film. It's romantic and melancholy. The original music was composed by Nino Rota, a veteran musical composer for Italian cinema.Olivia Hussey was under age at the time she made this movie, but she was already treading new ground by appearing topless in the love scenes. Whiting, too, appeared in the nude. For this reason and perhaps the violence in the feud scenes, the movie was rated R. No one under 18 could see this film unless accompanied by an adult. Even Olivia Hussey herself could not see the film upon its release because she was not yet 18. Essentially, Zefferelli presented only the highlights from the play. Being a movie which is limited to time (2 hours ) he cut some lines short. I.E....When Juliet has drunk Friar Lawrence's potion and falls into a death-like sleep, her father Lord Capulet needs only to say ""Death has marked her lips like an untimely frost"" and there was no need for the extended scenes of mourning and anguish by the other characters. The movie is still true to Shakespeare's original vision. It was inspired in part by the late 60's pop culture- the men, Rome included, have made up their hair in Beatles haircuts and the blatant sensuality of Romeo and Juliet's romance was not seen as anything new when considering that Hugh Heffner was already publishing Playboy and nudity in Italian cinema would further be observed in Fellini's Satyricon. Zefferelli, who is a homosexual, has an an eye for opulence and extravagance, but he always makes it in a way so that it looks logical and dreamy. This movie looks like a painting, like a time capsule. It is just as Shakespeare would have himself envisioned.",Romeo and Juliet
41,Hayden-86055,My favourite adaption,8,31 December 2020,"Perfectly follows the story with only a few deviations to save time, the 1968 original is definitely one of my favourite Shakespeare adaptions.Featuring Olivia Hussey as Juliet, Leonard Whiting as Romeo and the famous Michael York as Tybalt in some excellent acting roles. Plot wise it follows the play very well with just a few minor changes that work well. Costumes are fantastic, cinematography is great and the fight scenes creatively co-ordinated.8/10: Really very good",Romeo and Juliet
42,Darkside-Reviewer,I came to review not to quarrel and bicker,7,13 October 2019,Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet is undoubtedly the greatest story of love and loss ever told a story played out so many times on screen and in plays by actors and actress's on Broadway and in small theatres who consider playing a role in such a classic tale as a career highlight and hope to do justice to one of Shakespeares most beloved works even in the modern day there has been countless movie interpretations at least one in every decade since the 50s to 2019.This particular interpretation of Romeo and Juliet is a fairly good movie that follows Shakespeares original text pretty well while also adding some very minor dialogue changes to help with scene transitions and exposition shots this is to be expected as even on stage actors in plays will change a line here or there but it's hardly noticeable with the original script and stage directions remaining very faithful.Visually the movie still looks great and because of classic film making the time era looks more authentic with most of the scenes being filmed on location rather than on a set which makes the scenes that involve swordplay and duelling look great with real sunlight shining on the Rapier blades and the dusty ground dirtying the mens clothes boots and body while rolling around in it which in those days actors actually had to do not just get makeup put on them.Leonard Whiting plays the young Romeo and alongside Olivia Hussey playing the fair Juliet give amazing performances and create a unique on screen chemistry that really makes you wish there characters didn't part in such sorrow Olivia Hussey was only 15 when she played Juliet on screen which really makes you appreciate the dedication and unique talent she brought to the role at such a young age.I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys classic movies this is a great interpretation of Romeo and Juliet.,Romeo and Juliet
43,Movie-12,An unsuccessful take on an unsuccessful play. ** out of ****,5,2 January 2000,"ROMEO AND JULIET (1968) **Starring: Leonard Whiting, Olivia Hussey, Milo O'Shea, John McEnery and Pat Haywood Director: Franco Zeffirelli   Running time: 138 minutes   Rated PG (for some sexuality)  By Blake French:	William Shakespeare has inspired dozens of Romeo and Juliet films over the years. It is very hard to review a movie based on a play tragedy, which I have indeed read, and not enjoyed. If you are an individual who inhabits a liking for Shakespearean tales, ''Romeo  and Juliet'' may be for you--but this film doesn't quite earn my recommendation.	I dare not bore you with the story to ""Romeo and Juliet,"" if you haven't been introduced to the characters or tragic events that take place in the script, then I recommend you indulge yourself into this, or any other movie continuing this title. Here are some notes taken while screening this version ''Romeo and Juliet'':· The opening sequence does a good job of developing the character tides, but goes a little overboard.· The films material just doesn't stand as memorable cinema in the late year of 1999. The story, situations, and conflicts are all somewhat outdated. I am not closed minded or anything, I appreciate good cinema, but this film isn't really that good.· The characters are well acted, Romeo is presented with the right moodiness and period circumstances by Leonard Whiting.· Good mood and atmosphere development. The time period is very convincing.
· Even when the dialogue gets off track and stumbles over overly lengthy monologues, the film keeps its cool.· Cinematography and production is very detailed and extraordinarily realistic.· Costume design is gorgeous· Much like an old fashioned ""Titanic""; a doomed love story.· Good romantic chemistry between Romeo and Juliet.· The scene where Romeo and Juliet first meet is much of a disappointment; all the two do is stare into each others eyes are kiss like fools.· I am surprised of how little I felt and cared for the characters here--although I admit the problem might be myself.· The story itself, as in the original play script, wreaks of desperation. I did not care for it. The characters act like fools much of the time, I kept asking myself  how this story became so famous and well liked.· The structure contains a line of rising tension like it should.· I have always bought the passion between Romeo and Juliet is a form of lust, not love. After all, as a skeptical, I have a hard time in believing in the concept of love at the direct first sight. Sorry Shakespeare.	Brought to by Paramount Pictures.",Romeo and Juliet
44,sashank_kini-1,"The young cast inflames the sexual chemistry, the romantic poetry and the adrenaline rush of the film, keeping the spirit fresh, effervescent, spontaneous and lively",9,14 December 2012,"The friendly duel between Mercurio and Tybalt turns fatal when the later accidentally wounds Mercurio when Romeo comes in their way. The next duel between Romeo and Tybalt is more serious and more violent. While in the first duel, there is only playful hooting and cheering heard in the background, in the second there is panic, yelling and tense clanking of swords, every sound keeping us in anticipation for that fateful moment that shall change Romeo's life. Both the duels are craftily filmed and brilliantly enacted not only by the duelers but also the spectators – young, hot-blooded, reckless men who are heedless of the possible consequences of their adventurous actions. In fact, it is this young blood that inflames the adrenaline rush, the sexual chemistry and the romantic poetry of 'Romeo and Juliet'; Franco Zeffirelli was absolutely right in his casting choices of not just the leads but also the supporting characters and extras.The renowned adaptation of Shakespeare's world-renowned play of the same name is about two unfortunate star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet; both are the only children of rival families Montagues and Capulets respectively, whose inveterate hatred towards each other stands in the way of their pure love. The two lovers are aided in their secret love affair by a friar and Juliet's nurse and everything goes steady until Romeo, as an act of vengeance, slays Tybalt, Juliet's cousin for murdering Romeo's best friend Mercurio. There ends the comedy and then ensues the tragedy but with a redeeming consequence for the feuding families. Romeo and Juliet is a very sexy play which may turn into trite love story in the wrong hands, and Franco does not allow this to happen – his cast is primarily young, beautiful, fresh and effervescent. The chemistry between them is lively and spontaneous and set the perfect mood for the film. Unable to control his impulses, Romeo reveals himself to Juliet by stumbling towards her below her balcony and you really feel that only a young, not-very-experienced actor would have done that so well. Even later, after Romeo tells the nurse about his plan, he begins to leave but stops suddenly on his tracks and gestures towards her to lead the way. The action again succeeds only when the actor playing Romeo is young; in the case of Mercurio, an older actor would've ruined Mercurio's vigorous charm by acting slightly obnoxious and too bawdy and lascivious to be likable. Youth keeps charm afresh, and all the scenes therefore seem perfectly executed with the young cast. Franco Zeffirelli also trims the play very well, reducing the emphasis on Rosaline and thus making Romeo seem less impulsive a character. While reading the play, I was slightly off-put when the tone abruptly switched after Capulet welcomes his guest, to Romeo asking the servant about Juliet; in the film, Franco does a great job at protracting the scene with Romeo searching first for Rosaline and then seeing Juliet at a distance, dancing gracefully along with Paris. The banquet sequence is excellently shot, cutting from long wide angle shots of the guests dancing (and it was such a different dance from the silly hands-in-the- air dance we do now) to medium shots of Juliet and Romeo encountering each other while dancing and also cutting away to shots of a furious Tybalt lambasting Capulet for allowing a Montague to set foot at their house. Franco cuts out Paris' death towards the end (was it really required?) of the story and trims some of Juliet's wonderful lines, but I was fine with that too (after Tybalt's death and the prince's announcement, the scene cuts/dissolves to Juliet sobbing with the nurse in the film, unlike the play in which Juliet gives a long monologue awaiting the nurse's return, then thinks Romeo is dead, then thinks both Romeo and Tybalt are dead, and then finds out the true story unnecessary).The melodic score by Nino Rota is memorable, especially the tune that plays at three or four points whenever Romeo and Juliet are together, but towards the end when you hear it you feel sad because it was the same score played with different tempo during the balcony scene. Whiting, playing Romeo is a shade more convincing than Hussey, playing Juliet but both have superb intimate chemistry, and the best part is that neither of the actors are experienced. John Mcenery plays Mercurio with vital energy, and humor and inescapable charm, though I wish I could find out why he was the way he was – some say he had homosexual tendencies towards Romeo but not with absolute certainty while others just consider him slightly wayward in character. The highlight is the hilarious encounter between Mcenery and the nurse, and this was Mcenery had to be careful not to look to offensive in his handling/fondling and he does it charmingly, kissing her on the cheeks after troubling the poor lady. Speaking of nurse, Pat Heywood was rollickingly sweet and funny, and Michael York has the appearance of a wolf that well suits his character. Although we do not hear Italian accent, we get a flavor of it, as in when Romeo air kisses in a very Italian way at the church after meeting the nurse; the boisterous energy is also associative to Italians. The extras also do a great job o setting the right mood, for example, when the singer croons at the banquet and Juliet and Romeo move towards each other, the expressions on the faces of the guests busy listening to the sweet music is notable: an old man tilts his head towards one side and holds one hand near his ear as if straining slightly due to age and remembering fond old memories. Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet is a classic; like James Cameron's Titanic, it's young blood keeps its passion fresh and flaming.",Romeo and Juliet
45,RossRivero99,One of the best romance movies ever made,10,22 November 2014,"Franco Zeffirelli's adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet was one that brought one of Shakespeare's most famous plays back to life again on the big screen. The movie tells the story of two future lovers one named Romeo Montague (played by Leonard Whiting) and the other named Juliet Capulet (played by Olivia Hussey) who end up falling in love with each other when they first look at each other, even though both of their families have been arguing for several years even after Romeo and Juliet first started falling in love. The movie isn't the regular romantic movie you would expect, but instead it is on the tragic side of romance. The movie also features an excellent supporting cast which includes Michael York as Juliet's cousin Tybalt (who ends up getting killed by Romeo in an act of self defense), Milo O'Shea as Romeo's father who eventually ends up marrying the two,Paul Hardwick and Natsha Parry as Juliet's parents, Pat Haywood as Juliet's family nurse, and so many other people. Th ending scene is the saddest part of the movie because when Romeo enters the area where his dear love Juliet is laid to rest, and he commits suicide with poison, and then his dad comes in only to find him dead, then Juliet wakes up only to find Romeo dead and then Romeo's father tries to help her escape, and instead she stays in the area of which she was buried and commits suicide as well. But in the end it was still a well done play adaptation as well as one of the best movies ever to be based on plays.",Romeo and Juliet
46,oOoBarracuda,"""For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo.""",6,16 March 2016,"I was finally able to finish House of Cards so I could get started on my movie list for March; better late than never, right? I chose to watch first perhaps the best known and most imitated work of Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet. I chose the 1968 adaptation directed by Franco Zeffirelli, starring Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey in the titular roles. I selected this adaptation because everything I had read indicated that it was the most faithful adaptation. I wanted to start out my month of Shakespeare strong, and this version of Romeo and Juliet did not disappoint. I'm almost certain that everyone knows the story. The classic tale of forbidden romance ending in tragedy. Teenagers from two competing families unexpectedly fall in love. Romeo Montague (Leonard Whiting) spots Juliet Capulet (Olivia Hussey) while attempting to create a ruckus at a Capulet gathering. Unable to get the young girl out of his mind, Romeo seeks her out under the cover of darkness. Unbeknownst to him, Juliet saw him at the party too and has also fallen instantly in love. At her balcony, Romeo professes his love to Juliet and vows that she will remain the only woman in his heart. Juliet obliges and agrees she will not seek the company of any other men. The problem for their budding romance is their families' years- long feuding. The Capulets and Montagues are hopelessly divided and any romance intermixing the two families would be received as betrayal. In secret, their relationship presses on, culminating in a secret marriage. Juliet is then promised in marriage to a man of her father's choosing. Devastated by the thought of marrying another, and unsure what to do about her predicament, Juliet drinks a potion which will render her with the appearance of being dead. Her co- conspirator, Friar Lawrence (Milo O'Shea) is to get a message to Romeo about the plan. The goal was for Juliet to appear dead long enough to be entombed, then, regain consciousness and run away with Romeo. Romeo never receives the message, and believing Juliet to be dead, poisons himself. When Juliet awakes, sees Romeo has died, kills herself, unwilling to live a life without his love. Obviously, a heavy story involving two teens engaging in a forbidden love, this version of Romeo and Juliet was incredibly faithful to the Shakespeare play. This faithful adaptation bogged down the story with heavy period dialogue. There was also a problem with sound throughout this film. In several scenes, especially high-intensity ones, the speech being heard didn't match the actor saying the words, which was a bit distracting. The sound in the opening battle scene was so off, it was almost comical. The camera work throughout the film made it very dated. Many techniques reeked 1960's and made the film a bit less visually appealing. There were high points to the film. I quite enjoyed the theatrical feel of the film. I enjoy watching plays, and like a movie that can recreate that feeling. The acting was also very well done. Romeo and Juliet showed a wonderfully reserved chemistry on-screen. The actors had to appear hopelessly in love, yet must hide their love from others, no small task, especially for younger actors. Although I don't know how many more times I will see this film, it did prove an exceptionally faithful adaptation of the bard's magnum opus.",Romeo and Juliet
47,hollywoodshack,"Excellent movie music, sets, atmosphere",10,8 February 2021,"Haven't seen this recently, but I can always remember the haunting musical score and the perfect performance of Olivia Hussey as a youthful teenage Juliet.

Film works best at showing the youth of the tragic teens and how their simple desires are thwarted in the complicated mire of the adult world.

50,roghache,Stunning portrayal of Shakespeare's romantic tale of woe,9,3 March 2006,"If you're a fan of the Bard's timeless tale of forbidden young love, and even if you're not, then you're in for a treat. Franco Zefferelli's spectacular cinematic version of Romeo and Juliet eclipses all others. Don't even bother with Leonardo DiCaprio or any of the other renditions that pale by comparison. This is the real Romeo and Juliet as Shakespeare himself, lived he in our era,would have orchestrated its filming.From the opening scenes at Capulet's ball, you'll be transported from this time and place to Renaissance Verona. It's a real period piece and worth watching for the sets and costumes alone. Stunning cinematography with sweeping colorful panoramas...the period ball, the dueling and crowd scenes, the morbid tomb...The young actors, Leonard Whiting at 17 and Olivia Hussey at 15, are the age Shakespeare intended and magnificently portray the ""star crossed lovers"" with very believable chemistry. Olivia's Juliet has the right mix of youthful innocence and passionate intensity. With her masses of long black tresses, no wonder Romeo declares ""she doth teach the torches to burn bright"". The balcony scene, brilliantly filmed, rings true and the wedding night (actually morning after) is touchingly and tastefully done, even with its hint of nudity for the teenage stars.The movie has a superb supporting cast, including John McEnry as Romeo's hot tempered and humorous friend, Mercutio, and Michael York as Juliet's rather despicable cousin, Tybalt. Personally, I find Mercutio's death the most moving in all Shakespeare. Although the feuding Montague and Capulet parents are supposed to be the villains of the piece, Lord Capulet actually seems quite sympathetic in his moving portrayal of grief in the loss of his daughter.No spoiler warning here. This quintessential tale of doomed love is familiar to everyone. However, these stars give such compelling performances that you'll be longing for a different ending, riveted to your seat praying the messages will get through properly this time. Whiting and Hussey deliver such grief and passion in the final tomb scene, you'll experience this tragedy as never before. Apart from omitting Romeo's killing of Paris (my sole complaint), the movie is true to the major events of the play. And it's hard to fault the dialogue. Despite occasional omissions and minor alterations, it was written by the English language's foremost expert. My son, normally an enthusiast of Shakespeare's tragedies, claims with some justification, that this particular play is a silly, unbelievable tale, though told with absolute brilliance. Even if you're not normally a Shakespeare buff, don't miss this amazing movie. Seeing his timeless ""tale of woe"" brought to life so compellingly and in such a magnificent manner might just turn you into one.",Romeo and Juliet
51,ozthegreatat42330,The Quintessential Version of Shakespeare's Great Romantic Tragedy,10,19 May 2007,"It would take an Italian Director, Zeffirelli, to adequately film the most famous love story/tragedy in history and make it work beautifully. Filmed in Italy and actually using teenage actors to play the star-crossed lovers at the right age (for the first time ever) brought great veracity and a definite freshness to this story. The performances were uniformly outstanding and of course Nino Rota's touching sound score wove the whole thing together in a highly charged emotional work. It tends to take the viewer through the uncomfortable feeling of viewing a tragedy in the making, knowing what is to come, and being unable to do anything but helplessly watch as it comes to pass. This is the film- maker's art at its best, and it is a pity that the film did not win the Best Picture Academy Award in its year. If you have a love of Shakespeare at all this film is a simple must see.",Romeo and Juliet
52,Hermit C-2,The greatest film I've ever seen.,10,10 April 1999,"To my way of thinking, this film should be considered when people discuss the greatest movies of all time. Every scene, practically every frame of this movie is brilliant. Director Zeffirelli went against the ancient practice of using older actors in the title roles, and the performances he elicits from teenagers Whiting and Hussey is amazing. Although he trims the dialog heavily in places (Romeo says, ""But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?""- and leaves it at that) his version captures all the passion of Shakespeare's play magnificently.The scenes at the Capulet's ball at which the two young lovers meet are about the greatest I've ever seen on screen. The famous balcony scene avoids cliches altogether and makes others pale by comparison. The Queen Mab speech, the fight, and the scene in the tomb are all exquisite highlights of this film. Even the dubbing for the Italian actor's voices and of the crowd noise is superior. It is amazing to me that an Italian could be so sensitively in tune with one of the English language's most sublime works.Zeffirelli wanted to make a movie that spoke to youth and he succeeded, to put it very mildly. If school systems were smart, they'd pack up their freshmen and sophomores on buses every year, drive them to a local theatre and show them this movie. I can't think of a better investment in young people's education that could be made. It worked for me.",Romeo and Juliet

The kind of young lady every boy wants as a babysitter.THIS...is a fantastic movie - a classic! Probably the greatest 'love- story-tragedy' ever put to film, or, to paper (maybe only rivaled by ""Doctor Zhivago"")! Olivia Hussey is absolutely stunning as Juliet...the woman of every man's (and, boy's) dreams! I watch this movie from time to time, and, even though I'm now 49, during the part where Romeo and Juliet first meet, when Romeo is sneaking about in a mask to meet Juliet, just as Juliet sees Romeo and tries to find him; and, all the while ""What Is A Youth"" is being sung...I weep. To me...this is the most romantic thing in the world (Cupid...for real)! And...the climax of this scene is PRICELESS! This is the kind of 'real love' that has been mostly forgotten and lost throughout the centuries...where a man can show weakness for the love he feels for a woman; and, a woman accepts this weakness as 'real love,' and, not an opportunity to use his vulnerability to dupe him into some sort of controlling or financial bondage.This movie, and, the book, are of ""REAL LOVE!"" Where a man and a woman TRULY LOVE ONE ANOTHER, despite family squabbles and political class distinctions.They, Romeo and Juliet, ""REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER,"" but, due to 'outside interferences,' well...watch the movie or read the book.Thank you for reading my review.",Romeo and Juliet

It is a shame that this film has been largely forgotten. In a post (circa 2000) world we have become a cynical and jaded society on innocent love. With all the rude and sickening garbage polluting the theaters and television screens, it is no wonder that the youth of today scoffs at genuine love in all its honesty and sincerity.Franco Zefferelli directed the film he was born to create and he does it with sheer ambition, beautiful direction combined with stunning visuals. This is the kind of movie that should inspire any director regardless of the genre or style they uphold. No director since 1968 has ever captured a more touching and viscerally poignant film than this. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting are perfectly cast and the cohesion of the plot relies solely on them. They succeed brilliantly. They are just so gorgeous and lovable that we root for them in their plight for acceptance and love.It's a shame that the years haven't acknowledged this beautiful Shakespearean adaptation.

When he did that, I thought, ""Seriously. Get up out of your fetal position and be a man. How can a beautiful girl be in love with that? I understand being devastated but my word..."" A POSITIVE note that I have is that the Love At First Sight sequence, from beginning to end (when they finally part ways from the Capulet backyard after exchanging vows) was even better than the remake.

For many years, so-called scholars shunned this film version of the famous play, but it has done more to introduce Shakespeare to the masses than all the scholars combined. It is a feast for the eyes in terms of costume, sets, and casting. The music is superb and sweet. The editing of lines and scenes does nothing to affect the story: In the film, Romeo does not kill Paris; Lady Montague does not die; the apothecary who sells Romeo the poison is absent; Friar John is not shown being quarantined in a house because of a plague outbreak; the Capulet servant does not ask Romeo to read the invitation to the Capulet feast, and many lines of dialogue are deleted. Yet, nothing deleted has affected the outcome of the story nor the validity of the plot. The casting of teenagers to play teenagers is so refreshing.

61,zensixties,Zeffirelli's Quintessential Version! Every Aspect Excellent!,10,5 May 2003,"This is THE must see version of Romeo and Juliet. Zeffirelli's 1968 masterpiece stars 17-year-old Leonard Whiting and 15-year-old Olivia Hussey with great music by Nino Rota. Filmed ""on location"" in Italy this version also has the fingerprints of the 1960s all over it, from moddish long hair, the debut of Michael York as Tybalt, John McEnery as Mercutio, the lush balcony scenes, the nude scene, and an emotional intensity throughout. McEnery brings just the right comic touch to the comi-tragedy and screenwriters Franco Brusati, Maestro D'Amico, and Zeffirelli keep true to Shakespeare with a take on the story that's easily accessible to a wide audience, thereby making this one of the most popular films of the '60s.Especially effective is the ambiguity of intent of the Tybalt-Mercutio duel, and the overall editing of dialogue just enough to keep it succinct and believable yet retain the poetic and philosophical virtuosity of the playwright's playwright. The music is used effectively and as it rises during the love scenes it's a manipulation that's an enhancement to rather than distraction from the emotion--a rare successful pull-off of this. And that balcony scene is extraordinary, the lush dark atmosphere, Romeo's giddiness, Juliet's beauty...I believed it.Milo O'Shea (who later played the Judge in ""The Verdict"") does a believable Friar Laurence and Robert Stephens (I)(with a long list of Shakespearian roles to his name) an intensely serious Prince of Verona. It's hard not to fall in love with Olivia (watch for her new film role as Mother Theresa).Some bits of trivia: Before 1968 Romeo and Juliet was not generally taught in US high schools and this film's popularity changed all that as most of you reading this had it in high school. Michael York turned down the role of Oliver in Love Story--one may read into this he felt it was a poor man's Romeo and Juliet...just a thought. Also Olivia Hussey briefly dated Prince Charles. And here's the clincher: Paul McCartney got the original offer to play Romeo. I'm glad he turned it down, as Whiting is perfect here. And for those who wonder, the story did not originate in historical fact, though one may wish it so. The story came from mythical legend starting in 5th century Greece, later evolving into ""The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet"" translated into English in 1562 by Arthur Brooke and originally written about 1530 by Luigi da Porto., 'til Shakespeare got a hold of it (circa 1594) and breathed into it the life that will last as long as humanity does most probably.This towers over the 1st film version with a 34-year-old Norma Shearer and a 43-year-old Leslie Howard, and as for the 1996 mess sorry guys; American accents, present day gang violence, over-the-top overacting, LA locales, and Leonard DiCaprio do not great Shakespearean tragedy make. This 1968 one is the one to see over and over.",Romeo and Juliet
62,SHB_73,A faithful adaption of a classic love story,10,13 August 2007,"William Shakespeare's Tale of Romeo and Juliet comes to life in this wonderful movie which is superbly acted by then unknown actors Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting as the famous lovers. The story takes place in Verona, Italy between two rival families:The Capulets and Montagues, unfortunately Romeo who is a Montague falls for Juliet, a Capulet. They are so in love that they are secretly married but the families have so much hatred for each other which results in sword fights that bring deaths to both sides and Results in Romeo being exiled. Not knowing Juliet is married her father betrothed her to another man. With the help of a Friar(Milo O'Shea)Juliet devises a plan to reunite with her love Romeo, But the plan goes horribly wrong with disastrous consequences. Franco Zeffirelli's movie is wonderful from beginning to end and even though we know what happens at the end of this tragic love story, it can still be emotional and heartbreaking. Never was their a tale of woe, than that of Juliet and her Romeo. I highly recommend this movie.",Romeo and Juliet
63,larrysmile1,"""Where be these enemies? -- Capulet, Montague.... All are punished.""",9,4 April 2002,"There is no doubt that this is a first class ""A"" list work of Shakespeare's timeless classic.  The believability comes from director Franco Zeffirelli's casting of real teenagers to play Romeo and Juliet.  Olivia Osuna (movie name: Hussey) was a 16 year old Argentine born actress and Leonard Whiting was 17 years old during the filming.  The second item of praise is the on-location filming in Verona, Italy. Thirdly, the costumes were very well done!  Juliet looked so beautiful that any Romeo would instantly fall in love with her and her long black hair! I followed the story dialogue from the Romeo and Juliet text as the movie unwound.  Many of the long dialogue sequences were cut short.  Usually four or six lines of dialogue were spoken by the actors when Shakespeare actually wrote upwards of 20 lines of dialogue, at times.  Sometimes, two - four lines from the beginning of a passage were spoken then skipping to the last two lines before changing speakers.  Sometimes, movie dialogue began in the middle of one of Shakespeare's passages.  Of course, the movie remained true to the ""famous"" and well-known lines, as in the balcony scene and final death scenes, for example.Michael York was a solid anchor in this film.  Of course, he went on to become a more famous actor than Olivia or Leonard.Friar Lawrence's dialogue was sharply cut as well as the dialogue of Juliet's nurse.  Compared to the original Shakespeare text, the speaking parts of the parents was minimal, as well as other characters. 
Director Zeffirelli mainly focused his camera and dialogue on the interactions between Romeo and Juliet with the exception of the fine sword fighting scenes in the courtyard of Verona!  The most beautiful scene of the film is when Romeo awakens in Juliet's bed chamber and gazes upon her sleeping face.  This was beautiful and romantic. It showed the pleasure of a young man with his virginal bride following their ""honeymoon"" night.  The cinematography was outstanding!  However, I always find fault with actors whom mumble their lines and speak in such low volume that does not take into consideration the usual background noise levels in which the viewing public actually experiences these films.  For all directors, it may be ""all quiet on the set"" when you film, but, it's not all quiet in the room where the public views your film.  Teach your actors how to enunciate their words and not to speak too fast or drop off the ends of their sentences.  Low volume is not effective nor artistic when the viewer has to wonder -- ""what did they say?""  One has to tape this film and watch it a number of times following along with the text dialogue to appreciate the spoken words.  American Movie Classics did not broadcast this film with closed captions, sorry to say.",Romeo and Juliet
64,fullonrobotchubby,Hard to bite your thumb at,6,17 August 2006,"I vaguely remember this movie. I saw it my freshman year of high school in class. Of all of Shakespeare's works, Romeo and Juliet has always been the play that most intrigued me, and I have a feeling that if I watched this particular adaptation these days, now that I have a much much MUCH better grasp on how to read/perform Shakespeare, I'd probably like it even more and give it more stars. Since this isn't the case quite yet, there are two things about this movie that stick out the furthest for me. One is the nudity, which is because of my hormone driven age at the time, and the other is Michael York. The man who in the future would play Basil Exposition in three Austin Powers flicks plays the proud and short-tempered Tybalt here, and he's perfect for the part physically, intellectually, and most of all, vocally. My favorite scene has always been the climactic third act, when Romeo's free-spirited friend Mercutio dies at the hands of Tybalt, causing Romeo to quickly seek revenge. This film stages the action wisely.1968 was such a great year for movies. It brought us this Oscar contender for Best Picture, the Flowers for Algernon adaptation Charly, the first Mel Brooks film The Producers, Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey, and the reason the rating system exists in the world of film Night of the Living Dead. I promise all of you, every single one of these films will get more love from me than the actual Best Picture winner of '68, that Dickensian musical crapfest Oliver! Of the five actual nominees for Best Picture, so far I think Romeo and Juliet was robbed.",Romeo and Juliet
65,RockyMtnVideo,"This is ""the"" film version to watch. The others all pale in comparison.",10,28 February 2016,"I'll make this relatively short. Others provide far more detailed reviews, but this has always held special meaning for me, so I finally decided to weigh in with some comments.I saw this when it was originally released in the US, while I was a high school aged teen. It is difficult to describe the depth of its impact on me, mostly because it was such a perfect film. Zeffirelli's genius abounds, in so many different ways, but aside from the genius of the film script (involving more than just him), by far, the primary thing that separates it from the long list of other ""attempts"" to film this story, was the casting of two actors in their early-to-mid teens (the proper age for the two protagonists), instead of using twenty (or in some film variants, thirty) year old actors in those roles, as had been done in so many previous efforts. Having actors in other films who were sometimes twice the appropriate age for those roles, attempting to pull off those performances, simply never rang true.Second only to the casting, was the absolutely perfect ""tone"" of the entire film. Filmed in Verona, where the play was obviously set, plus the cinematography, and then the unbelievably perfect score, all facilitated its translation from its original stage-based home, to what is a true film masterpiece.It is the actors' (appropriately) youthful innocence, and that perfect tone, that make this depiction of the tragedy stand out, from other efforts. It is also what makes it so ""rewatchable"". You can't help falling in love with them again, in each viewing, as you watch them (so innocently) fall in love with each other. And, when that seminal moment plays out against the backdrop of the soulful rendition of ""What is Youth"", the ""hook is set"", and despite the inevitable train wreck that is coming, it's just impossible to walk away, because you are (yet again) simply too invested in these two teens' tragic journey.To be fair about the age comment, I should say that I'm not blind to other film interpretations, which have utilized age-appropriate actors, e.g. Luhrmann's take on R&J. But the varied attempts (like his) to take the play, and place it in some bizarrely modern setting, have never really worked for me. It just feels ""awkward"" (like a square peg in a round hole). The only time that I have been comfortable with some R&J inspired story is when someone simply takes the basic theme, and retools it entirely, e.g. the classic, and equally tragic ""West Side Story"" being a perfect example.In short, this is simply one of the most moving, and beautiful films that you could ever hope to see, regardless of whether you are, or are not, into Shakespearean classics. And it would be difficult to imagine anyone ever doing a better job of translating this play into film. (For insight into Zeffirelli's scripting choices, I would highly recommend reading film-222's IMDb review. See: http://www.imdb.com/user/ur5222822/).",Romeo and Juliet

In the beginning, I didn't really get the majesty of the film until I re-watched it today, and oh my god, what a film! What really makes this movie work is one fact: Zeffirelli understands the material well! The reason why so many adaptations before this one failed, is because they were casted poorly, but here, every single role, done to the last damn extra was casted correctly!

The teens of the time fell in love with both Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, and the film was quite popular.  I remember some ""bad press"" that the film got for casting such young, immature leading actors in the principal roles.  When I saw the film as a youth, I thought that the reviewers didn't know what they were talking about.I have just watched the DVD version, and (after living through more different versions of R&J than I care to discuss) I am amazed at the beauty of this production.  The young leads are totally sincere in their roles. The sense of period is exquisite, and the cinematography simply beautiful. This time around, I was very much taken by Zefirelli's ability to preserve the beauty of individual faces in group settings, such as the Capulet banquet scene, and his incredible use of color.Watching this film roughly 32 years after seeing it the first time convinced me (again) that Zeffirelli knew what he was doing.

In 1968, most of the kids my age then (17) were still innocent, or as Better Midler said 15 years ago, ""Some of the things kids know now, I didn't learn until I was 35!""The movie is gorgeously photographed, as is typical of Franco Zeffirelli's photography. Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting were excellent as two youthful lovers unscarred by any pain. They were, after all, only 15, and 15, in Shakespeare's time, would have girls from good families never even leaving the house alone. This is what innocence looks like (for those who never grew up with it), and LOOKED like, even in the '60s. It wasn't until the '80s that innocence began to fade.

As a 13 yr old I was not pleased and even fell asleep. I rented it a few years later and loved it! I thought it was a great movie with lovely costumes and two extraordinary leads.This movie is set in Renaissance Verona. Romeo is an exceptionally handsome young man played by teenager Leonard Whiting. He is romantically ideal looking for the lover Romeo. I heard Paul McCartney was asked to play this role and thank god he either turned it down or the casting looked elsewhere. Whiting is perfect for the role and had the requisite English accent that defines an actor fit enough to play a Shakespearean role.Juliet. Could Olivia Hussey be any more beautiful? She had the long, thick, black hair and delicate face of an ideal teenage Juliet. I found her and Whiting together so romantic! There have been critics who say Hussey was an annoying, not well acted Juliet. She was a teenager! What teenage girl is not over dramatic about everything! She did a fine job and I must say while I liked Claire Danes as Juliet I much prefer miss Hussey.The story of R & J is so widely known it is pointless to discuss the plot. I think the actors were perfect for the roles and I found the sets and costumes quite impressive especially since it was made in 1968. A great adaptation of Shakespeares tragic young idealistic lovers and I agree with my English teacher from 10 long yrs ago, this is one wonderful movie.",Romeo and Juliet

Most actors for either Juliet or Romeo are extremely not right looking or can't act.Olivia Hussey was very pretty and I would have wished both Leonard and Olivia were given more credit for they truly deserved it.I gave this movie an A. I think if Leonard was acting now as a youth he probably would be a Ben Affleck of our time. I strongly advise you all who are reading this to watch it and buy it. Its actually worth your time.another movie I would recommend would be the 1996 version of Romeo and Juliet starring Leonardo DiCaprio. I know most people judge Leonardo as a horrible actor due to his famous role in Titanic, however truthfully if you seen What is Eating Gilbert Grape? you would know that he is a pretty good actor. Besides the 1996 version was very funny and had a lot of great art direction. No wonder it was directed by the same director of Moulin Rouge.So getting back on track, I urge you all to see both version especially this version. This version was a lavish and eloquent movie. The setting was wonderful, a great classic for a Shakespeare version. Basically go see this. It's worth it!I give this movie a 10/10    :)",Romeo and Juliet
79,claudiaeilcinema,Leonard and Olivia,8,13 November 2007,"This was the first time we actually saw the teenage love Shakespeare intended. Years and years before Leonardo Di Caprio and Clare Danes, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Houssey gave life to the tragic story told in this ancestral tale, revamping it without betraying it, making it accessible to a 60s audience without updating it. Leonard and Olivia were so beautiful that Shakespeare became trendy again and I don't mean any disrespect by it, I'm simply stating a fact. The real, stunning, dusty locations, the costumes, the faces, the music made the whole thing a totally new Shakespearen experience. Remember than the biggest screen adaptation of this play had been with the forty something Leslie Howard and Norma Shearer in those roles. Here everything reeked of youth underlining the tragedy in the most cinematic way. Another important point is to confirm that in 2007 the film still feels young and fresh.

However, for the medium of cinema, this is about as good as it gets for the Bard. Romeo & Juliet brings a life and urgency to a play that often comes across as too long for film. The acting throughout is absolutely first rate and it's hard to figure out what scene is the best. In addition, the sets and costumes are terrific. Even in our glib Moulin-Rouge era, it's virtually impossible not to be taken in by the opulent beauty and passion of this movie. I first saw this work when I was 11 in 1974. Since I had not seen or read the play, it was even more exciting to watch, and it's remained the standard by which I measure all cinematic renditions of Shakespeare. I saw it again last night, and it still stands.",Romeo and Juliet
83,mvanhoore,"Great design, pity about old Bill",7,18 February 2014,"I watched this movie without much expectation. First of all I don't care very much for Bill Shakespeare. Of course he's one of the most brilliant people ever to put words on paper but his wordplay is dated and overdone.But I must admit that I like this version of the famous story by Zefirelli. The design is beautiful, there's good use of colors and I think great attention had been paid to make medieval Verona look as realistic as possible.There has been a lot of critic for not using more experienced and better actors than Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey. I think it's a good thing that finally Romeo and Juliet are played by actors that have the right age for these roles. The love between these two adolescents shines brightly on the screen, so much that you wonder if these two young actors were in love outside the scenes too. And as I said before I don't care much for the bombastic language by Shakespeare so for me to see actors who are believable in their roles is more important than a Romeo and Juliet about 30 years of age who speak the lines with more feeling.It's a pity that in this film Zefirelli misses the chance to update the dialogues for a modern era. After all the cultural revolutions of the sixties this is missed chance and for me more important than the naked bottom of Romeo or the shown breasts (although only for a split-second) of Juliet.And I wonder if I am the only one but when the bard starts singing during the party at the house of the Capulets I had to think about Oliver!, the movie of the same year by Carol Reed. The song could easily fit into that movie and is really out of place in a movie about medieval Verona.So I sit out the dialogues, enjoyed the great look of this film and like in all films bases on iconic stories was a bit disappointed that the director choose not make an alternative ending which leaves you surprised in your chair.",Romeo and Juliet
84,stjohn1253,Impetuous Fire; Ice and Desire,9,23 August 2016,"In homage to youthful impetuousness, this author will be brief.Ziffirelli brings to life a classical painting of young love and aggression with his interpretation of ROMEO AND JULIET. To see this film is to enter an art museum that magically animates into 16th century Verona.Few parts of this film flag. For example, consider the authenticity of the fight scenes. Typically, camera cuts fail to hide the ""acting"" of the combatants, but here you aren't distracted by thoughts of ""Well, it IS only a movie."" The editor knows when to have you look away; you can enjoy the action with no suspension of disbelief.Casting is virtually flawless. All characters fit their roles, especially the titular leads, Whiting (Romeo) and Hussey (Juliet). So also McEnery (Mercutio); York (Tybalt); and O'Shea (Friar Laurence). The rest are merely fantastic.This review isn't all praise, however, as the nude scene could easily have been cut. Some things are best left to the imagination.In conclusion, today's films don't rise to this level. Ziffirelli took a century's old story, set it in period, and absolutely absorbed the audience's attention with the touch of an artist. How the bar lowered to the CGI baseness now accepted as the norm in the film industry boggles the mind.Can it be that things really were better in the ""good old days""?",Romeo and Juliet

86,Roemer,Why you should see this movie,9,6 May 2001,"Juliet is 13. Almost 14. She is not, as in all other portrayals, a young adolescent. She is a _child_. A child, in an adult body, with lots of hormones going around.This is the only film that captures this right. Juliet is a child, captured in her family, the ethics and social rules of her times, and her own puberty. When she cries, you hear a little child crying. It is the same girl that cannot control her passions for her loved one. And these passions are not only, simple, pure, holy love. No sir. The girl is 13, Romeo is not much older. We're talking of the strongest puppy-love in history, together with pure, uncontrolled and undirected teenager lust. Did not Shakespeare write that Romeo's flaming and endless love flipped within a second from one young girl (Rosalina) to another (Juliet)? He understood teenager love a lot better than most directors of this play do!Not to say that, in this film, their love isn't _real_. Man, I've never seen so much chemistry on the screen! Forget Danes and diCaprio. They are much better actors but they lose this one. By miles. Millions of miles. But Hussey and Whiting's love is not just that. It is not just chemistry. Not plain ""love"", this ""pure thing"" where everybody seems to think R&J is about. Forget it! It is teenage confusion, depression, rebellion, it is being a child and an adult at the same time, it is something they do not understand, it is clumsiness, hardly uncontrollable lust, it is very well possible that this love would turn into pure hatred if it had had some time to develop ... it is, simply said, the most complex and simple thing at the same time. And it's all there, in the portrayal of these two very young actors in the amazing direction by Zeffirelli. (Of whom I heard that he roamed the planet to find the actors he needed.)Maybe the best advertisement is that I personally was not attracted to either one of the lovers. Which is usually the easiest way to make a screen-love convincing - and often the only way.This films is, in spite of its gorgeous but convincing settings, brilliant camera work and beautiful (though dated) costumes and art-direction, very imperfect in many small ways. Olivia Hussey fake whines once too often. There are strange holes in Shakespeare's text. The end of the famous Mab monologue is too melodramatic. But all this helps to make you realize how _real_ this all feels. How every inch of your body tenses with emotion. If everything had been perfect, it would have been slick and not half as moving.Take, for example, the scene in the tomb. In Romeo + Juliet (1996), they use a million candles. Nice effect. People remember that. It is not half the impact that the dead bodies, in different states of decay, simple, gruesome and beautiful, in this film have. They made a good decision by leaving out the fight between Romeo and Paris in the tomb (a very common cut, by the way) and focus on the deadly love  scene between the dead only. Zeffirelli did the most perfect job by focusing only on what Romeo and Juliet is all about: love. What a masterpiece.For never was there more beauty in woeThan in this version of Juliet, and her Romeo.",Romeo and Juliet

I'm trying to get a singing career off the ground and I'm looking all over the place for the theme song -- not the one that came out later, but the version that that minstrel sang during the banquet ""What is a youth?/impetuous fire etc."" Some people didn't like the omission of Romeo killing Paris but I didn't mind; I could see that Zeffirelli was trying to make Romeo a more sympathetic character for 20th-century moviegoers. Michael York (a fabulous Tybalt) wrote about it in his autobiography, ""Accidentally on Purpose,"" that ""It was the first movie in which I entered the scene from the crotch upwards.""

Olivia Hussey (Death On The Nile; It; Psycho IV: The Beginning; etc.,) shines as sweet Juliet, Leonard Whiting's (Frankenstein: The True Story; The Legend Of Young Dick Turpin; Rachel's Man; etc.,) portrayal of young Romeo is unparalleled and of course Michael York (Logan's Run; The Island Of Dr. Moreau; Austin Powers; etc.,) is outstanding as fiesty Tybalt.  But the true shining star in this film is  the delightful, Ms. Pat Heywood (Who Slew Auntie Roo?; Root Into Europe; The Secret Garden; etc.,)  who steals the screen with each moment she graces it.She plays Juliet's Nurse and does so with such power, whimsy and conviction that you simply must love her.  Pat Heywood gave the commonly droll Nurse character life and vibrance I have yet to see in a performance of this play live or filmed.  The scene where she goes to the church to meet Romeo is absolutely side-splitting!My sole complaint with this film was that there was a bit of trimming done to the original script.  Some of the dialogue was cut down, but only true, hard-core Shakespeare fans would likely notice.  You've tried the rest? Then watch the BEST!Concerning the ages of the stars:  I include this mainly as a side note, for it's been my experience that there is always some confusion, question and disagreement concerning the age of the young stars.  Here is their birth information in hopes of settling any debates.  Hussey was born April 17th 1951 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Leonard Whiting was born June 30th 1950 in London, England, UK and Michael York was nearly ten years their senior (May 27th, 1942 - in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, England, UK).
Not that it's ever been a debate -- as far as I know it hasn't -- but I do not know Ms. Heywood's birthday...Just for the record :)",Romeo and Juliet
89,Bloodfordracula,Franco Zeffirelli's Masterpiece,10,9 January 2003,"Not only is 'Romeo and Juliet' Franco Zeffirelli's best film but it is without question the greatest Shakespeare film ever made and one of the five greatest films of all time. Every shot in this film is a work of art. Nino Rota's score is so powerful and hauntingly beautiful. The performances are excellent but it is Franco Zeffirelli's magic touch that makes this film so amazing. Zeffirelli brings a sense of urgency to every movement and every word spoken. This movie has to be one of the most underrated films ever made. If you love this movie watch Franco Zeffirelli's 1973 film 'Brother Sun, Sister Moon' - this film is almost as great as 'Romeo and Juliet' and it is just as powerful and beautiful.",Romeo and Juliet
90,Goombalock,A perfect adaptation of Shakesperes best!,7,9 March 2011,"Does this REALLY need an introduction?

91,timbasa77,Fantastic,10,13 July 2005,"Easily the best Shakespeare film in history, mainly because it stays so true to what Shakespeare wrote and was undoubtedly his vision, yet is undeniably fresh and relevant and affecting, despite its Renaissance setting. It feels more modern and current than the soulless bluster of Baz Luhrmann's effort. Whosoever says Whiting and Hussey are anything short of fantastic as Romeo and Juliet needs to reconsider how they want Shakespeare acted. Do you want dramatic bluster and fist waving (which Hamlet specifically cautions against) or true raw emotion and feeling? These actors, mostly because they were so inexperienced, couldn't be more natural and true to their characters every step of the way. You truly believe that they are in love and it's a legitimate love, no just ""crazy teens."" And the rest of the cast - Jesus H. Christ! They're all fantastic. The Friar and Nurse were obscenely perfect, becoming among the most endearing characters ever filmed, and of course John McEnery is the best, most pathos-laden Mercutio ever, all stage, screen, TV, etc. renditions included. Michael York is a fabulous Tybalt, menacing, arrogant, headstrong, cruel, but ultimately sympathetic. Tybalt is after all just a petulant child - he's no evil tyrant, just a misguided bully, who certainly doesn't deserve to die. I love that his killing of Mercutio is accidental and that he seems to show remorse for it. Even the Prince is really damn good, with his last lines leaving an absolutely chilling impression on the audience. All are punish-ed! A must see.",Romeo and Juliet
92,film-222,"Utter beauty, Expert adaptation of literary work to screen.",10,5 February 2016,"No need for me to add another rave review on the perfect casting of the teenage Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting, the authentic, colorful costumes, the top-notch supporting cast, the deft camera work.Instead, I learned about excellent screen writing from this film. After being enthralled by this movie, I fetched a copy of the play to check the scenes: I found that Zefirelli expertly cut any dialogue that was largely exposition. Where on the stage dialogue is needed to describe what happened, on screen one can show it visually (""show don't tell""). Zefirelli retained the essential words that the characters would need to say to communicate and just cut the exposition. He also cut lines that somewhat repeat other lines (which made me read Shakespeare's words a lot more closely and realize the bard was sometimes a bit verbose), following another screen writing adage to cut anything that doesn't necessarily move the story forward. Yes, some famous soliloquies get cut, but in filmmaking, sometimes you have to ""kill your baby"" no matter how precious. In terms of moving the story forward, nothing was missed, nothing was excessive. If anyone wants to take a good lesson in screen adaptation of literary works, learn from this.And I would like to give my response to those who thought the crying was a bit over the top. Well, Zefirelli not only cast age-appropriate actors, but he also set the film in Italy, where it's supposed to be! Romeo and Juliet and their families are Italian (and so is Zefirelli), so I think it perfectly makes sense for them to emote with great noise and abandon. :) Flawless film that is more than perfection, but a visionary work of art.",Romeo and Juliet
93,edmund-marlowe,The greatest film yet made,10,18 June 2014,"This is as near perfection as I can conceive a film coming. Though I have limited toleration of reseeing films, I have seen this one about a dozen times. I am still in awe of its beauty and invariably streaming with tears at its ending.If aspiring to make a stupendous film about love, it does of course help to choose a story standing so high above others of its kind that it has become a byword for romance. As one should be able to (but cannot) take for granted with a dialogue already supplied by the greatest playwright ever, it has been only occasionally and gently edited for vocabulary. Zeffirelli made however some very judicious cuts to bring his film down to a suitable length. Gone therefore are most of Romeo's professions of love for Rosaline, his duel with Paris and the little detective story near the end whereby the love story is finally explained to all. At the risk of sounding presumptuous, I would say Zeffirelli improved Shakespeare's story with the removal of these distractions.I found every single actor well-cast and brilliant, the nurse possibly the best. The only fault I found was that Friar Lawrence's incongruous Irish accent grated a little. The lovers were suitably beautiful, which again one might hope one could take for granted with such a topic, but cannot. It is extraordinary that Zeffirelli was the first film director to have the sense to cast teenagers in the leading roles, as Shakespeare obviously intended. Both story and dialogue are otherwise patently absurd. Not only Romeo and Juliet, but also their companions impart perfectly the innocence, passion, swagger, spontaneity, charm and eros of Renaissance youth.The mild but exquisite eroticism of the bedroom scene was essential; there can be no moment when beautiful nudity is more strongly called for than in the sole such scene of a film celebrating young physically-inspired love. I only wish Zeffirelli could have gone further despite our puritanical society. It is a particular shame as he had the sense and good taste to pay homage to the beauty of both sexes.The period-perfect Italian settings and ravishing costumes are so authentic and beautiful that many of the scenes look exactly like Renaissance paintings, in other words some of the most beautiful images ever made. For me, however, the crème de la crème is the one of these visual feasts where we are simultaneously treated to a youth's singing of the superbly apt theme song, What is a Youth?, itself the most beautiful song I know of.Edmund Marlowe, author of Alexander's Choice, a modern tragedy of forbidden love, www.amazon.com/dp/1481222112",Romeo and Juliet
94,pixienat,Beautiful & Amazing!,10,16 April 2005,"There are few things on this planet that bring me joy and at the same time sadness. Romeo and Juliet is one of them. No other movie besides this have I felt so much over fictitious characters in my entire life. I have been told and learned that love is beautiful and when you see your soul mate it is magical, but I learned myself what true love is. I was so tied into this epic of a movie that I told myself it was real, this wasn't a movie. It felt real, as if I was watching it in live action not just on a screen. Everything was perfect in this movie. The clothing made it more realistic, the actors were selected as if by God for these parts, the music and the scenery. the scenery was just breath taking and made everything imaginable. If Shakespeare as alive today, I think he would be very, very fond of this movie. In fact, I think he would love it and be very proud. Romeo and Juliet is a play which can be extorted in different ways to suit the directors need, Zeffirelli took this play and created a in-living- colour masterpiece. I am so jealous that my father, who was a freshman in high school when this came out, was able to on a field trip go to Hollywood to see this in theaters. This is my favourite movie for many reasons, one of them being it makes me bawl so hard I practically melt away my face, it makes me understand love in a different view (i'm fifteen.) and I have fallen in love with Shakespeare's work. I think of Shakespeare is a shear genius. How could someone think of a story like this? I know I couldn't, could you? I think the direct quite,""For never was a story of more woe, than this of Juliet and her Romeo."" sums up everything perfectly.",Romeo and Juliet
95,hmghosthost,Stunning,10,15 March 2006,"This movie came out the year I was born. I finally saw it when I was 6, and I was so attracted to Leonard Whiting I felt heat flashes in my chest and face - at six years old! I had no idea back then that the reason I felt that way was because I was gay. So naturally this movie rates as one of my all time favorites. (I think that experience pretty much proved that people don't choose to be gay!) But aside from getting a stirring in my loins at the sight of Romeo, this movie has much to be praised for. The settings, costumes, music and locations were all of Academy Award-winning quality. The actors reveled in their roles of this arguably most famous of love stories.I was thrilled to see Olivia Hussey go on to play Mary in the now famous mini series ""Jesus of Nazareth"".",Romeo and Juliet
96,KatherineGM,"Outstanding, but get the tissues ready!",9,14 November 2011,"We are studying Romeo and Juliet in English, and we had to watch and compare this version to the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. I own the 1996 version because I am a huge Leo fan, but I must admit this version is much better. The best things about this film are the two outstanding teenage leads, expertly picked by Zeffirelli. 17-year-old Leonard Whiting is convincing and emotional as Romeo, not to mention very good looking, and 15-year old Olivia Hussey positively shines as the vulnerable Juliet. They have amazing chemistry and are really believable as the tragic star-crossed lovers. In the 1996 version, Leo is very very good as Romeo, but Claire Danes is underwhelming and the role is unsuited to her. However in this version the romance truly seems real and not wooden, and their portrayal of the doomed couple is out of this world. The other aspects of the film are excellent as well, such as the scenery, setting and costumes which stay true to Shakespeares original play. The supporting cast are brilliant, with Michael York as a chilling Tybalt, and a comedic turn from Pat Heywood as the nurse. In conclusion, this is a classic, and you must see it. Have your tissues ready for the end, you will need them.",Romeo and Juliet
97,rsd_anon,"Great Movie, but terrible audio (spoken lines and background orchestra)",6,11 June 2016,"I haven't seen this movie for 40 years. I had always remembered it as a great movie. I had been waiting for a Blu-ray version, but I finally gave up and decided to see the DVD version.The movie was a mixed bag for me. I still love the sets and most of the acting. The audio, however, was so bad that it seriously distracted from the movie. If the audio was equal to the sets and acting, I would raise my rating to a 9. As it is, I can only give it a 6.There were three things that were particularly bad. First the speaking parts seemed to have all the bad quality of a dubbed movie. It appears that the actors were all speaking in English, but the soundtrack sounded as if it was all dubbed. All of the speaking parts reminded me of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". The second problem (for me) was the overly emotive sobbing of Juliet throughout many of her scenes. Again, it was if the scenes were filmed and then the parts were spoken later in a recording studio. Maybe this is the way all movies are made, but it was bad enough to make me cringe each time Juliet started the sobbing. The third problem was the use of orchestra music in the background of many scenes. This may just be the norm for 1968-era movies, but it now sounds wrong.",Romeo and Juliet
98,Jim-947,This is a wonderful movie.,10,12 March 2008,"Olivia Hussey was beautiful and utterly believable as the teenage love interest. Michael York was chilling as Tybalt. The sword fight scene between Michael York and John McEnery as Mercutio was wonderfully comic. They seemed like two good old boys razzing each other. It was believable.I feel I had forgotten what love was like. I must admit this film was so beautiful I could not keep my eyes dry.Today it seems like it is all about boob jobs, penis enlargement pills and Viagra. We've lost sight of what's important. The Elizabethan's knew something about love people today too often overlook. Shakespeare instructs us. We should pay attention.",Romeo and Juliet
99,emee4real,Awesome!!! Simply Awesome!!!,10,18 April 2007,"What else can I say? This movie was simply fantastic I found myself watching it over and over again. Despite the fact that sometimes the dialog was not exactly the way Shakespeare himself put it (i. e. in the opening scene with the servants) the acting was great and completely convincing! We see 2 beautiful people-Whiting and Hussey-looking like Romeo and Juliet themselves as their creator put them. I also doff my hat for Michael York; he was absolutely brilliant as Tybalt and I must say that my liking for York has gone up several notches with this movie. Bruce Robinson was also pretty good as Benvolio. Mercutio had energy, wit and a rough common sense and John McEnery projects them all. There may be several differences between the movie and Shakespeare's play, but it doesn't take anything away from the acting and the movie in general. So I give it a 10 out of 10. Somebody says he prefers the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes to this one. My advice is-DON'T WATCH THAT VERSION, IT'S TERRIBLE!! This version has it all.",Romeo and Juliet

It's truly excellent, and there's really nothing more to add.  The characters are perfect, lovely and young and innocent, yet showing a mature strength as Shakespeare had intended. Olivia Hussey is positively the epitome of beauty and grace, so that I'm surprised she never had any more major movies known to date.  Leonard Whiting too had an innocent charm, and still retained a boyish cuteness. The background setting of Italy was perfection in itself, and the director Franco Zeffirelli was a genius when he created this version.  Arguably the best R & J movie ever, a must see highly recommended. :)",Romeo and Juliet

You'd be doing yourself and your students a huge disfavor by doing so. Quite simply, this is the only version of the movie needed. It's flawless. Think about it. Here's a movie that is nearly 50 years old, yet is still imminently watchable by teenagers today.The main characters are all perfectly cast, with most in the prime of their acting careers. Whiting and Hussey, in particular, are stunning. They act well beyond their years. The dialogue is perfect, the sword-fighting scenes are incredible even by today's standards, and the chemistry between all of the characters is just so easy to pick up on.

Yes, I know there are great Shakespearian actors in the world. However, they were teenagers when they made the film and it was made from the heart of a teenager which is what Shakespeare had in mind.It is so utterly regretful that Leonard Whiting never soared to great fame. I wonder if he was panned as a ""has been"" after the film or simply ignored.I saw the movie at the box office in 1968 when I remember not a dry eye in the theatre.

107,oaktree_pf,"A part from the music and the photography, a great deception.",5,25 August 2000,"Everyone told that since adore Shakespeare's play and know all about it, i should watch this film.  I got a great deception.  The music is really the only thing that's worth it. The film has an awful lot of innaccuracies and the majority of the cast is awful.  The only one who seems to know something about acting is Juliet, although she has got some scenes ('O Romeo, Romeo, wherefor...') which are terrible.  She fails in the attempt to lact like a 14 year old girl but she is over childish which girls of that age aren't. Romeo, Tybalt and Juliet say their lines with a terrible lack of passion which makes the spectator unable to feel their despeartion, frustration and many other emotions present in Shakespear's play.Overall a film not worth seeing.  If u really want to see real passion, despeartion and  true emotions,watch 'Roemo and Juliet' by Baz Luhrman.",Romeo and Juliet

109,ToPassTheTime99,The version of R&J that everyone should watch!,10,30 April 2021,"Of all the Romeo and Juliet films that exist, this version is the one you should watch!The directing:
This was the movie that introduced me to the magic of Franco Zeffirelli. I absolutely adore that Zeffirelli pays careful attention to every aspect of filmmaking. I also love that he adds so much sensitivity to all of his films. There was a rating that said that Franco Zeffirelli had two specialties, one of them being Shakespeare, and I can't say I was surprised to find that out. As an actress myself (Theatre) I could tell that he worked very closely with everyone to ensure that they would meet the demands of Shakespeare's work. So brava to Zeffirelli, he never disappoints!The casting/acting:
I am very pleased that teenagers were cast for every character that's supposed to be a teenager. Especially the leads. Unlike the 1936 version, whose leads were way too old for their parts. In my opinion, Olivia Hussey was perfectly cast as Juliet. She looked the part when it came to youth, naivety, and innocence, and she was successful at reflecting all of the above in her performance. Not to mention that Olivia Hussey was absolutely gorgeous and mesmerizing! Truly lives up to the line ""Forswear it sight. For i ne'er saw true beauty till this night."" As for Leonard Whiting as Romeo, who's supposed a little older than Juliet, I liked that he also added innocence to his performance even though he did look a few years older than Juliet. But what I absolutely loved about Leonard's acting is that he played Romeo as a young, innocent, nervous and love-struck teenager who's experiencing new love. Despite him playing a Shakespeare character, which often requires over-the-top acting choices, I felt like his performance was authentic.Overall, I was truly impressed with everyone's acting in this film! Not only was the cast able to perfect the language required for Shakespeare, but I never felt like they lacked energy. I was especially impressed by the fact that, despite not being able to fully understand old English, I knew exactly what was going on thanks to the actors' facial expressions and body language.The music:
Oh I absolutely loved the music! It was romantic and dramatic which is what you need for a romantic movie. I think my favorite score has to be the music that played during the waltz.The choreography:
Which brings me to my next point. The choreography! I am not lying when I say that the waltz was my favorite scene in the entire film. The choreography for the waltz was romantic and sweet, which I thought was appropriate for the scene and enhanced the meaning of Romeo's lines. And the rest of the choreography was definitely entertaining to watch. It was so fun that It Made me wish I were dancing with them.Award winning Cinematography and Costume design:
It's important to note that this movie won 2 Oscars. One for it's cinematography and another for its costume design. And rightly so. Considering that it was a movie made in the 60s and technology wasn't quite advanced, the cinematography was darn good. Everybody and everything looked absolutely radiant. And the costumes! They were definitely accurate for the setting of the play (film in this) and I loved how the capulets wore their house's colors (oranges, reds and yellows/golds), just as the Montagues wore theirs (blues, greens, blacks, whites and greys).As nothing in this world is perfect, this film had its weaknesses. I'll start with my opinions on things other people pointed out.Yes it's true that some lines were missing. However, I personally did not miss them? I think the only line I truly wished they had kept was this one: ""it is the East and Juliet if the sun. Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon, who is already sick and pale with grief"" and it wasn't even the entire line that was missing, just that portion. I do understand why they didn't keep it though, they didn't feel it was important. It was probably the same with the other missing lines. As far as I can remember, all of the important and iconic lines were said, even if they weren't said in their entirety the iconic portions were said.And yes they are missing the market scene where Romeo reads the list of Capulet's party guests and fight between Paris and Romeo.... but honestly, I don't think they were important? I certainly didn't miss them.But I think my biggest critique was the amount of sexual passion/tension shown in the balcony scene. I get that it's normal for teenagers' hormones to go crazy and I'm not trying to be a prude, but I worried about the accuracy. Romeo and Juliet was written in a time where teenagers, particularly young ladies, weren't even allowed to go out without a chaperone so it was very unlikely that teenagers in this particular setting would behave so ""wildly."" I honestly appreciated that part in the ball scene where we can literally feel the intensity behind R&J's first kiss through the screen. I feel like their interactions during the balcony scene could've been limited to a make out session and hand/face touching. They could've at least put a limit until the scene where R&J are seen together in bed. After that scene it would definitely be unrealistic for them to keep their hands to themselves haha.But despite these weaknesses, this film was truly a masterpiece and that's why I give it a 10/10.",Romeo and Juliet
110,hyper777,Don't understand the hype,3,12 March 2010,"This film has the potential to be amazing. The darkly romantic scenery is gorgeous, the Renissance-era costumes are beautiful, the supporting actors turn out solid performances, and the leads are two attractive young people that have some acting potential. But they completely fail to deliver. Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey are, on paper, the perfect people to portray these young lovers. But neither of them has the talent or the raw, emotional intensity to carry out that wish. So many scenes that are supposed to be beautiful and romantic turn out to be almost laughable, including, in fact, the infamous double suicide at the end. Several people I was watching with started giggling when they saw the overly dramatic sobbing, and that's certainly not the reaction that Franco Zefferelli could have been going for. It had all the right makings of a great movie, but the acting completely threw it off track. I'd advise you to save your time and watch Baz Luhrmann's 1996 version instead; although it's set against a decidedly less picturesque modern backdrop, the acting is fervent and unabashedly unrefined and the ending will make you cry tears of sadness, not laughter.",Romeo and Juliet

I was too young to watch when it came out, and only in the last ten years have I realized how great is this movie. Casting young actors to play the young and impulsive lovers was a little controversial at the time but now seems essential. The scene where they rush like children to kiss each other in the church before their wedding, the pure and unadulterated love they feel for each other...Zeffereli's inspiration brought out the utmost in every scene and actor. And the ball at the Capulets is another beautiful highlight. Enough of the modernistic, revisionist stuff we've been seeing in recent decades. And I pray to God the new version (in production in 2012) stays true to this movie's spirit, and doesn't lay any Hollywood cuteness or smarm on us. Can Hollywood hope to reproduce the graveness and tragedy pronounced by the Prince of Verona when, with Romeo and Juliet's bodies before him, he finally shouts, ""All are punished""?

Not only did he capture Romeo, he captured us into believing he was Romeo. He was outstanding during the Capulet ball, the balcony scene, the duel between Romeo and Tybalt-everything he was seen in during this movie! No better actor for Romeo than Leonard Whiting (not even Leo DiCaprio).Hussey brought out an amazing appearance for Juliet. She is exceptional and worthy of fame! I truly believe she is Juliet Capulet (regardless of what anyone tells me). Claire Danes couldn't measure up to this incredible actress and Olivia is the only actress worthy to have played such a role.

Forget Leonardo DiCaprio and Clare Danes - although Baz Luhrman's version is perhaps the most original take on the story (obviously), no pair have ever been as genuine and believable in the starring roles as Hussey and Whiting. Mere teenagers, the give performances each Academy Award worthy. What they do on screen has to be some of the best acting ever captured be teens on screen (although the dubbing does take away what could have been even more genuine, authentic and realistic).Filmed when Hussey and Whiting were 15 and 17 and released in 1968, this is the one version you have to see, if you only get to see one version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" ever...",Romeo and Juliet

The moment Romeo and Juliet's eyes first meet; it begins. Their yearning for each other and their desire for each other is at a cost that they cannot know. It is an instant instinctual longing and their lives are about to be changed forever. Both of them experience an intensity that is bigger than both of them and they must see each other again. Juliet's nurse, who knows everything takes a bold step to see that her Juliet gets to see her Romeo. The events unfold and sadly, sides are strongly divided even by Juliet's beloved nursemaid. Juliet feels betrayed by her Nurse as she openly describes her disapproval of Romeo. Juliet now knows she no longer can confide in her. The innocence in Juliet striking out on her own to find a way to stay with her Romeo forever is filled with an emotional aching. Nothing will stop her. Experience this movie for yourself.",Romeo and Juliet
120,Tetra123,"The dusty heat of Verona days, 15th century; the lushness of its nights",9,24 May 2007,"To praise Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" as the most engaging, evocative on screen version of the tragedy to date, is unoriginal--but there it is: Most of us had our first experience with this film either in theaters, high school English classes or late summer nights viewing classic film channels. It celebrates the perpetual story of impassioned youth ensnared in ""antico"" social strife; 39 years later, it retains that vivid lushness and energy, still unsurpassed by other versions (as provocative as they may be).While newer films about lost-love themes tug at heartstrings gently...leaving an unsuspecting viewer burdened with emotional wistfulness, Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"" vibrates with the kind of Shakespearean energy that screams for attention. Their story began in a whirlwind and ended in one, the final outcome being the tragic deaths of two 15th century teens. While the viewer is touched by the sad ending, there is no lingering heartbreak or melancholia...only the profound message of a play that's still followed hundreds of years later.Just like Romeo's refusal to be banished gently into the night, so did Zeffirelli refuse to present 15th century Verona as a polished, modern world: The dusty haziness of the Verona days vs. the dewy lushness of its nights, only enhanced the authenticity of this film. While not existing in authentic perfection or including every word of the original play, ""Romeo and Juliet"" was and remains atmospheric perfection: The costumes feel right, the setting feels right and you can almost smell and taste the era. The orange-reds, browns, true purples and cornflower blues define the era, while connecting the film to trends of the late 1960's-early 70's. This film simply generates an aura of distinct feeling, sound and smell: You can almost hear the buzzing of bugs during a warm summer night on the balcony; the smell of hot herbs and grasses surrounding the friar in the field--even the death scene bursts with the immediateness of a summer night, until the final moments of the main characters. Perhaps my fondness of this film is rooted in my own youthful experiences and joie de vivire connections (like that of most of its fans, I suspect) : If it weren't for the bummer outcome of Romeo and Juliet's love, most teens would view this as their first time, head-over-heels-infatuation template---including a dance, moonlight meeting away from the parents and top-secret scheme. It's just a pity Romeo had to chug that poison.9 out of 10 stars for atmosphere, staying power and authenticity.",Romeo and Juliet

I liked most of the actor's performances in this movie (Leonard Whiting, Michael York, Milo O'Shea, and even Keith Skinner, however minor his role was as Balthasar). However, Olivia Hussey drove me insane with her inability to act (her crying sounds SO fake, for a start) and when she and Pat Heywood (the Nurse) laughed it sounded more like two witches cackling horribly, and I found the Prince (Robert Stevens) obnoxious. Also, I felt that some scenes were rushed a little too much. Watch it if you must, but bring ear plugs for scenes involving Juliet or the Nurse.4/10.",Romeo and Juliet
122,tartysheep,No romantic tale will ever beat this one.,9,13 January 2005,Whilst in school we studied Romeo and Juliet and i really enjoyed it. We watched both versions of the film and i thought this one by far the best. This version is more into the actually literature following Romeo and Juliet in their tradition surroundings. The two characters actually look their correct age adding more authenticity. Plus Romeo was hot! The only parts annoying were when Juliet was laughing or crying it was just this weird sound that is not natural. Also the stabbing scene could have been more dramatic with blood and stuff- rather than a hole in Juliet's clothes. But i guess it is a really old movie. This version would be one that literature lovers should watch and if you aren't then watch the modern day version.,Romeo and Juliet
123,ajvenigalla,An authentic adaptation and a masterpiece of film,10,29 April 2014,"I had heard many positive comments about Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet, many of whom hailed it to be the best film of Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare's classic and timeless love/lust tragedy.After finally reading this classic of a story, I finally decided yesterday to embark upon Zeffirelli's classic, and I obviously loved this awesome film. This is my very first film of Zeffirelli's that I have seen (though I had seen some of his acclaimed miniseries Jesus of Nazareth), and it was a rich reward of cinematic excellence, Shakespearian power, authenticity to the environment of the time, sensuality and sexuality, and love.Leonard Whiting is authentically cast as Romeo Montague, the naive and hasty prince who is love-stricken for Juliet, who is perfectly played by Olivia Hussey—a truly beautiful girl that looks sensually exciting both with her clothes on and without (especially in a very controversial sex scene with Romeo and Juliet, which i will get to later). Whiting and Hussey seamlessly blend into the characters of Romeo and Juliet, and one could imagine that this would be similar to how they probably may have looked in Shakespeare's play. They define the characters, and those who play it after will have much to show after Whiting and Hussey infused authenticity and youthful energy into their roles. They elicit authentic emotions and feelings of love, lust, romance, and haste into their roles, making it very Shakespearian and true to the original characters.The rest of the actors also do a great job, including Michael York as the ""Prince of Cats"" named Tybalt, Milo O'Shea as the Friar Lawrence, John McEnery as Mercutio (who kills it in the role, especially in the famous Queen Mab speech and in the mannerisms of Shakespeare's Mercutio). Pat Heywood brings to life brilliantly the Nurse, appropriately infusing in her concern for Juliet's happiness and her comic relief, bringing to life Shakespeare's comic character as well. Now let's get to the sex scene: it's very tasteful in execution and context, especially considering that this is how Romeo and Juliet may have consummated their marriage. Olivia Hussey looks appropriately sexy and Leonard Whiting looks pretty nice (considering we see his rear end for quite a while and Whiting's rack for just a while). It's very controversial and may unsettle a few people, but for the rest of us, it's one of the better sex scenes ever put to film.And finally, what elevates Zeffirelli's adaptation to the heights it has reached is the authenticity that this film has not only to Shakespeare's play but also the historical context; everything feels as if it is real and plausible. The fight scenes are appropriately hectic and chaotic, representing somewhat the theme of haste and foolishness that marked Shakespeare's play. And it sticks very closely to the Shakespeare text in poetry and character without sacrificing cinematic excellence. Franco Bussati, Franco Zeffirelli, and Masolino D'Amico—the scriptwriters—should be congratulated for such a meticulous and excellent job in translating the Shakespeare play onto film. Not only that, Nino Rota's classically enchanting score (especially the famous and iconic ""Love theme"") and Pasqualino De Santis's lush cinematography add further to the beauty of this film. They work with the direction and the scripting and the acting to make this film a masterpiece, and it successfully works.Overall, Romeo and Juliet is one of the greatest Shakespeare films of all time and one of the greatest romantic films of all time—and it is one of the ""great movies"" of all time (rightly honored by iconic film critic Roger Ebert). 5/5Original source - Letterboxd Link: http://alturl.com/bgp5h",Romeo and Juliet

This movie pulls every powerful aspect of Hollywood and leaves out its flaws for this film, masterfully directed by Zefirelli, wonderfully scored by Nino Rota, and beautifully manifested by Leonard Whiting, Olivia Hussey, Michael York, John McEnery and Milo O'Shea for starters. A colorful, lush feast for the eyes, the ears, and the heart...this movie embodies every lovely emotion capable of being produced in the realm of the moving picture.

I actually could not look at the screen while they were on. Their deliverance of Shakespeare was so bad that I (a hopeless romantic, mind you) was happy when they died, just so that they wouldn't talk anymore. And let's not go into the other performances, like the Nurse? All in all I hated it.

126,Figger459,This is a very good version of the best Tragedy in History!,10,1 November 2002,"This version of Romeo & Juliet is definitely at the top of my list! It was good that they Hollywoodified it by cutting a lot of unneeded parts that MIGHT have bored some people that don't want to think too much while watching movies while not cutting many great speeches or changing around Shakespeare's amazing work. The only speech I can see that they cut and shouldn't have was Juliet's speech before drinking the sleeping potion. Also, that Romeo didn't slay County Paris in the end. Otherwise, this is a definitely a very good version that I would rate a 10. There were very talented actors in the movie that made the old English much easier to understand. Almost anybody could see this movie, understand it, and enjoy it!",Romeo and Juliet
127,lucymeyerrisi,Zeffirelli underlines the beauty of the tragedy,9,23 August 2017,"I know that precious images are going to be an essential part of a Franco Zeffirelli film. And Romeo and Juliet is no exception but, there is something else here and I don't mean Shakespeare. There is a real palpitating heart at the center of this perennial romantic tragedy and I believe that the heart belongs to Zeffirelli. Leonard Whiting is breathtakingly beautiful and young, so young as young as the Romeo in Shakespeare's play and Olivia Hussey's Juliet is not only impossibly gorgeous but I could believe that she is prepared to risk it all for the love of her Romeo. Verona with her dusty streets is a character in itself.

I am immediately and eternally in love with it every time I watch. The play is one of my favorite pieces of literature, and I must say that Franco Zefferelli did a beyond magnificent job of realizing Master Shakespeare's vision of young love ultimately ending in tragedy. Brilliant beyond imagination! The 1996 version with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes was okay, but it doesn't hold even ONE candle to this version. And I'm sure many here would agree with me on that statement. One could, or if you haven't seen it yet, you SHOULD, watch this film not only for the wondrously superb performances by all the actors, but for the unforgettable and instantly recognizable score, especially the theme, composed by Nino Rota. All in all, a fantastic film any fan of Shakespeare's works should watch. Sit back, close your eyes, and let this timeless love story take you away and leave you breathless after it ends.

This movie is the sublime orchestration of acting, sets, costumes, cinematography and that exquisitely haunting music. This is the standard; subsequent versions need not be attempted.When I first saw the movie in 1968 I was overwhelmed by it, particularly the guileless acting of the two leads, Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting.

It was a broadcast from Swedish television and it must have been in 1988 or so. I knew the story of Romeo and Juliet off course, but never had I imagined that it would be able to capture me as it did. I was a cynical teenager who suddenly, while watching this film, found myself crying and really feeling the pain and anguish that the two lovers went through...The fact that I didn't know any of the cast(except Michael York-Tybalt) made it so much better! Made it somehow more real. When I saw it again, this time in highschool, senior year,I felt it again...The strong love between Romeo and Juliet. Since then I haven't experienced any film that could do that.I have seen it again a few years ago, and the exact same feeling hit me. Love has never been displayed better on screen than this! But off course, the script was written of one of the greatest writers of all time...But compared to other productions of this play, this one stands out as the very best!

How this movie failed to win Best Picture and Olivia Hussey the best actress is beyond me. The score is outstanding to boot. It still has the power to affect my emotions although I have seen it several times. It is hard to imagine that it was made 45 years ago. If you have not seen the film as of yet, you will not be disappointed. It is a revelation. The director has captured the mood of the time and the intent of the playwright. I highly recommend this version of Romeo and Juliet. I give it my highest rating.",Romeo and Juliet
134,DramaQueenKate,"Before Leo DiCaprio was even in diapers, this much better movie moved audiences everywhere",9,18 December 2005,"This movie is the best filmed of any versions of Romeo and Juliet. I absolutely hate the recent MTV version with Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Daines. Franco Zeffirelli's version of Romeo and Juliet captures the essence of love and tragedy that Shakespeare's play does so well. And because the two leads in this are the closest to the actual age to ever portray the star-crossed lovers, the movie is the most realistic, and therefore the most moving. The acting from the young Leonard Whiting and Olivie Hussey is wonderful, and the direction is superb. Franco Zeffaielli's camera angles (especially in the balcony scene) add to the romantic dialog, as well at the breath-taking fight scenes. The only thing that annoyed me about this movie (and the reason I gave it 9 instead of 10 stars) was that a lot of the text from the play was shortened or completely deleted, including Juliet's monologue before she drinks her potion, as well as Romeo and Benvolio's scene where they talk explain how Romeo loved Rosaline and that she's the reason he goes to the Calpulet ball. As a huge fan of the play, this is frustrating but forgivable since the movie is still breathtaking. The best performance, aside from the leads, is John McEnery as the jokester and Romeo's ill-fated friend, Mercutio. Another great part of the movie is the original score; every time I hear it I think of the movie and almost cry. Yes, I cried at this movie. I cried like a baby. I was completely bawling when Romeo drunk the poison(uh oh, was that i spoiler?) and when Juliet stabs herself(uh oh! another spoiler! well, if you didn't know what happens in the end, you've been living in a hole for the past 500 years, and I'm sorry for that).

I must say this is by far the best movie I have seen. I only regret that I saw the 1996 version of Romeo and Juliet (the one with Leonardo diCaprio) before I saw this one.For anyone who hasn't seen it, I strongly recommend it.  I was never really interested in Shakespeare but we're reading the play in English class right now, and after getting through the first two acts I already wanted to absorb as much about the story as I could.  I rented numerous remakes of the play, but this one is definitely the best out there.There are great costumes, great music, and Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey do a wonderful job of playing the two ""star-crossed lovers"".  (See, I'm working on my Shakespeare...) And never has a movie touched me so much.  I think I cried for the last half hour of the movie...Yes, I know, I'm weak...Anyway, GO SEE IT!

138,kokonsoda,romeo and Juliet.,10,24 May 2007,"romeo and Juliet is a wonderful play. It contains conflicts and issues that teens face today. For example boys and girls today look at appearance rather than whats inside and in this play Juliet did just that. Juliet and knew him for less than 24 hours and already wanted to marry him. In this case it wasn't LOVE at first sight it was INFATUATION at first sight. As for Romeo he was down in the slumps for a while being depressed over Rosoline who he thought he loved. Then he saw Juliet and from then on he realized that he loved her and the she was the prettiest woman and the face of the earth and a couple of hours before that he was saying the same over Rosoline. But anyway some people say that this is such a romantic story when really it's quite devastating and its really more of things happening out of luck and chance. I really love this story because teens can relate to it because now in teens generation once a guy or a girl see one another they instantly ""LOVE"" them... also as i see it the word ""LOVE"" has been thrown around in this story a lot when really Juliet nor romeo knew what it really means.Romeo and Juliet really did like each other but i could tell ass the story went on that it was too good to be true and that if you can fall in love that easily than you can die for love that easily too. so to make a long story short i really love the play and CHOOSE your love wisely! Anyway the other conflicts that happened in this story didn't seem like it was a very nice ending. I think that most of the people that read this play think that the ending is what makes the story romantic because people think that it is sweet for a girl to do die for a mans love and a man to die because his love died for him. but that is what made the play popular and this is what made the play very interesting. I think Shakespeare did a wonderful job of capturing the audiences attention and making that special connection with the different audience type like the servants and the rich i thought that was amazing!",Romeo and Juliet
139,jimmy-stafford00,This was good,7,20 January 2012,"We are studying Romeo and Juliet in English, and we had to watch and compare this version to the 1996 version starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. I own the 1996 version because I am a huge Leo fan, but I must admit this version is much better. The best things about this film are the two outstanding teenage leads, expertly picked by Zeffirelli. 17-year-old Leonard Whiting is convincing and emotional as Romeo, not to mention very good looking, and 15-year old Olivia Hussey positively shines as the vulnerable Juliet. They have amazing chemistry and are really believable as the tragic star-crossed lovers. In the 1996 version, Leo is very very good as Romeo, but Claire Danes is underwhelming and the role is unsuited to her. However in this version the romance truly seems real and not wooden, and their portrayal of the doomed couple is out of this world. The other aspects of the film are excellent as well, such as the scenery, setting and costumes which stay true to Shakespeares original play. The supporting cast are brilliant, with Michael York as a chilling Tybalt, and a comedic turn from Pat Heywood as the nurse. In conclusion, this is a classic, and you must see it.

Also when they showed the dagger it looked like it was rubber and bent into her shirt. it was messed up when the Montague kines men didn't believe Mercutio when he got stabbed and laughed at him when he died. Some parts of the movie where kind of boring like when romeo was spying on Juliet and when Romeo and Juliet get married.

The feud between the Capulet's and Montague's is really strong in the film. This film is different compared to the 1996 version in many ways.Some differences they share is the way they dress, a similarity would be the way they speak but both movies begin grabbing my attention and i believe it'll grab yours too.In this 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet the way the two lovers connect is really mind blowing despite there age. Something i found really interesting in the play is the directors music selections, where as the old version has the classical music and the modern version has the upbeat grooving music.I also thought the character of Mercutio was really funny in this version.So if you want to have a vision of how Shakespeare would've directed the classic I'd recommend taking a look at the 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet where Romeo is played by Leonard Whiting and Juliet by Olivia Hussey.",Romeo and Juliet

149,Juliet-32,A touching portrayal of the greatest love story ever written.,10,9 August 2000,"This is a masterpiece.  I am a great fan of Shakespeare and have not been pleased with most theatrical interpretations.  I find that most movies do not do justice to the great dialogue in Shakespeare's plays.  However, I felt that this movie held true to the way it would have been in Shakespeare's time. Beautiful scenery, superior acting, and genius directing made this film the most amazing and enjoyable film that I have ever seen.  The chemistry between Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey made the film so real that I was often moved to tears while watching it. I can only say that Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet has affected me more than any movie that I have ever seen.  I would recommend it to anyone, young or old, Shakespeare savvy or not. I am certain that this movie will be loved for generations.",Romeo and Juliet
150,jeanie1951,It Hooked Me,8,20 November 2001,"I first saw this ""new theater release"" as a 17-year-old and it remains one of my top ten favorite films after thirty years. No doubt, because Leonard Whiting (Romeo) and Olivia Hussey (Juliet) were teenagers cast in the lead roles, I was interested in the movie ""in spite of"" it being Shakespeare. It hooked me. Were it not for this film, I often wonder, would I have ever been attracted to the collected works of William Shakespeare?
Viewers are exposed to Shakespeare's writing in a period piece (as opposed to a modernized theme) and it appeared to me (then, as now) that no expense was spared on the sets and costumes which were both colorful and exquisite. Leonard Whiting played this young girl's dream of a handsome, intelligent, witty, sensitive boy. Olivia Hussey, beautiful and sweet as the headstrong Juliet, was inspiring and of no threat to teenage girls in the viewing audience. A perfect combination.Laurence Olivier's voice-over narration during the prologue sets both the mood and tone of the film. John McEnery is excellent as the emotional and humorous, yet tragic, Mercutio, while Michael York is memorable as the despicable Tybalt. One movie highlight is the masquerade ball where Romeo and Juliet first meet and a young male soloist performs Eugene Walter III's song ""What Is Youth.""When my daughter came of age, I made sure she saw Franco Zeffirelli's version of ""Romeo and Juliet"" and after that, she was hooked, too.",Romeo and Juliet

It was excellent, better than any other Romeo and Juliet movie ever made!

The aesthetic value of this motion picture is immense. And I believe it does have a special effect on people. It makes them kinder, more considerate and understanding. Exquisitely Italian, brilliantly English, magnificently universal, the film unites cultures and generations. It is unsurpassed in every aspect. The latest production of the same timeless story is probably good as well, but sorry, I fell asleep while watching it. It seems to lack the connection with the spirit of the legend. This is the spirit which makes Romeo & Juliet of 1968 legendary and immortal; the spirit which makes the legend the encyclopedia of life.",Romeo and Juliet

156,bernythehusky,I can't stop watching this movie!,10,14 January 2009,"I recently bought this movie a week ago on DVD and have watched all if not at least a part of it everyday since then! By far the best interpretation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that has ever been made for cinema. The two leading actors, Leonard Whiting (who's charming accent and adorable good looks stole my heart in this movie) and the beautiful Olivia Hussey brought Romeo and Juliet to life with their innocence, passion, and their gushing agony, which at times seemed a bit over-dramatic. But then your remember that they're only teenagers both in the story and in real life, only making their interpretation that much more authentic. I mean, how would you have handled their circumstance when you were 15? :-)The most heartbreaking scene for me wasn't just the death of the star-crossed lovers at the end, but more the death of Mercutio, by the hand of Tybalt. John McEnery's performance was spectacular as Romeo's witty best friend who's unfortunate death starts a chain reaction of events leading to the inevitable end. And then finally the tomb scene when Romeo sees Juliet and murmurs ""Oh my love, my wife..."" have a box of tissues handy cause you will definitely need them!Watching the beginning scenes, the party where Romeo spots Juliet for the first time and the beautiful balcony scene where their love and desire overcome them, the moments before they are to be married, the exciting sword-fight scenes, there are so many parts of this movie that are fantastic, it is one that you will watch over and over again. Franco Zeffirelli's film will forever be a classic that generations will cherish.",Romeo and Juliet
157,chrislyn-1,not so much a review,10,23 August 2010,"Not so much a review more an observation. I teach English at a rural high school in NSW Australia. We have for sometime now been showing both the Luhrmann and Zeffirelli versions as part of a unit of work for Yr9 students.Students are required to write reviews on their preferred versions. Invariably reviews are written on the Zeffirelli version with students in 2010 claiming it to be by far the more engaging movie.They claim to find the setting, the costumes and the colour exciting and the two central characters easy to identify with. Luhrmann's attempt? Loud, too violent and generally too difficult to follow. These are not grammar school kids but ordinary, standard students who find they relate to what is now an over 40yr old movie - praise indeed.",Romeo and Juliet

Juliet looks like she's 11 and needs to learn to cover her boobage properly. I mean really, the story is stupid, the act like they love each other, but if Juliet gained a few pounds, Romeo would be gone, since he obviously thinks through his dick. I'm sorry, but girls now a days really need some self respect. All these kids wanted to do was...each other. So now I have to go on for ten lines about how much this sucked. It's lame. It goes on forever. The scenery is amazingly boring. It's cheesy. I wish they would have just killed each other when they met, so I didn't have to watch a whole movie about it. People are pretty dumb. I find it amazing.",Romeo and Juliet

160,sarahechambers,this is a must see movie. simple as that.,10,30 October 2010,"I'm probably one of the biggest Romeo and Juliet fans, and Shakespeare is one of my favorite play-write of all time. As a young and aspiring actor, I was speechless when I discovered that my high school was doing this is as our fall drama show. So, I spent the summer reading and studying show to prepare myself. I had seen the movie a couple of years ago in school after reading the show for the first time, but was absent for a majority of it. of course, i bought it off of amazon as soon as i could. after watching it again to it's entirety, i was stunned. the setting of the movie was just absolutely gorgeous, the costumes were phenomenal. the acting just blew me away! Micheal York's Tybalt is just dead on, as well as John McEnry's Mercutio; just stunning. And Olivia and Leonard's portrayals of the title characters are perfect and the best I have ever, and will probably ever see. From their looks, to their mannerism and passion, just amazing and incredible. i studied this movie all summer as well, and i believe that it help me tremendously when it came to auditing. Being a 16 year old girl, I can easily say that this is one of my favorite movies. in conclusion, i was cast as Juliet, and hope that i give a performance that is as least as half as amazing as Olivia's Hussey's! (though no one can EVER compare to her Juliet!)",Romeo and Juliet
161,Jamie-MarylandShakespeare,Zeffirelli's give's us the Readers Digest verison of Romeo and Juliet,6,10 February 2010,"Before I go into the review I want to say that a great Shakespeare movie is not required to be word for word perfect. Throne of Blood (Macbeth) by Akira Kurosawa is one of my all time favorite movies and it's not even in English. As far as Romeo and Juliet go, I had just seen the Maryland Shakespeare Festival do a really nice job with this play which I thoroughly enjoyed. So I had fairly high expectations going into Franco Zeffirelli's version, especially after seeing such a high rating on IMDb, and not to mention the fact that it was so popular. First I want to say, the costumes and Italian setting were some of the best I'd ever seen. And the score was stunning. But as far as the movie itself? I hate to say it, but other then Olivia Hussey as Juliet and Pat Heywood the Nurse, (And sometimes the Friar), I thought the acting was stiff and completely unbelievable. Every time Romeo entered the screen I could almost hear Franco Zeffirelli telling him ""Okay' bring your eyebrows together and look pensive. Now do it again. More with the eyebrows' more pensive. Again. Again. CUT!"" And then there's Mercutio, who is suppose to be the dirty joke telling 16(?) year old, slightly older friend that goads Romeo to get in trouble, but will always be there when needed. But no, Zeffirelli's Mercutio was just plain annoying and spastic with no personality. Also they edited out his best (dirty) lines in essence nurturing him. And Romeo with his Waxy pensive looks, you know how they wore those hose stockings in the Middle Ages? Well' Every time the orchestrated musical score would start to soar (Beautifully mind you), and Romeo would give his pensive dreamy look wearing what looked like ballet tights, I swear I thought they were going to break out into a ballet with Romeo pirouetting across the screen. Speaking of Romeo. If you read the play he's a flighty, hormone driven 14 year old boy. How do we know this? Well right from the start of the play we learn that Juliet was NOT the love of his life, it was Rosaline. Yes' Rosaline, who we learn from Romeo's lips is ""The all-seeing sun, ne'er saw her match since first the world begun."" So in reality Romeo is fickle. Romeo has the wandering eye. Romeo is acting like a 14 year old, and looking to fall in love Again. Yet Zeffrelli adds Rosaline to the story with a couple throw away lines pronounced by the Friar in the middle of the movie. Now what about Mercutio's role in Romeos romances in the play as compared to the movie? He's the big brother there to both tease and teach. He's the cool guy with the heart of gold.""I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh And the demesnes (regions) that there adjacent lie"". – MercutioThen there's Olivia Hussy's Juliet. She made the movie, even if there were times she laid it on a bit thick. Still' She came across in every scene as beautiful, innocent, and honest. The first time she sees Romeo at the dance Olivia Hussy's eyes glowed with honest emotion, you could believe she was truly experiencing love at first site. Still, Zeffirelli managed to cut some of Juliet's best lines. When she's about to drink the drought that the Friar has given her to put her into a death like sleep, what does she say in Zeffirelli's version? ""Love give me strengthGulp"". Very short and to the point. Shakespeare gave her some amazing lines here, and instead Zeffirelli give's us the Reader's Digest version (Gulp).Here's what Juliet is really thinking when she sips the potion:What if it be a poison, which the friar Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead, Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored, Because he married me before to Romeo? I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not, For he hath still been tried a holy man. How if, when I am laid into the tomb, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point! Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault, To whose foul mouth no health-some air breathes in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes? Or, if I live, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place,– As in a vault, an ancient receptacle, Where, for these many hundred years, the bones Of all my buried ancestors are packed: Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth, Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say, At some hours in the night spirits resort;– Alack, alack, is it not like that I, So early waking, what with loathsome smells, And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth, That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:– O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Environed with all these hideous fears? And madly play with my forefather's joints? And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud? And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone, As with a club, dash out my desperate brains? O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay! Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.",Romeo and Juliet
162,michelle-bossert15,Far from being a die hard romance,3,11 June 2011,"In a clearly last minute attempt, Franco Zeffirelli scrambled something positively obscured together lowering the quality of the play Romeo and Juliet. If something isn't broken, don't change it. Well Romeo and Juliet was far from being broken and yet it was changed for the worse. In summary this play was supposed to be two star crossed lovers meeting and having a tragic end from a family feud but Franco Zeffirelli turned this die hard romantic tragedy into a sword fighting slightly erotic romance tragedy film.Zeffirelli is the master of using colour, setting and costume to great effect. He was so clever in his casting, not just with the very handsome young Leonard Whiting who I thought was gorgeous but also the innocent Olivia Hussey was perfect. They did a stupendous job on what that were given to work with. Even though they were very young, you could feel the deep connection of them just from looking into their eyes. John McEnery (Mercutio) played his role exact, he spoke of nonsense yet was believable by everyone in the audience.Franco Zeffirelli showed the passion between Romeo and Juliet with countless scenes but not the true connection and love between the two of them. Call me a die hard romantic but I wanted to see a little more dialogue in the balcony scene considering it was the most romantic scene in the book. This relationship in the movie is like Romeo's feelings for Rosaline just passion and not love.Numerous amounts of romantic dialogue from the play is edited out, and many wonderful scenes from the book are cut and has an overall low effect on the film . Truth be told I was utterly confused most of the play, asking myself many questions about what has just happened. If your going to cut out scenes Franco Zeffirelli cut out some of the least important like Mercutio's dream or something, not the most important scenes in the play. Franco Zeffirelli made a very critical mistake of not killing the exact person Juliet didn't want to marry. That's the whole reason everything in the play happened the way it did. This is a fairly decent movie just all the cuts lower the quality of the Shakespeare's writing. So if you ever were going to see this movie, I'd strongly suggest you read the actual play first.",Romeo and Juliet
163,howard_sturgis,the 1968 movie version of the play,8,23 January 2012,"The 1968 version of Romeo and Juliet is a very good and interesting movie that portrays the book very clearly. I suggest that the viewers also look into watching the 1998 version, this version of the movie is very different but does allow viewers to easily comprehend Shakespeare's play. Its also just plain fun to watch.Somethings that were not cool about the movie is the way the show mercutio acting and disrespecting the nurse or how the movie shows Romeo butt naked with his genitals hanging out the window or how they flash Juliet's boobs while turning in bed, the 1996 does not show any nudity but still the movie is good.So i suggest reading the book and then watching the 1968-96 versions afterward to acquire the full understanding and enjoy Shakespeare play thoroughly. So, viewers and readers have fun watching and reading the book and movie of the play.",Romeo and Juliet
164,Dhstolypin,The closest adaptation to the original play,9,29 April 2004,"This classic adaptation bears the closest resemblance to the play, with an authentic setting in Italy and costume from the early Renaissance period. The casting of two teenagers in the roles of Romeo and Juliet is very effective, both in conveying their youthful love and naive romance. The dialogue of the film is delivered in a manner that appears natural, in contrast to the forced efforts of Leonardo DiCaprio in the 1996 version. John McEnery as the troubled Mercutio is excellent, dominating his scenes and stealing the limelight as an incredibly engaging character. Similarly the young Michael York shines as the raging Prince of Cats, Tybalt. The fight between Mercutio and Tybalt is brilliantly staged as a playful contest that ends in tragedy. Perhaps the film is let down by how much it has aged, especially the musical score which despite its initial majesty becomes repetitive and slightly irritating. It is interesting to compare this adaptation with Baz Lurhmann's 'MTV generation' interpretation, but to be honest this is the indispensable film of the two, which I would definitely recommend to anybody studying or interested in the work of Shakespeare. Juliet is pretty fine too!",Romeo and Juliet
165,meagantrack,The Not so Happy Love Story,10,17 October 2012,"Forbidden love is what Romeo (Leonard Whiting) and Juliet (Olivia Hussey) encounter, when both their families hate each other, doing whatever it took to keep the two from being together. Romeo and Juliet tried everything they could to be together even though it led to loved ones being killed. The death of Juliet's cousin Tybalt was the one that led to Romeo having to leave from Verona forever. Romeo tries to marry Juliet, but is told that Juliet died, when really she drunk a poison that made it seem like she died. This led Romeo to go back to Verona and take his own life. When Juliet woke to see Romeo dead she took her own life. In ""Romeo and Juliet"" director Franco Zeffirelli makes this tragic love story come to life, but by using the cast and props he used, he made this film a well-known film of centuries. The movie is an astonishing film that nearly every person knows of; it's the love story that was not able to have a happily ever after ending. Any one who knows the film would say it is a classic that shows not every story can have a happy ending. The movie is a story of two teens who have to take their own lives so they can have some chance of being together which has made this film to be known everywhere. The film consisted of great color; there was always a lot of color while watching the film. The colors were not always bright, but they always went with the setting so if it was bright out the colors would be matching but not super bright. Also the costumes matched the characters and their personalities. One example is the dress Juliet wore in the scene of the ball, the dress is a very bright red that consisted of sequences that matched her personality while seeing her where the dress I got the feeling she was joyful but also a passionate girl. Throughout the film the costumes went along with the character, which gave the film great color and lighting even with some amazing costumes.",Romeo and Juliet
166,hulegu,"An overdone play, but I like the treatment.",10,14 October 2004,"I confess to being a fan of Shakespeare, and of Zeffirelli himself. As such I was undoubtedly predisposed towards a favorable review. While I agree that the play has earned a far greater place in the lexicon of Shakespeare than it deserves, by no means do I think it a bad literary work.The movie itself is no work of genius, rather, I think, a faithful reproduction of the text. Zeffirelli takes no chances, and simply lets the Bard do as he will. As such I think it is well placed as the Shakespeare movie which so many watch in high school. The score, the costumes, the cinematography, all are unexceptional but acceptable. It is also, as is so often noted, nice to see actors who approach the age of the fictional couple. At any rate, I quite enjoy the movie, and would give it three and a half to four stars. Call me old fashioned, but I often enjoy the classic treatment of Shakespeare, especially in an age which seems to favor the more daring and outre aspects of theater. If you enjoy Shakespeare, and, especially if you enjoy this play itself, this is an adaptation well worth seeing.",Romeo and Juliet
167,jaykay9987,"I must admit that I'm not a fan of classic movies and do judge a movie by its release date, but ""Romeo and Juliet"" manages to keep me awake and interested, but just barely.",7,7 April 2013,"Romeo and Juliet (1968) is a ""Killer"" Movie By James Saturday, April 6, 2013I must admit that I'm not a fan of classic movies and do judge a movie by its release date, but ""Romeo and Juliet"" manages to keep me awake and interested, but just barely.In addition to all the drama that William Shakespeare has created within his own play, Franco Zeffirelli's own classic-and-timeless romance movie has its own clever tricks that make viewers notice a few differences between the two. More romantic than ""Gnomeo & Juliet"" and tragic than ""Warm Bodies"" (Both whose movies were based on Shakespeare's play), we can take note that nothing can beat the original.From the beginning of the movie, anybody can tell that the actors are young and inexperienced. This may seem like a bad thing to us ""spoiled movie-addicts"" who have already seen the best actors, but having adolescent actors were a new idea that was introduced during the time that this movie was released. Zeffirelli avoided using the ancient practice of using older actors in the numerous movies that preceded this one. Thank God-! I wouldn't want to watch the concept of Romeo and Juliet revolving around two middle-aged actors.When Romeo (Leonard Whiting), a Montague, falls in love with one of his family's enemies, Juliet (Olivia Hussey), a Capulet, they decide to secretly get married, and so they do. It still boggles my mind why they would want to get married with only a few confrontations between each other. I mean, how far can they get without any problems in their marriage?Not very far. Problems start to arise when Romeo gets banished from Verona because he killed Tybalt (Michael York), a Capulet. As a result Juliet's lover, Paris (Roberto Bisacco), also a Capulet wants to marry her as soon as possible. Juliet doesn't want to marry Paris and only wants Romeo so Friar Laurence (Milo O'Shea), the one who performs the rights of marriage for Romeo and Juliet, makes a plan. The plan is to give Juliet a potion that would make her seem dead, so that she would be buried in the Capulet graveyard. The Friar would send a messenger to Romeo to find her there. Then they would abandon Verona and go live off somewhere else. All this for a person they have barely known.Yes, the movie was set almost word by words by Shakespeare's play, but perhaps that was the thing that restricted this movie from being even better. Some of the things the characters say to each other just sound absurd from time to time. It just felt kind of cheesy. On top of that, there wasn't too much suspense throughout the movie because as a reader of Romeo and Juliet, I already know what's going to happen. Just because it says ""They fight"" at the beginning of a brawl doesn't mean that the play has to be that dull.O Zeffirelli, Zeffirelli, wherefore art thou creativity?Of course this isn't entirely Zeffirelli's fault, as he couldn't add alter the anything from the play, but perhaps something could have been done.Despite that, everything else was how I imagined it go, the crowded streets, soft voice of the narrator, peaceful music to occupy the otherwise empty scenes.This movie reaches my expectations, but doesn't quite reach one of my ""Top 10 Movies"" list.Contains light gore, fighting, and lots of intense teen drama that escalates quickly.

168,connie_champagne,Definitive screen adaptation of R & J,10,22 December 2004,"This is a gorgeous film, and the best adaptation of Shakespeare's famous tear-jerker. All the performances are spot-on. Even though the film was released in 1968, it still rings true. It was filmed on location in Italy, and the sets/costumes really amazing. Zefferelli's (sp?)direction is probably his best. John McHenry, Leonard Whiting as and Olivia Hussey are wonderful. I believe Michael York of Austin Powers' fame made his screen debut in the role of Tybalt. This movie is a must-see for aspiring actors. The cast is more even than the Di Caprio/Luhrman/Danes more recent (and more well-known) histrionic, violent version.

This is without doubt a classic, that everyone should be taught in school in addition to Shakespeare. I'd say this film is a masterpiece which Shakespeare would admire. It is a proof that old films still can compete with the modern films now-a-days. Not only does the actor perform as a modern actors should, but they also manage to capture the sense perpetration of the Shakespearean era.

170,Jaylin,A masterpiece: a very special and emotionally powerful movie,10,7 May 2005,"Words cannot express how much I love ""Romeo and Juliet"". This is my favorite movie, my one and only cult movie, and by far the most beautiful I've ever seen. I wish I had already been born in 1968 to be able to see it in a theater! I happened to watch it on TV for the first time in 1986 as a little girl, and I just thought that Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey were the most gorgeous people and the best-matched couple ever. Then I saw it a second time about ten years later, and was so impressed by it that I found it hard to sleep that night, and quickly became obsessed with it. It overwhelmed me in indescribable ways, and still does so today. In fact, whenever I watch this movie, it haunts me for weeks, and never fails to make me feel like crying in the end. It's a bit weird, really. I can't get enough of it, yet I don't want to watch it too often, because it moves me so deeply... There's definitely something about it that makes it very special. As a matter of fact, it's the only movie that brings me joy and sadness at the same time. Firstly, this is the definitive version of Shakespeare's play. Forget Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard, this is the real stuff, this is how it was meant to be, bursting with life and passion! Everything seems perfect in it: the sets, the colors and the lavish costumes, the music (there's so much to say about Nino Rota's exceptional score alone!), and the cast of course (not only do we have incredibly realistic and top-notch performances by the two lead actors, but the rest of the cast, including Michael York, Milo O'Shea and John McEnery, is also very good). The extraordinary thing about Leonard and Olivia is that they looked just the way one would imagine Romeo and Juliet, pure, sweet and innocent. Whenever I hear talking about Romeo and Juliet, I can't help thinking about them both. Another extraordinary thing is that Zeffirelli had another actress in mind (with blonde hair!) before he finally chose Olivia after a second test. Neither Olivia nor Leonard were experienced actors, yet they delivered stunning performances. They didn't know each other before filming, but it turned out they had wonderful chemistry on-screen, and definitely set the standard as the perfect Romeo and Juliet. I was not surprised to learn that Leonard fell in love with his co-star during the shooting of the movie. I mean, who could blame him? Nino Rota was a very talented film music composer, but he had never written such a beautiful score beforehand. He was extraordinarily inspired when he wrote this one. Considering all these elements, I think this movie is nothing short of a miracle. Granted, it's an old movie. You can see it was shot in 1968. So what? This doesn't prevent it from being very emotionally powerful. I don't think Zeffirelli could have given a more romantic and poignant rendition of this mythical love story. He filmed the two leading actors with grace and sensitivity, and love has never been better indeed. Besides, I think he perfectly captured the quintessence of the play. What else can I say? I love this movie with all my heart. To me it's a jewel, a work of art. And it has its own universe... it's just mesmerizing.",Romeo and Juliet
171,JFClift,The best I have ever seen,10,15 May 2005,"I have seen multiple versions of R&J, from the 30's version, with Leslie Howard (in his 40's I think) & Norma Shearer, to the most recent thing with DeCaprio & Danes. None of them touched me in the way that Zefferelli's did, & continues to do. It was one of the first DVD's I bought, because I can watch it again & again, & still be heartbroken by the ending. The thing that shook me most the first time I saw it was that, in spite of the Shakespearian language, I got the meaning of the characters' statements immediately. The Shakespearian language was not a barrier at all. I had previously had to spend anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes before I could begin to follow the dialogue....there was no lag time with this version. To me, it will always be the definitive film version of this classic.",Romeo and Juliet
172,hwrd_anthony,A realistic movie,10,3 November 2005,"I love this movie so much. It's pretty much the only R&J movie that has real teenagers playing Romeo and Juliet, not people in their late 40's. Franco Zeffirelli did a great job with the set, costumes everything when I watch I start to believe I'm actually in the late 1500's. Spoiler WARNINGLeonard Whiting did a great job playing Romeo a poetic, naive, regular, 16 year old boy, with raging hormones. Olivia Hussey is great at playing Juliet, a dark haired, 13 year old girl going on 14 who has never ventured outside in her walls that are the Capulet Mansion. This movie is by far the greatest most realistic rendition of Romeo and Juliet, well played.",Romeo and Juliet
173,markcavus-08855,The Best Romeo and Juliet,10,24 April 2021,"Everything about this movie is more than fantastic. I do not understand why it is not played on TV or mentioned way more or the stars still interviewed who are still alive. When I looked at the ratings by age groups, The ratings seem to fall with the viewers of the younger crowd. Maybe they just do not have the wisdom or knowledge yet to really rate this movie. It is a shame, as the movie is about youth with youthful, talented, gorgeous actors.",Romeo and Juliet
174,ten-aleven,An excellent adaptation of Romeo and Juliet,10,13 August 2005,"When I come to think of this movie, a thrill comes down my spine. I instantly remember the climax of the movie which is the last scenes in the crypt, where in verse Juliet declares what she feels for Romeo. The plot's turning point is the effort of the monk to save the two and bring the message that would bring the happy end but he fails but by an instant. It makes you want to jump from your seat and try to do something physically yourself. Otherwise, the movie bears all the marks of an old movie... a solid, slow-paced intro, where you adapt yourself to the fact it's in verse. This captures you and makes you want to see the rest. What is particularly catching is the cast: love of the eponymous duo is the first love that catches you like fever at a young age. I think this was very odd, if not revolutionary, at the time, as the main protagonists were youngsters. The more the story gets by its fidelity, and you realise how close it is to real life, even if you clearly see it is set in medieval Italy and in verse. It makes you want to feel something similar... and yet not, because you know the end, the inevitable end, which is a classic. That's why, IMHO, it deserves a 10.",Romeo and Juliet
175,irelynjadeosborne,"1 out of ten, only because 0 out of ten wasn't an option.",1,8 January 2017,"""Romeo and Juliet: Dear Lord have they killed themselves yet?"" ☼☼☼☼☼ 1 star In ""Romeo and Juliet,"" two very young lovers find each other in the middle of a big mess. Even though they are destined for doom, they decide to take their chances with fate. You should probably just watch the last ten minutes; it explains that whole point of the story. To start, you don't even see Juliet for the first half hour of the movie... isn't this called Romeo AND Juliet? They finally introduce Juliet to Romeo at a party one night. Okay, it's going good so far. Immediately after the party, Romeo is already sneaking onto Juliet's property and spying on her. He decides to call her name even though it was dark outside and it probably made her scared for her life. They start talking, and five minutes later... BAM... they're in love. On the plus side of this story, they meet two whole times before getting engaged, not to mention the fact that he proposed to her through her nurse. Not even a phone call? Ouch! At least he didn't drag the engagement out for a whole 24 hours. Meet one day, and married three days later is totally normal. Weird? Only a little. Hold up, now Juliet's engaged again? Wait, but I thought... never mind. So wait her parents don't know that she's married? I mean the least she could've done is let them know, maybe invited them to her wedding? What's next? She's dead. There's a plot twist. SIKE, she's only pretending to be dead to get out of her new engagement. To be honest, it makes sense. Someone should tell Romeo that plan. Too late, He's already killed himself. Seriously, did nobody see that coming? Hey look, Juliet's awake! That's coincidentally timed. Oops, I blinked and now she's dead too. Funny how that stuff happens. Wait that was the whole movie? It took you two-and-a-half hours just to tell me that? Overall, this movie is not worth your time or money to see, as I just explained the whole movie. (Sorry if there are spoilers, but let's be real, you already knew they died.) I didn't like this movie because on top of the fact that it made no sense at all, it wasn't even in English. Wait that was English? Please excuse my mistake. However, you may need a 16th century translator in order to understand it, if those are even around anymore. Although I'm pretty sure they went out of business in 1601. Anyways, overall, it is not worth the effort to go and see ""Romeo and Juliet.""",Romeo and Juliet
176,margaretrosario-44247,Accurately Shown,8,6 March 2017,"An accurate depiction of how Shakespearean literature was brought into a live dramatic tragedy film. Even though they skipped through the text numerous times in the film, they still stayed true to the whole story. The film was able to bring these characters to life and presents how forbidden love Shakespeare intended to be. The visual appearance brings out the tone in the play and actually expresses the emotions of each character more expressively which can be appealing to the audience. Also, the setting gives out a stunning impact that also gives out the mood of every scene that is shown. Even being such an old film it still watchable and entertaining. I highly recommend this movie.",Romeo and Juliet
177,gordonchi,Actually the Best Version of Romeo and Juliet,9,3 May 2017,"This version of Romeo and Juliet is actually more realistic and has a better impression of how the events would have played out if it was actually in the 17th century. The 1996 movie was utter crap, it was cringy, and it leaves you with that feeling of ""Wth did I just watch"" This movie is GREATT",Romeo and Juliet
178,debussy-95270,Lovely film that makes lasting impression of how Shakespeare should be portrayed to teens,9,13 May 2017,"I saw this film a few months after its release... I was 12... the scene where Juliet rises from their mutual bed in the morning and her breast was exposed was considered ""tres risqué"" (and embarrassing to me!) at the time for a near-teen. I LOVED this film and still remember it as setting a very high bar for those of us who were studying Shakespeare. The costuming was inspirational as well. This film brought Shakespeare home -- something we could understand. And the music? The theme song still haunts and makes me weep...",Romeo and Juliet

180,sweethart591,Music is Phenomenal,10,2 March 2006,"This version of Romeo and Juliet is the greatest I have ever seen! Every character fits his or her role perfectly. The Shakespearean language used was NOT hard to understand because of the superb acting. I was pleased with the aspects of both comedy, seriousness, and lust which were evident. However, my favorite part of this movie is the MUSIC/SCORE. Nino Roto, the composer, does an excellent job of combining the lightheartedness of Romeo in the beginning with the tragic feel of the Love Theme. Most importantly, this movie does NOT get boring to watch. The film is great for any student who is reading the book and finding difficulty in understanding what's going on. Believe me, you WILL enjoy it!",Romeo and Juliet
181,srwillia3,Age appropriate characters,10,19 March 2006,"One of my favorite movies.Using the actor and actress of an appropriate age made the movie so much more believable. It never seemed that way when older people starred. I wish everyone with preconceived ideas about classics and the wording would view this movie to get a new look. They spoke clearly and I feel anyone could understand them even with the original story lines. A truly beautiful and moving film that I watch at least once every year even after seeing it over 40 times.Even though there was a very brief scene with nudity (very brief)it did not take anything away from the film. I personally wish they would have refrained from showing them nude because I feel we can all figure out they have no clothes on in bed if they just show the head and shoulders without throwing back the covers and jumping out of bed.Even though it did not distract, it did not add anything necessary.Children of younger ages could have watched it without parents distress over that scene. I am very conservative when it comes to nudity/foul language in films.I do not see a reason for it.Long ago imagination was sufficient when needed.",Romeo and Juliet
