0,SnoopyStyle,cute,6,16 December 2020,Grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro) has some run-ins with the modern world and is bitter with the lost of his beloved wife. He is forced to move in with his daughter Sally (Uma Thurman). He takes over grandson Peter's room. Peter is not happy and he declares war to take his room back.This is silly but it's kind of cute and mostly harmless fun. It's perfectly fine entertainment for the whole family. It is very odd to see some of these adult actors doing this stuff. Sometimes the silly antics elicits a few chuckles. Dodgeball has to be a highlight of crotch shots. That's not bad for a simple family flick.,The War with Grandpa
1,Prismark10,The War with Grandpa,4,13 September 2020,"When newly widowed Grandpa Jack (Robert De Niro) moves in with his daughter's family. His grandson Peter (Oakes Fegley) is forced to give up his bedroom and move into the attic.Peter schemes to get his room back and declares war on his grandpa. However Jack is a war veteran and has a few tricks up his sleeve.I first thought this was a sequel to Dirty Grandpa. In fact this is a family friendly movie based on the book by children's author Robert Kimmel Smith.The pranks between Grandpa Jack and Peter are very much in the style of the Home Alone films.Kids would find this movie amusing. I thought it was uninspired, not very funny, ripping off too many other movies such as Dodgeball. It wastes actors such as Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken.",The War with Grandpa
2,nogodnomasters,You miss 100% of the shots you don't take,4,15 September 2020,"Robert De Niro is too old to take care of himself. He moves in with his daughter Uma Thurman and takes over his grandson's room who now moves to the attic. He objects to the move and starts a ""war"" with Grandpa.This is a family comedy which lacks a good scene or belly laugh. Not very memorable. Should be okay as the second feature for family night.",The War with Grandpa
3,kosmasp,War? What is it good for?,6,8 January 2021,"Apparently a room is worth fighting for. Now the premise itself is quite weak to say the least. Still the movie is decent enough if you don't have too high expectations of it. It is what it is one might say. For what it's worth and all its predictability, there are some funny scenes in this. Also it did something right when it came to casting! And I don't particularly mean Robert De Niro, but all the other players involved.De Niro deliver in one way or another, in this case he sort of gives into his age and what that means. But the comedy genre seems to be the one he feels most comfortable with for a long time now. This is another example of that sort of comedy and you either accept and enjoy it or you don't",The War with Grandpa
4,paul_haakonsen,Good movie with funny moments...,6,25 September 2020,"Well, I have to say that the 2020 movie ""The War with Grandpa"" from director Tim Hill delivers everything you'd expect from a movie such as this. And I must admit that I think that the movie was actually a wholesome entertaining movie for the entire family.Writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember managed to put together a storyline based on Robert Kimmel Smith's book that proved to be enjoyable, fun and entertaining in more than just one way. And ""The War with Grandpa"" is a movie that has some appeal with audiences of all ages.Aside from having a good storyline, then the movie was also packed with pretty nicely cast acting talents, with the likes of Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Jane Seymour, Cheech Marin and Christopher Walken. And I will say that Oakes Fegley definitely managed to hold his ground opposite of a mastodon actor such as Robert De Niro.The movie had lots of funny moments, and I was laughing loudly a good amount of times throughout the course of the story. Sure, it was predictable, but it was goodhearted fun and laughs from start of the movie to the end of the movie.My rating of ""The War with Grandpa"" is a solid six out of ten stars. The movie is well worth sitting down to watch, especially if you have a varied aged audience sitting down watching it together. I can warmly recommend this movie, as it was a wholehearted good movie.",The War with Grandpa
5,michaelRokeefe,Side-splitting consequences,8,29 August 2021,"Sixth-grader Peter (Oakes Fegley), is your typical kid, but loses his bedroom, when his Grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro) is forced to move in. Peter feels it is an injustice to be moved to the attic and declares war. Grandpa Ed won't go down without a fight. The combatants are engaged in an all-out war of funny pranks.Filling out the cast: Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman, Cheech Marin, Laura Marano and Jane Seymour.",The War with Grandpa
6,CinemaSerf,"""Filthy Grandpa"" meets ""Home Alone""....",6,20 March 2021,"Robert De Niro reimagines his now pretty established role as a grandpa. This time a rather independently minded old codger who, after an altercation in a supermarket, ends up having to move into the home of his daughter ""Sally"" (Uma Thurman) and her husband ""Arthur"" (Rob Riggle) - much to the chagrin of their domestically displaced son ""Peter"" (Oakes Fegley). What ensues is a pretty typical sort of prank-driven comedy as the old and young spar over the room. Some of the antics are quite amusing, but the overall theme is just too well trodden and the guest-star cameos - Jane Seymour and Christopher Walken - don't really add very much to it, either. It isn't a bad film, the production is well stitched together, but the plot is unoriginal and to be honest, I'm a little bored with the star playing the same old character, just with different co-stars., before an ending we could spot from space.",The War with Grandpa
7,FeastMode,"fun for a while, but not all the way thru",5,9 June 2021,"I really enjoyed the first half of this movie. I laughed a lot and the premise was enjoyable. De Niro is his usual awesome self and the kid was really good too.But the second half becomes super sappy and family-y with almost no laughs. And on top of that, it becomes so over the top and unrealistic. Only excuse you can make is ""it's just a kids movie."" still made the movie worse.I want to give it a positive 6-star rating, but man that second half was a turnoff (1 viewing, 6/8/2021)",The War with Grandpa

10,cruise01,Forgettable.,4,30 December 2020,2 out of 5 stars.The humor is forgettable and boring. Has that similar jokes like Diary of a Wimpy Kid which is aiming for the younger audiences. The cast ensemble is tedious.,The War with Grandpa
11,marmar-69780,The War with Grandpa,5,11 October 2020,"The War with Grandpa was a somewhat enjoyable family film that will satisfay some younger kids and they could actually watch something that will entertein them but it lacks supstance to please older demographic,it was cool to see De Niro, Walken and Uma together but they were just generic characters that we already seen in this kind of movies and they dont distant itselfs from them in any case.Humor was also plain simple,we got some balls and poop jokes and they werent funny to me at all,there is only one scene in a film were i laughed and that is all, The War with Grandpa was somewhat fine time that could work for young kids",The War with Grandpa
12,DarkVulcan29,Second film with Robert De Niro with Grandpa in it's tittle.,7,13 October 2020,"I walked into this film expecting it to be bad, but surprisingly didn't hate this has much, still not saying it's a great movie. Was very amusing, but there are movies I could watch again and again, but The War with Grandpa is not one of them. Don't get me wrong there where some moments I laughed, The prank war between the grandpa and the kid was okay. The chemistry between Robert De Niro and Oakes Fegley is fun to watch. Christopher Walken, Cheech Marin and Jane Seymour are also good in there supporting roles, you can see that there having a blast making this.The weak spots are Uma Thurman and Rob Riggle has the parents, just did not convince me that they are couple, and Riggle looks bored here and rather be doing something else. Uma Thurman looks incredibly miserable, kind of seems like she doesn't want to be in this, even moments where she acts happy, but I
just didn't see it. Now Uma Thurman and Rob Riggle are talented actors, but this was not a good showcase of there talent. There was a subplot with one of the kids, but with no real payoff. I admire Robert De Niro he is such committed actor, even if he knows the film is gonna be bad, he's committed.
The War with Grandpa was amusing, but nothing more, one time was enough for me.",The War with Grandpa
13,stevendbeard,Average Comedy/Telegraphed Situations,6,11 October 2020,"I saw ""The War With Grandpa"", starring Robert De Niro-Joker, Dirty Grandpa; Uma Thurman-My Super Ex_Girlfriend, the Kill Bill movies; Rob Riggle-Modern Family_tv, Let's Be Cops and Oakes Fegley-The Goldfinch, Pete's Dragon_2016.
This is a family film that is based on a children's book-by the same name-written by Robert Kimmel Smith. It's an average comedy with lots of telegraphed jokes and situations-you know what is going to happen before it happens. Robert plays the grandpa that-after the death of his wife-has to move in with his adult daughter Uma and her husband Rob and their 3 children. Oakes plays the 12 year old grandson that has to give up his room to Robert and he is not happy about it. Oakes has to move up to the attic so he declares war on grandpa Robert to get his room back. Each of them pull pranks on each other, hoping the other person will give in, but you know that that is not going to happen-at least not until the last 15 minutes of the movie, maybe. There are a few cameos of older actors, as friends of Robert; Christopher Walken, Jane Seymour & Cheech Marin pop up.
It's rated ""PG"" for rude humor and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 34 minutes.
It's not one that I would buy on DVD-my wife and others in the theater liked it more than I did-but it would be alright as a rental.",The War with Grandpa
14,dar0417,Really?,5,24 September 2020,This film is watchable with the family but by all means not a great film. It has some laughs and the idea they got all these actors to do this film is mind blowing.,The War with Grandpa
15,r96sk,Just feels off,4,21 March 2021,"Rubbish.Everything about 'The War with Grandpa' just feels off, nothing feels right to me. What doesn't help is that the first 25-30 minutes are extremely dull, like utterly and truly boring. Once the premise gets underway it slightly improves, yet still produces nothing to remember. Even the 'war moves' that feature fairly cool scenarios just come across as very underwhelming.The acting across the board is subpar, at best. That's a major disappointment, given Robert De Niro (Ed), Uma Thurman (Sally) and Christopher Walken (Jerry) are involved. I don't necessarily feel like they weren't trying or anything, but I just didn't sense any spark from them. The kid actors, meanwhile, are average.Despite a relatively short run time of 94 minutes, I was gagging for the end credits for a rather long while. With that said, knowing me I'll still probably check out the apparently upcoming 'The World War with Grandpa' sequel in a few years...",The War with Grandpa
16,cekadah,Depressing,1,30 August 2020,"Honestly, this movie must be a tax write-off for somebody.There is only one person in this piece of crap movie that is funny and entertaining, and that is Cheech Marin. His scenes are few but his talent still shines.Everything else about this movie is about as stupid & unfunny as stupid & unfunny can be. You can use this one hour and thirty minutes to do something productive - like clean your automobile or sweep the gutters in your neighborhood. I think you will feel much better mentally and emotionally.Ugh!",The War with Grandpa
17,jewelch,love it,9,16 March 2021,"Another pleasing, undemanding feather-light Robert De Niro comedy and yet another example where you survey the reviews after seeing the film and wonder if everybody else saw a different version. It's an unassuming, straight up-and-down family comedy. Loved it. James Welch Henderson, Arkansas 3/16/2021",The War with Grandpa
18,kluseba,Entertaining comedy movie for the whole family with a positive message,7,25 November 2020,"The War with Grandpa is an entertaining comedy movie with world class actors such as Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman and Christopher Walken. The story revolves around a forgetful grandfather who is living alone since his wife passed away. His daughter insists that he comes living with her family. He is assigned to live in his grandson's room who himself has to live in the attic. The child isn't very happy about the situation and declares a war on his grandfather who gladly accepts. As the two family members secretely fight each other, they also start appreciating each other more.This movie for the whole family convinces on many levels. The actresses and actors are becoming one with their roles and are doing an excellent job. The characters are quite quirky, diversified and amusing. The movie has many funny side stories such as the grandfather's daredevil friends and the oldest daughter's boyfriend who doesn't get accepted by her mother. The movie has a strong message that family should always stick together in difficult situations.On the other side, the movie also has a few flaws. The story is very predictable. The ending is overloaded with happy stereotypes. The characters are often behaving extremely exaggeratedly which leaves an at times bitter aftertaste such as when the family offers the youngest daughter an over-the-top Christmas party in the middle of the summer.Despite some minor flaws, The War with Grandpa is a highly entertaining comedy movie for the whole family with a positive message that is best enjoyed at a birthday party or around Christmas.",The War with Grandpa
19,aidanratesmovies,That movie where a bratty 12 year old psychologically and physically abuses his grandfather for selfish reasons...now laugh,5,1 February 2021,"Granted, this seemingly forced children's comedy was a lot better than I expected it to be, however- it isn't worthwhile- nor is it fun enough to truly enjoy yourself- and more often than not, only in a ironic manor. The film is directed by legendary children's director Tim Hill who also directed one of my favorite animated films, The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie. The film also stars obviously Robert De Niro in the leading role as well as Uma Thurman, both actors who never more than now show how far their careers have gone down the toilet. The film can be cheeky fun at times, but its writing is often flawed, predictable, and very very cheesy. A fourth grader could have written a more coherent scrip, and there truly is hardly a plot in sight, unless you count callbacks to previous things happening of course. We have a few funny moments throughout, but all the jokes seem rather lazy, if obvious and predictable at times. The cinematography is bland and generic, as well as many of the plots tropes. As I said before too, the story is almost non existent, and there could seriously be about 45 minutes of this film taken out if they really wanted to. All the kid performers are also incredibly horrible, overacting to the best of their ability, and none proving to have really any fun with their roles as does Walken and Chong- the other older relatives of this family comedy. Many of the pranks also seem kinda cruel, which I know wasn't their intention, but you can't help but feel something is off while watching them. In the end, The War With Grandpa isn't a total disaster, but it is honestly a waste of time, and certainly there are better choices out their for kids of all ages to enjoy.
My Rating: 5/10",The War with Grandpa
20,peterp-450-298716,"Please, Robert. Stay away from comedies.",4,8 October 2020,"Sometimes you have to make
sacrifices in a family.What a top actor, Robert De Niro. Most of the films in which he played the lead, became film classics. Memorable roles that will still impress in decades to come. From ""Taxi Driver"" to ""Goodfellas"". From ""The Deer Hunter"" to ""Casino"". Unforgettable masterpieces. The only thing De Niro should have avoided in all these years is comedies. Besides ""Last Vegas"" there isn't a single comedy (at least of those I've seen) with De Niro that I thought was worth watching. Lame humor and an irritating storyline are usually the biggest annoyances about such films. ""Meet the Fockers"", ""Analyze That"", ""The Big Wedding"", ""The Family"" and ""The Intern"", just to name a few. Every time I felt vicariously ashamed. This is also the case with ""The war with GrandPa"".Let's introduce grandfather Ed (Robert De Niro), who's hopelessly left behind after the death of his beloved wife. Next, there's the concerned daughter Sally (Uma Thurman) who wants her father to move in with her family, regardless of what the family members have to say about that. Husband Arthur (Rob Riggle) is again such a good-natured guy (and obviously Ed has nothing good to say about him) who looks at the whole thing with resignation and grudgingly agrees with the whole situation. Then there's son Peter (Oakes Fegley) who's screwed and reluctantly has to give up his beloved room. And this because grandfather's legs refuse to work properly and so grandpa takes up residence there. Peter has to move to the dusty attic with a roof that's not watertight and where unwanted pets run across the wooden truss. The eldest daughter Mia (Laura Marano) has the least problems since she's living in her own teenage world. And finally, there's the adorable daughter Jennifer (Poppy Gagnon). The only one who's extremely enthusiastic about the new housemate.You can already guess what's going to happen after reading the title of the film. Yes, grandson Peter declares war on Grandpa Ed. The stake is the bedroom he had to hand over. At first, Ed finds it all highly amusing. The written declaration of war slipped under his door is treated with derision. And Grandpa Ed is willfully playing the game. It seems so innocent to him. I don't think it's going to be a surprise when it turns out that things start to get out of hand.I thought it was quite astonishing that famous actors cooperated in this average family film. Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken, and Jane Seymour. Admit it, they are not the least. I suppose these actors would also like to experience a pleasant film set with a less demanding, relaxing role instead of a physically hard, intense one. Just like me wanting to have a peaceful moment in the midst of all the horror violence stuff I watch most of the time. The main subject being the clash between youth and the elderly in this movie seemed rather obvious. Unfortunately, there are other storylines that were added and not further explored. Like the love-hate relationship between the mother and her future son-in-law. Or the work situation of father Arthur. The only sidetrack that is gratefully used is the bullying of Peter at school. That was rather funny.The rest of the film is a series of silly jokes those two arch-rivals are playing on each other. The pace at which these pranks follow each other is blisteringly fast. And they are of the level as the April Fools' Day jokes. Replacing shaving cream with quick-drying foam or replacing cookie filling with toothpaste. Well, the movie has its charms. It's a slightly corny comedy. A kind of mixture of ""Home Alone"" and ""Dennis the Menace"". Obviously the film aims at a younger audience because my 8-year-old son next to me laughed a lot while watching. I'm afraid I'm not part of the target audience. I guess I belong to De Niro's age-group. But nobody will ever ask me to play such a part.More reviews here: movie-freak.be",The War with Grandpa
21,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The War with Grandpa,4,2 January 2021,"The War with Grandpa is my latest review. It features movie icons Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken. Now is it a pseudo sequel to The Deer Hunter? Uh no. Is it stupid funny? Nope. Is it just stupid? Totally.Starring a cast of Oscar winners, Oscar nominees, and Emmy winners (De Niro, Walken, Uma Thurman, and Jane Seymour), ""Grandpa"" is a blind miscalculation as a comedy. It's obvious that everyone had fun making it whereas we the audience didn't have a lot of fun watching it. Yup, De Niro's stirring turn in 2019's The Irishman seems like a lifetime away from this monstrosity.The War with Grandpa is directed by SpongeBob monger and Minnesota native Tim Hill. Feeling the need to create slapstick gags out of nowhere and just for the heck of it, Hill molds a puerile film that probably should've never been made (""Grandpa"" was released three years after it was shot).Questions regarding certain scenes in ""Grandpa"": Why can't De Niro's character keep his pants on (he flashes his son-in-law twice)? Why can't De Niro's character just stay in the attic and fix it up (is it that hard to go downstairs and use the bathroom?)? Finally, why is De Niro's character's snotty grandson such a little punk? I mean if it wasn't for your granddaddy you wouldn't exist dude.The War with Grandpa has zero buildup and the barest bones of a plot (De Niro's character probably didn't need to move into his daughter's house in the first place). It's about an a 77-year-old man who inhabits his grandson's room with said grandson wanting it back because he thinks it's rightfully his. Chaos and pranks ensue with everyone involved acting mean-spirited, dumbfounded, aloof, and superficial. ""Grandpa"" is a ""war"" that's only won if people avoid viewing it.",The War with Grandpa
22,rannynm,Perfect family-friendly film starring Robert di Niro as the curmudgeonly old grandpa,8,18 September 2020,"The War with Grandpa is the perfect film for the whole family! It is funny, has great actors and delivers a feel-good message to all of us.This movie is about a boy named Peter (Oakes Fegley) who is your average sixth grader. But, that all changes when his Grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro) moves in with his family. Neither Grandpa Ed nor Peter like the new living arrangement, because grandpa loses some of his independence and Peter loses his bedroom. A secret ""prank war"" ensues as Grandpa Ed and Peter try to outdo each other until someone gives up.This film is based on the best-selling book, The War with Grandpa, by Robert Kimmel Smith. Thanks to Tre Peart, the executive producer, this movie was made. When Tre was in the third grade, he came across the book and suggested to his parents that they should make a movie about it. And here it is! The script is hysterical and takes many lines directly from the book. Also, the amazing cast includes Robert De Niro (Grandpa Ed), who plays a terrific, immature, but loving father and grandfather. Uma Thurman plays a stern, but wonderfully caring mother (Sally), and Oakes Fegley plays Peter, an excellent prankster protagonist. The supporting cast consists of terrific A-list talent including Rob Riggle, playing a ""cool dad."" Christopher Walken and Cheech Marin team up with Grandpa Ed to make him even more immature. My favorite part of the movie is all the creative ways Peter and Grandpa Ed find to prank each other, and sometimes other members of the family (sorry Sally).The messages of the movie are about the importance of communication within a family and respecting your elders. Also - trampoline dodgeball solves everything.I give The War with Grandpa 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 13. Adults will also enjoy this movie.Reviewed by Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!",The War with Grandpa
23,arungeorge13,Hollywood just keeps making movies like this every year! [+40%],4,28 August 2020,"Not a lot to recommend here; it's your standard, predictable comedy with a dash of feel-good family vibes. A grandfather and his grandson (seen in the poster) indulge in a turf war for the possession of the latter's room in the house. The storyline itself is an excuse for an occasionally funny, mostly drab comedy aimed at family-friendly audiences. A few scenes did crack me up; that dodgeball sequence being one of them. Walken is a wise addition to have in films like these, while Thurman and Riggle turn out far less amusing than expected.

Giving his grandfather his room, irks Peter to no end. So, he declares a war to get his room back from Ed, his grandfather.The War with Grandpa is a hilarious movie. Director Tim Hill has given us a family-friendly slapstick comedy, during these dark times that we live in. The comedic set pieces always make you guffaw but, they lose their novelty after a while. There are a couple of moments here & there, that will tug at your heartstrings. Robert De Niro is outstanding as Ed. Uma Thurman is superb as Sally. Rob Riggle is hysterical as Arthur. Oakes Fegley is spectacular as Peter. The effortless camaraderie between De Niro and Fegley, is one of the strong points of the film. Laura Marano is amazing as Mia. Poppy Gagnon is adorable as Jennifer. Cheech Marin, Jane Seymour, Christopher Walken, Juliocesar Chavez, Isaac Kragten & T.J.

33,trinaboice,Mixed reviews,5,9 October 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Directed by Tim Hill, THE WAR WITH GRANDPA is finally in theaters, after several failed releases in 2017 and 2018 due to the Harvey Weinstein scandal. The family comedy features flying dentures, trash-talking kids, and is based on the children's book The War with Grandpa by Robert Kimmel Smith. In a time of chaos and uncertainty in the world today, it's nice to have a light-hearted, family-friendly film. Of course, it's predictable, but it's a feel-good fun time and we all need more of that. Some people will think it's hilarious; others will think it's silly nonsense and mean-spirited. The trailer shows exactly what you can expect. If you like what you see, go for it. If it looks dumb, skip it.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some violence
Bullying and name-calling
There are some phrases I never allowed in my house, like ""Shut up"" or ""I hate you!"" They're allowed in this family's house.
Some alcohol
Talk and portrayal of men dressing up as Santa
A teenage girl lies to her parents that she is going to study, but she really goes out with her boyfriend.
You see an old man topless.
There is an extremely extravagant birthday party your kids may want you to duplicate.
Lots and lots of pranks. Some people get hurt.
Some people break the law.
2 not fully enunciated F-bombs
Anatomical terms in Spanish
2 Scatalogical terms
7 religious exclamations
In case your child thinks going to war with a grandparent looks like great fun, talk to him/her about how people got hurt and a lot of things were damaged, requiring expensive repairs. Of course, teach your kids about respect.THEMES:
""Sometimes we have to make sacrifices for family."" - Sally (Uma Thurman)
War hurts.
Lack of respect for people and property
Selfishness
Parenting kids, caring for aging parents
Jealousy
Death of loved ones
FamilyTHINGS I LIKED:
Academy Award winner Robert De Niro is great at both drama and comedy. Despite his controversial political statements in recent years, he's an excellent actor and a fan favorite. This is his second movie starring in a movie with the word ""Grandpa"" in it. Watch for the references to his other movies.
I haven't seen Oscar nominee Uma Thurman in anything for a while. She's obviously had plastic surgery, but she looks great.
The talented cast includes the lovely Jane Seymour, funnyman Cheech Marin, and the quirky, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken.
Young Oakes Fegley does a great job and has a bright future in acting. I thought he was so sweet in Pete's Dragon.
Good for the parents for having no boys in the house when no parents are at home rule. My parents had the same rule.
It's cute how the pranks bring the grandfather and grandson together.
There are some scenes that were pretty entertaining like the dodgeball scene,
Laura Maran will be most familiar to young audiences from the Disney Channel show Austin & Ally: Chasing The Beat, where she plays Ally Dawson. She sings one of the songs in the movie called ""Point of War"".
Keep watching after the first song during the closing credits for some outtakes.
There are quite a few running gags throughout the movie. Some work. Others not so much.
There are some sweet family moments and lessons learned.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
What a bratty attitude Peter has toward his grandfather. When his friend tells him to start a war and fight for what is rightfully his, Peter says, ""You're a bad friend"". He's right. It's terrible advice, yet he decides to go to war, telling his grandfather, ""You took something of mine and I want it back!""
The movie trailer did a much better job showcasing the snake scene than the actual movie did.
There's some real infantile humor that features Robert De Niro with his pants down twice.
The moment when Uma Thurman goes nuclear fell flat for me. There was no epiphany in her eyes, only an instant change of attitude.
One of the kids always says crude things.
Not all of the humor lands.
Some scenes last way too long like the ""Shhhh"" scene.
I really like Rob Riggle and he does a good job with the material he is given. Unfortunately, as a father, he is emasculated and 100% useless in this movie.
The ending was dumb.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",The War with Grandpa

39,SnobReviews,Almost unwatchable.,1,3 September 2020,"Ridiculous, cringe-worthy and almost unwatchable; ""The War With Grandpa"" makes it hard to believe Robert De Niro would ever take part in a film like this.In this family comedy, upset that he has to share the room he loves with his grandfather, a young boy decides to declare war in an attempt to get it back.If you've ever hated your grandpa as much as the kid in this film, you should get help. You know that ""The War With Grandpa"" was clearly a filler film for both De Niro and co-star Chris Walken. How did these leading men ever get persuaded into making this film? Walken was the one actor who had one or two funny lines and that's it. A complete waste of talent in a more than basic, wannabe family film.Follow @snobmedia for more reviews!",The War with Grandpa

41,movieman6-413-929510,SpongeBob co-creator directs a family movie with the same kind of humor.,5,17 September 2020,"The War with Grandpa is a new comedy family movie directed by Tim Hill, the director of The SpongeBob movie: Sponge on the Run and Garfield 2.In the film, grandpa Ed (Robert De Niro) has to live with his daughter Sally (Uma Thurman) as a precaution. Here he gets the room from her son Peter (Oakes Fegley) and he has to move to the attic. Despite the fact that Peter loves his grandfather, he wants his own room back. With the help of his friends, Peter devises plans to expel his grandfather from his room. When Ed realizes what Peter is doing, he strikes back in his own irritating way. This creates a battle between grandfather and grandson, about who can irritate the other the first and thus claim the bedroom.Tim Miller is known as one of the creators of the animation series SpongeBob SquarePants and as a director of animation films. He also brings back the childish SpongeBob humor in this film. Many moments seem a bit unbelievable, but these moments still manage to provide entertaining scenes for younger viewers. If you are an older viewer going to this movie, you better not go there with too serious thoughts for a more entertaining time. If you are still a fan of the SpongeBob series or the kind of humor that occurs in the series, you can also laugh at certain comedy moments in this film, or at least appreciate them a little more.The acting is done nicely by the younger cast, but with some you can see that they are still starting actors. Younger audiences can enjoy themselves a bit more and relate to the young cast. From the young cast comes T.J. McGibbon, who plays a girlfriend of Peter's is the best forward. Still, the older cast provides the most comedic work in the film, especially older viewers. Robert De Niro has done better comedy acting in his other comedies, but with the help of actors like Cheech Marin and Christopher Walken, he ensures good comedy moments in the film. Rob Riggle, who is better known as a comedy actor, comes across less in this film together with Uma Thurman.",The War with Grandpa
42,Brooklynsmagicmike,"Funny and emotional, I really enjoyed this movie.",8,24 December 2020,"After finishing this film I was extremely shocked to see how many people panned the film. It had a great cast of actors in it, pacing was good, and the premise was different and entertaining.The movie was also really funny. Sure there were some jokes that fell flat, but overall I had a lot laughs. I was suprised to be honest however that this film was rated PG. Without giving to much away there is lot of crude material in this film. Therefore I would't recommend watching it with any younger members in the family unless they're teenagers.Honestly I would of gave the movie 10 stars if it wasn't for the older daughter character. She was incredibly annoying, added no humor to the movie, her acting was bad, and lastly she really gave no advancement to the movie. Had she been taken out completely the movie would went along just fine and there wouldn't be remote difference. Not sure why she was added or what the direction was suppose to be with that.Either way don't listen to bad reviews and give this movie a try yourself. I would definitely recommend it.",The War with Grandpa

44,zac-04879,Enjoyable But Unsatisfying; Doesn't Live Up to what we were Expecting,6,29 July 2021,"It's difficult to avoid declaring that The War with Grandpa is just an average slapstick prank-wars comedy for families, but the watchable design takes most credit. Despite the fact that parents and adults will feel like they're just witnessing recycled pratfalls and silly jokes, it's definitely enough to entertain kids. Plus there's also some unexpectedly spectacular messages worth including on everyone's notes, mainly recalling well-spoken lines such as ""war hurts"" and ""war isn't meant for fun"". It's definitely worth pointing those words out an extra time to your family.But other than those lines and the satisfactory performances delivered from the cast, this prank-wars-related comedy is exactly what most young kids will appreciate. It's watchable enough, but there are the usual sections that won't engage many adults. That includes the clever but old slapstick humour and average karma.Without the talented Robert De Niro playing the film's Grandpa, it'd probably feel like less to most people. But what will probably disappoint most critics and audiences is just the story itself. You'll watch the trailer and gain high anticipations believing it'll be an exciting, hilarious and entirely entertaining comedy, but we'll all leave feeling like we didn't receive exactly what we had expected. It isn't as fast and fulfilling as most families will expect, but is a popcorn-fun watch.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",The War with Grandpa

Peter wants his room back and goes to war with Grandpa.True Peter has problems with a bully at school, but he finds a way to take care of it. Later Grandpa Ed and his friends also take care of the bully.There are many laugh out loud moments and some good, but not really LOL skits, but you decide.Notables: Uma Thurman as Sally, Peter's mother who needs to watch her daughter Mia (Laura Marano) with her boyfriend Russell (Colin Ford); Rob Riggle as Arthur, Peter's father; Riggle is a comedian, but did nothing funny in here that I saw. Christopher Walken as Jerry a good friend of Ed; Cheech Marin as Danny also a good friend of Ed and both Jerry and Danny participate in a Dodge Ball game against Peter and his friends; Jane Seymour a grocery clerk who helps Ed also in that Dodge Ball game; Joe Gellchion as Chuck and he is Ed's Lyft Driver.The is quite enjoyable. No outrageous practical jokes or pranks, well, there was a little bit of annoying slapstick in the beginning at the supermarket.

47,CabbageCustard,The acting equivalent of slumming,4,30 August 2020,"There is a startling amount of talent involved with this movie - unfortunately, none of it amongst the writing staff. This is predictable, unfunny and features a completely ridiculous premise. Yet, this movie stars Robert de Niro, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken amongst other acting luminaries. What a wealth of talent in such a nothing movie. This is the kind of film I would expect to star someone like Chevy Chase, not real actors like those who are actually involved.The best you can say about this is it's not completely horrible. It passes the time. Less demanding juvenile viewers may get a laugh or two out of it, but there isn't much here for older viewers.",The War with Grandpa

51,MinistryofDoom,Hilarious Slapstick and Family Friendly!,6,4 September 2020,"This movie is hilarious. It's the type of absurd slapstick comedy we don't get enough of in Hollywood anymore. Robert DeNiro as Grandpa is fantastic. He's both funny and heartwarming; the type of grandpa most kids want. Uma Thurman and Rob Riggle as the parents are also very funny and play off of DeNiro's character very well. The story follows a boy named Peter who's excited that his Grandpa is coming to live with his family...until he discovers that Grandpa is going to be staying in his room while he's moved up to the attic. This sets off a war of pranks and hijinks between Gramps and Peter as they try to one up each other. Overall, it's very good and will keep you entertained throughout. DeNiro, in particular, really shines. Gather the kids and give this one a shot, you won't be disappointed.",The War with Grandpa
52,lotekguy-1,Family comedy that's a safe bet for shared enjoyment,6,9 October 2020,"Robert DeNiro's track record in comedies has been more erratic than with his esteemed career of dramatic outings. That differential is evident in the quality gap between his excellent pairing with Billy Crystal for Analyze This, and its unfortunate sequel three years later, Analyze That. The same can be said for the two Fockers comedies as textbook cases of large sequel dropoff. The low point was his role as Fearless Leader in the live-action tarnishing of a beloved cartoon series, The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle. This one splits the difference, leading to a reasonably entertaining mix of schmaltz and laughs.DeNiro is retired from his construction business, recently widowed and truly depressed. His daughter (Uma Thurman) persuades him to move in with her family rather than wallow in his sadness. Unfortunately, that's two parents with a son and two daughters in a three-bedroom house. The tweener son (Oakes Fegley) has to give up his room and move into the ratty unfinished attic. He loves granddad, but not enough to graciously cede his domain. DeNiro isn't happy about upsetting the lad, but sees no option and tries his best to blend in with the others.The plot is driven by the boy formally declaring war on Grandpa, leading to a mostly-funny escalating series of pranks and reprisals within agreed rules of engagement. Both are assisted by their respective trios of friends; DeNiro's surprisingly consists of Cheech Marin, Christopher Walken and Jane Seymour. Given their small amount of screen time, the three were obviously more motivated by the chance to work with a living legend than the juiciness of their roles. The script contains a few complementary subplots involving the rest of the family, as well.Some parents might question the rating, since the pranks raise the ""kids don't try this at home"" flag. If there's a demonic streak in any of your progeny, you might not want them to draw inspiration from these antics. Otherwise, it's fairly standard family fare with relatable conflicts and resolutions, and not a bad way to spend your together time.",The War with Grandpa
53,girvsjoint,De Niro a good vintage,9,5 December 2020,"Robert De Niro is like a fine wine, he gets better with age. To tell you the truth I was never a big fan of his more celebrated dramatic films, but I've become a big fan of his later comedy films, like this one. He handles the genre well, isn't afraid to play his age, and OK, they may not ever garner him another academy award, but they are fun, this movie is a good laugh, nothing tacky in it like most modern day 'comedies', just some good old fashioned slap stick laugh out loud humour, Christopher Walken was terrific, as was the entire cast.

If you watched the trailer and thought to yourself ""That looks good, lets see that!"" You'll probably enjoy it. Because you're sense of humor is dumb. This movie is bad. If you know what a good movie is don't see this, if you know what comedy is don't watch this.
How they got some of these A-list actors to be in this movie is so beyond me. Robert DeNiro are you okay? I will say though- Christopher Walken had no visible shame in this movie.

57,chris_rowe-881-168820,Not good and I'm a fan of this genre,3,29 October 2020,"I love movies of all kinds, for all moods, I think that mostly they all have a place, from parent trap to cheaper by the dozen, pacifier etc even the new movie sleepover had moments, I'm a fan of this genre as daft easy to watch films.This was easy to watch no doubt but it just wasn't enjoyable, I feel that's mainly down to two huge issues, cast and writing.I thought the parents were fine and youngest daughter was great but the kids friend were terrible especially the kid bullied by his sister it was just so forced and unfunny. Then the older sister just stunk, pretty girl but just acting that for me was not movie worthy, she was very poor but the main kid was rubbish, how he spoke, his facials and mannerisms were garbage, the line about curling up and dying... aged 12 was ridiculous, he wasn't likeable and that killed the film. He just seemed a brat who's pranks were just plain nasty rather that cute and funny.Robert deniro is class but just looked like he couldn't be bothered here, didn't seem to have chemistry with anyone except his friends who were all fine I guess, he just felt wrong in the part due to just phoning it in. Didn't feel like a deniro masterclassThe writing was bad, it felt nasty and just not fun, wasn't warm, not funny, nothing very new or clever and a host of bad performances made this one to miss or put on in background, even playing with fire is way better than this. The movie not actual fire.Real shame. Kid actors make or break these movies, Matilda wasn't particularly great but the girl was a star. Obviously didn't pan out growing up but as a kid she was, home alone, parent trap etc. Instant family was an example of good kid actors",The War with Grandpa
58,garethvk,Great Cast And Premise But Strictly For The Kids,5,8 October 2020,"Ed (Robert De Niro); is a man at a turning point in his life. The retired builder and widower is forced to move in with his daughter Sally (Uma Thurman); following an incident at a local store.This new arrangement is accepted by the entire family with one exception; Peter (Oakes Fegley) who despises the idea of giving up his room to his Grandfather and having to take up residence in the attic. The fact that Peter is starting Middle School adds to the tension as he and his friends are now the target of bullies as well as his older sister whose disdain for him is evident.Desperate to get his room back; Peter declares war on his grandfather and enters into a series of events designed to harass him into giving up the room so Peter can reclaim what was his. Ed finds the entire thing amusing and his friends Danny (Cheech Marin), and Jerry (Christopher Walken); help him see the bigger picture and support him as Ed gives back even better than he gets. As the conflict escalates' the stakes become higher and the entire family gets caught up with ""The War With Grandpa"".While it was nice to see such an All-Star cast on the screen they are not given a great deal to do in order to stand out as this is a film that is very much aimed at Middle Schoolers and kids in general. I found the humor more amusing than funny and what really bothered me most was the underlying message of the film. In an era of entitled kids who lack respect; the film basically says it is fine to harass your elders to get what you want and that your needs come before theirs.
This could have been mitigated with some more balanced humor and perhaps a change of heart but as the film unfolds Peter shows just what a self-centered individual he is.While I wished I could have enjoyed this film more as the premise and cast were great, the lack of laughs and overall message of the film did not work for me making this one for the kids.2.5 stars out of 5",The War with Grandpa

In my opinion, he is a living breathing book on how to act. Also, Uma Thurman was good in this movie. Oakes Fegley is very talented. We will hear more from him in the future.

It was the biggest part of the movie. This would have been a great movie if they didn't follow the normal practice that some BAD directors tend to do: Add a scene that is totally BS and unbelievable, simply for shock value and don't care about everybody spending their money at the movies hoping for something great! It was the biggest part of the movie. And it was doing great until the last couple seconds. They simply blew it. That scene lost them 2 stars. I CERTAINLY recommend the movie IF tickets are half off and you're allowed to bring your own food and drinks. Otherwise WAIT for it to show up on streaming media.Scene spoiler: I'm not going to mention everything that happened that led up to the disappointment, just the very last part, because I don't want to spoil it for you. Basically there was total chaos at the little girl's birthday party because of a booby trap the boy set up for his grandpa. I was loving this part of the movie UNTIL: something bumped into a tree and the whole tree was uprooted and fell against the house, tearing a huge hole into the side of the house. Yes a huge evergreen. Some of the action prior to this was already slightly unbelievable and this part 'sealed the deal of disappointment'.",The War with Grandpa
77,AaronRush9,Silly but has hilarious moments,7,28 August 2020,I watch every Robert de Niro movies especially comedy's as he can be really funny in those movies this one is more PG than dirty grandpa but as a 23 year old I laughed at some most of the scenes recommend watching with the family,The War with Grandpa
78,ChrisinDesMoines,Rented it from Redbox on the spur of the moment,9,6 March 2021,"Pretty decent wholesome entertainment for the family, but I suspect that it will have more appeal for boys than for girls.Recently widowed Grandpa is forced against his will to move in with his daughter's family with her son, Peter, forced to give up his bedroom and move into the rat and bat infested attic to accommodate Gramps. Peter, unhappy that he has to give up the room decides to declare war on Grandpa to get his room back.Yes, this movie has your typical family movie slapstick comedy and I would be lying if I said that I don't get some enjoyment from seeing a sixth grader get the best of De Niro, but apart from that, the story is actually enjoyable to watch.De Niro is a good actor and it's rare that I watch a movie he's in that I don't like. The young man playing Peter is actually pretty good in this movie as well and can hold his own on the screen with De Niro. Hardly Uma Thurman's best work on screen, but she does manage to bring forward some genuine laughter from me.The running theme in the movie is that ""war takes a toll on everyone, those who are engaged in it as well as innocent bystanders"" something that Grandpa tries to warn young Peter about and despite the ""rules of engagement"" where it's specified that no one but them gets targeted, innocent (and not so innocent) bystanders get caught in the crossfire.Older viewers will catch several references to movies scenes but altered in a way to be family friendly and De Niro's acting does a good job of having Grandpa walk that fine line between being a frustrated man warring with his grandson while still being loving and trying to teach him.I enjoyed this movie quite a bit and will likely buy it.",The War with Grandpa

82,OneView,Fun with a Touch of Realism,7,2 September 2020,"My expectations were not high for this one - a film shot three years ago that failed to get any kind of release, featuring some high profile names (Robert De Niro, Uma Thurman, Christopher Walken) and based on a huge-selling children's book.I was surprised to find myself smiling throughout, amused both by the pace of the film and its efforts to ensure that every scene had at least one solid laugh. Pitched towards a family audience My War with Grandpa is centred around an average family who invite an older relative to live with them. Due to knee difficulties he cannot easily manage stairs so his grandson is required to give up his bedroom in order for the grandfather to have somewhere to sleep. Banished to an attic bedroom the grandson declares formal war on his senior relative and an amusing battle of wits and practical gags follows.The cast are very game and embrace the silliness of the ever-escalating war and the story has enough of a touch of realism in its family dynamics to make it very relatable. De Niro is clearly willing to try anything despite his advancing years and he is given good support from contemporaries including a frail looking Walken, an enthusiastic Cheech Marin and the forever upbeat Jane Seymour. Uma Thurman has an amusing subplot as the unknowing middle generation between grandfather and grandchild and faces being the victim of circumstance in increasingly amusing encounters with a local police officer.Production values are generally high with some ambitious stuntwork and colourful settings. I was surprised thought that the credits for a simple comedy ran more than ten minutes, even with the inclusion of a few outtakes and behind the scenes footage the slow paced credits seem unnecessary.Overall this was hugely enjoyable and a film I think I will actively revisit until the time when I hopefully become the grumpy grandfather embedded unwanted in his descendant's household.",The War with Grandpa

I avoided the reviews first and went to the box office sales to see if it was good for myself, it's not.

103,isaacglover_05,Absolute trash,1,16 December 2020,"I don't get how mainstream movies in America continue to churn out the exact same movie every year, and people just allow it to happen?
Such awful writing for young teens. It's clear that the writers had no idea what interactions between young kids are actually like. You have the main characters (Oakes Fegley) surrounded by such flat, unfunny, one-dimensional characters that add no value to the story. One owns a snake? Another has a sister that likes to embarrass him for no reason (there's a scene where she meets him at the lunch area and tells his friends about his fungus problem) and there's a girl who seems to be there more so for gender diversity rather than anything else.
Then there's the main character's parents, who are meant to be ""goofy"" and try to portray a more 'realistic' type parents, but try too hard to be as funny as the parents from Easy-A and yet they fail miserably.
And then there's Robert De Niro, who has fallen under the trope of ""Old man played by famous actor from the 70's, now trying to understand how to use technology, because ha-ha, old famous man don't know how to turn on an iPhone"".
The plot revolves around Robert De Niro and Oakes Fegley. Robert De Niro's character, Ed, has supposedly lost the plot? Because he didn't know how to work a self-checkout machine at a Walmart. So he goes to move in with his daughter (played by Uma Thurman). The conflict is that Oakes Fegley's character, Peter, has to move his bedroom to the attic to cater to Ed on account of him being old and can't use stairs I guess? (Ignoring the fact that Ed has no issue playing game of dodgeball with his other 'old' pals at a trampoline park). So Peter decides to wage a war against Ed, for no other reason than to get his old room back. Ed doesn't really want to be involved. He just wants to go about his day in peace and fawn over the loss of his late wife (which I guess is supposed to add depth to his character, but, just like Peter's friends, the dead wife adds no value to the story, but more so a shrug-of-the-shoulder type plot device).
This takes up most of the movie. Just a grandfather and his grandson playing pranks on each other, all over a bedroom. That's about it really. The pranks are supposed to add comedic value to the movie, but they're so predictable that you could smell it from a mile away. Pullings screws out of the furniture, setting alarms off at unexpected times, manipulating one another into doing something that turned out to be a trap. From this you can get a sense of where the story is going to go, and that's exactly where it goes.
Ed and Peter develop a liking towards each other (because, you know, they're related after all) but the pranks become too much and people get hurt, and that's the climax of the story. Apologies are exchanged, feelings spill out. The end.It's a movie that has been done time and time again, and will most likely continue to be made till the end of time. It makes for a quick buck, put together under a huge Hollywood budget, you bring in a couple of famous actors (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, Uma Thurman) and, hey, you have a movie! The humour is predictably slapstick when it comes to the pranks, and the interactions between the teens are too dry and are trying so hard to be relatable to the younger generation, but it fails to do so because the writers do not know how to accurately portray young teens in an authentic yet funny way. Its mindless storytelling is insulting to any viewer of any age, and it should not be viewed by anyone. Let the production companies sweep this under the rug and pretend that it doesn't exist.",The War with Grandpa

A well done scene with the grownups watching TV and talking parenting shows that there is perhaps more heart to the project than other direct to video faire.Although the film will fit in well with families who enjoy the Diary of a wimpy kid series, there is times that it comes off a tad cheap.",The War with Grandpa

Overall the storyline is passable, and there's a good message to it, but some of the acting feels more like script reading.
The side gags are repetitive and don't really add to the plot. Some of the minor characters feel unnecessary and an unjustified add-on to fill out the plot.",The War with Grandpa
148,emmalingster,Really dull,2,27 October 2020,Great cast ! This is as good as it gets unfortunately. Cast are all wasted in this boring drivel. Not one laugh to be had.

With that said, this film is great fun, Deniro is great as is the whole superb cast. Its great to see deniro and walken again in the same film!

154,ericaschwartz-07976,GROUNDBREAKING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,19 August 2021,"THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE IN AMERICA N CINEMA HISTORY!!!!! Everyone should see this movie. It is GROUNDBREAKING with stellar performances. Uma Therman gives an Oscar winning performance in this movie and it is definitely one of the best performances of her Career. Whoever said she needs a new agent is wrong because the fact that she took this role is incredible. Laura Morano gives an outstanding performance as well! She has proven that she has found success and that she can still act and do great performances even after Disney. She is going to have a great career ahead of her and this movie shows it. But the most important part of the movie and the best part is the relationship between the grandpa and his grandson. Their relationship starts out rocky lol but it gets better towards the end as learn a lot which I think is so heartfelt and it really sticks in your head just how important your grandfather is. I never had one of grandpa's because he left so please anyone with a grandpa please be respectful of them. Anyways to wrap of my message, I would love for everyone to please do yourself a favor and watch this with your family then tell your friends to go watch it with their family's. I laughed and cried and showed all the feels during this movie. I am so happy that I watched this and I will never forget the first time I watched this how amazing it is!!!!!!!",The War with Grandpa

It's a cute family movie with just enough adult humor but the storyline had some unbelievable points where from a grown up perspective you think ""that without never happen"".

Otherwise, all the jokes missed the mark. The cinema was dead silent most of the film and it made me cringe.This was about as lazy an attempt at script writing out there, and the acting was poor. The amount of cheesiness was insane, making it hard to watch.My kids both thought it was stupid, too. Best to avoid this one.",The War with Grandpa

159,Delta4220,Christopher Walken was the only good part,4,13 October 2020,"This is a movie specifically made for young teens. It does not in any way entertain older audiences.It should be a Nickelodeon or Disney special as it is also made from Tim Hill who directed Spongebob (which was way better) and Alvin and the Chipmunks which has not aged that well, but it still more entertaining than a home alone wannabe knock off.The punchlines of the jokes are so bland that if you're not under 10 years old I do not see you laughing at it. EXCEPT for the legend Christopher Walken, let's face it, he gave more of a performance for this movie than the whole cast combined, even De Niro's brilliant acting could not match the aura and charisma that this man carries to the screen, any moment with Walken feels like he's giving his all to make people laugh, just listening to the way the guy delivers his lines and talks is entertaining. Sadly the screen time of Walken is very small. It would have been smarter to give the older actors more screen time and make it their movie, that would have definitely been more entertaining. Telling the story from two sides does not always work well. Especially when one side is a 12 year old child going through his Emo phase and on other you have a broken man who is silently asking for help.Sometimes giving one perspective is just more enjoyable.An easy 4/10 for Christopher and De Niro, who literally broke their old backs from carrying this movie.",The War with Grandpa

169,Vancouver77,Super fun & lighthearted movie!,8,2 April 2021,"Listen, I am not a film student or professional critic, just an ordinary person looking for something enjoyable to watch. I don't watch a lot of comedy movies, because generally I don't find them that funny. (I am more into thrillers & mysteries). I must admit though, I really enjoyed ""The War With Grandpa"" - it is fun, light-hearted and has highly relatable & non-offensive humour. It isn't a rowdy, laugh-until-you-cry kind of comedy. However, it is amusing throughout. I spent most of the movie giggling & thinking, ""THAT IS SO TRUE!!!!"". For instance, (without revealing any major plot details) - the shoppers furious with the grocery store self-serve checkouts, the young son being moved to the bat-filled attic to make way for his grandfather moving in (I giggled when I saw the creepy attic which is only outdone by the even nastier basement!!!), the little girl (played by Poppy Gagnon) who is obsessed with Christmas, the older sister embarrassing her younger brother at school (wow, is she effective!), the husband not permitted by his wife to use a chainsaw.... Seriously, even the scenes of the kids in grade school will take you back to your own school days, no matter what age you are! If you told me before today I would watch a movie and laugh aloud at humour about Grade 6 students, (which is FAR too many years ago - I didn't think I even remembered!) - I would NOT have believed you. Although the main character played by Robert De Niro is a rather stereotypical senior citizen (for example - reluctant to embrace technology), the movie also shows that the ""stereotype"" is a broad generalization that is (of course) not universally accurate - because Robert De Niro's senior citizen friends are hip, fresh, active & keep up with the latest trends. And trust me, you don't need to be Robert De Niro's age to be amused at his character - I found his difficulty using a tablet reflected my own, & the staring-at-nothing-while-listening-to-soppy-music is an almost universal cheezy experience. All of the actors are good in their roles (Uma Thurman is a bit wooden IMO but again, what do I know?). Poppy Gagnon, who plays the Christmas-obsessed daughter, really ""pops"" in this- she is so relatable, likeable and enjoyable to watch (and normally I find it hard to ""suspend disbelief"" when watching child actors). Poppy Gagnon is delightful in her role. BOTTOM-LINE: The movie is lighthearted fun & suitable for most viewers, including youngsters. Or in my case, an uplifting movie to enjoy on a rainy COVID day! I give it 8 out of 10 stars for general enjoy-ability and everybody-friendly humour.",The War with Grandpa

180,dizawish,Hollywood just keeps making movies like this every year! [+40%],2,29 August 2020,"Not a lot to recommend here; it's your standard, predictable comedy with a dash of feel-good family vibes. A grandfather and his grandson (seen in the poster) indulge in a turf war for the possession of the latter's room in the house. The storyline itself is an excuse for an occasionally funny, mostly drab comedy aimed at family-friendly audiences. A few scenes did crack me up; that dodgeball sequence being one of them. Walken is a wise addition to have in films like these, while Thurman and Riggle turn out far less amusing than expected.

Uma Thurman shows someone I can relate to. Rob Riggle adds just enough humor, not too annoying, not too childish. Oakley(not sure on spelling) did an AWESOME job in his part of the war. Perfect blend, everything is a perfect blend! I would LOVE to see more of these.",The War with Grandpa

The surprisingly illustrious cast clearly enjoyed themselves on set, and probably enjoyed their pay cheques even more! My highlight was DeNiro, Walken, Cheech and Dr Quinn Medicine Woman taking on some kids at Dodgeball, which is just as silly as it sounds, as it should be.Story wise there's not much here that movie buffs haven't seen done several times before, and done much better, but this movie isn't aimed at movie buffs, judge it for what it is and it'd be a solid choice for a grandparent to watch with their grandkids, or just as a mildly entertaining way for the rest of us to kill 90mins while you mess about on your phone. 6/10",The War with Grandpa

188,franca13,Ugh! Awful!,1,25 September 2021,"There is so much wrong here, it's hard to know where to start. To begin with, a ""nice"" family movie to enjoy with the kids? Really? About the last thing I would ever want my kids to observe is the horrible way this nasty little kid attempts to terrorize, abuse and physically endanger his grandfather for something that is not in his control, like ""stealing"" his room; or the way this poor old guy's controlling daughter takes away his dignity and sense of self-worth by treating him like a pre-schooler and trying to diminish what bit of independence he has left, and think this is a normal and acceptable family dynamic. And to top it all off, the audience is supposed to feel all warm and fuzzy because they occasionally SAY ""I love you"" to each other, when actions clearly dictate the opposite, like that makes all the abuse acceptable. Then there are the scenes where characters run from the law, lie, intimidate children and allow them to think they might be harmed by their grandfathers, illustrate school bullying perpetrated by some troglodytes that looks like they could be tried as adults, etc. I am truly sorry this was so bad, because some of the talent in this film were among my very favorites, ie, DeNiro, Walken, Thurman, but there was so little about it that was redeemable. No matter how Igor hearted you try to dress it up, abuse is never funny, cute, or acceptable, no matter how it's dressed up.",The War with Grandpa

Yes there was a moment where my son thought it looked like a fun idea, but was quickly corrected by his grandad that he took no prisoners and my son changed his mind but honestly, De Niro was his usual funny self. I'm not personally a fan of Uma, she was more grown up and relatable in this to me though, so if you loved her in some of her older stuff maybe don't watch this just to catch up on some Uma time.

199,matty_liverpoolni,I must be getting old,3,21 March 2021,"The cast list for this movie is great, really got me excited. Unfortunately, for me, it just epitomised the quantity over quality movie generation we seem to be living in. It's got to the point where TV / Movies just seems brainless.Take ""Meet the Fockers"" in which Robert De Niro played a similar role. I found it hilarious, even the second time around. The script was well written, you felt something for the characters and most importantly - it was funny! Here, the type of humour is the same but I feel it misses the mark.Plotwise it is lacking too. De Niro's character doesn't want to move in, so the blame is completely misdirected. The parents are to blame for the situation they both find themselves in. Secondly, some of the pranks played on De Niro's character just seemed harsh. Waking a 77 year old up in the middle of the night, slipping on marbles...that's more cruel than funny. Don't get me wrong, there were a few moments that I did laugh (the shaving foam moment, the dodgeball false teeth) but it often felt forced.The acting was also fine, they weren't putting their all into it but that's to be expected for the movie I guess, and it's always great to see Walken do his crazy thing. It's an easy pay check for the three of them.Overall, it's a product of its time, but I do long for the return of movies that don't force you to completely turn the brain off.Bah.",The War with Grandpa

206,nissmike-12179,Good pg movie for fam,10,2 November 2020,Not only is this movie funny it's PG rated and shows kids how to get along with relatives that move in with them.,The War with Grandpa
207,vnkqjxv,Predictable and terrible acting,2,6 December 2020,De Niro's classic charm and acting is not enough to make this movie even slightly watchable. Every other character delivers flat lines with bland humor. Save yourself the time and money and watch a better movie.,The War with Grandpa
208,opreani-68127,Extremely funny,10,11 December 2020,Just an extremely funny movie. Would be nice to have a sequel with more funny parts thats the only thing this movie is missing.,The War with Grandpa
209,lsadler-95427,Just laugh,9,10 April 2021,Good story and really funny. My granddaughter and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Watch it for what it is and laugh.,The War with Grandpa
210,nancyemccloskey,"Plain Stupid, Horrible actor",1,26 December 2020,"I would never watch a movie with
Robert De Niro in it. He's a horrible despicable, nasty human being.",The War with Grandpa
211,msmathews-06925,Liked it! Family friendly.,9,2 January 2021,A little predictable but pretty funny! Good for the whole family to watch!,The War with Grandpa
212,jenesybaby,Hilarious!,10,18 January 2021,I enjoyed this movie so much with my 11 year old! It was hilarious! I hope there's a part 2!!!!,The War with Grandpa
213,sjpprj,LOL,10,17 April 2021,Very very funny. Family movie that will entertain children and adults. We have cried with laughter. What else does a comedy need to be a 10?,The War with Grandpa
214,terdan,Don't watch if you've had your funny bone removed,10,19 December 2020,"This is a comedy, yes mindless Home Alone type humour but belly laugh with tears. If you are a stiff upper lip too afraid to crack a smile type, this isn't for you. If you like family movie type humour ENJOY. I gave it a 10 as delivered exactly as promised and right up my alley.",The War with Grandpa
215,theroadrunner36,"No Oscar winner but who cares, it's hysterical!!!",9,14 April 2021,"No idea what some people were expecting to see with this film but it's clear that some people really need to understand that this film is just fun, fun and a bit more fun.Not every movie is trying to win awards, does that make them bad? No!!",The War with Grandpa
216,nnilsson66,Meh,4,11 October 2020,"This movie was meh. The actors were under utilized, especially Walken and DeNiro. It's ok for a family movie. The kids liked it, and us parents can tolerate it. The pacing was off, and they wedged-in a feel good moment and anti war message that was a little on the nose and preachy.",The War with Grandpa
217,rt9024,Huge disappointment,2,27 October 2020,"As much as I love the cast of this movie, I could not finish watching this and turned it off after the birthday party. So much more could've been done with the script to make this funny even for grown ups. Very disappointing for me",The War with Grandpa
218,jimstringer,Washed up actor with no self control,1,27 February 2021,"Deniro has been a ""has been"" for as long as I can remember. His movies are a waste of time and his character is not deserving of America's attention.",The War with Grandpa
219,strmyskiez,Funniest movie ever,10,6 September 2021,"Clean, funny with my favorite stars. Talent filled!! Thank you for making this movie! It always makes me laugh. Never gets old. Bonus is the fantastic song at the end of you own the movie!",The War with Grandpa
220,tswatl79,This was great!,10,6 June 2021,My favorite part is when they said there's magic in these walls... mmmm mmmm. Aaaaaand when Jennifer screamed Santa's dead!,The War with Grandpa
221,hadzija-sinan,Amazing movie 🎥,10,31 August 2020,It's crazy to see Deniro still so energetic! The best actor of all times!,The War with Grandpa
222,bluenose63,Oh boy,1,30 August 2020,"More than a few top actors in this movie..
One of the worst POS I've Ever seen !!
What motivated these good people to participate in such dross.. Do not watch this movie !!!",The War with Grandpa
223,mikeslife68,Washed up Actor,1,16 October 2020,"Im sorry but all I see when I watch DeNiro is an angry, disrespectful, washed up actor. Not interested in watching him anymore.",The War with Grandpa
224,jennikipoole,Freaking Hilarious,9,30 December 2020,"I LOVE this movie. It's freaking hilarious. XD
Everyone was hilarious. Everyone did a great job acting in my opinion. This movie is also heartwarming, and adorable. Love the references from the movies that Robert De Niro was in back then.",The War with Grandpa
225,andreea-braila,Good laugh with my family,9,2 October 2020,This is a movie for the ones with family. Very nice movie.,The War with Grandpa
226,tbuppm97,Surprisingly funny!,8,22 December 2020,Great family fun. Our entire family enjoyed this simple and enjoyable story that had plenty of good jokes and pranks!,The War with Grandpa
227,wbtkd1,Den Niro,1,15 September 2020,"It's DeNiro, the bully that likes to curse a lot and wants to punch people in the face in real life. Zero interest.",The War with Grandpa
228,SherryMHeard,Actually laughed out loud,9,24 December 2020,"Perfect PG movie! Family friendly. Funny!
DeNiro was PERFECT add Walken & Marin & the combination was very funny!",The War with Grandpa

230,iniciativa,worst movie 2020,1,28 August 2020,"Title says it all, boring, waste of time, not even funny",The War with Grandpa
231,stevelucking,Time I won't get back...,2,25 March 2021,"So bad. After seeing the cast, I thought it can't be that bad... how wrong I was. I didn't even get halfway in before having to turn it off. If you're expecting something as funny as Meet the Fockers, you are going to be miserably disappointed. It doesn't even come close. Not sure it even made me laugh once. The acting is substandard and the plot is looser then my ex-girlfriends underwear.",The War with Grandpa
232,jgannoe,Horrible Writing - no wit whatsoever,2,9 January 2021,Was expecting meet the parents level humor. So bad.,The War with Grandpa
233,abdullah-49910,Don't west ur money and ur time,2,14 October 2020,Ok actually it's was fine not very bad I think it's more forward for children not for adults,The War with Grandpa
234,emilyvalente,Enjoyable but patchy casting,6,24 January 2021,"There were some pretty funny bits; like the part with the senior citz and the condescending supermarket attendant. The ""teenage"" daughter looked about 30, and that was distracting. Also the main kid's (Peter) best friend Steve looked more like the Dad than he did - Also distracting. I enjoyed Chechen, Christopher Walken & Dr Quinn medicine woman teaming up. The dodgy casting of the teenage daughter was pretty annoying though - watching an adult whine like a child -ew.",The War with Grandpa
235,toluwani-86211,Hilarious,10,2 September 2020,The movie was funny and it gave me thrills. Peter's actions shows that he doesn't want peace,The War with Grandpa
236,grumpytrucker-96450,Stupid people,1,19 March 2021,Wonder how much you get paid for typing rubbish reviews 10/10,The War with Grandpa
237,karisebp,Script poorly written,2,26 October 2020,"Two stars in respect to the actors and the production team. The script was poorly written, the war is almost meaningless, the jokes have no timing at all, the film doesn't move or make you laugh enough. That sad. I think it's the worst movie of our dear De Niro.",The War with Grandpa
238,aquamarinesse,Outrageously Ridiculous,3,11 November 2020,"In what Millenial Madhouse would this boy's behaviour EVER be allowed?! Good cast wasted on this unbelievable story. Did something from the book get left on the cutting room floor? The youngest sister's character as well as the grandfather and his pals save the movie from entire failing but it is a difficult watch otherwise.
One does not feel any empathy for the young main character whose self-serving and outright dangerous pranks are the center of this story. Even worse are the parents who turn a blind eye and never reprimand him for any of it or do or say anything to reset his misguided notion.
Unless we missed the part where this kid has somehow become actual part-owner of his home, then he does not have a say about where his bedroom is as should show his grandfather, a war vet at that, the damn respect he's due. And didn't he just recently lose his grandmother as well? You'd never know it from the dangerous and damaging stunts he pulls on his grandfather at a time where we are shown the grandfather is missing his late wife. Not recommended as a family movie at all.",The War with Grandpa
239,albertobd,It is what it is,6,9 April 2021,"You need to know what you are going to watch, it's not an Oscar movie, and if you know that, then you'll say it's very watchable with some really funny moments.",The War with Grandpa
240,chanceherriage,Don't go unless there's someone under 7.,1,14 November 2020,This movie overall feels like it should have been released in 2015.With the odd pacing and flat humor this is definitely not a movie to see unless you plan on falling asleep half way through.,The War with Grandpa
241,leanneec,Pretty funny!,8,20 October 2020,A group of us went who varied in age and tastes in movies. We all enjoyed it. It had lots of laughs. Great movie for tweens too- I find hard to find movies like this since many popular movies are either cartoons or the other end is movies with a ton of swearing and violence.,The War with Grandpa
242,jordy-32189,Simple but joyful comedy! Ignore the bad reviews,10,31 August 2020,"Don't understand the bad reviews here, it is a classic comedy! Had good laughs watching it!",The War with Grandpa
243,melanie-j-49326,Actually surprised me,7,12 January 2021,"Took my daughter along not really knowing what to expect, but it was really good. Entertaining for adults and kids.",The War with Grandpa
244,sfinakiafm,A real feel good movie in this times we live in,10,19 October 2020,A much needed good real laugh is needed once in a while and this movie delivered several good ones. Yea ok it is not an award winning movie and yes it is predictable at times but it made me and my family feel good and that is all it matters.,The War with Grandpa
245,scottnmarcie-78854,Throwing my hat in with the positive reviews!,9,16 January 2021,I'm certain that the negative reviews were from people who were riveted by Manchester by the Sea and also thought Chariots of Fire richly deserved that Best Picture win in '81. 😑 It was lots of fun and the grandkids actually DID put their phones down!,The War with Grandpa
