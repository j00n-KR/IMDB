0,Tweekums,"Lust, Caution",10,20 November 2018,"This spy thriller is set in Japanese occupied China and follows the actions of a resistance cell, in particular one woman, and their attempt to assassinate a senior agent of the puppet regime. The woman is Wong Chia Chi, the man is Mr Yee.The film opens in Shanghai in 1942, shortly before the assassination attempt is to take place before taking us back to 1938. Wong Chia Chi is a member of an acting troupe that has moved to Hong Kong; here she and her friends are first encouraged to make money for the resistance against the Japanese on the mainland. They then learn that Mr Yee is operating in Hong Kong; they determine that it is their patriotic duty to kill the traitor. Even with their acting skills getting close to him is not easy but Wong Chia Chi befriends him; unfortunately he leaves before they can act. Three years later she is reunited with him in Shanghai and as her relationship deepens the resistance start planning how to kill him.When one thinks of resistance fighters in the Second World War one tends to think of those in Europe fighting back against the Germans... it is easy to forget that people were also resisting the Japanese occupation in China. The plot is gripping in a way that reminded me of the works of John Le Carré; the people felt real and the sense of danger was palpably. Director Ang Lee beautifully captured the look of the era and the cast really brought their characters to life. This is particularly true of Tang Wei who excelled as Wong Chia Chi in her debut film role and Tony Leung who impressed as Mr Yee, a character he portrayed as a fairly ordinary person rather than a stereotypical bad guy... even when we see him do terrible things. Much has been made of the films sex scenes but while they are fairly intense they are neither gratuitous nor excessive. There isn't a large amount of violence but a scene where a collaborator is stabbed to death is quite disturbing.","Lust, Caution"
1,Quinoa1984,"not a masterpiece, but it does leave an impression from one of China's sublime modern filmmakers",7,25 October 2007,"Lust, Caution tells its story through the perspective of an actor playing a dangerous game. That Ang Lee, for all of his incredible care to make this a tale with subtleties of an risqué art film and the grace of an old Hollywood love story, puts it through the usual prism of ""back four years earlier"" then ""three years later"" is only a minor distraction. We've seen it so often before, in all kinds of movies, but at least here it's never as terribly boring as some of the detractors would say. And to give credit where it's due, Lee doesn't make it a big pulp of a melodrama like Paul Verhoven did- with very similar material unintentionally- with Black Book. Maybe it's because it's got such a cold tone, where everything is so repressed we don't even really have an idea of who this woman Wang Jiahzi is aside from her aspirations to be an actress (fulfilled, ironically, through the espionage of sorts as Mr. Yee's mistress), and it's a tone without much redemption. While this doesn't mean this adds power to the material, it doesn't ever lift off like Lee at his strongest or visually acute (Ice Storm, Brokeback Mountain).But this said, I don't think you'll find a better movie this year about the topic- and it is a good movie for those who want to take the patience for its 158 minute running time- of deception and lust through tribulations of war. I also liked the whole facet of occupation as the backdrop, that the Japanese are the stranglehold on Japan, but there's still inherent problems within one group by itself. There's always repression through government, so why not through romantic subterfuge? The early section of the film, where we see the burgeoning youth of the drama group as it forms into a group of would-be spies, maybe is a little undercooked emotionally, with the biggest point finally coming with the most explicit scene of violence in the picture (much more staggering than anything one would've seen in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). The second half, however, is when it starts to pick up: Wang has a different name and becomes reacquainted with Mr. Yee after some years not seeing one another. She gets close to him, maybe too close (rough sex starts off their affair, as violent as the murder scene earlier), but with a passion that is piercing.The themes are one thing in Lust Caution, but the performances are another. If not for Tony Leung and newcomer Wei Tang, the film might not have the same emotional wallop; Leung possibly goes head-for-head with his work in Wong Kar Wai's films as his best to date: he's terrifying but, as Wang notes, sort of lonely in his secrecy and security detail. It's be a leap of faith to see how he falls so much in love with the spy (all over one song she sings, you might scoff, though quite a song and a scene), and by the end he plays heartbroken with so much hurt he makes Heath Ledger look like a sap. And Wei Tang, a pretty face to be sure, is an even match as a real newcomer. No matter what can be said about the sex scenes (and yeah, there's a lot to be said, not just about length but about the styles right out of Kama Sutra), it can't be denied the star chemistry. Even with a flawed script, Lee has a cast that works, and a period setting that springs out deception as the most heart-rending drama. As I write this and think it over, the film actually becomes a little better than I remembered too. 7.5/10","Lust, Caution"
2,sunwarrior13,A Classic Movie On Stockholm Syndrome,10,23 September 2011,"This is a great movie.It is one of Ang Lee's best films.It definitely ranks together with Brokeback Mountain.Tony Leung never disappoints.While newcomer,Wei Tang is definitely a charmer.The story was great. It was about Clearly,the Wei Tang character named Wong Chia Chi/Mak Tai Tai,who was suffering from a psychological disorder as she was asked to be a spy for a war collaborator,played excellently by Leung.I do believe that is was a case of a Stockholm Syndrome.Her personal and family background did help contribute to that psychological disorder. This has nothing to do with her being a woman.Stockholm syndrome affects both men and women!!! Some complained about having too many sex scenes.Those scenes were essential not to satisfy perverts but to completely understand Wong Chia Chi/Mak Tai Tai's character;her psychological make-up; and why she did it at the end of the movie.","Lust, Caution"
3,writers_reign,The Lady From Shanghai,7,5 January 2008,"The dirty raincoat brigade are in for a tough time with this one because they're gonna have to sit through the thick end of two hours screen time before we get to the sex scenes that have been hyped by the PR outfits in an effort to 'sell' a movie set in Asia sixty years ago and centering on a political situation virtually unknown in the West. Fortunatelty Ang Lee has a keen eye for period detail and is able to coax fine performances from more or less the entire cast. Beautifully shot, lit, written, acted, this is almost certainly going to be there when the Oscar nominations come around and unlike Atonement which blatantly courted them this one will secure them because it deserves to.","Lust, Caution"
4,lastliberal,Another lasting classic from Ang Lee,10,21 April 2008,"If there was ever a film that hit on all cylinders, this one is it. Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Eat Drink Man Woman) follows up his Oscar winning directorial achievement in Brokeback Mountain (THE best film of 2005) with an even better film about the pains his country went through during the Japanese occupation.He brings back cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, who he used on Brokeback Mountain, and who work had me on the edge of my seat in both films. Alexandre Desplat, who composed music for so many great films - The Queen, Syriana, and many more - gave us a score to remember.The story itself, drawn from just a 26 page short story, was incredibly intense. The sex was equally intense, and necessarily so, as it was the only thing that truly showed the evil of Mr Yee (Tony Leung - Hero, Infernal Affairs). You didn't need to see him torturing prisoners to know that he would fit right in the Bush administration. You could see in the intensity of his sexual activity the evil he brought to his work.Wei Tang as Mai Tai Tai was incredible in her first film. Mark that name as she will be around for a long time.I would not dare to spoil the story for anyone who has not seen this film. If you miss it, it is truly your loss.","Lust, Caution"
5,gradyharp,"Lust, Caution: Acting, Becoming",10,24 February 2008,"Ang Lee has the ability to transform simple stories about human relationships into epic films that somehow maintain the quality of intimacy and tenderness despite the grand sweep of his productions. In LUST, CAUTION ('SE, JIE') he has once again created a symphony of a film with a script by James Schamus based on the short story by Eileen Chang, assembled a cast superb actors who convey the story's multileveled messages on the historic backgrounds of World War II Shanghai and Hong Kong using the sensitive camera eye of Rodrigo Prieto and accompanied by Alexandre Desplat's evocative East/West musical score. It is a visual triumph, a fascinating recounting of China's history about which we know little, and one of the most intriguing love stories committed to film.The film opens in Hong Kong focusing on a group of college students who form a theater group to present plays of 'significance'. Young Wong Chia Chi (the luminous Wei Tang in her first cinematic role) is asked to join the theatrical group and she consents primarily because of her attraction to the leader of the group, Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang, a commanding and handsome actor). Events of history alter the purpose of the art groups and they become a Resistance force against the Japanese occupation of China. The leader of the Japanese sympathizers is a Mr. Lee (Tony Leung, one of the most solid actors on the screen today) and the student group plans an infiltration into his home and life by placing Wong Chia Chi into his household. In residence in Mr. Lee's home, she learns to tolerate the constant mah jong games with Mr. Lee's wife (Joan Chen) and her gossipy girlfriends, only to await the moment when Mr. Lee will notice her and hopefully begin an affair that will result in inside information espionage. As the effects of the war tighten problems the Yees move to Shanghai and the troupe follows them: the troupe has become a committed political resistance force with plans to kill Mr. Yee and the cadre of men who support his siding with the Japanese. Wong Chia Chi agrees to follow Mr. Yee's sexual advances and in short time they are caught up in powerfully erotic explosions of lust: it is during these very frank and very erotic lovemaking scenes that Ang Lee manages to reveal the inner aspects of each of these important characters, allowing the audience to see the complete picture of how lust can dissipate caution. The changes that occur between the two characters set in motion a surprising ending, at once disturbing and understandable.Accompanying the DVD (already in excess of 157 minutes) is a 'making of' feature and a discussion period with not only Ang Lee but also with the stars and production people that is very solid commentary and for once seems pertinent to enhance the enjoyment of the film. Some may find the extended lovemaking scenes too frankly sexual, but so much of the real grit of the story lies in the non-verbal, purely physical language that could only be understood in the way Lee decided to film these gorgeous scenes. This is an important film on many levels and will probably become better appreciated with multiple views. In Mandarin, Japanese, Shanghainese, English and Hindi with subtitles.

6,DICK STEEL,"A Nutshell Review: Lust, Caution",8,3 October 2007,"Early in the movie, Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei) gets asked to act in a patriotic play, in a time when China was threatened by the Japanese Invasion during the late 30s/early 40s. Little does she know that she's got to carry on acting the rest of her life, together with her group of idealistic young dramatists, as stage feelings stirred up real emotions that calls for the sacrificial of self for the greater good, for the country. What they lack in experience, they make up with their youthful passion and exuberance. And their rawness shows in the way they clumsily set up their traps for the coming of the prey, and fumbling even with their first blood.Welcome to Lee Ang's world of espionage. It's not glam, and gets draped in many real world sense and sensibilities. We enter a world where Trust and Loyalty are difficult to come by, and with shadows lurking in every corner, waiting to pounce at the slightest of mistakes. But the darkness is beautifully captured, and like its endless rounds of mahjong, you're waiting for that perfect tile to come your way, for the opportune to present itself, for the East Wind to come about. That's how this movie's espionage theme is played out, with plenty of waiting. Instant results and instant gratification do not come easy, and even the finale I found to be less than satisfying, though it provided subtle avenues to keep your imagination running as to how the turn of events have greatly affected the usually cautious Mr Yee (Tony Leung).Like the movie, Leung's Mr Yee remains an enigma we are trying to have a crack at, trying to, like the rest, understand his secret life. He sneaks around from fort to fort, always with protection, and has this solid wall build around his personal life, that even his wife (Joan Chen) finds hard to break, and letting it be anyway, enjoying luxurious life as a tai-tai. All we know about Yee, is that he's a Chinese traitor in the employment of the Japanese, while enjoying immense power under the protection of his master, readily bolts like a running dog that he is in the first signs of trouble.Enter Tang Wei's Chia Chi, in a strategy hundreds of years old, and that is to use the lure of the beauty to provide the downfall of powerful generals. As a fresh faced ingénue, she enters the dangerous cat and mouse game at great personal sacrifice, probing cautiously (that's the word again) into the life of Mr Yee, and casting those come hither eyes as bait to lure her prey, relying on others to provide the finishing blow and save her from his evil roaming clutches. In order to enter his circle of trust, she has to play to the sadistic sexual fantasies (you see, I don't think he gets any from Mrs Yee anyway) of a repressed man using her as an avenue to release those pent up rage and frustrations from work, where his job as we know is to interrogate fellow countrymen. It's not a glam job, especially when you're casting your lot with the underdogs.Lust, Caution is a tale of two lonely people, forced by circumstances to do what they have to. One, to fulfill her ideology and get rid of possibly one of the most dangerous man to the Chinese, while the other, looking for honest companionship. It's falling for and sleeping with the enemy both ways, and in a time where trust is hard pressed, this makes everything more complex, especially when it comes to irrational emotions that overrule logic and guard. It's layered with plenty of betrayals whichever way you look at it, and the narrative kept pace by unfolding eachlayer intricately. Which makes it ultimately a very sad love that couldn't be story, the perennial fib to reality.Tony being Tony, I can't help but think that with his hair slicked back, and his stoic demeanor in well pressed suits, look the more vengeful version of his Mr Chow from In the Mood for Love, though this time round he really gets it on with another married woman Mrs Mak, Chia Chi's alter-ego. He might be sleepwalking through his role here, as he speaks very little and does even less, but comes alive in his scenes toward the end. LeeHom is rather wooden though as the de-factor youth leader, and his romantic moments with Tang Wei just falls flat given that it's not fully developed here, if not for the focus of love between Mr Yee and Mrs Mak.Like how Lee Ang shot Zhang Ziyi to prominence with her role in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as a headstrong young woman who comes of age, Tang Wei snags a role as such and it wouldn't be much of a surprise should she gain acclaim and recognition for her role here. She switches between the greenhorn student and one who's living a lie quite easily, and she exhibits linguistic skills (English, Cantonese, Mandarin and even Shanghainese) and even talent for song. Watch those eyes of hers, and her rant during breaking point, excellent stuff.Lust, Caution is an espionage story that works, and being set in a tumultuous era helped loads in the eagerness and sense of urgency required, and how patience in getting everything set up for that one shot one kill opportunity makes it a constant tussle, both for the characters, and how events get played out.","Lust, Caution"
7,KineticSeoul,Sex and lies,7,17 October 2009,"The casting of this movie was terrific with Tony Leung giving a divine and intimidating performance. It's basically a ""espionage thriller"" about a group of Chinese student her are trying to take down a Chinese traitor or a collaborator played by Tony Leung by tempting him with a girl and earning his trust. It's a haunting film that may depress you at times, still the beginning of the film was good but afterward it starts to get tedious and drag a bit, maybe to make the running time longer so Ang Lee can make it longer or something, there is a lot of sex scenes in this film but it felt meaningful since it brought lust into the characters. It was heartbreaking to see a innocent girl give away that innocence to reach her goal although she didn't seem to mind. This is a tragic espionage film with lust and good character development and how desperate times comes desperate measures cause the characters in the film really starts to change gradually. The reason I give it a 7.3 is cause the end will make you feel like the rest of the film was pointless, even if they were trying to go a more haunting approach to it. The ending is up to the viewers judgment if it was love or just lust although I am leaning more to lust even if to Wong Chia Chi it was love even if she was smart enough to know that Mr. Yee didn't really love her in return.***Maybe Spoilers*** It was a decent touch to see YuMin Kuang and his peers end up being the true bad guys in the film even if throughout they thought they were doing the right thing and at the end I thought they got what they deserved, I felt bad for Wong Chia Chi.7.3/10","Lust, Caution"
8,dromasca,a story of love and betrayal in times of war,7,6 February 2009,"Ang Lee's characters in his last movies are doomed to live intense and unhappy stories that defy the social conventions and cannot end but in tragedy. After 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Se, jie' whose English translation (dont't know how accurate) is 'Lust, Caution' deals with a love story that is born out of revenge, or more exactly politically motivated. She is a Chinese student, amateur actress and patriot, involved with the resistance movement against the Japanese invaders and their Chinese collaborators during the second World War. He is a Chinese collaborator dignitary, a tortionist and a criminal that the group of students she belongs to decide to kill, first as a spontaneous mean of expressing their patriotism, later after the first tentative fails as part of the national fight against the enemy. In order to attract the well guarded collaborationist in the trap, she enters a relationship that will consume both of them.A few words about the cinematography of this film. Ang Lee is a master of beautiful cinema and of directing actors to the very last detail of their emotions. Every scene he is creating is beautiful esthetically, is true historically and makes justice to the story telling and to the actors. It is obvious that he enjoyed bringing to screen the world of Shanghai and Hong Kong of the 1940s, a world which almost completely disappeared physically in the many decades of wars and revolutions that stormed China since, a world which can exist today only in books or works of art as this one. From this perspective Ang Lee fully succeeded with this film, he may have created the equivalent of what Casablanca is for the Western audiences when relating to the cinematographic image of the world in war. The city of Shanghai at war, its streets, people, rain, lights at night and at day come to life at screen as a beautiful and expressive kaleidoscope.Tony Leung and Wei Tang are fantastic actors, but here we encounter the emotional limits of the story, which I felt are the weaker part of the film. Wei Tang's character starts as an innocent girl, attracted to revolution first by the charismatic figure of one of her fellows, and then starting to live a double life as revolutionary and bourgeois coquette. Slowly her relationship with the monstrous Mr. Yee becomes more true than her real life. From an inexperienced girl she becomes a woman involved in and intense relationship, which is a combination of love and hate, sex and attraction between two people that have little reason to be anything but enemies. This is where the story lacks emotional credibility. He has all reasons to suspect her, and yet seems to fall into believing in the sincerity of her feelings, despite behaving as evil even in some of his private moments. If I could somehow understand this, I completely failed to believe her reasons of fascination, that lead her to the ultimate betrayal. Director Ang Lee and actor Tony Leung fail to explain the motives of her fascination and betrayal. The sordid end where she prefers to share the fate of her comrades adds a beautiful dimension to the character, but yet there is something pathetic and unresolved in the way we are driven as viewers to that end. Maybe the English title (not sure if also the Chinese one) can answer the riddle, maybe it was just a story of lust, one of these stories we as mortals should be cautious about.","Lust, Caution"
9,secondtake,"A dramatic, nostalgic, breakthrough film trapped in familiar Western cinematic clothes",8,8 March 2010,"Lust, Caution (2007)The production values are so high, the drama so obviously layered in World War II tensions, and the romance so predictably intense and conflicting, this is a movie that has to succeed. But it also dwells on its successful moments. Love scenes are longer than the effect (of seeing their genuine passion of flesh and mind) requires. A murder takes even longer than Tarantino might draw out. And all those between moments seem wonderful and sometimes unnecessary, with a really gorgeous 1940s China recreated as people walk, drive, and ride through streets, or sit and play mahjong in light drenched interiors.Make no mistake, this is a serious, moving experience once you get absorbed. Right from the restrained first scenes you'll know that this will drip in nostalgic beauty, which in its way is enough to keep you watching. The band of rebels who anchor the plot, and who form the shell around the lead female character, are slightly caricatured, but they have disarming sweetness, and maybe a slightly distant feel for an American viewer, that it comes off as foreign in the best sense. In fact, much of the movie comes of as a foreign film made for American eyes (whether that was or is true at all). There are deliberate cues to history (some American weapons) or to English (she goes to a restaurant where they, by some miracle, speak to her in English, and she, by another sleight, returns in the same language). But this makes the bigger effect accessible, and maybe, by some small step of logic, more sympathetic. Or so it would follow.All of this deliberate film-making savvy and subtlety has a way of getting in the way of the movie and its high stakes plot really slamming you in, making you worry and sweat, and wanting you to talk about it all later. Even the slightly surprising end, with the final sadness in the last look in the person's eyes (I can't say who) is calculated. And familiar. When Kurosawa was making Japanese films with a Western tilt, he was also breaking all rules in the art and achieving a high level of artistry not touched here. This is a genre film, with a Western tilt, adopting the cinematic language and the narrative tropes we know too well.Is it a great movie anyway? In parts, at times. I rate it highly, but with the reservations.","Lust, Caution"
10,tabuno,Missed Opportunity,6,21 January 2019,"4 May 2008. Suggestions of elegant character and cultural study of Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) and action thriller of Point of No Return (1993) infuse Lust Caution. Unfortunately Ang Lee is unable to transform this these blended genres into a satisfying whole. The characters themselves seem underdeveloped, particularly the editing in the first half of the movie that seems to jump erratically and the smooth understanding of the evolution of these characters do not fleshed out in a meaningful and understandable way. The wasted initial scene and then flashback could have better been put to use in more focus on the transformation of the characters into older versions of themselves. The movie doesn't evoke sympathy for any of the characters nor really the authenticity required to feel for these characters. At the same time oddly enough perhaps in attempting to avoid predictable stereotypes, the movie lost its action thrilling opportunities. There were several strong scenes, the stabbing scene that appeared to present a new and perhaps even realistic version of the slaughter of innocents and of course the climax of the movie that was inevitably expected from the beginning of the movie. The erotic, almost sadomasochismic angle may have been too distancing are motive in the connection between two people as opposed to the traditional qualitative emotional connection that one experiences in Memoirs of a Geisha. Six out of Ten Stars.","Lust, Caution"
11,ironhorse_iv,Watch this erotic lust full espionage flick with caution. It's worth checking out.,7,14 February 2014,"Directed by Ang Lee, 'Se, Jie' AKA Lust, Caution is based on the novella of the same name by Chinese author Eileen Chang which is in turn based on a short story called The Spyring. The film adaptation and the novel are loosely based on events that took place during the Japanese occupation of Shanghai during World War 2, where a group of Chinese university students plot to assassinate a high-ranking special agent/recruiter of the puppet government Mr. Yee (Tony Leung) by using an attractive young woman, Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei) to lure him into a trap. Interestingly, the story is closely rendition that of Eileen Chang's own real love life. In which she fell in love with a Chinese traitor during WW2. Like the story, their separation fell apart due to the betrayal. Chang wrote the book in 1950's Shanghai, not long before she fled China for fear of political persecution. The film has many modifications by Ang Lee for example, the explicit sex scenes that cause the movie to be rated NC-17 in the US markets. Being NC-17, cause many theaters not to carry the film, and limited the access to the viewing public. I wouldn't say, this movie doesn't belong in the NC-17 field, but for the most part. I have saw, much worst from other strong 'R' films; that clearly deserve to be NC-17. I wouldn't say this movie is for anybody would get uncomfortable about the topic of sex, nor do I think it's for any love story romantic lovers. The movie focus more on dangerous and painful of intimacy. This movie has some scenes that will be disturbing to certain people such as violent rape, S&M, and others. If the sex scenes were more passion based on love, maybe I would say, put the film with a title of R, but since most of the sex scenes are violent and graphic. I think NC-17 is what this movie deserves. The sex sequences could had been taking out or been cut down. This movie would just fine without them. There is a lot of erotic espionage thrillers films that work without going to the extremes. A good example is Alfred Hitchcock's 1946's film 'Notorious' that has a similar plot or better yet 2006's German film, Black Book. While, the sex scenes are explicit; it's not borderline useless filler porn. It only makes up about ten minutes of total screen time. Altogether there are only three or four scenes that contain sexual content or nudity within this two and a half hour movie. I think the violence mixed with the sex is hard to watch. It does do tell a lot about the characters. The cruel actions tells how terminally paranoid the man is. Chi shows, how mentally disturb, Chi is, by enjoying the sexual abuse cause against her. Some critics might hate the film due to the fact, that Chi falls in love with the man she's supposed to kill to the point that. The movie has this wonderful suspense, making you wonder if Chi will go on, with the assassinating plot or not. The movie does kinda drawn out the pace, but it did lose my interest, a bit between the time in Hong Kong and then the time in Shanghai. The violent in the film for one pervasive murder sequence is pretty bloody. It just as disturbing as the rape scenes. The acting in this movie is pretty good. Wei is just great, playing, both the innocent country girl with little sexual experience, and later as the sexy seducer. Tony Leung pretty much born to play dark brooding characters, so in this film. He doesn't really bring anything new with this role. I don't see him playing against type. Tony Leung portrays someone completely opposite of his usual characters. I doubt that. The sets are beautiful and looks like the time in which the story is place. The camera work by Rodrigo Prieto is amazing. The music by Alexandre Desplat's has this East meet West dramatic tone to it. While the movie isn't dub into English. The subtitles work with understanding the Chinese culture as a whole during this brutal realism period. The movie also hints a brief reference of a play by Doll's House by Henrick Ibsen of the dark times for women rights, then. In the play, a woman is unable to find herself, due to being control in a male domination world. The character of Wong Chia Chi is somewhat like that. She was abandoned by her father-figure, then forced by war into service by whoring by a mostly male patriotism companionship. She was already self-defeat before she met Mr. Yee. Then in the end, tragedy hits when she tries to choose her own path. The ending is shows the tragic consequence of how lust can made a person forget about their own safety and not focus on caution. The China version is a little bit, different than the American one in the ending. Make sure to look for the 2008 DVD with the NC-17 version, which includes ten minutes of footage not allowed by the MPAA to run during the original theatrical run. It's hard to watch, at first, but after multiple views, you can see that there is more to the film than a graphic controversial well-publicized sex scenes.","Lust, Caution"
12,johnnyboyz,Simply brilliant study of two people of different strengths whilst using the time of war as a scoped backdrop.,8,26 September 2008,"Lust and caution; two words, indeed verbs, that are perfect for summing up the general feeling, atmosphere and tension Ang Lee's film carries. But it's not a gratuitous film despite the graphic nature of the sex scenes; make no mistake that the focus here is not on the exploitation of those scenes but rather the building to these scenes and then the ramifications that happen because of these scenes and how one person can be driven to entrust the opposite of why it all went down in the first place. Much like Paul Verhoeven's Black Book from the previous year, the most expensive Dutch film ever made, Lust, Caution uses war as its backdrop and false love and sex as its catalyst for grander things.War films in general are, or should be, about an individual in a crisis that (usually) he shares with several others in a scenario that could spell certain death at any one time. The best war films I find, are studies of an individual's psychosis and mental state given what's going on such as madness in Apocalypse Now; desperation in The Deer Hunter and the will to raise questions over the sensibility of orders and those ranked higher than you in Saving Private Ryan. Lust, Caution is more so a study of trust which is a psychological emotion and the lead character's frontline is not a trench or a jungle but the enclosed spaces of motel rooms and private quarters.Although essentially a love story, the film allows itself to be inspired by the espionage genre as well. Set during the Second World War in Shanghai, China; the film allows certain resistance groups to be set up; arguments between those members to form and ideas and missions to fabricate at their own pleasing pace. The film is a study of individuals without ever allowing the wartime setting to bog it down. The two individuals involved are Wong Chia Chi (Wei Tang) and Mr. Yee (Leung). The studies of these two people ignore formula in the sense that when you analyse what and who they are towards the very end of the piece, it does not feel too dissimilar to what they were at the very beginning. What has changed is all in the mind and is most apparent in terms of respect they have for one another.As characters, Wong Chia Chi is vulnerable and somewhat naïve at the beginning; volunteering bravely but perhaps foolishly to try and infiltrate the home of the enemy. Mr Yee is quite the opposite in the sense he is powerful not only in name but by appearance, certainly in the early sex scenes with Wong Chia Chi where he must dominate her, immediately establishing himself as the dominant half of the relationship. But the clever manner in which this progresses is by just how similar they are towards the end of the film. During their future rendez-vous, the meetings will turn more towards intercourse than anything else with beatings and the ripping of clothes already establishing who is in charge.Towards the end, we still get the feeling Mr. Yee is as powerful as he was at the beginning but because we have now spent time with him I think director Ang Lee assumes a lot of us will think he'll try to pull the wool over our eyes. Instead, he resists presenting Yee as a cheery and now 'happy' individual when really he remains the stone cold official that he is only now with a woman he is able to spend time with and purchase diamond rings for. Equally so as a character, Wong Chia Chi retains those somewhat innocent characteristics predominantly through the fact she is still undercover but her emotions and true feelings are being toyed with all the time as her moment of realisation and the film's dramatic final event in their relationship looms closer.Although one thing stands out amongst most everything else and that's the attention to the lead role of Wong Chia Chi. As a character she will eventually be strong and brave and for a film to contain so much sexual content and yet from my viewing not shoot its leading lady in an objective or derogatory manner is impressive. This is not exploitation but indeed a journey. Take the scenes involving Mah Jong in which several women sit around a table and play. They are submissive; they stay there all day and play it, kept away from more 'important' things that the males take care of. Enter our star Wong Chia Chi; a strong and brave person who is out and about and shouldn't really be there in the first place. She cannot play the game; she sheds the image of the submissive female role by refusing to engage in the game of Mah Jong, something the other women cannot do.To include the game of Mah Jong as a pit-stop of sorts, identifying the roles of women within the world of the film, indeed perhaps within China at that time, and making sure we understand what roles are being played out here is practically flawless direction from Ang Lee. By the end, I feel we are led to forget everything about the war going on since actual love is blooming but Ang Lee doesn't let us escape and the nasty reminder that there is still war going on is shoved back in our faces with a heartbreaking finale. It's probably already been said but from one unconventional love story in Brokeback Mountain to another, Ang Lee excels with Lust, Caution; another tail of forbidden love with horrible consequences.","Lust, Caution"
13,jzappa,Can an Act of Lust Exist Harmoniously With an Act of Caution?,10,1 April 2009,"Ang Lee has always had an instinct for characterization. He may not always penetrate to the core of many of his characters; he certainly doesn't here. But he gives us some of the most well-defined shells of personalities that can be found in the majority of films. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai has the perfect dispositional approach for a character like Mr. Yee, a Japanese collaborationist whose inner life we may have never known anyway. He is the sort whose truest layers can be assumed unknown by anyone close to him, and we read that from the external text we are given. But the story as a whole is a serpentine thicket of dual-ended motivations, minds exploding with indecision and conflicted, disagreeable animal lust, all but the last of which can only be emotionally detected. The central character, a woman played by the steamily, submissively sexy Tang Wei, a sort of babe in the woods to such an intensely divided society in which the story is set that surrounds her. Whether intentionally or not, Lee's aesthetic choices distinctly feel as if to reflect her defensive external persona throughout the film, always remaining on the superficial, almost meaningless scenic beauty, fashion and etiquette of the world around her and not even setting direct sight or attention on the surrounding mayhem of the time, except in one scene in which our heroine has no choice but to deal with it like the rest. Only one thing can be for sure: If given any single smidgen of evidence of any kind that would show one or the other reason to belief they are dangerous enemies, there would be not a single nanosecond of hesitation to react. Believe me, you'll see.We open with a strikingly well-filmed Mah-Jongg game. The dialogue is tight, and the camera implicates the players focused on all the game's details no matter what they talk about, foreshadowing the very kind of mental stalemate that permeates the center of the plot's relationships. It's taking place in the home of Mr. Yee, played by the powerful Hong Kong star Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, whose wife, Lost's Joan Chen, is hosting the get-together. From the beginning of their coming from Shanghai, he has moved up in the collaborationist government, and his Tony Leung disposition is utilized presumably as an intimidation tactic for inquisitions and tortures, and is rewarded smug social standing and thus such lower- class rareties as nylon stockings, cigarettes, not to mention diamonds. When Mr. Yee comes home in the middle of the game, he instigates an intuitive exchange of looks with Mrs. Mak, the gently temperate actress Tang Wei, who first rubbed shoulders with the clique in Shanghai.It's logically evident to us there's something clandestine and even illicit between them. But who is this socially embroidered Mrs. Mak, who cruises in a hired car but whose husband is perpetually away on business? We don't quite know what's going on till half an hour in. And then we still don't know, but we have a better external idea. But what is internal is kept obscure.We do not see Mr. Yee at work, torturing his cultural kin, but Leung shades the man's capacity for violence and uses Mrs. Mak as an object for violent release in bed with her. Then come the scenes that got the film caught by the NC-17 monster. They are not tangibly hard core in detail, but afford so many puzzling, at times perhaps unaccountable gymnastic sexual positions that the MPAA's pact of silence upon the presentation of ""thrusting"" is in effect from the first shot.When their sex parallels affectionately with violence, the inherence of their chemistry goes through a kind of agreed-upon metamorphosis. No viewer can be marksman enough to say for certain that Mrs. Mak likes his proclivities for sadism and tying her up with their low- class rareties, but they develop a formidable relationship that, for both of them, expands their respective lives, which each believes is unknown to the other, which may or may not be true. And it is that tug of war, between individual infatuation and social peril, that gives the movie its significance.Mr. Yee and Mrs. Mak are just as transgressive as the lovers in Ang Lee's previous film Brokeback Mountain, just as entrenched in a kind of sex that is vilified by their insulated social environments. The actuality of the sex itself is Lee's focus here, and he's too honorable to neuter his vision under the intimidation of the MPAA's puritan strait-jacket. His incidental instants of full frontal nudity defy the unnatural fundament of most movie sex scenes in which the lovers, together or by themselves, strategically hide their gonads from sight. Yet, the scenes are not edited for sexiness exploitation, it must be noted, but are handled in the context of their intellectual message.","Lust, Caution"
14,Vartiainen,Tedious,5,7 August 2015,"The main problem with this Ang Lee period espionage love story is that it drags. With a running time of two and a half hours, yet with a plot that can be summed up with a couple of words, it overstays its welcome sooner or late, depending on the patience of its viewer. It's a fine film by most other measures, but even a good film can turn sour if it simply keeps going and going.The story follows the life of an university student Wang Jiazhi (Tang Wei) during the years leading up to and during the World War Two in China. She ends up joining a bunch of other rebellious youths who want to strike back against Japanese oppressors. In this particular case using Jiazhi's sexuality as a weapon against a Chinese collaborator. Good basic idea, but you cannot really see two and a half hours's worth of material in that, can you.Ang Lee is a prolific director for a reason and it shows in this film as well. It is shot beautifully, most of the actors give great performances and the production values are topnotch. Definitely a film to check out if you're a die-hard fan of him.But, it drags. It drags so bad. And that is why I have to rate it as just below average. If you're a fan of films that take their time and allow for a lot of atmosphere and mood buildup, then this is definitely your film. But, if you like your films mostly under or around two hours, you might want to reconsider.","Lust, Caution"
15,Turfseer,More production design than psychological depth in period piece about Japanese occupied China,5,9 May 2011,"With excellent cinematography, impeccable direction, a haunting score and top-notch performances, why is 'Lust, Caution', such a ho-hum affair? For starters, so much of it is stretched out that we end up with only tidbits of compelling drama. This film could have and would have worked a lot better had about 45 minutes of celluloid found its way on to the cutting room floor.'Lust, Caution' is divided into two parts. The first part is set in Hong Kong in 1938, before the Japanese have occupied all of China. Leehom Wang does well in his first acting performance as Kuang Yu Min, a radical student at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. He conscripts a pretty, shy co-ed, Wong Chia Chi, to act in a patriotic play, designed to inflame the passions of a Chinese audience, who naively believe that they can defeat the Japanese, who are on the verge of taking over the entire country. Chia Chi is so successful in moving the audience to tears that Kuang becomes convinced that she could assist him and his acting group turned real-life conspirators, in a plot to assassinate Mr. Yee, a local party chief affiliated with the Wang Jingwei puppet government in mainland China. Kuang concludes that only Chia Chi can infiltrate Yee's organization and perhaps help facilitate his assassination.Chia Chi assumes the identity of Mrs. Mak, the wife of an import-export dealer and is introduced to Mrs. Yee, the wife of the intended target. While we're expecting some kind of exciting, assassination attempt by Kuang and his confederates in the first hour of the film, that never materializes as Mr. and Mrs. Yee unexpectedly move back to Shanghai. What we are treated to during the first hour is a long-winded sequence of ""Mrs. Mak"" playing Mahjong with Mrs. Yee and her social circle, Chia Chi being deflowered by one of Kuang's co-conspirators in order to gain some skill in seducing Mr. Yee and the clumsy murder of Tsao, one of Yee's subordinates, who pays a visit to the Kuang and company as they are packing up their bags following Yee's sudden departure from Hong Kong.While the conspirators are supposed to be the 'good guys', Ang Lee makes the point that they're really no better than Mr. Yee, who both use Chia Chi as a sex object. When she's forced to lose her virginity in such a mechanical way, Kuang wants her to understand that this is her service to a greater cause—at the same time, he does nothing to comfort her and worse, express any deep-felt feelings he has for her. All this only serves to harden Wong who later betrays the group. The betrayal at the film's climax is foreshadowed by the group's awkward attempt to train Wong as a seductress—this is where she really loses her enthusiasm for the group's cause.The second part of of 'Lust, Caution, takes place four years later in Shanghai. Kuang now is an undercover agent for the KMT, which seeks to undermine Japanese occupation rule and the Chinese puppet government. With her past contacts with Mr. Yee and his wife, Chia Chi again is able to infiltrate the Yee inner circle. This time she becomes Yee's mistress and most of the film deals with Yee and Chia Chi's relationship. Yee is first depicted as a sadist as he rapes Chia Chi during their first sexual encounter. Gradually he warms up to her and by film's end, he's buys her a very expensive diamond ring. By concentrating on the sexual relations between the two, Ang Lee sacrifices any chance to develop Yee's character. He's played by Tony Leung Chiu-Wai who desperately tries to humanize Yee by showing his tender side during love-making (although he's afraid of the dark, Yee eventually allows Chia Chi to place a towel over his eyes, connoting some vulnerability). But we surely would have liked to know more about Yee—for example, what does he exactly do in his job as head of the secret police? (I think that's a lot more interesting than all those sex scenes that go on ad infinitum). Why not more like the scene in the Japanese district where Yee confides to Chia Chi that he really despises the Japanese and their cause is lost? Now that's ambiguity (and we needed a lot more of that!).As for Chia Chi, her failure to help the good guys, is meant to be seen as tragic. While Mr. Yee plays with her emotions, she begs the KMT to act before she becomes an emotional basket case. Due to 'strategic concerns', Chia Chi is told to wait and before you know it, she's fallen for 'bad boy' Yee, hook, line and sinker. Lee seemingly sees her as a victim of a male chauvinistic society. Others might view her as a weak woman who had a job to do during wartime and betrayed her confederates, resulting in their tragic death.Chia Chi warns Mr. Yee at the film's denouement and he escapes with his life. I had no objection to Ang Lee trying to avoid a sentimental, happy ending. Given the time period the film is set in, there actually weren't too many happy endings for Chinese people under the Japanese occupation. Nonetheless, it sure takes us a long time to get there. But even if you're willing to go along with the film's glacial pacing, one is struck by the fact that this is not a film that appeals to the intellect. Rather, it's a film that relies merely on the sexual chemistry between the principals without bothering to virtually flesh out any other element of their personalities. The same can be said for the supporting players (the conspirators) who we find out next to nothing about.For all its wonderful atmosphere, 'Lust, Caution' serves up only a few surprises; along the way, its characters remain ciphers who we can hardly become involved with.","Lust, Caution"
16,Chris Knipp,Such a long wait for such a flat result,8,25 November 2007,"Ang Lee likes to try different things. He made The Ice Storm, and The Hulk. And Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. And right after Brokeback Mountain--which, as Nathan Lee memorably declared in Film Comment, gave ""millions of 'mos on the planet. ""in no uncertain terms, the epic romantic tragedy straight people have taken for granted all their lives""--Lee has given us the constipated, dryly ""shocking"" historical hetero thriller, Lust,Caution--a film that ultimately seems ironically accurate in its name.This adaptation of a long Eileeen Chang story is a movie about Chinese spies under 1940's Japanese occupation focused on a heterosexual affair that is not epic and is without love or tragedy or romance or even sexiness. It is a tragedy, or a tragic waste of time for a young doomed woman, Wang Jia-hi (newcomer Tang Wei) and her group of young provincial actors who want to kill Chinese collaborators. Jiajhi, masquerading as somebody else of more bourgeois background, has an affair with Tony Leung Chiu Wai's collabo police chief, Mr. Yee.Their sex scenes are (sort of) brutal and (sort of) graphic--enough for an NC-17 rating but not enough to be shocking or a turn-on (as if brutality or overtness were any key to that); and the sex, however unconventional, in the staid historical context it may be, doesn't begin till a lot of screen time has passed. Ang Lee's scenes are (generically) handsome and finely crafted as always, but his pace is leaden. If he wanted to give straight love a bad name compared to the excitement that so briefly but memorably happens between Jake and Heath, he succeeded. That certainly was not his conscious intention, but the painful literalism of Lee's sex scenes this time are like the Kama Sutra acted out by gawky, self-conscious teenagers.The obvious interest of Jiajhi's story isn't in any physicalityor even in the suspense and danger, but in how a Mata Hari lover who's a virgin when she and her young actor troupe hatch their plan (comically, she must learn sex from a guy whose limited experience is with prostitutes)--discovers this is, like it or not, the love of her life--and how long and how terribly she might struggle with that realization. How can she be jaded or objective? How does she deal with the awful combination of love and hate she's saddled with? But the young actress, though game, isn't subtle; and Lee gets too involved in mahjong-playing ladies, handsome interiors, shiny cars, and complex street scenes, all of which, especially the street scenes, are wonderfully crafted in their dry, pretty way but not essential to the story.Also detrimental is the choice of Leung, who's already been far cooler and more romantic in various Wong Kar Wai classics. What we need is an actor who's more cruel, more venial, more physical, less long-suffering and ascetic and elegant, for this role--someone who would seem more scary and sensual throwing Jiajhi around in bed. Too much caution, not enough lust. When Jiajhi's handsome young acting mentor, Kuang Yu Min (Wang Lee-hom), finally kisses her, Jiajhi says, ""You could have done that three years ago."" That's the trouble with the whole movie. It takes too long and says too little to us and its ending is flat. So much beauty, so much elegant film-making, for such a pinched and constipated result: it's a real pity. Rent Wong's In the Mood for Love instead.","Lust, Caution"
17,freemantle_uk,"Sex, lies and the Chinese Resistance",9,30 November 2008,"Ang Lee is one of those directors who likes to try his hand at any genre of cinema: with Lust, Caution he decided to make a historical spy film set in Japanese occupied Japan.The film tells the story of Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei), an attractive woman from Shanghai and studying in Hong Kong. She becomes involved in the bleak world of espionage and resistance. Chia Chi was a student at Hong Kong university where she becomes involved with a patriotic threate group who try and raise money for the resistance back on the mainland. After some success the leader of the group, Kuang Yumin (Wang Lee-Hom), comes into contact with a senior agent for the Chinese puppet government, Mr. Yee (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai). Here the group turns from passive to active, and plan to kill Mr. Yee whilst he was in Hong Kong. Here they need Chia Chi, with the aim that she can seduce him and give them a chance to murder. However, Mr. Yee and his wife are called back to Shanghai before the deed could be committed. After a violence murder of one of Mr. Yee bodyguards Chia Chi flee the group and end up in Shanghai after the Japanese invade Hong Kong. Three years later Chia Chi is living with her aunt and trying to continue with her studies. However she ends up meeting up with Kuang, who became an agent for the resistance. He introduces her to a senior leader of the resistance and they tell her that Mr. Yee was promoted, and became the head of the intelligence service in Shanghai. Because of his rank it was impossible to get near him because of the security around him. Chia Chi was needed because of her previous relationship and so could get need him, so that they could gather intelligence. However, Chia Chi and Mr. Yee become closer and start to form a very complex relationship.Lust, Caution is a very complex film. It's complex on two levels, first the intelligence and historical side, looking at a lot of aspects during the Second World War. The other aspect, and the more important aspect, is the look on character, personality and relationships. The film asks questions on what's more important, love for you country or a person. This was not a action-packed film, don't except James Bond or Jason Bourne. It's deeper, more subtle, and more about the relationships and slow ground work that needs to be done. They are also psychological looks on the film, what it means to become a spy and use someone for your own eyes. As well the characters, the film also takes a look at the occupation of Shanghai and the worries of war in Hong Kong and Shanghai. It is stated that they were shortages on very thing, including rice and petrol. As well, the Chinese resistance do murder Japanese sympathiser and bomb important targets, but at the same time, many citizens try and continue with their normal life. Life was more passive, compared to say Iraq in recent years.This film was extremely well written, brilliantly acted. It was tense and Ang Lee was able to direct the film with skill, adding to the tension.To faint-hearted people it should be warned that this film has some violence scenes, and some very graphic sex scenes, bordering on pornography. They is one scene inparticalarly which is hard to stomach, with some very violence sex.If you like this film, I also recommend the Dutch film Black Book, which look at similar themes and has a similar plot.","Lust, Caution"
18,st-shot,Last Tango in Singapore.,8,9 November 2007,"Lust, Caution is a well made joyless melodrama set in Japanese occupied China during World War Two. Wang Jiazhi has been deserted by her father who has run off to Europe and married an Occidental. She then joins a politically motivated theatre group which fills the void created by her father's abandonment. Reluctantly she agrees to take part with the group whose idealism has now turned to direct action in an attempt to assassinate a Japanese collaborator during their summer vacation. The collaborator, Mr. Yee is a stoic official, whose duties hinted at seem to be of a gruesome nature. The first attempt to kill Yee is badly bungled and when blood is shed Wang Jiazhi abandons the group. Years pass and the occupation continues when Wang re-ups with the revolutionaries. She once again takes on the role of seductress in order to trap Yee but instead becomes seduced by his ""unorthodox charm"". With Lust, director Ang Lee has made the Chinese equivalent of Last Tango in Paris and The Night Porter. The passionate but ambiguous relationship shared between Yee and Jiazhi resembles closely the doomed lovers (lusters?) in both of these films. With thirty plus years hindsight on both of these works it breaks no new ground in the West. China is another story though and I believe this will cause quite an uproar with censors on the mainland and in Taiwan. This aside, Lee manages to deliver an engrossing and suspenseful film ( even mahjong is exciting) that runs beyond two and half hours. Much of it is due in part to the extraordinary performances of the leads. Mei Tang as Wang Jiazhi evolves from refugee to seductress in a subdued fashion that bleeds inner conflict. Tang conveys her turmoil with a confused secrecy that keeps the tension high and the audience guessing. As Yee, Tony Leung's hang dog, world weary expression says volumes about the predicament of the trapped bureaucrat doing the invaders bidding. He has repressed all feeling to survive. Only in his rage do we see his humanity. Leung manages to achieve a large degree of sympathy (like Brando in Tango and Borgarde in Porter)for a man who is not only cruel and sadistic but a traitor to his country as well. Jiazhi and Yee are naturally a product of their environment and time and Lee brings this across without graphically depicting the genocidal intent of the Japanese Imperial Army pillaging and raping all before it. The hardships imposed are mostly revealed around Mrs.Yee's brightly lit mahjong table where apolitical bourgeois wives complain about inconveniences due to the occupation. In one economical scene that takes place in a Geisha House he sums up the state of Japan by portraying a Japanese Colonel wielding drunken power as the Geisha, symbolic of tradition, attempts to defuse and hide her embarrassment of what has happened to her culture. The photography is striking and lighting and set design along with a moody music score compliment Lee's deliberate and methodical directing style. There are some slow moments and the highly charged sex scenes threaten their own impact by lingering but overall Lust, Caution is a powerful and absorbing character study of two people swept up in turbulent times beyond their control.","Lust, Caution"
19,kluseba,"Discover two intriguing complementary sides of friendship, ideals, resistance, romance and sex",8,19 November 2012,"This Chinese movie is a visually stunning drama that convinces with two extremely talented main actors that incarnate two credible and fascinating characters. On one side, you have the charming, naive and shy student Wong Chia Chi who gets coincidentally involved into the resistance movement against Japanese occupation and the Chinese puppet government in Hong Kong back in 1938. She gets introduced to the social circle of Mister Yee's wife in order to approach, then seduce and ultimately trap him. The special agent and recruiter of the puppet government is brutal towards his enemies, emotionally cold and very experienced.Wong Chia Chi becomes Misses Mai and is able to seduce her target but when the resistance movement is ready to get the enemy killed, he moves to Shanghai with his family. The group's plans get discovered and result in a twisted crime after which the organization falls apart and disappears. Four years later, Wong Chia Chi also moves to Shanghai for studies and lives a solitary live in depression and poverty, abandoned by her father and her friends. She meets one of her old partners again who introduces her to an egoistic, pitiless and vengeful undercover agent of the Kuomintang who wants to finish what had begun four years ago. Wong Chia Chi takes the identity of Misses Mai again and soon meets her target on a regular basis. They start to have a relationship that is quite brutal, cold and physical in the beginning but the two solitary souls soon start to develop true emotions towards each other. As the resistance starts to concretely organize the assassination of the target, the matured young woman has to decide which path to choose.The story of this movie is intriguing thanks to a very strong acting and a progressive character development. The film features brutal and cold sex scenes close to a rape but these scenes ultimately get more and more aesthetic and passionate. This radical contrast perfectly portrays both characters and the essence of the movie. In many movies, sex scenes are not very well acted and remain superficial but these ones really make sense, incarnate a certain spirit and feel extremely real as if the two actors were truly in a relationship which is though not the case.The movie is quite slow paced in the beginning and takes some time to kick off which might be difficult for some people but at the same time, this flick gives us a credible portrait of the difficult life during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As it's often the case for contemporary Chinese movies, a lot of budget went into the beautiful costumes, the authentic decorations and the detailed locations. All these elements drown the viewer into a very credible past world and develop a great atmosphere.In the end, any fan of contemporary Chinese movies should check this solid production out. Be sure to view the almost flawless uncensored version that is much more authentic, complex and dynamic than the shortened one.","Lust, Caution"
20,andrewchristianjr,EXPLICIT S*X.,8,12 June 2021,"Good effort at historical setting, fine story, but the acting of the two main characters is more than good, exceptional.

21,3xHCCH,Well-Embellished but Simple Plot,8,3 November 2007,"Ang Lee has become one of those directors for which every film becomes an anticipated event. This particular one is catching a lot of attention because of several graphic scenes of a sexual nature, but it really is not fair to just judge the movie by those scenes. These scenes were shown locally without cuts (unlike Singapore and China). I believe they were integral to the plot, as the characters relationship deepens, and their original motives distorted, with every intense act.Like ""Brokeback Mountain"", ""Lust, Caution"" is also based on a short story, this time by Eileen Chang. But Ang's exposition and interpretation extended this material into a 2 hour and 35 minute movie. I did not feel the length of the movie. It was very well paced and very interesting all throughout. Again, films with situations based to real history interest me. The contrast of the lives of the rich and poor at that time were very well portrayed. The rich talk about jewels and gossip over the mahjongg table, as outside, the poor need to line up to get their rice rations and die on the streets.As with other Ang Lee films, the cinematography was again the main star -- very rich and vibrant. The camera angles were very unique. The production design of old Shanghai and Hongkong, complete with the period costumes, were very painstakingly depicted.Both lead stars were very daring in the depiction of their roles. Tony Leung is really very good in this one. His intensity as an actor penetrates the screen. As the female lead, Tang Wei is very impressive, considering that this is her first movie. Those quiet scenes in the cafe (purposely chosen by Mr. Yee because it had bad food, thus less people who could see and bother them), and the geisha house (where Mr. Yee lets down his guard and likens his own situation with whoring) are the best in the whole movie.Despite all this embellishment, the main conflict and story are actually very simple, even disappointing in its resolution. This is my main complaint about this movie. I had wished for a less typical denouement, but that was not to be. I felt that the ending was so much similar to other movies that dealt with the same plot. I would have wanted to see Wong see her mission through, despite the huge 6 carat diamond ring dazzling before her eyes at that fateful moment. I thought she would be much stronger in her resolve than that, especially seeing how much she had already gone through in her life to get to that moment.","Lust, Caution"
22,EUyeshima,"A Stunning, Evocative Production Compromised by Opaque Characters and Plodding Pacing",6,8 March 2008,"This review is specifically for the NC-17 version of this film.Lush and lugubrious are the two adjectives that come to mind after just watching Ang Lee's 2007 follow-up to ""Brokeback Mountain"". On the surface, the two movies appear to have nothing in common, but they share two attributes - both share the concept of a forbidden relationship, and both are expansions of acclaimed short stories. This time, the literary source is Shanghai-born writer Eileen Chang's 1979 novella set in China during the Japanese occupation. As adapted by Wang Hui Ling and James Schamus, the focus here is less on character development and more on a ponderous, drawn-out conspiracy where acts of passion threaten to upend an ambitious mission to kill a powerful official working with the Japanese puppet government. The net trade-off is a film that is sumptuous to look at and impressive in its meticulous attention to historical detail, but sometimes challenging to track and ultimately not as emotionally involving as it could be. Interestingly, the film earned the notorious NC-17 rating for the graphic sex scenes in the last hour, but Lee obviously includes them to amplify the desperate extremities of the principal characters. Running at an epic length of 157 minutes and with particularly fast-turning English subtitles at the beginning, it can often feel wearisome, especially in the methodical way the plot unfolds. At the same time, no film by Lee can be completely dismissed, and there are rewards to be reaped from his idiosyncratic approach.Through an extended flashback, the story spotlights a group of Chinese students who perform patriotic plays to raise Chinese spirits during the occupation. Inspired by the zeal of leading player Kuang Yu Min, several members of the troupe band together to plot the murder of Mr. Yee, a member of the Japanese collaborationist Kuomintang government of Wang Jingwei. Among them is a shy young girl named Wong Chia-Chih, whose family has fled China and in turn, finds herself at home on the stage. Her innate talent and quietly coquettish beauty are such that she is designated as the lure for Mr. Yee under the guise of Mrs. Mak, the wife of a businessman who is away in Hong Kong. The seduction seems to be working, but a first assassination attempt in Hong Kong fails. By chance, a second attempt is made years later in Shanghai, and the consequences become overwhelming for all involved, especially for Wong who becomes entangled in an erotically charged, emotionally confused affair with Yee. Much of the film's second half is focused on the evolving nature of their adulterous relationship, and at the same time, the motivations behind these characters are left open to interpretation. As the film progresses, it becomes increasingly difficult to empathize with their fates because the plot remains stubbornly opaque. Moreover, more discipline could have been applied to the editing as some scenes remain painfully lengthy, such as the fumbling, brutalizing killing of a government insider.Even with the flaws, the performances are uniformly strong. Tony Leung Chiu-Wai, Wong Kar-Wai's favorite leading man, plays Yee close to the vest as we see little of how he behaves in his official role. However, the actor conveys Yee's simmering menace with subtlety until he translates his explosive contempt in the bedroom. In a most auspicious film debut, Tang Wei looks very much like the porcelain-doll models in the vintage Chinese advertising of the 1930's, and she turns in impressive work given the challenging arc the character experiences. There is a palpable uncertainty in her portrayal of a seductress that serves the film's ambiguity well, and as the glamorously composed Mrs. Mak, she looks stunning in Lai Pan's period clothing. Smaller roles feel more contained within the storyline. Regardless, Asian-American pop sensation Lee-Hom Wang plays Kuang Yu Min with spirit, and the versatile Joan Chen makes Mrs. Yee a sharp background figure, especially when she rattles on during the meticulously lensed games of mah jong. All the sensory aspects of the production are impressive - Alexandre Desplat's lustrous music, Lai Pan's period-authentic production design, and especially the rich cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto (who performed the same duties on ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Babel""). Make sure to look for the 2008 DVD with the NC-17 version, which includes ten minutes of footage not allowed by the MPAA to run during the original theatrical run. Not just for prurient tastes, the scenes add a necessary layer of complexity to the relationship between Wong and Yee. Beyond that, the one significant extra to the DVD is a sixteen-minute making-of featurette that provides just a cursory look at the production including comments from the Lee, Schamus and the principal actors (Wei is barely recognizable as the same person in modern dress).","Lust, Caution"

24,aharmas,The fine line between manipulation and self control,9,23 November 2007,"Mr. Lee has already proved that he can put together a delicate piece of film-making, even when he takes on some very controversial subject matter. He does because he works with the elements in the souls of his characters. In this film, he takes on two very flawed beings, one learning to navigate the fineline between using and being used, and how that one becomes blurred when emotions overtake our logic. The other is a man who is apparently unable to connect to others, after all, he is a cold manipulator in charge of getting rid of any undesirable obstacles in his regime.We see the female character evolve and become a sophisticated spy who might probably be able to bring down this monster. She believes in the cause, is trapped in a mire of emotions, but somehow learns to find her way through this mess, and eventually seduces her prey, or did she? In the background we got a society that is falling apart at the seams, and Lee adroitly shows us a world that can no longer exist, as long as the different factions continue attacking each other. It is all a matter of time.A regular woman, grows up, learns to use her charms, discovers the power of sexuality, when she uses it snare her prey, and she learns that it is not so easy to fight it when others are using it to control her. This conflict is the heart of the movie, and it is beautifully shown to us by the expert hand of Lee, a man who understands his story, the motivation of his characters, and how life really is.Gorgeously photographed, beautifully acted and directed, and another success has been achieved by Ang Lee.","Lust, Caution"
25,dierregi,An overlong character study,5,21 February 2008,"The plot of this movie can be described in a few words: plain-faced, simple girl gets involved with unsuitable married man ... and, by the way, there is also a very unlikely assassination plot thrown in for good measure.The movie starts with a claustrophobic opening, followed by a jump backward to four years earlier at the starting time of the assassination plot (depicted in all its inanity), followed by a jump forward when the inane plot is revived, in the attempt of bringing it to completion.During all this time the Wei Tang character (AKA plain-faced girl) is consumed by lust for the Tony Leung character (AKA married man) and apparently, so is he, despite (or because of) all the practical problems of her everyday life (lack of food, lack of clothes, lack of security). By the time they finally embark in their sick relationship, one wish the movie would rush to its end, because more than hour has gone by at snail pace. In the meantime the assassination attempt is forever postponed by a character - who is supposed to be a mastermind of the spying world - under ludicrous pretests apparently invented just to give the two lovers some more chances to indulge in their sadomasochistic relationship. A lot has been written about the sex scenes between the two main characters, but to be honest they take no more than 5% of the whole screen time, and are not gratuitous but quite complementary to the story. I found more vulgar and offensive sex scenes in movies such as ""Showgirls"", but this is another story. The problem with this movie is that it is just a study of two rather twisted personalities who happen to live in a troubled place during troubled times. It is a character study, and as such quite overlong.The spying angle is ludicrous. I have never seen secret agents (or would be agents) so pathetically dumb and unprofessional. Even among amateurs, it should be pretty clear that the Wei Tang character cannot be trusted, since she so openly infatuated with the target of the assassination plot. She is also quite unconvincing at playing ""femme fatale"". Her infatuation gives her away and she does not have the sophistication and shrewdness required to play the woman of the world she is supposed to be. The other members of her would-be-secret-agents-group are not any better, yet none dares getting out of a game obviously too big for them. It is as if none of them is aware of torture, mutilation and death penalty (as every good spy should). The end is also quite ludicrous, and it does not arrive any time too soon. Suffice to say that everything is for sale, and a six-carat diamond is an argument good enough for a traitor. By then one has time enough to grow unsympathetic towards all the characters. More than scandalous this movie is slightly silly and overlong.","Lust, Caution"
26,bkrauser-81-311064,Vivid but Stuffy,6,30 June 2016,"On its face, Lust, Caution should be a heavy film composed of worthwhile themes. Set in China during and in the aftermath of Japanese WWII occupation, the film certainly has a lot to work with. Add to that an espionage tinged love angle, a competent director in Ang Lee and a two and a half hour run time, surely Lust, Caution is given a wide enough birth to become the finest of Far East imports. Sadly, despite some strong performances and adornment, the film ultimately feels shallow and inert.The film begins with the enigmatic Mrs. Mai (Tang) calling resistance fighters just before an assassination attempt on Chinese collaborator Mr. Yee (Chiu-Wai). We then flash back to 1938 Hong Kong where the buxom Mai is but a humble, virginal student named Jiazhi who has passion for theater. Due to the Japanese invasion, Jiazhi connects herself with the shambling local resistance fighters and begins to spy on Mr. Yee. The plan; gather information and kill the man by impersonating the wife of a Hong-Kong based trading company. What begins as a simple mission turns more complicated when a love triangle forms between Mr. Yee, Jiazhi and Kuang (Leehom) a fellow student and adamant true believer in Chinese resilience.Despite a few widely framed soldiers, the Japanese are conspicuously absent from the film. The only presumed enemy is Mr. Yee and to a much lesser extent his absent-minded wife (Chen). Jiazhi as Mrs. Mai sits with Mrs. Yee in elongated games of Mahjongg, picking up tiny pieces of gossip while the man of the house shuttles back and forth between work and home. Mai's attempts to woe her mark builds a low humming tension giving the film much needed atmosphere. It's the type of atmosphere one would expect from many of the Hollywood films Jiazhi goes to see in the movie theater though it's closest influence would arguably be Hitchcock's Notorious (1946).Difference is, the plot eventually got going in Notorious. In Lust, Caution, the stakes of Jiazhi's gambit don't really hit home until halfway through the film. The midriff of the movie reaches a crescendo in a moment of shocking violence followed by nothing that really brings new insights or complications. It's like watching an elaborate juggling act only the performer is doing one impressive feat for thirty minutes. Sure, it's exciting at first but after a while you're thinking, ""Is that it?""When the romance is finally consummated (albeit in a sexually violent way), years have passed. The resistance evolved from a group of students into an interconnected web of lies and self- preservation. Yet through it all Mrs. Mai and Mr. Yee drift and reconnect with all the urgency of a tortoise documentary on pause. Their listless dance of seduction and deceit is punctuated by drawn- out moments of un-stimulated sex whose decadence calls attention to itself and distracts from the story. No doubt, Lee's reverence to the physical form is artistically full of merit and the warm palettes of the room where the characters play out their tryst could infuse effortlessly in a better film; but here it feels mechanical. Neither does the sex (which garnered the film its NC-17 rating) compliment the films themes of foreboding and tragedy. The story becomes downright Sophoclean yet the visuals are vivacious and stuffy.Lust, Caution went on to sweep up all the major awards at the Venice Film Festival and was hailed during it's time as sensual, vibrant, beautiful looking espionage drama. Well not to put my head in the Golden Lion's mouth, but I take exception to the film being called sensual; pretty: maybe, but sensual: no. Sensuality implies carnal gratification of the senses. There's nothing really gratifying about ten minutes of sex scenes involving two disengaged characters trying to stem the looming specter of death and anguish. If anything Lust, Caution is a sad movie, or at least should have been if it wasn't fighting itself.","Lust, Caution"
27,stensson,Another Lee disguise,7,23 March 2008,"He's amazing. He's a new kind of director for every new film. That doesn't mean Ang Lee is at his best here.This is Shanghai in 1942, during the Japanese occupation. A small resistance cell has been formed by a theatric group. A girl has the hardest mission. She is supposed to seduce a traitor here. But after a while it's unclear who really is the seduced one.Somehow it's rather conventional telling. Except for the explicit sex scenes, this could be a Hitchcock drama from the era. But the whole thing becomes a little pretentious, even if you understand where it will end. An entertaining black story, but somewhat passé anyway.","Lust, Caution"
28,Philby-3,Love and war are not nice bedfellows,9,21 January 2008,"Ang Lee is one of the more versatile directors on the planet, He has done Jane Austen (Sense and Sensibility), Rob Moody (The Ice Storm) and Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain), not to mention the Incredible Hulk (Marvel Comics), but here he has gone back to his roots and produced a very Chinese movie - beautiful, tragic and long (from a 28 page short story by Eileen Chang). It is a pity that mainland Chinese audiences will be deprived of the sex scenes (""caution: lust!"") which are central to the story but there is still plenty of drama left. It is often forgotten that even China had its quislings who collaborated with the invading Japanese, and that there was a resistance which fought a ruthless war against invaders and collaborator. We see things from the Chinese viewpoint  this is nothing if not a patriotic movie.This is the story of one young member of the resistance, Wong Chia Chi (Wei Tang), a member of an acting troupe, who after a great deal of effort over several years to get into the confidence of a notorious collaborator, Yee (Tony Leung), so that he may be assassinated, finds herself falling in love with him. The guy is a ruthless killer and has a rather wooden demeanour and it is difficult to discern much charm  until of course they make it to bed. Then it kind of makes sense.The Shanghai and Hong Kong of 70 years ago are beautifully evoked, though much of the action takes place in rather gloomy interiors (it does seem to rain a lot in Shanghai). To a non-Chinese the acting is terrific particularly as Wei Tang as Wong Chia Chi and Tony Leung as Yee. Joan Chen as Yee's wife is interesting as a featherbrain instead of her usual dragon lady persona.I'm conscious of having missed a lot of the movie's subtext, but I certainly felt the power of its images. Even without the sub-titles it would tell a story. It has done well in SE Asia, but not in the US. I don't think you have to be an art movie buff to enjoy it  love stories have, after all, universal appeal.","Lust, Caution"
29,MadamWarden,ANG LEE AT HIS BEST,10,3 January 2021,"This is an epic examination of the soul, love and loyalty. Tony Leung and Tang Wei are sensational in this long, but absorbing, ""love"" story. Beautifully shot as one would expect by the master, Ang Lee.The sets, costumes and score all contribute to this skillfully crafted piece of art.A must watch!","Lust, Caution"
30,jaredmobarak,"I have a missionLust, Caution",8,30 October 2007,"I can't think of a more prevalent example of misguided trailers then Ang Lee's new piece Lust, Caution. I was anticipating a tale of romance and seduction between an older man and his mistress within Japanese occupied China. Wow, was that not even close. True those aspects are there, but the real story is so much more involved, stimulating, and unexpected.After following his last Chinese language film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with two English language works, it is nice to see Lee go back to his native tongue. I enjoyed both Hulk and Brokeback Mountain for what they were, but neither touched his martial arts epic in terms of scope or success. When hearing about Lust, Caution, I was very much excited to see what he would do with it. Looking more like a Wong Kar Wai movie, (not sure I have the credibility to make that statement seeing as I've only seen the gorgeous In the Mood For Love), I was hoping to get a sense of the character pieces he had done early in his career that I have not yet been able to view.If there is one thing that stays consistent through the works I have seen, it is his wonderful use of cinematography. With cameraman Rodrigo Prieto, (a man who has filmed works by favorites of mine Iñárritu and Cuarón), behind the lens, one could not expect less. After working with Lee on Brokeback Mountain, he once again shoots some stunning work. The framing is always perfect, many scenes use mirrors and glass to keep all the action on screen simultaneously, and the sexual encounters are displayed with the right amount of care and brutality necessary to get the point across on what is happening. This is one sticking point that has been gaining a lot of press around the movie. Does it deserve the NC-17 rating here in the US? Maybe. Nothing is more graphic than say HBO's new series ""Tell Me You Love Me,"" yet it is more integral to the story. Many of the instances are pretty much rape, and that is something one should know going into it, in case it will deter your wanting to view the movie. However, the overall impact of what happens would not be even close to what it is had those moments been excised or edited. The sex between our two leads is the bond that connects them beyond the jobs they are doing. That physicality is what makes the final third of the film as heartbreaking as it is.As I said before, though, Lust, Caution is not about the love affair been characters played by the great Tony Leung and startling newcomer Wei Tang. What we really have set before us is a tale of revolution, espionage, and maturing within the confines of a world at war. Tang is just a kid who finds herself the new star actress at her school. The theatre troupe she works with decides that they should do what they can for the resistance, which they are unable to fight in. After its director, played nicely by Lee-Hom Wang, has a chance encounter with an old friend, the troupe gets to the cusp of a dangerous situation. They soon find themselves way over their heads, trying to orchestrate an assassination of a Chinese man working with the Japanese as a traitor to his country. When the event that shows the culmination of their age and inexperience plays out, it is both unexpected and unavoidable. Either way, though, they have embedded themselves into the guerilla war and eventually find that they had no chance to turn back. Meeting four years previous to the film's conclusion at the back of their college theatre sealed their futures.While at its core we are given a story very similar to last year's foreign sensation of espionage, The Lives of Others, it is shown very differently. Lee allows the story breathing room to ferment and go its course. Each ""spy"" grows up so much during the four year span of the film. Between the main two, Tang and Wang, along with Leung's traitorous, political general, the evolution of each is shown in its entirety. All three's motivations are clearly laid out and during the almost three hour runtime, the audience cannot become lost because they are shown absolutely everything. So, rather than build extreme tension between two people, like in the German film, Lee allows for a slow construction of backstory and relationship with all involved. All our principals grow together or apart based on what they allow themselves to do for the ""good of their nation."" No matter how good the story itself, the film would be nothing without its magnificent acting. It is Tang and Leung that carry the movie. With so many moments of silent expression between them and some tough to stomach scenes in bed, these two amaze. The emotions are always prevalent and the decisions they make never stray from character. Yes, their relationship is unconventional, but the bond they forge cannot be taken lightly. While the middle portion might seem a bit long and monotonous to a point, the finale is a feat of genius. From Tang and Wang's final look into each other's eyes and Leung's reaction to the clock's strike of ten, all you can think is how Lee let this story be told as it should. So, I guess while I chided the industry for their almost suicidal handling of foreign films, I do need to give them some credit for still letting us Americans, who don't mind reading subtitles, view them in their unedited glory. (Well at least some times, if this was a no name director and not Lee, I wouldn't have been surprised if the producers changed the ending and shaved an hour off.)","Lust, Caution"
31,tim-764-291856,"The Potential to be a Classic...,",7,5 August 2012,"Having been a sincere fan of Taiwanese super-director Ang Lee since his superb 'The Ice Storm', I have seen him bravely move from one contentious subject, to another, usually with incredible aplomb.After sweeping the boards with awards for his English language and rightly popular 'Brokeback Mountain', he definitely doesn't rest on his laurels and did not re-make some other short story to the same successful recipe.Only a very brave or suicidal director would come up with a two-and-a- half hour, slow moving war-time epic set in Shanghai, as the follow-up. Listed under both Erotic and Period as well as drama and foreign language, these are not the genres that anyone wanting to make a quick buck would sanely go for. However, whilst stately and often beautiful, it is not one that I sit too happily with and I've just watched my DVD of it for the second time.The story is fairly complex and the first hour is spent setting up the remaining 90 mins. The leads, though are spell-bindingly hypnotic, especially in the often poetic and fluid direction. The music, too, for me, plays a big part, eking out and complimenting the emotions and feeling of the scenes.The erotic tag is justified, though if anyone thinks that it's wall-to- wall sex scenes WILL be disappointed - and wait an awfully long time for when they do. Despite their relative candidness, they are strangely beautiful and Lee has coaxed out that rare thing - intimacy with feeling - in the throws of passion it is possible to see just what each partner is getting from the sex, just from the expression in their eyes: quality stuff. Unfortunately, the sexual violence that precedes all this is difficult to watch and is one of the main reasons why I cannot wholly enjoy, or recommend this film. A pity.Is this a mis-judgement on Ang Lee's part? Possibly not and many do think it a great film of high merit. Having said that, we all have our no-go areas and at the end of the day, no amount of brilliance can wholly redeem a film, or indeed, anything which crosses those boundaries.","Lust, Caution"
32,khanbaliq2,Academy Award-winning director Ang Lee adapts this Eileen Chang story set in World War II-era Shanghai.,7,11 December 2009,"Lust, Caution is another resounding success for director Ang Lee, whose film-making has such mass and substance. The story is mostly set in Hong Kong in 1938 and in Shanghai in 1942, when it was occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army and ruled by the puppet government led by Wang Jingwei. It depicts a group of Chinese university students from the Lingnan University who plot to assassinate a high-ranking special agent and recruiter of the puppet government using an attractive young woman to lure him into a trap.Lee's long, stately, gorgeous film, somewhere between a tragic romance and an espionage thriller, is a thing of beauty: a story of wartime insurrection, into which emotion of astonishing intensity intrudes. The erotic scenes between Yee and Wong are memorable, even transcendent: as a would-be actress, playing a part as her enemy's mistress simply overwhelms her. Leung is splendid as the unknowable Yee, while Tang Wei looks like the biggest discovery from this part of the world since Zhang Ziyi, or even Gong Li. The involuntary betrayal at the film's end perfectly resolves a story of great complexity and passion. With this film Ange Lee won for the second time the Golden Lion Award at the Venice Film Festival.","Lust, Caution"
33,rzajac,"I watch this flick about once a year and cry, like clockwork, at the ending",10,28 January 2018,"I've grown sort of conservative in my old age. I used to be an avant gardist. I rejoiced in chaos and meaninglessness: I believe in narrative, now.That's why I rate this flick so high. It's a good example of a film that *perfectly* fulfills the purpose of narrative. A story is told, the detail is pitch-perfect, time flows like the ""jiang""; the great concourse; and the drama is very direct, pointed right straight at the primal twin issues of love and power, refusing to look away from predictable and unpredictable outcomes.This is a perfect story. And you get the impression that Lee Ang knew *exactly* how high he had to rise to meet this extraordinary occasion, and he did so rise.I do want to touch on the key point of the movie--since it seems so many commenters here missed out on that. No spoiler here: In fact, the following may help you if you're about the watch the flick.Se, Jie has one thing in common with Inglourious Basterds, strange to say. But they do squarely share a theme: Can it really happen?: Could (should?) artists get sick and tired of winning all the moral battles, and decide to reach out and win a *real* battle; a real-world battle for truth and justice?And... yes: This gets directly tied to the deep, unspeakable tragedy at the end of Se, Jie.(And, bear in mind, this isn't the *only* theme; Se, Jie has a number of themes, at least as important as this one.)It's a great movie; one of those that you need to watch *carefully* before you die.","Lust, Caution"
34,Danusha_Goska,Two Small Gimmicks Where Its Mind and Heart Should Be,4,22 March 2011,"""Lust Caution"" is a big, fat melodrama with two small, lifeless gimmicks where its heart and mind should be. It's the story of a young, beautiful Chinese spy who, implausibly, must seduce a Japanese collaborator in order to set him up for assassination. The question that is meant to keep you watching through endless, empty, boring, setup: Will the would-be assassin fall in love with her quarry, a man she is forced to bed? ""Lust Caution"" has the production values of a superior melodrama: stitch-perfect vintage costumery: Chinese qi pao, Japanese geisha, and Western power suits and boxy shoulders; big, fat, vintage automobiles, shiny with chrome; and recreated cities of Japanese-occupied 1940s China. This film will satisfy viewers whose only demand of a movie be that it be luscious to look at.The problem is the ersatz gift underneath all those ribbons and inside all that crepe wrapping paper. The movie has no heart, and it has no head. The first hour and a half are unbearably boring and empty. I watched the mahjong scenes a couple of times to make sure I wasn't missing anything. They establish the superficiality of the Chinese collaborators' wives. That could have been accomplished much more quickly. The point of the scenes: look at this Chinese woman's perfect manicure, look at this big, fat ring, look at this silk qi pao. There's nothing there to engage anything other than the eyes.The film's two gimmicks: will the would-be assassin fall in love with her quarry, an utterly despicable man who, the film makes clear, tortures and murders Chinese freedom fighters during his long days at work, ""at the office."" The second gimmick: graphic sex scenes. In online reviews, some of the film's viewers assume that the act is not simulated, but genuine.Japan, of course, committed wartime atrocities every bit as horrific as those committed by the Nazis. They just committed their crimes farther away from Western news cameras. I won't detail here the nightmares the Japanese created in cities like Nanking; Iris Chang, among others, uncovered these hidden atrocities.""Lust Caution"" has chosen a monster for its lead. In bed, though, this torturer is one of the world's great lovers. His masterful feats of lovemaking are so acrobatic you'll not be sure if you're viewing a page from the Kama Sutra or a metaphor invoking ramen noodles.I'd really like to sit director Ang Lee down and ask him a question. Why did you cast actor Tony Leung, handsome, tender, and charismatic, as a torturer? Do you really think real life torturers looked anything like Tony Leung? Leung cannot hide the facial expressions of a human, decent, lovable guy. He is not the best choice to depict a man hardened by years of the kind of tortures that the Japanese performed. Yes, being a professional torturer shows on the face. Look at the faces of professional torturers. They don't look like tender lovers. They don't look like Tony Leung.All of this nonsense could have at least been entertaining, but it's not. ""Lust Caution"" has a single-digit IQ, no soul, and a glacial pace. In addition to be grotesque, it commits the cardinal sin of a popular entertainment. It is almost too boring to sit through.","Lust, Caution"
35,Blue-Grotto,"Multi-layered, Passionate and Wonderful!",10,12 August 2017,"Love is true only if it lasts through hard times. For Chia-chi, an intelligent and beautiful loner in China of the late 1930s, such a test takes many forms. She experiences a crush for a fellow student, Yumin, who encourages her to join a group of actors and renegades speaking out against the Japanese invaders of the mainland. Acting comes naturally for Chia-chi. So naturally and honestly in fact that reality and imagination become intermingled and a blur in her mind. When Yumin shifts the focus of the group from acting to an assassination plot, Chia-chi joins in, if only to be closer to her crush. Their target is a fearsomely effective and high-ranking agent and Japanese collaborator, Mr. Yee. Chia-chi is chosen to befriend Yee and lure him from his safe zone where he can be shot. Chia-chi is so immersed in different roles and emotions that she does not know who or what to trust. Yee, in his openness and honesty, tugs at Chia-chi's heart despite his brutality. She wavers between passion and fear, lust and caution. ""If you pay attention,"" says a character in the film ""nothing is trivial."" The same is true of the film; there are so many wonderful layers. This multi-dimensional world of impossible, hopeless and doomed love, is where director Ang Lee – one of my favorites - is at his best. Little things such as holding hands, fleeting glances, little marks of favoritism or love, carry immense significance. Emotions are raw and heartfelt. They hit you like an electric current. Eyes are piercing, cicadas hum in the background, the actors are beautiful and conversations are fascinating. There is the art and gossip of mahjong, the mysterious melodies of shou-shu, the lavish fashions of 1930s Shanghai and the music-box-like sweetness of Brahms. Scenes transition well from one to the other, and surprises - such as a sudden stabbing – often thrill and delight. Lee portrays inner emotions and conflicts so very well, in part through eliciting fantastic performances from the actors. The way Lee combines bliss and doom in one moment, as he does in a scene where someone is close to committing suicide and at the same time the happiest they've ever been, is pure mastery. You'll recognize the moment when you see it. The ending of the film is one scene, once glance, that will forever stay etched in my memory.Ten years ago, I waited in the ""rush"" line of last minute ticket hopefuls to see one of the premiere showings of this film at the Toronto International Film Festival. The line dwindled to just two people in front of me when the administrators announced they had only one ticket left. I was crushed. I was so close to getting admitted and had waited so long, yet I had failed. Each of the two in front of me, however, refused to go in without the other, so that last ticket was mine! This was the beginning of my love affair with the Toronto International Film Festival. I attended the festival every year since this moment.The film is rated NC-17 for its sex scenes which are wrongly judged to be too long and explicit by some. The scenes are, rather, fit antidote to the neutered, bland and fake sex scenes that are typically shown in films. The emotion and spark of Lust, Caution is what makes Lee such an amazing director. Some maintain that Lust, Caution is not one of Lee's best films, yet I crave his doomed love stories and believe this film is in the same league as Brokeback Mountain and - my favorite film of all time - Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Some say the film is too long at two hours and forty minutes, yet I cannot see where the film might be cut and still maintain its wonderful power. The language of the film is mostly Mandarin. It is set in Hong Kong and Japanese occupied Shanghai circa 1938 – 1942. Seen at TIFF, 2007.","Lust, Caution"

37,moviesleuth2,Pure Ang Lee from start to finish...,6,20 May 2008,"Ang Lee is now one of the most celebrated directors out there, and rightly so. His films are breathtakingly beautiful, and they unfold like a lavish, vivid brushstroke. ""Lust, Caution"" (or more appropriately, ""Se, jie"") is Ang Lee through and through, though it is not his best picture.The film begins with a brief, mysterious clip, then it starts three years prior to the first scene. The protagonist is Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei), and she befriends a group of students putting on a patriotic play. Soon after, the group of students decide to take their patriotism to the next level by eliminating a man working for the Japanese, known only as Mr. Yee (Tony Leung). Wong is selected to seduce Mr. Yee so he can be assassinated. Complications, of course, arise.The key to creating a mystery is to leave a part of the story or a character ambiguous so that the audience wonders what the truth is. The best mysteries find the right balance between not being ambiguous enough (and making the answers to the mysteries obvious and predictable), and being too ambiguous (which will leave the viewer confused and sometimes slightly irritated). Most big budget movies play on the safe side and the resulting pictures are often less intelligent than the people who view them. ""Lust, Caution"" is different. It doesn't find the right mark, instead, it errs on the other side of the spectrum. There's a lot going on in ""Lust, Caution,"" but so much is left unclear that some elements of the film are hard to follow.Strangely, the story in and of itself is not what's unclear. It's the interaction between the two principal characters (though, in a movie like this, that's what's most important). Specifically, it's Wong's motivations that are unclear. We don't understand what she's feeling; her emotions are kind of eclectic. While one could argue that this is probably Ang Lee's intent, I beg to differ. Wong is the anchor of the film. It is through her that we see the story, so her motivations should be clearer. Maybe this would have been easier if there was some chemistry between the two leads (which there is none).While there isn't any chemistry between Leung and Wei, that doesn't mean that their performances are bad. The two stars give terrific performances. Leung's Yee is an emotionless being. When he talks, he says the words, but the tone of his voice conveys the same emotion. It's his face that shows what he feels (which I will get to later). Tang Wei is great in her first role, and it's clear that she has a lot of potential. She fully inhabits her character, and we see her as Wong Chia Chi, not an actress playing Wong Chia Chi. What's most impressive is her comfort in front of the camera. No matter how good the performance is, it's usually clear when an actor's first appearance on the screen is. It's hard to explain, but for me, it's usually clear. Tang Wei is different. She's a complete natural, as if she's been doing this for decades.There are two topics that are frequently discussed in regards to ""Lust, Caution."" The first is that it's too slow moving. While it is true that the film unfolds at a slow pace, it never drags, and it's never boring. In fact, such a pace is perfect for this kind of a film. This is neither ""The Silence of the Lambs"" nor is it ""Saving Private Ryan."" Actually, it more closely resembles film-noir than any genre that the former examples belong to.The second is, of course, the NC-17 rating. Given the MPAA's notorious strictness on sex, it's not surprising that most people wonder if the film really deserves it, or probably more likely, how much sex is there. The answer, actually, is not so clear. The sex is pretty hard-core, and judging from the MPAA's record, it's not surprising that they slapped the ""kiss of death"" rating on the film. However, this is not pornography. It's tasteful, but it's not in the usual style, if you get my drift. Still, it's graphic enough that it's eye-opening, though that may be from the heavy restrictions that the MPAA has forced upon many films. So, from the MPAA's standards, yes, it deserves it. From a more open-minded person, it's on the edge. One of the sex scenes delves into S&M, and it is unclear whether it is rape or not (though judging from what happens in the film after that, it is probably not rape). The other scenes are more frank about sex than anything else that has graced the silver screen.Still, it's a beautifully made film, however imperfect it is.","Lust, Caution"
38,Mr_Sensitive,I Don't Think This Is A Masterpiece.,7,3 December 2007,"Well I must admit first thing first that I watch the R rated version because they don’t show the NC-17 here, and therefore this review will be rated on R rated version.Synopsis: Wang Jiazhi, a small girl from Shanghai got swept in the political game as she and her fellow students from the drama class tried to lure the secret from the Chinese traitor Mr. Yee and assassinate him.This movie is isn’t for everyone. I myself didn’t quite see the masterpiece like most people claim to be seen. To the very point that do these people actually like the film that much or just pretend to like the film to raise their standard of film watching? I thought this was a very good thriller but no where close to being masterpiece. For me there is not quite anything to hold on or to remember the movie by, maybe also I didn’t watch that controversial sex scenes that people talk about.Ang Lee is what caught my attention the most and the main reason why I go to see this movie. The story is pretty OK, very well scripted. As expected brilliant direction and very well cinematography. Also very well cast, even a newbie like Wei Tan has also gave a very memorable performance. I also thought the music also goes with the movie very well.Last words: At the end I still don’t see what is so brilliant about this film because there isn’t quite any scene that even caught my attention.Recommendation: Yes, Should at least watch it once or twice.Reason to Watch: Ang Lee Film, Brilliant Casts and Sex Scene.Reason Not To: Personal dislike of this genre of movie.Rating: 7/10 (Grade: B).Please Rate Y/N After Read.","Lust, Caution"
39,TaylorYee94,"Colorful, both the movie and the story",8,1 May 2021,"Just as Wong Chia Chi has to walk a tightrope between revolutionists and collaborators, Tang Wei masters her acting by staying right in the middle of revenge and affection. She is just phenomenal in this movie, conveying all sorts of emotion ranging from strength & confidence to humiliation. When she acts a spy, her face, posture, and energy are those of spy; when she becomes Mr. Yee's lover, her eyes tell she is falling in love with him. Meanwhile she does not forget to illustrate confusion, guilt, and indignity by staying in the middle.The plot development of 'Lust, Caution' is the work of art. The screenwriters manage to keep suspense alive throughout the whole movie and regulate burst and release with the right timing. For example, while the movie lasts more than 150 minutes, it does not feel long because the tragic killing of Mr. Tsao (burst) in the middle of the movie informs the audience the end of the first part, naïve and idealistic college student, and the start of the second part, more complicated emotional whirlpool. In contrast, what revolutionists suspect of grand scheme of Wang government turns out to be the romantic gesture of Mr. Yee (release), and this scene actually highlights his trust and attachment to Mrs. Mai. They were successful not only in narrating knotty story of Wang and Mr. Yee with perfect tempo and control but also describing social environment of China and the world in 1940s as a backdrop.The color and the aesthetics of the film. I credit Ang Lee for this achievement. Vivid colors, vintage aesthetics, buildings and costumes that combine tradition and modernization which can imply what China was all about in 1940s. All these efforts make 'Lust, Caution' more sophisticated and beautiful.","Lust, Caution"
40,gsygsy,a fine film by a true master,8,17 January 2008,"Another intense, involving work from this outstanding director. In particular, the central performances from Tony Leung Chiu Wai and Wei Tang are astonishing; and the costume designs by Lai Pan are superb. As in his previous film, Brokeback Mountain, observed intimacy is Ang Lee's trump card. He and his actors are fearless - there's a post-coital close-up of Tony Leung which is so startling in its power that I'll never forget it.Two aspects of the movie prevent it, I think, from being quite the same level of masterwork as its predecessor. The first is the the historical background: the wartime atmosphere seemed to me to be presented in a somewhat token way. And this is related to the second weakness that I perceived: the exteriors were often unconvincing, not least the effects-based historical view of Hong Kong harbour - these days, surely we expect something better than we get here. Compare and contrast the detail of the interiors, in which it seems to me the director is far more interested. This was not the case at all in Brokeback - in fact, in that film, one of the most powerfully intimate scenes was an exterior: I'm thinking of the awesome farewell scene between the protagonists.Such cavils aside, this is, nevertheless, a fine film by a true master.","Lust, Caution"
41,rowmorg,Another secret-agent in bed wtih the enemy movie,6,19 January 2010,"A rather long drama with several cutting-edge flashbacks and flash-forwards, this powerfully made picture demonstrates the Mata Hari role beautifully. Newcomer Wei Tang handles the difficult role of the sexy secret-agent, and Tony Leung/Chu Wai plays the horny bad guy. They indulge in a couple of fairly explicit sex scenes that explain plenty about where the bad guy is coming from, and what our heroine is up to. The entire film is told in a deceptively tea-timish fashion, with only one serious outbreak of violence, about at the end of the first reel. Lust Curtain reminded me of a couple of other pictures about Mata Hari girls in World War Two, one in Holland, the other in Denmark. This picture matched either of them.","Lust, Caution"
42,Seamus2829,Blackbook Chow Mai Fun,7,9 March 2008,"Okay, let's face it. Although this film is very lavishly photographed, and the set design is a treat for the eyes, 'Lust,Caution' (better known in Asia as 'Se,jie')is little more than a rehash (of sorts)of Paul Verhoeven's 'Black book' from last year (which in itself was a lift of the German film 'The White Rose',from several years ago). With all respects to Ang Lee,who bedazzled me with 'Brokeback Mountain','Eat,Drink,Man,Woman',and several other winning films of years past,has let me down a wee bit. The (obvious)plot concerns a group of student stage actors,staging patriotic plays,while plotting to assassinate a known political figure who sides with the Japanese, between 1938 until 1942. The group plans on using sex as bait to attract,then strike when he is not expecting it. 'Se,jie' as gotten some flack about the graphic,explicit sex scenes (which may or may not have been faked)during the seduction scenes. Although these scenes were somewhat important to the plot, somehow manages to pad out the film beyond it's two & a half hour,plus time block. Word is that Ang Lee had to cut a half hour for China (which has far more astringent censorship laws then Hong Kong). I'm guessing the cut version would have been a bit tighter than the current one. Still, it's not a total loss.","Lust, Caution"
43,freakfire-1,"Ang Lee is no Jet Li, but he gets the job done.",9,11 March 2008,"This certainly had a darker ending than what I was expecting. There are some nationalistic Chinese, whom with some influence, say its not historic. Further objections are raised by this group because of occupation. There wasn't enough evil occupiers killing Chinese. Well, so what? In the film, there is a line that makes it clear. While the Japanese had no problem slaughtering those that opposed them, however they were also human and scared as hell. Just because it didn't show lots of bad things by the Japanese, doesn't mean the film is a-historical.The characters are well done. The sex scenes certainly weren't as graphic as I thought they might be. I have seen longer and more obscene sex in R and even PG-13 films than this. However, the sex seems to have been forced and more along the lines of rape.The plot was very involving. The main character was trapped in a seduction that crossed so many lines for her that she breaks down near the end and bares the emotional scares before her comrades - describing the rape-like encounters. It isn't pretty to hear, but it shows how committed she is.Overall, I believe this is a well done film. It is historical in many ways. Just because it doesn't show all the fighting doesn't mean its not historical. Most of the people involved in World War 2 never saw the battlefield. ""A""","Lust, Caution"
44,come2whereimfrom,Perfect film-making.,9,25 January 2008,"With the exception of the Hulk Ang Lee makes beautiful films and Lust, Caution is no exception. A stylish romantic thriller set in Shanghai during world war 2 it tell the rather sad tale of the relationship between student/activist Wong Chia Chi and the powerful political figure of Mr.Yee. At nearly three hours it never once feels that way as Lee weaves the story of espionage through the shanghai streets and graphic sexual encounters. The cinematography is brilliant and where previous films like 'Brokeback Mountain' was full of sweeping open spaces this is the opposite with most of the action taking place in rooms and offices. As you would expect there is a fitting score and Wong Kar Wai favourite Tony Wai head up the impeccable cast and along with co-star Wei Tang gives a career best performance as the staunch politician. Lee has once again proved that he a master at his craft and has cemented his reputation amongst the great directors of our time. A fantastic example of film-making at its best and a must see for film fans anywhere.","Lust, Caution"
45,PipAndSqueak,"Caution, NO!",2,6 February 2008,"Sorry folks this is not a top notch film. I find so much at fault I don't want to start. Ang Lee has produced just one decent film (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) and I suspect the impetuous for that came from elsewhere. I find pouting actresses (this one has several) so off putting - I refuse to go to anything with Laura Dern in it, or nowadays anything with Keira Knightly for precisely this reason. I think this will likely be the last time I bother with an Ang Lee production. I was not moved or convinced by this story - even if it is based on a real story. If you like reading Mills and Boon romances fair enough - this is the cinematic equivalent. Not to my taste at all.","Lust, Caution"
46,thenolanfan,"Review - Se, jie",6,18 October 2020,"I was surprised by the violence and the directing in sex scenes in this film as his NC-17 rating suggests, it is not for anyone, but it is not a masterpiece either. There are about 4 NC-17 scenes in that film, these are the most entertaining, meaningful, raw, beautiful (in a certain sense) scenes of the film the rest is boring dialogue and romantic scenes empty of emotions. It is sad because, with Ang Lee at the helm, this film had potential.","Lust, Caution"
47,marymorrissey,not always plausible but very intense,9,7 January 2009,"I was never bored by this movie. But I couldn't grasp why the one guy who knew what the young people were up to was the only one who figured it out, while coincidentally the Yees leave town and refuse to meet whatsername even for lunch. Towards the very end when Yee asks why he was not informed of the conspiracy and his lackey responds ""cause of your involvement with the girl"" that seemed even more difficult to swallow. But for the political theatre scenes, the gruesome assassination scene, the many and various ""love"" scenes. and for the ending alone this film was well worth watching, 'not the usual fluff' to quote James Chance, and a really good story if flawed in terms of plausibility.","Lust, Caution"
48,jemps918,"magnetic, vulnerable, vicious",8,29 October 2007,"Director Ang Lee is a late bloomer in the controversy department. Apparently reinforced by the acclaim he won from his gay cowboy flick Brokeback Mountain, his latest offering is an espionage thriller, Lust, Caution.Set in WWII-era Shanghai, Lust, Caution opens in the middle of the story of Tang Wei (played by Wang Jiazhi), a young woman who is getting emotionally attached to Mr. Yee (played by Tony Leung), a powerful political figure whom she is set to destroy as an undercover agent for the Resistance.With hardly any dialogue and speaking mostly with his eyes, Tony Leung Chiu Wai (Hero, Infernal Affairs) is ever the veteran. 'Asia's Clark Gable' is at once magnetic, vulnerable and vicious. Newcomer Wang Jiazhi is versatile and uncannily delivers; her chemistry with Leung is authentic and her burgeoning tension and frustration with their group's leader Kuang Yu Min (played by singer Lee-Hom Wang) is heartfelt.It is refreshing to see a Chinese film without the colorful Chinese costumes and the (now) desensitizing martial arts sequences and see instead a raw, noir drama. The costumes and sets were very well done. Each frame was beautifully shot, the attention to every painstaking detail is apparent, and the casting of the intense acting leads was terrific. A lot of the attention and marketing has been given to the carefully coordinated sex scenes but that is not what haunts you long after you've seen the film. Despite its historical background, it's how the film successfully communicates to the audience because of the basest human instincts that lurk inside and ultimately unites us all.","Lust, Caution"
49,kyrat,Pointless & insulting to women,2,11 January 2009,"MAJOR SPOILERS: Group decides to target evil traitor. Innocent girl forced to seduce him. He violently rapes her (which we are forced to watch). He's shown to be a sadisitic control freak, treats her like a whore, she tells how he f*cks her until she bleeds and uses rough sex to dominate her.She does not want to continue in her act - wants the assassination done with. You see her SUFFERING through the (ANYTHING BUT erotic!) sex by staring at a gun she could use to kill him. Then suddenly evil bad guy buys her a GIANT SHINY DIAMOND.... and apparently that overcomes all patriotism, pride or self-esteem... so she tells him to run away. (we we supposed to believe she loved him???? Or was it really because it was a HUGE DIAMOND? Or did he finally just break her?) Evil bad guy escapes being killed and then rounds up all the conspirators in the group and they all die (including her). The end. So what exactly was the point of those 2.5 hours? We watched this poor woman whose family didn't want her & whose friends only used her - have sex and play mahojng and that's pretty much it. It gets 1 star for portraying old Shanghai which I enjoy seeing (my grandparents lived there) and 1 Tony Leung but otherwise it was a HORRIBLE disappointment. I have watched every Ang Lee movie and enjoyed all of them to varying degrees (the Civil War one wasn't so good). I expected much better from a great director, great actors and even the movie had great potential! So I am especially angry to have sat through that pointless waste of my time and supposedly 4 years of this woman's life.","Lust, Caution"
50,seawalker,"Dark, menacing, withdrawn and grey",8,14 January 2008,"It's January. About time for another WWII drama about a plucky, female resistance fighter going undercover and getting too involved with her 'target'.Actually that sounds pretty sarcastic. I do not mean it to be. Just about a year ago I saw Paul Verehoeven's movie ""Zwartboek"". It was a great film and made my top 10 for the year. The similar themed ""Se, Jie"" is also a great film.""Se, Jie"" covers the same emotional ground as ""Zwartboek"", only from a Chinese/Japanese rather than a Dutch/German perspective. Also, the execution of the material could not have been more different. Whereas ""Zwartboek"" was informed by the chutzpah of it's director (big, colourful, loud, energetic and brightly lit), ""Se, Jie"" is dark, menacing, withdrawn and grey. And it is a bleak movie. Oh, so bleak. No winners in this film, no matter what way you look at it.As for the controversial sex scenes, yes there is sex in this movie, but probably not as much as you might think. The sex scenes are uncomfortable, grave, intense and sometimes disturbing. Very brave and uncompromising performances from Tony Leung and Wei Teng. If you are expecting titillation, forget it. Go and see something else.I thought that ""Se, Jie"" was an excellent piece of work.","Lust, Caution"
51,screenwriter-14,"Cinematic, Elegant, Entertaining and Real 2 The Period",10,6 October 2007,"With a sensational cast of actors and a tale of China in the late 1930's under occupation, LUST, CAUTION captures the cruelty of the period with a zest and cinematic journey which enraptures the audience in a tale of revenge-and love. Bravo, Ang Lee, for bringing to the screen such a lustrous tale of Chinese history in which you have also thrown in love scenes which bring to the film an element of cruelty and harshness which are reminiscent of the sexual pleasures of BASIC INSTINCT, but perfectly display the brutal character of Mr. Yee.The costumes, sets, lighting and the drama of the story make LUST, CAUTION a simply elegant journey with characters that jump off the screen with fury, passion and of course, love tinged with revenge. The film is long, but you can't take your eyes away from the film for one moment as you might miss the brilliant dialog and performances. LUST, CAUTION, makes you think of what it is to be occupied by a power that treats its captured denizens in a world of anger and bitterness and creates a world of hatred and revenge as we see in this intelligent and important film. May LUST, CAUTION continue to gain an audience as it heads into the Kudo season.","Lust, Caution"
52,arthera09,fantastic film,9,3 January 2010,"I really loved this movie and I like how it does not end with a cliché Hollywood ending. The movie was held together by outstanding performances by the two leads. Both of them show real skill as actors and it took what would have been an OK film and made it a fantastic experience. So I will first address why I did not give it a 10. I felt as if the beginning was a little slow and the side characters were just throw-aways. I slowness of the beginning was forgiven because it added to the suspense of the last 20 minutes of the movie. I really was not sure how it was going to end and up to the last shot I was semi-expecting some schmaltzy ending. I have to say one of my favorite scenes was the play and the monologue she gave at the end. It really established the character and the passion. I guess one cannot write a review of this movie without mention the explicit nature of the sex. I am not sure why this was such a big deal and some of the best moments came during those scenes. The first scene showed us another side of Yee's character that we had not seen yet, but could only suspect. We also saw Wong's moments of weakness. The whole of the movie would not have been as good without those scenes. I think the highlights of the movie for me was the set design and just the general look of the film. The set design was outstanding the outdoor sets were ""wow"". I can see how Tony Leung will go down in history as one of the biggest movies stars of all time after looking at his filmography and seeing his talent. The whole cast was great, but like I said some of those side characters just fell flat and did not interest me at all.","Lust, Caution"
53,Ozzy2000,Brilliant Masterpiece,10,17 May 2008,This is a brilliant film directed by Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain). The protagonist of the film is the very attractive Wong Chia Chi (Wei Tang) because of awkward circumstances up a resistances involved in dangerous espionage. The film begins with Wong Chia Chi joining a University theatre group involved in highly nationalistic repertoire during the nationalistic uprising in 1938 China. This was momentous time in China with the rise of the Mao's communist forces and the Nationalistic forces of China further complicated by the imminent Japanese invasion and World War 2. Wong Chai Chi also known as Mai Tai Tai begins to develop a relationship with a leading member of the group Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang) but flees the group to Shanghai after she witnesses the group actually murder a Traitor to the nationalistic movement after she was goaded into luring him into a house. Furthermore she had to sexually seduce this victim after mechanically losing her virginity to one of the members of the group for training. This emotionally confronting experiences is devastating for Tai as she actually is very fond of Kuang this combined with the brutal amateur murder by the group were the major factors in her desertion of the theatre now turned resistance group.The Japanese invade Shanghai and Tai's father flees to London and Tai is forced to fend for herself under cruel murderous Japanese occupation and their Puppet Chinese government. Three years after her separation from Kuang they are reunited in Shangai. Kuang easily recruits Tai in the organised resistance probably more due to her unrequited feelings for Kuang. Her Mission is to seduce Yee head of the Chinese Police of the puppet regime. Tai succeeds in seducing Yee and endures his cruel and violent sexuality for such a long period that she begins to develop feelings for the him and vice-verse. The explicit sexual scenes highlight the sacrifice that Tai makes and the cultural perspectives and are justified. A masterpiece!!,"Lust, Caution"
54,Benjamin_Cox,A wonderful reminder of the talents of Ang Lee - 91%,9,20 November 2008,"It must have been tempting for Ang Lee to give up Hollywood altogether before he made this glorious film. ""Hulk"" was a bit of a disaster, winning neither fans nor critics while his Oscar-winning ""Brokeback Mountain"" quickly gained notoriety as the gay cowboy movie. But Lee specialises in telling wonderful stories in beautiful frames - one only needs to recall ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to understand what I'm saying - and here, he delivers a powerful and tragic love story set against a brilliantly realised vision of 1940's Shanghai.Debutant Wei Tang plays Wong Chia Chi, a young woman attending school in 1938 where she meets handsome political idealist Kuang Yu Min (Lee-Hom Wang). Stirred by his desire to fight for the resistance against the Japanese, Wong finds herself and her friends plotting to assassinate the enigmatic Mr Yee (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). After the plan fails, four years pass before they get the chance to finally complete their mission. But as she gets closer to Mr Yee, her feelings for him threaten not only their mission but their lives as well.Having watching the similarly themed ""Black Book"" the other week, I was surprised at how little action there is compared to Paul Verhoeven's WW2 film. ""Lust, Caution"" is a very slow movie, taking its time in getting going but at no point do you feel bored not distracted and this is largely down to the exceptional performances from the leads. Tony Leung Chiu Wai breathes life into a disturbingly complicated character, both gentle and horrifyingly brutal in equal measures. Wei Tang, in her first movie, has had the debut of a lifetime and matches her more experienced co-stars every inch of the way. But this is ultimately Ang Lee's film and despite the pace, you still enjoy this wonderfully epic tale of this doomed romance. If anything, the explicitness of the controversial love scenes surprises more than they shock but they don't distract from the overall picture in the same way that they did in ""Monsters Ball"". The only real criticism I have is a bit more back story would have been nice but I can't really hold that against a movie. It's unfair to mark a movie down because of my ignorance of the setting.""Lust, Caution"" (or if you prefer, ""Se, Jie"") is a brilliant movie, full of tension and passion and a perfect reminder of a director's real strengths. Ang Lee is a true cinematic icon and one of the best directors out there at the moment and this is easily his best effort since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". There's none of the visual gimmicks of that oft-copied martial arts epic but this is no less epic for it, filled with all the ingredients required to make a simple story become a great movie. It looks the business, is wonderfully performed, has a soundtrack which perfectly captures the mood of every scene and never becomes complicated or boring at any point. This is a sublime movie and all it needs is for you to give it a chance.","Lust, Caution"
55,nturner,Another Unconventional Love Story,10,7 November 2008,"Ang Lee certainly has a talent for directing unconventional love stories. First there was Brokeback Mountain and now we are gifted with his very next film, Lust, Caution.The story takes place in China over a three year period, ending in 1942. At the beginning, the scene is in Japanese occupied Shanghai where we find Mrs. Mak playing mahjongg with three other socialite wives. These women seem to be far removed from the chaos of war and occupation that surrounds them. Mrs. Mak, a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Yee, leaves the game to go on an errand which is perceived by the viewer as something covert. During her errand, Mrs. Mak stops at a restaurant and makes an enigmatic phone call.The scene shifts to Hong Kong three years earlier where we see Mrs. Mak as student, Wong Chia Chi. Wong and her girlfriend meet Kuang Yu Min who invites them to join his theater group. Kuang is a politically oriented young man who has written a nationalistic play dealing with the freedom of China for the grasp of outside influences. Wong, who joined the group somewhat as a lark, has flowered into the lead female character. There is definitely an attraction between Wong and Kuang, but he is such an intense young man devoted to his causes that he does nothing to foster the development of their romantic relationship.Instead, Wong finds that the main agenda of the group is deadly - mainly the assassination of Mr. Yee who is a collaborator with the Japanese. During a break in classes, the group rents a house in a wealthy area of the city and begins a deception - actually a play in real life - in order to meet the hated Mr. Lee. Wong and another of the student actors pose as Mr. and Mrs. Mak in order to enter the social sphere of the Lee's and to, eventually, murder Mr. Lee.However, murdering Mr. Lee is not that easy as he is not only heavily guarded but also an enigmatic, psychologically closed man. But, being a powerful man of powerful desires, he cannot resist the wiles of the enchantingly beautiful Wong.Events occur that prevent the group from carrying out their plan. These events are so repugnant that Wong separates herself from the group.The scene shifts to three years later in Shanghai where Kuang and his compatriots seek out Wong in order to resurrect the plan. By this time, conditions under the Japanese occupation have become so unbearable that Wong agrees.A good part of the rest of the film concerns the relationship that develops between Mr. Lee and Wong posing as Mrs. Mak. This relationship leads to some of the most beautifully, erotic sex scenes I have ever seen in a film. They are brutally frank and extraordinary. A caution: this film is rated NC-17, and it earns it.The excellent extras on the DVD give the Western audience insight to the three actors who play the major parts. Mr. Lee is played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai who is known for much lighter roles in China. He is superior as the extremely dark Mr. Lee who is a brutal, yet very human, man.The two young people who play Wong and Kuang are first-time actors but you certainly wouldn't know it from their performances. Wei Tang as the beautiful Wong is hypnotic. You can't keep your eyes off of her. Kuang is played by Lee-Hom Wang who is actually a rock star in China. He is perfect as a young man filled with ideals and emotions.One of the reviews of this film that I read said that no one under thirty could possibly understand the complex emotional tie that develops between Mr. Lee and Wong. That may be very true for there are few traditional - especially in younger Western eyes - bonds that so cement the two in a passion destined for destruction.As far as I'm concerned, Lust, Caution is a must-see film.","Lust, Caution"
56,janyeap,A Cautious Tale about Blind Love,10,31 August 2007,"Excellent! Excellent! This film really injects the visual meaning of 'caution' throughout the film - at least till close to the finale. There are numerous instances when I was reminded of the film's appropriate title, ""Lust, CAUTION""! Indeed, a remarkable visual achievement that cooks up metaphors to provide so much food for thought.Two characters, who are supposed to understand the nature of their duties and responsibilities, gradually becoming suckers to their self passions and sentiments not unrealistic for the many who may recall the 1963 Profuma Affair that brought down the Harold MacMillan government in Britain, or even the Mark Anthony and Cleopatra tales! In this film, the supporting actors play very minor roles in the film. This actually impresses me more to make me consider that a person's downfall oft results from his/her weakness, especially in relation to his/her uncontrollable passion and sexual urge. Love is blind... as the saying goes.The film's flashbacks are well crafted to introduce Mr. Yee and Jiazi and to focus on their persistent, strong and certainly up-to-no good, determined characteristics before they succumb to their sentimental temptations and passions. The scenes of stylistic elegance of the Colonial Hong Kong being clouded by Japanese Occupation, and scenes of Shanghai with its bleak post-Qing Dynasty signs of chaos, together with the expected Second Sino-Japanese War terror, flow through the film at a good pace. The urban crowded characteristics of these cities, with their tenement-blocked living, marked with social and political upheavals and turmoil, and class exploitation are artfully exhibited - the allure and historical trauma of both cities so subtly revealed without over-shadowing the performances of Tony Leung and Tang Wei! It was certainly captivating to watch how this film celebrates Hong Kong's urban identity while also mediating its historical relationship with Shanghai. Just like with Mr. Yee and Jiazi, perils and pleasures of modern urban life are inescapable for the two cities.Director Ang has also amusingly mixed Chinese sensibilities and Hollywood influences to give Shanghai that dangerously cool, and seductively sexy appeal that does help to raise question of the stake this city faces with the presence of Mr. Yee and Jiazi. After all, didn't Shanghai become a locus center of vice and degradation - a foil to the virtues of the countryside? Is the audience, at the beginning of the film, expected to see Mr. Yee and Jiazi as upholders of these opposing modern vs traditional traits, and as far as foreign occupation relates, the differences East vs. West colonialism? For fans of Zhang Ailing who authored the original story upon which this film is based, It's not difficult to relate some of the tragic incidences of the film to Zhang's very tragpersonal life. This film should especially appeal to those familiar with the 1940s history of Hong Kong and Shanghai, and to those who had experienced the inner turmoil, resulting from having to adapt to changing environments.And I do enjoy seeing this film as an attempt to remind the audience how a couple, passionate in romantic love, often puts in their best performances and stylistic acts to impress one another (as portrayed by Mr. Yee and Jiazi). These love 'sparks' have a tendency not to exist with old married couples as seen in Mr. and Mrs. Yee's love relationship.","Lust, Caution"

58,blackburnj-1,Ignore the controversy - this is one of the best films you'll see this year,9,28 May 2008,"""Lust, Caution"" is perhaps one of the most controversial films for many years. NC-17 rated in the States, re-cut in China and noted the world over for its explicit sex scenes, this film has been widely discussed. This is a shame, not because it doesn't deserve this controversy but because it should be remembered for so much else.This is a tense, gripping, atmospheric and effective war thriller. Armed with a pitch-perfect script, exquisite acting and stylish direction, this is one of the finest films you will see this year. Eroticism undoubtedly plays a very important part and, on the whole, it is dealt with very well, but some scenes are excessive. The scenes are so intense that they are, to a certain degree, necessary, but there are too many of them. It is a problem with the film, but it takes very little away from a superb drama.The success of this film is owed to a number of people, chief among them Ang Lee. This is very nearly a triumph for Lee. It is a masterpiece of style and subtle direction. The superb evocation of period and stylish photography give the film a wonderful feel whilst Lee's effective cutting creates tension and atmosphere out of glances and whispers. Even though this film is very long (two-and-a-half hours in total) it is completely gripping and completely satisfying. It is not an easy watch but it is a thoroughly rewarding one.Lee is greatly assisted by his two lead actors and Tang Wei in particular. For such a young actress to deliver a performance of such intelligence and subtlety is, frankly, incredible. Her performance is perfectly anchored by Tony Leung. This is a thoroughly uncharacteristic Leung role. His Yee is quiet, diminutive but with a dark side always simmering under the surface. It is a master class in tour-de-force performing from an old master and a new star.With ""Brokeback Mountain"", Lee's film was able to transcend the controversy. ""Lust, Caution"" has not been as lucky, but this is an example of a master of his medium working at the top of his game. It is a film that really should be seen and a must for all film lovers.","Lust, Caution"

60,samuelding85,"Bravo for Uncut, Be Cautious of the Edited Version!",10,6 October 2007,"Ang Lee has once again thrilled the audience with his latest feature, Lust, Caution. For the effort he puts in for the movie, he not only did the Chinese cinema proud by bringing home a Golden Lion Award in Venice Film Festival, but also shocks the audience and film reviewer with its 9 minutes long explicit sex scenes between the 2 leading character, Mr Yee (Tony Leung) and Wang Chia Chi (Tang Wei).To accommodate the market in China, which do not have a film classification system, Lee comes out with an edited version for everyone in China. Gone were the 9 minutes long sex scene, together with the mood that one should had when watching Lust, Caution. And that was the version released in Singapore a month ago, with much protest from Singaporeans. At last, after waiting for a month, the original uncut version has been brought to Singapore, and this is a good way to repay Singaporeans who have watched the edited version earlier on, and at the same time, to draw audience who boycotted the edited version. As for the story, it is about a group of youths from Hong Kong University who formed themselves a resistance group against the Japanese during World War 2 in China, where they plan to assassinate Mr Yee, a smart traitor who works for the Japanese government. Lead by Kuang Yu Min (Wang Lee Hom), they decided to get Wong Chia Chi to become Mrs Mak, the wife of a rich exporter, where she will get close to Mrs Yee (Joan Chen), so as to get an opportunity to know Mr Yee.The plan fails when Mr and Mrs Yee left Hong Kong in a hurry upon the order of the Japanese government. 3 Years later, Wang mets Kuang and Kuang persuades Wang to continue the plan to assassinate Mr Yee. Once again, Wang gets close to Mr Yee, and she realized she loves him, while he fonds for her.Based on Eileen Chang's short story, Lust, Caution is a Chinese film that is appealing to the Chinese, rather than foreigners. At the same time, it also presents us with the contrast of the lives of the two different worlds: the rich and the poor. Here, we have a moment the rich man's wife's who kills their time playing mahjong and gossiping about politics, sipping bird nest soups, flashing their diamond rings on the mahjong table. Outside the apartment, civilians are queuing for rice purchased at the black market, dead bodies lying around the streets and suspects of Resistances beaten up and arrested by the Japanese soldiers.The main focus of the film is none other than the relationship of Mr Yee and Wang. Tony Leung has delivered a superb performance by reprising the role of Mr Yee, an aggressive and sadistic agent working for the Japanese. Fans of Leung will be surprised for the bold performance delivered to the audience, which for the first time in his movie career, he will be appearing totally naked. Tang Wei, who is a newcomer, has put in life for Wang Chia Chi. From an innocent girl who was disappointed with her father for leaving to England without her to a girl who has to struggle between love and patriotism, she has delivered a good performance. Not to mention her maiden appearance for the bold and daring erotic sex scenes with Tony Leung, which has put her on the world map.As for Wang Lee Hom and Joan Chen, both has become redundant in some way. Wang makes more appearance in the film than Leung, but he did not seems to leave a deep impression compared to Leung. Being an American born Chinese, the Mandarin dialogue Wang spoken has been more comical to the audience than his great performance that he delivers. Joan, on the other hand, seems to be totally unnecessary. However, without her role of Mrs Yee, Wang would not have an opportunity to get close to Mr Yee, which is the main objective of the film: to kill Mr Yee.Unfortunately, the removal of the 3 sex scenes for the edited version has not only ruined the mood of the movie, but also seeing a deeper view of the human nature. How aggressive is Mr Yee? Why did Wang choose not to resist sex with Mr Yee? Is she in love with him? Did she truly loves him? The removal has left the audience with several question marks at the end of the movie. In fact, some audience feels the edited version of Lust is too stressful and depressing to watch.Fortunately, the uncut version has arrived in time for those who felt cheated when watching the edited version earlier on. Here, the questions asked have been given an answer, which is something Lee has given to the readers which has not been given by Chang. It goes with the flow, which has once again thrilled the fans of Lee. To the matured audience, please be mentally prepared that what you see might not be something pleasurable to your eyes (for the graphic sex scene and violence in the film). Ang Lee deserves a full marks for the original version of Lust, Caution while only award 6/10 could be awarded for the edited version even though the flow of the story is not affected. Comparing both versions, most would definitely choose the uncut version, which i do personally felt that it deserves a recognition for the effort they put in. A Word of Caution: The edited version might leaves you disappointed.","Lust, Caution"
61,commandercool88,Brutally sensational.,10,8 July 2008,"An NC-17 rating kept many from seeing one of last year's most impressive pieces of work. Ang Lee's political thriller, 'Lust, Caution'. It takes a rare and brilliant mind to craft a film about a time and place unfamiliar to most American audiences and with ease grab their attention and pull them in from the start. Thank God for artists like Ang Lee. 'Lust, Caution' is a beautiful film, a brooding work of art that is without a doubt worth its near 3-hour running time.World War II claims a remarkable place in history. It was a world of conflict, nations pitted against nations and people pitted against people. 'Lust, Caution' focuses on one of two war fronts, and it's not the one you and I are probably most familiar with. It is the Japanese occupation of China. And when a young acting troupe decide to take matters into their own hands and assassinate a top Japanese strategist. Over the next several years, this group of friends will face a seemingly impossible struggle to infiltrate the enemy's core. A battle that will bring with it death, lust, and betrayal.'Lust, Caution' doesn't hesitate when it comes to telling a deeply psychological tale. It takes no shortcuts, nor should it. It sets out to tell a story, one that requires a methodical hand to guide it along. And tell a story it does. The prospect of a 2 hour and 40 minute foreign war drama may seem daunting to most, and that's not surprising. But don't let that scare you away from this moving epic, it is a suspenseful and sensual picture with a tantalizing good story to boot. Ang Lee has proved before that he knows no language barrier, he speaks in a tongue we can all understand. The language of film. 'Lust, Caution' is no different, it is a bold and suspenseful experience that takes us from the beginnings of a student play to sleeping with the enemy. Quite literally. But if eroticism and taste can co-exist peacefully with one another, 'Lust, Caution' strikes a perfect balance that is truly enticing and poetic.Rich character development is endlessly aided by phenomenal acting performances. In particular, Tony Leung as the target of assassination and Wei Tang as the young girl on the inside getting close to Leung. These are two brilliant performances overlooked during awards season. Subtlety is the key here, quiet beauty that oozes with tension and psychological thrills. Aided by a sharp and intelligent script, the entire cast benefits. Surrounding these actors are an array of landscapes that reflect the beauty and tragedy of the times. And with a brilliant score to fall back on, 'Lust, Caution' comes to life before our eyes in amazing fashion. This is one masterpiece that deserves to be experienced. Like a gourmet meal, it must be taken in and savored slowly and thoroughly, every bite as good as the last.It may take place half a world away during a period many of us won't understand, but there are enough common threads that makes 'Lust, Caution' a universal film rather than a culturally based one. At the heart of the story, this is about a girl living in a country she loves dearly that has been taken over by foreign invaders. Modern application, anyone? We may not understand the Chinese culture, but it won't keep you from discovering why 'Lust, Caution' is one of last year's finest achievements. Ang Lee has left his mark on this tragic and haunting masterpiece, and it's not one to soon be forgotten.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public","Lust, Caution"
62,SimonD1900,Highly recommended!,9,24 October 2021,"Long and slow, but if one is in the mood, it's worth it. Great cinematography, just a beautiful movie, top notch stuff. Acting is excellent as well and every character is well portrayed. Intresting and intriguing story that feels real. Sex is a part of the story and the sex scenes are graphic but it's far from everything what the film is about. It's about a group of young and passionate nationalists during an occupation in times of war. This film is beautiful and well made.","Lust, Caution"
63,native_girl333,Ang Lee has don it once again!,9,5 August 2008,"""Lust, Caution"" is yet a one brilliant piece of movie from the recognized director Ang Lee.An activist, patriotic theater-group wants to assassinate Mr.Yee (Tony Leung) who has a warm relationship with Japan. A beautiful Wong (Tang Wei) is send to seduce Yee for murder plans to succeed. Wong is a great actress but where can be the line be drawn between masquerading and true feelings. Wong is strong and is willing to help the activists at any costs.The performances of Leung and Wei are powerful and passionate. Ang Lee has proved to be a magical one-to-one director. Even though the movie was criticized to be violent and highly sexual the erotic part is made realistic and rough with a good reason. ""Lust, Caution"" does not ride with nudity or what some might call pornography. It shows a different sides of using power and who possess it. Women are usually treated badly and men control them but in ""Lust, Caution"" women can be very dangerous and on the top.""Lust, Caution"" is seductive, politic and fantastically directed!","Lust, Caution"
64,kneiss1,"Emotions, suspense – a truly moving masterpiece",10,24 August 2010,"Most of the movies I have seen recently have been more entertaining than moving. Not this one. This movie simply was incredible about its expressiveness. By seeing into the faces of the actors, you have been living through a myriad of feelings. It's rare a movie is achieving this for me. The reasons are several: Great story, great directing, great music, great atmosphere, great acting. Everything came together and created a movie on a rare level of perfection.****Spoileralert****Throughout the whole movie was an ulterior tension. You have always been scared that either the main actress gets caught, or the main actor is killed. It kept me interested through all 157 minutes.So why does this movie only have 7.6 points on IMDb? It deserves much more. There might be several reasons. Hong Kong movies are rated less high than Hollywood movies in general. And this movie here, doesn't have much in common with Hollywood movies at all. Especially the ending is something that can rarely be found in Hollywood movies. Also, the almost 3 hours might have been too much for many people. Another reason are probably the raw and controversial sexual scenes. I have to say though, they fit perfectly into this movie. They reflect the emotional world the two main actors live in perfectly. I really hate to see women ""raped"" in movies (she wasn't exactly raped), but it really seemed to ""belong"" to this movie.****Spoileralert ending****This movie deserves over 8 points on IMDb. I give this movie 10 points because it's is perfect in my eyes. It's probably going to be one one of my all time favorites.","Lust, Caution"
65,wickedmikehampton,A masterpiece,8,16 December 2020,"'Lust, Caution' is excellent! I'd seen it long ago but appreciated it more now, with a mature mind and experience in watching foreign language movies.It made Director Ang Lee world famous.Sadly, actress Tang Wei, with her exquisite gaze (the best) and obvious talent, was essentially banned in China as reaction to to her on-screen nudity. I'm glad that she finally returned to the big screen and hope that she gets another shot like this, her biggest.","Lust, Caution"
66,the_Poppuns,More incredible film-making from Ang Lee,10,6 October 2007,"What a movie. I saw this movie yesterday and I'm still thinking about it. Tony Leung is just awesome. I had seen him in a few movies, I'd already determined that he's a great actor. I have no problem understanding what's going on with him without reading the subtitles because he communicates so much with his eyes. So watching him in this I was curious to see that something else was coming across than you'd normally expect. Here he's playing against type and I thought he did a wonderful job. Definitely Oscar worthy. As is his costar, who I kept trying to rack my brain for a film I'd seen her in but apparently she's a newbie. You'd never know it from her performance. It's a true leading performance since she carries most of the film being in just about every minute of it. She's great. And how great was it to see Josie Packard (Joan Chen) again. :) Ang Lee is a genius. He's so good at capturing the emotions of his characters and actors. It's like he unfolds them so that everything on the inside is laid bare. From The Ice Storm to Brokeback Mountain to Lust, Caution he shows you real people and how they love and damage and betray each other, and more specifically how it feels. That's true talent. Anyone can point a camera. This is something else entirely.The film itself is the best espionage film I've ever seen, but that's not all it is. It's very much like a noir and a war film and romance is probably the genre that is represented least. I've read a few reviews mentioning love and falling in it. There is some of that but I think maybe those people might want to give this one another go. They might have missed the point.Who should see this? Adults. But I'm not saying that because of the sex scenes. I'm 33. I don't know if I would have completely grasped the emotional complexity of this film 10 years ago. I think you need to have been kicked around a bit by life to fully appreciate what's happening here. Anyone who likes old movies, sad movies, good movies. Bogart fans, noir fans, costume design fans should all enjoy it. I sincerely hope it gets some recognition around Oscar time. It's my favorite this year so far.","Lust, Caution"
67,vinsond21,To hell with noble intentions,9,22 December 2007,"During the 1930s, Japan invades China and a group of idealistic students in Shanghai want to do their part for their motherland. This leads them to attempting to assassinate a local leader named Yee who is collaborating with the enemy and sending patriots to their death. The young protagonists, led by Kuang Yu Min (Wang Lee Hom), then get Wang Jia Zhi to infiltrate the Yee household and seduce the man himself. Screen veteran Tony Leung gives a remarkably restrained performance as the ruthless Mr Yee, while exquisite newcomer Tang Wei is touchingly effective as Wang Jia Zhi on whose shoulders so much expectations seem to fall. There is much to love about this film adapted from a short story by Eileen Chang. It may not be a feel-good movie, but director Ang Lee has invested a lot of his heart into its making, taking care that every frame looks and feels right. There are two especially wonderfully evocative moments that worked magic on this viewer. The first comes early in the movie when the students are on a bus, and the second is near the end when Wang Jai Zhi is on a trishaw. As Alexandre Desplat's heartfelt music theme plays over these two scenes, it is however a different mood that is captured and reflected. Such subtleties and nuances in this film are what elevate Lust, Caution from being a work of art to the masterpiece that it truly is.","Lust, Caution"
68,Thepastgazette,"Generally compelling, high quality movie, except for the actors.",7,9 September 2021,"It tends to belittle Westerners when the main Chinese cities were under European administration and very few Chinese had a life in prosperity. Generally compelling, high quality, except for the actors.","Lust, Caution"
69,varundelpiero,Simply genius...,8,11 January 2009,"Ang Lee's follow-up to the highly acclaimed BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a compelling and gripping tale that is hard to tie down to any particular genre. It has elements of an international espionage thriller, a steamy romance, and a softcore porn. On that note, I will comment shortly on the NC-17 rating that cursed this film; a rating that meant it was doomed for mainstream failure at the box-office, and a rating that meant that many film enthusiasts missed out on a truly powerful Motion Picture. The sex scenes in SE, JIE are bordering on the pornographic, and are frequent enough in occurrence (almost 10 minutes, out of the 150-minute run-time) to garner the NC-17 rating, but it is here the argument of pornography vs. art has to be made. I personally felt that the love scenes in SE, JIE served to enhance the movie, as the audience learns more about the two main characters during their intimate physical interactions than any other interaction.This brings me to the acting. At the centre of this film is amazingly and undeniably compelling acting, the likes of which American film-goers are seldom exposed to, which makes it even more shameful that the film was slapped with an NC-17 rating; the proverbial 'kiss of death'. Tang Wei (in her debut performance) and Tony Leung Chu Wai are exceptionally brilliant and the interaction between the characters is tense and emotional. Joan Chen (of THE LAST EMPEROR fame) also has an influential cameo. The story itself is a finely constructed one, merging different genres together without really becoming any single one. The only drawback to the plot development is its intentionally long build-up, which may deter some less patient viewers. Regardless of the fact, it is still worth the wait.SE, JIE remains another powerful film from a director who seems unafraid to experiment and try his skillful hand at different genres. This film deserves an 8/10 and a 3.5 star rating (out of 4). Should just about enter my Top 200 at #200. Unreservedly recommended.","Lust, Caution"
70,janos451,Words of Caution about 'Lust',7,30 September 2007,"Too long, too slow, too self-indulgent, and too brutal in its graphic sex scenes, Ang Lee's ""Lust, Caution"" is a film not to be missed.Whatever misgivings there may be about it, this festival-winning film is a mesmerizing, rich experience. After 2 1/2 hours of being bombarded with a World War II love-and-hate story that's both exciting and dragging, chances are you will be still pinned to your seat, anxious to find out how it ends. The ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" director has turned his attention to war-threatened Hong Kong in 1938 and Japanese-occupied Shanghai in 1942 (complete with a ""safe Japanese zone""), seen through the eyes of a group of young Chinese resistance fighters. Based on the late Chinese-American writer Eileen Chang's short story of the same name, the focus of ""Se, jie"" is the relationship between Mr. Yee, head of the ruthless Japanese-collaborator security forces (played by Tony Leung, leading man of some 80 films) and a young actress with the resistance, played by Wei Tang, in her very first film role. They make a strange pair, both in the roles and as actors. Of the story - a cat-and-mouse game between the seductress/underground agent and the Japanese puppet/lord of life and death among the occupied - the less said the better in order to enjoy the movie. As actors, it's a veteran facing a new challenge and a novice who shows great skill and assurance. Leung has always been a brooding, symphathetic, worn-but-handsome presence, especially in his collaborations with director Wong Kai War. Here, for the first time, he plays not just a heavy, an ugly character, but a scary, unhappy, murderous man, literally a dark figure, lurking in the shadows. It's a great performance, fully realizing both aspects of the character: the monster and the man. Lee's love for the cinema classics is shown both in his use of excerpts from Hollywood greats (as the young actress frequents movie theaters) and in his creation of memorable images. This is a director with a painterly sensibility and the ability to transform objects into instantly memorable pictures. Never will you see mahjong again without recalling ""Lust, Caution."" Few of Lee's favorite classics can match the simple effectiveness of his final image here, of a sheet with slight depressions left by what rested on it shortly before: white on white, and yet meaningful and affecting.Leung and Tang fairly monopolize the screen, but the rest of the large cast is outstanding, led by San Franciscan Joan Chang as Yee's wife, and the vivid individual characters in the resistance, including the American-born Chinese pop star Leehom Wang.","Lust, Caution"
71,hyder_sagg2003,Extremely powerful tale of Passion and Love,10,2 October 2011,"Lust, Caution 2007 indeed is one of the best films of 2007. Director Ang Lee once again delivers a quality movie. Set in WWII-era, the movie is an emotional tale at its best.There are things about the movie which are simply great. Cinematography is so well that it feels like you are going through the actual movie and it has a huge impact on the movie's interest development. The two and a half hour (I do say its long) of the movie is not boring at any time. The direction is powerful and the screenplay is genuine. Performances by the entire cast are also very well. The love making scenes look very original, must have been hard to film but they are not offensive or unnecessary. (Not for kids)Original Score by Alexandre Desplat is very nice to hear. and Rodrigo Prieto once again add a strong cinematography for the film. He not getting nominated for Oscar is a shame.Overall, the movie is very well done and the story told grabs your emotions hard and leave you thinking about LOVE at the end.And when it comes to Accolades, I think the movie is snubbed by most... there were statements that the movie is not from a single country but considering Slumdog Millionaire being from at least 6 different countries and winning the best Picture Oscar, it should have been nominated for few Oscars but I don't really care about that its still a CLASSIC.Its another excellent movie by Ang Lee. 9.5/10 Recommended to everyone.","Lust, Caution"
72,rotildao,Love is more dangerous than war!,9,21 April 2008,"Only directors like Ang Lee and Nagisa Oshima can mediate and express to us the real perilous of love in times of war. Intensity! This movie makes one understand the complexities of love and edginess. Truth is, there are no rules in war, and there are no rules in love! Which one comes first? It doesn't matter! Whenever we're dealing with complete opposites the clashing is inevitable. A clash of powerless pieces of domino conducted by gravity of each of the main characters existentialism give its needed and very well treated intensity in every scene right from the first moment they meet till its conclusion.

The story is interested from beginning to end and even for those who have a hard time watching subtitled movies will find this a good choice. Joan Chen and Tony Leung Chiu Wai star in this and the acting overall is excellent.The movie will hold your interest but the only downside is the NC-17 rating. Director Ang Lee seems to have the same ""more than a passing interest"" in depicting people having sex. This would be the only caution here. The extra details he seems to want to show does not make the movie any better, if anything it takes away from it. He spends far too much time here and needs to find another outlet for his interest other than his movies. Not everyone needs to see detail to this level. At these times its just shy of porno.","Lust, Caution"
74,jjcremin-1,A little slow at first but in a half hour sat riveting,9,12 January 2008,"This is a very different movie than the first blockbuster Ang Lee gave to the public, Hidden Dragon, Crouching Tigar, in that this is spy thriller in which the government wins. And it's all due to 6 karat ring that Wei Tang ultimately can not accept.Tommy Leung has starred in several Chinese films and is very good at under playing. He starred in Infernal Affairs that Scorsese remade as The Departed. A somewhat slight man, yet the most dangerous of all when he doesn't get his needs met.The first sexual encounter between him and Tang is very much a rape. He rips off her dress, slaps her down on the bed, briefly ties her hands with his belt before he enters her from behind. One would think that the girl would eventfully get back to him for doing that to her but that doesn't happen.In fact, in a scene previous, she had the upper hand. When her compadres wait for the couple to appear but she calls it off.The group of conspirators are very well acted, each one being a little different from the rest. The handsome one doesn't make a play for Tang until three years later when the affair with Leung was going full stream.Lost opportunities, I suppose every life has them. I admit I had a hard time following the plot as I'm Chinese impaired but what I could get made a lot of sense. Enough plot twists worthy of classic film noir. This proves that Ang Lee is one of the best creative forces out there right now.","Lust, Caution"
75,evileyereviews,Another Ang Lee Knockout!,8,7 August 2010,"Ang Lee is no mouse when tackling seamy issues, and when he set out to create this sexual thriller, he tossed in the biggest kitchen sink ever. From the sex scenes to the production set, every single thing was done in a cyclopean magnitude. A racy little NC17 number, this one fully exposed the, er, many talents of Asia. The story itself was a simple one, allowing for an authentic time period ambiance. The lead actress, picked from a posse of around ten thousand hopefuls, had never been in a full production movie. Ang Lee spent 3 months training her for the role. It worked, and her lead role was phenomenal. Old hand Tony Leung's talents were used to create perfectly subdued character whose intensity shot out his eyes like elephants on a trampoline. As expected, the direction and camera work were sublime. The movie was rather long at 2 hours and 37 minutes, but not one scene was superfluous or gratuitous. In other words, this epic was worth every minute.Evil Eye Reviews","Lust, Caution"
76,gbx06,Lust is freedom,8,20 June 2008,"Ang Lee returns to his origins without losing the same line that characterizes his film's obsessions. At first I didn't know what do I have to feel regarding this film, although their images marveled me (photography and music were exceptional), the weak stance by moments of story, especially in it's predictable ending and totally anti climate, is what makes me doubt about what I had felt.Now, without fear of being wrong, I can say that the movie is pretty good, actually Ang Lee exploited raise human passion to the maximum and turns it into both sides of the same coin, on one side the sexuality displayed on a raw and accurate across sexual encounters between Mr. Yee and Mrs. Wong, and on the other hand the compassion and love that begins to emerge between the two characters, this exchange of sexual lust for sentimental lust that makes Mrs. Wong betray all her ideals and sacrifice, not only to all who surrounded her, but she too. That is the same lust that leads Mr. Yee to caress empty spaces, to love the memory and live of thoughts, even when he loaded with the betrayal of his beloved.All framed in a historical context changing by the development of imminent war and puts pressure on the two characters, which pushes them to take only those sexual encounters how an escape valve, as the unique support of a gloomy reality that surrounds them and that, at the end of all, becomes a cornerstone of their life.That security of Ang Lee as a connoisseur of the job is what turns a murder, a sexual encounter, a game, a talk, a conspiracy in a piece of art, in a visual delight that for his maturity impacts a such degree that baffled, which makes us doubt our feelings, but that makes us say, after reflection, this is a real love film.","Lust, Caution"

78,john-575,Perhaps a film to admire but not one to like or recommend,5,22 January 2008,"The Australia reviews for Lust Caution were glowing. Brokeback Mountain that haunting story of love I'd rate a 9 or 10. So it was with some anticipation I looked forward to Lust Caution.The locations, cars (perhaps apart from a London taxi in one scene that surely must be post 1942) were just about perfect. The story itself was not bad, but lacking cadence. At 157 minutes the person next to me was looking at her watch and so was I. Sure the Mandarin does not fall to the English ear perhaps as well as foreign European languages but I'm well and truly used to sub titles. With the value of hindsight I don't know what I was thinking. I was curious to see the relationship between Mr Yee and Wong Chia Chi rather than just the sex scenes. Previously in Intimacy (2001) we'd seen Kerry Fox perform fellatio on Mark Rylance as this was in character. In a mainstream film (apart from ""Baise Moi"" which was such good fun) I'm not sure if we need real sex.In Lust Caution the first bedroom scenes were violent and smacked of misogny. Later on the lovemaking. if you like, was more normal, quite athletic and very varied. I just thought there might be a bit more warmth in the bedroom. And perhaps a bit more conversation. That's the way I like. Not sure if the actors really ""did it"", used body doubles...for me that's not important. There was a set of testicles in one shot but for all we know they could have been prosthetic!So in the end sleeping on this it's too long, a little dark which is understandable, needs a good sharp edit. In short it's not the sum of it's parts. Being more a lover of romantic love, the relationship between the key players is not really my cup of tea at all. Give me for example the warmer and more intimate relationship & bedroom scenes between the two jury members in the context of a very interesting history story like in the Chatterly Affair (2006) a BBC Wales production where a married man and a divorced woman over a week of the trial have a week long affair parelelling sections of the DH Lawrence book on trial for obscenity. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0757175/ You'll find trailers for that on YouTube. Compare the trailer for this and Lust Caution. Louise Delamere playing the female lead in this was fabulous.Of course Lust Caution is about war torn Shanghai 1942 and not just relationships. But sadly it's definitely no masterpiece and not a film I could recommend. If Brokeback Mountain was a 10 this is lucky to scrape a 5.","Lust, Caution"
79,dont_b_so_BBC,"""The Ghost Who Serves The Tiger""-- the depravity at the heart of ""Lust Caution""",10,28 January 2008,"Near the conclusion of Eileen Chang's novella ""Lust Caution"", she mentions an old Chinese idiom about ""The Ghost Who Serves The Tiger""-- which is based on an old Chinese legend that a person who gets eaten by an tiger may turn into its servant ""Ghost"" and lure new victims to it. Variations or extensions of the legend even requires hunters to entice or distract these ""Ghosts"" with offerings of food or clothes, so that tigers can be trapped or killed without the protection of their servant ""Ghosts"". And like all ""true myths"", there is no modern or moralizing ""why"" to explain how such a legend arose. The idiom is traditionally used as an admonishment against aiding or abetting evil-- so there is something undeniably depraved at the heart of ""Lust Caution"".This idiom doesn't make it into Ang Lee's movie ""Lust, Caution"" (because the movie doesn't use any kind of off-screen ""narrator's voice"") but all of its implications do-- the Spy is the ""Ghost"" who serves the Collaborator (""Tiger"") and the Collaborator is the ""Ghost"" who serves the Invader (""Tiger""). Ang Lee knew, like all astute readers of Eileen Chang, that the novella was deliberately ignoring war or spy stories conventions by using the Japanese invasion and occupation of China as a historical backdrop for a subtle study into the perverted psychology of these ""Ghosts"". And like Eileen Chang, who was aware of but uninterested in the likes of Ian Fleming and John LeCarre, Ang Lee makes very few compromises to the existing expectations of the ""spy novel/film"" genre:1) The dialog is ONLY in the languages or dialects which the characters would be expected to speak, so most audiences will be reading subtitles at some point (unless they know Japanese, English, Mandarin, Shanghai-ese, Cantonese, etc.).2) Most of the movie is composed of a series of fractured flashbacks, with virtually NO expositional scenes-- so it is up to the audience to research the context (i.e. what was happening in China) and piece together a narrative (i.e. what was happening to the characters).3) Blood, sex and violence is minimal (1 on-screen death, 2 practice gunshots, etc.), and presented in a way which makes audiences squirm in DISGUST rather than squeal in delight-- because they appear to be happening to ""real/ human"" characters instead of sex symbols or action heroes.4) The core mystery of the movie, ""was it 'love'?"" (or ""what kind of 'love' was it?""), remains unexplained or inexplicable and is OPEN to audience interpretations-- because the characters themselves are blinded or confused by their own emotions.5) The film (or specifically Eileen Chang and Ang Lee) walks the fine tightrope of telling a cautionary tale without cheapening or glamorizing its sexual and political elements, and avoids turning into the ""The Ghost Who Serves The Tiger""-- unlike spy or war stories which (knowingly or unknowingly) serve as ""advertisements"" for espionage or war.So this is a ""challenging"" film by most standards, bearing ""rewards"" only if you are able to meet its challenge (of actually looking into the character's eyes and engaging with them). And audience reactions will unavoidably depend on how acceptable they find Eileen Chang's ""feminism"" to be (in letting ""women behave as women""), or how ""mainstream"" they want Ang Lee to be (in making ""art films for the masses""). Hence, the misleading promotional line in western film markets is ""Ang Lee makes (an attempt at) a sexy spy thriller""; whereas the overwhelming conclusion in Chinese-language film markets is ""Ang Lee (successfully) makes an Eileen Chang film"".","Lust, Caution"
80,SLR-3,Yawn - is it over yet?,3,13 October 2007,"This film is marketed as a thriller. Don't fall for it. Long and tedious this is anything but a thriller, and is a good example of why one should not try to make a full length feature based on a short story. The textbooks for university courses under the heading of ""womens' studies"" often claim that all sex is rape. Ang Lee seems out to prove this true. There are a lot of sex scenes. None of them have anything to do with love or tenderness.The main character's motivation for her actions at the end of the story is either obscure or absurd, depending on your viewpoint.Thumbs down from three of the four of us who attended.","Lust, Caution"
81,girlocelot,must have caution before viewing,1,22 March 2008,"Beware the high rating for this film. It's ponderous, boring, & should have an hour edited out. The only good thing I can say about it is the mah jong scenes & the glimpse of a detailed, powerful behind-the-scenes group of women who know how to do things no one else does. I wanted to see a movie about them & their intertwined stories. They were fresh & strong, vivacious & tough.The movie is very long, very slow, with not enough background to clue us in so that length & pace make sense.Acting: the minor characters are great; the leads - what's to like? We don't care about them - they have no passion, the sexy scenes are yucky: basically rape scenes - OK, so she is ""willing"" as it is her ""job,"" but NO woman will watch these & think they are ""love-making"" or anything close; nor are they erotic. If you want close ups of crotches, look at some graphic porn. Those scenes made the entire film tasteless, & distasteful, in the extreme.How about a little creativity here - who knows what the movie is ""really"" about - but do we really need to see another movie about women who are whores, prostitutes, sluts, etc; oh, yeah, it's OK, because they ""choose"" the job. Right.The film's center - I usually would write ""heart"" but it lacks one - is cold, without a strong point of view. I'd rather watch a documentary. I used to like Ang Lee's movies; in future I won't bother watching another one.","Lust, Caution"
82,damfaz,Conflicting reactions,7,11 June 2020,"This movie is set in the China of 40s, during the war. Personally, I don't know too much about war times in China, but I appreciated how this movie provides us just what is necessary for the plot development without going into deep historical details (otherwise it would have been 4 hours long).This movie kept me glued to the screen and I think that this happened because of the strong empathy I established with Wang Jiazhi. All the scenes in which she appears with Mr. Yee create a big tension both because of the risk that she's taking as a spy and the evolution of their relationship.I really enjoyed the movie, but as I expected from Ang Lee, the finale is pretty tragic. I watched Life of Pi and Brokeback Mountain before this movie, and both endings caused conflicting reactions to me. In this particular case, I thought that she would have fallen in love with Mr. Yee and she would have got desperate after his hypothetical death, but I never imagined that she saved him. After that, Yee's cold and quick decision to kill her got me upset. So at first I didn't like the ending, just my personal opinion.Then I realized that, even if she had been a very talented actress for the whole time, she was just an innocent young woman after all. Her beloved Kuang never declared himself in love to her and her life has been empty before this ""job"". On the other side, we find an unscrupulous lonely man, which is somehow fascinating to Wang's eyes. Sex scenes evoke all the pain which they hide and keep safe inside themselves: this fact is highlighted by the gazes of the two actors, the passion, the lust, the violence. An outburst of love like this motivates her choice to save him in the finale, but it is not sufficiently important for a man who has always based his life on cruelty and ""work"".Just to defuse this review, Yee's wife character was funny. She is the personification of ""Who wants to live longer, should mind just his own business"" (that is playing Mahjong in this case).","Lust, Caution"
83,SenorLengua,Delicious,7,15 June 2021,"This is one of those movies which is not well known from a major director (Ang Lee) in part because this was early in their career, and/or it is in a foreign language, and/or it was not widely released in the Western world. (And in this case, it received an NC-17 rating in the US.) This is a shame.How many times have you seen a movie where there are plenty of supporting actors, but none stand out? Yeah, me neither. But this is the case here. The story, if you don't already know, centers around the relationship between Wong Chia Chi/ Mrs. Mak (played by Tang Wei) and Mr. Yee (played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). Everybody else is trivial, at least in terms of acting. Don't get me wrong, Joan Chen (Mrs. Yee) and Leehom Wang (Kuang Yu Min) are very good, but such is the excellence of Wei and Leung that everybody else is more or less feels like a placeholder.But even then, Wei far outshines Leung. It is mentioned often that Tom Hanks acts with his eyes. In this case, Wei takes that idea, and raises it a level. It is so obvious when every time she plays Mahjong that her speaking part is interrupted when she actually speaks. The first trip to the jewelers is also there. And many, many moments in between. But, when she does speak, she is controlled until...just watch the voluntary confession about her relationship with Mr. Yee and how she changes from soft control to...near madness? Or something like that.And the same time, there is the ever increasing tug, sometime literally, between the characters of Mrs. Mak and Mr. Yee. The daring and suddenness, the risk and reward, the safety and threats, are all there in every seen between them. We know Mr. Yee has to have some kind of mean streak, but Mrs. Mak is so soft and pleasant that surely she will bring that part out of him. Or does he know more about her than she thinks?Ultimately, this is a movie about an affair during World War II in China. That the war is going on is in consequential. The real part of the movie, as you know form the trailers, is whether Mrs. Mak can kill Mr. Yee. Because Mrs. Mak is not Mrs. Mak. Or is she?The acting of Tang Wei and Tony Chiu-Wai Leung aside, the movie is luscious with what we see on camera. Time and again, it is wonderful how moments are portrayed. My only problem with this movie is the reason it is rated NC-17. The sex scenes between Wei and Leung, while important, feel like they exploit Wei and could be done in a way that does not need the excessive nudity (to be clear, it is not that I am objecting to the nudity. I am objecting to the way it was filmed). Watching those scenes strongly evoked the recent declaration by Keira Knightly that she won't do a sex scene unless it is directed by a woman.This is one not to miss, but definitely not to watch with kids. In addition to what has been mentioned about the nudity, there is one scene of rape (but that scene is important). It is also a longer film at over 2 hours 30 minutes.My rating is 7+ of 10, rounded down. There are a couple of plot holes, and the supporting actors are mostly unremarkable (Leehom Wang is good, but hit or miss), but if for no other reason, watch it for Tang Wei. Her performance is delicious.","Lust, Caution"
84,nycmec,Accomplished film,8,13 October 2007,"Ang Lee is well-established as a great filmmaker, and I think that many of his films are superb. I think this film has some wonderful elements to it, but there are a couple of problems that I think hold it back from being a 9 or 10.First the good points: the acting is strong from the entire cast, but especially from the leads Wei Tang and Tony Leung. Wei Tang perfectly conveys the conflicted emotions she has towards Mr. Yee (Leung) during the lovemaking scenes. Often love scenes in movies tend towards the rote, but here they are essential to moving the plot forward. Another of Wei Tang's remarkable moments is when she describes her interactions with Yee to the resistance leader--powerful.Ang Lee also captures the naive enthusiasm of the college radicals, and the atmosphere of the time, place and class differences very well. I think the reviews of this film have been mixed because it is such a traditionally told and shot film--it doesn't break new ground filmically, but old forms when well shot have their own pleasures.The film does suffer a bit from the drawn-out beginning section in Hong Kong--I think the first hour and a half could have been made tighter--but after the arrival in Shanghai the movie picks up the pace. Overall, another good film from Lee.","Lust, Caution"
85,sheilakaursheila,"Stunning cinematography, brilliant performsnces",9,9 September 2019,"It's one of the best movie I've seen in years. Each character lived in their own world, often in sharp contrast to the other, even tho they often met at the mahjong table.
Performances by Wei Tang and Tony Leung were gripping.
I can see what theres so much respect for Ang Lee, his directing, alongside the set designers and lighting crew blew this one out of the water.","Lust, Caution"
86,dinaia,Eros and Thanatos,9,19 December 2011,"I viewed this film in terms of contrasts and duality and yin and yang balance.It's a beautiful film, and a beautiful love story between two people separated by so many worldly obstacles and united by otherworldly passion. She was young, he was old(er); she was delicate and suave; he was rough and blunt; she was poor and free, he was wealthy and married; she wore a mask and hid a secret; he offered his true self and never bothered to hide anything about him or his job; she ultimately offered love beyond refute, he offered death. In a game of such contrasts and tensions, can anyone remain sane and able to define who they are? I took the famous erotic scenes as an unrestrained, uncensored, insanely deep and engulfing form of catharsis - a relief from all strains that they felt, unspoken and unconfessed. Even the physical entanglements in the sexual positions were to me highly suggestive of the forceful clash between the yin and the yang of their world, where the drop of black goes into the white half and the drop of white in the black one and boundaries can no longer be established. In their sexual intercourse, we see both hate and love, pain and pleasure, aggressiveness and tenderness, hell and paradise.I feel this is an emotionally draining film. To me it was never boring or slow paced, like some said. Maybe I found it so captivating because it always focused on the main character and Wei Tang worked her magic to perfection. The singing scene in the Japanese house, for instance..I have no idea what she was singing about, but it was breathtaking and heartbreaking.","Lust, Caution"
87,fegorleo-1,overwhelming !,8,20 January 2008,"It certainly lacks a certain rhythm, that I was tempted to compare to Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for... but it still is an undeniably good movie ! I loved the costumes, the settings. Everything seems so accurate, it is always a pleasure with movies depicting the thirties... The actress wears these awesome dresses that I would love to have for myself, and Tony Leung is such a great actor ! I know it's a real pain, but I still have to write 4 lines of this comment for it to be submittable. I could add that the music, composed by a french composer is beautiful. It reminded me a lot of Michael Nyman's and Philipp Glass' for other movies, very voluptuous. But still I think there was something not very 'palpitant' about the movie: a certain slowness, a lack of suspense -I think- that I missed.","Lust, Caution"

89,FantasyCreatureFilmsLLC,One of the greatest films ever made,10,7 July 2015,"Someone pointed out to me that on this date, July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked Nanjing, murdering 300,000 civilians. This was the beginning of the Japanese war on China. I reflected on this and thought back to those hours in a movie theater on Houston Street in NYC where Ang Lee was attending a screening of his new film, Lust/Caution. I remembered the opening scene, a group of women sitting around a table playing mah jongg, and immediately knew I was watching a master work by this director. Not a note of the film was out of place, not the direction, cinematography, editing, performances. Not the devastating conclusion. Though years have passed, the film remains in my memory much the way my first viewing of La Strada or The Seventh Seal do. It is a film anyone who appreciates master work by a great filmmaker should see in their lifetime, uncut. It is a film as well that captures the essence of the atrocities of that war, the sacrifices, the brutalities. It is a heartbreakingly skewed love story and war story that will resonate long after you experience it. I do believe it should enter the recognized canon of greatest films ever made.","Lust, Caution"
90,hudiefanny,Lust...If This Is Love,7,16 November 2007,"Ang Lee is one of my favorite movie directors while Aileen Chuang is one of the most famous Chinese woman writers. However, the movie Lust Caution, a product with their joint efforts, is unfortunately not a master piece at all, not even close.The film scheme and the novel plot seemed to be alike in the main line but quite different in details. I could have appreciated it if it is not adopted from a master piece of Aileen Chuang. I don't know whether Ang Lee misunderstands what Aileen Chuang tried to express via this story or he plays the love card on purpose. Mr. Yee seemed to love JiaZhi back in the film, which totally betrayed the original work and almost makes me sick.I think one can hardly apprehend her point without any background knowledge of the author's own life experiences. In the story, JiaZhi was abandoned by her father. He took his son to UK with him and left JiaZhi after the death of their mother on the concern of the deeply-rooted preference of boys over girls in China. Aileen Chuang herself was once mistreated by her own father and step mother and even mu-red up in a small room for quite a few years. Her mother was a self-centered woman so that she never really took good care of her children especially after the divorce with Aileen's father. Since having escaped from her father, Ailleen Chuang had lived with her auntie without the warmth of a healthy family until she met LanCheng Hu and fell in love. She's so crazy about him and provided him all she had regardless of his political status of a traitor, his marriage with another woman, his incompetence of making a living on his own, and even his frequent love affairs with other women. Even when she was finally fed up with him, she sent him a mount of money with the broke-up letter as she used to afford his living expenses no matter how financially stressed herself.That's why she depicted JiaZhi in the way as she was. She was one of JiaZhi Wongs herself. They were smart, incisive, penetrating to the toughness of life and all the tricks men played on them. The only weak point they were unable to get rid of was that they longed for care and love so much. They endeavored to find little trace of true love and warm care in this extremely cruel and freezing men-dominant world. They paid all their love and passion in return though they knew their male partners were not really the one for them.Therefore, under Miss Aileen Chuang's pen, Mr. Yee would never give JiaZhi the ring in such a romantic way as the movie presents. He bought JiaZhi the diamond just because of the lust satisfaction she offered him, as slight as the payment for prostitution. After giving order to kill JiaZhi, he would not sob as Tony Leung did in the movie. The only emotion in his mind was pride, for acquiring the true love of such a young beauty at his mid-age. From Aileen Chuang's view, he didn't even care about whether she hated him at her last moment of life.Ang Lee seems to be more moderate and merciful. He arranged true feelings from Mr. Yee and YuMin Kuang. Did he intend to console the soul of JiaZhi and the hearts of female audience with a slight beam of hope? Or did he just aim to defend for the brutality of men? When seeing YuMin Kuang mildly holding JiaZhi's shoulders and hearing his hollow promise that ""I would not get you hurt"", it's really disgusting to me and nearly aroused my anger. He and his peers built up their dreams of devoting to the country on the sacrifice of an innocent young woman's virginity, dignity, and safety of life. They were all bastards and trashes, according to my judgment. If this is love, what is worth expecting from life to us? Movie-goers keep asking did he ever love JiaZhi? Did Mr. Yee love her? Did anyone else ever love her? No, not really. I can tell without any hesitation. It's cruel but it's true. How pathetic that Ang Lee has made great efforts in disguising the fact that those guys never loved anyone except themselves in a couple of tear drops from Mr. Yee and the detestable smile from YuMin Kuang. Well, Ang Lee's a man himself anyway. I fully respect his talents in film-making. But talking about love between Mr. Yee and JiaZhi? It blurs the sanctity of the word LOVE.Totally opposite to those lousy guys, JiaZhi was beautiful, mild, and smart. With the bad luck in that dreary era, she doomed to be destroyed and end up in the tragic destiny of this kind or another. She was disappointed by everyone around her, undutiful father, utilitarian and spineless schoolmates. I have mentioned above that both Aileen Chuang and JiaZhi Wong were wise enough to see through the slyness and the cruelty of men. Of course she knew clearly about a man like Mr. Yee from the very beginning. She was absolutely aware of the fact that she's no more than a sex object. However, she still devoted her heart to him besides her body, because as least Mr. Yee made her feel that she's still alive. He awoke her vitality with lust and the diamond ring, which meant only a piece of jewelry or an expensive gift to men but more than that to a woman. A ring on finger is symbol of something beyond itself. As to the title of this work ""Se, Jie"", I prefer the translation version of ""Lust, Ring"" to ""Lust, Caution"". The ring is apparently the key of the whole story.","Lust, Caution"
91,grumpy736-1,Lust suppressed and simmered. Caution in abundance.,10,23 February 2008,"The story begins in Shanghai as it is being seized and occupied by Japan in 1940. The male lead is a collaborator with the Japanese, and the female lead is a patriotic drama student who is a friend of his wife. The students decide to use her access to the hated traitor, to assassinate him and it takes three years of caution and planning to fulfill. The production values were extravagant with beautiful cinematography, 1940s sets, music and costumes for that period, and well cast actors.As an old timer I enjoyed seeing the 1940s atmosphere and the political intrigue. I thought of Hitchock's Notorious during a couple of the scenes. I believe the script could have been nicely topped off if the final line was: C'est la guerre! Ang Lee's films are diverse and well executed. I've seen The Ice Storm, Hulk, Tiger/Dragon, Brokeback Mountain,and now Lust/Caution.A plus was seeing Joan Chen in a small role as Mrs. Yee.","Lust, Caution"
92,jhammond59,"Lust, caution are both on display",10,30 March 2010,"What a mesmerizing film this is. Although the pace does drag at times, particularly in the early moments of the film, putting in quicker cuts between scenes would have compromised the rest of the film. This is supposed to be a slow build, so the complete character can be revealed toward the end of the movie. Set design, locales, and cinematography were excellent. Freeze frame at almost any point and note the scope of Ang Lee's vision. The film is advertised as an espionage thriller, but that's more window dressing than reality. Lust, caution and obsession might be closer. Tony Leung and Wei Tang were amazing, and what a brave performance by Wei, who was later banned from performing for her role in this film. I noted in IMDb she was slated for a new film in production and I'd say it's about time. Some reviewers had incorrectly indicated this was an R-rated film, but it was released as NC-17 for the steamy sex scenes. These scenes were far more revealing of the characters, however, which was Ang Lee's focus. Without the impact of those scenes the actions of the two principals would lack motivation. Lust, caution is a haunting and dangerous vision of the conflict that shaped Chinese and Japanese relationships for decades after World War II. If you have the patience for the slow-developing but all together captivating interplay between Tong Leung and Wei Tang you will continue to be moved by at it once the screen goes dark.","Lust, Caution"

Not only are the sex scenes highly charged, they convey a progression of character development easily lost on the young.The camera work is so effective in conveying mood, scene and narrative that it might go un-noticed if I did not wonder if I might write for film. Time and again I was stunned by the mastery of technique displayed.The two leads are justly praised for their contributions: the one a welcome and familiar face, the other worth keeping in mind for the future.This film might be favorably compared to the Dutch film ""The Black Book,"" which takes place in similar circumstances. Where that involves betrayal on many levels and the protagonist survives with pluck and smarts, this is tightly drawn between just two people. Everyone else is subordinate to the central narrative of a young woman attempting to ensnare the most dangerous man in China at that time.Not for the squeamish, nor for slow readers - as the subtitles must carry a lot of content sometimes - but definitely worth seeing for anyone with the drive to appreciate fine artistry, a taste for foreign and historic situations, and a humble appreciation for the price our hearts may pay to do what we believe in most.","Lust, Caution"
95,George_Huang,A Rare Pure Cinematic Experience,10,25 September 2007,"A wolfhound brings out what Ang Lee so called ""amuck atmosphere."" This might not necessarily be Eileen Chang's intention, but Lee achieved his practical ""masterpiece"" through expressing his feel for this short story.Just right before the task seems about going to end, Wang Jiazhi memorized, from an innocent college girl to a highly skilled actress and patriot, this extremely dangerous ambition kept circling around her mind and couldn't possibly go away may because of her ideal of doing something big and important, may because of proving that she's not only a puppet, or may because of a man that she can't get him out of her head.A terrific ensemble cast. Tang Wei, who played the soul of the film, transformed herself into the leading character successfully through an unfamiliar face to audiences and has the acting of unattached perfection just like Zhang Ziyi. Though she got set up to get involved with this role by Lee, the result shows that her efforts worth every second.The best performance of Tony Leung by far, every look and movement is very precise. Though it's also postmodern and the same kind of costumes, the effect is totally different from the images in Wong Kar Wai movies. Even he has been through several villain characters, the devotion and outcome that he put in this role is never been seen before.As for the controversial sex scenes that gather all the spotlights, they all take important places in the film just as Lee said. Even there's no sign of sex in Chang's story. Except the power demonstration of the leading male role, Mr. Yee, Wang learned to use her sex power, the abreaction from the huge frustration of both their occupations and the struggle and joy they soaked in the functioning sex. They could very likely be the perfect match for each other that they can never find another one in this lifetime.The second-time Mexican cinematographer for Lee, Rodrigo Prieto, French musician Alexandre Desplat, the senior Korean designer Lai Pan, and Lee's longtime partner editor Tim Squyres. The global combination achieved the great technical support besides the compelling story and the feast of performances.The funny part is Lee chose short stories back to back for his film. The time line of the previous one goes across over 20 years. As for the latter one is just an afternoon. Sure it seems like a story in a decade, but after all they are the flashbacks of the leading female role.This movie definitely goes beyond the achievement of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" which is already very brilliant. While showing the conflict of sense and sensibility, it also pays tribute to a bunch of classics and the master creators which reflect the mind of the roles and are inherited such as ""Casablanca,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Suspicion,"" ""Penny Serenade,"" ""Last Tango in Paris"" and ""In the Realm of the Senses."" This is not only the best screen adaptation of Chang to date but also a must-see of all time.","Lust, Caution"
96,WeeWillie,Sizzling hot but slow moving thriller,10,1 March 2008,"NOTICE: I do touch on the plot, but not so as to spoil the movie...This long and sensuous movie set in 1942 Shanghai during the Japanese occupation is centered on a beautiful and elegant young woman Wong Chia Chi (played by newcomer Wei Tang) who - with her platonic friend Kuang Yu Min (played by Chinese male hottie Lee-Hom Wang) - is a willing participant in a group of 6 young actor friends who, caught up in a frenzy of nationalism, hatch a naïve plot to kill a powerful and secluded Chinese traitor Mr. Yee (played by Tony Leung Chiu Wai).As you might expect, Wong's part in this plot is to seduce Mr. Yee, and so, this story becomes a sizzling but dark story of a very dangerous affair of lust in the period in Chinese history where revolution is in the air but does not yet have China in its grip. In China's repressed sexual climate, the relationship between Kuang and Wong - for, of course, from the first he loves this dazzling girl  is a sub-plot that stirs in a real sense of pathos. An ominous pall  even a sense of dread - hangs over the entire story, and there is no hint of how it is to end.The story is certainly a thriller and, under Director Ang Lee, it is a gorgeous movie, punctuated with those breathtakingly understated Chinese dresses and perhaps the hottest sex scenes you have ever seen in the movies, but it proceeds at an agonizingly slow pace and is steeped in the Chinese way. As such it will be controversial for Western audiences, but for me, I see this as adding to Ang Lee's mystique as a movie-making magician.","Lust, Caution"
97,LayerCake,Lee's newest provocative film,9,13 October 2007,"Ang Lee's newest Chinese film is both poignant and shocking. It is this years masterpiece. Lee combines espionage with erotic love scenes, it's not the common pair in films nowadays but it works out for the best. Lust spans over the time line of 4 years in World War II torn Shanghai and Hong Kong. Tai Wei stars (in a near perfect performance) as Wong Chia Chi a young actress who is convinced to join the resistance with friend Kuang (Wang Leehom) to help seduce and assassinate Chinese traitor Mr. Yee (an amazing Tony Leung in an Oscar worthy performance). The film is incredibly detailed as well, and keeps your attention at each detail as well, whether it's mahjongg games with Mrs. Yee (Joan Chen) or a mind-numbing love scene where Mr. Yee tortures Wong Chia Chi like most of the victims he interrogates.The film became widely known when it received the dreaded NC-17 from the MPAA. In the screening I went to though, people seemed more shocked at the only violent scene in the film (that isn't mentioned in the films' rating) than the initially ""controversial"" sex scenes. The sex though was done tastefully, it was over the top, and it was heartfelt. Unlike most R-rated films nowadays. While watching the film I was also drawn into the wonderful world that Lee created. It had the look and feel of a former utopia that was now a hellish war torn city. It almost gave the feeling that I was there with the people.I can easily see this film getting an Adapted Screenplay nomination for the Oscars just like Lee's previous film the widely controversial 'Brokeback Mountain'. The film is based on Eileen Chang's short story with the same title. James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang made a great script, the dialog moved the film forward gracefully.Thanks to the MPAA though, a portion of the art-house audience won't be allowed to see this film. Take my word however, this film is worth getting a fake I.D. for.I give it a 9 out of 10","Lust, Caution"
98,b1le,Instructions for Movie Reflections: This Movie Works Like a Mirror,7,28 September 2008,"1. Inverse aspects of the CHARACTERS:There are people doing amoral things in the name of the moral cause: prostitution, prosecutions and assassinations in the name of patriotism.There is a woman who is constantly betraying her morals to stay true to her patriotic ideal and sacrifices self for the country.There is a man on the opposite end of the moral continuum, who betrayed the country for self-interest, but who nevertheless chooses to believe in another fellow human...an chooses love.2. Inverse aspects of the TITLE: The title declares that the movie ia about lust. The sexual scenes should make sure that no one doubts this. Except maybesome of us who felt that those scenes were not about lust at all. They were so heavily burdened by characters' suspicions and expectations, their thoughts and doubts, so that it was impossible to watch them as pure instinctive acts. Instead they were somewhat manipulative and acted out like a craft or even an art, maybe even the art of war. 3. Inverse moments in the STORY: IMHO, it is usually presumed that once the sexual tension is exhausted, the relationship potential is diminished, if the bond was so superficial. Hence, in scripts, be it life or a movie, where characters don't share history, mutual trust and respect, they should grow apart. They should become more rational, not emotional in time. The opposite happens in the movie. This too speaks volumes about the nature of their intercourse, substantial rather than just sexual. As it should be: intimate physical interaction leading to psychological connection, mutual discovering in the subtlest of details followed with resolving of the deepest problems.Biljana Gjoneska www.evermind.me","Lust, Caution"
99,bodhistore,"An intelligent, well made film with a great cast",9,13 December 2008,"Ang Lee has done a great job with this movie. The first quarter into the film I felt it to be slightly slow and was not sure where it was going. But as the story unfolds it picks up and becomes intriguing all the way to the end. The Chinese actors do a terrific job in this complex story, which is well presented by the director. I was surprised to see Chinese actors in the bold erotic scenes that are in the film, considering the conservative reputation China has. But all of this is necessary for the story in this film, and to capture and demonstrate the plot, the relation between the young girl Tang and Leung, and the sadistic nature of Leung, who plays Yee, the high official in Japanese-ruled Shanghai.Tang Wei is excellent in the movie as the innocent schoolgirl turned resistance fighter. She is disgusted with Leung but hides it well to get what the movement wants out of him. He is violent in his sexual courtship and she suffers with each hidden meeting they have. He is cruel to her, but she sacrifices herself for the resistance movement and their plans to eventually kill him. At the same time, she slowly softens up to him in moments where vulnerabilities show and she has one or two moments of affection which eventually fails their plans. All actors do a great job in their roles and fit the parts well.Lust, Caution is an intelligent movie. Its not silly or feel easily achievable. Its one of those heavyweights that you feel will have recognition with bigger movies out there.Asian cinema to me has always felt a bit immature and pure silly, intended for an audience of 4 year olds. But Chinese films that have reached our shores lately have completely changed this impression and stood out with great works like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, Curse of the Golden Flower(by Yimou Zhang), and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. I seldom buy movies to keep but have made an exception for Yimou Zhangs work. Although coming from a completely different culture and background, these movies manage to intrigue the audience in the west as well with their plots of honor and sacrifice, love and struggles.China apparently has enormous talents in the movie industry which we have been deprived of for too long in the west. Directors like Ang Lee and Yimou Zhang has completely opened my interest about China as a whole (never was interested at all before). I have great admiration for the work and skills of Lee and Zhang. I consider them amongst the top ten of the world's directors.","Lust, Caution"
100,divadrummer,Proceed with Caution,5,1 December 2007,"Lust, Caution is a polarizing film. I suspect some will see this and love it for the setting, intrigue, costumes, and subtle characterizations. Others will find it plodding, opaque, and full of unsympathetic characters. While I realize most drama deals with topics that are unsettling, Lust, Caution brought it to a new level for me: I was so uncomfortable I very nearly left.Lust, Caution is a tale about a group of Shanghai college students turned assassin during WWII and the Japanese occupation of China. They plan on murdering Mr. Yee, a government official with ties to the Japanese presence. It's a classic Mata Hari-type tale with a new circumstance and a fresh setting. Wang Jiazhi is a young actress with manipulation and deceit skills that border on the supernatural. Despite the ineptitude of her classmates, she easily takes on an alias, infiltrates Mr. Yee's social circle, seduces him, and falls in love.We can read Wang Jiazhi's character a few different ways. She can be a naive woman caught up in something much larger than herself, and highly sympathetic. While this isn't precisely wrong, I saw something more: Wang Jiazhi is an extremely twisted character; a devil in a blue dress, and a true femme fatale. She agrees to become a spy not just for acceptance among her peers, but to prove to herself and everyone that she can be a starlet. She's obsessed with movies, and learns to cry on cue. She takes on a life of lies as if it were her own, without hesitation, with seemingly little promise of reward or personal benefit, beyond being able to hobnob with the wealthy and dangerous. When Mr. Lee has sex with her for the first time, he's horribly violent, and she seems to enjoy every minute of it, smirking to herself once Mr. Lee's left her. She does protest to her friends, but I can't tell if she harbors a genuine hatred for her job, or is simply waffling. Eventually, Wang Jiazhi lets her selfish and materialistic ambitions completely overshadow her original goal, and endangers all her friends. Reprehensible.Beyond having a heroine I hate, Lust, Caution has a paper-thin premise. None of the 6 students involved in the espionage seem to have any strong motivations, with the exception of Kuang Yu Min, whose family was killed by Mr. Yee. None of the supporting characters get much screen time, and their portrayals are callously one-dimensional and forgettable. The assassination group is woefully unequipped to deal with assassinating Mr. Yee, and they owe their success completely to the talents of Wong Jiazhi. Before she seduces Mr. Yee, the students convince Wong Jiazhi to do something unthinkable, which seems to have very little practical value in reality or in the story, except to introduce shock value into the movie - about an hour in, and it gets better (worse?) from there.The sex in this movie is so explicit it's pornographic. Except instead of being turned on (because I do enjoy porn), I found myself burying my head into my husband's arm, which is a position I usually only reserve for horror scenes. These scenes are important, as they're some of the only scenes that establish the dynamics of the relationship between Mr. Yee and Wang Jiazhi. However, these graphic scenes are so frequent and so long, they're simply gratuitous. We're voyeurs looking in on an extremely unhealthy relationship - the sex appeal is gone and replaced with the grit of realism.Some of the editing made the film hard to follow, particularly at the beginning, when events are explored non-chronologically, without any exposition. Through all the movie, there's an importance on significant glances, and if you're not clued into them, you might miss some of the story. The film achieves some success at noir, and I found the cultural portrayals to be interesting and accurate (from what I know).Lust, Caution aims for high cinema and loses credibility in the loose story, shallow secondary characters, and shocking sex scenes. What could have been a coy romance is stripped of its charm when the covers come off and we realize how emotionally immature our heroine is. See this film if the concept captivates you. Anything less may leave you bored, confused, or nettled.","Lust, Caution"
101,KJacob73,Judge LUST CAUTION a day later.,10,29 September 2007,"When I saw LUST CAUTION yesterday I wasn't sure what to think. There were moments of transcendence and many others of what, at the time, seemed like tedium. I was frustrated that I couldn't decide if this was a masterpiece right away as I was with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, THE ICE STORM, and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON. When I woke up this morning I couldn't stop thinking about it. It has haunted me all day and I want to see it again. Perhaps my expectations were so high that I had trouble appreciating what I was watching. More than likely I was anticipating the already notorious sex scenes. In any case LUST CAUTION is another masterpiece by Ang Lee that may take time for some to appreciate it. Years to come it will be studied and watched compulsively. It will strike debate among cinephiles of its worth. Most importantly it will be a film to be treasured, perhaps not by many, but by a very enlightened few.During the sex scenes I was holding my breath. Lee's slow burn toward these instant classic scenes was like foreplay leading to an explosive climax. Lee's themes of repression and double lives continue in LUST CAUTION. I look forward to savoring and arguing about this film for years to comes.","Lust, Caution"
102,dianewds,"Powerful, Mastercrafted Writing/Direction/Cinematography",9,20 October 2007,"Ang Lee proves masterful again - one of the best films this year (foreign or domestic). Lee dares to envision and go where others won't or cannot and does so with such elegance and impact. The film set in pre-Shanghai revolution era (Hong Kong and Shanghai). Dialogues open with fast-paced-authentic-to-Chinese-culture-and-idiosyncrasies women playing at mahjong table. At the table is the lovely protagonist (Tang Wei) and antagonist's wife (Joan Chen) and enter antagonist, Tony Leung Chiu Wai). One initially struggles slightly to keep up with the sub-titles but the camera does such a good job at translating the action that what word or two gets missed is nuanced in meta-message. Also, relief comes soon as we are transported back in time to how the drama begins. This longer film is worth every moment. It engages from start to finish packing top-notch acting from entire cast, superior camera, lighting, costumes and set work. This thrilling espionage takes the viewer through a vast array of mature, complex motives and feelings, intricately woven betwixt and between the contrastual tapestry of the bourgeois and horrors of war. The violence and sex are raw but done in a way to perfectly reflect the characters juxtaposed to wartime/freedom fighter tension. The craftsmanship of this film will no doubt claim awards and will stand the test of time.","Lust, Caution"
103,jrweyrich,Amazing Film,10,8 November 2007,"I saw this film last night and was just stunned with the visual beauty and the quality of the acting by each cast member. If this film doesn't make Hollywood draft Tony Leung ASAP, then nothing will. I want to see him in an American film. I have been waiting ever since ""Happy Together"". I was sure we would see him after ""In the Mood for Love"", I was sure some American director would immediately use him. He will certainly take the Golden Horse & Hong Kong awards next year. The question is will Hollywood have the smarts to nominate him. A fabulous actor! Ang Lee is just superb at his craft. How soon can we have another film from him? The details in every scene will require repeated viewings. It was great to see Joan Chen & the new young actors. A wonderful assembly of young talent. Ang Lee always seems to get the best out of actors--in every film.","Lust, Caution"
104,Cecil-B,"Fascinating and heartfelt, a very ""foreign"" film for Westerners.",8,12 September 2009,"The capsule version of this films story--Chinese ""resisters"" attempt to assassinate a high-ranking collaborator who works for Japanese occupiers in 1930's China--tells us only that most of us are going to be watching a bit of history about which we know nothing. While reasonably educated Westerners don't need to be told much about the ""good"" guys and the ""bad"" guys in stories about collaborators in Nazi-occupied Europe, we don't come to a tale about Japanese occupiers in Asia during the period of Japanese imperial aggression in the 20th century armed with much information. In fact, without doing further research on this subject I don't even know that I am referring to the period correctly.So let's start with the assumption that we are ignorant outsiders trying to grasp the historical underpinnings of the story we're watching. Add to that difficulty the fact that hardly any of us in the U.S. know much about Asian cultures. I could see that the film is rich in period detail and cultural nuance, but that doesn't mean that I ""got"" what I was seeing. Just take the issue of ""Mah Jongg"". While my late mother-in-law played the game, and she was a second-generation European-American, not a ""Shanghaiese"", I imagine that if she had seen the movie she would have picked up the mechanical significance of the game play that was shown on screen, but she would NOT have gotten the cultural meanings of the plays and misplays that seemed to cause raised eyebrows and post-game sniping among the players. Consider how well we in the States understand the implications of the game of Poker, and further, we even make adjustments for the context or setting of the game. My mother-in-law could have told us that a certain lady was about to win the game, but that would have been just a small piece of a full interpretation of the game's events.And so it goes... Here we are in the West just beginning to understand that Koreans don't appreciate being called Chinese, and the movie requires us to understand that people from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Canton regard one another as members of very different cultures. Apparently there are many languages that are lumped together under the rubric ""Chinese"", but even the most similar among them may be as different as the Romance languages are from one another.In watching this movie we are strangers in a ""strange"" (to us) land. Yet I found the foreground story concerning a young Chinese woman's efforts to seduce a Chinese collaborator (so that she could get him killed) remarkably affecting. Ang Lee explores the difficult questions that occur when someone pretends to love someone and in the course of that pretense suffers pain and humiliation. And are the unintended effects of engaging in this complicated ""relationship"" made even less predictable if the target of the duplicity is sufficiently disarmed to show some trust, some caring, some vulnerability. What happens to the potential assassin when the ""monster"" turns out to have human qualities?Finally, something needs to be said about the frank depiction of sex in this film--NEEDS to be because so much has already been made of it. People who are serious students of film really consider only the cinematic issues and not those that might interest members of a general audience some of whom take automatic offense at displays of skin and simulations of sexual intercourse. If you're looking for a review or comment that deals with the ""propriety"" of such material or its ""suitability"" for Old Aunt Bessie or Little Billy, there are whole websites that can offer you their insights. My analysis asks only whether the heaving intertwined naked bodies added anything to the story.My answer is equivocal, or uncertain. We are shown long sequences of very intense sexual activities which generate in the participants not only the physical reaction of orgasm but also the feelings that accompany what we're seeing. While the sex is harsh, and fairly gymnastic, it is not preposterous or false-looking in the manner of pornography. One gets the impression that the highly contained ""official"" is actually able to unwrap his restraints in these almost tortured sessions, and that he is immensely grateful for the moment of freedom. I do not think that the intensity of the sex or even her orgasms have the same kind of meaning for the young woman. Her reaction is more complicated than that....Which is my answer to the question about the cinematic value of all that skin and boning. It's a tough area of life to explore on screen, isn't it. I'm going to give the auteur his props for trying.As with other worthwhile films that I've seen, Lust Caution serves as impetus for further exploration of historical and psychological questions. All in all, Lust Caution delivers a lot, especially when one considers that we in the West were not considered as the primary audience for whom it was made. Let me also add that even when I didn't understand its words or the story I loved the pictures. There must be a million frames in that movie that could be made into wonderful photographs. Sit back, relax, watch, listen, and THINK.","Lust, Caution"
105,Ivna,Almost Flawless,8,25 November 2007,"I am not a fan of Ang Lee. I hate crouching tiger and I do not want to talk about hulk. I am a fan of shanghai. The setting appealed to me. There is war, there is electric tram, there is cheongsum, there is nothing more i can ask for. The film is based on a famous novel of Zhang Ai Ling, so not much credit for the plot should go to Lee.It was mature direction which stood out. It never look at my watch a single time while watching it. It shows experience and skill in how the story developed. I cannot think of any irrelevant or redundant scenes. Scenes like Yee Tai Tai meeting Mai Tai Tai and the six of them being executed were things we can picture and were cliché. Lee did away with these scenes.Casting was another strength of Lee. Tang Wei is a like a ghost of the past. She should be living in the forties. She is too natural and no matter in what attire, she is stylish and elegant. I can never forget the look of Tony Leung during the last sex scene. Those sex scenes were battles. It made me pondered who was the prey and who was the predator. In a nutshell, it was good acting.I gave it 8/10. One point missing for the lack of meaningful and powerful dialogues. Some lines could be improved on. The last point for emotions. It did move me a bit, but I thought with such a plot Lee can actually bring tears to my eyes. I believe there should be more character development on Mr Yee. There should be a scene of him interrogating one rebel in the middle of the film, rather than him describing it. After witnessing it, we can relate the manner of the interrogation to the sex scenes, which will make those scenes more powerful.I was surprised by the element of humour which was present in the film. Wrapping this up, it is something you should watch in the theater, not anywhere else.","Lust, Caution"

107,matheson_dunross,For Love and the Tony Leung,7,27 October 2007,"I saw the full, uncut version in Taipei and was not, still am not, sure if I like this film; but Lost, Caution certainly is one of best Ang Lee has ever done.The espionage part of the story is very naive, you'd think it idiotic almost. And yet it worked, not really because of the wisdom and training provided by Kuang Yu Min and Wu; but because of Wang Jiazhi. This is where my dislike of the film comes in, Tang Wei was good, but her Wang Jiazhi was completed overshadowed by Tony Leung's Mr. Yee, there is a feeling of lost balance about all of their scenese together.Ang Lee did do a wonderful piece of storytelling by having Yu Min appear out of nowhere to recruit Jiazhi, sometime after she went to see Penny Serenade. Unfortunately, that is - if you get it.Jiazhi went to see a movie after she received a letter from her father, informing her that he will no longer attempt to get her out of China; and she chose to see Penny Serenade - the story about a couple and their beloved adopted daughter Penny, and how devastated they became after her death. The contrast is brilliant and direct, you can feel your heart wrought and the despair Jiazhi must have felt - ONLY if you are familiar with old movies! For those who are not, they would have been misled by the Chinese title, which translates into ""Moonlight Love Song"", and thought that she just wanted to find a place to cry her heart out.This scene is small but significant, it shows that Jiazhi's resolution to go back into the espionage world is not really derived from patriotism; but from her desperate need to escape from feeling lonely and abandoned, that she will do just about anything to give her life a purpose.And then she looked up from the Mahjong tiles at the equally lonely Mr. Yee (I need not comment on Tony Leung, his acting speaks for itself), and the rest is history.....","Lust, Caution"
108,sawyerheights,Lee Has A Dim View of Women,7,24 September 2008,"The ending of the movie was a shocking reminder that not all celebrated film ""artists"" have an enlightened view of women. Lee would have us believe that his character Mak Tai Tai would be so swept up in a few rather emotionally barren yet physically steamy sexual encounters with the monster Mr. Yee that she would betray her friends and herself. This despite her knowledge of the brutality of Japanese rule in China, especially as administered by Yee. Moreover, Lee perpetuates the outrageous notion that a woman being raped can somehow end up enjoying the sexual attack. He wants us to believe that she developed some sort of emotional connection through sex, lustful attention, and a gaudy gift from Yee, despite Yee's distant and unfeeling treatment of women generally, not just Mak Tai Tai. Notably, in Lee's dynamic, it is the woman who ultimately surrenders all common sense and caution through lust, not the man. Mr. Yee keeps his head and flees at her suggestion, and proceeds to execute her and her friends, despite feeling bad about it. The only way Lee's shameful rendering of a woman's viewpoint would be believable is if he had convincingly portrayed Mak Tai Tai as a completely dysfunctional soul who had been mistreated by men in her life to the point that she could only function in a relationship by being dominated by the male to her detriment. To the contrary, Mak Tai Tai was an independent, bright woman caught in a tough life along with millions of her Chinese counterparts under Japanese occupation. I rated the movie as I did because of the wonderful photography, acting and pace preceding the end. If I had to rate it solely on my comments above, I would have given it a one. Clearly, Lee has developed keen insights into how two males may achieve a mature and moving emotional connection in an affair (Brokeback Mountain), but has no clue as to what makes women tick.","Lust, Caution"
109,lupinyiu,Sentimental Mutation Visualized in Sexual Sequences,7,26 September 2007,"It is a film of a young woman's prowess and tragedy narrated with a flashback between two current sequences. In a mixed genre of adultery and espionage, the story is told in a unrestricted narrative in which the audience are disseminated with full information some characters don't have. Despite the unrestrictedness in the knowledge domain of the audience, tension mounts on when Jiazhi Wang (Wei Tang) embarks on her mission to assassinate her target as the audience are puzzled with the leads' staging and other diegetic hints on whether or not her identity is or will be exposed.Director Lee packs the film with sex, a common element of the genre. Lee establishes Wang as a cool girl in the expository sequences by use of apathetic expression (actually a non-expression) under freeze staging. Down the plot, Wang apparently remains tough and firm in her mission, as revealed from her dialogues. Nevertheless, Lee portrays Wang's evolutionary attitude toward Mr. Yee (Tony Leung) essentially by use of the 3 sex sequences in which Wang behaviorally shifts from being passive to active. As a mirrored portray, Mr. Yee's calmness (and seriousness as well) is seen alleviated by his disclosure of his job to Wang in the last hour of the story. Lee in practice builds up a subtle, slow-paced escalation of passion and psychological mutation of both leads, culminating to the diegetic climax.The carefully choreographed overt sex sequences, in a whole, are instrumental in portraying the evolution of subdued passiveness of Wang toward her target. The sequences witness Wang's gradual sentimental change from taking up a hunting job in fulfillment of her patriotic duty to the nation to an ever deepening voluntary enchantment with her target. Lee goes further from his ""Brokeback Mountain"" to enhance the degree of explicitness by bringing the leads' body/pubic hairs, Wang's underarm hairs in a close-up in particular, into mise-en-scene to connote the rawness and liberation of the couple's desires.With the acts of excruciation and execution of spies brought off screen, Lee keeps violence to the minimum despite the blood shedding sequence in the Hong Kong apartment in an earlier plot. There is a slight change of cinematographic style in the film: fast cutting and swish pans at the beginning; slow cutting, static camera and occasional tracking from the middle to the epilogue. While both leads exercise caution along their ways in concealing their respective motives, rationality is, consciously and unconsciously, marooned by lust, the desire for love and sentiments, which eventually render betrayal and fiasco. The film is a narrative on the subordination of rationality to long suppressed emotion and passion.","Lust, Caution"

However, I have seen only few movies which actually tell a story that would not be complete without showing bold sex scenes. The ""Lust, Caution"" is one of these movies.This movie is long and goes onward very slowly, but it manages to create a unforgettable atmosphere to a patient viewer. The set and actors make a good work in creating the picture of upper-class life in WWII in Hong Kong and Shanghhai and the resistance towards Japanese occupiers.The actual story is about a student girl who becomes an agent infiltrating near to Japanese supporting officials. The plot is quite simple, but it manages still leave a lot of thinking to the viewer.","Lust, Caution"

113,azzurra-ying,Too extreme for my liking,6,21 October 2007,"Li An's movies have always been to me to be missing in ""something"". This movie sort of nailed it - the movies have all been kinda extreme when it comes to depiction of love. Brokeback mountain was removed of the author's original cold tonality tied up with the vast backdrop of barren-ness and poverty of the west; and nearly made out to be a warm, emotional tear-jerker akin to early fighting-feudalistic-restrictions-on-free-love type of Taiwanese romance novels. I'm not posing to be a connoisseur of movies or the novels, but that's at least how that felt to me. In this movie, Zhang Ailing's signature tonality of indifference and barrenness is once again extremified to hammer into the viewer this extremely depressing story (Zhang Ailing's major characters have almost invariably been female, pretty, silent, intense and inevitably violated). There were plenty of such incredible stories and people around at that time and I just don't need to be hammered in the senses again and again with one of them in such lurid details. The capping of it all with some vague theme of aspects of love tied up with a possible obligation to feel sympathetic towards the heroine just didn't manage to touch, stir or even stimulate me. On a different note, I do appreciate the bringing to life of the culture and people of that great city of old Shanghai (even though Jiazhi's invariably blue-themed Qi gowns are quite depressing). The city has its shortcomings but it's really the true cosmopolitan and fashionable city of China.","Lust, Caution"
114,Xanan,First class wartime thriller,10,3 February 2008,"The film revisits a harrowing and crucial event in recent Asian history - the Japanese occupation during WWII and all the horrors that came with it.In this match between the reserved collaborationist chief of police and the innocent student turned brave spy for the Chinese resistance, complex emotions, such as patriotism, courage, honour, loneliness, hate, love and betrayal, are quietly and provocatively depicted.It is in the (few) sex scenes that the film's emotions become so powerful and character-defining. The story's chief male character expresses himself mainly through those sex scenes, at first violently, as if angry against himself. The young heroine, in turn, learns the art of seduction confidently in order to help kill a traitor, but her patriotic duty soon becomes intolerable, as expressed by her tears in the aftermath of passionate love-making. It is in one later scene, at a Japanese brothel, that lust is finally seen as developing into mutual love.Direction, acting, score, cinematography and costumes are all first class in this compelling wartime thriller.The film also pays tribute to film noir masterworks, such as ""Casablanca"" and ""Suspicion"", as well as other classics such as ""Last Tango in Paris"".Oscar worthy (even if strangely neglected).","Lust, Caution"
115,lee_sybil,Something left me pondering,10,8 December 2007,"I went to see this movie with a big group of people. Funny thing is, the review was either loved it or felt it was just OK... And i found those who loved it are all over 30. First of all, I found a lot of people who didn't like it because they could not understand the whole history of the Japanese occupation in Asia during war world two. That part of Chinese history happened to my parents, so it was a very vivid memory to them and therefore we have heard it all..I was a bit concerned about the more than 2.5 hours long viewing, but as I sat through it, I was not feeling a bit bored.. The story proceeds smoothly. My emotions were building up as the movie was going along. By the end of it, when Mr. Yee sat on the bed Wong had slept on before, I could not stop my tears from falling for more than 5 minutes. That really surprised me. I don't usually cry during movies,but somehow,this film just gripped me like never before. I just felt this deep deep sadness washing over me and i could not stop it.Tony Leung, has always been a great actor. This time, i think he had achieved another level. A look from him can express so much. Some people think the sex scenes are too graphic and unnecessary. While i was sitting in the cinema watching this with others, who i don't really know that well, it did make me feel a bit awkward. However, i think all the sex was the way for two lonely people to feel less alone in a desperate time. Yes, it's not a movie for"" entertainment"".

117,neaonbhb,A truly terrible film that I really wanted to like,1,21 June 2011,"So. In the interest of full disclosure I should probably point out that my wife is Chinese, had heard good things about this movie, and half- drug me to the theater to see it. I wasn't opposed to seeing it, I just didn't have any strong feelings about it one way or the other. Boy oh boy, did that change after I stumbled from the theater, noticeably dumber. How an exceptional film maker like Lee could make a movie like this with so much potential and fail on so many levels I have no idea, but this movie is a meteoric rocket crashing to earth with a dull, lifeless thud.Of course, my wife (again, being Chinese), loved the movie. Well, maybe she didn't love it, but she liked it. Its probably not on her top 10 list or anything, but she might like to watch it again.Long review short, if you're a Chinese woman, you might like this film. If you're a discerning movie goer that is critical of what you see and doesn't take anything at face value, you very well might hate this film.So how does this movie fail?The problems with the movie are almost unilaterally a reflection on the motivation of its characters. They continually choose to do things and act in ways that are utterly and ridiculously opposite to how a real person might really act in that situation. The group refuses to act out their plan unless their prey makes 3 steps forward. Mak runs screaming down a street like a child when the group succeeds in the murder of a target. Mak falls in love with Yee while he treats her like trash, property and an object. Mak progresses from just standard female stupidity into full-blown sexist stereotype when she sells out not only herself, but the entire group, for the gift of... wait for it... a diamond ring! Was this movie bought and paid for by Zales?? ""Oh, here's a big diamond, THIS proves my love for you (not when I was smacking you around a while back...)""Its weird, but the movie works better as a cautionary tale for women and their notorious materialism -- ""Watch out ladies, if you think a diamond is the same thing as love, you might find yourself getting shot in the back of the head in a ditch"" -- than it does as a drama or suspenseful film. Of course, there's no need to sit through almost three hours of beautiful garbage to get that point across. Even the heavily publicized love-making scenes were difficult to enjoy. Wei has a beautiful body, but the way she accepts being treated like a punching bag/sex-toy is just uncomfortable to watch and never sensual or erotic as it is meant to appear. If you enjoy those love-making scenes, you've probably also considered tying up a woman in your basement. And really, her accepting that treatment makes sense from the perspective of a spy trying to kill Yee, falling in love makes ZERO sense.Which is of course the final straw that broke the camel's back of realism. The fumbling inanity of this group of rebels fits better in the 3 stooges than in a serious drama/suspense. The silly requirements they put on themselves for killing Yee are laughable and CLEARLY represent an effort by the writers to extend the story. None of their reasoning or efforts make any sense. Why must Yee step inside the house on the dark, deserted street with no one for miles around before they kill him? Why must Yee be at a perfect spot in the jeweler's store and have been there for X minutes and have everyone be given the Go to kill him before killing him? Why can't Mak smuggle in a gun, or a knife, or some poison, or a ligature, or SOMETHING into their numerous lovemaking sessions to kill him with? Its all done in the service of extending the story, and if one thinks about it, as the writers are hoping you will not, the whole story falls apart.The ending brings us welcome release - FINALLY those incompetent fools that wasted three hours of our life are dead and we can stumble back to our cars. Save yourself! If you're doing it for the nudity, just rent a porno! If you're doing it for a wife... well... sorry to hear that. Grin and bear it I guess.","Lust, Caution"
118,potteries,Coloured ring,9,8 January 2012,"The title of the film ""Lust, Caution"", may also be read in Chinese as a ""coloured ring"", which is the object of crucial significance in the film. The pink-coloured diamond ring signifies the love that Mr Yee had for Chia Chi which Chia Chi realized when she put on the ring in the shop, where a trap was set for Mr Yee. In this pivotal moment, she then made the crucial decision to save her lover, warned him to get away, and as a result, sealed her own fate. Some people criticized the film for being too explicit, which I think missed the point of the film title. Like the film title, which says it's about lust (and ostensibly a warning against it), so in the film, the explicitness made it seems like it's about lust. In fact it's actually about love - Chia Chi's lack of love in her life, and when she found it in Mr Yee, she was prepared to sacrifice herself and her belief for her lover. The love is symbolised by the coloured ring, a possible reading of the film title, and the dual-meaning of the film title encapsulates the duality in the film, and the more important element is the love, not the lust.This film can be seen as a companion piece to Brokeback Mountain. At the end of the film when Mr Yee sat on her bed and realized what he had lost, mirrors the ending scene of Brokeback Mountain with Ennis with Jack's shirt in the closet. Both grieved for the lost love, except that in Mr Yee's case it was him that sent his own true love to death. What's captured in the ending sequence in both films is the image of loss, regret and loneliness of both men.","Lust, Caution"
119,jazzcorporation,This film should be consigned to the south quarry.,5,14 January 2008,"I can't understand why everyone is so enthusiastic about Lust Caution; perhaps it's some kind of reflex response to a new release from a revered auteur. Sure the film looks great and the sets are marvellous, but any film suggesting that even if you are an irredeemable sadistic bitch-slapping psychopath, buy a girl some bling and she will sacrifice herself and her friends to save you, belongs with its victims in the south quarry.If you want to see a film about a symbiotic sadomasochistic relationship which is actually believable, check out the vastly superior Secretary.","Lust, Caution"
120,rbjeremy,If you are lost; it is no fault of Li An's,8,19 January 2008,"This is a Chinese film. Made with the sensitivity and sensibility of a meticulous Chinese director. At the end of the film, Mr. Yee sacrifices his Love for patriotism and Jia Zhi sacrifices patriotism for Love. The film is based in a period of turbulence where simultaneous to resistance struggle against the Imperial Japanese Army was the Civil War between the KMT (Nationalist Army) and the Communist Army. Many reviewers are concerned with the sex scenes which were nothing more than a metaphor for domination (first sex scene) and lust and finally passion where the two protagonists without so much a word of endearment falls in love and in the historical status quo beyond their control surrenders it. Mr. Yee's act of love by the gift of the diamond ring was initially construed as a conspiracy thereby ending up in the tragedy. It is an illustration of the national dichotomy. In spite of its length, the film was neither boring nor long drawn. It was full of suspense : the physical war between the imperialists and local populace and the war that was raging between the interlocking political Parties due to differences in ideology. Li An though has not brought this out in a detailed and explanatory manner has somehow blended them into the background of the plot. And finally when it was all over Mr. Yee returns home and sat on the bed, I burst into tears for the personal tragedy which has been shaped and caused by divided ideology of the fractions. The acting and especially of Tang Wei's was very good and very convincing. Jia Zhi at the offset was not particularly involved in the patriotic movement : the movies she went to watch on her own were Western Movies; the books she took to school were books in English; her father was in England and she was expected to join him. Even the clothes that she wore was meant to reflect her role for the moment : from Western designs to the traditional Qi Bao. It seems to me that it was more of peer pressure than a specific sense of patriotism that she was involved in the plot. Probably it was also due to her hope to be near Yu Min. Her infatuation for him was admitted when she made up her mind on the man in her life. With every film of this nature; some background knowledge would be useful to put the film in its historical context. From what I can gather the reviewers who gave bad reviews were those who failed to see that context and like most people who do not want to think beyond their initial reaction; this film is lost on them. No fault of Li An. With ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Lust Caution""; Li An is well on his way to become one of the great directors to emerge in the last twenty years. I believe that where his films are unsatisfactory, the studios have interfered too much. This is evident by the fact that all his uneven films are inevitably American Films with an American Cast.","Lust, Caution"
121,mcollin6,Not another dissection,9,27 October 2007,"I had a visceral reaction to this film. Not to the sex or at least not only to the sex. People do and probably always will make decisions in a time of passion be it political, moral, or sexual, that after a time of more rational thought they might not have made. That is what makes us human. This film is about the human condition. I thought it was amazing. I can understand how this film could be difficult to make. This film was at times painful to watch. Painful but well worth the uncomfortable thoughts in provoked.From a purely artistic standpoint, I thought the photography was also beautiful and the images of the time and place were as good as any I have ever seen.","Lust, Caution"
122,Harker207,Ang Lee has a serious problem with women...,7,8 November 2007,"The film overall is, as people have said, a fascinating study in a time and place that has been cinematically unexplored. What other people haven't mentioned that has astonished me is his attitude towards women reflected in this film.The lead has one of the most incredible scenes in cinema, when she articulates her hatred of the collaborator when he rapes her and how she wishes they'd come in and kill him. The resisters repress her further and don't want to hear about what she's going through. It's poignant and incredible. Her hatred comes through so clearly, as well as what she has sacrificed of herself and her sexuality for the sake of patriotism (Lee in a Q&A said the film was a study in the conflict between patriotism and female sexuality). However, her hatred gets gradually replaced (completely unrealistically!) with a love for the human side of the collaborator that we never really see. In the end, she ignores all the emotional and sexual abuse he has put her through, for the sake of a large diamond, or so it would seem.Lee thinks he has made a film about impossible romantic love. And perhaps there are those that view it as that. I cannot help but see it as a film that demonstrates a deep dislike for women and a dismissal of their ability to choose right action over the ""love"" of a man.","Lust, Caution"
123,snowerlewn,"Ang Lee's masterpiece, Cultural nuances in the way of understanding",9,16 April 2008,"Ang Lee's Lust, Caution got a lot of negative reviews in the US. I was shocked. I always thought Lee, of all people, could convey the nuances of Chinese culture to a Western audience.I admit I love this movie, as I do all his work, except The Hulk. And I'm not implying you have to give it the thumbs-up because it won the Golden Lion. However, after reading dozens of reviews from mainstream media in North America, I have a strong feeling that most critics failed to understand the movie - not only the subtleties, but even some of the plot. Of course, the two are often interconnected.Rex Reed of The New York Observer called Mrs Yee ""silly"" because he assumed she is oblivious to her husband's trysts with other women. This couldn't be further from the truth. From how she reacts to her husband's emotional breakdown in the last scene, it is obvious she is in the know. There are Chinese wives who feign ignorance of their husbands' affairs, and this is probably something an American film critic cannot grasp. Shouldn't she be throwing a tantrum? They might ask.Rex continues: ""Neither of the two stars look like they're having much fun."" I wonder what movie he was watching. Of course they were not having fun. This is not a romantic comedy. The lady is scheming to kill him, and he is figuring out whether she is another beautiful assassin sent his way. They are both walking on razor's edge, which is not a fun activity.Most critics call the movie a spy thriller without realizing the multiple layers of the story. It is mostly psychological, with the two leads constantly testing each other and using a language rich in undertones. Almost every line has so much texture it could take a few more lines to decipher.Many see a resemblance with films of similar plots, such as Paul Verhoeven's Black Book and Hitchcock's Notorious. But they fail to see the link to previous Lee masterpieces such as Sense and Sensibility and Brokeback Mountain. Think of it. ""Lust"" is ""sensibility"" while ""caution"" is ""sense"". Both leads - and even some of the supporting characters - have to maintain a life of caution for self-survival. When they succumb to lust or passion, they pay the ultimate price.The three sex scenes received such widespread misinterpretation that trimming them might not be the terrible idea it should be. People got so carried away with the S&M and acrobatic couplings that they forgot to detect the symbolic meanings. The scenes epitomize their relationship, from domination, to distortion, to harmony. That's something a simple head shot could not convey. And it does not necessarily imply the lady loves to be tortured. That would be the same as saying she is a gold-digger who falls for a precious diamond.The definite moment when she falls for him is at the Japanese club when he reveals his weakness. (He has a hunch his future as a collaborator is doomed.) She has a soft spot not for his power and money, but for the latent humanity he finally lays bare. The big stone just confirms his feelings for her, in her mind.American critics are quick to pick up the clues of Hollywood movies that appear in the meticulously portrayed old Shanghai and have found an allusion to Hitchcock's Notorious, but nobody seems to have noticed that Mr Yee's every move is watched by his secretary, who knows his lover's secret identity and will probably bring about his downfall.Human emotions writ large can transcend boundaries. It is the niceties that cause cultural misunderstandings.","Lust, Caution"
124,herman_chiu,A great journey of humanity,10,11 October 2007,"Recently, I had a chance to visit HK and during the trip I took some time to see the film. As the movie has been showing in HK for over two week, I was surprised to see that it was still almost full house. The pace of movie is actually too slow for my taste. But after seeing the movie, I cannot think of deleting any scene which is unnecessary from the movie. The pace is exactly what I would expect from Ang Lee's movie: slow burning. I would like to point out one thing: the performance by Tan Wei in the movie. It is tremendous and perhaps the performance of a lifetime. I would say her performance is no less or even more powerful than what I had seen from Holly Hunter's in ""The Piano"" or Helen Hunt in ""As good as it gets"". The level of intensity can only be matched in recent film like Philips Seymour Hoffman in ""Capote"" or earlier one like Malon Brando in ""Apocalypse Now"". They are all possessed by the characters of the role. The unfolding process of the character is also similar to ""Apocalypse Now: the finding of the heart of darkness in each one of them along the plots of the movie. Main characters like Kuan and students, Mr. Yee, and Ms. Wong as well, in the movie all went through this grueling process of uncovering their darker selves in the dangerous timing of humanity-the Japanese Occupied Shanghai of World War II. I thank Ang Lee to bring forward this great project. It is not easy for him or us as it take both of us to hell to find out the fragility of humanity.","Lust, Caution"
125,iamconfounded,More than just a spy thriller: a portrait of a maelstrom,9,15 October 2007,"""Lust, Caution"" is a picture of the power of tremendous forces on that which is ultimately unable to bear the strain: a picture of a tidal wave crushing victims, or of a hurricane ripping through buildings.There have been many reviews of how this movie suffers in intrigue, and lacks in the typical Hollywood excitement and fireworks. *This is not simply a spy flick!* These reviewers might also observe a natural disaster and comment on how the buildings were all poorly constructed and the victims too weak to provide sufficient excitement and entertainment.Tang Wei, Ang Lee & co have put together a brilliant depiction of a dark and haunting time when the common person was buffeted and often destroyed by the struggle between titanic powers, emotions, and ideas.Tang Wei as Wang Jiazhi stands out especially as a perfect victim for the emotional and psychological blows that she suffers from the beginning to her last moments on camera. Floundering in the maelstrom of the time, Wang Jiazhi fights valiantly to grasp at something, anything to justify her existence. The sacrifices she makes and trials she endures become a dark and painful comedy of errors that will be even more poignant for those who can understand her predicament and the times Wang Jiazhi lives in. Each time, Wang convinces herself to plunge headlong into her endeavors:********spoilers start***********1. She sacrifices safety for the chance at love, achieving only a passing admiration and infatuation. 2. She discards innocence (with the worst possible candidate) for a patriotic cause, gaining only a bloody consolation for a lost prize. 3. She sells her inheritance for a chance to study, only to be forced to learn something she despises. 4. She suffers the unspeakable for a chance to complete a mission, only to be drawn in by the enemy. 5. Coming full circle, she compromises the mission for the hope of love and safety, throwing away life and the respect of friends in one fell moment.*********Spoilers end**************The failures of Wang Jiazhi pursuits are shocking to point of comedy at times, just as one might gasp and laugh coldly in near disbelief at extreme tragedy and carnage. However, Wang Jiazhi's story is one that would only be all too common in that day and age.While the NC-17++ scenes do contribute to the raw and poignant artistry of the the movie, the storyline and acting is enrapturing in and of itself. The sophisticated and empathic audience is sure to find this film a winner that will haunt their thoughts long after more foolish viewers have lost interest.","Lust, Caution"
126,DrSatisfaction,"Drawn out, borderline pornographic, but...",8,8 September 2007,"...well worth seeing. I had the pleasure of seeing this film tonight at the Toronto International Film Festival and it was a delightful experience (not to mention I was about a foot away from Tony Leung and Ang Lee).So as I have written in the title, the film itself may appear to be a bit flawed to most viewers. One of the consensus main complaints was that it was too long and drawn out (157 minutes is no joke, especially with a few ice teas in you from dinner). However, I believe the story was well paced and needed the full length of the movie to fully develop. There were not many scenes that could have been easily cut out. It was also not nearly as slow as some other films (i.e. In the Mood for Love) or as long as other films (i.e. Once Upon a Time in America). Overall, I felt the movie flowed quite naturally and was focused on the storyline, although I went into the movie expecting a loose meandering plot line (as some other reviews have suggested).Another complaint was that the sex scenes were unnecessarily long, prolific, graphic, and even violent (there was a rape scene). Again, I disagree with these complaints because I felt like these were the scenes that really brought out the lust in the characters. This was especially true for Tony Leung's character, whom many viewers seemed to feel was underdeveloped and one dimensional. As my friend said, ""Tony could have done this role in his sleep."" True, but that was the whole point of his character. Ang Lee purposely left his character undeveloped for most parts of the movie except those few sex scenes, a particular scene in a Japanese whore house, and the closing scene. Those were the few scenes that made Leung's character vulnerable and human. Because there were so few windows that allowed the audience to glimpse into his character, that made the emotions all the more realistic and powerful. The violence in the rape scene should also be addressed. Again, this was one of those rare scenes that shows Leung's character as human (although it was a very brutal, violent side of him). Here, he appeared angry and frustrated, and not at Tang Wei's character but really more at himself and what he has turned into. He was portrayed as a traitor in the movie, and he never spoke about how he viewed himself except for the scene in the Japanese brothel, when Tang's character asked him if he took her there so she could be his whore. He responded that he took her there because he knew much more about whoring oneself than she did, obviously referring to his political role as a traitor. Thus, through minimal dialogue and character development, Ang Lee was able to depict Leung's character with great insight and accuracy, all the while reminding us that he was still human on some level.Now although Leung's character development was sacrificed for the benefit of the film, Tang's character development was actually enhanced. Make no mistake, she was the central character of the movie, and it was very interesting to follow her metamorphosis from a young, naive university student to a spy for the resistance force in bed with the enemy. Once again, Lee revisits his theme of lust and how powerful it can be during her character development and especially the sex scenes. There was a scene after she finished having sex with Leung and goes to report to her superior officers. She then describes to them how she must endure and pretend to love Leung wholeheartedly as a part of her role, and how she endures the prolonged sessions of sex only to hope for them to crash in the door and shoot Leung in the back of the head to have his brains and blood splattered all over her body. All in all, it was a very notable and powerful acting job on Ms. Tang's behalf and definitely refreshing to see a younger actress take on a serious role like this and really tackling it.There were also some lighthearted moments sprinkled throughout the film, which had an excellent score to accompany it. The cinematography, costumes, scenery, etc. were all first rate. The real meat of the film, however, was within Ang Lee's direction, Tang's acting, and of course, the intense sex scenes that powerfully depicted lust, no holds barred, with anger, frustration, hate, and all the other negative emotions associated with it. Interestingly enough, the only moment in the movie where both Leung and Tang's characters felt a mutual love was not in bed, but in the Japanese brothel when Tang performed a song for Leung.All in all this was a delicate and exquisite movie that was carefully planned and filmed, with attention to every detail. It offers a profound and in depth examination of lust. I recommend that everyone should experience the movie once, regardless of the 2.5 hours length and explicit sex scenes - it was well worth the time.","Lust, Caution"
127,curry-b-taylor,"Great Drama, Strange Rating Choice",9,23 May 2019,"This is a well-acted, intriguing historical fiction set during a political upheaval in 20th century China. A long and captivating tale of espionage and betrayal. The most curious part of this movie, though, is the choice to rate it NC-17. Considering the fact that the sex scenes are few and heavily censored, and the violence is no different than what you'll see on nighttime broadcast television these days, I don't even think the movie should have an R rating. PG-13 would be appropriate. The lower rating may cause many to miss out on a very immersive and entertaining historical piece.","Lust, Caution"
128,osuhaha,"Thank you, Ang Lee and the whole crew!",10,20 October 2007,"I watched the film twice and was riveted by every minute of it. I am convinced that Ang Lee is one of the greatest directors of our time. Thank you, Ang Lee and the whole crew, for contributing another masterpiece to Chinese-language film and world cinema; for the unprecedented representation of people's struggles for survival in wartime China with such depth, subtlety, elegance, and precision; for bringing alive Wang Chia Chi and Mr. Yee--and also Kuang Yu Ming and others; for providing an alternative perspective to love, life, war, nation, patriotism, loyalty, drama, politics, and morality; for bringing body heat, blood, flesh, and tears to Eileen Chang's cold and cynic short story; for rescuing individual complexities from the grand narrative of nation, politics, and morality! And for those who debate whether it is a love story, I would say that if your definition of love is bounded by morally acceptable caring relationship, then it is not; but if you have more sympathy for people who are attracted someone against their will, then it is a love story in essence! To me, Mr. Yee is someone who lives in darkness but desperately yearns for light and Chia Chi, who still retains her naivety in that turmoil and twisted time, is the only hope for light and trust in his twisted life. The scene when he comes home to stop Chia Chi from leaving for Hong Kong (while she is still performing her role of seducer) already reveals his strong feelings for her. Chia Chi, on the other hand, starting from feeling sympathetic for him, also finds the love and care that she calls for but gets no response in her own family, Kuang Yuming, and ""comrades"". Unfortunately, both of them are just screws of the ruthless state (no matter which one it is) machines beyond their control...","Lust, Caution"
129,Prince Aquarius,Mahjong in Lust Caution,10,3 October 2007,"I read someone making an assumption that the ladies in mahjong games offer sex to Mr Yee in return for his favors and are jealous of Wang Chia Chi.I disagree.I like the meaningful tension Ang Lee built up over the mahjong table. I have known how to play mahjong since my youth, though not an expert, and watched my families and friends play, so I totally understand how gossips and personalities swish like swordsmen (or swordswomen) exchanging moves during the games.The ladies in the movie, in my view, are just prying and suspicious like typical Chinese women playing mahjong. Yes, they have to exchange favors. But sex, no way. They have their own husbands, and they care about the husbands' officialdom. So what favors can those ladies give? Exchange information about the war and trade, and keep Mrs Yee busy are good enough.The ladies are not jealous of Wang. They simply want to detect what's going on so they can protect their husbands and the life they lead. In war time, any information would be valuable not just for the agents but for common people too. All have to survive.Even though the ladies know Wang is Mr Yee's mistress, they would still play mahjong happily with Mrs Yee and say nothing about it.A lot of things are going on in the mahjong games. If western audience couldn't get it, the possible similarity they can imagine would be like gentlemen playing golf while making deals. Maybe someday Hollywood could make some films about the politics of golf games. But as a Chinese, I still think mahjong game is culturally and politically more interesting.Mahjong scenes are boring? Not at all, not in Lust Caution.","Lust, Caution"

Frankly, as the story unfolded little by little, I couldn't help but simply wait to be led into the inner world of the characters. Such suppressed but strong emotion stuck me that I couldn't breathe at some point, fixing my eyes on the screen and forgetting myself.This movie is definitely a masterpiece. The storytelling, the music, the actor/actress, and those erotic scenes, which are totally indispensable to the whole story, are all beyond expectations! I always wonder what a kind of person Lee must be to get such deep rooted emotions and feelings out of men and women, and present them in front of the audience in such a strikingly artistic but nevertheless authentic way.I watched the movie yesterday, and I couldn't help but repeat the story in my head again and again. I am not yet ready to give a full perspective of the movie. I guess I can only do so after I myself get out of the story.","Lust, Caution"

The plot is rather simple and develops with a rigorous, slow pace, with an obsessive attention to details. The director manages in creating a dark, oppressive atmosphere; ""a scary place"", ""like hell"", as he has described the movie. The power of lust is investigated: lust is used to lure a man into a dangerous trap, lust also offers a glimpse of ecstasy to characters caught in a world of violence and fear, lust/love brings people to death. Though not reaching the sublimity of Brokeback Mountain this movie leaves the viewer with a long-lasting impression. Great, intriguing performance of the newcomer actress Tang Wei.","Lust, Caution"

133,bonjour824,Ang Lee is a real genius !!,9,28 September 2007,"After watching the preview of ""Se--Jie"", I was so shocked and felt really really awful !! Being Mr. Yee and Wang Jiazhi are so hard. Every scenes are so important and memorable and they can't stop appearing in my mind ! Tony and Wai Tang are really great and they could bring you into the movie. Both of them are poor and pathetic : Jiazhi was only 23 years old but she suffered such a miserable life that no one can imagine, she fell in love with a person that she shouldn't love. Mr. Yee was portraited as a cold-blooded person and he, in fact, is a true human with love. He had to keep himself alive so he helped the Japanese. I am sure he didn't want to (He hated Japanese actually)!! He loved Jiazhi and bought her a ring as a commitment but soon discovered that his true love is a spy.All characters in this movie were so selfish, including those who called themselves as patriots. They all have some kinds of intentions like making revenges. I really hate that guy who burnt Jiazhi's letter, he is a LIAR !!Jiazhi devoted herself into the love of Mr. Yee that she chose Yee rather than her first love and let Yee ended her life (she could have taken her pill). I don't know if her purpose for letting Yee killed herself is making revenge or putting a tattoo of love in Yee. She had the chance to kill Yee while having sex with him but she didn't and she refused to kiss her first love, Kuang. She might not realise her love to Yee but she knew it when receiving the ring from Yee whose eyes are full of love.Yee was a lonely and insecure guy that he hardly could find someone to talk to and finally he found one but the wrong one......Love is so terrible that it makes people doing things that are unpredictable......The movie was great but not perfect : Ang failed to convey the anger of being occupied by the Japanese - He tried to emphasize it but not strong enough. Also, the last scene of Mr. Yee escaped from the jewellery shop was so hilarious and was ruining the mood of the movie. (Maybe Ang intended to do it to tease at those people who cared about the lives and did stupid and foolish things) Ang is a genius in presenting the emotion and feeling of people. His new movie was not that disppointing as the media said. The media was so superficial to focus only on the sex scenes which were not as violent as it reported. The three sex scenes were not weird and I could truly experience the emotional change of Yee and Jiazhi thru them.I've watched almost all movies of Tony Leung - he is my five-star actor. Wei Tang is a talented actress and I really hope she would be more famous in the international stage.","Lust, Caution"

135,tennisaquarius,A Lust Caution intercourse I enjoy,10,24 September 2007,"I went to Vieshow around 7:30pm and saw the schedule of Lust Caution was lighting in red all the way to midnight. It meant full house the whole night. It's kind of rare in my memory. Only summer blockbusters could have this strong performance, yet their ratings were not restricted! I didn't worry about my ticket. I already ordered on-line. Ang Lee, do make yourself at home. We all love you. And I love the sex scenes. On bed, they use their body languages to show their emotions. Lust and caution are the basic tones, the skin, and what hidden beneath are hatred, anger, revenge, loneliness, redemption, and love. I have never seen so many emotions in scenes of sexual intercourse or lovemaking, whatever you call them. I felt tense during the sex scenes which are indispensable for the whole dramatic arc. I didn't enjoy the lust part, and the caution undercurrent had my heart dangling. If I want to enjoy sex on movie, I would just go to watch porn. People who want to go for that very reason, be prepared to get disappointed. I was also moved by those young patriotic students. By them, Ang Lee tells us he was once like them, and still is now, sending message to the audience through art, through culture, and with passion. Ang Lee seems like to make movie with a lot of metaphors. You can see that judging from the movie titles. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not only an idiom, but also meant for the characters and more; Brokeback Mountain is a lost paradise as well; and Lust Caution, for that foreign audience would miss it again, by its Chinese title 色戒 we realize 戒 is also a pun. 戒 is Caution and the diamond ring Mr. Yee gives to Wang too. The diamond ring, when the secretary returns back and says, ""it's yours."" ""No,"" Mr. Yee says, ""it's not mine."" I guess it means the diamond ring belongs to Wang. So does his love to her. For the first time, I didn't feel a diamond ring is so superficial like in the TV commercials.From some reviews and news, I noticed Ang Lee and the crew changed Eileen Chang's assassination scene? If so, that is really smart. Anyway, I am going to read Eileen Chang's short story. I am always interested in comparing his films and the original stories or movie scripts. No exception. It's kind of Lust Caution intercourse I enjoy between Ang Lee and me.","Lust, Caution"
136,sherwinliu,Has elevated mahjong scenes to a whole new level.,9,15 October 2007,"One of the finest Chinese movies in recent memory, and some of the best acting by mandarin-speaking actors I have seen. Ang Lee's beautifully filmed ""Lust, Caution"" has now become infamously associated with its raw eroticism, but it is a treatise on the subtleties of human interaction and morality, and it is deeply ingrained and understanding of the Chinese culture. Although dramatic emotions don't often surface during its 157 minutes, when they do they are like spurts of supernova events that immediately capture your attention.The story is on the cautious side on the subject of politics - the suffering during the Japanese occupation is viewed from a distance. The themes it focuses on make ""Lust, Caution"" easier to compare to another recent spy thriller with a very similar story: Paul Verhoeven's ""Black Book"". The difference in approach couldn't be more startling, and while both movies have its merits, we see manifestations of the same questions of loyalty and patriotism which occur during resistance to foreign occupation.The impeccable cinematography and the atmosphere is immersive. I was happily lost in it for the duration of the movie. The soundtrack was not particularly fetching to me as, let's say, ""The Last Emperor""'s was. But the attention to details in the historical settings, the costumes, and also the actor's demeanor and pronunciation of mandarin were all perfectly convincing for me - not that I am an expert on any of that, of course.","Lust, Caution"
137,anthony-597,A spy/thriller/love film set in late pre war Hong Kong and occupied Shanghai,9,30 September 2007,Gripping story. This is a spy thriller set in immediately pre-war Hong Kong and occupied Shanghai. At the same time it is a poignant tale of human emotions. It portrays the human feelings and develops the relations between the characters in a way that combines the espionage/ thriller with the love story. Wei Tang is excellent in her role and Tony Leung never misses. He could have killed himself at the end. The love scenes might be at the most extreme for legitimate films but they do fit naturally into the picture. The historical scenes were very well recreated except it was a bit confusing to see a 1960's London taxi in pre-war Hong Kong.,"Lust, Caution"
138,woodstck-1,"Boring story, but wonderful actor (not actress)",5,14 November 2007,"I don't understand why people are so much favorable to this movie. I'm an Asian and I'm a little bit bored with this kind of plot (resistance group to Japan, female spy falling in love with traitor...). Maybe this kind of story is unique to Western people. From my understanding, what Ang Lee added to this stereotype story is just a nice music and porn-like scenes by exploiting a young actress to be famous. She looked so trivial besides Tony Leung Chiu Wai. However, Tony acts perfectly (as always) and he deserves all the praises. Without him, this movie would be a shame for Ang Lee. I saw this movie this afternoon at the theater near my school and there were around 10 people including us. After the movie ends, there were only five remaining (I think that this movie needs more tension - especially the former half). Please don't say that I am a stupid fun-seeking watcher. About love (at least), I think Kar Wai Wong is much better.","Lust, Caution"
139,lcview,My view,9,28 September 2007,"Many people already wrote the plots of ""Lust, Caution"". I don't repeat again, I just have a few words here...I have read many reviews from the professional film critics. Some are extremely insulting, and those people didn't understand the film at all. I felt sorry for Ang Lee and all people who worked hard for the film.""Lust, Caution"" is a pure Chinese drama with the bloody China-Japan war and the Chinese cultural context of 1940s: slow pace, old Shanghai, mahjong, the traditional song, hatred, love, loneliness, and the souls of students and traitors.Do not forget the cultural differences: Western people play the card games; Chinese people play the mahjong games. I don't know either, I always see the body languages of the players.I personally dislike the raw sexual scenes, however, the film is still a masterpiece!","Lust, Caution"
140,nononsense92,Snoozer,1,9 October 2007,"Acting, sets, makeup and hair are stunning, but the pacing of the film is trying. Clocking in at nearly 3 hours (a true irony since the film is based on a short story), the film asks viewers to hang in there when there's no plot payoff. It left many profoundly disappointed, wanting and with many more unanswered questions than going in. When a film leaves the viewer thinking he should read the book/novella instead to clarify vast swaths of storyline, but isn't even sure that, based on the film, the book would be any more illuminating, the viewing experience is greatly shortchanged.The gossipy mahjong club could have been better used to provide a socio-historical context for international audiences whose knowledge of conditions and circumstances of the period they might be forgiven for not being familiar with in great detail. Such benevolent dialogue would go a certain distance to help the viewer make simple connections to the context, characters, environment, plot or heroine. The superfluous, voyeuristic, and painfully protracted bedroom scenes do nothing to advance the story. Unexplained delays in the heroine's resistance group to deal with their stated objective are equally frustrating. Those elements combined felt almost like backhanded reproaches to viewers for a lack of knowledge, trying their patience and reasoning, leaving one to wonder how it's possible to get browbeaten into boredom for three hours. No one angle of attempted engagement--romantic, political, historical, skin, plot, narrative--is ever fully developed, lacking a commitment to focus which resulted in at least two known viewers feeling totally exasperated post-viewing.It's an elegantly staged, failed Shakespearean tragedy. But if a viewer tries answering any of the many, many questions he's left asking all throughout and at the end, she'll simply come up short; the film accomplishing perhaps the biggest anti-tour de force of delivering the least possible payoff in the longest three hours of cinematic tedium.","Lust, Caution"

If you get a chance to see it, don't. Save your money. This movie should also be rated ""X"".While the theory of the movie is good, the actors tried their best, the direction was poor. The script should had gone back to the bottom of the bird cage.Several times, camera movement left you wondering what was happening. The color was okay, no special effects to enhance the scenes, several mistakes could be seen where a prop was not quite finished or ready, especially when sitting in front of the prison, and again several shots in the house.Should there be any award for this film, only a ""Razzy"".","Lust, Caution"
142,janiefeng,nice movie and nice music,10,10 December 2007,"I think it is a very good movie, I felt sad and pity on wang jiazhi. The quality of the screen and the music are very good. Even after several weeks, the main theme and the scene still in my mind, I have to google the OST for it.Western people can't understand it well, because they don't have the background, neither the history of that period nor the novel and novelist--Zhang ailing.The scene is very realistic, it made me felt the Shanghai was really like that during that time.It is very complex feeling, not just a simple sadness or hatred.","Lust, Caution"
143,lcbetty2002,A believable romantic story,8,21 October 2007,"I saw the film yesterday with my boyfriend and totally enjoyed it throughout the two and half hours.As always, Ang Lee is a superb storyteller. Even though the subject is not new in Hollywood (a romantic thriller in a war background), Ang Lee was able to build the plot and characters in a very believable way with plenty of twists and details that keep the audience absorbed. What started out as a group of students' patriotic attempt to kill a bad guy in a short summer gradually spinned out of control and took them to a 3-year journey full of blood and ended with death. The turning point was the killing of Tsao - Mr. Yee's underling who threatened to tell on them. It was the most raw and messy killing I've ever seen - Kuang took the first stab with trembling hands, but the guy wouldn't die. He stood up and began to walk toward the door. Everybody was terrified, but they had no choice. A second student ran up and gave another stab. The guy fell, blood flowing everywhere. Yet he stood up again and continued to move. Then came the third and fourth stab... until every student had blood on their hands. In that seemingly forever scene, the guy's eyes kept wide open as if he still believed he had a chance to live...Tony played a very convincing character of Mr. Yee, from his first appearance emerging from the darkness of the secret police headquarter. Ang Lee didn't bother to show him performing a torture. In fact Mr. Yee was a man of few words and kept his face expressionless most of the time. However, if you look at his eyes, there is no mistake how evil and dangerous this man is. It's amazing how an actor can create such a powerful presence so subtly. Then as his relationship with Zhijia evolved, his other emotions were released  the fear, desperation and self-hatred in his eyes became more and more apparent each time he made love with Jiazhi. A couple of times he even showed some soft feelings toward the woman. Toward the end of the movie he had the first sincere smile when Jizhia put on the diamond ring he gave her. Unfortunately that was the anti-climax of the story, as he immediately found out that he was betrayed and returned to his old role as a merciless executor. I like the ending. Instead of the Hollywood rule of a final twist of luck (i.e. the princess got rescued), Mr. Yee let Zhijia and her group die immediately. It just befits his character and there could be no other way of telling the story in a realistic manner.Zhijia's character is probably more complex in the way that it has evolved a lot over the years. She began as a simple, sweet school girl with a talent for drama. Then she stepped into Mrs. Mak's role. To accomplish the mission of assassination, she had to befriend Mrs. Yee, then seduce Mr. Yee and finally became his mistress. Each time she was forced to step up her performance. She portrayed a brave, calm, smart and seductive woman. Had it not being for the ending, I would be convinced that she was born to be an agent. Unfortunately, what happened to her proved how true it is that women are prone to be slave of emotions. She agreed to participate in the action largely under the charm of Kuang, a fellow young man full of passion. Three years later, as her relationship with Mr. Yee deepened, she admitted she got confused as Mrs. Mak, a woman falling in love, rather than an agent with a mission. She was breaking down as she succumbed to a powerful man both sexually and psychologically. In the final moment, she chose to save the life of the man she loved, despite the morality call and the unavoidable ending of herself and her fellow agents.","Lust, Caution"
144,sunny_sun_8,a great movie,10,23 October 2007,"I read lots of reviews about this movie, and lots in English, but much more in Chinese. Lust, Caution has overwhelmed the Chinese movies reviews, and most of the comments give very high credit to the director and the actors, a few complained about there has too less politics in the story. Ang Lee is a great director, and all of the crew did a great job for this movie. One thing reflected from this movie is that here has lots of Americans trusted Ang Lee, and gave decent credit to the movie, which is very impressive, because America people obviously are open minded, and would like to see different cultures, and also appreciate movies from different culture. as another reflect from China, all Chinese from different areas, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland china are very much touched or expected ""Lust, Caution"". by the way, Chinese are very disappointed that Academy rejected this movie represent Taiwan for the ""foreign movie"", which is definitely awful for every Chinese people, i believe.","Lust, Caution"
145,cmann-13,Daughter's Longing,10,2 December 2007,"I hate how this movie is being marketed in the US: ""thriller,"" ""erotic,"" etc. It is terribly misleading and has surely resulted in disappointed viewers.I was dreading seeing this movie due to the pre-publicity about the explicit sexual content. I really was not up to watching some old guy's sex fantasies. But I love Tony Leung and Leehom Wang and had respect for other Ang Lee work, so I set my jaw and went. I was overwhelmingly glad I did.The sex is explicit but strangely un-erotic. Both of the main characters (Mr. Yee and Jiazhi) are so clearly desperate to fill some cold, aching chasm; both fail miserably.The pace of the movie is contemplative--not what I would call ""thrilling."" But I agree with others, the 150 minutes flew by. I soaked up every scene and can't imagine which one I could have done without (however, I don't feel my new found intimate knowledge of Tony's body parts was really necessary...).However, what has stayed with me is the under-story of a daughter hurting from the loss of her father's love. Everything Wang Jiazhi does she does in an effort to fill that emptiness, in some unconscious effort to be worthy of her father's love. Yet it all ends up just leaving her more at a loss. Yes, she earns Kuang Yu Min's respect and he finally makes his move (too little, too late for her--the pit is too big by then). Yes, she is able to seduce Mr. Yee and she finds satisfaction in that; she can't help but feel victorious at ""winning"" this older man's affection. She throws everything out the window to protect him; he does nothing to reciprocate...Ultimately, nothing makes up for the primal loss of paternal love and when it eventually costs her everything, she is too broken to protest.Mr. Yee deals with his own loss and emptiness. Tony Leung is such a superb actor that you end up knowing so much more about his character than would be possible with a lesser talent. Mr. Yee is the worst of the worst: a traitor, a torturer, a rapist, a killer! Yet, somehow you feel he has tumbled into his fate and suffers for it, all the while accepting the consequences. He has buried his humanity so that he can survive in his current circumstance. I felt the brutality of the first sexual encounter with Jiazhi was his anger at her for bringing that humanity to the surface again. Unlike Jiazhi, though, he is able to bury it again--he is a survivor, while she gives up everything for the love she so desperately wants. Who is the strongest? Both of these roles were so complex and acted with such depth. They give the viewer much to mull over. I so appreciated Ang Lee's subtle story telling. The details were explicit, but like so much of life, the meaning was layered and thoughtful.Finally, I suppose any number of young actors could have been substituted for Leehom Wang, but I was thrilled to see him on the screen. I'm a big fan of his music and was apprehensive about his making the almost obligatory move to acting. He was very good, though: understated, believably innocent, a little bit of eye-candy.My advice: believe none of this movie's marketing. Trust your appreciation for Ang Lee and go see this movie with an open mind, ready for a heartfelt story, expertly told.","Lust, Caution"
146,disco_barrio,Poignant depiction of turbulent wartime politics,10,8 October 2007,"I had been hyping myself up a great deal for Lust, Caution ever since I first heard of the project, so I'm glad to say that it did not disappoint. The film was a beautifully executed ""espionage thriller,"" if you want to go with how it's being marketed to a broad audience. Steeped in the historically and culturally turbulent period of the second Sino-Japanese War, one must applaud Ang Lee for the dizzying array of minutiae he oversaw as director.Because of the nature of the film's protagonist Wang Jiazhi (played by a newcomer named Tang Wei - not shabby for your first feature) as an agent working under a second identity to ensnare a dangerous collaborationist (Tony Leung), all the scenes where Wang masquerades as the bourgeois Ms. Mai are fraught with a psychological tension, doubling with the political agenda at stake as well as her womanhood. She portrays both roles with heartbreaking deftness; a great casting choice if there ever was one. While not as physically alluring as some of her competitors for the role - Chinese language actresses including Zhou Xun and Shu Qi - I don't think anyone else could have pulled it off like Tang. She convincingly transforms herself from a naive college girl to coy seductress...and back again.The film struck quite a few personal nerves on my part too. While mainstream cinema should be, you know, self-sustaining or whatever you want to call it, there's really a lot to this movie that gets lost in subtitling to an extent, but also just in context and culture. Etiquette at the mah-jongg table; the omnipresent yet understated background of wartime occupation; political interests in the Chinese Civil War era; the weight of regional identity in dialects and interpersonal relationships. Tang Wei spoke Mandarin, Cantonese, and Shanghainese. My only thought is: What a hottie.The sex scenes are...something else. As echoed by most critics, they serve the story perfectly in capturing the urgency that Tang and Leung have in their precarious affair. There's a lot of violence in them, and it is through these carnal and savage acts that Tony Leung's Mr. Yee character is established as a very dangerous man. I won't spoil too much but there were several times when it became too difficult to watch.There were quite a few moments that made my heart flutter and eyes wobble. I'll just leave it at that.","Lust, Caution"
147,sebastian-pupillo-1,Great film in cinema history and for today's world !,10,11 January 2008,"I saw this film last night so I am probably still in too excitable a state. My excitement is not due to the very sexy scenes in this movie either. I think this is one of the great movies in the history of world cinema. Big statement I know. The film is not derivative but has issues, themes and story lines from some of the great films of the past. What comes to mind are Jean Pierre Melville L'Armee des Ombres, Bertolucci's The Conformist and Last Tango in Paris,Calvancanti's Night Porter and the pessimistic romanticism of Max Ophuls films.Regards Ang Lee's other films, I confess I fell asleep during Brokeback Mountain and when awake found the psychology in the film soap operatic and trite. Crouching Tiger is a great film in the genre,though the fanatic fans of this genre think it boring.The Ice Storm I respected but don't think the images were fully realized, they lacked real resonance and meaning for me. But Lust Caution, you banged the nail on the head Mr Lee. You are a brave filmmaker too, I'm impressed on how you showed ""lust"" and to finish with the shot of bed sheet was really courageous. Your film is about real love of course.Tang Wei gives one of the greatest debut movie performances I have ever seen. She is a heroine screen legend already. Not much needs to be said about the already great Tony Leung.I have calmed down :-) Still great movie. Read a bit on the web now about it. Great interviews with Ang Lee,James Schamus (producer)and Tang Wei seems a pretty switced on gal. What surprised me reading many viewer comments, a major point is missed. Some have pointed out that the film could be set in WWII France or Germany. Well nobody has pointed out that it could just as well have been set in today;'s Iraq or Afghanistan ! Cmon, movies are great and can be art, which this one may be, but get out of the reel world and get active in the real one ! Lot of Chia Chis in the world getting killed everyday in the Middle East and elsewhere.On Chia Chi's decision at the end of the film. Let's face it,they would all have been shot in the end anyway,even if she hadnt followed her heart and her discovered real self. It would only have meant Yee would have been dead also, and replaced by another stoolie. Though I reckon he is a dead man anyway because he now has one hell of a extra skeleton in his closet as well as that of being a collaborator.","Lust, Caution"

Li An as an Oscar director, this movie is far below standard and not up to my expectations.It is a story adapted from Eileen Chang for a plot of murder during the World War II years from 1942..1944 in both cities: Hong Kong and Shanghai. Poor shooting in the Hong Kong part for without staging any war scenes during that time.In China people is only talking about the cut sex scenes.

149,badgerdog7,lust caution: besotted betrayal,7,20 July 2008,"I read a reviewer who said this film was neither thrilling nor sexy. I disagree. 1. It is a remarkable piece of Chinese film noir with all of the attendant censorship and governmental intrusion which typifies how that government rates and supports such films. Regardless of how famous a director is, it is still a laborious exercise in lavishly fawning over and entertaining bureaucrats 2. I have many nc-17 rated films which I buy because of the hype and controversy yet I did not focus solely on the sexual themes as I did on why the mistress/assassin reveled in the relationship and, secondly, why the mistress/assassin symptomatically betrayed the resistance at the slip of a lavish piece of ice.I think that the agent provocateur stayed because she needed to. She was a sponge to a handsome, mercurial official who exhibited confidence, certainty, vulnerability. These qualities are powerful to women. She also continued because her involvement became pivotal to the success of the operation and I believe that she enjoyed her status within the ""cell."" The way that they hung on her every word. Perhaps, too, she secretly enjoyed the position of privilege in a city which was rife with poverty, struggle, destitution. He stayed because she represented a simpler, bygone era of women who did not question but complied. She was for him the ideal woman coquettish, sublime, and indifferent to his "" business."" Her betrayal is symptomatic of all people inferring that everyone has a price. Her price was the rock although she knew that in doing so would risk the lives of her compatriots. It is, I say, symptomatic because it seems that women become weak at the sight of jewelry.As for the sexual encounters I understand why it was necessary. Both principals have terrifyingly dangerous jobs. She, avoiding exposure. He, separating his domestic civility with the incongruous terror of killing. Therein lies the tension. He for collaborating and reviling his duties and she for desiring the encounters and fulfilling her patriotic duty. The sexual intimacies were a way to vent pent-up, primal energies as both principals were involved in savage and indifferent occupations. In the same way that the well-to-do go to be dominated at niche clubs for a fee.I did not like the chronological disruptions also.I also felt that Ang Lee selected the right actress. She is adorable in the fedoras and flapper-esquire hats and period dresses. With the short bobbed hair and the cherubic, youthful appeal I felt that she fit seamlessly.It is the sex that retails the movie but it is the story which frames it.","Lust, Caution"

I especially appreciated the comments from the Asian reviewers since it was clearly not made for US audiences (unlike ""Dragon"").Anyway, I was so gripped by the dynamics of this film that I couldn't believe that 2 1/2 hours had elapsed since the beginning of the film.I was particularly surprised by the sex scenes (which I didn't know about before I saw the film) which I barely experienced as erotic let alone pornographic. There was so much dramatic/emotional content to this footage that it dominated the images.","Lust, Caution"

152,takeshi_otaku_boy,EXCELLENT story with EXCEPTIONAL characters,10,5 November 2007,"One of the most important directors of recent history has been Ang Lee. He marveled us with films such as ""The Ice Storm,"" "" Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,"" and ""Brokeback Mountain."" Now, he takes upon a short story revolving around a beautiful young woman and a notorious dominant figure named Mr. Yee. Set in Japanese occupied Shanghai during the 1930's, and filmed by the talented Rodrigo Prieto, Ang Lee manages to organize characters' goals, and get us, the audience, into supporting Wang Jiazhi (Tang Wei) as she ventures into a life of ""Lust"" and ""Caution."" Mentioning Tang Wei's performance, I cannot even begin to believe how this is her first feature film. This performance will certainly be remembered in her future career. Mr. Yee, played by the legendary Tony Leung, is portrayed mysterious, savvy, and all dangerously dominant. Also, worthy of a nod, was Wang Lee Hom as Kuang Yu Min, a young man passionate for any participation to the resistance.If you appreciate a well told story about espionage, passion, love, and lust, this is the film for you. Ang Lee remains not a Taiwanese filmmaker, but a ""Cinemaker"" capable of telling a fantastic story with the medium known as film.","Lust, Caution"

I have watched this movie countless times and have never gone tired of yet. Tei Wang, is one of the reasons i keep watching it too. I would like to see more movies during this period. The Japanese Occupation of China has been overlooked in both history books and in the cinema. Last year the release of Nanking and the book by Iris Chang ""The Rape of Nanking"" bring this dark period of history to light. This movie also helps","Lust, Caution"
154,paula_nocon,This is essentially an Asian Film,9,22 September 2007,"I resent that this movie is marketed as an ""espionage thriller"", or that it's a thematic follow- up to Brokeback Mountain, or that it got an R rating for its graphic sex scenes. It is much more than that. It is a film set in Asia, by an Asian filmmaker, with a special resonance for Asian moviegoers.I think this is a very personal film for Ang Lee - betraying his private thoughts on his homeland, on sexuality, on truth, on love.Here in Asia, one shared event in our history binds us all - the Japanese occupation during WWII and all the horrors that came with it.To retell the anguish of that time through a torrid affair between a collaborator (traitor) and a spy is a brave commentary on how we Asians respond to traumas both personal and collective. Mr Lee raises unearths some complex emotions towards identity and truth, as revealed in only the most intimate moments between illicit lovers in times of extreme duress.That Lee chose to make such a film after his phenomenal success in Hollywood, and during this period of phenomenal progress for modern China, gives Lust Caution a heightened sense of relevance and urgency, a film that can potentially invite questions on what it deeply means to be Chinese, to be Asian.Lee is a master, Tony Leung is divine, Tang Wei is a slow-burning revelation. I highly recommend this film to Asians and non-Asians alike.","Lust, Caution"
155,hellokv,Masterpiece from Ang Lee,10,10 July 2018,"Another great movie from Ang Lee. He is always good at telling stories especially with his rhythms and movie language. This is a very complicated topic in China with so many backgrounds and relationships to explain, and each people has their own character and development. But Ang Lee has do a great job. It maybe a little bit hard for young people to understand the performance of each actor, but when you know the background of the war, I'm sure that you will admire the ability of Ang Lee.","Lust, Caution"
