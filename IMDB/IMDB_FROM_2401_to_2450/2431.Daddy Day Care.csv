0,TheLittleSongbird,Not bad,6,3 September 2010,"Daddy Day Care is not absolutely brilliant, but what I liked about it was that it didn't try to be. Admittedly the story is silly and predictable, the script has its weak spots, it can get sickly sweet in places and there are some repetitive sight gags. However, it is nicely filmed, has a good soundtrack, does have some funny moments and there are some decent performances from Eddie Murphy(who sensibly underplays), Jeff Carlin and Anjelica Huston. However it is the kids who steal the show, they are very cute and energetic. Overall, Daddy Day Care isn't that bad, it is lacking in originality but has a good cast and has enough energy to make it watchable. 6/10 Bethany Cox",Daddy Day Care
1,SnoopyStyle,"Controlled Eddie Murphy, funny Jeff Garlin, adorable kids",6,15 June 2014,"Charlie (Eddie Murphy) and Kim Hinton (Regina King) bring Ben to try out for the expensive Chapman Academy. Kim is going back to work. Gwyneth Harridan (Anjelica Huston) is the head mistress. Jenny (Lacey Chabert) is one of the teachers. Charlie and co-worker Phil (Jeff Garlin) both get fired. Charlie pulls Ben out of Chapman. Charlie and Phil turn into Mr Moms. Charlie has an idea to start Daddy Day Care with Phil. As the guys get more successful, Harridan starts to notice and she takes on Daddy Day Care. When they get too many kids, they hire weirdo Marvin (Steve Zahn) who turns out to be good with kids.Seeing Jeff Garlin and Eddie Murphy get hit again and again can be funny or repetitive. It's a bit of both in this case. Eddie Murphy is playing it more reserved than usual. Jeff Garlin is funny. The kids are all rambunctious and cute. Some will notice a young Elle Fanning. It's not terribly original copying quite a few jokes from Mr Mom. It has a couple of funny moments and a nice film overall.",Daddy Day Care
2,jboothmillard,Daddy Day Care,4,21 May 2008,"Cheaper by the Dozen was out the same year, and this is almost the same type of film. I have given this film the same rating out of 10 as I did for Cheaper (because it isn't brilliant), but I think this is the much better film to watch. Basically two fathers, Charlie Hinton (Eddie Murphy) and his friend (and work pal) Phil (Jeff Garlin) lose their jobs in product development at a large food company, and are forced to become stay-at-home dads. With no jobs in sight, they decide to set up a new day care facility from home, called ""Daddy Day Care"". When the parents have been persuaded to give the male day care runners a chance, it catches on, and the kids that turn up include Crispin (Shane Baumel), Becca (Hailey Noelle Johnson), and The Flash/Tony (Jimmy Bennett), oh, and Charlie's kid Ben (Khamani Griffin) joins in too. The only thing that could stop them continuing this success is the mean Chapman Academy director Miss Harridan (Anjelica Huston). There some good moments with the two dads playing with the kids and keeping them quiet in various ways, and Murphy makes a more fun dad than Steve Martin did, a good family film. Okay!",Daddy Day Care
3,tavm,Eddie Murphy is way too subdued for me in Daddy Day Care though it's harmless enough,3,27 April 2012,"As someone who's watched Eddie Murphy since his television debut on ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1980, I've seen him in many of his movies and I've liked him in most of the ones I've viewed (an exception would be Pluto Nash). So it is that I've now watched him in this family-friendly comedy that was a hit nine years ago. Having been used to seeing him being a wise guy or playing some outrageous characters, I have to admit I'm not used to seeing such a subdued Eddie as he seems here. In fact, he rarely says or does anything remotely funny. I mean, this is very much a cutesy kind of movie meant to amuse parents and provide their kids some relatable characters their age. And if I was an under age 12 one, I'd probably really like this movie. I don't hate it, per se. It's just not something that's my cup of tea, that's all. Still, Daddy Day Care is harmless enough and it's fascinating to see ""SNL"" vet Murphy have scenes with subsequent cast members Kevin Nealon, Siobahn Fallon Hogan, and Laura Kightlinger. And if you want to expose your kid to Murphy without getting embarrassed by some of the material, this is as good a place to start...",Daddy Day Care
4,studioAT,Daddy Day Care,5,16 November 2020,"Like Robin Williams and Steve Martin before him, Eddie Murphy around this time started popping up in these big, broad family comedies.And to be fair, this isn't bad, with a stellar cast (that boasts people like Steve Zahn and Lacey Chabert in support) helping to lift otherwise sitcom-esque material.",Daddy Day Care
5,view_and_review,Eddie and the kids worked out,7,7 March 2007,"I thought Daddy Day Care was a good movie, and I think that Eddie Murphy pulled off the role really well. Outside of Dr. Doolittle and Dr. Doolittle 2, I'm used to seeing Eddie Murphy in roles where he can cut up and be very NON PG. I'm also used to seeing Eddie Murphy take over the show and be the show so to speak, but Daddy Day Care wasn't all about Eddie. The kids had their small but valuable contributions, and the other co-stars added some good flavor to the movie as well. It ended up being a nice family movie that wasn't so over the top with antics to be absurd, and at the same time not being to bogged down with sappy melodrama. Eddie Murphy hit a solid line drive with this one.",Daddy Day Care
6,anaconda-40658,Murphy Daycare.,3,9 June 2015,"Daddy Daycare (2003): Dir: Steve Carr / Cast: Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, Steve Zahn, Anjelica Huston, Regina King: About as much fun as having a group of children line up around the block for an opportunity to kick you in the crotch. It is a nitwit comedy addressing genders elements where males are seen as unfit caregivers. Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin play working fathers who are fired from their job so they decide to start a daycare. This proves difficult when rival daycare owner Anjelica Huston opposes it. Non-existing plot climaxing with Huston getting her just desserts. This is divert when factoring in that the rival daycare is where children are actually learning different languages and developing skills. Murphy's daycare has children running about eating junk food. Directed by Steve Carr who worked with Murphy in the dreary Dr. Dolittle 2. The sets are horrid and the screenplay is complete simplicity. Murphy is likable but the material is flat. Garlin overacts particularly when he runs back and forth yelling holding a dead mouse. Steve Zahn plays a Star Trek obsessed mail carrier who might have worked in a better movie. Huston is belittled as a tyrant daycare facility head. Regina King has the lifeless role as Murphy's wife whose job is to be off screen as much as possible. Gender point argued but film looks so bad that it could have been made by kids. Score: 3 / 10",Daddy Day Care
7,HotToastyRag,My favorite Eddie Murphy movie,10,23 September 2021,"Daddy Day Care might be my favorite Eddie Murphy movie; but then again, I've said that about a lot of his kiddie movies. But I just love this one! No matter how many times I watch it, I laugh myself silly. And I might be the only person in the world who both loves this movie and can't stand children.Why would I love this movie then, you ask? Because it's hilarious. It completely demonstrates every reason why I don't like children. I get to watch Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, and Steve Zahn suffer as they try to control the little monsters, and I don't have to get my hands dirty. And when the movie's over, I get to smile in gratitude that my home will never be trashed by toddlers. Speaking of home, I must digress for a moment: Eddie Murphy's home in this movie is so beautiful! It looks like a cozy colonial B&B on the outside, and the inside boasts of ornate detail. Dark wood wainscotting, a lovely kitchen with dusty green tile, a great staircase, columns, glass French doors leading to the living room, hardwood floors, wall and ceiling details - alright, my digression is over. But I would love to live in that house, as long as I could come home to it after the children have left.In case you missed this one when it came out in the theaters, the premise is pretty irresistible, so start planning your family movie night. Eddie and Jeff are advertising executives, but when their healthy cereal account goes belly-up, they get fired. Left alone with their kids while their wives to go work, they're pretty miserable. Until Eddie comes up with an idea: the exclusive and expensive preschool run by Anjelica Huston is the only game in town, so if he comes up with an alternative, he'll get tons of business. Thus, ""Daddy Day Care"" is born. At first, Eddie and Jeff don't know what they're doing, and it's very funny. Chasing after the children, trying desperately to entertain their short attention spans, and feeding them any sugary treat they demand, they're exhausted by the end of the day. But they're professionals, and they take pride in their work, so as the days go by, they continue to improve the quality of childcare. It's quite touching to see them bond with the kids and grow to care more about them than their paychecks.On a surface level, Daddy Day Care is plainly an enjoyable movie. If you're a parent, you'll totally identify with the grown-ups as to the difficulties of childrearing. Your kids will probably demand you take them to ""Daddy Day Care"" the next morning. It looks like the coolest daycare ever! My mom had a special appreciation for this movie because she used to run a daycare herself. She knew all the rules and regulations one must abide by in setting up a daycare, including the safety gates and the parent-child ratio.From start to finish, this movie has three laughs a minute. It's absolutely delightful, and guaranteed to put you in a good mood, especially if you've had a hard week. There's so much to appreciate in what seems like just a silly kiddie comedy. You can learn about parenting, about what's really important in life, you can laugh at the antics of toddlerhood, or you can just drool over a beautiful home. But there's one more reason to really respect this movie: the amount of patience the actors and crew had to have to work with so many children. There's nothing more difficult than making sure a four-year-old has already eaten, gone to the bathroom, had a drink of water, napped, is in a good mood, and remembers his lines before sticking him in front of a spotlight and say, ""Don't look in the camera, honey."" Not to mention stage mothers. So while it looks like Eddie, Jeff, and Steve are all having one giant playdate with all these little kids, they're actually doing something very difficult. Director Steve Carr and his crew might get dismissed for having an easy assignment of a kiddie movie, but they all had to have patience and deal with the most difficult type of actors in the business. My hat goes off to everyone for making it look so easy.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The last ten seconds of the movie, the camera swirls around in a big aerial circle, and it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""In one of the outtakes during the end credits, you can see Eddie treating the little boy playing his son very nicely. The little boy forgot his line, and Eddie took the fall for it, requesting they do another take. Isn't that sweet? Alright, I think I've talked this movie up enough. It's time you watched it. Or, like me, watched it for the tenth time.",Daddy Day Care
8,FlashCallahan,You broke my Yo-Yo.....,6,11 May 2013,"Two men get laid off in product development at a large food company and are forced to become stay-at-home fathers. They create a new day care facility called ""Daddy Day Care"". As ""Daddy Day Care"" starts to catch on, it launches them into a rivalry with the Chapman Academy tough-as-nails director, Ms. Harridan.....Whatever you think of Eddie Murphy and his later films (the ones without swearing), one cannot deny that they have a slight sincerity about them.Here is another example, if it is an average example. Murphy plays the straight guy with all the best lines and the best house and best kids. The Big guy plays the slapstick Prat- falling guy with a fear of body fluids.And then there's Steve Zahn. An actor who is quite prolific, so at the time it was quite odd him being in this, but he is and he is the useless part of the film. There really wasn't any reason for him to be in this.The film plays out how it should, there's a scene where the Day Care gets threatened with closure, the rival group sabotage something, and Murphy gives it all up to get his old job back, but then something happens that makes him realise the error of his ways.It's not funny, I didn't laugh once, but its nice and inoffensive, and my daughter lapped it up.",Daddy Day Care
9,StevePulaski,How far can one show support and devotion to an actor who doesn't even seem like he's trying?,2,25 July 2012,"Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, and Steve Zahn are actors I only tire of when I see them in atrociously hackneyed material like this. Murphy has an incredible talent for outrageous and vulgar comedies, where his contortionist facial expressions and loquaciousness can sustain an entire movie experience, Garlin is an expert at deadpan humor, which he learned from years of working on Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Zahn can take most any role, even the role of an everyman, and put a fun, creative twist on the character.One can not fault them for Daddy Day Care's failure. It arrives to the viewer like a job applicant arrives to an interview on the worst day of his life. His tie isn't put on correctly, his hair a mess, his voice wheezy and unsophisticated, his clothes not ironed and wrinkled, and his desperation soaring to new heights. On most everything this film tries to accomplish, it's late, meaningless, and flyweight.The story concerns Eddie Murphy's Charlie, a middle-class man working as a product-promoter, I guess you'd say, and has a wife who has just gone back to work as a lawyer after the birth of their son. When Charlie and his co-worker Phil (Jeff Garlin) are laid off and Charlie and his wife can no longer pay the bills for their son, who attends a prestigious preschool, they contemplate ways to earn money and discover that they could open a day care center, boasting the idea that men can do anything women can do and calling it, ""Daddy Day Care."" Of course, this will brew such inspired setups like a ""burp off"" between the band of dysfunctional rugrats, ridiculously over-exaggerated sugar rushes, mindless chatter, recklessness, farting, male incompetence, adults acting like kids, kids acting like intolerable deviants, and so on. Miss Harridan, a teacher of the prestigious preschool, played by the only one who seems to be caring how the picture turns out, Anjelica Huston, notices the men and their newfound success and tries to run them off the map by alerting the village of rules they have broken, abrupt hazards, etc. Frustrated, without options, and overwhelmed with children, they eventually call in the incompetent and socially-awkward Marvin, played by Steve Zahn, who just further adds complete idiocy to the film and its line of events, along with breeding an emotionally vacuous love story.After a good hour of child recklessness and anarchy, the film tries to add a touching, remorseful moral about family, the importance of having fun, while learning, and so on and so forth. This would be welcomed if the film didn't intentionally rely on its silliness and ineptitude to drive itself into a contrived conclusion covered in banality. I'll reiterate by saying I'm a huge fan of Eddie Murphy and his schtick, but Daddy Day Care challenges just are far I'll go to show my support and devotion.Starring: Eddie Murphy, Jeff Garlin, Steve Zahn, and Angelica Houston. Directed by: Steve Carr.",Daddy Day Care
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,Very cute and fun for the family,8,12 October 2005,"I honestly thought that ""Daddy Day Care"" was a very cute movie. I really had my doubts since I don't have my own kids lucky enough, I don't have to watch this. But my mom said to give the movie a shot and to have fun with it. I was plesantly surprised and laughed more than a few times. Yes, it's a cheesy movie and very typical, but you have to learn to have a little fun with it. It reminded me a lot of ""Kindergarten Cop"". You have got to admit that this was a lot better than Eddie Murphy's last film ""The Haunted Mansion"". It's got laughter, drama, and just good old slap stick fun that you or the whole family will enjoy. Just give it a shot.8/10",Daddy Day Care
11,sddavis63,Fun Family Viewing,6,20 June 2009,"Having already seen the disastrous sequel ""Daddy Day Camp"" I thought I owed it to myself to see where that came from. Certainly compared to the sequel, this is a masterpiece. Compared to any other movie I've seen it's a pleasant piece of family fun, amusing at times and rather silly most of the time. Eddie Murphy was well cast, I thought, as Charlie Hinton - a marketing exec who loses his job and opens a day care to make ends meet, while his wife goes out to work. This was certainly a different kind of role for Murphy - very family friendly, and he pulled it off well, as did Jeff Garlin as his partner Phil and Steve Zahn as Marvin. The movie contained a couple of ridiculous caricatures, which always turn me off - especially Angelica Huston as the evil pre-school director Mrs. Harridan and Kevin Nealon as Charlie's old boss Bruce, but in fairness the caricatures here were not as over the top as the pathetic ones in ""Day Camp,"" and this movie thankfully avoided for the most part the toilet humour of the sequel. Unlike many movies that feature children in significant roles, there really wasn't a single one who came across as irritating, and there's even an interesting (and I would say accurate) reflection on reverse sexism, as the initial reaction to the ""Daddy Day Camp"" from parents was that any man who wanted to run a day camp must be - well - not trustworthy. Frankly, I'm surprised this spawned a sequel. It really wasn't that good, but for a movie that you can watch without worrying whether your 5 year old might come into the room while it's on, it's not bad viewing. 6/10",Daddy Day Care
12,Edvis-1997,6,6,9 March 2021,"Decent movie. Had funny scenes, had cute scenes and Eddie Murphy did good job. The main problem is plot, it's a little bit messy and didn't make lot of sense. Could've been great movie.",Daddy Day Care
13,g-bodyl,Good Film!,7,24 February 2008,Daddy Day Care is a better-than-expected film. Critics like Ebert disliked this film as well as the viewers. I saw this movie because I was bored and had nothing else to to do. Eddie Murphy plays a father who just got fired from his job and starts a daycare center with the help of his friend. I actually had a pretty good time watching this film. There were plenty of fine performances by the kids who attended the daycare. Other noticeable actors were Jeff Garlin and Steve Zahn. Zahn was funny as the sci-fi geek and Garlin was great as the the friend of Eddie Murphy. The only thing wrong with this film is that this film is not original. These kind of films are in Hollywood all the time now. Also a few more jokes would not hurt. Overall this film is good. I rate this film a 7/10.,Daddy Day Care
14,lesleyharris30,"Nothing Breathtaking, but Average Family Fun,",7,5 May 2020,"Daddy Day Care is a reasonably good movie with a nicely developed plot and a solid cast. The highlight of the film is without a doubt Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin in the lead roles, they are both clearly having a load of fun on screen together and their chemistry is infectious, making for an enjoyable riot as we watch the duo try to manage a host of manic children.It certainly does not do anything overtly interesting or fresh with its concept, being quite a by the numbers family film, there are moments where you feel like it's about to have a voice, till it immediately shys away from it. Nothing groundbreaking, but enjoyable. While there's nothing to write home about, Daddy Day Care is a solid fun, innocent family adventure that is heightened by Murphy and Garlin's chemistry.
Two best friends start a child caring business, but higher ups will stop at all costs to shut them down.Best Performance: Eddie Murphy",Daddy Day Care
15,CuriosityKilledShawn,Eddie hits a new low.,1,11 May 2004,"To be honest I still had some respect left for Eddie Murphy before this. He just seemed to have lost his way in the 21st century. But nothing will ever make forgive this. He's just went all 'kiddie' in recent years. And it's sick.In the 80's Murphy gave us strong African-American characters like Reggie Hammond, Billy Ray Valentine, Axel Foley and Prince Akeem. But that was a long time ago. And it's a shame to see him trade a hard edge for movies like this.It's so sugary it is literally sickening. It's about as subtle as a brick in the face too. Annoying kids who are obviously reading phonetically off oversized cue-cards held off camera, David Newman's worse than generic 'family movie' score, clockwork predictability and toilet humor (how many more family movies are going to milk fart sounds for all their worth?) are all you can expect from this film.Staring directly into the sun is not as painful on the eyes as this.",Daddy Day Care
16,John6Daniels,Awesome,9,16 February 2021,"Such a fun movie. Its filled with laughs and gaffes.Its about 2 masculine men opening up a daycare business.There is so much fun going on. The children actors did a tremendous job. This Eddie is not a Norbit Eddie or a Harlem Nights Eddie. This was Daddy Eddie. A more chilled, mature Eddie.It had an unattractive grouch lady as a villain. ""She"" did a good job being a villain in a daycare movie.What can be learned?: You Learn that Men can look after children just as women can. People judge people based on stereotypes, sex and experience which is unhealthy. Which is why many people are miserable because they are unable to grow and learn new experiences.Overall a fun movie with so many memorable scenes.Verdict: I've worked in Daycare/Child Care. Let's say Daddy Day care was so much more fun than real life Daycare. Real Life Daycare sucks",Daddy Day Care
17,briancham1994,Not very funny,4,24 August 2020,"I didn't find this film very funny. There are a lot of stressful situations, slapstick, toilet humour and screaming.

18,FiendishDramaturgy,Unenjoyable obvious rip off.,4,24 September 2003,"I love Eddie Murphy. I've been a fan since his stints on Saturday Night Live. But his acting is suffering horribly, as of late. His role choices seem to be suffering as well. While we loved him in Dr. Doolittle and Dr. Doolittle 2, his preoccupation with fatherhood seems to be muddying his professional choices. Perhaps he has his eye on filling Bill Cosby's shoes, one day...but, while I love Eddie Murphy, he's no Bill Cosby. And that's a good thing. He's Eddie Murphy!I don't know if it was the acting, the direction, or WHAT, but this movie just didn't do it for me. While there were funny moments (Siobhan Fallon Hogan as ""Peggy"" was hilarious), the funny moments do not fully redeem this work. I was rather disappointed to see the depths to which Steve Carr would stoop to make us laugh. Potty humor, flatulence and sugar-highs are devices used by uncreative, low-talented individuals who are trying to fit in with real artists. Honestly, there was nothing in this movie that Michael Keaton didn't already do in ""Mr. Mom,"" and Keaton did it much, MUCH better, in my opinion.All in all, while it was enjoyable, I found it to be a sad rip off of a much better film...a real disappointment that not even Anjelica Huston could salvage. Okay, okay, the movie was fun and it did make me laugh, it had some touching moments and was well enacted. But even with all that, the whole time, I couldn't help but think...""What a rip off...it's been done and done and now, it's being done again."" I can't give it more than a 4.5/10 because of the obvious rip off job it's done to ""Mr. Mom.""the Fiend :.",Daddy Day Care

It does that in spades and if you are a parent, you can relate For what is, it is very amusing and actually has heart. Plot: two fathers get fired from an advertising agency. Looking to make ends meet and with no acceptable or affordable daycares nearby, they decide to start their own. How hard can it be!? Cue reckless children humor. Yet they learn and succeed much to the dismay of the expensive, prestigious and strict daycare who begin to lose children to them. Upset, they play dirty. Will Daddy Daycare survive?

20,lukem-52760,NICE FEELGOOD FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT,7,12 February 2020,"The Comic genius Eddie Murphy is great fun here & on top funny form as a struggling family man who he once loses his Job, he opens up a Day Care center for kids within his big posh house & calls it ""Daddy Day Care"" that's the basic simple plot.
Eddie Murphy is a childhood hero of mine as i grew up in the 90's watching pretty much all his films on video & i liked his venture into more light-hearted family friendly films such as the Classic ""Doctor Doolittle"" & the Classic ""The Nutty Professor"" amongst other's & Eddie Murphy done very well at the box office with those hits.
I loved his more mature adult films like his ""48 Hrs"" films or his ""Beverley Hills Cop"" films but because Murphy is such a genuinely funny & cheerful guy on screen he easily brought his old energetic charm & big smile over to a new younger generation & got even more fans!!!
I have recently found my love for again Eddie Murphy films as I've recently re-watched The Nutty Professor, Doctor Doolittle 1&2 & Daddy Day Care & i realised how much I've missed Eddie Murphy & his fun films, i hadn't watched an Eddie Murphy movie in years!!! Now I'm back baby lol & i can't wait to revisit lots of his films i used to watch all the time back in Video.
Daddy Day Care is a nice sweet family film with a Happy tone to it & a really good little cast with Steve Zahn, Angelica Huston, Regina King & Jeff Garlin.
Now the Hollywood legend Angelica Huston has a great fun role here as the sinister head of a strict School who goes against the Daddy Day Care, she has fun in her part as Mrs. Gwyneth Harridan & the always funny Steve Zhan (National Security) is a geeky but nice friend of Murphy's & helps out at Daddy Day Care so there's some good actors here.Eddie Murphy plays struggling & recently fired family man Charlie Hinton, it's a nice easy part for Murphy as he's not as over the top or over crazy here, he just is simply a funny guy who gets into silly situations with the kids & it's all nicely done & feelgood.
There's also a big heart to this film & a genuinely pleasant little family film.Murphy was also great in these family flicks too, The Haunted Mansion, I Spy, Nutty Professor 1&2, Dr.Dolittle 1&2, Norbit, Meet Dave, Shrek & Showtime. The man is a legend",Daddy Day Care
21,Agent10,"So sticky sweet that you might be sick or satisfied, depending on what kind of person you are",6,11 June 2003,"Okay, okay. How exactly do you give a movie like this a horrible grade? It's too cute to call bad, and how can an innocent children's film be considered a corrupted form of entertainment. Well, I guess I'm a sucker. With all of the cute kids, the laughable Star Trek fan (Steve Zahn at his best), and a diverse collection of neurotic characters plays into a movie that was focused-grouped t o the point of near banality. But then again, you can't put this film down simply because the kids were so great. So, I put down Eddie Murphy, who must be longing for the days of Beverly Hills Cop. Sure, he was respectable and funny, but his hard hitting days are well past him. I will say this, Lacey Chabert was absolutely smoking, and Angelica Huston was perfect as the evil school marm.",Daddy Day Care
22,Rob_Taylor,Harmless fun for those who don't need swearing to find something amusing.,7,4 June 2003,"Y'know, it's kind of sad to see some of the comments bemoaning Eddie Murphy for not swearing enough anymore. It's almost as if some people equate foul language with humour. If you're one of those people who thinks a comic sketch is much funnier with swearing in it, then you'll no doubt not like Eddie in this movie.On the whole, I found DDC to be harmless, unpretentious entertainment aimed at kids, naturally, but with sufficient adult-only gags thrown in to keep the parents happy. In short, a formulaic kids movie designed to keep parents from being bored and kids amused.The plot is silly, and predictable, but you don't go to these sorts of films looking for deep and meaningful dialogue or witty social commentary. You just go to be entertained. And DDC does deliver on that score.
Of particular amusement is Steve Zahn, as the rather cliched Star Trek geek who is the only one who can speak to one of kids - in Klingon! He does kind of steal a lot of the scenes in which he's in. Anjelica Huston is starting to look real old, but still has that menacing screen presence that no doubt helped land her the role of Mrs Harridan (yep, that really is her name) in this picture. I'm thinking she would have made a much better Cruella de Ville than Glen Close's overacting scenery munching version in 101 Dalmations.The only thing I found a little irritating about this movie was the number of times a microphone popped into view at the top of the screen. I must have counted at least five instances. I kind of grew used to this in the 80's straight-to-video days, but you don't really expect to see it nowadays, so it was a little annoying.Other than that, the movie is harmless and fun. And for those that complain about Eddie not swearing enough....this is a KIDS film, you know.",Daddy Day Care

25,Beta_Gallinger,"Sometimes mildly amusing, sometimes almost disgusting, but usually mediocre",5,5 November 2008,"As one would probably assume, this is another cheesy family comedy. Now, I guess movies can be somewhat cheesy and still enjoyable, but if you ask me, that's not the case with this film. I saw a bit of ""Daddy Day Care"" early in 2004, the year after it came out, but don't recall thinking too much of it. Nearly five years later, I finally decided to rent it the other day and see the whole thing, even though my expectations certainly weren't high. Basically, it turned out to be what I expected, a mostly unfunny PG-rated family film, there were definitely no big surprises.Charlie Hinton and his colleague, Phil, work for the health division of a food company. However, when this division is shut down, they both lose their jobs. After this, both of them are unemployed, with no job opportunities in sight, so they become stay-at-home fathers. However, Charlie soon gets the idea for the two to open their own day care centre called ""Daddy Day Care"" in his house, and manages to get Phil to agree. While it does turn out to be quite challenging at first, their day care becomes a success. However, as it becomes more popular, the Chapman Academy becomes less popular. The harsh headmistress of that school day care, Mrs. Harridan, is not happy about having new rivals in town, and will do anything she can to try and put an end to Daddy Day Care! The movie begins with Charlie's young son, Ben, starting his day, put to Katrina & The Waves' hit song, ""Walking on Sunshine"". At one point, the song stops, we hear Ben urinate, and then the song continues. I guess that's supposed to be a gag, but it's a fairly poor one, no doubt about that. Comedic mediocrity continues throughout most of the film, and sometimes, it may get close to annoying. There are some fart jokes (big surprise *sarcasm*), unfunny ones, as usual. There's also a major excretion gag, with a kid at Daddy Day Care telling Charlie how he missed the toilet. Fortunately, at least it doesn't show the huge mess, it just shows Charlie's reaction, looking all over the bathroom in shock. Still, that gag is pretty lame, and if there were many more gags like that in the film, it would probably be below average. It isn't all straight-faced, there are some mildly amusing scenes, such as Marvin (who eventually joins Charlie and Phil) communicating with a kid in Klingon, and maybe times when the Three Stooges are on TV, but there's nothing TOO funny (at least not for adults), certainly not enough to make up for the lameness.I didn't know this movie spawned a 2007 sequel, ""Daddy Day Camp"", featuring a different cast, with Cuba Gooding Jr. as Charlie Hinton and Paul Rae as Phil, instead of Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin in those roles. ""Daddy Day Care"" certainly isn't the most popular family comedy ever made, but I see that its sequel is generally considered much worse, so obviously, I do not intend to ever watch it. While this 2003 film isn't exactly terrible, it's obviously more for kids, as you would probably expect with a title like ""Daddy Day Care"". Some adults MIGHT like to watch it with their kids, but other than that, I don't recommend it for adults. In any case, don't expect anything too surprising or original about this cheesy family movie. It's certainly not the first lacklustre comedy starring Eddie Murphy.",Daddy Day Care

Amazing little actor, capable of turning his face into the saddest one you've ever seen, or the happiest, depending on what's called for. And the outtakes at the end are cool too.

It was produced by Revolution Studios and released by Columbia Pictures. Advertiser Charlie Hinton (Eddie Murphy) and his best friend Phil (Jeff Garlin) are working on a new line of children's cereal when they get fired. Now they have to stay home taking care of their young children while their wives work. With little money to pay for a decent daycare for his son, Charlie decides to open his own at home, even though he and Phil don't get in the slightest with the many little bugger kids running around. However, over time, ""Daddy's Day Care"" gets more children and soon becomes a success, which begins to disrupt the rigid Miss. Harridan (Anjelica Huston) who, annoyed by the competition, decides to act to close the site. Very fun movie with a simple script, not the fun of the movie! Despite the movie Eddie Murphy's character Charlie Hinton is a fumbling think that creating a day care does not require so much work but shows his very convincing performance and is improving over the course of the movie and so my film score is 6.0.Movie seen on April 17, 2019",Daddy Day Care

This is really one of the worst movies of 2003 making me laugh at the movie instead of with it. I mean really what was Murphy, Garlin, Zahn, Huston, as well as Regina King who gives the only good performance in the entire movie thinking while making this miserable movie watching experience. But I was originally going to give this movie 1 star but had to give it two because Regina King gave the only good performance, and by the way those of you people who liked this movie watch it again to see if you change your mind about this laugh less comedy.",Daddy Day Care

Charlie and Phil are so consumed by their advertising jobs that they are completely missing out on the joys of fatherhood. After failing to excite the public about vegetable cereal, Charlie and Phil are fired from their ad jobs. While in search of employment and tending to his four-year-old son Ben during the day while his wife Kim is at work, Charlie has an idea. If he and Phil can handle taking care of two kids, how much harder can it be to supervise ten? Much harder than they ever imagined. But, they will try to manage to pull through and not let Miss Gwyneth Harridan ruin their day care. The plot doesn't sounds great but it does have some potential, Fortunately, it delivered as this is film was actually quite funny. It wasn't over the top funny or Finding Nemo funny but it defiantly can stand on its own. At most times Daddy Day Care may just seem like a film with a bunch of screaming kids and nothing else which isn't true as there are many laughs to be found as well. Eddie Murphy stars and gives quite a funny performance. The real stars of the film though are the little kids. Most of them were funny, some were annoying but they were all tolerable. Regina King plays Kim and she doesn't really appear in the film very much but gives a funny line or two. Steve Zahn was really funny as Marvin. Sure sometimes his character was too stupid to like but it never crosses the line. Anjelica Huston plays the same role I usually see her in, she plays a mean person well but it is tiring seeing her do the same thing. Lacey Chabert has a small but funny role and she is a bit underrated. Jeff Garlin wasn't that good, like when compared to everyone else he was weak and not very funny either. Steve Carr directs and does a decent job, nothing special. I don't know why I liked this movie as much as I did. It was stupid and kind of had a weak story but I still liked it. It does get dull at times, particularly the beginning as it starts off slow but it becomes funnier as the film continues. The running time is 92 minutes so it wouldn't be that much of a punishment to watch. The movie isn't very clever it's a simple film but it does contain enough laughs to entertain most people. Daddy Day Care is also a lot better then The Haunted Mansion. So, if you have a choice between the two, I would go with this one. In the end, this isn't a great film but it might fit the bill if you are in need for a family flick. Rating 6.7/10",Daddy Day Care

Murphy stars as the recently laid-off Charlie Hinton, who, with a friend, decides to open a daycare with men as the caregivers. That opens the door to all sorts of fun rambunctiousness, as the tykes make the entrepreneurs earn every penny. The side story about a prim and proper care center that won't let kids be kids is amusing, if not familiar, and makes a gentle social commentary. Murphy's performance is strong and convincing, and the comic supporting cast -- a geeky Steve Zahn and Saturday Night Live alum Kevin Nealon among them -- is great.

43,canuckteach,A more subdued Eddie shows that less IS more..,9,2 February 2008,"Caught this today on DVD with a buddy's grand-kids, and was pleasantly surprised. I have given it 9 out of 10, not for pure artistic merit, but as a funny 'family-film'. Certainly, the current rating here at IMDb is pessimistic. There are only 2 or 3 decent films of this sort produced annually in Hollywood, the rest being utter trash.Eddie Murphy plays a more subdued role than we might expect as a high-powered 'player' in the ad game, with little time for his family. A sudden change finds him desperate for work or an enterprise, in a plot ploy reminiscent of Michael Keaton's ""Mr. Mom"". The unfolding action finds Eddie scrambling to operate a day care facility with frenetic partners Jeff Garlin and, later, Steve Zahn. Murphy allows that duo to handle the slapstick end of things. He remains the thinker and the one who calms the waves of lunacy, allowing the plot to move forward to the next challenge facing our heroes.The satirical side of this story is shown by examining the competing (snotty) daycare center of the always-delightful Angelica Huston, reprising her 'vampy villainess' role of ""Ever After"". She runs a sophisticated academy for toddlers that Fraser and Niles Crane might envy (but it really needs to be taken down a peg or two).Refreshing, too, is the portrayal of the daycare inspector unleashed on Eddie by Huston. Instead of the typical clichéd grump who threatens and hollers, we get a tender, supportive fella who really wants the boys to succeed (we find out why at the end - watch the puppet show carefully!).Garlin is the closest thing I've seen to a replacement for our departed and dear John Candy, a slightly over-sized actor who can combine tenderness with slapstick! Zahn was an unusual sidekick fit as 'Giordino' to McConaughey's 'Dirk Pitt' in ""Sahara"", and, here as a hapless Trekkie, impresses with his comedic timing.Other notables pop up in supporting roles, and the kids are terrific. Enjoy! Final word to other actors of (former) glory: check your ego at the door, share the limelight with a great supporting cast and find a real script with likable or compelling characters. in no particular order.",Daddy Day Care

He tries so hard, but just doesn't work like he used to. He should just quit and remember the days a long time ago.Daddy Day Care is mainly a kids movie, and all of the jokes are ones we have seen in other movies. It seems that today, most movies involving kids or animals are just part of a cliché.Unfortunately, all of the funny parts in this movie were shown in the commercials, leaving us with nothing but stupid stuff.Eddie Murphy has changed a lot though, in some ways it's a good thing, this way kids will be able to watch some of the movies he's in.

I had no desire to ever watch it but was somewhat curious as to why my mother would buy it. With nothing much else to do on my recent Thanksgiving break, I thought I should give this movie I shot.Well, it turns out the movie wasn't that bad at all. It had some good, funny moments and was quite a cute and likable movie. The kids in the movie did a great job, and my hat is off to any director and actor that has the patience to work with that many kids on the set. I can't imagine that it was smooth sailing all the time for them.As for the adult actors, Eddie Murphy exhibited why he is still a likable and enjoyable actor to watch. Sometimes you can't help but like the guy. I also enjoyed Jeff Garlin's performance. He's probably the main reason I watched the movie in the first place as I thought he did a great job as the Roastmaster on Comedy Central's Roast to Denis Leary. Plus, Steve Zahn did a great job too and got me laughing. No matter what he is in, he doesn't seem to disappoint. And let's not forget the good job by the so-called villains, Anjelica Huston and Lacey Chabert. Finally, it was kind of a kick to see Kevin Nealon and Jonathan Katz make appearances.So there were actually quite a few likable moments from the movie. Quite surprising, I think. Now, it's not a perfect film. It wasn't a riot every second and wasn't all that touching or moving of a picture, but it got the job done.

This movie fails that test: there really is nothing at all beneath the surface. On the other side, I suppose some adults might accept 5- and 6-y/o kids as being 3, but to first-graders toddlers are ""babies"" and certainly not to be confused with their own age-mates. Well, if you put those considerations aside, this is a reasonably enjoyable film, and the message -- that men can be nurturant caretakers of small children, and may even bring some special skills to the job -- is a welcome one.

51,rachelgallit,Foolhardy and Foolish and Funny,9,16 February 2019,"Daddy Day Care (2003) is a farce down to its very core. The concept/plot is based upon a belabored and elaborate conception that men cannot watch and manage children, simply on the fact that they are men. Two businessmen and fairly absent fathers attempt to make money after being laid off by opening their own economically affordable daycare for local children. Hijinks ensue, as the pair attempt to wrangle an army of strong-willed and oddly malicious children in their converted home, and defy the societal expectation of their inevitable gender-based failure. The whole situation is illogical and a non-issue, but makes for an entertaining film. Matt Berenson (producer) staged the film in a simple and easy to track manner, keeping sets isolated and contained and easy to understand, and the characters strictly archetype, which the audience can grasp with little effort. The actors themselves are by no means stellar, but fit the exaggerated nature of the role well. There is little central plot, but rather the film is bulked up with comical catastrophies and adorable children behaving in oddly adult ways.

In 'Daddy Day Care' he plays an unemployed father who starts up a daycare center to make extra money and rival the competing preschool thats like 'Harvard for toddlers'. He starts it up with his co-worker played by Jeff Garlin. On their first day they have no clue how to take care of kids and feed them junk food and sing songs. They eventually get the hang of it and hire a third 'daddy' played by the hilarious Steve Zahn. He has lots of funny lines and physical comedy. The kids are cute and funny. Garlin is funny. But Eddie is just mediocrely acting his way through the movie. You could have basiclly put any actor in his role. He is suffering through the same slump as Adam Sandler is...playing the straight man. Act goofy! Do something funny with food or something. Or at least say something witty! Eddie hasn't been funny since 'Nutty II'.

58,mxracer157,id love a peanut butter and jelly sandwich after this scene,7,26 February 2005,"typical Eddie Murphy. one of the funniest movies he has made in years. mimics the style of comedy of the nutty professor movies which he was quite funny in. movie has a funny way of making you face open moments that you don't think about normally. introduced many things into peoples minds with humor without being obvious about it. Jeff garlin plays a wonderful part in this also. the part he plays though reminds me of jack blacks roll's in movies. Steve zahn yet again comes through as the lovable moronic nerd. its that type of writing that made this movie so funny. you'll find yourself laughing at the smallest things. with any three other actors, this movie wouldn't have worked. but with Murphy, garlin and zahn, it goes well. the best point about this movie is the acting of the children. they are all wonderful actors and make this movie a must have for anyones DVD collection. writing could have been better, but then again, this was a family comedy, not one such as animal house!",Daddy Day Care
59,dav7nine,Good film!,7,27 November 2004,"I really liked this.... I love Eddie Murphy so thought I'd watch this, but didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. The supporting cast is very funny: Steve Zahn in particular - I was crying with laughter at one point... in fact more than one point!2 dads basically get paid off and over the following weeks while struggling to care for their own kids they have the idea of starting a day-care centre. It's just a barrel of laughs after that.... mind you I am biased towards Murphy...The highlight is Zahn introducing himself to one of the mums..... I wet myself - hahaha hahaha lol :-)7/10",Daddy Day Care
60,mrliteral,More tasteless than veggie-o's,1,30 December 2003,"It tells you right up front what kind of 90 minutes you're in for - the over-used, aged, and annoying song ""Walkin' on Sunshine"" plays over the opening, and PAUSES so we can clearly hear a four year old boy peeing, then flush the toilet. Then the song resumes. This is the focus of the story from this point, and they're just making it clear up front. Partway through there is a pointless flashback, used only to show how a man doesn't like changing diapers. What brilliant screenwriting. What's really funny about this movie is if you take out the jokes about peeing, pooping, farting, falling, kicks to the crotch or other sensitive areas, and change the kids from gremlins who do nothing but run around screaming into more realistic children, it might actually be humorous, but of course it would only be twenty minutes long.There is not one original sentiment. One of the few times I laughed was when Jeff Garlin's character, in response to how unimpressive their child care license certificate is, says ""that's gonna be laminated."" Of course, the filmmakers ruin it by having him yell out ""LAMINATED"" as he leaves that room, making it no longer funny. Steve Zahn does the best he can with an underwritten part, though brilliant comic actor that he is, even he can't do much to rescue this garbage. Eddie Murphy should probably start reading scripts again, because I'm pretty sure he didn't read this one. He saw a potential for comedy and signed up based on that. Unfortunately, no one else bothered to follow through. I recognized this movie for what it was when it came out, and would never have bothered to see it, except someone loaned it to friend of mine and there was nothing else to do that night.",Daddy Day Care
61,stephen_thanabalan_fans,The Cast (even the kids) are tremendous fun!,7,3 September 2005,"Casting for this film was brilliant. In fact, it could not have been anything less, given that the final edited product - which boasts of great interplay and chemistry between the crew, cast and the kids- was a great family film (decent, entertaining, and heartfelt). What is particularly nifty is that in this film, like some others including Judge Reinhold's Vice Versa (1988), we get to see a children's movie for adults with both the kids and the adults sharing equal stage presence, which really is splendid. Eddie Murphy (now into his family man image phase) and fellow co-stars like Steve Zahn (playing yet another geeky role with slick comic timing) really capture the screen with their ability to play such innocently playful and tender roles and when you watch them engage in conversations with the child actors (who must have been a handful to manage), one can tell instantly there was chemistry on and off screen there (even child actors are kids and kids know who to trust) that went on to boost the production set.The credits even run a series of bloopers which showed the whole cast and crew crying out in laughter after the some of the cherubic kids deliver hilarious comments in between takes. The fun and interaction they must have all shared as a crew unit must have been dewy cheeked wonderful! This boost spills over into the film as one can definitely sense the fun filed atmosphere, and even if someone disagrees they'd definitely agree that there was loads of confetti colour and delightful rainbow filled moments throughout the film, which kind of also is a credit to the originality of this film's screenplay.",Daddy Day Care
62,Ref65,Eddie Murphy's worst performance in a movie,2,15 February 2008,"This has to be one of the one of the worst comedies to walk on the face of the Earth,the acting is dreadful,the plot sucked and Eddie Murphy put on a bad performance.I've seen Eddie Murphy in the Shrek movies and he put on great performances.It's about to lads who call themselves losers and put up a daddy day care center and they soon find out that they can't control the kids and an inspector comes and says they need more staff or else he will shut daddy day care down but fear not...the two boneheads have a plan that doesn't seem to work and daddy day care gets shut down.The only way to reopen it is to find a bigger place,more staff and try to get the kids back from some school for kids aged 2-4 or something like that.This movie is a real joke that can't make you laugh instead it makes you sleepy.The story isn't that bad but nothing is funny except the part when a kid comes out of the bathroom and says ""I missed""and Eddie Murphy looks in the bathroom and the music from ""Psycho"" comes on.Eddie Murphy fans will be extremely disappointed with this movie but I kind of doubt they will like it but its your choice to watch it.This really is a really bad movie and that includes Eddie Murphy's performance.I would only watch this again if I have to pick a choice between ""The Pink Panther"" or this,I would watch this movie again This is a movie that should be avoided at all costs and don't say that I didn't warn you if you're disappointed.What a waste of time and film.",Daddy Day Care

It made some good points about the way men are treated in relation to taking care of kids.But it wasn't really all that funny even though it had one of the funniest actors in the biz playing the lead character.

65,storytym,A wretched sign of how bad Hollywood has become.,1,27 May 2003,"One doesn't go to see a movie called DADDY DAY CARE hopingfor high art.  One merely expects competence, some fun, a coupleof laughs.  Some family entertainment, along the lines of MRS.DOUBTFIRE, etc.  This film delivers nothing of that sort.  It flatlines throughout. Thestructure goes something like this: characters explain instraightforward, witless dialogue what their current problem is. Characters choose equally witless solution to problems.  10-15seconds of chaos ensue, then lead character starts worryingabout his kid, and platitudes follow. That's it. No plants and payoffs, no character arcs, nothing buildstoward a finish.  It's staggering how lazy this film is.  My jaw hit the floor a couple oftimes at the sheer ineptitude of it.  For instance, the daddies learnthere's a beehive on their porch.  So they have to get rid of it.  Okay,that's possibly an obstacle where you could a funny way to get overit. Instead the filmmakers simply send Daddy Two to go hit thebeehive with a broom handle.  Guess what?  The bees come outof the hive when that happens. And as a topper, they chase DaddyTwo!!! And even Daddy Three!!!   That's what Hollywood thinks isfunny in 2003.  Never mind that audiences in 1915 would haveyawned at such a scenario.  It gets much worse, but I'm trying to forget that I spent 30 buckstaking the family to see this mess.  I'll get over the thirty bucks, but I'm truly sad that Hollywooddemands so little of its filmmakers now, especially in comedies. In action movies, and suspense thrillers, there's good Hollywoodproduct.  But good comedies are few and far between.  And whena movie like this does well in the box office, it kills off all hope.Please don't see this movie.  You'll only encourage them.",Daddy Day Care
66,horsecrazy6791,Not Too Bad...Surprisingly,8,7 November 2005,"Ever since I saw ""Baby Geniuses"" I automatically hated any movie that involved obnoxious young toddlers...especially babies who are supposed to be smarter than everyone else. But two years ago when I was in grade six, and it was in theaters, a couple of my friends wanted to see it, so I thought ""how bad could it really be?!"" After I saw this movie, I was so0o0 glad i gave it a chance! It was so cute and funny and the little kids weren't as bad as I thought they would be. I actually never knew that Elle Fanning would be in it.I am a huge fan of her sister Dakota, and I like her a lot too. She is following right in her big sister's footsteps. And even though she wasn't a main character, she was really cute in the scenes she was in like when she called 911 after Crispin stole her doll and ripped off it's head.I guess making this movie would be kind of hard, seeing as most of the actors are four and five year old children. It might be a little hard to get them to do everything you want them to, but obviously they did a great job, because the movie turned out awesome! Eddie Murphy was so funny and it was pretty clear that he enjoyed working with the kids and vice versa.This is a great movie to watch if you ever feel like a laugh. After I bought the DVD, I saw some of the bonus features which were pretty cute. You get to find out more about the kids in ""Daddy Day Care"" and their point of view on being in it. They're actually all pretty cute. So if you feel like seeing a funny movie, go out and rent this one. 8/10.",Daddy Day Care

Too much analysis by film fans worrying about where this film fits into Eddie Murphy's oeuvre. Get a life!  Get married, have children, let them grow a bit and then sit down with your spouse and kids and watch Daddy Day Care.  You'll laugh at Murphy and at your own experiences as a parent. Your kids will laugh as well. I found that it's nice to view an Eddie Murphy movie with my preteens without squirming at his edgy humor.     And yes, Daddy Day Care is a quasi-remake of Mr. Mom, but Eddie Murphy is a far more gifted comedian than Michael Keaton (can you imagine Micheal Keaton as Donkey in Shrek?) and this movie has more genuine humor than Mr. Mom.  Lots of like-able characters, the child actors turned in good performances, and the adult characters were varied without being over-the top extreme or bizarre. Nicely done.

72,mattwillandis,Don't really understand the hate,7,12 November 2020,"This is a simple little self contained Eddie Murphy comedy. Admittedly, this is not high class entertainment, but it's not bottom of the barrel either. When a joke falls flat, it doesn't overstay it's welcome, as a decent amount of stuff is packed into this quick little film. I honestly adored this film as a kid, though I must admit I didn't really understand what was happening then. But as a whole, this film has a lot more energy and heart than many other comedies, and it shows. The cast is good, with the main child actor being pretty weird in his performance, but hey, he's four, he would be a little weird in real life! The rest of the kids are good, and mrs Adams is a fine villain. She's nothing very different, but atleast she has character, and isn't just pure evil like so many other villains can be. And while it's message is a bit muddled, it's still understandable, and quite sweet. In my opinion the film is at its best when the kids come, as the none stop chaos is quite amusing and not all that unrealistic either. I give this a 7, it's not an all time great, but it's still a funny, good, entertaining Eddie Murphy film. I'd give it a chance, especially with kids.",Daddy Day Care

74,corpse_man,"Great fun, great message.",8,4 May 2021,"This movie was filmed about a decade and half before the trend of shoe horning a strong anti patriarchy message into the main plot became a common theme, which makes it extra refreshing to watch it now in 2021.And the thing is, this movie has a stronger pro woman message than all the new movies that try to create a ""strong female"" character, by dumbing down the men, making them all incompetent in every aspect of life. In many, many new movies men are implied as inherently evil, misogynist and live for the sole purpose of hurting women, who are all by nature, just superior to men in every way.In this movie, it's more about smashing gender roles. The men do jobs that were previously said to be more ""womanly"" jobs, and the women have careers. I think this sends a way better message than modern movies do. A message that men are capable of taking care of kids, and doing ""womanly"" things like cooking and cleaning. This means those things are not just ""wifely"" duties and women are free to have their own professional careers and can have jobs previously thought to be jobs of men, while men take care of kids. Messages like this were actually positive. (and they were not in every movie) The new ""feminist"" message crammed into almost every movie is just very negative and does not help contribute to a better society. It just causes conflict and anger on both sides.I miss movies like this. Fun, light hearted, not too crammed with ideological messages, and the ones it does have are positive and just about actual equality.",Daddy Day Care

76,Fyodor_Karamazov,Worse than it seems...,3,12 June 2003,"I ultimately decided to give this film a chance despite its awful critical reviews based upon my experience that low-brow comedies are often brutally panned when in fact they achieve precisely what they set out to achieve by providing low-brow laughs.  Roger Ebert is one of my favorite film critics, a guy who does not normally hold all films against the requirements for excellence, but after I finished viewing the recent low-IQ comedy ""Old School"" for the second time in a row, I was disappointed that Ebert hated it so much.  Thus, I figured how bad could ""Daddy Day Care"" really be?The answer: really bad.  Really, really bad.You could do worse (""Wrong Turn"" may still be playing at a theatre near you), but this is just the sort of formulaic Hollywood psuedo-family comedy that is so tried and true it should work, but falls short in every laughless scene.  The formula is remarkable similar to films like ""Liar, Liar"", except this one simply doesn't have the same oomph that made that stupid comedy somewhat watchable.  Most of the adult actors appear bored with the picture themselves and probably angry with their agents for letting them sign the contracts, and the only amusing moments are provided by a few of the children (a la ""Kindergarten Cop"") and surprisingly by Steve Zahn as a socially-challenged Star Trek/comic book geek who just so happens to deal extraordinarily well with children.  (When asked why, he responds, ""I read Dr. Spock's book on child development.  It's not about Star Trek!"")Some might advise you wait until video or DVD for this one, but I suggest you only view the trailer - it literally contains the only good parts to the film.3/10",Daddy Day Care

My mother in law bought it for our family for Christmas and we have watched it 3 times since, and I laugh more and more each time. Eddie Murphy is truly a genius. I enjoyed his hard core stand up comedy, his Beverly Hills Cop movies, Coming to America, etc. and now am enjoying watching him in family movies like the Dr. Dolittles and Daddy Day Care. It is good clean fun our family can enjoy together, and that is rare nowadays. The little boy who plays Murphy's son is absolutely precious, and the casting for everyone was perfect, from Murphy's wife to his day care business partners. I have read reviews where people thought the movie was juvenile. Well, it is about children, so I don't know what the expectation was. Anyone who has spent time with little kids, or has kids of their own will definitely appreciate this hysterically funny film. The special features are fun too. There are interviews with the kids, and the kids do some interviewing too. Great music also!",Daddy Day Care

The acting is amazing; Even the young children have pulled off an amazing act. Khamani Gryffin delivered his childish lines with such believability that one could be close to tears with the simple line of 'You can sell my toys.', and Max Burkholder can truly portray a cute, trouble making child with ease. The adults are amazing actors to, especially Eddie Murphy.

So, she calls the childcare officer twice, and both times they slide out. But, the third time he tells them that they need to get a bigger building.The movie is surprisingly good, with decent acting and genuinely funny moments. The movie is pretty mature for what is obviously a kid movie. However, this movie does suffer from occasional joke droughts and a good, but cheesy, ending. Still, this movie is recommended and will make a good edition to your collection, especially if you like Eddie Murphy. However, if you want the Eddie Murphy constant cursing, steer clear.

However I also know that we've passed the point of no return on this one, we will never again see the strong 80's Eddie that we once loved. I suppose we should look at this as a new chapter in the career of one of America's funniest men, and while it is depressing I'm still slightly awed that Eddie is still on the scene. After several blundering movies and one very sorry attempt at singing stardom we find an enduring man who can in fact change with the times.

86,virlyn2,Comedy? Where?,1,22 January 2008,"Except for his role in Beverly Hills Cop, I think Eddy Murphy is a bad actor. And once again he confirmed my thoughts on him playing Charlie Hinton in this herendous euh thing. The first 20 minutes are unbelievably boring, as you already know from the start he's going to get fired and start a day care with his idiotic friend. But no, first you get to know the characters and what they stand for. After 20 minutes of lame conversations you finally understand how a nice guy Charlie and how cute his fat friend is. They are those typical cliché family guys who do stupid things once in a while but who you can always count on . Thanks for the introduction.The only reason you keep on watching is the hope that there will be some funny action going on after they started their day care. But no, nothing happens. Just a bunch of kids running around screaming and shouting, chased by our two charming protagonists. No, a guy getting kicked in the nuts and completely overacting is not funny. No, two guys disguised as a carot and a brocoli is not funny. No, one of the guys paying a kid to get in the house is not funny.And what about the evil kid? what was that? and the kid in his flash costume suddenly running extremely fast? was that supposed to be funny? but lets cut to the chase, this movie is so fking bad, its awful. There's just nothing funny about it, nothing nothing nothing. I would never show this piece of dog turd to my children. This is not a nice-time-with-the-family-on-a-cozy-Saturday-evening-film.

Thanks for doing a professional review and giving the film kudos, where it is due.  It has become ""Hip"" to dog Eddie Murphy for not being the ""Old Eddie Murphy.""  But, what's wrong with him playing the straight man?  I felt that Eddie is trying to play his character in Daddy Day Care, as a serious actor.  That's OK with me.He seems to get criticized like Jim Carey does.  When Jim Carey does his shenanigans a lot of people say, ""oh, he's always doing those stupid antics!""  Maybe Eddie doesn't want people to dog him in this way.  It seems these guys can't win.  Sure, I would have liked to have had some ""big belly laughs"", but I think that's a fault of the script, not Eddie Murphy.  I hope we'll see Eddie in some GREAT projects, in the future.  I think he can be a serious actor and still have us in stitches.  I think it will just take the PERFECT vehicle. I saw the film this weekend with 100's of kids in the audience.

I am sure when watching it alone it won't be super, but when with you'll have those moments of looking over to eachother and just start laughing. When the credits were rolling over the screen, and me & my friends/family walked out, we all had a general feeling of happyness, and in the end, that's priceless.Although I'm not a huge fan of movies that have kids in them, I'd rate this one 6.5/10",Daddy Day Care
94,Critic_O,Speechless,10,24 May 2003,"Over ninety minutes of my life have been cruelly snatched from me. I feel like a crime victim and I don't know who to turn to. There is no justice in this world, if a movie like this could be made. To say it is flimsy would do injustice to respectable craparama such as the Nutty Professor II and Shanghai Knights (possibly every single Jackie Chan movie baring Police Story 2 and Rush Hour). Ladies and gentleman, I am a simple man, with simple tastes and I can laugh easily, but that film was devoid of humor. Those poor children who starred in this film will never live down the shame of being in such a terrible film. There was only one saving grace and as sexist as this may sound, I credit those women (Leila Arceri, Lisa Edelstein, Lacey Chabert), who though GROSSLY UNDERUSED, especially Miss Chabert, kept my attention as eye candy. To say that this film is for children, in my mind is terrible insult to those who we call children. The worst point of the film is the fact that it says it is wrong to try to teach kids as opposed to letting them become savage like buffoons. I now know why the world is declining into a quagmire of stupidity. Flims like these are being constantly greenlighted and until they stop, no one is safe. Anyone who can claim that this trash is a movie ought to be taken out into the fields and summarily shot!
Long Live Eddie Murphy!",Daddy Day Care

96,spntwdcm,Full of laughs,8,27 May 2019,"I just want to start by saying I absolutely love Eddie Murphy he is hilarious and rarely even does overtly mean comedy which I like very much.
Now There are certain things I did not enjoy, Like the way some of the adult disagreements where not handled like adults , but I understand that it is a comedy and that is why they chose to have the adults act like children at times.
But all in all this movie great fun for the whole family and is quite the tearjerker but for good reasons",Daddy Day Care
97,bc-wagstaff,Brett Wagstaff,8,29 July 2006,"I went to the movies and sew Daddy Day Care in the year 2003. After seeing Daddy Day Care at the movies. I borough the Video and I borrowed the movie out so many times from my local video shop. I like the movie Daddy Day Care, I like the part when they rasin funds to re - open the child care up and running again. I Also like the ending part of the movie as well.Daddy Day Care is a very funny fun movie to watch over and over again. I recommend it to the the whole family to watch because the movie its self is funny and fun, I recommend it to all ages in the country. I would like to see a Daddy Day Care 2 to come out to the movies in the year 2007 or in 2008, because the first one was funny.",Daddy Day Care
98,handylee-69427,SO FUNNY MOVIE!,9,15 April 2021,"The idea of daddy day care just amazing, also i feel so enjoyable when i watch this movie, Grab some popcorn to more enjoy and better watch it with your love one! Happy watching!",Daddy Day Care
99,tvluver,I am not going to pay to see another Eddie Murphy movie.,2,9 May 2003,"No need to pay $7 -10 to go see a movie that you can just watch the previews for.  I found very little to laugh at because every funny thing in the movie had already been seen in the preview.  It could have  been so much more. It seemed like they made the movie in a weekend -- it was thrown together, disjointed and just not funny.  My kids liked it but my husband and I did not.  Go at matinee prices or wait til video.  Just not that funny.",Daddy Day Care
100,kinggoddan,Eddie Can Do Better,7,4 June 2003,"First off I'd like to clear up that this WAS a pretty good movie. I just expected more from Eddie Murphy. Had it been another actor in his place, yes this movie might've pulled me in a little more. All in all it's a good flick, it has its moments but I do recommend seeing it. The kids were very cute and how can you go wrong with Lacey Chabert, I give it a 7/10.",Daddy Day Care
101,gocavs2008,i loved it,10,21 December 2003,i laughed every minute of it. I give it Two Thumbs Up. I liked eddie murphy. And the other guy too.,Daddy Day Care
102,gocavs2008,i liked it alot,10,21 December 2003,i loved this movie. everyone who hates it has no taste! I laughed every minute.!Every one who hates it is dumb. i like the part when they went to the other day cares and the lady had a cigarette in her mouth and she started coughing that was funny,Daddy Day Care
103,avigailbenzagmi,Its a great movie!!!!!!,8,28 July 2013,this movie is rated low just because its a comedy. If you check all the movies are comedies rated low (especially Eddie Murphys). Eddie Murphys is an actor who plays amazing and funny in many good movies. This comedy movie is good  for the whole family and very fun to see it t in a family movie night. If you choose not to see this movie because of its rating then you make a big mistake (believe me it's not a waste of time).its music is great. and you will enjoy watching it. I loved this movie sow match i watched it like about four times. this movie is good for all ages and don't be afraid to show it to your kids because its just fine.,Daddy Day Care
104,hindsfeet_highplaces,Cute and Funny,7,4 June 2021,"I really enjoyed this film. It was cute, fun, and funny. The cast was excellent and the story enjoyable.",Daddy Day Care
105,CCmirrors,My kid loves this movie.,8,18 March 2019,"I was looking for a film to watch with my daughter and this fits the bill perfectly, this movie isn't trying to be the next Citizen Kane, it knows what it wants to be and doesn't take itself too serious. I found myself laughing more than I expected (Jeff Garlin's character was of particular amusement to me) and I actually found myself thinking about many of the scenes from this movie the next day.The major value of this movie though is like I said, is a family friendly movie I can watch with my daughter.",Daddy Day Care
106,mholmes899,Feel good movie,10,20 July 2006,"Daddy daycare is a feel good movie for me. I'm not sure why but I never cared for Eddie's previous movies, expect for SNL. My son watches it with me and imitates the little boy, Ben. I think it's nice story of a man who really cares for the children and loves his son. There is no violence or cursing and I appreciate that. I also think there home is beautiful. I like looking at how they decorate. The kids are so cute. My favorite part is when Marvin meets Kelly for the first time and he falls for her. Marvin keep on tripping over his words. I would like to see a Daddy Daycare part 2. I hope this helps someone who hasn't seem this movie. That is all I have to say.",Daddy Day Care
107,wesleybarton-21644,Overly criticized film,10,8 June 2021,"A great film for family. I recently watched this movie and enjoyed the nostalgia it brought to me. Funny throughout and Eddie Murphy is splendid as usual. If you have not yet seen this film with the kids, highly recommended!",Daddy Day Care
108,mississippi,Entire Family Loved It,10,25 May 2003,We first saw Bruce Almighty then saw DDC.  All three of us--two with college degrees and one a business owner and the other a scientist--adored it. It was light-hearted entertainment that all could enjoy and we did.  I recommend it for the family.  Critical comments against the actors DO NOT FLY.  The movie as a whole does.  Go and ENJOY IT!!!!,Daddy Day Care
109,cschaffin,"It may be formula, but it works",6,10 June 2004,"Yes, this movie is formula, The kids are predictably cute, the daddies (Eddie and Jeff Garlin) predictably grow into their roles and become successful at it, the competitor (Anjelica Huston) is predictably ruthless, and the story unfolds as expected (think of ""Mr. Mon"" or ""Kindergarten Cop""). However, formula is OK if it is done right. This movie is formula done right which makes it a very enjoyable movie for the entire family.What made this movie for me was the interaction between Eddie Murphy and Khamani Griffin (Ben). You could see that there was real affection between them and their scenes together were the best in the entire movie. Sometimes, its the little parts of a movie that make the movie. These scenes do just that and are worth the price of admission.",Daddy Day Care
110,astonscookies,Great family film,10,12 October 2019,Fantastic easy watching film great for the whole film.,Daddy Day Care
111,sweet_daddy_c,Actually very enjoyable,8,21 February 2019,"I was extremely dubious when Daddy Day Care came up as a suggestion for an evening family film. But I have to admit I really rather enjoyed it.The thing that really stands out is Eddy Murphy, playing it down. I had forgotten how enjoyable Eddy Murphy can be when he's not going over the top. The ott went to to jeff Garlin and Steve Zahn, Jeff handling the slapstick and Steve handling the silliness, both switching roles when needed, but both handle them very well. I also had forgotten how good Steve Zahn can be in those kinds of roles,The rest of the cast do a good job, none really standing out as such, and Angelica Huston is simply there to fill the main villain role, and pick up a pay check, but does it with the usual grace she brings to roles.What also surprised me was the fact that the children are not embarrassing or annoying. Sometimes i find kids in films little annoying, but these kids act surprisingly well for their ages, and are just as entertaining as the adults. Although I sensed a bit of movie magic to get best out of them.So in all I was pleasantly surprised by this heart warming, genuinely funny film.If you want a good film to watch with your family, give it a go, you might be surprised too.",Daddy Day Care
112,RoxanneJackson1,This film is brilliant 10 out of 10!,10,8 April 2005,"I think this film is great. It had me laughing within the first five minutes of it starting. I can't even decide what part of the film is my favourite because it is all so good. It is a fantastic family film and will have any member of your family or your friends in hysterics. I spoke about this film so much that my mum went out and bought it for me and all I do is watch it over and over again still laughing as hard as I did the first time I saw it. I will not tell you what parts I find especially funny because I would not like to ruin it for anyone that hasn't yet saw the film. I am only 11 years old and I think the film is fantastic - I would say it was the best and funniest film I have ever seen. Children of all ages will enjoy this film, even children aged 3 or 4 will enjoy it because it is about children their age. Well done to the director 10 out of 10.",Daddy Day Care
113,sophomoresweetie07,The Best!,10,26 March 2005,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time! WHEN we rented it for a week, I watched it at least 3 times every day! Believe me, I could not get enough of it! It was funny, cute, lighthearted, a breath of fresh air! Perfect 10!~ I can't believe I don't have it! Now you know what to get for my birthday! The actors were great, especially the kids! I give huge props to Eddie Murphy and Steve Zahn, because they cracked me up during the entire film! Trust me, your money is worth getting this one! I love it so much, and that should be enough of a review! Itz great, OK? Now, I need to go. Peace, later, bye! Please, I'm tired of this comment myself! Let me go! Bye, the movie's great! Allahu Akbar!",Daddy Day Care
114,aneesahcameron,Cute family movie,10,9 May 2021,"This movie is so good especially for a family movie night. Eddie Murphy is great in all of his movies especially the family made movies. I feel like this movie is appropriate for all ages. Not sure why it has low ratings but don't let them fool you, it's worth the watch. I'm currently watching it now for the millionth time and I'm a grown adult lol.",Daddy Day Care
115,sftballsweetums,A very good movie.,10,7 June 2005,"I'm sorry but i think daddy day care is one of the best movies i have ever seen. its funny and had a good plot. I'm watching it right now actually. Eddie Murphy was as funny in this movie as he is in others. its a creative movie that the whole family can enjoy. who know.. it might be somebody's inspiration one day when they've been laid off. i laughed the whole time this movie was playing and the movie was by no means ""horrible"" like posted in other comments. Its one of those movies that one day when you are flipping through the channels on the t.v. and you see ""Daddy Day Care"" and you're like Oh, i haven't seen that in so long!its also a movie you could sit there and watch over and over. i don't know what you peoples problem is but its one of the best movies ever!",Daddy Day Care
116,mrso_ory,Wholesome Fun,7,27 August 2013,"This is just a funny and fun movie. And as one user wrote, the chemistry between all the actors and kid actors really makes the movie. We could use more movies like this. Nothing inappropriate either. It is one of those movies that you come away smiling. It's a feel good movie. I imagine if more people would support these kinds of movies maybe Hollywood would make more. I do wonder if there are more people than we think who secretly enjoy a good wholesome movie. And love Steve Zahn. Eddie Murphy is so good when he keeps it clean. He seems genuinely nice and, of course, love his voice for animated characters.Everyone in the cast really makes this movie charming.",Daddy Day Care
