0,SnoopyStyle,scattered parody,6,16 September 2015,It's the last day of Camp Firewood 1981 in Maine. Camp director Beth (Janeane Garofalo) is interested in physics professor Henry Newman (David Hyde Pierce) who lives nearby. Gene (Christopher Meloni) is the volatile Vietnam vet cook. Susie (Amy Poehler) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) intends to put on a show. Andy (Paul Rudd) is the bad boy making out with Katie (Marguerite Moreau). Gail von Kleinenstein (Molly Shannon) is the art teacher struggling with her divorce. Victor (Ken Marino) is a bumbling womanizer wannabe. McKinley (Michael Ian Black) is in a secret relationship with Ben. None of the camp counselors are terribly concerned about the kids' safety as craziness runs rampant.This is a scattered parody filled with random crazy characters and ridiculous situations. I first saw this a couple of years ago. The cast is a who's who of today's hottest stars. They seem to be having crazy fun doing silly skits. It's definitely a hit and miss proposition. It misses more than it hits but it misses with a charming stupidity.,Wet Hot American Summer
1,gavin6942,Pretty Funny Summer Camp Satire,6,19 February 2013,"The setting is Camp Firewood, the year 1981. It is the last day before everyone goes back to the real world, but there is still a summer's worth of unfinished business to resolve.What a great cast: Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler, Molly Shannon, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd and others. Some of them young and just on the verge of starting their careers (this was Cooper's first film). Others , like David Hyde Pierce, were stepping outside the box people had come to expect from them.I do love that it is a mixture of ""The State"" (greatest sketch comedy show ever) and ""Saturday Night Live"". I love that it features my favorite Loverboy song (""Turn Me Loose"") and I especially love all the pointless Wilhelm Screams.No thorough review is necessary. This film already has enough fans. While I think it may be slightly overrated, and not as good as ""They Came Together"", the love is understandable. Especially for Chef Gene, who is really the glue holding this picture together.",Wet Hot American Summer
2,Coventry,"Randomness, thy name is WHAS!",7,23 July 2021,"You cannot intentionally make a cult film. You make a film, and due to a number of largely undefined reasons, it may or may not evolve into a cult film; - either instantly or after several/many years. That's a theory I always firmly believed in. Why am I mentioning this here? Well, because - to me at least - it often uncomfortably felt as if ""Wet Hot American Summer"" was made with the deliberate and quite fanatic intention to be a cult film straight from its release. As a result, the film comes across as pretentious, with a too obvious ""this-comedy-is-better-than-rest"" attitude, and arrogant, with a sort of ""if-you-do-not-find-this-funny-you-are-wrong"" undertone. But, again, this is just my perception. And I've been wrong before.That being said, I didn't at all hate ""Wet Hot American Summer"". And it did become some kind of cult film, even if it were only for the fact that it splits the audiences into two extremely opposite camps. 50% of the people who watch this film absolutely love it, and claim it's the most brilliant and funniest comedy ever made, whereas the other 50% completely hate it and wonder out loud whether the writers weren't mentally disabled. Me, as so often the story of my life, find myself stuck right in the middle.The storylines in ""WHAS"" are occasionally very original and clever, and occasionally very weak and derivative. The jokes and type of humor are sometimes hilarious, but sometimes also tremendous misfires. All the characters are stereotypes and the themes are clichéd, but on the other hand, the situations are practically always unconventional, dared and unseen. The biggest trump of this film is undoubtedly its spontaneity and randomness. Literally everything can happen in ""WHAS"", regardless of how random, illogical or far-fetched it may seem. For that alone, this oddity deserves at least seven stars and my strong recommendation to check it out.",Wet Hot American Summer
3,Hey_Sweden,"""I hope it's not jumbo shrimp, I'm allergic to oxymorons!""",6,30 August 2018,"""Wet Hot American Summer"" is a mildly amusing 21st century nod to vintage summer camp comedies from the 1970s and 1980s. It's a rather loose, obviously improvisational feature that gets by mostly due to a fearless nature, a style patterned after Z.A.Z. spoofs where you can also see something funny going on in the background, an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" approach, and a largely endearing cast, many of whom are playing characters that are supposed to be much younger than they actually were at the time.That doesn't mean that it's consistently funny, but it does have some surprises here and there, as in, ""Ha ha, I can't believe they actually just did that."" The finale juggles subplots including attempted romance amongst counsellors, a falling piece of Skylab, and a climactic last-night-of-camp talent show. Be warned that the movie is most assuredly NOT for kids (despite the presence of them in the story), and that the R rating should be taken seriously.Set in 1981, this is one of those movies that constantly has to use rock songs from the period to remind you of the fact. Not that this viewer minded hearing them, but it's still such an obvious thing to do.There are loads of stars throughout this large cast: Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Paul Rudd, Christopher Meloni, Molly Shannon, Ken Marino, Joe Lo Truglio, Michael Ian Black, Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, Judah Friedlander, etc. As you can see, the casting director leaned heavily on cast members of The State and SNL. Romantic lead Michael Showalter co-wrote the picture with director David Wain. Meloni is particularly funny as the weirdo cook who always has to remind us that he's a 'Nam vet.The can of mixed vegetables gets the most laughs - and gives the best performance in the movie.Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go smear some mud on my ass...Six out of 10.",Wet Hot American Summer
4,preppy-3,Strange but fun comedy,8,10 July 2009,"This takes place on the last day of a summer camp in August 1981. Camp leader Beth (Janeane Garofalo) has fallen for a man living next door (David Hyde Pierce) but doesn't know how to approach him. Coop (Michael Showalter) is a shy camp counselor in love with beautiful Katie (Marguerite Moreau)--but she's dating sex-obsessed jerk Andy (Paul Rudd). There are other subplots involving Christopher Meloni (almost unrecognizable), Molly Shannon and Amy Poehler.DEFINITE SPOILERS! This could have been another T&A comedy--but it isn't. In fact there's only flashes of nudity and the one hot sex scene is between two guys--McKinley (Michael Ian Black) and Ben (an unknown Bradley Cooper). In a refreshing twist the scene is very erotic and they're not made the butts of a joke. Heck, they get married later on!Sex aside, the humor in this is almost surreal. There's lots of visual gags coming fast and furious. They come out of nowhere--but they're often so funny you don't care. You see characters drugged out in one scene--in the very next they're fine. Also characters manage to show up at two different places at the same time! It's off putting at first but you get used to it. Some gags fall flat but when they hit they're hysterical. The cast is on full tilt and the movie rarely stops to take a break. This is a very strange movie but uproarious when it works. Recommended.Best line: ""I hope it's not jumbo shrimp because I'm allergic to oxymorons"".",Wet Hot American Summer
5,FlashCallahan,I would know if you worked here.....,4,28 June 2015,"Camp Firewood, 1981, and It's the last day before everyone goes back to the real world, but there's still a summer's worth of unfinished business to resolve. At the centre of the narrative is camp director Beth, who struggles to keep order while she falls in love with the local astrophysics professor. He is busy trying to save the camp from a piece of NASA's Skylab which is hurtling toward earth. And adding to the 'hilarity' we have, a dangerous waterfall rescue, love triangles, misfits, cool kids, and talking vegetable cans, and of course, the big talent show at the end of the day......I really cannot understand all the love that this film has. Yes, it has a lot of now famous faces in the movie, but honestly, the majority of the humour, nay, all of the humour falls flatter than an old man on an icy path.It tries to hark back to those saucy comedies from the eighties like Fraternity Vacation, and anything with the words Summer, Camp, and school, but this seems like it's trying way too hard to be bad, and the thing that made those movies so watchable, was that they were unintentionally bad, and hilarious for that reason.If anything, it is worth watching for just how many famous faces there are in the movie, and just how successful they have become. But all in all, it's an unfunny mess of a movie, trying to be too meta, too left-field, and too clever for its own good.ButPaul Rudd is funny, doing his best impression of Kevin the Teenager.",Wet Hot American Summer
6,StevePulaski,Was hoping for a wet hot discovering summer,5,11 September 2011,"Wet Hot American Summer is the kind of movie where you either get it or you don't. If you do, you're good. If you don't, you are the red-headed step child among your friends and are subject to ridicule because you didn't laugh all that much. I have to say I'm in that category, but I appreciated what the film was doing. It was trying to be a different movie for a certain crowd. It succeeds in being different, but not much else.I think that this film is appreciated by people who also worship The Big Lebowski and the new comedy Our Idiot Brother, also starring Paul Rudd. They have a certain quotable reputation and are filled with so many random and oddball scenes that they soon get the cult classic status. I did like The Big Lebowski, but didn't see much hope in a rewatch because of the humor only being truly hilarious one time around. Some have said that Wet Hot American Summer gets better with repeated viewings. I don't think I'll stick around to find out.The story is just thrown together with odds, ends, and characters. Everything is thrown against the wall and the characters wander aimlessly throughout the camp hoping to be hit on the end with some comical elements. We're at Camp Firewood, a Jewish summer camp, and this is the last day of the summer. Everyone is scrambling to find someone of the opposite sex, or same sex, to be with so they can share a kiss at the end of the summer talent show.The characters are has shallow as the no diving end at a pool. We have Beth (Garofalo), the camp director. Henry (Pierce), an astrophysicist. Coop (Showalter) who has a crush on Katie (Moreau), but unfortunately for him, Katie's boyfriend is the ungrateful, incompetent, ignoramus Andy (Rudd). Gene (Meloni), the Vietnam vet. And way more.Director David Wain is known for his odd style as he's written and directed Cartoon Network shows like Children's Hospital and Tim and Eric Awesome Show Great Job. So he does tackle a semi-original idea here. Too bad it's gone to waste. There's one scene where two boys discover their best friend is gay, and rather than taking it in a mature manner, writer Michael Showalter seems to be laughing while writing making the scene unnecessary and tasteless.For some reason, I've never liked the idea of a summer camp setting in a comedy. It's rarely taken in a fresh manner, and it always results in the same jokes again and again. Some horror movies, like Friday the 13th work because they are in a camp, at night, giving a creepy vibe to an already uneasy setting. In comedies that use the setting, it seems that every film is just random antics, with no rhyme or reason, filled with incompetent camp counselors and teenagers fueled by raging hormones and immaturity.The characters are drawn and made to be likable, but they are nothing but walking mannequins motivated by personal satisfaction, lust, ego, and hormones. Many of us are, but it rarely do these things make a good, likable film. If the film had been more about finding your inner self and more a coming of age story rather than just be a comedy run by the characters' ridiculous antics it probably could've been more inspiring and more entertaining.The acting and directing doesn't kill the film has much as the events and characters do. Wet Hot American Summer isn't horrible, but it's repetitive and predictable. What I found wrong may be what someone else finds perfectly fine. The legion of fans will have to accept my review and move on. For every one person who doesn't like this there are half a dozen more who do.Starring: Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Molly Shannon, Paul Rudd, Christopher Meloni, Michael Showalter.

7,=G=,There's no accounting for humor.,4,1 August 2002,"And ""Wet Hot American Summer"" has precious little humor to account for. Wasted talent diva Garofalo heads up  this vacuous and inane parody about the last day of summer camp which makes ""Terror Firmer"" look like Oscar material. Most likely to be appreciated by airheads. Not for mature audiences. (D+)",Wet Hot American Summer
8,g-bodyl,Wet and Hot!,8,3 June 2015,"Wet Hot American Summer is known as today to be a cult classic, and I can agree with that statement, because the film has the characteristics as a cult classic. It's a little-known film at the time of its release, and it stars a pretty big cast. I was surprised this film was made in 2001, because this has a definite 80's feeling. The film mostly works thanks to the factor of nostalgia and a great cast. The film is not perfect though. It tries to hard and as a result, we get some jokes that are pretty bad. Luckily, the satire was good enough to erase the memories of those jokes.David Wain's film takes place on the last day of summer camp in 1981 at Camp Firewood. There is unfinished business to be done, mostly in the form of finding love before the big talent show that evening.Speaking of big cast, this film has a good one. They all do a respectable job, and I think this movie brought them all on the map. I don't particularly have any favorites, but I liked Janeane Garofalo as the camp's boss, Paul Rudd as Andy, Bradley Cooper as Ben, and Amy Poehler as Susie.Overall, Wet Hot American Summer is a decent, nostalgia-filled film. It's not great and I feel the status of cult classic is questionable, but there is no denying that it can be an amusing film. The satire is spot-on, but some of the jokes fall up lame. The film is well-acted, which is great on a script that was mostly improvised. A good film, but hardly a classic.My Grade: C+/B-",Wet Hot American Summer
9,lesleyharris30,"Funny and Entertaining, that's All it Needs to be,",8,30 June 2015,"Wet Hot American Summer is a great movie with a very well written plot and a fantastic comedic cast. It's a really fun movie as we follow a dozen different characters on their last day of summer camp, hoping to achieve all the goals they hadn't done the entire time they were there. It's very funny, with so many jokes that you would have to watch it again to hear ones that you missed previously. I felt like the film was missing a lead role, something every movie should have. It's weird to see a movie where every character is likeable and there isn't any sort of antagonist either, this is certainly a problem as it dosen't have a character that holds the movie, but it is not a huge concern. The entire cast is terrific, they all seemed very dedicated and interested in their characters. They were all clearly having a ton of fun making this, which will come as no surprise, and the chemistry is superb. Simple, mindless fun. Wet Hot American Summer isn't for everyone, but the people that enjoy this type of humour will definitely like it, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. A group of camp counselors and attendants try to complete all their unfinished goals as they begin their final day of summer camp. Best Performance: David Hyde Pierce",Wet Hot American Summer
10,atlasmb,Uneven Parody,5,14 June 2020,"This is one of those parodies where everything is done in earnest. There is no winking at the camera, which is good. They include just about every movie cliché, with its accompanying dramatic music, and ramp up the drama to the point of silliness.But the humor is very uneven, as if we are reading a first draft, and editing is needed. Better examples of this genre are ""Scary Movie"" and the ""Brady Bunch"" films.The cast includes plenty of comedy talent, but they are often wasted. There are some very funny bits, but they are infrequent. (Cue the slow clap)Update: I won the Hopkins Prize for this review. I would like to thank all the little people who contributed to its success, including Herve Villechaize, Toulouse Lautrec, and Tom Cruise.",Wet Hot American Summer
11,tomgillespie2002,Feels like I'm too late for the party,5,13 February 2018,"With the sheer volume of teen sex comedies being released in the wake of unexpected smash-hit American Pie in 1999, Wet Hot American Summer flew way under my radar in 2001 and didn't come to my attention until Netflix announced that they were releasing a prequel series in 2015. It was a strange time when the likes of Chris Klein and Breckin Meyer threatened to become movie stars, but near enough all of the cast of Wet Hot American Summer have since established themselves as movie stars or famous faces in the comedy circuit and are still going strong. The film, directed by Role Models' David Wain, has also gone on to garner a cult following, thanks to its gleefully absurd sense of humour, anarchic storytelling approach, and 1980's setting.Set on the final day of summer camp in 1981, Wet Hot American Summer tells its 'story' in the form of vignettes, with most of the characters looking to get their end away one way or another. There's Beth (Janeane Garofalo), the camp's director who finds herself inexplicably attracted to shy astrophysics assistant professor Henry (David Hyde Pierce). Coop (played by co-writer Michael Showalter) has the hots for fellow counsellor Katie (Marguerite Moreau), but her attention is taken up by her rebellious and obnoxious boyfriend, camp badass Andy (Paul Rudd). Other characters include Gail (Molly Shannon), the heartbroken crafts teacher, Gene (Christopher Meloni), the intense Vietnam veteran who has a habit of accidentally revealing his bizarre sexual habits mid-conversation, Victor (Ken Marino), who must run miles back to camp if he hopes to get laid, and Susie (Amy Poehler) and Ben (Bradley Cooper), the seemingly picture-postcard couple who aim put on the greatest talent show the camp has ever seen.Most people's enjoyment of Wet Hot American Summer will hinge upon their willingness to accept the film's goofiness. It's a gag-a-minute: some jokes land, but most don't. It works best when at its most silly, like the sight of Marino struggling to jump over a tiny roll of hay in the road on his quest to lose his virginity, in a gag that brings Father Ted to mind, or Garofalo's one-hour trip into town that quickly descends into crack-smoking, granny-robbing depravity. But the film leans on the charm of its ensemble to get by, and with the sheer volume talent on show (Meloni and Rudd have never been funnier), it works well up to a point. As a nostalgia piece, it lovingly nails the era long before the likes of Stranger Things and It, and the result is a hybrid of Meatballs, Porky's and Friday the 13th. It's main problem is that it's lampooning something which isn't quite ridiculous enough to make fun of, so rather than a clever parody, it often resembles yet another entry in the teen sexy comedy wave that was thankfully dying out by 2002. Still, I understand the appeal and the cult following, but it feels like I'm slightly too late for the party.",Wet Hot American Summer
12,eddie_baggins,A fun dumb comedy with an amazing all-star cast,6,14 July 2019,"Put simply, upon release in 2001, Wet Hot American Summer was a disaster.Ignored by most critics, failing dismally at the box office and genuinely disappearing from many peoples radars, David Wain's 80's spoof comedy seemed like just another low-brow comedy destined for an unmemorable life, until low and behold, the cult circuit took over and Summer has become somewhat of a classic.Spawning a prequel and sequel series on streaming kingpin Netflix, Summer's reputation has grown over recent years thanks to the airplay its received from people's lounge-rooms and for the fact Wain's film is a hotbed of early career activity for some Hollywood's biggest players.Early career turns from the likes of Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, Joe Lo Truglio and Ken Marino as well as extended parts from established stars Janeane Garofalo, David Hyde Pierce, Christopher Meloni and Molly Shannon, Summer has one of the early 2000's greatest ensemble casts that helps make watching Summer in today's climate a genuine blast no matter what flaws the films has.As a film, there's a lot wrong with Summer, it has a bare bones story cut straight out of the Richard Linklater rule-book (think Dazed and Confused and Everybody Wants Some!! with less nuance) and a fair chunk of jokes fall relatively flat but thanks to its carefree charm and the natural charisma of its cast, much of Summer is an easy to digest joy.The dark sense of humor of Wain such as drowning children, crazed Vietnam war veterans with odd fetishes and a continual gag about a particularly long day timed with a frequent clock also help make Summer a black comedic delight, a comedy not afraid to go to some dark places even if its relatively non-existent story doesn't bother to delve deep into much else around its low-brow antics and end of summer camp activities such as a talent show or an odd game of capture the flag.The haphazard nature of the film and oddball happenings are the likely reason Summer has managed to overcome its early failures to achieve a long-lasting success and while it's by no means a cinematic masterpiece, it's hard to see how one wouldn't enjoy their time in Camp Firewood with a crazy collection of flawed yet lovable counselors.Final Say -A time-capsule of early career moments for a raft of well-liked stars and an entertaining throwback to the heyday of raunchy 80's comedies, Wet Hot American Summer is far from a masterpiece but a thoroughly fun and frivolous one of a kind romp regardless.3 cans of mixed vegetables out of 5",Wet Hot American Summer
13,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"There are two types of people: ones that went to overnight camp, and ones who did not",8,14 August 2013,"To not like ""Wet Hot American Summer"" is to never have gone to summer overnight camp. If you've had an authentic summer overnight camp experience, then something(s) in David Wain's film will resonate with you, with those ""somethings"" multiplying for every summer you've spent at camp.Admittedly, ""Wet Hot"" (and especially its characters) represents an absurd exaggeration of overnight camp, but overnight camp is one of few assured places and times when life feels exaggerated. Anything Wain and co-writer/star Michael Showalter write into the film can totally fly, and most of it is downright hilarious.""Wet Hot"" takes place in the last 24 hours at Camp Firewood somewhere in Maine. Everyone from the campers to the counselors to the director (Janeane Garafolo) is looking for that eleventh hour romance/hook-up, and Gerald ""Coop"" Cooperberg (Showalter) in particular finds himself unable to resist Katie (Marguerite Moreau), who considers him just a friend and has been hooking up with the obnoxious slacker Andy (Paul Rudd) all summer. Several other camp-themed subplots ensue from a rafting trip gone wrong to arts and crafts becomings a support group to preparations for the big end-of-camp talent show.A stellar supporting cast of future stars is testament to the kind of movie this is. Rudd, Amy Poehler, Ken Marino, Joe Lo Truglio, Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth Banks and Michael Ian Black make up this colorful ensemble of incredible improvisers, none of whom had yet to make it big. Garofolo, Molly Shannon and David Hyde Pierce were the veterans of this group when this movie was made.It often involves excessive swearing, but these actors handle the over-the-top humor expertly, and they even give some dimension to their caricatures. They represent everything you remember about camp counselors and camp staff, completely discarding the whole responsibility element of overnight camp. The campers are merely a collection of odd-looking kids who make faces in the background as their counselors make out with each other, but their casting is spot on.""Wet Hot"" is a classic in so far as how it parodies overnight camp, but as an '80s camp movie spoof, it can definitely be considered average. The movie, at times, gets so ridiculous (e.g. an hour in the local town turns into binge drug use, a talking can of vegetables) that it loses its grip on what it does so well from time to time. Wain and Showalter at times seem interested in making a clever comedy that's sharp on all sides, but so often they seem content with shenanigans. It creates an inconsistent brand of comedy, but one that casts a wider net in terms of different audiences having different humor preferences.Occasionally, the outrageous and the clever intersect and those are the moments when ""Wet Hot American Summer"" hits the mark. Katie's speech to Coop at the end of the film is nothing short of gospel to the hopeless romantic in all of us. Discovering life lessons plays a big part in what camp's all about, and inside every outrageous caricature and scene lies a little nugget of truth that anyone who's had that camp experience understands.~Steven CThanks for reading!

14,paul-allaer,"The long shadows of ""Wet Hot American Summer""",6,28 June 2017,"As ""Wet Hot American Summer"" (2001 release; 97 min.) opens, we are reminded that it is ""August 18, 1981 - Last day of camp"". We get to know the camp counselors and of course the kids at the camp. It's not long before the camp's morning activities start after a quick breakfast. At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing expertise, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: over the years this movie has garnered almost cult-like status, primarily because of the many up-and-coming actors and actresses who would in subsequent years become outright stars. The movie does a great job recreating the spirit of that era (early 80s). Direcor Davind Wain co-wrote the movie with Michael Showalter, who himself starred as lovable-unlucky-in-love Koop. (Showalter these days is best known for directing such comedies like ""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" and the just-released ""The Big Sick""). The movie's narrative lags a bit, and feels more like a loose stapling together of a bunch of SNL skits. But in the end, it's mostly fun to see these young performers at work (and see if you can spot them all): Brad Cooper, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon, Elisabeth Banks, Janeane Garofalo, etc. etc. The legacy (and long shadows) of the original movie is such that many of the original cast reunited in a limited TV series a few years back called ""Hot Wet American Summer: First Day of Camp"", and just now yet another TV spin-off (with a new cast) is making its way on air as ""Hot Wet American Summer: 10 Years Later"".I had heard and read about the original movie but incredibly had never seen it until recently. I was flipping channels, and by golly, there it was on Starz, just as it was about to begin. So of course I had to watch it. Glad I did. It's not so much a ""laugh out loud"" movie, and in any event these types of movies are best experienced in the theater with a live crowd around you, rather than watching at home.",Wet Hot American Summer
15,drqshadow-reviews,"Sketch Comics Unleashed, For Better or For Worse",5,23 August 2011,"This may have been the single dumbest movie I've seen since the Zuckers were in their prime, but it kept me laughing even as I told myself the jokes were too stupid to be enjoying so much. Featuring a crazy cast of alumnus from no less than four different sketch comedy shows (including about 75% of MTV's aging cult classic The State), it's overloaded with sight gags, rudimentary puns nestled behind every corner. Over two dozen primary characters compete for the chance to shout out the next punchline, none of which have the depth of a kiddie pool, while the story is merrily thrown into the brush and abandoned at several points. It's the kind of film you'd have made with the crazy guys who lived down the hallway in college if you'd had the time or the money.",Wet Hot American Summer
16,MBunge,Scattershot but enjoyable,6,29 June 2010,"Wet Hot American Summer is a comedy about summer camp, a spoof of movies about summer camp, a grab bag of random absurdity and a collection filmmakers and actors hamming it up as hard as they can. There are moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity, but just as many moments where you're left staring at the screen wondering ""How was that supposed to be funny?'It's the last day at Camp Firewood in the summer of 1981 and pretty much every stock summer camp storyline is trotted out for derision and mockery in this film. There's the love triangle between the geek camp counselor, the hot girl who treats him like her pet and the teen rebel she's really hot for. There's the desperate virgin counselor trying to make it with the camp slut. There's the lonely, divorced arts-and-crafts teacher, the weird camp cook, the kids stuck on a raft approaching the raging rapids, the big talent show, the big game against the kids from the ""evil camp"" and the outcast kids who come together to save the day. There's also a talking can of vegetables that boasts of his sexual prowess, a gay subplot that seems to have wandered in from another movie, the old space station Skylab, the worst motorcycle chase in film history, some generic 80s allusions and the charm of a bunch of people who clearly had a great time making this thing.Filmmakers David Wain and Michael Showalter take a scattershot approach in Wet Hot American Summer, throwing jokes against the wall to see if they stick. On one hand, they'll do a running gag about the kid at camp who never takes a shower all summer, which could come from any number of traditional comedies about this subject. On the other hand, they'll do a lot of parodies of summer camp movies, like having a kid actually drown while two 30something teenage counselors french kiss with abandon. On the gripping hand, they'll just just chuck something odd on screen like a visual gag about Kenyan marathoners. Some of it works, some of it doesn't, but the movie moves along quickly enough that when a joke bombs, the smell doesn't linger.As far as the acting goes, well, Marguerite Moreau as the camp hottie is the only one in the whole cast doing any real acting. Everyone else, including David Hyde Pierce as a college professor and Janeane Garofolo as the camp director, are just mugging for the camera. Again, that results in some moments that are funny as hell, like Paul Rudd's portrayal of slothful adolescent defiance. But there are also moments that not just fall flat but fail to make any sense, like Garafolo riffing on Jewish surnames.Wet Hot American Summer is a bit like an entire episode of Saturday Night Live if every sketch were about summer camp. I don't mean a best of compilation. I mean a normal SNL episode where some of the sketches are good, some aren't and some leave you wondering what their point was.I must point out the DVD has a commentary track featuring Garafolo, Wain and Showalter that is much more consistently funny than the film itself. If you find the movie at all amusing, you'll love the commentary, and watching both makes Wet Hot American Summer worth renting.",Wet Hot American Summer
17,estebangonzalez10,Wet Hot Quirky Mess,5,30 July 2015,"""Hey, let's all promise that in ten years from today, we'll meet again, and we'll see what kind of people we've blossomed into.""Its been almost 15 years since David Wain's Wet Hot American Summer was released and I honestly had never heard of it. This was Wain's first feature film but it bombed at the box office and wasn't warmly received by critics either. Somehow over time it has become a cult teen comedy thanks to its wonderful cast, and now Netflix is about to release a comedy series with the same cast in the form of a prequel. The series will revolve around the first day of Summer camp in Camp Firewood in 1981, while this film focuses on the last day. The comedy plays out as a satire of camp films from the 80's and it honestly feels like a movie made in that period. The actors wear tight shirts, colorful short shorts, and long white tube socks with eighties hair styles. The look and style of the film itself is worth a couple of laughs and Wain's love and homage for these campy films transcends the screen. Unfortunately I didn't find much else worth recommending other than a couple of hilarious scenes, but as a whole I found the absurdist humor a bit lame. This is a very different comedy than what we are used to seeing and it's hard to point out any other film that has a similar style. That is why I believe it has become such a beloved cult comedy. Wet Hot American Summer is a parody in which you have no idea what direction the story is going to go and it constantly shifts its tone and introduces plenty of twists. Even though this film is basically a satire of camp films it doesn't miss the opportunity at gleefully playing with familiar genre conventions such as teen rom-coms and sport clichés. These individual scenes work extremely well but they don't make up a whole movie. That is why despite not being a fan of this film, I'm looking forward to the Netflix series because in shorter segments this could work well and the characters are worth revisiting.On the final day of Summer Camp there is still so much things to look forward to such as the camp director, Beth (Janeane Garofalo), falling for an astrophysics professor played by David Hyde Pierce. There is also a romantic triangle formed between camp counselors Coop (Michael Showalter), Katie (Marguerite Moreau), and Andy (Paul Rudd). Katie is worried about Coop not having hooked up with anyone during the Summer and she promises to help him find someone special for him before the end of the day. What she doesn't know is that Coop is in love with her, but she is currently dating Andy. Andy however doesn't seem to care too much for her since he cheats on her with Lindsay (Elizabeth Banks). Susie (Amy Poehler) and Ben (Bradley Cooper) are focused on directing a musical for the talent show later that night, while Gail (Molly Shannon) is struggling to teach her arts and crafts class because her husband has recently left her. Victor (Ken Marino) and Neil (Joe Lo Truglio) are in charge of taking another group of kids water rafting, but Victor is eager to get back to camp so he can make out with Abby (Marisa Ryan). This is just a small sample of the many activities that are taking place on this final day with plenty of surprises and twists along the way, including an innocent escape into the city by a group of counselors that degenerates into something crazy and unexpected.David Wain's most successful film to date is probably Role Models, but Wet Hot American Summer has been growing on people ever since. Paul Rudd has collaborated with Wain in all his films and here he plays a cocky and egocentric character to perfection. There isn't one main character, although if I was forced to pick one I'd say it is Michael Showalter's Coop which isn't really a surprise considering Michael co-wrote the screenplay with Wain. There are also some funny scenes involving the chef played by Christopher Meloni who is still suffering post traumatic stress disorder from the Vietnam War. The cast is fantastic here but there are so many characters that they don't actually get much screen time. Bradley Cooper is now an Oscar nominated actor, but this was his first film so he doesn't get much screen time. Marguerite Moreau was fantastic as well and it's a shame she hasn't really had much success after this. I recognized her from The Mighty Ducks franchise and it was fun to see her in a different role like this. The performances from this recognizable cast is probably the highlight of the film, but there are also several individual scenes that stand out such as the trip to the city and a hilarious motorcycle chase sequence. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Wet Hot American Summer
18,smatysia,Absolutely no redeeming features,2,14 February 2005,"What an awful movie. Okay, I understand that maybe I am not the target demographic for this film. And, while absurdity humor may not be my cup of tea, I can and do appreciate it when it is done well. Here, it was not. At all. This is just bad. I am surprised at all the raves I saw in the comments section. All right, everyone doesn't have to agree with me. I respect the opinions of others. But in my opinion, this movie sucks. Actually, I had never heard of it, and only taped it because I saw that Janeane Garofalo was top-billed. I remember thinking that she was so cute when she was on The Larry Sanders Show. Even though I know she is kind of loony, politically, I thought I would watch this film. Imagine my chagrin when, on top of a really bad movie, Miss Garofalo wasn't even very pretty anymore!

I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie has no comedy and no real story. Just a bunch of lame, shallow characters.

All the cliches and stereotypes are intact.  The clothes are ugly enough to be from the 70s.  The hair is too big. You are not assaulted with reminders that this is a period piece, although I did notice some of the dialogue seemed out of place - there should be some references to that time in which the movie takes place, like for example the expressions and slang that were popular at the time, but a lot of what the characters say sounds contemporary.  Not a big deal, but if the writers had rented teen/kids movies from the time - ""Smile"", ""The Bad News Bears"" and ""Little Darlings"" come to mind - or watched tv shows from that period, perhaps the movie would have felt more authentic.I laughed a couple of times but never got that feeling where the movie was good enough to just settle in and watch and know you are in capable hands. During something like this, I am sometimes unrelaxed, hoping for something great to happen to bring me over that hump that presents itself when the going gets rough, and the going was rough during 80% of this, for me. I just didn't think it was funny and by the end, it seemed like everyone just gave up and went for broke. Molly Shannon is an unfulfilled Arts-N-Craft teacher who is being coached by a male student, who she ends up with at the end. How that kid will ever top that in his career remains to be seen, and he's funny to start with, but it gets to be too much of what wasn't that great to begin with.  David Hyde Pierce, Paul Rudd and Christopher Meloni all waste their vast talent here. There is no nostalgic soundtrack, and I could have gotten a lot of enjoyment out of hearing something like ""No Matter What"" by Badfinger.

A complete flop when it originally came out (I don't even remember it being released), it has since garnered a significant cult following, so much so that Netflix commissioned a follow-up film nearly 10 years later, which hilariously is a prequel to the original film where the now much older cast is actually playing younger versions of themselves. But to this film in particular, the story revolves around a group of horny ""teen"" counselors on the last day of camp, the summer of 1981, wrapping up unfinished business before everyone leaves camp to go back home. The film is brilliant in it's recreation of movies like ""Meatballs,"" ""Hot Dog,"" ""Little Darlings,"" ""Up the Creek,"" or any other number of other 80s teen comedies that is so spot on that it almost seems like a straight up homage at times (whether it's the outfits, or the banter between senior counselors Garofalo and Hyde Pierce, to the camp PA announcements, and so on), but it also throws in some wildly absurd humor a well (a homicidal cook, the clearly non-teenage actors playing teen, and so on), but it all worked for me, mostly because of my love and nostalgia for all things 80s. This is a comedy that won't work for all tastes and the folks who made this film appear to have made a comedy to merely amuse themselves. So if you ""get it,"" this film is magic!

Luckily, the film is full of talent that, now at least, is recognized everywhere. The large ensemble and skittish nature of the film allow it to hit a few number of highs and completely bounce over any lows. It's obvious to see how such a film could reach cult status.

25,brando647,It Gets Funnier Every Time I Watch...,8,14 March 2016,"All right, so I'm getting the impression that writer/director David Wain is an acquired taste. I've had a rocky past with his movies; I thought ROLE MODELS was surprisingly fun but WANDERLUST was a major disappointment. I don't remember what it was that made me seek out his feature film debut but, after finally watching WET HOT American SUMMER, I've got a slightly better understanding of his style. The man thrives in absurdity and when it works, it works well. When it doesn't, it's almost frustrating (see: WANDERLUST). I was honestly surprised at how much fun I had with WET HOT American SUMMER. It's so incredibly stupid, but it's giddy, fun stupid. More importantly, as opposed to his 2012 hippie flop, everyone in this movie seems to be having just as much fun with the material as (hopefully) the audience. I'd seen reference to the movie before but never looked into it, assuming it was some low-key '80s screwball comedy that never got as much attention as the more popular movies of the time like MEATBALLS. I was more than a little surprised to find out this came out in 2001 and featured a cast including Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, David Hyde Pierce, Janeane Garofalo, Amy Poehler, Christopher Meloni, etc. So, Wain or no Wain, I figured I should at least give it a watch. It's set in 1981 on the last day of camp for Camp Firewood and everyone is rushing around tying up loose ends, sparking last minute summer romances, and planning for utter devastation in the form of a plummeting chunk of SkyLab.WET HOT American SUMMER is the very definition of a movie that requires you disengage your brain to enjoy. It's yet another movie that must've been written with the screenwriters, in this case David Wain and Michael Showalter, sitting in front of the page with a general idea of plot and plenty of ""Wouldn't it be hilarious if"" conversations. It's a parody of the usual summer camp hijinks film that finds the humor in recurring clichés and runs with it as far as it can go. There's the requisite summer love in Coop (Showalter) as he pines over the beautiful Katie (Marguerite Moreau) despite her too-cool-for-camp, serial cheating boyfriend Andy (Rudd) and in camp director Beth (Garofalo) when she falls for the neighboring associate professor Newman (Pierce). Victor (Ken Marino) plays the part of the dude desperate to get laid, forced to traverse through hell and back to accomplish his goal when he thinks he's got a chance. And it wouldn't be a summer camp comedy without the big talent show being produced by the tyrannical Sara (Poehler) and her soft-spoken lackey Ben (Cooper). That's assuming everyone survives, seeing as how Professor Newman and the nerdy kids have made a startling discovery that could lead to a disaster of ""Hindenberg level proportions"". You know, everything you would normally expect from a quirky tale of summer adventure. Maybe. Those were never my sort of movies.Humor is subjective so what works for me may or may not work for you. I can think of many people who wouldn't get ten minutes into WET HOT American SUMMER before turning it off in disgust, either from the occasional darker humor or the frequent absurd nonsense. All I can say is, it worked for me. I laughed more than I expected and I was left with a better understanding of what Wain might've been trying to accomplish with WANDERLUST. Both movies are nothing more than a series of gags and characters that may as well be two-dimensional cartoons but, where WANDERLUST failed because it felt mean-spirited and populated with unlikeable characters, this movie is the polar opposite and succeeds in my book. And because the movie is full of non sequitur humor and bizarre absurdity, it's actually pretty re-watchable because you'll usually find some joke or visual gag you might've missed on previous viewings. I wish I could come up with a viable movie comparison to give you some idea what to expect and help you decide whether it's worth your time, but I'm coming up blank. Give it a go. If you hate it, you're probably not alone. If you like it, well, welcome to Camp Firewood. Some personal highlights to close this out: Christopher Meloni's performance as the camp's cook, Vietnam vet Gene, provides some of the funniest moments in the film and just about any scene with David Hyde Pierce explaining ""science"" (especially in the final act).",Wet Hot American Summer
26,pyrocitor,Smells like teen spirit or is that the refried beans?,8,28 July 2015,"""Not ANOTHER 'Another Teen Movie,'"" is the accompanying groan to most introductions to Wet Hot American Summer. How could a title and premise that simultaneously stupid and generic be anything more than the sum of its exorbitantly familiar parts? It doesn't help that every plot summary reads roughly exactly how you'd expect it to; even stray quotations out of context play like recycled outtakes from American Pie. If anything, it seems amazing how barefaced the film is about its complete unoriginality. So do yourself a favour – stop reading plot summaries, perusing online quotes, and just go see the film instead. Don't watch the trailer. Even stop reading this review. Stop it. Please stop.What are you doing still reading? I asked you nicely and everything! I have failed at my objective.The inevitable twist, of course: all of the above claims are actually true. And yet, somehow, Wet Hot American Summer remains an almost uncomfortably enjoyable watch. This is a film that gleefully tries to hide how far-removed from the film you think it's going to be, patiently wearing the mask of a normal 'Murrcan teenage coming-of-age camp drama, filled with first kisses, first times, illicit substances, and plenty of second-hand embarrassment. Don't get me wrong: those things are all still there. But the schmaltz of the standard framework has been jettisoned for something altogether livelier, funnier, and even more honest. 'Parody' is the term used to encompass the film's approach to genre, but it may as well function as a parody of expectations of normal narrative beats and cohesion. It's almost as if writer/director David Wain and writer/star Michael Showalter have tossed a pinch of magic (or at least 'special sauce') into the pressure cooker of rote garbage and let it rip with no lid, exploding everywhere in a mess too delicious to be turned down (or something I think that metaphor got away from me). The best joke of all? It works. Weirdly well. No, this is a film whose heart and inspiration lies somewhere between the SNL-spin off insanity of Meatballs and National Lampoon, blended with a healthy helping of the surrealistic insanity of Monty Python, and culminating in just enough heartfelt personal experience to feel strangely honest, in spite of the trappings. Narratively, it plays like a collection of improv sketches with only a rough template to eventually veer back to – an Anchorman before Anchorman, if you will. Wain and Showalter take as much pleasure in making you fall in love with their earnest, archetypal characters, as they do pulling the rug out from what you would traditionally expect or even want to happen to them. Zaniness abounds, but somehow, by pushing the tropes to hyperbolic, with a side helping of irreverent and insane, ye olde teenage love subplot clichés feel far more heartfelt and credible than they would in the far flashier and stupider films that birthed them. Like any good comedy, this is a film that establishes its own internal world of conventions and possibilities. Yes, this is a world where Paul Rudd, upon finding out that, due to his negligence as a lifeguard, one of his campers has drowned, responds by offhandedly disposing of the witness and we're expected to laugh. And if laugh you do, the film's got another one for ya. Some of the bits are shrewder satirical genius (the ""into town"" sequence hysterically lampoons every parent's stern lectures about the escalation of substance use), but the film steadily gives in to being willfully deranged, building to a finale so ridiculous it feels like the apex of a drug tripand, thus, entirely appropriate. In many ways, the film's biggest gag is its oddly prophetic assembly of actors who would go on to become comedic superstars, and an extra level of hilarity is derived from watching them irreverently having a blast here. Rudd steals the show, exquisitely uncompromising as the camp's resident pretty-boy-dirtbag, but Amy Poehler is a close second, perfecting her routine personas as both earnestly inspirational and ferocious control freak. Bradley 'blink-and-you- might-recognize-him' Cooper, of all people, ends up headlining a romantic subplot that leads to the most unexpectedly tender moments of the film, while Christopher Meloni unabashedly steals every scene he appears in, a comedic triumph as the camp's shellshocked cook. Janeanne Garofalo and David Hyde-Pierce are both brilliantly in their element, blending sardonic barbs and rambling sweetness, as the camp's director and resident astrophysicist respectively, while Showalter himself is adorably fumbling as the lovestruck nerd (alongside a surprise cameo appearance) and Marguerite Moreau delivers some of the film's most incredibly acerbic dialogue while impressively never dropping her beaming smile. Molly Shannon uncorks a hysterically belligerent meltdown like none other, and Elizabeth Banks is hilariously dopey as one of the camp's seemingly endless slew of nymphomaniacs (go figure). Comedy this bonkers is certainly not for all tastes, but it's worth at least conceding which tastes the film should appeal to, which the film's latent cult success should attest to. Ultimately, in Wet Hot American Summer, coherence doesn't really matter: like an appropriately wild party, by the end of the film, it's hard to remember who was involved in which subplot, and who's kissed who, until you realize it hardly matters, and to just go along with the ride, and leave with Jefferson Starship's ""Jane"" still pounding in your head. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hump the refrigerator. -8/10",Wet Hot American Summer

At a time when the classics of ZAZ and Mel Brooks were making way for The Wayans Brothers and Seltzerbergs, Wet Hot American Summer had more focus and a more competent feel in comparison to the movies of a similar ilk released at the time(looking at you scary movie). While I appreciated the craft and obvious love for their satirical topic, the fact they've chosen to spoof 80s teen sex romps seems like an uphill battle because how does one spoof a comedy? Granted the 80s sex romps satirized like Porky's or Meatballs had a set in stone formula with characters who were seldom given development beyond one or two characteristics, but because those movies were never taken seriously it makes the whole concept of a satire feel kind of pointless. With that said there is love for the material satirized in the same way Spaceballs spoofed sci-fi or Hot Shots! spoofed action films, and the cast with the likes of Paul Rudd, Amy Poelher, David Hyde Pierce, and H. Jon Benjamin(in a small but VERY funny bit part) all bring their A-Game with good chemistry and timing.

People who enjoy humor more in line with the Farelly Brothers or the ""American Pie"" films probably just won't ""get this."" It's all a matter of taste and your sense of humor. But seriously, how can you go wrong with a movie that has a pep talk from a talking can of vegetables or an overly dramatic chase scene where the person doing the chasing is thwarted by a single barrel of hay in the middle of a wide open road? My personal favorite is when the guy is driving the van singing along to ""Danny's Song"" and then out of nowhere screams bloody murder as he slams into a tree. Oh, and who can forget the hilariously rapid decent into the underworld of drugs and despair by the kids spending an hour away from camp in town? This is also a must see for people who appreciate Janeane Garafalo's comic timing and Molly Shannon's bizarre brand of humor.

32,dr_foreman,I feel old.,4,16 August 2006,"I always feel like an old man when I watch modern comedies. I tend to look in vain for dated, old-fashioned, superannuated little things like a proper plot, sympathetic characters, and - dare I admit this? - a dash of sentiment. And I'm always disappointed. So I feel old, like, you know, someone who'd rather be watching a black-and-white comedy such as ""Horse Feathers"" for the hundredth time.Unfortunately, the whole point of most modern comedies is that they don't have any sentiment. Or plots. Or characters. Basically, people in movies like ""Wet Hot American Summer"" meander around embarrassing themselves in ways that are, I suppose, hilarious. As you might expect, there are plenty of references to bodily functions, STDs, and substance abuse, and of course there's heaps of juvenile sexual innuendo. (But, alas, no actual hot sex. The title's just a tease, ain't it?) I'll give you an example of what's supposed to be hilarious here. One of the kids at the camp plays Dungeons and Dragons, and so - get this - he walks around in a cape! And, of course, he makes references to things like a ""level five charm spell"" in the middle of casual conversations.

Why not mine that rich vein of humor potential, rather than go for a lazy sight gag/stereotype? I feel strange, trying to analyze this stuff.

I know because I grew up in the great decade of the 80's!!
This was more 70's than anything and not at all funny!! Parody or not, this movie is a total let down!! Counselors Treating the kids like Paul Rudd did was overrated!! If that would have happened, that person would have been fired at best, if not been facing charges for not jumping in to save the kid!! Throwing the kid out of the van!!!
They buy a ""brick"" of cocaine when they go into town scene. Those kids would not have the combined money to buy that!! They would have came with pot at best because the actual head of the camp would know they were on something other than pot!! They would have been sent home or handed over to the police because of the kids!! Those kids parents would have had that camp shut down long before if actual drugs were known to be there!! Don't get me started on them shaking after using the drugs!!
Hippies were a thing of the past by 81!!! No one was wearing bell bottoms in 81 & the cure was not actually known in the states in 81 as the ""goth"" girls shirt wouldn't have been until 84-86!!!
Nothing against gays because I'm friends with gay people but in the 70's/early 80's, that was still taboo!! When the guys found out about gays, they would have stomped the gays or the head of the camp would send them home to never return instead of performing a ceremony!!!
I thought seeing Christopher in this that he would be funny like he was in H & K Go To White Castle, but instead, he was stupid and vulgar!! Humping a fridge, come on!!!

Barf.I think if you get really wasted you can sit through this garbage until a funny scene comes up for 4 seconds 20 minutes later.... that's what you will need pretty much because the laughs in the movie are SCANT, the plot is tiresome and retarded. A few moments are unique with 80s humor- that's pretty cool- but really- the majority of this is SO unwatchable it's insurmountably painful to the gonads in a sharp piercing manner to try and sit through this idiotic attempt at a comedy. I wish the writers were forced to hold their breath underwater in between funny scenes- they all would have died.",Wet Hot American Summer

I was IN SHOCK... and that takes a LOT, being a Music Industry Exec... I did NOT expect that from this movie!

40,michaelradny,The Cult Classic,7,8 August 2015,"Wet Hot American Summer may well be the greatest comedy cult classic ever made and upon viewing, I can see why. This film is hilarious, though obviously people will have mixed feelings about it. The comedy is great if you get it, bland if you don't. Sometimes it's slow and boring, but most of the time fun and entertaining. Great fun for most people. Probably the most weirdly paced film I have ever seen. In fact it may be the strangest way to make comedy, but hell is it effective. Wet Hot American Summer proves that it can stand up against the greats of all time, and with its prequel TV show out, hopefully the following can grow in magnitude and make a staple for the form of comedy.",Wet Hot American Summer
41,tnrcooper,"Entertaining, sometimes self-conscious parody of summer camp films",8,13 June 2010,"You either love or find this film goofy. I don't think there's room for too many other opinions. Some people, like many fans of Monty Python, swear by this film, while others, also like many people regarding Monty Python, just regard it as bizarre.Personally I found it very entertaining. There are lots of fantastic comic performances here, from Janeane Garofalo to Molly Shannon, from Paul Rudd to David Hyde Pierce, and from Christopher Meloni as you've never seen him, to Michael Showalter. Garofalo, for my money, deserves the greatest props. Her depiction of geeky camp director Beth is excellent and captures the disinterestedness, passion, yearning, and tenderness which her character, who falls for a nerdy and slightly maladjusted astro-physicist named Henry Newman, played with such comic agility by David Hyde Pierce, suggests. Christopher Meloni as a Vietnam vet named Gene serving as camp cook steals every scene with his fixation on his wartime experiences. Michael Showalter is great as a nice, nerdy boy who doesn't appreciate just how much his niceness is limiting him from attracting girls. His scenes with Meloni are hilarious. Paul Rudd is great as Andy, a good looking, shallow guy who is focused on one thing and one thing only and is a complete azz. Kate (Marguerite Moreau) is his female counterpart, a sixteen-year-old girl who knows that she's being shallow but really doesn't care and just wants to get laid. Molly Shannon is quite funny as a woman who has recently broken up with her ex and is trying to resist the urge to abase herself and crawl back to him. She is helped hilariously by some of her camping wards.There are lots of funny scenes here. If you enjoyed ""The State""-well, you've probably seen it because this film came out nine years ago and The State was on TV around that time-but if you somehow missed it in '01, you'd probably enjoy it. The humor is somewhat nerdy-this is humor for nerds who like humor-and I say that with no shame, but it is what it is. The film takes on stereotypes from '80s camping films (the ditzy easy girl, the buff brain-dead boy, the nerdy camp director, all the now goofy-looking fashion, the casual drug use, and the campers' ability to solve pressing problems with great ease) and wildly mocks them. Most I found quite funny, as a humor nerd myself, although a couple (the drug use parody just didn't strike me as funny and Gene's attempt to face who he was also didn't particularly tickle me) I thought came up short.That said, this is an awful lot of fun. The ensemble cast is very talented, it's obvious that the cast is not in this film for the paycheck, and they have a lot of fun mocking the old summer camp chestnuts.",Wet Hot American Summer
42,Hallelujah289,My new favorite,8,25 September 2019,"Wet Hot American Summer is a goofy, surreal, romp of a film that has very lovable and very dumb characters. It's a cast of losers and hot chicks and hot guys at an 80s summer camp, trying to find love or friendship, or just trying to score because let's be honest, they're just 16.The relationship between the camp director and the astrophysicist next door who has crabs is particularly endearing, because of their nerdy sincerity with each other. I was rooting for their romance.Wet Hot American Summer has a loose story structure with an improvisational feel, almost episodic. it does meander, but I enjoyed many of the characters and what they brought, and it overall worked for me. It was fun seeing young Bradley Cooper and Amy Poehler and etc. Molly Shannon did not disappoint as a brokenhearted activities teacher.Wet Hot American Summer does have an insight to itself, with the hot characters reflecting on their state of mind, like Paul Rudd saying he doesn't love his girlfriend but she's incredibly hot, so he isn't going to give her up to the nerd character. Kudos to the writers.Wet Hot American Summer is also unusually supportive of gay and lesbian characters, for a film of this period (2001). Two jocks end up buying Bradley Cooper and his boyfriend a chaise lounge to go with their other furniture. Elizabeth Banks makes out with a hot girl and tells Paul Rudd off, who had rejected her.I like this funny, smart, ridiculous film.",Wet Hot American Summer
43,Mr_Censored,A No-Holds-Barred Cult Classic.,9,7 January 2010,"A gay marriage in the woods, the confessions of canned vegetables, a drug-induced day-trip to a local town, multiple children drowning and a talent show are just some of the events that make up the day-in-the-life of 2001's ""Wet Hot American Summer."" Written and directed by alumni of MTV's mid-90's sketch comedy show ""The State,"" the film is host to one of the best ensemble casts a comedy has seen in at least a decade and an off-beat sense of humor that has solidified its status as a cult classic.The film takes place at a fictional summer camp in Maine in 1981. It's the last day of camp, and everyone is scrambling to find love and lust. Throughout the film, we follow an array of wacky and zany characters, brought to life by such talent as David Hyde Pierce, Christopher Meloni, Janeane Garofalo, Bradley Cooper, Molly Shannon, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks, Michael Ian Black and Marguerite Moreau. Meloni plays against his ""Law & Order"" type and gets some of the biggest laughs of the show, but Rudd isn't far behind with his apathetic and child-like performance. The writing is as off-the-wall as expected, with the plot taking left-turns at unexpected points, giving way to gigantic laughs from bizarre situations and ridiculous sight-gags.The film wasn't very successful upon its release, and most critics hated it, but over time, it has earned its spot as one of best comedies of the decade and is a testament to the power of comedy when it is without restraint or reservation. In short, it's a coming of age movie that can double as a stoner flick. Watch it without any pretensions and just enjoy the wild day that you'll want to re-live again and again.",Wet Hot American Summer
44,BigGuy,Not funny,2,24 January 2002,"This movie just failed.  At first it seemed like it was supposed to be a straight spoof, then at times an over-the-top spoof (like Airplane), and sometimes like comedy in its own right.  The thing that tied all the aspects together was that it was just not funny.  The jokes were all very flat. The jokes that weren't predictable were contrived, especially the ending which was a long tedious attempt to get a string of jokes in.  The only joke is on the person watching.",Wet Hot American Summer

I would expect a 7 to 8 rating. The first time I saw this, I really didn't know what to think.  I understood that there were jokes, but I just didn't seem to think it was all that funny.  Certain sequences worked well, but overall, there seemed to be something wrong. There really isn't.  The movie is absolutely great, but it requires about two or three watches before getting into it.  Once it reaches that point, this is about as good as camp movies get (my personal exception being Poison Ivy).  The humor in this movie is unusual.  It's both subtle and overstated, and as a result, it alienates a lot of people until they get used to placing jokes in their proper place. If you watch it a few more times - preferably with some friends, when you're all in a good mood - then you'll probably grow quite a bit more fond of the film.",Wet Hot American Summer

That's the best way to describe it. This is a film that starts off normal until it slowly goes off the rails to the point you can't remem what it was originally about. Wet Hot American Summer is a cult gem in comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, mixed slap stick comedy with absolutely ridiculousness in order to garner a laugh and I love it for that.

48,noizyme,Great directing of a nostalgic camp movie,8,8 January 2005,"Dvaid Wain knows his comedy. He was known as the director of this movie as well as a bit actor in shows like the 90's great MTV show ""The State"" and as a correspondent on Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show."" This creation was his view of old 80's camp movies, but it was filmed in 2001. Fans of ""The State"" will recognize old favorite actors like Michael Ian Black, Kerri Kenney (also from Reno 911), Joe Lo Truglio, Ken Marino, Michael Showalter, and a short cameo from the director himself.Janeane Garofalo plays the type-casted role of woman-without-love, but of course, she's funny as hell as a camp director and hot in that comedian who-doesn't-give-a-crap kind of way. (I've got a thing for her) She's always pretty sweet to watch, and I loved how her character included all the kids. David Hyde Pierce from Frasier is here, playing the love interest of Garofalo's and a scientist who teaches the camp-goers about science stuff. I love his scene with the kids when he tells them that he's not really a professor and they have a good cry.The great thing about this movie is that it focuses on the camp counselors and director instead of the kids. It wasn't like that Nickelodeon show ""Salute Your Shorts"" or anything. It basically took classic shots (like back in 80's films) and put the scenes into a hilarious sequence that became the movie. Great and funny all the way through.",Wet Hot American Summer
49,billybrown41,"why the term ""instant classic"" was invented",10,20 June 2003,"This movie is not funny.  It's Friggin' HILARIOUS.  The first time I watched it was during the winter and I laughed a few times, but remembering the motorcycle chase scene, I gave it another run and was blown away.  I haven't laughed so hard since the second time I saw ""The Big Lebowski"" and I ended up buying my own copy.  What is it about Summer Camp movies?  Is it nostalgia or what?  I'm really not sure. I've always had a weakness for them, but this tops all. Ironically, it's a parody of nearly every Summer Camp movie out there and it covers many, MANY other topics that I'm just too lazy to ruin for you. It's also better than just about any other Summer Camp movie out there, and despite all the absurdity going on, it actually does a good job of catching that feeling of being at camp.  There's not much more I can say about this one without ruining most of the jokes, but I can say that if you want a comedy that's actually funny, then don't rent this.  BUY IT.  Watch it at least once a month for the rest of your life (once a week during the Summer) and encourage your friends to do the same.  This is why the term ""instant classic"" was invented.",Wet Hot American Summer
50,kylehodgdon,"Take A Second Look, It Is Not That Good",5,15 November 2009,"I didn't like, nor did I dislike this movie. I heard about it through several of my friends, all of whom really enjoyed it, but I just don't see it.The plot could have been a lot better. This is a movie where they tried to have a plot where nothing happens, yet everything happens, but I think that the execution came off as cluttered and jumbled. I was not interested in any of the characters and just found myself to be losing interest in the overall film.The humor all fell flat as well. I don't think I laughed one time. Going into the film I knew the line ""You taste like a burger"" was coming because my friends used to joke about it. I knew it was coming and was all ready to laugh, however when it did I just thought it did not come off as well as it could have. I hate Janeane Garofalo and I don't think she could ever seem funny to me. Furthermore, she's a terrible actress. As much as there is wrong in this movie, I guess it is not terrible.

51,hippiedj,Good clean raunchy fun for everyone...and lots of swimming!,9,3 February 2002,"Not since Psycho Beach Party was I so pleasantly surprised by a film that was capable of parodying a genre in such a smart way. While Wet Hot American Summer has fun with all the clichés of those drive-in R-rated Meatballs ripoffs, it does something I haven't seen before: it allows EVERYONE to enjoy the show whether male or female, gay or straight. Those other films were mostly aimed at guys so they could have an excuse to see a bunch of naked gals in the guise of a ""legitimate"" film. Instead of doing that, Wet Hot American Summer has fun with all the intentions and absurd situations without resorting to throwing in naked girls every ten minutes-- simply making this a breast fest would have been too easy. There isn't one bit of nudity in WHAS. You want nudity? Then watch the outtakes on the DVD and you'll see some funny male nudity for a change. This film relies on its creativity for laughs and that counts for a lot. There's a lot of talk about sex and lots of frenching, but it never needs to go ""all the way"" which is why I think films like Fast Times At Ridgemont High weren't as fulfilling.Given, the language is heavy (even in many scenes where little kids are present), but it adds to the warped world that this camp is a part of. Even the over-the-top ""trip to town"" drug binge montage was so exaggerated that it may not have actually happened because later one camp counselor says they went into town and had ice cream and hot dogs! It's true, this film has everything...as director David Swain says ""It has lots of swimming, bikinis, gay sex, explosions, some nerds, and something for everybody."" It also takes a bold direction in the fact that while including homosexuality in the humor, it doesn't aim for cheap shots. Plus, it's about time gay males were portrayed more positively like in this story and more mainstream films should get away from the increasingly tired gratuitous lesbian love scenes.I'm partial to this film too because I am the age the camp counselors would be now (the film is set in 1981), and it takes me back to a time when kids were just wilder in different ways before home computers and MTV messed up teens even more. This is a film that gives us folk over the age of 30 something to enjoy; I know I'm quite OVER the gross-out humor of most films aimed at the ""Girls Gone Wild"" demographic. Even the DVD's ""alternate soundtrack with extra farts"" was just so bizarre of an idea that it doesn't come off as completely juvenile.Granted, this film isn't for all tastes. You don't have to be a fan of the comedy group The State (of which this stems from to an extent), but to appreciate it it does take a fondness for the time it pays homage to and the somewhat contextual sense of humor it conveys. No doubt some viewers (particularly the young'ns) will be scratching their heads at some references but I found myself at least smiling in fond recognition when I wasn't laughing. Once you get settled in to the absurdity, the film starts to rapidly get more and more outrageous.The attention to period detail is fun -- from the clothes and hair to the music and cars. Even the film's cover art is a tribute to those kind that looked like a Mad or Cracked Magazine cover drawing, giving it an added feel that this film could have actually come from 20 years ago. The cast is extremely fun. Janeane Garofalo is always fine as usual, Molly Shannon shines when getting marital advice from pre-teens, and -- Wow! -- you will not recognize Christopher Meloni with that beard! Or, it's because you'll be distracted by his exposed tummy from wearing a half-shirt through most of the film! The whole subplot of his own sexual identity discovery is played out in the most unusual way I've ever seen in any type of film for sure. Michael Showalter has the art of geekiness down pact, and I always love to see Amy Poehler improvising. David Hyde Pierce is always likable (he should keep the moustache too!), and the kids are all great and in some cases much more mature emotionally than the camp counselors! Paul Rudd....hmmm, you just want to smack his character but he's still so cool you laugh at his antics.It's a BIG shame that so many processed ""comedies"" like Slackers get all the promotion and screen time while genuine finds like Wet Hot American Summer have to find their audience in a harder way. This is a long span of time from Meatballs or even Little Darlings, but it is sure nice to revisit that era with this genuine surprise of a comedy. I took a chance on buying this without having seen it before, and it sure brightened my day. I haven't had an outrageous comedy give me such a satisfying smile since Overnight Delivery (another Paul Rudd comedy that deserved recognition).

It's incredibly bizarre and strange, but it balances the normal scenes and the bizarre and weird scenes pretty terribly. For maybe the first half of the movie it feels like a normal, silly R-rated comedy (for the most part). Then, kind of out of nowhere, it slams all the weirdness and utterly ridiculous stuff into your face. It's rather jarring and really confusing. That being said, some scenes were just so strange that I couldn't help but laugh at them. So, we have this movie that is overall fairly bad, but it does make you laugh on occasion. I can't really call it a great movie, as I feel like every laugh the movie gets was gotten by the filmmakers just throwing silly stuff on the screen. That's not the hardest thing to do.

55,KyleLicht,The Greatest Comedy,10,17 August 2020,"This is probably my favorite comedy film of all-time and sits at number 26 on my Top 100 Films list. I've talked about this film so much, I don't know what else to say. At some point I will do a full analysis of it. But, for right now, here are my summarized thoughts.This is the perfect absurdist comedy film. It serves as a parody/satire of typical summer camp/teen comedies. It plays on every trope and makes fun of itself from music to editing to acting to plot to sound editing, etc. There are misplaced pottery shattering sounds, semantic humor (my favorite humor) like ""Thank you Henry"" ""No please, call me Henry"", ironic trite plot points, fourth-wall breaks, intentional plotholes, painfully obvious stunt doubles, cartoon physics, and a lot of comedy pioneering with the invention of the slow clap.
Overall, it's surprisingly progressive in its mockery. It has a beautiful homosexual sex scene and the homophobia of characters is only a subversion of typical character behaviors to show a complete acceptance and normalization of homosexuality. Also, it heavily mocks the ideals of dating and romance. Many characters are heavily-sex driven and a large theme is finding romance or sex on the last day of camp. It makes fun of the character who needs to justify his masculinity with his body count or the virgin who desperately wants to have sex to fit in. It also breaks the stereotype of the sex-crazy male by showing a romantic male lead who is interested in sex secondarily, but primarily is fueled by love and genuine interest in personality and character. It also breaks the stereotype of slut-shaming by showing a highly promiscuous woman who unabashedly goes after what she wants and without judgement from her peers: sex. Lastly, it shatters the idea of the male fantasy beautifully in the end, by subverting what we expect the male characters to earn in the end, whether it's getting the girl or getting what they want. There are powerful female characters, vulnerable male characters, and a normalization of differences whether it's gay vs. straight or jock vs. nerd or rich vs. poor.
I would highly recommend this film to anyone. I've seen it probably ten times and every time, I find something new and find myself laughing out loud. It's stupid, yet one of the most intelligent comedies I've seen, and that's why I love it.",Wet Hot American Summer

I grew up in the 1980's and like everyone else who has grown up in that era, have seen every 80's teen and summer camp movie out there. So I couldn't wait to see this movie that totally spoofs that film genre. What a disappointment!! The movie was nothing but a bunch of really bad jokes and gags over and over, with hardly any plot and no substance. And the filmmakers attempts at dark humor totally failed-some of these so-called jokes didn't come across as anything but downright cruel and offensive. The only good things about this film were the wardrobe, music, and acting. It was nice to go on a nostalgia trip and see all of the summer clothing styles from the 80's, and the same goes for the music.

Far from serious or even sane, those who don't like ""stupid"" movies will probably not find anything special here. However, if you do, then you'll find this ridiculously hilarious.This had to have been a joy to make. Talking soup cans, fridge-humping chefs, hardcore drug binges, and interesting student/teacher relationships give it more than enough material to crack a few smiles from the makers during filming. It's so random and aware of it's jokes and what it is that it's hard for me not to like. It never takes itself seriously and the viewer shouldn't either. It's a perfectly absurd party movie....and shouldn't be taken as anything else. If you do, then that's your problem and fault for not being able to enjoy this film.

63,TelevisionJunkie,"Uneven, but not without its moments",7,11 January 2006,"I'm still not sure what to make of this one. ""Wet Hot American Summer"" chronicles the final day of summer camp in 1981. Knowing that premise, and knowing that it was a quasi-reunion of the comedy troupe from ""The State"" (which aired on MTV a decade ago, and once on CBS), I was expecting a ""Dazed and Confused"" spoof of the '80s ""Meatballs""-type camp flicks. Instead of spoofing those films, it's like one of them  the fact that it takes place in '81 is only incidental.The cast is broad, diverse and they have incredible chemistry. I feel the need to say this because without all of the big and small-screen players, the script would not have worked at all. Some of the scenes and characters are consistently funny. Paul Rudd, for example, gives one of his funniest performances ever as a horny counselor who's too busy playing tongue-tag with beautiful girls to care about the safety of the campers (and what he does to two campers who know too much is absolutely riotous!). Other characters get off to a good start, then collapse under silliness. Ken Marino as the smooth-talking stud who's really a virgin, chews the scenery at first  but his storyline ultimately fades to utter stupidity (and he's noticeably absent for a good chunk of the film). And then there's Chris Meloni as the Vietnam vet turned camp cook, and Molly Shannon as the whiny divorcée art director. Both actors have a few funny lines (though Meloni's funniest scenes, where he berates a camper about corn, were cut out) but there's a lot of total stupidity to their parts.Despite the film's shortcomings, I was completely with it for the first hour. There were a few times when I thought, ""this is inane,"" but something funny was waiting in the next scene. In the last half hour though, it loses all point and direction, collapsing under the weight of a lot of overlong, unfunny skits, beginning when camp counselor Janeane Garofolo pointlessly destroys the nurse's office.

64,aquascape,The last day of summer,7,27 March 2018,"""Wet Hot American Summer"" turned out to be a guilty pleasure movie that scooped up more than a few laughs.Starring many actors and actresses that would go on to become successful, the movie proved to be a good launch pad but not to the point of them getting typecast.The plot revolves around the last day of summer camp in 1981 and it treats the subjects of teen years, puberty and sexual situation in a satirical way.
While some scenes do seems a bit over-the-top and yes, this includes the famous Bradley Cooper and Michael Ian Black scene, others are just plain clever and remind us of a certain time where screwball satire was at it's peak, the times of Brooks, Abrahams and Zucker.""Wet Hot American Summer"" definitely gained fame over the years, becoming a cult movie and an easy watch with no reservations.",Wet Hot American Summer

Porky's and American Pie , though gross, each have something to say about youth and sex. This movie says nothing. Even Meatballs is better.

68,fullonrobotchubby,May go over your head the first time... so see it again!,9,23 June 2005,"I remember laughing at movie spoofs such as Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie the first time I watched them, but lately repeat viewings have annoyed me more and more. I can see the jokes coming a mile away and, in all honesty, could see them coming the first time I saw them and laughed confidently, proud of myself for predicting the direction of the humor. These days, I don't feel so special for predicting the obvious. The makers of Wet Hot American Summer probably felt the same way and crafted a brilliant movie (with an obviously limited budget) as a result. This movie takes you on a roller coaster ride, most often going the complete opposite direction of your expectations. With each setup, you never know if the punchline you are about to see is a play on cliché 80s teen comedy characters, an example of perfectly executed (read: smart) bathroom humor, an excuse to make a can talk, or what. Like many movies in the age of DVD I consider to be underrated and brilliant films (Fight Club, The Big Lebowski, Shaolin Soccer, etc.), Wet Hot American Summer may require repeat viewings to catch much of the subtly crafted spoof humor. Especially careful eyes should watch the performances of Garafolo, Hyde Pierce, and Showalter; every inch of every move and delivered line they make is knitted in golden self-aware comedy fabric. With two of the cast members (one of them a co-writer) and the director (the other co-writer) of this film appearing in their own Comedy Central show ""Stella"" soon, there's no better time to watch Wet Hot American Summer than the summer of '05. Also watch Paul Rudd perform smart stupid comedy three years (!) before he was Brian Fantana. This movie is like a hip inside joke you just gotta be in on.",Wet Hot American Summer

While we didn't have men or boys at camp, we did have weird, freaky, and hilarious times at camp. I loved this movie...although parts weren't as good as others. I have either worked, dated, hired, fired or known people like most of the characters in this movie, as most of have.Paul Rudd's character, IS FANTASTIC.

This movie is hilarious, but you need to invest some time in it. It starts off a little slow, but gets progressively more bizarre and funny as it goes. It seems to be a parody of early 80's summer camp movies, which I'm sure is what the movie studio wanted. As the film progresses, however, it throws more curveballs and twisted lines than you can handle! Janeane Garafalo and David Hyde Pierce play the straights of the movie, with Mike Showalter (""I'm outta' heeeeeere""), Michael Ian Black (Johnny Blue Jeans), Ken Marino (""I'm gonna' dip my balls in it"") and Joe LoTruglio whipping out the great ""State"" humor. It's directed by ""State"" founder David Wain. Even Kerri Kenney (the former Mrs. Laupin) makes a cameo in the deleted scenes. The rest of the cast also helps to build this film to a comic frenzy, especially Chris Meloni's with his portrayal of crazed Viet Nam vet/camp cook Gene.

73,Parca,A mixed bag...,5,3 February 2002,"This movie suffers from an uneven use of humor.  At times (particularly in the first half) it just recreates the summer camp movies of the early 80s, without really inserting many jokes, and expects it to be funny as is, because it is showing you how stupid these movies were.  Unfortunately, by hardly twisting the genre, it just winds up as another stupid summer camp movie.  About half-way through it changes - somewhat.  First, it starts introducing unexpected bizarre scenes (e.g. the trip to the city). Secondly, it at last starts making fun of the conventions of those films (e.g. the only sex scene is a gay sex scene; the slutty advisor goes way overboard with who she picks as her partner-of-the-moment; the kids unexpectedly boo a horrible talent show piece in which the participants had made a great effort; nobody wants to play the great underdog sports event; and the ending perfectly skewers the ""nice geeky guy wins the girl of his dreams back from her jerk boyfriend"" ending).  But a lot of the jokes fail or come off as too weak.  And many storylines are brought back only for the reason that they are threads left hanging around, and not because the writers had anything inspiring to do with them.  The movie doesn't really end - it just pretty much stops.  Then again, it doesn't have a real beginning of a story (something which disorients you at first).The best that can be said is that the actors involved did their best effort. However, the writing and directing were not up to par.  Don't believe the hype of this being a ""hidden gem"".  It's more of a nice-looking cheap rock, and the only discovery that you will make will be when you find it to be a decent time killer when you run into it on cable one afternoon and have nothing else to watch.",Wet Hot American Summer
74,LawnBoy-4,The pinnacle of Unfunny,1,5 February 2018,"Yeah, I get it. They were attempting to create a spoof/parody of 70s/80s camp films. Done properly, this could have been a comedic classic. As it stands, the writers were apparently convinced that cornball ""humor"" and supposedly satirical and overt stereotypes were enough to appeal to the masses on the basis of forced ""irony"" and quasi-esoteric inside jokes. What a mess.The first thing that should have tipped me off that this would ultimately prove to be a complete waste of my time was the inclusion of Michael Ian Black, who is mostly known for an appalling bevy of failed, tragically unfunny Comedy Central shows. Try as he might, Black is could not be funny if his life depended on it, which is a shame because I honestly want to like the guy. Aside from Black, the film boasts a sizable number of actors/comedians who would ultimately move on to greater things. Then again, graduating to public access TV would constitute ""moving on to greater things"" after appearing in this abomination.There really is nothing at all to like about this movie, at least for me. Sure, there are fanboys out there who will tell you that you ""just don't get it"", as if hidden beneath the tepid ooze lies some masterful form of comic genius.

Pierce in particular is just outstanding with farce and physical humour. Both are cast against type and the result is not successful.

People who came of age in the early eighties ( like me ) may get more of the jokes, but the movie is great all the way through.  The cast is impeccable, the writing is spot on, and a much neglected era is brought to life convincingly.  Many jokes start out as the same old predictable stuff but get turned on their heads.  Watch until the very end of the credits for one of the funniest jokes I have ever seen on film; it's worth the price of admission for that alone.

77,nikhil_kamra,Wet Hot American Disappointment :(,3,20 September 2016,"I heard last year that a mini series aired on Netflix which acted as a prequel to this ""cult classic"". I checked the stellar cast in this movie and needless to say, I was instantly drawn. So I added this to my watchlist.I found time to watch this movie yesterday and I was disappointed to say the least. All these great actors, who now, well after a decade have achieved greatness in their careers; I was astonished to find that they starred in this embarrassingly unfunny satire. And believe me, I've watched my fair share of stupid movies, dark comedies, spoofs, satires, stoner comedies, etc. and I've liked them for what they were. But I couldn't bring myself to liking this.Let's get down to it. So, it starts off okay, but then it descends to being a dull movie. And by the mid act, I was annoyed at myself for watching this crap. But I have this habit (call it an OCD) of finishing a movie once I start it. And so, I completed this flick, even though it was unbearable at times and I regretted it when it ended.The movie is really weird at times. At one point it'll be a family fun type of a movie, and literally the next, it'll be a really dark, brooding and serious. That ""let's go to town"" scene which follows the characters go down the path of drugs and prostitution, only to have it ended as them coming back to camp and return to their normal behavior is a perfect example. It's also an example of this movie being more like a compilation of various SNL skits which are correlated to each other in the fact that they follow a few of the same people at a summer camp.Also, the characters are far too many in number, which leaves no room for character development, AT ALL. We just have these random people ""entertaining"" us by their (mostly) stupid acts with a stupid plot.Maybe it's not that this movie is not funny. Maybe it's just that it got old, and couldn't stand the test of time. But I honestly don't think that that's the case here. The overacting, and the bad acting by some of the characters make me believe that the movie itself is bad.Needless to say, I won't give the mini-series a chance. I mean I can bet it'll be better than this because the actors have really improved by a LOT in all these years and 14-15 years would have meant a huge change in the writing and quality. But I still won't. And that's all because I didn't like the movie.Score: 3/10The 3 points are for actors, and a few jokes that made me smirk once or twice.Definitely won't recommend.If you want still to watch this, just remember, not all cult classics are supposed to be good. Sometimes, they are just not to your taste, while sometimes, they are cult classics for all the wrong reasons. And sometimes, they are purely unworthy to everyone that doesn't belong to the cult. :/That's it. Meet you on my next review. :P",Wet Hot American Summer

In a montage shot, they slowly go from reading books at the library, to smoking cigarettes, to smoking joints, to buying cocaine from a guy on the street, to becoming prostitutes, then becoming strung out heroin-addicts at the local crack house.  This is not your parent's parody movie.From this point on, the film is never the same.  Seemingly normal character development goes out the window, and characters jump from one complete different personality to another within seconds.  We get brilliant lines of dialogue that could only be brought from members of The State, like: ""Hey, there's a problem.  I've got something I need to tell you."" ""Oh no!  You have crabs.""  ""No.  Well, yeah, but that's not the problem.""  ""Oh good.""Pure genius!!!  Why don't more comedies have lines of dialogue like this?Some other great points: ""There is a way we could save everyone's lives. Well, no that couldn't work.  In order for it to work, we would need to have a device that could randomly generate numbers between 1 and 20."" ""That's impossible.  That would take some sort of highly advanced supercomputer to work.""  ""Not necessarily.  No dungeon master goes anywhere without his...20 sided die.""I sort of wish I had known what films were being parodied in this movie.

I finished the movie, because I like to be fair when rating them, but it was difficult. This thing just outright stank. If you're wondering if you might like it, I think the comment by another viewer who talked about the DVD having an optional fart track pretty much sums it up.

'Damn, I better rent me this movie' I thought. I mean, look at the poster for it. It screams National Lampoon yet it stars David Hyde Pierce. I thought it seemed out of place yet he did play Emperor Zombie in the funniest cartoon I've seen in a long time, The Amazing Screw-On Head.So what's it all about? Well, as you can tell from the poster, it's a comedy set in a summer camp. Actors too old to play late teens compete with each other to get laid, barely look after the kids they're responsible for and the camp director tries to hold everything together whilst romantically involving herself with a local astro-physics professor.Thus the stage is set for for an oddball parody comedy that is half styled towards obvious gross-out and half subtly placed laughs. Janeane Garafalo's comic timing is cause for convulsive laughter and there is a hilarious continuous scene in an arts and crafts hall where the children console and build up the character of a crushed divorcée. Everywhere else is chaos with camp leaders having their own dilemma with each other and getting into and out of trouble as the last day of camp forces them into action.I can see why some people wouldn't get this kind of humour which is a shame and while some of the humour is hit-and-miss the laughs have a great batting average and when something is funny it's always gut-busting laughter that is forced out of your lungs.I would certainly recommend this for a group watch with some friends to perk up the evening.",Wet Hot American Summer

Maybe it was actually a good script, but the ham-handed directing ruined it.Only the filmmakers will really know exactly how this film went wrong, the audience just knows where, and that's on screen.I'm a fan of the genre, enjoy good parodies and satires, and felt completely let down by this film.

I love it when things are funny and you're not quite sure why, and this movie fits the bill. It looks thrown together in a good way. I only wish it had made more money, so the same people could have made more films like this. The whole cast is great, but Paul Rudd and especially Christophe Meloni really stand out. Meloni is a genius in this.

97,ZachsMind,It's a rubbernecking train wreck of a movie.,1,10 February 2002,"The film is an obvious attempt to parody the summer camp movie genre which was painfully popular over twenty years ago. It's a bunch of loose-fitting comedic sketches. It probably was really funny on paper, but lost a lot in the production. The pace of the show seems similar to Love American Style, Fantasy Island or Love Boat, and not in a good way (if that's even possible). The film Meatballs did far better satire to this genre back in 1979, and since Meatballs was a screwball comedy satire of summer camps, this movie is a satire of a satire which is a bit over the top. Wet Hot American Summer didn't even need to be written, much less committed to celluloid. Janeane Garofalo is no Ruth Buzzi, but she's not Garofalo at her best here, either. I can't believe a woman of her comedic talent can't get a better script than this. Just once I'd like to see a director who doesn't fear her tattoos. Her agent should keep her away from any script that would require her hair to get moosed; no matter how funny she thinks it's going to be.
The film is supposed to be bad though. It's making fun of trite plot devices, corny coincidences, flat characterization based on stereotypes and a convolution of too many things happening in a film at the same time and nothing ever actually going anywhere but somehow vaguely attempting to make sense at the end. Oh. And late 70s music. So if that's all they were trying to do, they succeeded. However, where I think one was supposed to be laughing, I just found myself wincing at the screen. This film is a bitter disappointment.",Wet Hot American Summer

There's not really a lead actor, but several smaller characters all having to deal with a certain dilemma on the last day of summer camp. The overly exaggerated characters seem to be trying to poke fun at 80's television after school special and exposing the ridiculous mannerisms that we all endure. The only climatic part of the story was towards the end when a threat to the camp is due to the fact that an enormous satellite is aimed for the camp ground and the ""indoor kids"" use their nerdy powers, and the help of Henry (David Hyde Pierce)to prevent in harm to the camp ground.

One of the counselors turns out to be gay, one of the kids has a chance to lose his virginity, the nerd guy likes the hot girl with the jerk boyfriend.Basic movie elements. However, in one trip to town, this entire movie gets turned around. The trip to town is a truly bizarre scene. It starts off kinda normal with the counselors drinking and smoking cigarettes. Then smoking pot. Then all of a sudden they attack an old woman, steal her money, and use it to buy cocaine and heroin. From that point on, the movie makes no sense.

I've personally never been to camp but if it resembles this film in any way, I would be glad to spend my summer there. This is humor at it's finest.

Literally, everything is a joke in this film. From the acting to the script to even little things going on in the foreground.As someone who watches lots of films, it's hard for me to not think of what goes behind the scenes. This is a great film for anyone who shares that mindset. You can tell just by watching it that everyone who was involved had a great time making Wet Hot. 8/10 - I can easily recommend this movie to anyone who likes purposely stupid yet heart felt movies.

109,mattrett,"Hit and Miss, Mostly Miss...",4,12 August 2001,"I was dying to see this once I saw the ridiculous MEATBALLS poster and divined that it had to be the best satire ever. What a brilliant idea for a satire--the genre is rife. Unfortunately, the finished product (as I think all involved probably realize) is a catalogue of missed opportunities, not-quite-there performances and (thankfully!) a few extremely hilarious, inspired bits. Janeane Garafolo, who is very striking, looks really bad here, probably because she is uncomfortably struggling to make her flat role funny. David Hyde Pierce is just sad to watch, trying to hard to be funny and looking like a Castro nerd. Molly Shannon is so funny just SEEING her makes you laugh, but somehow her segment fails to snowball into something hysterical. Paul Rudd had great teen mannerisms and was sexy as hell, the other guys are also really funny (the nerdier ones). I think the problem is the director just doesn't move things along at the right pace. He starts out very deadpan, and that sets the monotone. But when he lets things get really outrageous (the drug sequence is the second funniest moment I've had all year in movies, the first also coming in a lame movie: Andrea Martin in ALL OVER THE GUY complaining about the movie IN & OUT), it's just plain funny. I wanted this movie to work so badly, but it just didn't. The clothes and styling for 1981 are 99.9% PERFECT, and the very few songs used are also perfect.

It's worth owning the DVD for the deleted scenes which are also hysterical or viewing the film with the 'extra fart' track, which I initially thought was too base to be funny, but watching the film with the added sound effects can really push it over the top.

119,longliverock955,"Inconsistent, but down right hilarious!",6,18 January 2002,"I first heard about this movie when Janeane Garofalo went on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote it.  When I heard that it starred her and David Hyde Pierce, I knew this was going to be good!  They said that it opened the next day, and I checked my local paper, only to find that it didn't open in my area.  I guess it must have been only in select cities at the time.  A friend of mine later saw it at a film festival and highly recommended it.Needless to say, when I found it in a video store, I snatched it up as soon as I could.  I didn't know what to expect, other than some stellar performances from Garofalo and Pierce.  What I saw both entertained and disappointed me.The movie starts out as a down to earth comedy.  The story of camp councillors on the last day of summer camp, some looking for love, others simply looking for sex.  There's a very well written scene between my two favorite actors of the movie (if you can't figure out who they are by this point, you haven't been reading closely enough) where they perfectly demonstrate the kind of awkward conversation that occurs between two people who obviously like each other, but are too scared to admit it.The first half of the movie seems to be on the same level:  down to earth and somewhat realistic.  There are many absurd jokes throughout the first half, such as the two boys that drown because one of the councillors is making out with a girl instead of keeping an eye on the water, or the scene in which the camp councilors go into town and end up doing every drug imaginable and then beating up an old lady to steal her purse.  My personal favorite was the parody of movies such as the Mighty Ducks where one councillor gives a big motivational speech about how they're going to come from behind and, with some sort of miracle, win the intercamp softball championships.  The campers point out that this is a rather trite story line, so the councillor cancels the game without much hesitation.  Scenes like these, however, don't seem to dominate the movie.  Serious plot lines of people's romantic interests dominate, leading one to believe that this is a well thought out, romantic comedy.The second half of the film, however, goes in a completely different direction.  In the second half, the film looses all connection to reality, and becomes an all-out spoof of popular movies.  The far-fetched scenes that were sprinkled throughout the first half now become the emphasis of the film, rather than mere comic relief.  There were scenes where I kept expecting somebody to wake up from a dream.  These scenes seem awkward after having seen the first half of the movie, but they are still very well done. It's rare, these days, that a movie will make me actually laugh out loud, but this one sure as hell did.  The second half of the film just became utterly ridiculous, but down right funny.The movie is very muddled.  It seems almost as if the screenwriter decided half way through that he wanted to write a different movie, but then didn't go back to change the first half.  One would think that such big name actors would have objected to such a script, but perhaps they saw, as I did, that the movie is so funny that it's good despite its major shortcomings.  So, basically, if you want to laugh, rent this movie.  If you want a plot that makes sense, this is not for you.",Wet Hot American Summer

I was stuck in small town Alaska, Mtv just came on the air (actually playing music), and this group was having a great Wet Hot American Summer. Sure the movie was actually made 20 years later, but I remember those summers and going to camp every year (after my stint up north), and this movie captured the feel of life back then and the style of the teen sex comedies of the age (only with the off center comedy of The State thrown in the mix).The characters are all genre stereotypes (often exaggerated) but they feel real enough to hold the crisscrossing story lines together, allowing them to all come to actual conclusions without feeling forced or sudden. It's hard to believe that a movie with this much slapstick, potty humor, sight gags, and even some very well thought out jokes actually has this well constructed of a story format. Set aside the continuity issues (mostly caused by the horrible rains they had while trying to film this sunny summer movie) and this low budget comedy actually very well put together. Put all that technical crap side now and just let me talk about how much fun the movie is.I laughed a lot, and not just at the low-brow stuff. They really put a lot of layers into the humor and pulled out all the stops (when most movies would chicken out). It may help that I grew up in the age this was set in and with all the movies it is based around (Meatballs, Breakfast Club, and the rest), but I still think it works for anyone who likes the style of humor found in groups like ""The State"" (who were heavily involved in this) and the ""Upright Citizens Brigade"". Not a perfect movie, but more than enough fun to make up for the low budget and technical flaws found in it.Plus, the DVD includes lot of great extras that are often more amusing than the movie itself. These include interviews, deleted scenes (with commentary), music montages, full Commentary Track, and even a low-brow track that adds extra fart noises for fun.",Wet Hot American Summer

It is deadly dry as a British made martini - stirred, and shaked slowly - and in the next moment it is over-self-explatory gems. It is as absurd as it is straight forward and honest.One of the greatest features of the film, is how every character has a story, a function.

I loved all the random story lines, and the quirkyness of this movie. The ensemble cast is amazing. Every character is funny. I have always thought summer camp is a great premise for movies, and this one really hit the nail on the head. It reminded me of my own experience at camp. It really captured the feeling you get during camp, which is that everything is a very big deal! I was happy that they had the gay scene because it was a bit shocking, but the best was the friends positive reaction. I think the chase seen in the beginning and the town scene are two of the funniest scenes in the movie. Overall this movie was great!!!

136,soundfreq,Camp... What more does anyone want?,10,7 January 2002,"I saw this movie a few months ago during its limited release in the only theater playing it in the entire Washington DC area.  I can't wait to own it.This movie was absolutely hilarious.  If you enjoyed the comedy stylings of the State, then you will <<repeat>> you will find this funny. However, there are other reasons to see this movie.  Garofalo, Shannon, and Hyde Pierce are professional comic actors who help to anchor the unbridled sketch and improv based humor of former State members and Amy Poehler (who is from UCB - my only friend is Chaos, as well), and they all form it into one cohesive, exremely funny, 90 minute movie.But this is the part that I like:  Yes, as many other of the ""astute"" observers who have posted comments here have noted - There's a lot of Meatballs (and various other less popular 80's era camp movies) in this movie.  But Meatballs was a little bit more optimistic about the eternal adolescent quest for nookie.  American Summer kind of showed the awkward lack of self confidence involved with the different types of Characters (marino, showalter, garofalo, etc).But If you are going make a film and your goal is to parody or (and I quote) to ""deliberately exaggerate [clichéd conventions of a dramatic form like comedy] to the point of ridiculousness"" why not make it about summer CAMP.",Wet Hot American Summer

Usually this totally dooms its chances of apealing to my pretentious, monty python loving side, but this movie ran the perfect fine line between irreverence and stupidity.  It ran the tight rope all the way across to the finish and i was laughing almost entirely throughout.  The absurdity of its gags was presented in such a way that it just breeds laughter like rabbits.  Maybe it's just me, but when a can encourages a man to be unashamed of his sexuality by admitting that it can suck its own dick and likes to do it... a lot... I cannot contain my laughter in the least.  I encourage anyone to see this movie.

The plot was promising at first, but it quickly turned really dull. The characters were shallow and the acting was mostly sub-par. And the jokes... There were a lot of jokes. Unfortunately none of them were to my liking. There were a few jokes that had the potential to be really funny, but they weren't played out well in my opinion.If you enjoyed the jokes from the trailer, you're probably going to think this is a great movie.

I saw this blind without any info on it and peed my pants laughing. This is amazing dry humor and I was not at all expecting to be hysterical as many times as I did. My sister and I watched it and felt like we were kids again watching Airplane for the first time. We are counting the hours until the Netflix series tomorrow night! We kept asking ourselves why we hadn't heard of it? We are in our early 40s and grew up going to these kinds of camps, so we both agreed you have to let this over the top genius of a spoof take you back to a crazy and happy time.

I was completely set to see a movie about camping in the early 80s and when I saw it on Netflix I knew it was time. Then splat, I couldn't believe the garbage I was seeing. Yeah it was cool to see some of my favorite comedians and actors in one of their earlier films, like Paul Rudd, but I didn't laugh once. I saw it as a dramedy trying too hard to have some comedic value but failed miserably. Maybe it was my expectations or maybe you had to have experienced camps similar to this to understand it. Whatever the reason I can safely say that I am glad I never watched this film when it came out or I might not have risked seeing some of the actors' later films.A lot of people seemed to like it though so despite the fact that I didn't I wouldn't say don't waste your time.

This movie is pretty stupid. But in the good way. The humor is raunchy, crude, and over the top. I think people misinterpret it before they go into it but just expect stupidity on all levels. The cast is on point and it was funny to see all the big stars today (For example Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd) super young. But this movie isn't totally perfect. It grew kind of droll at times, and it was like the writers hit us with a hilarious scene or line and then it was kind of boring for the next fifteen minutes. The funny scenes are definitely worth it however, I don't know if it's because I'm young and amused by the stupid but this is one comedy you shouldn't miss.",Wet Hot American Summer

This movie was great, don't listen to the other reviews.  It was a great mix of sketch comedy, movie comedy and serious acting to make a winning film.  I saw it as less of a parody and more of a homage towards those classic summer camp movies.  It was a perfect vehicle for Showalter and Wain's brand of comedy.  Best of all they stayed away from making tired out time period jokes which ruin anything (anyone ever see that 80's Show?).I was a little worried when I saw Shannon's and Garofolo's name in the credits.  Usually they can kill anything.  Especially Shannon.  Garofolo was amazingly good for having to do so many different kinds of comedy. Shannon of course was playing the same tired out character that she always does on anything she is in, but was saved by the young Gideon Jacobs.  That kid was great.Everyone else was of course great.  It's great to see the State guys back together.  Amy Poehler is hillarious and one of the few truly funny women out there today.The fact that this movie was never a huge hit just affirms my suspicion that Americans today are retarded.  We will continue to see stupid movies like 40 days and 40 nights and the American Pies while good writers, actors and movies get ignored.",Wet Hot American Summer
146,Darth Maligna,One of the funniest films ever made.,10,2 May 2006,"This movie is in my personal list of the most hilarious films of all time, along with movies like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" and ""The Jerk."" It is an absolute breath of fresh air the first time through, and every subsequent viewing is just as good as the last; many jokes get funnier, and there are side-splitting subtleties that only become apparent with time. The type of humour is varied but uniformly brilliant, from the camp counselors' hour-long descent into and return from a hellish nightmare of addiction and misery, to a character who is no longer necessary to the scene getting up and walking straight off the end of a pier, to a steamy love scene between two men being superimposed on the conversation two other characters are simultaneously having about setting one of the participants up with various girls named Debbie.Performances in the film are uniformly brilliant. Janeane Garafalo particularly stands out with a performance that is oftentimes so perfectly and purposefully bad that it's incredibly good. Her stilted delivery of old romantic clichés, her occasional hilariously mistimed line of dialogue, and her obvious ad-libbing of a list of ridiculously Jewish-sounding campers are all brilliantly played. David Hyde Pierce is wonderful as a mild-mannered, somewhat high-strung astrophysicist whose occasional unexpected single-line outbursts (""I said NO!"" ""F*ck my c*ck!"") are some of the funniest moments of the movie. Paul Rudd is utterly hilarious in the role of Andy, a shallow, studly sociopath who allows multiple campers to drown while busy cheating on his girlfriend. He nails every scene he is in in any capacity. His dialogue while disposing of the drowning witnesses is both shocking and hysterical, his tantrum scene in the mess hall is cramp-inducingly funny, and he consistently delivers on his more subtle moments, such as playing the air guitar during the climactic talent show scene. Michael Showalter is another standout, both for his writing and his hilarious dual portrayal of both Coop and Alan Shemper, and Chris Meloni is both unbelievably and unexpectedly funny; he'll certainly surprise people who know him from his work on shows like Law & Order: SVU. But really, there is not a bad performance in this film.Certainly this film is not for everyone. The closest comedic comparisons I can draw would be to the films ""Pee Wee's Big Adventure"" and ""Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter,"" but really all three movies are in classes by themselves. If you don't understand the humour of classic Python, especially Flying Circus, don't even bother. In any case, I can't guarantee that you'll enjoy this film, but the good news is that if you get it, you REALLY get it, and you'll be able to enjoy it for a very long time.",Wet Hot American Summer

I would rather watch Weekend at Bernie's 2 three times in a row than see this again. This movie was flat, unfunny, and just a complete waste of time. I am sorry, I really wanted it to be good, but I think I laughed once the entire time. Molly Shannon was good, but still not that funny.

Even the random humor is hilarious if you can appreciate it. While it is beneficial to be a fan of The State, it certainly is not necessary and there's plenty of humor for everyone.

The best part that comes to mind is the ""secret handshake"" scene. Watch how secretive and original their handshake is. And then there are the great moments by Joe Lo Truglio, Ken Marino, and Chris Merloni. This movie is just ridiculously hilarious. The amount of absurd humor in this movie should make any interesting, smart, humorous person revel in glee. I could go on and on about this movie, and really what I should be talking about is, how does one NOT like the movie, think it is stupid, and not ""get it""? I've seen a lot of bad comments about this movie, and granted, Showalter and Wain are a few steps above the normal mainstream type of humor seen nowadays. They take it to that level of redundancy and absurdity that most cannot do. The typical gay joke gag in a movie like American Pie 2 is taken that much further to an explicit themed gay sex scene in ""Wet Hot"".

I have always been a big fan of Janeane Garofalo (hope I spelled that right) and she is really funny in this, I think everything she says is funny-- it's just the way that she says things!

195,sportsfan_ian,Disappointed by this movie,2,19 July 2017,"User reviews on IMDb said this movie is a classic send up of many popular teen movies. I was wondering what I had missed. Why was this movie revered by some yet I had never once seen it by chance on cable? Surely it must be good when it has an impressive cast that includes: David Hyde Pierce, Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Joe Lo Truglio, Janeane Garofalo, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd, Molly Shannon and Christopher Meloni. It's praised as a comedy classic from David Wain and Michael Schowalter so I got a copy of it and viewed it. It was made for $5 million and I forgave the low production quality is forgivable. There are plenty of movies made for cheap that I have liked. But just a few minutes into ""Wet Hot American Summer"" it was clear that the script, directing and editing were all terrible. So, while the run time is officially 97 minutes it felt more like 180 minutes. It spends most of its time setting up jokes that fail to deliver a good punchline. At the heart of this movie there is a message that it is OK to be yourself. Celebrate who you are whether you're a nerd or jock or whatever. An awkward budding romance develops between geeky camp director Janeane Garofalo and nerdy astrophysics associate professor David Hyde Pierce. This message is underlined and in bold italics with the coupling and exchange of vows between Bradley Cooper with Michael Ian Black. As well, by Christopher Meloni, who has by far the most interesting character to play: a shell shocked Vietnam vet who's best friend is a talking tin can. He gives a fine soliloquy where he admits his own foibles and publicly accepts himself as he is (a guy who humps fridges and has dick cream). And most disturbingly: by Molly Shannon leaving her husband for a 12 year old boy. WTF. But the talented cast is wasted by the story and lines they are fed. Christopher Meloni's talking can has a joke that's something to do about having a dick that's long enough to suck yourself which is awful. Letting the actors act instead of talk is the only parts of the movie that generated actual laughs for me. For example, when Paul Rudd is making out with Elizabeth Banks and unconcerned that a kid is driving around in a speedboat is genuinely funny. And also when he throws food on the floor and acts like a toddler while Janeane Garofalo picks it up.The talent show serves as the climax of the movie and you would think that is where the production team would have made sure their cast hit comedic home runs. Instead we get a brief confrontation between Molly Shannon and Judah Friedlander, who plays her husband and should have been given way more screen time. And we find out that wind generated magically by the geekiest of all campers saved them because it steered a piece of Skylab that fell to earth away from the talent show. Groan. Amy Poehler throws herself into her role and her performance is my favourite. She comes through this mess of a movie to the end relatively unscathed. But otherwise I just feel badly for all who were involved and will avoid wasting time watching any Michael Wain or David Showalter projects in the future.",Wet Hot American Summer

The whole movie is very stupid (in a good way; stupid as in funny), so if you're looking for a deep and moving experience that actually makes sense, look elsewhere. It's about the last day of summer camp in August 1981 and the events that occur between various campers and counselors. From saving the camp from a piece of Skylab, putting together a crazy talent show, and a cook and counselor learning how to show their true colors, it's a wacky film you won't soon forget.If you're not a fan of Jack Handy or the show ""Family Guy"", then you probably won't find this very entertaining. It's very random and idiotic, but that's what makes it so hilarious IMO. It's somewhat like Napoleon Dynamite, only...funnier.My cousin introduced the film to my sister and I, saying it was her favorite. My cousin is very funny, so I figured the film would be. She told us it gets funnier every time you see it and I just thought, ""Okay..."" As I watched it, I was sitting on the couch the whole time thinking, ""What the ****?"", because I didn't understand it AT ALL. There was no plot to the movie, and I was so confused. It was then that I realized the point of the film was that there was no point. I don't know how I saw it again (because I really didn't like it that much) but I was watching it and thought ""This is actually kind of funny."" I ended up laughing my @$$ off, unlike I had during my previous experience.

Want some proof?Here's what one guy said: ""All the actors who participated in this farce of a film should be but on acting suspension for stooping so low. The story was rubbish, the acting was terrible, and the sensationalization of homosexually was downright immoral.""Wow, farce of a movie?  That's kind of what it was, Einstein.  Nice use of the word ""but"", you tasteless homophobe; it's not like the ""b"" is particularly close to the ""p"" on the keyboard.  I find your intolerance and your ability to invent new words sensationalizationingly immoral.And then there's this genius: ""I don't know where to start.

Nice job noticing how the director cast 30 year olds as 16 year olds.  The 80s summer camp movies WHAS parodied didn't resort to anything like that.  I just want to know why you're wasting your time writing IMDB reviews when you could be saving the world with your brilliant insight.But this one's my favorite: ""David Hyde Pierce has sunk so low. Niles Crane would have had a heyday with this movie. I did not laugh once.""Is that funny enough, or do I have to tack anything on to that?

203,mattcho,One of the best genre spoofs ever!,10,16 September 2001,"I just came back from seeing ""Wet Hot American Summer"" in David Wain and Molly Shannon's hometown of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and here is my story.For the first time in many years, I was initially drawn to this film based on the movie poster alone. Easily the best film poster of the new millenium, it recaptures the zany cartoon-style montage virtually unused since the 70's and 80's.This is one of the best genre spoofs ever. It looks AND (more importantly) feels like a late 70's/early 80's picture. This is a rare achievement, as most genre comedies (e.g., ""The Wedding Singer""), are much too glossy and forced to create this effect. The only films in recent years that have come close are ""Dazed and Confused"" and ""Jackie Brown."" From the hair styles (e.g., white male afro, middle parts, feathered hair), to the clothes (e.g., ragged jeans shorts with white pocket liners hanging out), to even the calculators (those that made that annoying clicking noise each time a button was pushed), every detail was impressively accurate. In addition, perhaps due to its low budget (an estimated $1 million) or perhaps the result of the director's sharp attention to detail, the soundtrack contains rarely heard 80's gems (and newly recorded music that sound straight out of the 80's) and is filmed in a way that creates an aged, authentic look. To further generate the spirit of the camp comedy genre (or again the result of a low budget), the stars were even asked to sleep in cabins during the shoot.The film's gags are rapid-fire. The biggest laughs (spoiler alert) were drawn from the ""office rampage"" and the ""wedding gift."" ""Wet Hot.."" also contains the best use of hair gel since ""There's Something About Mary"" and has the most canned laughter since ""Three's Company."" For those who have seen the picture, you know precisely what I'm referring to. For the head-scratching majority, I compel you to find out.However, what makes this film even more authentically funny is its subtle 80's humor. True to form with many of the comedies it parodies, some jokes fall completely flat and various plot lines seem out of place and disjointed. Too bad most critics are not able to dig beyond the obvious, in your face jokes to realize that the ""unfunny"" and ""confusing"" moments were planted as a throwback to the 70's/80's comedy style.Well done, David Wain!

This movie is just about one of the funniest damn things that I've ever seen. Not for the meek, this film takes Summer Camp on all fronts, and will leave you wishing it hadn't ended. The only reason I was grateful to see the credits rolling was to catch my breath and make sure I hadn't pee'd myself. These guys are the real deal and are destined for success. The cast is incredible, the music is perfect(way to go Craig!), and the film makes you long for the days when all comedies left you with the feeling that you've gotten your money's worth. Bottom line, pray for wide distribution so you can see this film.",Wet Hot American Summer
207,bicyclebob99,An underrated classic,10,9 March 2004,"For any fan of the short lived television show ""The State"" or off beat comedies than this movie is for you.  Set on the final day of a summer camp, the ""Wet hot"" takes a look at the doings of the camp counselors (all in their 20's and 30's and playing 17) and puts them into crazy scenes. Featuring some outrageous scenes and an off kilter, sly sense of humor the cast really comes through here.  This is not a standard by the book comedy. If you're not a fan of sketch comedy and sly sense of humor than you are not going to be a huge fan of this classic.  But if you grew up on movies like ""meatballs"" and you find the ""The State"" even semi funny than this is right up your alley. The cast is quite good.  Paul Rudd as dim, stud is a revelation in this comedic role. Even Janeane Garofalo is funny in this in the lead role as the love sick and uncool camp director who falls in love with geeky, nerdy David Hyde Pierce.",Wet Hot American Summer

Nobody in this movie wants anything but a cute guy or gal to kiss when they want. There's no real point to this movie, no meaningful conversations between others, no laugh-out-loud funny jokes.

My criteria for a good comedy is simple: make me genuinely laugh and don't insult my intelligence. It's also crucial to understand in what manner the film makers are intending to tickle the proverbial funny bone; is the humor sly, irreverent, cynical, slapstick, absurd, satiric, quirky, silly, observational, dark, sassy, etc.?It's very difficult to classify ""Wet Hot American Summer.""  It took the film about 20 minutes to start hitting an unbelievable level of joke execution. I wont give away any details, but there are some tear-inducing, laugh riot moments in this picture.  It's densely packed with comedy of every variety - scenes that take a joke farther than you would imagine.  ""Wet Hot American Summer"" has humor that ranges literally from subtle, hinting jokes to broad slapstick, subversive humor, perverse and shocking moments, and mocking sarcasm (even at its own expense).I could say so much more, how I laughed myself to tears watching this picture, but I will keep it short.

Wain and Showalter's perfect blend of the absurd with keenly satiric mark this films as one of the great film comedies of all times, equal to any of the Monty Python boys' ventures into film. Dealing with all of the classic camp situations from counselor relationships, the big talent show, the outcasts, the big game, capture the flag, overnight trips, redemption, reality and a talking can of vegetables, ""Wet Hot American Summer"" takes it all to a new, better level of comedy that will not soon be forgotten.

The reason you might not have heard of it is because it isn't as advertised as other movies, because it doesn't have the type of budget to advertise itself. It breaks my heart that horribly made, unfunny, unoriginal movies, such as American Pie 2, were in more theaters and are more available to rent or buy.
The humor in WHAS is not comparable to humor in any other movie that comes to mind. The humor is a lot like the what you would see on The State (because it was written/directed by State cast members). Many scenes are just so ridiculous that you have to laugh, and if you don't, its because you are taking the movie too seriously.The day this movie came out on video, my friends and I watched it as many times as we could manage to, in one day. Every time we watched, we noticed something new, and still laughed hysterically at the stuff we noticed the first time.

222,Q-bist,An eye-opener...,10,27 May 2002,"...that shows me that most comedies really don't ""get it.""If there's anything wrong with WHAS, it's that it doesn't pander, which is why it can never achieve mainstream success.  Comedy of this quality is rare, and thanks to the dimness of the masses, it will likely remain that way.The humor and fun of this movie is almost entirely implicit because it spends time in the beginning to give the characters ground.  They become believable and realistic characters, and that's not what people expect from a spoof.  Then it plays with the characters in parodic sketches.  The writing is absolutely brilliant to be able to make you laugh without any harm to the integrity of the characters, and it works even under the most extreme situations.  The characters also become real with excellent, believable comedic acting and an impeccable cast.Too many people are going to take it seriously, and they won't even know it's a joke.  It might actually require unlearning what other comedies have taught you to really ""get"" this one.  Even I was confused at the beginning of my first viewing.  It just isn't what one expects from this industry. Even The State's comedy was less latent when they were on MTV (while still far from the extent of pandering).This movie has heart.  The creators are giving us material they can actually care for instead of the lame drivel that would drive box office sales.  In refusing to spoon-feed its audience, it alienates the unweaned masses.  If you can accept a different approach, I urge you to give this movie a try.",Wet Hot American Summer

I have met MANY very nice Christian people and they do not judge me by my beliefs. This film has many funny parts but the parts that were highly immoral were very disturbing.

The twisted sense of humor that Michael Showalter and David Wain both possess help create a unique and hilarious movie. The funny thing about this movie that I think many people don't realize is that this movie is making fun of itself, Wain and Showalter were simply trying to make a movie that makes us laugh and they accomplished that.  Be warned though, if you don't enjoy laughing or find that you yourself don't own a sense of humor then do not watch this movie. WHAS is a parody of movies such as ""Meatballs"" and gives the viewer a new kind of comedy that is most likely not suitable for the mainstream comedy fans who simply ""don't get it.""  For those of you who do not like this movie then all I can say is, sorry and hopefully you'll stop taking life so seriously someday.

This spoof of summer camp movies from the 70's and 80's does a great job of recreating the implausible and predictable plots of the movies of the ear while still staying incredibly funny and fresh. WHAS touches on all the old themes, such as the nice guy trying to get the hot girl, the director awkwardly trying to find love, and the outcast who saves the day. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are the ones that are so random and unexpected-Andy and the kids in the van, the trip into town, etc.-that you just have to laugh.

I think the reason that people dont like this movie is because they really dont get it. Some people think this is a spoof on 80's summer camp movies. Really its almost a spoof of a spoof. The main cast is from Mtv's groundbreaking ""The State"" and its not your basic garbage comedy with cliche jokes or gags that anyone with a brain could see coming from a mile away. Thats what i think most people wanted or thought this movie was going to have, like some episode of a mindless sitcom. Heres an example of the genius of this film, and a scene a lot of posters complain about: When McKinley  and the other guy (sorry) go into a shed and have sweaty bare back sex. This is funny because its so unexpected and so graphic that its just absurd. Thats what other posters dont get, this isnt your typical cookie cutter comedy. Or when Andy lets a kid drown in the lake on his watch because he was making out with a girl, and the kids swimming buddy tells him hes going to be in trouble, it cuts to a scene with Andy and the kid in a van driving fast down a winding road, and Andy tells the kid ""they are going to a super secret pizza party"", he then pushes the kid out of the van while its moving.

Crass, goofy, slapstick, you name it, this flick has it. I need to keep typing to meet the crappy minimum review length. Have you ever seen the Blair Witch Project? I saw it when I was like 12, and I loved it. I'm afraid to watch it again in case it actually sucks as bad as everyone says it does.",Wet Hot American Summer
247,ergadeos,Not about summer camp. Better than you think. You may be lost.,10,21 March 2004,"This is one of my favorite movies. The comedy is very specific and if you don't get it, then you will think it is the most inane movie ever.  It is NOT about summer camp, it is set at a summer camp.  It might help to know that there is a fervent fan base for the movie.  They hold midnight screenings in New York.  I went to one as Associate Professor Newman.  My roomates won second place as McKinley and Ben.The other comedy of the cast is also fantastic.  This comes from a strong history starting with The State (MTV, mid 90's), and a bunch of shows in between.  You have to check out Michael Showalter, David Wain, and Michael Ian Black's comedy group Stella.  If you knew how huge they were in New York you might understand.",Wet Hot American Summer
248,theatrefreak8,Absolutely Hilarious,8,13 January 2005,"This movie is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, although slightly disturbing at times. It is rather weird, but that's what makes it so funny. The first time I saw it, I laughed, but I has gotten a little stuck on how completely random everything was. The second time I saw it though, I (and the the people I was watching with) all were laughing nonstop through the whole movie. This stuff is great, really. My favorite scenes are the ones with all the science geeks. I love them. :) I also really like the plot with Molly Shannon. It's great. So, if you do happen to watch this movie in the future, don't let yourself get stuck on the weirdness of the plot. Just be ready to laugh your head off. So, I would highly recommend this movie, especially if you happen to find really random stuff to be funny.",Wet Hot American Summer
249,kraada,this movie rocks,10,20 July 2004,"Wet Hot American Summer is a hilarious parody of all camp movies everywhere.If you've seen such movies, or just been to a bunch of different camps (as a child or as a counselor) you should find this movie extraordinarily amusing. I highly recommend it. The movie takes place during the last day of camp, on which everything important happens (of course). There's the Geek Crowd, the Dork Who Wants The Girl, and so many other stereotypes, all done in very funny fashions. Also, if you get the DVD you can listen to the Extra Farts soundtrack. It's only really funny for about 10 minutes, but the movie WITH EXTRA FARTS. Come on, that's hilarious!",Wet Hot American Summer
250,TheRoom101,You either get it or you don't.,10,25 November 2004,"This movie IS an 80's Summer Camp Movie... that was made in 2001. The point of this film hits a smaller demographic than some parodies do, but if you loved Summer Camp movies then this will be great for you. The humor is really subtle and the dialogue is unbelievable. The cast alone makes this movie gold. Characters from memorable sketch comedy troupes - Michael Ian Black (The State), Molly Shannon (SNL) - and more mainstream comedians - David Hyde Pierce (Fraiser), Janeane Garofalo (Truth About Cats & Dogs) - are just the beginning of a great list.I could try to analyze exactly why this movie is funny so the rest of the population has some insight... but really, you either get it or you don't.",Wet Hot American Summer
251,eo27,Honestly The Best Movie Ever,10,1 January 2005,"I have seen this movie about 50 times, and i never get sick of it. If you have remotely any good sense of humor, you will love this movie. It's an example and a movie that the more you watch it, the better it gets. And whoever claims that this movie is bad and compares it to Adam scandal movies has no sense of humor!! Honestly, if that's what you find funny, you are boring and stereotypical. So Unorginial. This movie is hilarious!! It's absolutely ridiculous and Genius. I like a lot of movies and this is my all time favorite...I don't think I will ever see a movie that will top this one. Watch it again and again, it continues to get better! Enjoy!",Wet Hot American Summer
252,ahamade,"an ingenious parody of cheesy 1980's summer camp movies in the spirit of ""Porky's""",8,8 January 2005,"This is the feel-good hit of the summer of 1981. Members of the incredibly funny comedy troupe, ""The State"", do a parody film of hits like ""Porky's"" and ""Meatballs"" by over-cliché-ifying (yes, I made up that word) situations such as the nerdy-guy-gets-the-girl (sort of), and a-camp-counselor-saves-the day. Anyone who watches this movie, hopefully, will understand that it's entirely tongue-in-cheek, but perhaps, some other people's senses of humor are not that well refined. The gags in this movie are taken to the utmost extreme of corniness for the sake of, somehow, coming out that much smarter. The dry wit and morbidity of Michael Showalter and Michael Ian Black shines stunningly. SO GET OVER YOURSELF and watch this movie with an open mind (BECAUSE PORKY'S REALLY SUCKED!!!)",Wet Hot American Summer
253,punkmeabs,"Wet Hot American Summer, is what every counselor in a summer camp wants their camp to be like. It's the fun and excitement in two days.",10,2 February 2005,"I myself am a summer camp counselor, and when i saw this movie it reminds me of all the awesome stuff you get to do as a counselor. Despite of out of whack it seems, it's a little close in some actuality. It's an hour and half of fun! It just gives you a chance to laugh, and have a good time. Great movie if you want to laugh, and be reminded of every great summer you've had! Despite the sick humor, and the swears, it's pretty much just a good time. There's one ""gay"" love scene but it's 20 seconds long and nothing graphic, and it just adds more to the story. then there are so many jokes taken from old school 80's summer camp movies. There are drug references, and sexual references but all of those can be over looked. The cast is superb some of the best names in comedy coming together to create something hysterical! Highly Recommended!",Wet Hot American Summer
254,londonisdead85,Unsure what it wants to be,4,24 February 2020,"The first half of the film feels like its struggling to decide what type of film it wants to be. Sometimes it feels like a grounded coming-of-age comedy like Dazed and Confused, others times like a mesh of many different comedy-styles and tones like Caddyshack, but also mixed in is some parody like Not another Teen Movie.The second half of the film abandons that and becomes a full-on spoof film, but poorly done with a lot of over-acting.This is one for people wanting to see early-roles of many famous names, or people who like 'LOL random' type comedy.",Wet Hot American Summer
255,toddrajek,Fake Reviews?,1,25 April 2015,"I can only assume the high ratings and stellar reviews for this film were bought and paid for. I registered for an account for the sole purpose to warn others what a complete waste of time this movie was. I tuned in because the cast contained so many actors and actresses I have enjoyed in other roles and expected at least a modicum humor.Ugh... no. I'm sure someone wrote a script for this film. I think it was flushed out on piece of bathroom tissue that was then heavily used. Some of the performances seemed strained in a how-did-I-get-myself-into-this manner. The multiple sub-plots were weak and the idea that this movie was a spoof of past camp films, like ""Meatballs"" et. al. is laughable. About the only laugh I got out of the film.I tried to like it, but it as the credits started rolling I realized no amount of replay was going to uncover a missed gem of hilarity. Please stay away.",Wet Hot American Summer
256,jimavary,Good soundtrack..,1,23 April 2021,They picked some good music.. other than that?? Waste of time. Unfunny.,Wet Hot American Summer
257,missile_jockey24,Don't waste your time.,1,26 February 2007,"I was drawn in by the opening credits, which had a great song. That was the highlight of this movie. The entire flick was so disjointed, the slapstick was far from funny, and the humor on the whole was severely lacking. It would be one thing if they tried to parody a few of the old summer camp movies, but this one tries to do every single one at the expense of the plot. Simultaneously.The more serious sub-plots suffer from being placed in-between slap-stick sequences so horrible that they're nearly forgotten. When you're trying to follow eight story lines at once, you're not going to have an easy time. Save yourself the trouble and just change the channel if this comes on. It's not funny, and you won't even find yourself chuckling under your breath.",Wet Hot American Summer
258,andrewjedgcumbe,Best Comedy,10,10 March 2019,I loved it. From the star studded cast to the ridiculous story line... the goofs and comedic timing. The low budget makes it very authentic. (I watched both series based on the film and they come nowhere near this),Wet Hot American Summer
259,gabrielfballard,Cult Classic! One of my Favorite Comedies of all time!,10,7 August 2015,"I've watched this movie a couple of times already, and it never grows old. The continuous stream of jokes, with the subtle insert of wackiness and just the right amount of randomness, this movie is great for people who have fallen in love with the Monty Pythonesque style of comedy. One of my favorite parts is seeing all these A-List actors and actresses in this movie over 15 years ago! If you are wondering whether to watch this and the TV show that recently came out, you should watch this first. It will give you a treat once you watch Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, due to the subtle references to the movie. If you are into a unique comedy style, this movie is for you!",Wet Hot American Summer
260,loickguerel,Cult but not so great,7,3 August 2018,"Very fun comedy, not so silly, great sense of fun, with some good moments, with actors really great. The rythm isn't perfect, it's too long in the final act, but, that's the rule when you have only little pieces of a story. And it's really fun to watching some of the biggest stars of the genre in their beginnings !!",Wet Hot American Summer
261,Lee_Bailey,A brilliant film with one VERY serious problem,10,23 May 2007,"This is one of the most hilarious movies I've seen in my life. It also has an edited-for-TV version that literally *destroys* the film.I thought I'd point this out because I've noticed a few of the reviewers who gave this movie a low score mentioned catching it on TV. That's rather heartbreaking, considering how smart, subversive, original, and wildly funny 'Wet Hot' is in its intended form.Granted, a certain amount of editing would have been necessary in any case -- the film is definitely on the profane side. Still, it's never lazy; offensive content is not used as a stand in for funny material, but rather to intensify some really brilliantly surprising, devastatingly hilarious moments.What's tragic is that the television version apparently cannot even tell where the jokes are in the original version. The original film's greatest strength, perhaps, is lulling you into a false sense of security with intentional cheesiness and 'soft' jokes before throwing its hardball material at you. Alas, the television version seems to feel it's necessary to keep the all setup material while editing out all the actual punchlines.That aside, if we're talking about the proper version which is available on DVD, this film is recommend for anyone who enjoys intelligent, subversive, absurd, and aggressively funny comedy in the vein of Stella, The State, Strangers with Candy and Adult Swim on a good day.",Wet Hot American Summer
262,JosephMallo,My kind of film,10,24 January 2014,"""Wet Hot American Summer"" is one of those rare films in a person's life that is exactly the kind of film you would make if you had the opportunity to create one. Every silly gag to it's one of a kind brand of random irrelevant comedy. The film features the ""Stella"" comedy group: Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, and director David Wain. The rest of the cast is peppered by actors and actresses that would go on to become A list Hollywood actors. People like Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper, and Amy Poehler.This movie still makes me laugh after years of routine viewings with friends. From ""listen to me Mr. Kickass"" to a van brutally hitting a tree while being serenaded to the tune of ""Danny's song"". This is absolutely the kind of film that you and your friends will insist on new friends to see, in order to ""get"" your kind of humor. I can't recommend this movie enough. Hopefully we will someday get the long rumored prequel from director David Wain.",Wet Hot American Summer

That montage alone is worth the watching the whole movie through, which actually works great as a twisted kind of parody of the whole ""summer camp"" movie genre. This movie really is at a couple of different levels and I just thought it was very funny. Jeanine Garofalo was very good in this and she and David Hyde Pierce had a good comic energy. I suspect the mediocre ratings for this in IMDb is because of the ridiculously low ratings given by people who don't recognize parody. Maybe it helps if you went to summer camp. I just found it to be very funny with some real quirkiness and some twisted humor that might not be for everyone. But if you like that sort of stuff, it was great.",Wet Hot American Summer

After watching this movie, it has prompted me to try and live like Andy, the hard ass. Katie, my new celebrity crush, is awesome. I didn't think it got much better after watching her in D3, but after seeing this, well hot damn. The casting for this movie was perfect, every actor portrayed their role like nobody's business. Plus the music is pretty good too. Some Loverboy, Foreigner, and a couple of original scores that hit the spot. Don't waste your money renting this movie, buy it.
