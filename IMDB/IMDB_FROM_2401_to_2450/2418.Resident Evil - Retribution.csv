0,Leofwine_draca,More junk from a talentless director,2,30 July 2015,"It's pretty amazing that Hollywood keeps throwing money at Paul W. S. Anderson to make films with his wooden wife, Milla Jovovich. RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION is yet another instalment in the endless franchise, and there are so many of these cookie cutter movies that by now I've lost count of where we are in the series. This follows straight on with the last one and tries for freshness with a few 'virtual reality' scenes of zombie attacks, but for the most part it's just incessant CGI action.Jovovich has always been poor in these movies; a supposed kick-ass heroine, she continually fails to have any screen presence whatsoever. As she gets older so her body becomes unable to do some of the tougher stunts, so the films get more reliant on CGI as they go on. This one sees Jovovich fighting villains ripped off from SILENT HILL, teaming up and fighting some old faces, and going up against various unstoppable bad guys. It's completely yawn worthy, with nothing we haven't seen before, and I frequently checked my watch, hoping it would all be over soon. Anderson's direction is awful, obsessed with flashy slow motion which looks like a teenage boy was directing.Realising just how poor and plot less these films have become, Anderson tries desperately to draw in old and new fans alike. So we get a Chinese character (Li Bingbing) for Asian audiences, plus the return of Michelle Rodriguez and Colin Salmon after they died in the first film. Sadly, Salmon only makes a brief cameo, although Rodriguez has more to work with and seems to be the toughest out of all of them. Jovovich is a bore, but her acting is sublime in comparison to the excruciating Sienna Guillory, who gives the most wooden line readings I've ever heard. This is a dud all round.",Resident Evil - Retribution
1,SnoopyStyle,"Lots a shooting, Lots a shooting, Lots a shooting",5,19 September 2013,"Following the last movie, Alice is captured and imprisoned by The Red Queen in an Umbrella Corporation's underground facility in Kamchatka. Now Wesker wants Alice to put on a last stand for humanity alongside him. With Ada Wong on the inside and a team from the outside, they try to escape from The Red Queen.There isn't much going on storywise. They put in virtual environments in the facility so that they could play out some of the action in NY and Moscow. There are also clones in this facility so that Sienna Guillory, Michelle Rodriguez, and Oded Fehr can return to the franchise. At its core, it's all about the action. The story isn't that important. It's not really a movie. It's more a video game. Enjoy!",Resident Evil - Retribution
2,claudio_carvalho,A Video-Game with Explosions and Shootings,6,1 January 2013,"Alice (Milla Jovovich) awakes at home with her daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer) and her husband. But soon she realizes that she is actually in an Umbrella Corporation's underground facility. Out of the blue, the computer security system shuts-down and Alice flees to the central control room of the facility. She meets Ada Wong (Bingbing Li), who works with Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), and she learns that a five-man team has been sent by Wesker to rescue them. However, the Red Queen sends Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) to hunt them down. ""Resident Evil 5 – Retribution"" is so far the weakest movie of this franchise. Actually it is a video-game with a short story and lots of explosions and shootings. ""Resident Evil 5 – Retribution"" works better on Blu-Ray or DVD, since it might be unbearable for those who have gone to the movie theater to see this flick. The writer needs new ideas and not reboot the story. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Resident Evil – Retribuição"" (""Resident Evil – Retribution"")Note: On 02 February 2017, I saw this film again.",Resident Evil - Retribution
3,nogodnomasters,MADE FOR A VIDEO GAME,7,22 August 2018,"This film was clearly designed with a video game in mind. The first two minutes of the film summarizes all the films that you may have missed: Virus, bad mutants. Alice, good mutant. And something about the red queen.In our soon to be released video game based on the film, the main character (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a strange location wearing a skimpy towel. There will be a nude patch that you can download for the game that the manufacturer will swear it had nothing to do with. You then have 2 minutes to find your clothes and escape during a computer failure, one that is poorly designed and defaults to open the door and return your clothes. Once outside you will need to quickly locate weapons and kill low level mutants to level up. You are then forced to return to the facility. Here you team up with someone (Bingbing Li) who looks like Tifa Lockhart (FF VII). You gather as may weapons as you can. Make sure to take extra weapons to arm any future new members of your party.You now have 2 hours to escape the underground area by passing through models of various cities. You kill mutants for points and save humans who you can add to your party while you go to the rendezvous location to meet up with your rescue squad. Due to the cloning nature of the facility you can meet up with people from previous films who couldn't possibly be here. The film ends at a point where we can have a CG sequel and video game.5 star movie if you love watching someone else play a video game.Parental Guide: I don't recall any F-bombs, although don't hold me to that. No sex. No nudity, but skimpy outfits",Resident Evil - Retribution
4,kosmasp,Lots of style and action,5,3 January 2013,"So there is not a lot of story in this. Are you really surprised? What made you think there would be a huge grand story hidden somewhere here? If that's what you're expecting, well you will be more than disappointed. If you go into this expecting to be entertained with great CGI and some good 3-D effects (better than the previous movie, obviously the technical advances come into effect, still not as good as in animated movies of course!).You'll get some familiar faces (the reason why is explained pretty neat) and some deja vus thrown in. But it's not a best of, of what happened until now. It's a stepping stone to the next movie (don't tell me you didn't see that one coming either!). And it looks like that one might actually fulfill some of what people thought this would be like ...",Resident Evil - Retribution
5,jboothmillard,Resident Evil: Retribution,4,28 November 2015,"The film series based on the survival horror video games has been mixed, the first film is great, the second is crap, the third is alright and so is the fourth, I expected the same reaction to this fifth instalment, directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, AVP: Alien vs. Predator, Death Race, Pompeii). Basically it picks up straight after the events of the previous film, the T-Virus, created by the Umbrella Corporation, continues to ravage the Earth turning all infected into dangerous flesh-eating zombies. Alice (Milla Jovovich) continues to hunt those responsible for the outbreak, but following an explosion on a freighter she finds herself in Umbrella Corporation's underground facility, and her former ally Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) is being mind-controlled through a scarab device on her chest. Alice gets her chance to escape when a power failure occurs, she encounters Ada Wong (Bingbing Li), a top agent of Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), it is revealed that the Red Queen of the Hive has been reactivated and now controls Umbrella, and manufactured clones were created to simulate the outbreak of the T-Virus, to sell it at a high price around the world. To help them infiltrate the facility and escape, a strike team organised by Wesker arrives to join Alice and Ada, they are Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand) and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). They have two hours to escape before an explosive device is detonated, the only way to get out is through the simulation scale versions of major cities from around the world, including suburban Raccoon City, New York City and Moscow, Russia. Along the way Alice and the others encounter not only Umbrella troops and undead creatures and evolved monsters, they also encounter clones of deceased allies, including good and evil versions of Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez), soldier Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and commando team leader James ""One"" Shade (Colin Salmon). These clones were created with only a proportion of previous memories to make their reactions to simulations as realistic as possible, they find Alice herself was also cloned, and in her clone life she was a housewife, living with husband Todd (Oded Fehr) and deaf daughter Becky (Orphan's Aryana Engineer). The team find Becky on the way and original Alice takes her with them, taking the place as her mother, and after all the encounters with the ruthless troops, dangerous undead creatures and releasing Jill from her controlled state, they make it out before the explosion. In the end Alice is met by Wesker in the barricaded White House, he restores her superhuman abilities, created by her mutation with the T-Virus, Wesker explains that they need her as the ultimate weapon to join human in the last stand against the hostility of the undead and the Red Queen threatening to wipe out the human race. Also starring Robin Kasyanov as Sergei, Ofilio Portillo as Tony and Megan Charpentier as The Red Queen (voiced by Ave Merson-O'Brian). Jovovich (also director Anderson's wife) with her vigour and visual appeal is still the big draw to sustain proceedings, all the supporting cast are fine as well, I agree the action just continues repeating in each film, the zombies remain relatively scary, the special effects are well done, but you are not highly bothered by the storyline, it is just cool for the fight scenes, guns and explosions all over the place, and blood spilling, apart from that it's another average science-fiction thriller. Okay!",Resident Evil - Retribution
6,Tweekums,Can Alice escape from the Umbrella Corporation?,6,9 May 2017,"After the events of the previous, fourth, instalment in the franchise Alice is a captive of the sinister Umbrella Organisation. She escapes from the room she had been held in with the help of Ada Wong. Ada tells her that her erstwhile enemy Albert Wesker no longer works for the Umbrella Corporation. Umbrella is now run but the 'Red Queen'. It is explained that Alice is being held at a large underground facility in what was once a Soviet submarine base on the remote Kamchatka Peninsula. The base is a test facility that contains accurate reconstructions the centres of New York, Tokyo and Moscow as well as the suburbs of Racoon City. Alice and Ada are to work their way through the facility to meet up with a commando team that is coming to rendezvous with them. As they progress Alice turns that Umbrella has been using the zones to test various 'biohazards' on a clone populations. Some of these clones are based on Alice and as they pass through the suburbs she meets Becky, the daughter of one such clone, and determines to rescue her.This film is very much about bridging the gap between the fourth and the final instalments of the series; knowing this is a bit of a problem as no matter what the threat or how bad things look we know Alice will ultimately survive. The other characters were okay but weren't really developed enough to care about. It isn't all bad of course; I liked the character of Becky, she reminded me of Newt from 'Aliens' and I did care about her survival. There is lots of action; the fight scenes are really rather good as were the various monster attacks. However the CGI effects are a bit too obvious at times just because a film is inspired by a video game doesn't mean that it should occasionally look like one! The cast do a decent enough job. Overall this is far from great but it is a decent enough way to pass an hour and a half if you enjoyed the previous films in the series.",Resident Evil - Retribution

8,BA_Harrison,Haters gonna hate.,8,11 December 2012,"Director Paul W.S. Anderson and the Resident Evil films get a lot of hate, mostly from gamers who aren't happy with the way the story has been adapted for screen, but for me the whole series has been consistently entertaining, light on logic perhaps but heavy on the mayhem, with Anderson's latest offering, Retribution, being no exception.From the visually stunning credits sequence—Alice battling the Umbrella Corp in reverse slo-mo—to the apocalyptic finalé that looks like Hell on Earth, the film is non-stop popcorn fun, packed full of impressive action sequences, stunning special effects, excellent monsters, cool weaponry, and some very lovely ladies in impossibly tight battle dress. And as long as Milla and her sexy co-stars keep on slipping into figure-hugging outfits to do battle with corporate soldiers and hideous mutated zombies, I'll keep on watching.Admittedly, this one feels less like a film and more like a video game than previous installments, the action moving mechanically from one scenario to the next, each presenting new dangers for Alice and her pals, but it is done with such energy and visual flair that it never proves boring. The film also offers up the rather appealing idea that The Umbrella Corp have been cloning employees to populate their massive testing grounds, keeping thousands of specimens in storage waiting to be activated. I'd like an Ada Wong and an Alice if there are any going spare! 7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Resident Evil - Retribution
9,paul_haakonsen,"This was just wrong, oh-so-wrong...",4,30 November 2012,"Wow, and just when you think it couldn't go any more wrong...This movie was utter rubbish story-wise, plot-wise and character-wise. Basically, now everyone is a clone in the movie, or they have super-human abilities, which has gotten to the point where it is just painful to witness and has become a parody of itself.The zombies in the movie, well they are either fast and agile, running around like marathon sprinters, or they have mutated tentacles sprouting from their mouths. And the licker, well it is abnormally large now, but oddly enough, still surprisingly easy to defeat. And let's not forget the giants with the giant archaic weapons. What is up with that? It was just stupid on a level that was offensive to everyone. And, of course, let's just finish off the movie with some strange mutated flying creature, because all the previous messed up stuff wasn't enough.The story in ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is the worst in the series so far, and it has gotten to the point where it has become an abomination and downright ludicrous. It has strayed so far from the core essentials of the Resident Evil legacy (much like the video games have done, as well) and it is all about super-humans, grotesque mutants and clones!Was it nice to have old characters revisited from previous movies? No! Was it a good idea to let the audience believe that they were clones and apparently always had been? No! Did it work out on any level that The Red Queen was brought back into the frame and that a crappy CGI animation appeared with a sinister-little-girl's voice to do evil deeds? No!I had very little expectations for this movie, as the movie franchise has been steadily sliding down a steep downward slope since part two. And this movie does absolutely nothing, and I do mean nothing, to try to correct upon the downfall or the horrible mutation that the movies themselves have turned into.Well, it wasn't all bad. The action scenes and sequences were actually nice enough, well executed and nice enough to look at - if you can cope with the uncanny jumping abilities and super-human strength most of them seemed to possess.""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is a shallow action movie that tries to stay afloat with its 3D effects and on the fact that it bears the name ""Resident Evil"". As a fan of the first three games and the first two movies, I could only sit here shocked and horrified, shaking my head in complete disbelief at what this had turned into.If you like zombie movies, then ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is not a very good choice to sit down and watch. Was it a good addition to the franchise? Well I believe I hardly have to state that here (just read above).With the pain and embarrassment of this movie, I dread what the next one will be like.",Resident Evil - Retribution
10,zardoz-13,Zombie Heaven,9,16 September 2012,"The fifth installment of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" gives new meaning to the old saying: ""A woman's work is never done."" Actress Milla Jovovich cavorts in her trademark skin-tight, black outfit, wields automatic weapons which rarely run out of bullets, and performs more astonishing gravity-defying stunts in some rather exotic new locales. Indeed, this outlandish science fiction fantasy series about an evil corporation gone amuck should have run out of steam several sequels ago. Nevertheless, writer and director Paul W.S. Anderson knows how to keep things exciting, and ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" represents another apex in the world of the Umbrella Corporation versus Alice. Basically, despite its tie-in with the Capcom survivalist video game, the ""Resident Evil"" movies are about Alice in zombie land versus some seriously mutated zombies along with some other medieval looking villains. This time around Anderson addresses the usual problem that plagues any film franchise which has endured as long as the ""Resident Evil"" epics. Remember, the first ""Resident Evil"" appeared ten years ago! If you haven't seen the first film or the previous installment, how do you know what is going on? Anderson's answer is simplicity itself. He presents us with an wealth of back story during this nimble R-rated actioneer's first quarter hour. ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" resumes where ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" concluded. This gives Anderson the opportunity to hit 'replay' and we are treated to the last scene from the previous movie ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"" shown in reverse as well as forward. As repetitive as this may seem, the scene aboard the Umbrella Corporation's Arcadia freighter where Alice and company are having the firefight of the century with hundreds of sinister Umbrella helicopters is worth a rewind or two.After the superb battle on the supertanker from the previous ""Resident Evil"" opus, Anderson presents an informative but never loquacious recap of the entire franchise with Alice summarizing the saga everything. Anybody who either missed or shunned earlier ""Resident Evil"" entries will know what their bearings are when ""Retribution"" unfolds its own narrative. The chief villains in this entry are the Red Queen herself as well as her former friend Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) who sports a red scarab on her chest that controls her. As the action opens, we find our indestructible heroine living a perfectly normal existence with a handsome hubby Carlos (Oded Fehr of ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" and ""Extinction"") and their hearing impaired daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer of ""Orphan"") in suburban America. No sooner have we gotten acclimated to this picture of domestic bliss than zombies burst out of nowhere and pursue them. What comes as an even greater surprise is that during her flight from these ravenous undead cadavers, Alice encounters her old friend Rain (Michelle Rodriguez of ""The Fast and the Furious"") who gives both her daughter and her a lift before the fleet-footing zombies can chomp her. Unfortunately, Rain doesn't survive this early foray and Alice runs smack into husband who has become a zombie. Afterward, Alice awakens in an Umbrella Corporation interrogation room and she is dressed much the same way she was at the end of the first movie. Alice's nemesis Jill wants to know who Alice is working for and Alice wants Jill to remember who she once worked for before the Red Queen slapped a red scarab on her cleavage. Just when the Umbrella baddies think that they have Alice cornered, somebody shorts out the system and gives Alice the opportunity to slip into something more combative and resume her crusade against the Red Queen. The Red Queen is a nasty urchin with a British accent who keeps reminding Alice that she will kill her. Meantime, the resistance forces battling the Umbrella Corporation have to blast their way into a former Soviet submarine base where the Umbrella Corporation have constructed sophisticated mock-ups of Tokyo, Moscow, New York City, and the White House in Washington. The only adversaries AWOL from this ""Resident Evil"" are the undead Dobermans. At the same time, Anderson has brought back a giant galloping monster along with two tall guys with gigantic mallets that look like meat tenderizers.The interesting thing about this ""Resident Evil"" entry is that Anderson never allows us to lose sight of the plot. Good movies are like a car with bright headlights penetrating the murk on a dark road. You always see where you are going, and Anderson inserts numerous recaps to keep us abreast of where we are. Anderson also stages several acrobat fights that look genuinely exciting. Indeed, Alice rarely runs out of adversaries to shoot. At one point, our heroine actually runs out of bullets, but she indulges in a little battlefield salvage and appropriates some firearms from a fallen ally who was gulped by a huge, four-legged leviathan that also gobbled her daughter. Yes, I know, this sounds like ""Aliens,"" but the child-in-jeopardy plot still works. The only thing that Anderson does that has been done already is his use of x-ray shots of bones being broken during a fight; this was first done in ""Romeo Must Die."" Eventually, Alice runs into an old adversary, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who has some dastardly ideas up his sleeve. Wesker once commanded the Umbrella Corporation. He appears here to bring Alice full circle with a revelation that stuns her.Most 3-D action movies amount to a painful experience. Comparatively, the 3-D version of ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" looks pretty spectacular. Apparently, Anderson is the one of the few director who understands 3-D concerns objects, whether an ax or a bullet, flying at the audience. Too many of today's 3-D movies are content to depict action in an environment with depth but not dimension. ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is an above-average 3-D fantasy that gives you a reason to wear those infuriating spectacles. Skillfully staged action scenes, a slam-bang tomandandy soundtrack, and inventive production designs as well as settings make ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" worth watching.",Resident Evil - Retribution
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Yes, we do deserve to get back at someone over this",5,18 January 2014,"After utterly failing to live up to the epic cliffhanger the previous one had(adding another to the long list of negative series trademarks), Alice(Jovovich, tough killing machine, like everyone else in this, except she's the only competent one – also, since she's female, sexy, as well. And making up for Afterlife, this one has plenty of her naked, possibly more than the first three combined) wakes up. Several times(presumably to encourage the audience to do the same). She's stuck in an Umbrella(who I swear are part of Aperture, or the other way around – their resource-spending is unbelievably wasteful. Only here, it's not meant to be laughed at. The actual attempts at humor here are trying too hard) facility, has to get herself and others out, the Red Queen is trying to kill her, you know the drill. Yes, this is like the first one, only complete nonsense. It adds in remaining fan favorite characters from the game, and they only share appearance and name with their counterparts. No one has personality in this.This plays like watching someone play a poor VG – it's all action. Worse still, these set-pieces are overlong, usually uninspired(or rip-offs of better originals, that aren't even passable), and we simply do not care. There's almost no continuity between these, as they change their focus, direction and style. And this certainly doesn't try to give us something to feel anything about. Shoot-outs lack drive, ignore cover and/or has no one ever get hit, fights fare a little better, on account of good choreography and stunt-work. FX are quite well-done, including practical ones. I did not watch this theatrically(it didn't come out in Denmark), so I can't comment on the 3D, but it looks like it might have been enjoyable(if entirely obvious, and like a ride). There are far too many ""faces"" in this, we're meant to get attached when all we do is recognize them. Clones and simulations explain people coming back from the dead and including Tokyo, New York and Moscow, whilst addressing none of the compelling concepts brought up, and raising more questions than it answers. This barely reaches 82 minutes not counting the end credits(if you do, it's 91), feeling far longer, and somehow finding no place in there for plot or relevance.The DVD comes with two interesting commentary tracks with Paul W.S. Anderson: #1 joined by Milla and Boris Kodjoe for funny MST3King, #2 with producer Jeremy Bolt, the informational 6 and a half minutes featurette(that contains spoilers) Drop (Un)Dead: The Creatures of Retribution, 4 and a half minutes of hilarious Outtakes, and trailers for BluRay, Resident Evil: Damnation, Total Recall(2012) and Premium Rush.

12,view_and_review,No Retribution,3,23 January 2017,"The Resident Evil series jumped the shark with Afterlife and I thought Retribution would be just that: retribution. I thought they'd use this movie as a means of making amends, righting the wrongs, correcting the blunders and all that good stuff. Instead they laid another egg. Again the acting was poor, the story half-brained and the fight sequences putrid. There was nothing redeeming about exposed gun fights with high powered automatic weapons yielding no target hits (besides the faceless goons), or the slow motion, bordering paranormal fight sequences that were horribly choreographed and terribly executed. And is it too much to show someone actually running when they're running? You know: arms moving, head bobbing, face contorted with heavy breathing and other known characteristics associated with running. Instead we get glamour running. Hair neatly flowing in the wind, face at ease and arms and legs moving symmetrically all in slo-mo. This movie did nothing to atone for Afterlife. This was no retribution.",Resident Evil - Retribution

14,neil-476,Poor,6,4 October 2012,"Professional survivor Alice (who may or may not be the original or a clone) continues to be a nuisance to the Umbrella Corporation as she struggles to escape from yet more flesh-eating infected zombies, this time in a huge undersea simulation area, where she has to meet up with a small rescue squad who have set bombs to blow the place up in 90 minutes (coincidentally, just about the duration of the rest of the movie).I suppose that this tripe is entertaining enough if you put your brain on hold, but it has no substance whatsoever beyond its video game ethos of destroying hordes of identikit zombies in different locations (with no great sense of jeopardy for the main character). Milla Jovovich leaps about a lot and does lots of shooting (as do all the non-zombies), Michelle Rodrigues and a couple of others put in fairly thankless reappearances, there are gallons of CGI blood, and some unanswered questions which point up some fairly fundamental flaws (why build an enormous underwater base under an ice shelf? Why arrange a rendezvous point which means hanging around waiting while a bomb is counting down when you both have maps and know what direction you're both coming from? Why arrange for a helicopter to pick you up from an ice shelf when you're about 100 yards from land? How does Anna not die of hypothermia having spent 10 minutes unconscious in sub-zero temperature while wearing only a slinky red dress?).The 3D is irrelevant - effective here and there, but mostly not.This is lowest common denominator filmmaking of the worst kind - utterly formulaic, and with nothing to recommend it other than the formula.",Resident Evil - Retribution
15,anaconda-40658,No Retribution Here.,3,14 September 2015,"Resident Evil: Retribution (2012): Dir: Paul W.S. Anderson / Cast: Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez, Sienna Guillory, Li Bingbing, Shawn Roberts: The fifth and unfortunately not the final showcase of this sh*t box franchise. Its subtitle regards the mending of losses although the ending pretty much sidelines any hope of that. It is just another excuse for mindless violence with people getting mauled by zombie or demonic type creatures. Milla Jovovich is a symbol of hope and is a real trooper to go through the routine again. She looks great in her skin tight black sex suit where she pulls out revolvers and large knives. She is still fighting that pesky Umbrella Corporation and the hit is out on Miss Milla who can scrap with the best of them. In fact, we have lots of feisty females in this gem. Michelle Rodriguez growls and spits bullets out her finger tips. Then she beats the tar out of two guys who just don't know when to quit. Sienna Guillory is under some sort of trance and is helping the Umbrella crew and the laughable Red Queen. She will engage in a nifty fist fight with Jovovich in the ice cold. Then we have Li Bingbing as a contact who helps Jovovich until she gets her ass caught. With the exception of Jovovich, these characters are airheads with no intention of doing anything remotely intelligent. The special effects are great with its reds and whites, and director Paul W.S. Anderson delivers an effective slow motion action opener, but his Three Musketeers is far more fun. So, the subtitle lies. There is no real retribution. Not even for the audience who must suffer through this and another bloody geek show. Score: 3 ½ / 10",Resident Evil - Retribution

This is all to do with the well-reasoned tactic of making this a full-on Action film for the majority of its running time and making the horror come from what's doing all the chasing. The action is pretty much relentless here without much let-up as this is packed with nearly every kind of action here with chases, martial arts, gun-play and stunt-work that almost all the encounters result in and makes for a highly enjoyable time. The initial sequence overrunning the suburban locale as there's all sorts of ravenous zombies infiltrate the house leading to plenty of fun here going throughout the different rooms in a fun, lengthy chase before the escape from the horde outside, the encounter on the car-lined city streets with the blade-wielding monstrous behemoths is an explosive blast with all the crashes, stunt- work and furious fights which is great fun while the big scene here is the gunfight in the computer store that turns into a thrilling car-chase with soldier-zombies and a hulking dog-like gorilla among other monstrosities human and non-human that all offer up plenty of explosive fun which are part of what makes this one so much fun. There's also plenty of fun to be had in the finale as there's even more action here in the massive gunfight in the bay-docks that comes off incredibly well, the chase after the hulking beast is a suitable diversion and there's the exceptionally fun brawling at the end where there's plenty of fine martial-arts brutal action give it enough to matter highly. The other big factors here come from the continuation of this one going for the series' trademark of fantastic creatures and monstrosities that look really great and creepy which makes for quite a fine time, providing enough gore to satisfy as all of these are enough to overcome the lone flaw in this. The one factor to hold this one down is it's absolutely lame CGI used here for the 3D gags and other scenes, oftentimes coming in unnecessarily which proves to be quite a distraction or taking so long to occur that it's possible to forget it was supposed to be one anyway. Beyond this issue, there's more positives than negatives here and overall make this among the best in the series.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.",Resident Evil - Retribution

But soon she realises that she is in an Umbrella computer security system shuts-down and Alice flees to the central control room of the facility. She meets Ada Wong, who works with Albert Wesker, and she learns that a five-man team has been sent by Wesker to rescue them. However, the Red Queen sends Jill Valentine and Rain to hunt them down......RE: Retribution, may as well have been called Reunion, because most of the cast from previous movies are in this, even though they look and act brainwashed ala The Manchurian Candidate.Other than that, the film is the pits, it's bad, and makes the rest of the RE movies look like the Harry Potter movies. The other movies were bad too, but at least there was some fun to be had.Jovovich looks bored of doing silly jumps and Martial Arts, and the rest of the cast look like they are being held at gun-point.The film makes no sense, even if you watch the other movies before hand, and the effects are poor, even for Anderson.The soundtrack though is really good, especially during the Ice Fight toward the end of the movie, but everything else is pointless.And there will be another one too....",Resident Evil - Retribution
18,Aaron1375,"While I did not enjoy this one quite as much as the previous three, I still enjoyed it",8,22 January 2013,"I need to hang my head in shame for enjoying this film as much as I did as I can see by the score here that most people did not care for it. However, I did enjoy it...I thought it was a fun, fast and action packed movie. It did not overstay its welcome and had a lot of fun within. Milla is back and she does what she usually does in these films, kick a lot of butt. Also back are a few old friends...I saw their names in the cast and I was unsure how some of them would come back, but I thought they did a good enough job reintroducing them.Alice has been caught by umbrella as she has to once again escape one bizarre installation. She receives help from the mysterious Ada Wong and from another surprising source. They must battle their way out of an underground hive facility in Russia...this facility being so huge it has areas that look like a Tokyo street, a suburban environment and a Russian area too. A group of mercenaries has also been commissioned to help the two girls out. So prepare for lots of action and lots of zombies and of course lots of wtf creatures too.The Resident Evil films, to me, are like those old serials of the 30's, 40's and 50's. Do not take it too seriously and sit back and enjoy the show. Heck, most of the films of this series are an hour and 30 minutes usually so they are short and do not take forever to get started and have no sections where nothing is happening. You get your surprising revelations, that you know could not be possible, but that is the fun of it. You start looking for plot flaws and of course you are going to find them, just like the old serials of yesteryear. I also enjoy how they pick up where the last film leaves off, and for a series with a relatively low budget compared to other films, at least they can keep bringing back the same actors and actresses to play the parts...'cough' Batman 'cough, cough'.So yes, I enjoyed this film quite a bit. At times I do feel the series relies to much on computer generated effects, but so do most movies these days. I kind of wish they would go back to making monster effects using rubber and stuff found in a normal household. While I did enjoy the film a lot, I did not like it as much as part two, three and four. I do hope they make another one, but it should be the last one...period. Have a conclusion as sooner or later these things are going to stop making enough money to justify a sequel, and it would be so annoying for the series to stop and leave those of us who enjoy it hanging.",Resident Evil - Retribution
19,trashgang,"great effects, same story as always",7,19 February 2013,"I always found the Resident Evil franchise very weird to watch. And this is no exception. The effects were always very important and a lot of CGI was/is used but I can take it in such kind of flicks. This part, number 5 already picks in exactly were Resident Evil: afterlife (2010) stopped. And for those who never seen a Resident flick the opening after the credits explains what has happened before. But just watch the opening. All shown in slo-mo and played backwards. Wow, this I liked very much. And that's what it is all about again. The effects. The story itself is seen before. Alice confused and being attacked, then wakes up at Umbrella as always naked only covered with a small piece. From there she's out to rescue the world again. This time shot in the newest 3D technology. Blu ray players will need to update to see it and it looked great. There's even a small joke hidden for the 3D viewers when some weapon is thrown and really comes towards you, you can even here you throat being sliced by it. All characters do reappear again here. And new creatures are hunting for victims. I liked it maybe because it clocked in at 95 minutes, sio the action is all around.Milla Jovovich looked great in her as they say throughout the movie stunning in her SM outfit. I admit, it's the same movements and slo-mo as seen before in other Residents but you like it or not, I did looking out for number 6 already announced...Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",Resident Evil - Retribution
20,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Resident Evil: Retribution,6,13 September 2012,"Is there really a need for another Resident Evil movie? Writer-director Paul W.S. Andersen had come out to categorically state the next film will probably be the final one, and the finale in Retribution is pointing straight at it, but whether or not it will be made will depend on how well this film does. It'll likely make a lot of money, or enough to warrant a green light, but what a chore it was to sit through this film, which I rank probably the second worst of the lot after Apocalypse.It started off where we last left off, with Milla Jovovich's Alice losing her superhuman powers obtained in the last few films, and facing a full scale assault on board a ship, led by Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). There was some unnecessary time wasting to provide the opening credits in slow motion, played to tomandandy's score which will pepper the entire movie frequently, for obvious lack of aural creativity, but who knew that would be ominous to what's coming up ahead in this installment, which made it seem too generic, and an unnecessary addition to the mythos thus far. The opening credits gave way to Alice giving a quick lowdown summary of what had transpired since the first film, which was good given that it is now 10 years since the start.But then it went downhill from there. It seems that Andersen ran into writer's block, and with shooting deadline looming, decided to bring us full circle thematically to Episode 1, with Alice waking up in captivity in similar skimpy, well, non-existent costume, before it becomes a mad escape from the confines of an Umbrella Corporation facility, this time a testing grounds for the development of the T-virus. Help comes in the most unlikely form of Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), and his trusted agent Ada Wong (Li Bingbing), with whom Alice must join forces in order to evade the clutches of The Red Queen (Megan Charpentier, voiced by Ave Merson-O'Brian), which had taken over Umbrella the time that Alice was knocked out.Needless plot arcs involve the assembling of a motley crew of mercenaries, which included some characters from the past for a rescue and extraction mission, but you know it's all a smokescreen given that the Resident Evil films have always been girl power, so they were bound for the casualty list sooner or later. And gun fights are just plain ordinary again, ducking and shooting, and the planting of explosives just to pad the film out a little longer as they battle faceless, uniformed Umbrella foot soldiers, because the Alice-Ada half involved more CG creatures and environments that resemble modern day cities, and suburbia, which probably had cost more. And it's interesting that the Suburbia landscape was the most out of place, if only to allow Juvovich to celebrate her motherhood with Alice's daughter Becky(Aryana Engineer) thrown in for a small emotional arc, proclaiming something she would do in a real life parallel in never leaving a daughter behind no matter what.Scenes seem to be haphazardly pasted together, with fight sequences done for the sake of, lest someone complains about the lack of action, especially involving Alice kicking serious ass. Scenes bring your attention to something, then get quickly forgotten or are inconsequential, such as the injury Alice sustained that got us looking at her blood stained palms, twice. The zombies here are few and far between, with one dedicated scene early on having Alice obliterating a Japanese zombie mob with chain and handgun, just for the sake of to prove she hasn't lost her edge, and probably to allow this film to world premiere in Tokyo. Fight sequences only picked up when they involve close quarter combat, and while the final big battle felt like an afterthought not to shortchange audiences given the rather plain and admittedly boring, stuffy moments, it was the best in the film, where Alice goes up against Jill Valentine, and Michelle Rodriguez's Rain, or one of many test clones imprinted with some basic memory, as explained in the film, going up against Leon Kennedy (Johann Urb) and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). You'd have to last almost 80 minutes of mediocrity though, to get to this point.Resident Evil is actually about ogling at Milla Jovovich for 90 minutes, and in the IMAX 3D version, if her complexion is left digitally untouched, it's almost flawless, proportional, and silky smooth beautiful. Kicking ass becomes secondary here since the actress has perfected it for five films already, although her Alice here somehow lacked the spunk found in the earlier versions, as if already tired from yet another installment that didn't seem to go anywhere, until the epilogue that teased of a more hopeful sequel / final installment. Li Bingbing was supposed to be the other highlight, being the first Asian female to grace the franchise, but having limited screen time, her role was only made memorable in being appointed the details spokesperson using almost halting English, and perfecting the Angelina Jolie inspired sticking-the-right-leg-out-of-her-dress look, with every scene always requiring that pose. It's also a nice welcome back for Michelle Rodriguez, but having nothing much to do, pretty much makes it a boring comeback.Still, I don't see how this installment would deter its fan base, both from film and the video game. One can only hope that should another film be made, it'd be a lot more promising from where this movie left us off with a big setup for an all out war. To end the franchise here would make it incomplete, so hopefully Andersen can up his ante and deliver an ending worthy to sum up the franchise with. With a heavy heart, I'd say non fans may want to skip this movie because it doesn't add anything to the ongoing franchise, unless you'd like to watch Milla in action as her most enduring character yet.",Resident Evil - Retribution
21,siderite,Death by User eXperience,5,7 October 2012,"This part of the Resident Evil franchise is the quintessential Apple generation movie: it looks perfect, with thin lines and swiping motions, but it doesn't do much. They removed any screenwriter from the equation and replaced them all with XD (Experience Design) people. Except a few situations with zombies and undead monsters (that may or may not have been real anyway), it wasn't horror either.So what are we left with? Milla Jovovich is still gorgeous and we even see her partly naked. I guess that was the highlight of the film. The script is ridiculous, the special effects are over the top, but not in a good way, and they finally attempted to mix together elements from the game, the animated films and the motion picture movies by bringing Leon and Ada and Barry (and removing any semblance of a story). Only they were superfluous and could just as well have not been there. Oh, and they show mutalisks at the end...Conclusion? (in the dub step soundtrack that ends the film) It feels like you would see someone playing a really dumb game. It looks pretty good, but you can't play it, you can only watch. You wait for a few minutes, then you just screw it all, get a tablet and google for pictures of Milla.",Resident Evil - Retribution
22,KineticSeoul,Few entertaining scenes but overall a really really dumb zombie/action movie,4,3 November 2012,"Okay so Paul W.S. Anderson really didn't seem to care much about this franchise as long as it's a cash in. And it really really shows with this one. Cause out of every ""Resident Evil"" movie in this franchise which is based on a video game series has almost nothing to do with the games. The plot is the most stupid one in this franchise and there is just way too many obvious plot-holes. In fact some of the audiences walking out even couples were talking about how dumb this movie is. Yeah for how dumb this movie is, it does have few entertaining action parts. But by giving credit for that would be complimenting all of Michael Bay movies. Just throw in bunch of actions and explosions that is incoherent to the story kinda deal. This time it introduces three new characters from the video games to this movie. But they just have the same name and similar attire and that is it. The characteristics and mannerism of these characters are so different from the video games. They even look very different. Leon S. Kennedy is suppose to be this cocky, reserved and sarcastic character that does everything it takes to get the mission accomplished and yet he is likable and cool. But in this he comes off as sorta a doofus and a bit too tall to be Leon. Ada Wong is suppose to be this sly, manipulative character and also sassy and is proficient in what she does. But in this she comes off bland and confused. Her character seemed more like Sherry Birkin. And lastly Barry Burton is nothing like the game character with the slow and yet corny lines he is suppose to have. If they are gonna make a corny movie at least give it to characters that have those characteristics. There is just way too many pointless slow-mo scenes, some critics bash on Zack Snyder for using slow-mo in his movies. I personally thinks he uses well for the most part that actually makes the scene more invigorating. That isn't the case here, and there is pointless kung-fu. The main protagonist Alice uses Kung-fu or whatever on the zombies and than shoots them in the head. Seriously what the crap. And that is not all, the list is almost endless. If your in the mood for a really really dumb zombie movie with lots of action this might be for you. I am guilty to say I was entertained by few scenes. The way this one ends there might be one or two more left in this franchise before it gets rebooted. There is also a partial nude scene with Milla Jovovich like in all of these live action ""Resident Evil"" movies and it got a bit tiresome.4/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
23,cherold,"Weakest Film in Series, But It Would Make a Terrific Video Game",6,7 January 2013,"The Resident Evil movies have for years been a source of mindless popcorn fun, stylish, violent and fast paced. Retribution follows the same basic pattern, but it doesn't do it quite as well, resulting in a movie with some entertaining sequences that winds up feeling rather pointless and very nonsensical.The film begins very well, with a big battle shown backwards in slow-mo. This is followed by a purposefully disorienting scene and then a few minutes of the traditional sight of Milla half-naked. Then we get some more wild, puzzling action scenes.So far, so good.The central gimmick behind the varied locations of the movie, which include the suburbs and Tokyo, allows for some cool scenes, but also put the movie in danger of feeling episodic, a danger blithely ignored by the director. It is also one of these gimmicks that doesn't make much sense, and as the movie progresses, the number of things that don't make sense multiply. The movie also has the least character development of any in the series, which is saying a lot.This should not be a movie, this should be a video game. Video games, for better or worse, have low story requirements, and work well in an episodic format. In fact, the ""greatest hits"" quality of the action, which brings back old locations and old monsters, reminded me of the game The Umbrella Chronicles.I still found this fairly entertaining, although I was torn between giving it 6 stars or 5. This movie looks like it's a set up for a series finale, but I'm not sure if the makers have any fresh ideas left for another movie; this one recycles a lot. Still, it wasn't so bad that I won't watch the next one when it comes out.",Resident Evil - Retribution
24,Robert_duder,Still awesome but....,8,23 September 2012,"Resident Evil has become probably my favourite action/horror franchise ever. Each instalment is just non-stop, break neck speed and action and gore and language and R Rated goodness. It is unapologetic in the way that it is connected from sequel to sequel but it never confuses and reminds you of everything going on. I was wary about going to see the fifth instalment because eventually this series has to trip up in my eyes after so many sequels. This was not a trip-up for them at all but it was perhaps a sidestep from greatness. The series has always subtly paid homage to the video game franchise it came from without smacking movie goers in the face with it. As a fan of the video game series as well I was pleased with the increase of video game references in the fourth film but now in this fifth one, they just plow you in the face with the video game connections. The new characters, the ""Los Plagas"" T-virus zombies, and the fact that the entire concept of this film is really one big video game for our heroes and for Alice. The series has also had some very small sprinklings of cheese in them. Certain aspects you thought...that is almost too cheesy but then the epic cool factor buried that. This instalment was outright cheesy at times, with awful delivered lines, a terrible new character that delivers everything dead panned and cheesy, and our main villain Wesker is practically lifted right from the video game (where he has always been incredibly cheesy.) Milla Jovovich returns yet again to play the amazing hero Alice. She has always been breathtaking at this role and she doesn't fail to disappoint. The girl is probably one of actions films best heroes ever. She is still awesome and looks great!! Another great aspect of this sequel was that they were able to bring back some of our favourite characters from past films including Michelle Rodriguez (in a terrific dual role as Good Rain and Bad Rain) and Oded Fehr as Carlos. Newcomers Johann Urb and Kevin Durand play game classic characters Leon Kennedy and Barry Burton. Both of them are okay but very underused. You just don't get attached to them like previous stars from the other films. Boris Kodjoe returns as Luther, who I really liked from the previous film, but he is sort of of underused too but he's still awesome. Aryana Engineer is absolutely brilliant as the young, deaf clone that attaches herself to Alice. She was fantastic and handled the action like a pro. Bingbing Li joins the cast as another game character Ada Wong and she is truly awful. She is the aforementioned cheesy line deliverer and just gives a terrible performance. The scenes between her and Jovovich make her sound and look ridiculous. The forced and pointless romance between her and Leon Kennedy was not fun to watch either. Shawn Roberts is Albert Wesker and I wonder if he was literally directed to act wooden and cheesy just like the Wesker in the game. If that's the case it was an unfortunate turn because Wesker could, can and has been a really killer villain.Director and writer Paul Anderson has done an incredible job on this series. Part horror, part action, part sci-fi and despite some poor casting and character creation and the cheesier lines...this film was still kick butt. The action doesn't stop just like the others. The setting for the film seems hokey but it is sort of a fun idea to have so many multiple locations for zombie killing action. Jovovich's Alice certainly makes this film still incredibly watchable. That and the story is still solid and fun to watch and you want to know exactly where everything is going. The creatures look incredible and the film has a lot of emotion and a lot of heart. Just because this one wasn't a huge 9 for me like the other ones...it was still wicked fun and I still LOVE this series. 8.5/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
25,bowmanblue,Tell me why?,4,31 May 2014,"I liked the first Resident Evil film (and even the - much maligned - second instalment). I sat through numbers three and four then promptly forgot them and now tried number five. I kind of wish I hadn't.Considering it's the fifth in the series, it starts off as if it's trying to reboot itself by being overly clever and bringing back all the dead characters and putting the existing ones in new settings and locations. Maybe I'm just being dim, but it came across as pointless and confusing. Then, when you find out what's really going on, the beginning seems even more unnecessary and serves no purpose other than to fill time.As most people know, the Resident Evil films are based on computer games. Most films based on computer games get a hard ride for trying to make a story out of a medium which isn't really 'narrative-based.' However, this Resident Evil film seems more like a computer game than most games themselves! If you're playing a computer game, you may expect to play one level set in a desert then the next level set in a city, followed by another level in the jungle. And you'd probably think little of it, as that's how video games work. However, films are supposed to be stories and therefore follow some narrative. Resident Evil 5 doesn't. When the confusing and pointless bits are over, you're left with one action scene after another, simply moved to another location.The same baddies run at the same goodies and get kicked or shot to death. I know you have to suspend your disbelief when you're watching films, but this one took it too far. No one ever really runs out of bullets, the baddies (despite being an army) can't hit five men standing in the open, women in spandex can outrun lasers and every time anyone enters a new scene (or should I say 'zone?') they have to stand their posing and posturing before finally getting down to (yet more) action.The film goes on for the usual ninety minutes, however there's only about twenty of those with dialogue in it. Seriously, the script was probably the shortest ever written. Then again... that could be a good thing as the lines are diabolical and the acting even worse.Then, just when you think it can't stoop any lower, it blatantly rips off Aliens with a 'Ripley rescuing Newt' scene.There is no story to see here, just action scenes. You might as well play Streetfighter 2 or Tekken on a games console for all the story you get.I give it 4/10. I would give it 2/10, but the action scenes are well shot and stylish. Paul W S Anderson is clearly a good director who can handle cool visuals. It's just a pity he can't write a good script.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Resident Evil - Retribution
26,ThomasDrufke,The Same Exact Thing All Over Again,4,8 February 2017,"I honestly never thought I'd be sitting in the position to review the 5th, and soon to be 6th, film of the Resident Evil franchise. Usually by the time a franchise is 5 films and over a decade old, the series has gone through many changes and underwent several aesthetic iterations. You'd think they would reinvent the films several times over right? Well, with Resident Evil it's more of the same with every movie.Each film has their entertaining qualities. 'Retribution' has probably the finest action and most polished visual effects of the entire series, but there's nothing under the surface. It should come as no surprise to people familiar with the series as each film holds the same problem, but I'm foolish enough to think the next film will change. Here's hoping that 'The Final Chapter' does more than just impress the eyes.The funny thing is, 'Retribution' plays like it already is the ""final chapter"". Bringing back Michelle Rodriquez, Sienna Guillory, Boris Kodjoe, Oded Fehr, and Shawn Roberts, all of which whose characters were supposedly dead to the franchise. Which brings me to the most frustrating thing about this series. Characters come and go, actors come and go, settings come and go, without any real direction. It seems to me like every time one of these films goes into production they try to gather everyone from the franchise that they can, and then try to write a story around the actors. The story should always come first. This is the reason why when characters die in any Resident Evil film there is no emotional impact. Is it asking too much to develop characters a bit more in an action film?I can't say I can differentiate the plot of this film to any other in the series. Alice is going after Umbrella with the help of her friends and is forced to take on creatures of higher abilities and everyone's lives are at stake. There's nothing new and it's actually likely the least inventive of the series. Some cool action and certainly some polished CGI can save the experience. I guess.+Nice action/CGI-Characters come and go, and who really cares?-The story is exactly the same as it always is4.1/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
27,MLDinTN,"Alice is back, but where's the zombies",5,22 April 2013,"I like the Resident Evil movies, but this was my least favorite one, mainly because there are hardly any zombies. Plus I didn't like them putting Alice back inside the hive. She has escaped the hive in a previous film and has been fighting the zombies on top. Now she's back underground and interacting in different environments underground, like a suburbia neighborhood, Tokoyo, Moscow, New York. Plus the Red Queen is back to trying to kill her and using clones and armies that aren't zombies but I'm still not sure if they were real people. Also, Alice has lost her powers from the previous film, except she can still do all the super human things when it comes to fighting. The story line just didn't flow together. Then it ends set up for the next film, which that part looked really cool.FINAL VERDICT: I'd wait till the next sequel comes out and just watch this and that one back to back.",Resident Evil - Retribution

For those that haven't seen any of them they all tie together so it's best to watch them in order. I will say that this one had the coolest opening of any of them and this one had more of a video game feel then the others as well.

31,851222,"Please, stop doing this trash with amazing title ""Resident Evil""",3,12 January 2013,"Greetings from Lithuania.I'm a big ""Resident Evil"" game fan. To me, first three ""Resident Evil"" games and later fourth were among the best video games ever. I've played first two games hundreds of times. And then the movie came out. The first ""Resident Evil"" film wasn't bad, neither it was good. The second part probably was the best, only because it was the closest to the material. Now with the fifth installment i can safely ask - why in the name of fans they are putting title ""Resident Evl"" in the front of this movie and series? It's NOT the ""Resident Evil"" i know. It's just MIla Jovovich every two years playing some kind of character in some kind a world that somehow supposed to be relative to Resident Evil game franchise. But it's not. They (creators of movie franchise) are just putting names from game series in to a movie series without ANY connection at all. In this fifth movie i saw a character of Barry, from the first ""Resident Evil"". I recognized him just from his costume. But so what? How is he connected to this movie nonsense series at all? ""Resident Evil"" the one i love became some kind a creepy family business (you know what i mean) for a B list star (once an A list star) and a shitty director. Please, STOP. I really hope and inside of me i really believe that one day some good movie maker will reboot this mess that is done now, like Ch.Nolan rebooted Batman. I believe that in rebooted series characters from the game will be CHARACTERS, not just the names thrown in for the marketing purposes. I hope that in rebooted series there will be plot. God, i so hope that after seeing that movie in a theater i will walk out and say, ""you know what, now that was a great ""Resident Evil"" movie. Hey, can you even remember that trashy series now?""",Resident Evil - Retribution

There clearly isn't much to tell in this franchise anymore.From the very confusing opening to the cliffhanger ending, 'Retribution' has very little substance, but plenty - and I mean plenty - of shooting. Many of the familiar characters from previous installments are back (Rain, Carlos, Jill Valentine, Clarence...), but in very different roles. There simply is no way you can watch this and understand what's going on if you haven't seen the previous films. Hell, I've seen them all and I'm still confused!Many of the action and events are simulations, and not real, causing further confusion. Alice now also fulfils another role: that of Mother. Yup, mother! But only because of a memory imprint in a little girl (Becky)'s brain. Her capture and rescue scene is so reminiscent of Newt in 'Aliens', it's almost identical. The action scenes are fast-paced and relentless, so action buffs will have a great time with this movie. As for a sequel to a zombie franchise, it is very disappointing. There are hardly any zombies here, and the story itself is...well, erm... there is no plot, really. It's just running, shooting, fighting, running, shooting, fighting, running... you get the picture.It felt as if the writer/director had too many ideas for one movie - just like 'Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse' - and blended them all together, hoping it would gel. Well, honestly, I'm going to have a difficult time remembering what this film is actually about. It doesn't contribute anything to the series. I will remember all those muscled hunks, though! At least they make the film more watchable. Oh, and Wesker - the ruthless antagonist from 'Resident Evil: Afterlife' - is back, as well, but this time to help Alice.. Ok, talk about confusing...!",Resident Evil - Retribution

It packs with a wild and confusing beginning. But it all makes sense mins later. The movie is one wild thrill ride. Which it never slows down with the action. The movie moved very fast with each action set pieces. Paul Anderson script and direction made this movie a fun one. The cast ensemble is great. The visual effects are awesome. The music score by Tomandandy is beautifully done. One of the best in the series. The climax delivered one awesome fight scene.

35,TheMovieDiorama,Resident Evil: Retribution is my guilty pleasure chapter of the series.,5,24 February 2018,"Maybe I'm getting softer. Or maybe this franchise has numbed the critiquing cortex in my brain...yes, it's definitely that. The more times I watch this chapter, the more I'm finding it to be a guilty pleasure. Don't get me wrong, it's still bad and just has the odious whiff of Paul W.S. Anderson. Poor and utterly cheesy dialogue blended with the occasional bad CGI and 3D gimmicky nonsense. The plot is so convoluted that everyone is being brought back as clones or are somehow still alive. I don't know...I just go with it now. However, despite all this I do find enjoyment in the small crevices. Those cracks being the musical score (which is the best in the series by far) and the supporting characters that actually have a tiny bit more personality. Ada Wong and Leon Kennedy's actors have less range than a ticking metronome, but reintroducing past characters felt rather nostalgic. Visual effects have improved dramatically. Milla Jovovich keeps on increasing her ""badassery"". The final fight scene is the best choreographed action sequence in the series. The editing was abysmal but watching Michelle Rodriguez annihilate two guys in hand-to-hand combat felt satisfying to watch. Retribution went for full on action with sci-fi traits, and to be honest I'm on board now. This franchise has ended me, plus I'm slightly drunk so there...cheers! One more to go!!",Resident Evil - Retribution
36,GOWBTW,"For the die-hards, it's a keeper!",8,14 September 2012,"Milla Jovovich never seems to amaze in this movie. More moves brings out the rough side of her. After being neutralized in RE:Afterlife, Alice (Jovovich) continues to bring down that evil corporation. She would later gain a new ally named Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) who wears a similar dress like Alice in the first series. It was nice when Alice has a daughter named Becky (Aryana Engineer, ""Orphan"") who was involved in an simulation where the undead attack her mom and dad. And of course dealing with the mutants as well. Since the cities were well simulated by Umbrella, The dreaded Red Queen will do everything in her power to stop Alice and her crew. With the return of Luther (Boris Kodjoe) the chances are good. The downside is Rain(Michelle Rodriguez) is a foe. And she really wants to destroy Alice the best she can. The coolest scene for me was the pimped up Rolls Royce Alice drove when she found the team. Slamming that mutant, and driving it to the subway was awesome! This movie was a big turnaround from the last I think. It has plenty of action, a lot of intrigue, and Milla can still kick some serious zombie butt! It has not lost its charm one bit. 3 out of 5 stars",Resident Evil - Retribution
37,jtindahouse,Another bland and unoriginal entry in the series,5,30 January 2017,"I said at the end of the fourth chapter in the 'Resident Evil' series that writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson needed to do something different and fresh with the next two additions. Based on what I saw in 'Resident Evil: Retribution' I think he knew he had to as well, he just didn't know how to do it. This one is the most unique of the first five films, however that doesn't necessarily equate to quality. In fact if anything it ended up making things even more bland than before.The acting in this one was noticeably worse than any other entry in the series. There were some truly horribly delivered lines at times. Milla Jovovich on the other hand continues to be a bright light in the series. She does what she does well. She's likable and pulls of the ""badass"" tag very well. 'Resident Evil: Retribution' is almost certainly the worst entry in the series to date. This film is living proof that this set of films has outstayed its welcome. If you're not adding something to story each time then why are you continuing to the make the films, other than for money? There is still one more film to go, 'The Final Chapter' which I plan to see this week. I can only hope that the series goes out on a high note, and maybe achieves some originality and freshness. Based on this entry though, I'm not going to get my hopes up.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Milla Jovovich is still awesome has Alice, action scenes and fight scenes don't disappoint either. Co stars Sienna Guillory and Michelle Rodriguez are also cool to watch.Now here is where the problems come in, Wesker the villain from the games who finally made an appearance in the third film, is not in it for very long, I was hoping he would have a bigger part, but it was not the case. Some interesting characters seem to get killed off pretty quickly. And the way it was filmed, Seemed very rushed, like they where in a hurry to get the film done. Although not as bad has Afterlife, still has two many flaws that pretty much shake, still alright for those turn your brains off to sci-fi, action, horror.",Resident Evil - Retribution
39,estebangonzalez10,The worst film of the franchise,4,18 September 2012,"¨ My name is Alice, and this is my world. ¨ Resident Evil was in my opinion the best movie adapted from a video game thanks in most part to Milla Jovovich. Almost all other films have failed to make the transition from video game to film, but there was something special about seeing this heroin fighting off the undead. What began as a horror film eventually turned into a nonstop action film in the following sequels: Apocalypse, Extinction, Afterlife, and now in the fifth one Retribution. I enjoyed some of the previous sequels although to a much lesser degree than the original. I was just fascinated with Jovovich's character, Alice, that I didn't mind that Resident Evil was quickly turning into an action franchise. Finally in Retribution I realized it was just getting too old and mind numbing. I was really disappointed with this film, although my expectations were lowered by the previous sequels. I was hoping that since some of the characters from the original film would be back that the film would go back to the horror genre, but instead it was much more action packed than the rest with so many characters that I just lost interest in the film. My love for Alice diminished after the first 30 minutes of Retribution and I was hoping the film would end soon. The acting in this film is terrible (not that it wasn't in the other sequels, but it is even worse here) and I really didn't enjoy any of the characters. The plot was also very hard to follow at first and I feel that every time a new film starts they forget about everything that was left untold in the previous films. It's as if they want these films to stand on their own, but they keep on raising questions and then never answer them.Retribution picks up right where Afterlife ended with Alice (Milla Jovovich) and the few survivors from the apocalyptic world in the Arcadia ship being attacked by planes from the Umbrella Corporation with Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) commanding them. During the attack Alice manages to bring down one of the planes before jumping off the ship to the water. After she awakes we see her locked up somewhere in a clandestine Umbrella facility where she is continually interrogated by Valentine who is receiving orders from the Red Queen (a computer that controls the entire Umbrella system). Then all of a sudden there is a security breach and Alice is able to escape and finds she's in Tokyo or some place similar. She is attacked by the virus infested people and manages to make her way back to the facility. Here she is helped by Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) who tells her she has been held captive by the Red Queen and that she has helped her escape. She also lets Alice know that she was still in the facility and that she just had entered a simulation of Tokyo created by the evil corporation to train their soldiers. Ada works for Alice's enemy, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) who claims to be helping her since he needs her help after having lost control of the corporation. Albert has also sent some other men to rescue her including Luther (Boris Kodjoe), Leon (Johann Urb), and Barry (Kevin Durand). Together they will have to find a way to survive the undead and escape the facility, although the Red Queen has some surprises along the way: Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and One (Colin Salmon) have been cloned and also receive orders from the Queen.Despite being introduced to some of the old characters, in Retribution the Redfield brothers and K-Mart are left out along with several other plot elements. The main problem I had with this Paul W.S. Anderson film was the over abundance of action and characters. It was just too much for me. The best part of the film happened in the beginning in a scene that reminded me a lot of the original and had me fooled it was returning to the horror genre. It was a scene involving Alice waking up in her suburban home along with her daughter Becky (Aryana Engineer) and her husband Todd (Oded Fehr). Everything seemed like it was back to normal until some zombies began invading their home. Those 5 minutes where the most suspenseful and intense moment of the film. I just wished the film would've stayed that way instead of returning to the action packed scenes with hardly any scares or dialogues. It was just one action scene after another and nothing new was added to this film. I was really disappointed with Retribution and it will probably be among my list of the worst movies of the year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Resident Evil - Retribution

She joins with yet another 'group' to try and escape.Whilst the visuals and some set pieces are still nicely done, Anderson appears to have run out of ideas and brings back creatures and characters from the earlier films and dumps any rules of engagement that the franchise once had straight in the bin. The result is a long, messy and illogical crash bang wallop fest for 95 minutes, culminating in an overlong and tedious anti climactic fight sequence on the ice.This film never gets exciting or witty or moving it's just a lot of explosions, guns and zombies.

The movie is undoubtedly spot on for their action scenes and will be a treat for an eyes for the action lovers but apart from action the movie disappoints in a big way.Apart from Milla it seems that rest of the characters are forced to play the part and seems disinterested. The biggest blot was Michelle Rodriguez who did the acting with a blank face.Screenplay of the movie was tight and engaging, background music supports the screenplay beautifully.With pale star cast and their fade acting the movie is certainly a disappointment.",Resident Evil - Retribution
42,kluseba,Quantity instead of quality again,5,4 November 2012,"I've been a big fan of the very first ""Resident Evil"" movie because it had a unique horror film atmosphere, a twisted story and many intriguing characters. When I saw the second film, I was completely disappointed because it only focused on action scenes and had a very depressing and dumb atmosphere all the time. I disliked the film so much that I stopped caring for the sequels. In addition to this, the fascination of the initial concept has just worn out after numerous comics, novels, video games and movies. I feel that only the closed minded die hard fans will continue buying all this stuff and ignoring the lack of quality that has been replaced by an elevated quantity. As it seems, there are still enough of this people around to carry the whole concept on.I only watched this movie by pure coincidence as I passed a weekend with a friend who is a fan of the series and who asked me to go to watch this flick at his cheap local movie theatre with him. This new flick didn't inspire me at all to watch the flicks I've had missed or to continue following the series. It just underlines what I've already expected. The movie is filled with numerous action scenes, cheap effects and ultimately leads to another sequel while the characters have no development and while there is also a complete absence of any story whatsoever.There are still a few good points about this film. First of all, the location of a complex Soviet bunker system somewhere underneath the permafrost of North-East Russia is quite promising and definitely has its charm even if the idea had been used before. The decorations are overall quite stylish and a few shots are in fact very well done. Apart of this, I also enjoyed the simulated places the characters cross in this movie such as Tokyo, New York City or Moscow. These scenes are especially intriguing for people who adore to travel and discover the world as I do and at some moments, there are certain deja-vu effects. As a last point, I might say that I liked the addition of Li Bingbing to the movie. I have seen several Chinese flicks with her before she rose to fame and she definitely is a promising actress. It's sad that she is not acting very much in here in fact just like all the other characters that have no development. She's just there all of a sudden, incarnates a tough woman and shows us her long beautiful legs. That's definitely nice to watch but she has clearly more than just this to offer and the team wasted a lot of promising potential.In the end, this movie seems to be another continuous step down for the Resident Evil universe. There will be more movies but I hope it will stop anytime soon. While the makers of the comparable Underworld saga were able to pull of a quite decent new flick this year, the team behind Resident Evil fails while it tries. Let's hope for an explosive final chapter before the whole thing will finally be brought to an end. I can only recommend this movie to the die hard fans, anyone else should skip this, watch the first and best feature again and discover more movies with Li Bingbing.",Resident Evil - Retribution
43,Sherazade,I'm a fan of the franchise...,7,28 April 2013,"The Resident Evil franchise is very successful and relevant for a reason, it has a loyal fan-base and the movies are made in a way that avid gamers who play the video game version of the films can see and appreciate that the films were made with them (the players who have made the game popular) in mind. If you are not one of the people described in the previous sentence, then it's quite possible that you will have qualms with project Alice and the RE saga. I am a fan of both the video games and the film series so I did not have any problems with this edition, in fact I loved the idea of them bringing back villains and scorned characters from the previous series of films for Alice to face-off with. Leon S Kennedy has finally been cast but unfortunately he's not who we (fans) were thinking he would be. Sigh.

44,p-stepien,Everything but the kitchen majini,3,10 December 2012,"Straight from the sour success of capturing the freighter Arcadia and the incoming attack by Umbrella Corporation forces, Alice (the undying Mila Jovovich) is torpedoed straight back into ultimate undead warfare. After capture by the Red Queen, Alice finds herself locked down in an underground (or rather under-ice) research facility, which tests outbreak scenarios on cloned populations, despite having almost no safeguards whatsoever, which would allow for the situation control. Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) reappears to switch allegiance to humankind, disabling Alice's prison and sending in Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) to assist with her escape. Meanwhile reinforcements come from above in the shape of Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Button (Kevin Durand) and the ex-basketball star, current special op Luther West (Boris Kodjoe). Together they must break Alice out from this deadly complex...Despite all its faults and dumb-downed premises the Resident Evil franchise has always been - for lack of a better word - entertaining, even captivating. Action sequences performed with flair, whilst the endless charisma of heroine Alice makes for easy and endlessy appealing watching. Essentially the best video game features on offer with an ever-expanding story and universe to get engulfed by. Nonetheless this time Paul W.S. Anderson fails to follow through on the base promise, basically throwing everything at the audience, except for the kitchen majini. In an attempt to out-explode and out-kill previous outings everything is bigger, stronger and more visceral, but lacks similar charisma and deathly charm. Instead of one Executioner Alice now has to face two, while lickers have seemingly grown in size, stature and durability. Anderson basically rehashes almost all that worked in previous parts, mixes in a bit of ""Aliens"" iconography, then fails to build it around anything resembling a script. Whereas the action sequences and fights (apparently now heavily inspired by muay thai) are consistently top grade, the same cannot be said about the cast, who apart from several passing grades, fail to deliver quality, instead churning out leaden and uninterested performances. Much probably owed to the lack of plot, which unlike the previous stories always felt focused on an intriguing ordeal.From my side I also sincerely despise the fact that Red Queen has been converted into a malicious computer AI, whilst her ulterior motives set out in the original were logical, obvious, even if homicidal. That said there is still chance to sensibly disclose the logic behind Red Queen's current actions, but this episode in the realm of Resident Evil severely limited faith in Anderson and his overall outlook.",Resident Evil - Retribution
45,moviexclusive,"Loud, dumb and pointless – if even the action fails to thrill, then you know this franchise is well past its 'Afterlife' and close to the point of 'Extinction'",4,12 September 2012,"Unless you're a die-hard fan of the video game, you're unlikely to recall much of the details or for that matter, the fate of the various supporting characters in the previous four instalments of the undying 'Resident Evil' franchise. Nonetheless, a significant part of how much you'll enjoy 'Retribution' depends on your memory of key ones like Jill Valentine from 'Apocalypse', Albert Wesker from 'Apocalypse' and 'Extinction', and Rain Ocampo from the very first 'Resident Evil' – a tall order, in our opinion, from anchor writer/director Paul W.S. Anderson considering how unremarkable and repetitive most of the instalments were.The reunion of these beloved video game characters should portent well for this fifth movie, but unfortunately the joy of their reappearance is short-lived. On one hand, Anderson doesn't bother to help neophytes understand their history with Alice and the Umbrella Corporation; on the other, his film is just too dreadful to give any of these characters the welcoming party they deserve. Yes, if you were disappointed with 'Afterlife', be prepared to relive that same dejection with 'Retribution' - which like the former is a loud, dumb and ultimately pointless exercise.Picking right up after the events of the last film, Alice is once again recaptured by the Umbrella Corporation after her escape to Arcadia, a cargo tanker that was meant to be a last safe haven for what was left of the humans. Brought to an large underground secret facility where each cavernous section is made to resemble one f the major cities of New York, Moscow and Tokyo, Alice finds an ally in Ada Wong (China actress Li Bingbing in her Hollywood debut), a survivor captured by Jill – and by the way, Jill is now an Umbrella agent after being brainwashed using a mind-control device attached at her chest. The plot of any of the Anderson-scripted 'Resident Evil' movies tend to be simple to the point of being simplistic – an apt reflection in fact of the measure of his scriptwriting abilities really – and 'Retribution' is no different. Here, Alice and Ada are teamed with five rogue members of the resistance led by Leon (Johann Urb), who infiltrate the facility with the intention of detonating it from within. Evade the Red Queen's (oh yes, she makes a return as the ultimate villain here) armies, rendezvous at the place called the 'submarine pens' and get to the surface before the bombs go off – that's about as complicated as the story goes.Of course, the point of these 'Resident Evil' movies was never story or perhaps even character – but one will be hard pressed to find the action sequences redeeming too, and that is regardless of whether you have been a fan of Anderson's slo-mo stylistics. Yes the slo-mo accompanied with rock music shots are still here (and if it's any consolation, toned down a little from 'Afterlife's' excess); what however disappoints is the tempo and the choreography, which going by how lacklustre both are here, seems to suggest Anderson and his team are fast running out of imagination.Indeed, the somewhat innovative camera angles by Glen MacPherson that maximise the third dimension where possible fail to disguise the fact that there is not one single memorable action sequence. Most disappointing are Leon and his team's confrontation with an entire hooded army in Moscow's Red Square (especially considering how the area was shut down for the first time just for shooting), as well as theirs and Alice's subsequent run-in with the huge beast known as Licker – there are no shortage of guns or ammunition in both these sequences all right, but simply pumping both out relentlessly without any measure of restraint or strategy isn't exactly exciting or interesting.The best Anderson manages to achieve is an extended one-on-one showdown between Alice and Jill on one hand, and Leon and a Les Plagas-infested Rain on another – but even in what is supposed to be the highlight of the film, the seen-it-done-that combination of slo-mo weapons, slo-mo bullets, slo-mo dodging and a dash of CG-ed anatomy display fails to raise our pulses as much as we had hoped that it would. And like the instalments that have come before it, this one ends on another cliffhanger with Alice restored and another fight looming – not to mention a shoo-in for what could be the title of the inevitable next film, 'The Last Stand' (not to be confused with Schwarzenegger's next movie).As always too, Milla Jovovich remains one of the few – if not the only – reason to watch the movie. Anderson knows just that, which is why within the first ten minutes, we get to see Alice naked save for two white cloths over her front and back – but the real disservice he does to his real-life wife is trying to build more emotion into her character through a contrived subplot revolving around a motherly bond she develops for a hearing-impaired child Becky (Aryana Engineer). Given how stilted the dialogue is, the less is said in the film the better – and nowhere is this truer than in Li Bingbing's case, coming off stiff and wooden no matter how admirable her effort at enunciating her English lines.If even the action fails, then you can pretty much surmise that there is very little reason to catch this. It is also disappointing considering how unambitious Paul W.S. Anderson continues to be with what is the most successful video game to screen franchise thus far, content to rehash the same formula from his last films again and again. No matter how his name has been synonymous with the 'Resident Evil' films, the only hope of an 'Afterlife' that will save this series from 'Extinction' is really a new writer/ director – only that alone is 'Retribution' enough for the lacklustre films both fans and non-fans of the video game have been made to endure. www.moviexclusive.com",Resident Evil - Retribution
46,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"More of the same, ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is unfortunately a step down after the previous two entries, but thankfully is far from being the worst in the series.",5,2 February 2014,"""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is the fifth entry in Paul W.S. Anderson's loose (and I mean very loose) film adaptations of the video game series. Although at this point, Anderson has implemented his own agenda for the series, and removed it so far from it's origins, I don't really see them as video-game adaptations anymore. But I digress, because the series' unfaithfulness to its source material is another topic altogether. Let's just focus on the film itself.Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, this time awakening in a remote Umbrella research facility following the events of the previous film's finale. She is greeted by her former enemy, Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who has evidently defected from Umbrella's side after realizing that with their current agenda, there will be no end to Umbrella's evil scheming, which will inevitably lead to the extinction of the human race. Together with a clone of Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) from the first film and a young girl (Aryana Engineer) who thinks Alice is her mother, Alice is forced to navigate a series of experimental test grounds in the facility, modeled after major world landmarks, to escape.The acting is pretty much par for the course. There are some good performances and some bad. Jovovich is as charming, sexy and cool as ever in the role of Alice, and this film thankfully forces her to stretch her emotional range a bit more than prior films, due to her relationship with the girl. Roberts is flat as Wesker, though, due to his limited screen time and odd delivery of dialog. Rodriguez is a joy to have back, although her roles (since she portrays multiple versions of herself) aren't well developed. Engineer is a lot of fun as the little girl. Supporting roles from the likes of Johann Urb, Kevin Durand and Sienna Guillory range from decent to poor, unfortunately.I found the writing and direction to be a step down, however. I hold the previous two films (""Extinction"" and ""Afterlife"") in a decent regard, and see them as probably the best the series has to offer- they were tightly written, well-directed and a lot of fun, even though they weren't particularly good films. This movie feels more dead on arrival, though. The script is very rushed, characters are much more under- developed, and it's actually quite bland. It's too much of a paint-by- numbers situation. The direction also isn't quite up to snuff. Even though I found the direction of the prior film distracting, due to its obvious overuse of gimmicky 3D, this film just feels... assembled and without character, and I honestly would have preferred the gimmicky direction of the fourth film, since it at least had style. This just doesn't feel like the work of a filmmaker that is fully invested.The rest of the production also feels as though less effort was put in. Set and costume design ranges from great to awful, and everything feels more generic than ever. The musical score is not memorable in the slightest, nor is it particularly compelling outside of the fantastic opening credits theme. The only real step-up was the visual effects, which were actually very good for the most part. Particularly in the new variation of the ""Licker"", a creature seen in the first two films. While it was never convincing in those movies, here, it's fully realized and looks quite realistic.It's really a shame. Although I was not a particularly big fan of the first two films (in fact, I outright hated the second film), I was very entertained and quite taken by the third and fourth films, due to their fun, action-packed atmosphere. This was definitely a step down, and a step in the wrong direction, and arguably the second weakest film in the franchise. Though thankfully it is nowhere near the disaster that the second film was.I still am curious to see the sixth (and allegedly final) entry in the series, but after this film, I most certainly won't be as excited as I could have been.

48,rivertam26,?,5,13 September 2012,"I've been a long time fan of the Resident Evil series even when people criticized them left and right. I thought they were really entertaining, stylish and inventive. Until now. There is no way I can stick up for this movie or any reason I'd even want to. I can't really give you a synopsis cause I'm not even sure what I just watched. All I can say is that it was huge disappointment in every facet possible. Despite the silliness of the previous films they always grounded themselves in some type of realism within the reigns of its premise. This entry doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same franchise. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. It's a movie based on a video game in which they are actually part of a video game and nothing is really happening. Despite a somewhat promising start with a cool reverse battle sequence, a best of franchise film reel and an inventive and even a little scary trip into suburbia we than move on to the supposed purpose of the film which just doesn't make sense at all. I mean the choices are just astoundingly bad why make the little girl deaf and the film filled with sign language, why set it in this underground facility, why is all of this happening, with this type of technology how does the remaining human population even have a chance, how is Wesker alive and why is he good now? he's not human??? None of these questions will be answered and lets not even discuss the frustratingly awkward scenes like one in which one of the good guys has a double unnecessary death, an uninspired nod towards the Alien franchise and repetitive scenarios that get less effective the more you see them (really the squid face things). Also, the acting has never been good in the Resident Evil series but Milla Jovovich had evoked a cool sense of fierce heroine, this time around she just seems plain bored as do the other actors. Filled with insipid dialogue, questionable plotting,overlong pacing, a weird bad movie from the 90's score, mediocre fight choreography (except for the scene with the chain) and a crapload of wasted potential this movie just feels like a bad dream. Sometimes, when I'm really looking forward to a movie I'll dream about it the night before and it will be horrible well this is what this feels like. Because in no possible way, what I just watched is a resident evil movie. Despite all of my complaining the movie does have some decent scenes the suburbia one I brought up before was kinda neat, another featuring Ada and Alice against 2 ax men and the chain fight in Tokyo. Besides that it's all just a big plodding waste of existential cinematic trash. A brainless, soulless unintentionally funny horror/action/sci fi hybrid that despite a larger budget,returning cast members and more impressive production values feels like an overlong filler episode that leaves me with a big question mark. Why has this happened to my beloved franchise???",Resident Evil - Retribution

Also good final location - the white house, which reminds me of Angel has Fallen movie. Also bit of exhibition, flirting, egoism, emotions. Also good to see old characters. But the story is completely nonsense. No continued, not clear, not interesting, but just random, sudden, twisted. There is nothing to expect in newer sequels except if it gets much different and better than this one.",Resident Evil - Retribution
50,thekarmicnomad,Decidedly less rubbish than the last few.,6,9 March 2013,"The first Resident Evil is one of my all time favourites. Then, unsurprisingly, each film took a step towards utter rubbish. This offering goes back to its Resident roots and plays out a little more like a computer game.Like normal, Alice runs and kicks and runs and shoots and takes a good beating. Zombies, mutants and Lycra clad vileness's are never in short supply. The guys who do the bullet-time effects, who I'm sure are paid by the hour, make a killing from this film.The plot is stupid, the acting and dialogue cheesy. The action predictable and in places monotonous.BUT saying all that they never intended to remake Citizen Kane here. The premise is set out right from the start in plain English: Alice is here, she needs to get over there, kill a million bad guys along the way, set up for next sequel. The film sticks to this premise rigidly, so really it is your own fault if you carry on watching and are disappointed.The setting works well and gives a the director a lot of scope to legitimately empty out his box of CGI toys.The ladies look lovely, the zombies look disgusting and in ninety minutes they get through World War 2's supply of bullets. If this sounds good to you, then happy days!",Resident Evil - Retribution
51,phubbs,Resident Evil: Retribution,6,16 February 2015,"Well I hate to say this but you really do need knowledge of the video game and all previous four films to understand what goes on here. This franchise is one long story and I must say its been handled well with great continuity and an exciting plot, a real hook to the chops that drags you in.The plot continues yet again from the cliff hanger ending of the previous installment, once more invincible Alice is running from the Umbrella Corp and trying to save mankind. Once again she has a new team of allies to get splatted and eaten one by one as, yet again, she escapes another Umbrella facility, this time under the sea.You do get the impression they have run out of ideas for this new film. All the previous films have a memorable setting, almost like levels in a video game believe it or not. The first film was in the Umbrella Hive facility, second film was a suburban setting in Raccoon City, third film was a desert setting and the fourth film was in a prison setting. This new film is just in another Umbrella facility which happens to be under the sea, but that's it, they toss in lots of other testing zones within the facility just to show as many zombie battle locations as possible which seems cheap.I also didn't really like the inclusion of old characters from past films in zombie/clone form. Again this just seemed a little cheap trying to revive past success (sort of success) from the previous films by sticking in the old characters.In my previous reviews I have mentioned that these films have pretty much copied the basic Aliens survival plot with a team of...survivors. Funnily enough this new fifth film actually goes one step further by giving us a Ripley and Newt subplot rip off right down to even copying an alien...errr I mean Licker pinching Alice's little girl and cocooning her! We then get an almost identical dialog sequence with Alice telling West the kid is still alive and she's going after her like it or not. Oh and a mechanical facehugger bit too. Jesus Anderson lets not actually steal scenes now!Speaking of the Licker, this giant one is actually pretty cool, looks down right nasty and bites peoples heads off with spurting blood! nice. The CGI wasn't too bad either, its just in the end its a complete anti climax once invincible Alice finds it.The new team for zombie chow time isn't as good as previous films either. They don't last too long for starters so we don't get to know them, they're just a small team of blokes who are trying too hard to be butch. Leon is crafted well and looks like his video game counterpart but my god does the actor try for the Eastwood thing. The only other guy of interest is Barry who isn't as pretty as Leon but much more guff and gritty but both of course have huge arms, why wouldn't they? The other two guys we find out nothing and don't see much either, where as Alice's new best friend Ada Wong is a nice sexy double act for the chaps. She does everything in a dinner dress too! (doesn't she ever get cold in that?! she's in the Arctic!).This is probably the most video game-like film of the franchise with its internal test zones and duplicated characters all over the shop. It doesn't hold in your memory like the previous films with its bland setting plus there's the usual plot issues like why Wesker wants to now help mankind, I thought he was a super mutant monster thingy and how come the zombies are now almost intelligent to the point where they can hunt underwater! Isn't that kinda checkmate in terms of places left to go? Las Plagas parasite? you see you gotta know the game background somewhat, or so I've read.Of course by now we all know not to look into these things too much with this series. In terms of action, excitement, violence and plot surprisingly, this film does deliver. I must also admit to LOVING that final sequence from the White House, surely most people got a kick outta that enticing visual tease. It looked like a Peter Jackson inspired sequence for the horror genre, my interest levels are rising.6/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
52,fernandoschiavi,"Resident Evil 5: Retribution seeks in a distant past some references to build its plot, but the excess of action tires the audience",5,10 June 2021,"The best feature of the feature film by Paul W. S. Anderson offers are references to games. The narrative is built to look like a game. There are stages - each set in a different country, with different bosses and enemies for each - virtual transitions, new weapons or powers unlocked at each new stage, among other elements taken directly from video games. The whole movie has the look of a Playstation game, from photography, to costumes and characters from the game universe. In addition to Alice and Jill Valentine, join the franchise old acquaintances from the games, who had never shown up in cinema. Ada Wong, Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton are examples of this, gaining space in the films to the delight of fans of the franchise.After so much running and running, it's really hard to get a sense of where our protagonist Alice (Milla Jovovich) really is, but suffice it to say that her quest for revenge against the Umbrella Corporation continues unabated, which here imprisons Alice in a kind of complex that, you see, it simulates experimental realities that are very similar to the game phases that need to be won in popular electronic games. Once again, Alice will have help to escape this challenge, as she will come across (in a clever trick of the script) with the return of some familiar faces of the franchise.Right away, ""Retribution"" shows what it came from: a burst of visual effects. Carrying on the legacy of ""Afterlife"", 3D is widely used. However, it seems that Paul Anderson learned from the exaggerations of the previous film. The strategy of making things ""fly"" in the audience's face is used more modestly and when it is done, it has a less obvious impact than it did in the previous film. Slow motion is also used more intelligently, at times when the effect is needed. The opening scene is unusual and has a very positive effect - it's like we're inside Alice's mind, trying to piece together a recent memory. Not only does the feature film start right where the previous one left off, it explains the entire heroine saga so far. If you haven't watched the other films, you won't be parachuted into history, even if it's not that complex. It is the first clue to Anderson's tendency to relocate in ""extra-film"" everything - contextualization, exposure - that does not refer to the action itself. In one scene, where Jovovich teaches Michelle Rodriguez how to use a gun, she says, ""It's like a camera, you just point and shoot."" This phrase synthesizes Anderson's work - a vision of cinema at once simple and simplistic -, which treats diegetic space as the domain of action and action alone.Perhaps it is thinking about this that Paul W. S. Anderson promotes in this fifth film the return of a figure that was absent since the first feature, the Red Queen artificial intelligence. The sinister computerized little girl (now played by Megan Charpentier) is not only the main element of the ""extra-film"" in Retribution, giving information that situates and moves the plot, but also behaves like the master of the game, triggering scenarios and bosses. -stage every mission from Alice and her friends. The fact that Retribution is set entirely in an Umbrella test facility, from which the heroine needs to flee, obviously gives the film a game face, but it is more in Anderson's direction choices than in the script itself that this kinship is established in fact.Despite the crazy proposal to conduct the story in an underground Umbrella complex used for simulations, the plot actually makes sense. Unexpectedly, the installation's existence, construction and purpose are explained, a rarity in Anderson's scripts so far (with the exception of the first). In the end, the idea of ""global evil"" (which theoretically has been around since RE3: The Extinction) is somewhat exaggerated. Even if we visit Tokyo, Moscow, New York and Raccoon City, the changes of scenery are not so relevant. In the sequences where the characters are in these cities, the location itself doesn't seem to make a difference, since the biggest interaction is not with the environment, but with the creatures. The proof of this is that the sequel in Raccoon City, with the simplest scenario, is one of the most interesting. Meanwhile, in NY the Axemen steal the show and the giant Licker makes you forget you're in Moscow.Once again, the filmmaker explores as much as he can the beauty of his wife, Jovovich, placing her in situations, clothes and poses that evoke only mildly masturbatory images for the male teenage audience (but without showing too much, unfortunately). The promise of a human Alice is definitely fulfilled. Finally, Milla Jovovich showed a more interesting, more empathetic character than the ""killing machine"" of previous films. In ""Afterlife"" Alice was supposed to show her human side after losing her powers, but all that was shown were sequences of impossible feats, not worthy of mere mortals. Yes, Alice from ""Retribution"" is still the badass who kills zombies with impossible stunts and unnecessary explosions, but the fifth feature shows that there is a woman there inside that thick shell. This impression is not restricted to scenes with ""Suburban Alice"", but also with ""Real Alice"" and using a child to bring out the sentimental side of the character was an excellent strategy. What is strange is this human side awakened by Becky not causing any kind of commotion in Alice when she sees her friends who died at Umbrella's hands being used as clones to hunt her down.While there is better development for Alice, again, the secondary characters are completely smothered by her presence, especially when considering Leon and Barry. Requests to bring the character from RE4 to the movies were finally granted, but the script doesn't allow the character to be explored, known and become empathetic. Still talking about game characters, Ada Wong is definitely a standout. Li Bingbing manages to get very close to the spy, despite lacking sensuality. The character is better constructed and explored by the script than Leon and Barry, mainly because of constantly sharing the scene with Alice. However, at a certain point in the film, Ada loses space and prominence - we practically forget that bitch in the red dress is one of Albert Wesker's main agents. While Ada is a surprise, Jill is a disappointment. Sienna comes in as the featured villain, which supposedly makes her an important character in the plot, but what has happened to her since RE2: Apocalypse is unknown. When and how was she captured? Since when is it controlled? Sienna had said in an interview that, like Jill from RE5, she would be aware of her actions while acting against her will. At no point was this shown. Luther could have died in ""Afterlife"", as we came to think, since his participation is insignificant. Chris and Claire are named, but after the battle in Arcadia and the destruction of the Umbrella compound, I'm not sure how Paul Anderson will explain a possible return of the two to the plot.The clones' proposal, which was used as a rather lame justification for bringing Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr and Colin Salmon into the cast, was passed over. Wesker is now, we might say, a former villain. Despite not showing any clear intentions (again, the script fails to explain a relevant point), the character is determined to bring Umbrella down and, as in Umbrella Chronicles, put an end to the Red Queen supercomputer. Now, the girl is a kind of Skynet, who controls Umbrella on all its levels - and hates the human race? This is likely to be the loose end of Alice's journey in the next film.A lot can be said about Resident Evil 5, unless it's a boring movie. The action scenes start right in the opening credits - with a bombastic air raid sequence. It's gunfire, zombies, huge monsters, races and car chases, all at high speed and noise like action fans love so much. With that, any kind of development in relation to the central characters is left aside so that there is more space for the adventure. In other words, don't expect to understand who Alice is or who are her friends. They are just instruments for the action to run as smoothly as possible. Again abandoning zombies for much of the narrative, this new chapter in the Resident Evil saga continues what the previous ones had been doing, increasingly moving away from the undead movie label. Here, the villains are Umbrella and the freaks created by the corporation. Zombies are a small part of the whole. Interestingly, brain-eaters are all the rage lately and it even sounds strange that Resident Evil producers don't take advantage of this good moment to fill the story with zombies.During the entire projection, what the director gives us is sequences and more sequences of brawls à la ""Devil May Cry"" (another Capcom franchise, by the way) that occasionally impress aesthetically, especially due to good 3D photography. But these scenes soon become tiresome and repetitive, not least because the figures we see on screen are extremely two-dimensional, with most serving only to die suddenly or as mere fan service. Well, games can even support unrestrained action because we put ourselves in the characters' shoes, their risk is ours. Here, we have a rather passive experience, with Anderson alternating between unruly slow-motion and abusively fast cuts, like in the final battle in the snow.Despite having a video game look and being a 3D movie series, Resident Evil 5: Retribution seeks in a distant past some references to build its plot: the open endings, which give clear cliffhangers to the sequel, showing how the Earth is after the last events of the War against Umbrella causes chills and fear of what is yet to come, since the sixth part is confirmed, with the release date already set, with what should be the final chapter. The production of Resident Evil is increasingly worn out, carrying a boredom that increases with each new Alice film against the Umbrella corporation.",Resident Evil - Retribution

54,ersinkdotcom,"""Resident Evil: Retribution"" manages to be an action film many will find unbearable to sit through",5,29 December 2012,"I always find it interesting when an action film feels weighted down in tedium. No matter how many things explode on screen or how much people jump around shooting with semi-automatic rifles, it just can't rile up any sense of excitement. These were my thoughts when reflecting on ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" after weathering through an hour and a half of tired action movie clichés, slow motion cinematography, and 3D gimmicks.Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in an underwater Umbrella facility where she must travel through different T-virus testing simulations to escape. Along the way, she meets up with an associate of Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) named Ada (Li Bingbing). She informs her that Wesker is trying to help her escape to join his fight against the Umbrella Corporation and the undead. Wesker also put together a team made up of Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand), and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) to retrieve the two girls.Alice and her rescuers come up against different varieties of the undead as well as a group of familiar faces the Red Queen (Ave Merson-O'Brian) is using to intimidate and fight against them. The team is led by a brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and made up of clones of Alice's dead associates including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez), Carlos (Oded Fehr) and James ""One"" Shade (Colin Salmon). Can Alice get to safety and discover why her old opponent Wesker needs her help so bad?I know the movie is based on a video game, but does ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" have to feel like I'm just watching someone else play it? A script is almost non-existent as the film takes viewers through different simulated ""testing"" grounds for at least an hour of the 95- minute running time. Just like in a video game, you go into a room with a character, defeat whatever monsters are in it, and then move on to the next one and do it all again. If I wanted to play the game, I would have just rented the latest version and skipped this mess.Director / writer Paul W.S. Anderson found a way to shove as many of the old characters from the other movies into this one through his use of clones as assassins and gunners for the Umbrella Corporation. Besides Michelle Rodriguez's Rain, the other returning actors have little to do except shoot guns while running and jumping around on wires.The CGI and visual effects aren't too bad. However, the final sequence of the movie looks like it was pulled straight off of Capcom's game. It looks ridiculously animated and really closes the film on a negative note. There also seems to be some kind of synthetic sheen over any scenes featuring Jovovich that give them an artificial air.""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is a disappointing entry in the franchise. I watched ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" after watching this and it just furthermore pounded home how laborious ""Retribution"" is. Many enthusiasts of these movies may find themselves feeling like they're sitting on a couch with their hands tied behind their backs while being forced to watch a friend play ""Resident Evil 6"" for an hour and a half. It's just not a very pleasant predicament to find yourself in.",Resident Evil - Retribution
55,Darkside-Reviewer,My name is Nostalgia and I remember everything,4,19 July 2019,The fifth movie in the franchise and even the writers have given up on the story and continuity as they fill this movie with every reference possible to the video games but no actual tie in with the games just cheap character substitutes and pointless uninteresting action scenes nothing new here just another cash grab that tied in with the release of the latest game.The movie follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) directly following the events of the previous movie as she has been captured by Umbrella force's that include a brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and is taken to a secret Umbrella facility where Jill Valentine interrogates her but after the facility losses power Alice escapes her holding cell and looks for a way out where she finds old friends have come to break her out and some old dead friends to keep her from leaving.The movie is filled with CGI backgrounds flashy effects and the usual monsters that are just CGI messes and bunch of fake blood the outfits for Alice and Jill are pretty cool but other than that the rest of the characters look like cheap knockoffs of the video game characters no real effort made to make this movie worth while.I recommend watching this movie just the once I got this movie on Blu Ray for 50p online that's how much its worth just a quick action movie to poke fun at for how bad it is not worthy for a collection though,Resident Evil - Retribution
56,anselmdaniel,"Incoherent story, dazzling action",5,31 October 2020,"This review contains spoilers.Resident Evil: Retribution is the sequel to Resident Evil: Afterlife. Resident Evil: Retribution is the fifth movie in the franchise and takes place after Resident Evil: Afterlife. Alice is captured and in a secret Umbrella Corporation laboratory. A team is assembled to rescue Alice in the laboratory.This movie does not fix the poor writing in the previous movies. The movie starts with the attack on the freighter that happens in reverse as an introductory credits scene. The movie then flashes ahead to a clone Alice dealing with a zombie attack in her home. The movie then finally sets up the main arc of the movie with the assembled team infiltrating the arctic base to rescue Alice.In previous movies, the Umbrella Corporation had many baffling events playing into their favor. In this movie, the Umbrella Corporation have a large laboratory in the arctic where they clone city amounts of people to simulate the viruses they have created's effects on a city. This is explained by the Umbrella Corporation selling the viruses to the highest bidder but this only makes sense if the world's countries have not collapsed. By this movie, the world's governments have collapsed and this lab is still in use. People are still being cloned to simulate bio-weapon attacks. This is a central component of the story and it makes no sense.Anybody hoping for a follow-up to characters in the previous movies will not see it here. The characters in the previous movies are ignored to focus on the Alice character. This is not a good choice as Alice was never a developed character. The most character development she got was in the first movie.The action in this movie suffers from the same disadvantages as in Resident Evil: Afterlife. The movie relies too much on 3D where the directing suffers for 2D viewers. The effects in this movie are competently done.This movie does use more characters from the video game series, but they do not resemble their video game counterparts. The movie continues to use their visual style but not their written stories.Resident Evil: Retribution is not recommended. This movie has too many problems to be even entertaining.Grade: D",Resident Evil - Retribution

Aiding Alice in her escape is Ada Wong, an agent who works for Albert Wesker, but hunting them is Jill Valentine, an ex cop whose services has been ""attained"" by the Red Queen. Together they must battle their way past the hordes of mutants, zombies, and the Red Queen to get their freedom.This installment is basically pure action from start to finish but the action that is here is pretty impressive, with quite an interesting opening sequence. Super slow-mo is back as well, but I felt this time it wasn't overused like it was in Afterlife. I generally love slow motion action scenes but only when they're done properly and in moderation (and in the right scenes of course). However, when it gets overused - like in Afterlife - it tends to get a bit boring and mundane, but Retribution isn't too bad with it.Our favourite mutants are back as well. Licker, who's MUCH bigger and more vicious than before; Executioner (Axeman) returns (Resident Evil's version of Pyramid Head from Silent Hill) and I must admit I loved this character; Majini aplenty, as well as the regular zombies.Storywise, well, the story's pretty much non-existent here, a bit like in Afterlife. The story that is here is pretty messy and it actually does get pretty confusing at times as there is a lot of appearing in & out of different city ""scenarios"". Quite easy to get lost if you're not paying attention.One good thing about this installment is that we don't have to put up with the awful acting from Wentworth Miller (who played Chris Redfield in Afterlife). Shawn Roberts is back as Albert Wesker but must have had some acting lessons as he's better in this movie than the last.Resident Evil: Retribution is better than Afterlife, but not by much, and I'm sure the 6th movie - which is in the works - will be about the same.",Resident Evil - Retribution
58,billygoat1071,Swallowing The Gimmicks,4,16 September 2012,"The opening credits looks so promising. Showing us that we are about to see a large action epic. Despite of its ambitious looks, the movie is still stuck with the same problem of the last film. While the film seems to be cool and fun, the adventure refuses to go further than that. It's big and full of action, but most of them are throwbacks from the previous films. Nobody is actually asking for more than seeing Milla Jovovich slaying these zombies, but sometimes we kind of wish to see something new and interesting here. By its intro, Resident Evil: Retribution is ought to be an extraordinary part of the series. Unfortunately, it rather throw stuff at the audience to keep them distracted.The ending of Resident Evil: Afterlife promises that the next installment will be bigger and more explosive than ever. In the ads, it shows that this will be some sort of a warfare adventure. Although it's never a good idea to trust movie trailers, the film becomes disappointing when the plot twists into a smaller and cheaper version of the expected one. Instead of being one of the climatic parts of the series, the film is still stuck at being a sequel that only exists because of its gimmicky use of the modern special effects and the 3D. It hardly has a build up to the story and it has more ""jumping off the screen"" moments than innovations.Other than its gimmickry, the film brought back some characters from the first three, but only for fan service reason. They also brought some iconic characters from the video game like Leon Scott Kennedy and Barry Burton, but sadly their portrayal is pretty bland. The action just got bigger but there is nothing new about it. We've seen the enemies before. The slow-mos are once again repetitive. It's basically meant to be cool, but in the end it's just another gloss. The only good thing here is Milla Jovovich's fighting, tomandandy's music score, and the special effects.Just like Afterlife, Resident Evil: Retribution is another unnecessary part of the series. It's disappointing because this sequel did nothing but to show some random nonsensical set pieces and bring back some old characters. Some new characters were introduced but they turned out to be useless. I understand that it's about the action and the fans swallowing the awesomeness but it's the same thing all over again. It's like combining all the memorable elements from the first four films and made it into a large scale action fare in 3D. Overall, it's mediocre and a cash-in nonsense. In the end of the film, it reveals that the next film will be exaggeratedly bigger than this one. I hope the next one will finally step up as a true apocalyptic onslaught than being a repetitive sequel.",Resident Evil - Retribution
59,dilipbts,Resident evil retribution,7,10 June 2020,"PREMISE: Alice. Kills stuff. PLOT: Alice. Kills stuff.Viewers hoping for a coherent narrative are advised to try Capcom's Resident Evil cartoons; viewers completely new to the series really have no choice but to let the images simply break over them like tsunamis. Despite 2 or 3 pages of exposition, series writer/director Paul W. S. Anderson clearly assumes that anyone rejoining him at this point is so familiar with both the movies and the various R.E./BIOHAZARD VGs that new characters (Ada Wong; Leon Kennedy) can be ported over from the games, and old characters (Rain; Carlos) resurrected without explanation (Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Luther West are back; Claire and Chris Redfield make cameos). Happily, I AM that geekish, so enjoyed the merry-go-round.The CGI FX, which are virtually non-stop, are more varied, energetic, and original than in previous sequels. No more mutant dead dogs, thank goodness, although Anderson remains overly-fond of his tentacles- bursting-out-of-the-mouth shots.The movie is less a script than a series of levels, as Alice, Project Alice, Leon, Ada and their ad hoc teams are dragged through artificial environments adapted from previous installments, from games (notably the new Manhattan and Moscow sets), from any spin-off that isn't bolted to the ground, even from absolutely unconnected franchises (e.g. DAWN OF THE DEAD). Each setting-all controlled by The Red Queen--has its own horde of character clones infected with different strains of the T-Virus and/or Plaga Parasite and its own boss monster adapted from one or another of the games.If...and only if...that paragraph made the least bit of sense, then this movie's recommended.",Resident Evil - Retribution

If the first couple of movies took liberty and replaced our beloved heroes with a poor character without savour, at least they tried to remain close to the source material.

I enjoyed that they brought back a few of the cooler characters from the franchise, but they all felt very hollow, there for show and shock value rather than for any real meaning or contribution to the plot.In terms of the dialogue and acting, Retribution falls below the already relatively low standard set by the rest of the franchise.On the bright side I did enjoy the action in parts. There were a few generic bits that were going through the motions, but mostly it was fun.

It was a wise decision not to take this fifth or is it sixth sequel too seriously, but it was also wise not to make it a comedy on the surface but to play it all with a straight face while things that you might expect from Robert Rodriguez's Planet Terror or Machete occur. This is really an example of so bad it's good. I had a lot of fun watching it. Don't listen to the critics. If you're a Resident Evil fan, you won't be disappointed.",Resident Evil - Retribution
63,lagudafuad,this a movie not worth the time,4,6 October 2012,"The whole Alice thing and new creatures to wipe out with eye pleasing stunts is starting to get very old, not to add boring.This is the fifth installment in this film series and the third to be directed by Paul W. S. Anderson who also wrote the movie. It features various cast from the old movies like Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine), Boris Kodjoe (Luther West) and Michelle Rodriguez who played Rain Ocampo in the first film.Retribution also brings back the red queen from the first resident evil, but her must kill attitude makes you wish someone will just put a sock in it. The thing is if you want to enjoy this movie, live your brains at home, and if you are like some (eg me) who finds it impossible to do so, then strap in for a gun fight, hand to hand combat all for apparently no reason.The high note in this film will be Alice; I never get to have enough of Milla Jovovich's portrayal of the character.The movie's story sees Alice (Milla Jovovich) captured by the Umbrella Corporation. She now has to escape from an underwater base in the Arctic Circle, used for testing the T-virus.Rodriguez and Guillory were very much in par with Jovovich's acting and the fight scene between Guillory (Jill) and Jovovich (Alice) was too long, and it was said to have involved more than 200 moves. Directing is no way near perfection; the sad thing is a sixth movie is also being planned.The slow motion and matrix effects were over used and not necessary in some scenes, other slacks were in editing we had scenes taking too long. Anderson and Jovovich also worked together in the movie The Three Musketeers (2011). If you are planning to go watch this movie, you can but just leave your brain at home",Resident Evil - Retribution
64,willcundallreview,Why are they getting worse?,2,26 November 2015,"It's just like come on every time with this film series, it never ever improves and yet again this movie is a step down from the last outing. We see again a movie full of action, easy to follow yes but fun, my word no, this is awful and that is not a word I have had to previously use on the franchise before. We see this time Alice (Milla Jovovich) fighting yet again, things pick up from where the last film left off, down to the second actually and from then on we see a mass adventure that goes nowhere and only provides glimpses of some decent action choreography that just doesn't mean anything among all the terrible lines spewed out. The man behind this all is Paul W. S. Anderson who is a producer on this film as well as the director and writer, and oh how he screws this one up, a movie I feel just didn't need to be made, or actually, just made well!Jovovich is typical in her role as Alice and for those who have come to get used to her acting it is same old, really though I do feel the writing makes her feel worse as an actor though. This movie is obsessed with throwing things from the past right back at you and none of them work, it feels like Anderson ran out of ideas within the first 5 minutes and just couldn't be bothered to make something even half decent. The plot is full but flimsy, in fact so full it is that by the end it is breaking off and becoming increasingly run of the mill with every passing second. We see some new faces and some we have seen before but truly none of them work, the villains seem like the shoddiest creation of this movie(the story isn't far off though).Anderson just doesn't seem to get it that he's not making good movies, sure you can make a few poor one's and they'll blow over eventually, but this is something else. The series started out under average and was poor too but never was it truly very bad but now it is has reached that and maybe it is the annoyance I have for this series or that it just gets worse every time but, I just had to describe this as awful. Let's talk about the technical points and the CGI is OK at times but even that is used stupidly, the sets are something from a weird dream that is also a nightmare and all the time I just felt what a waste of not only production designers, but also of imagination.I'm not going to rant for nine pages about how I hated this, I'm going to leave it for you to see if you haven't all ready, I know even some like these kind of OTT action movies but this one really does not stand out and can't even rank well among it's not even OK predecessors. I hope one day Anderson can look back on his career and realise this was not a good move, I even hope he can make one film where everyone likes it and says ""Hey great job Paul"" and not ""Remember when you made those dumb zombie movies Paul, they were real bad"". So yes, Resident Evil Retribution, a movie that is hard to recommend unless you're either really into zombies or really into Milla Jovovich, and even then there are many better zombie movies out there, and movies with Jovovich in that are also much better.",Resident Evil - Retribution
65,drpainters,Either these keep getting better or...,8,27 August 2019,"My God this movie is so amazing (in 3d). Just pure action advances the ongoing story slightly. If you're giving this a poor review, why the hell are you watching in the first place. It's the 5th one, if you didn't like the first 4 stop wasting your time you masochistic weirdo. Enjoy the movie, 420 + 3d makes this a guaranteed good time. I would say my 2nd favorite after the first, just because of rehashing different villains from previous installments and pure action with Ludacris 3d.",Resident Evil - Retribution
66,TwistedContent,"A Reflection on the franchise itself - All Action, of course",5,10 February 2021,"In what is not the last, but is likely the least of installments, we see more of the same and no real movement forward. An epic intro, followed, as always, by Alice's story, or the ""previously on Resident Evil"", going into another weakly outlined, shallow story, this time tying in more with the very first movie, bringing back multiple characters, albeit some of them are a little different. In a way, ""Retribution"" is an ode to the franchise itself at that point, and, well, wasn't necessary.We learn that the situation at the end of ""Afterlife"" has led to Alice being captured, and tampered with by none other than Umbrella Corporation, which is now solely controlled by the Red Queen, the AI from the beginnings of the franchise. Similarly to the first part, decent portion of events take place inside one of their huge facilities, though it's not claustrophobic no more - the spacious facility is meant for simulations, so various settings are explored. Anderson has tried to make it all fun with use of various terrains, locations, different infected etc., but, again, all in the name of variety in action and eye candy, not story and, frankly, neither atmosphere. I'm not sure if I have seen zombies riding cars and jumping motorcycles before...
The nature of the system of characters don't change, old and new pals, acting cool, come to rescue. Ada Wong existed for exposition and fights, Leon got entirely disrespected as a character, and so were a few other one-function, one-off guys. Characters of ""Retribution""don't evolve, except to die or partake in paper thin melodrama. Milla continuously shows devotion to the franchise and Alice, having more range this time around, as one plot line deals with her living the ""normal"" life as a suburban mom right when the apocalypse starts. I complimented the miniboss in ""Afterlife"", and they literally pulled the same guy again, this two of them for an action scene. Big scary boys from ""Apocalypse"" also made second appearances. C'mon guys, to have more of exactly the same wasn't my point. The franchise's standard entertainment value and where it's rooted, in flashy, occasionally even reasonably tense, action sequences, is still alive and well, as is the lack of depth. By the third act, the formula has become a little tiresome, and you find yourself slightly relieved when the climax has passed.If you're looking for a for an action packed adventure (with a sense of emptiness), this here is a good contender, dramatic, loud, flashy, pointless. My rating: 5/10.",Resident Evil - Retribution
67,p-jonsson,"Delivers what you would expectaction, action and some more action",7,3 February 2013,"This movie is the 5th installment in the Resident Evil series. Why would you want to watch this movie? Why would you want to watch any Resident Evil movie come to think about? Good actingnope. Intelligent and intriguing plotabsolutely not. Zombiesyep. Actionmost definitely yes! Anything elsewell if you're member of the younger part of the average male population you probably watch it for Milla Jovovich as well.Now that we have established the baseline for the movie, does this movie deliver? The answer to that is, without a doubt, YES! This film delivered exactly what I expected of it. As I mentioned it is the 5th movie in the series and the entire series is sprung from a video game in the first place so it should really be no surprise that the film is one long video game action sequence sporadically interrupted with some dialog. Yet a lot of people seems to expect something else and judges the movie by those expectations.I think those really low rating are quite unfair. The movie does indeed deliver what I think you should expect. A lot of the action scenes are marvelous. The slow motion scenes are well done and enjoyable unlike some movies where they are just annoying. The zombies and other monsters are good. And yes, I confess that, although I'm hardly among the younger part of the male audience anymore I do like watching Milla Jovovich jumping around in the scenes in those ridiculous skin tight suits.If I should complain about anything it would be that I sat through half the movie being annoyed that nobody would get the, painfully obvious, idea to rip that red mind control gizmo off Jill's chest. When it was finally done in the end it was like ""did you really have to take that long to get that idea into your head you dumb bastards"".I cannot really give the movie a top rating since it does lack much of a story after all but I certainly think it is worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed myself a lot while watching it. The ending is the usual video-game-movie cliff-hanger and I really hope they make another sequel now when Alice got her powers back. That she lost those was one of the big downers for me in one of the previous movies in the franchise.",Resident Evil - Retribution
68,akshatmahajan,Different,8,9 November 2020,"I enjoyed this movie. It was different from other parts. The beginning unnecessary rewind scene in which too much VFX was used, was fun to watch.

69,xamtaro,If a bad fan fiction writer got a multi million dollar budget,5,12 October 2012,"Paul WS Anderson takes ""style over substance"" to its limit in his fifth installment in the Resident Evil movie franchise. At least half the action scenes are in slo-mo, similar to the previous franchise entry. What might be more stylish than slo-mo? Slo-mo in reverse! And that is exactly what the opening sequence delivers; it wastes almost 5 whole minutes picking up from the previous film: Umbrella Corporation forces attack the ship that Alice and her friends are on, there is lots of shooting then Alice is blown into the water. All that IN REVERSE, then forward again. Alice is captured and trapped in a vast underwater facility that houses replicas of the world's major cities like New York and Moscow. It is revealed that Albert Wesker (the main villain so far) has splintered off from Umbrella corporation (which is now being run by the artificial intelligence program ""Red Queen""). Alice must escape, but not before fighting her way from one movie cliché to another.For those new to the Resident Evil movie franchise, it is everything you'd expect from a skewed piece of fan fiction. Paul WS Anderson's wife, Milla Jovovich, stars as the ultimate Mary Sue character named Alice; effectively reducing main characters from the Resident Evil video games to supporting roles. Stripped of her superpowers, Alice is still unnaturally agile, sickeningly strong and uncannily durable. Bullets magically miss her, convenient tools and weapons appear to her when she needs them and her guns never run out of ammo. If all the slow motion scenes were played at normal speed, this already short movie will be a lot shorter. Its actual narrative is already THAT thin, not to mention that most of it is a pastiche of scenes and concepts ripped off from other films. James Cameron's Aliens, Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead and many others are blatantly and shamelessly plagiarized. In what I suppose is meant to be a ""smart"" reference of a reference, Paul WS Anderson rips off the ""X-Ray vision bone crunching"" fighting gimmick that was used in 2009's Mortal Kombat video game (not surprisingly, Anderson directed the very first Mortal Kombat movie).Within the zombiefied narrative, we are treated to more ""startling"" revelations that only serve to muddle up the already messy story of the Resident evil movie franchise. New creatures pop out of nowhere without any conceivable explanation, a new zombie infection called ""las plagas"" is introduced, and we get unsurprising origin of Alice and who she truly is. Speaking of zombies, they feature very rarely in this movie; or at least the traditional human zombies that Resident Evil is known for. Giant Mutant creatures only make occasional appearances as ""mini-bosses"" for Awesome Alice to kill (as usual). Most of the fighting involves Alice, former Umbrella operative Ada Wong and a mercenary team led by Leon Kennedy going up against cloned Umbrella troopers including a few familiar faces.Yes the special effects are top notch (considering its huge budget), and the slow motion will keep ramming that fact into your face. But other than that, there is little else to enjoy about this movie (perhaps some will get off on a near nude Milla Jovovich's torture scene). There is no sense of peril for the characters and even the fight choreography is more like dancing than fighting.With a story that feels like a filler episode in a TV series, shallow characters, blatant plagiarism and a overall ""been there done that"" feel, Resident Evil Retribution shows a zombie movie franchise in the literal sense; the same thing that just keeps coming back from the grave, more mutated than ever. What we have, at best, is a multi million dollar tech demo for fight choreography, slo mo cinematography and 3D.",Resident Evil - Retribution
70,cat_ranchero,Entertaining?...,6,1 June 2013,"Very heavy on the CGI, which is all very well done by the way, I'm guessing a lot of green paint was used. I think just about every fight sequence was shot in slow motion; I'm not sure why but for me it didn't add any excitement. Nobody will win any prizes for the performances, although I thought Michelle Rodriguez as Rain did a pretty good job. Okay, from an entertainment perspective, yes, it did its job; an easy to follow plot that has plenty of action and some very pretty ladies; this red blooded male was not disappointed on that front. On the down side; it does look like you're watching someone else playing a first person shooter video game. It's left wide open for another sequel (hopefully the last one), so I guess there will be more And I will be watching.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Purely for entertainment If this is your sort of thing that is)My score: 5.7/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Resident Evil - Retribution

72,jayjaycee,"Same mistakes, same pointlessness, same typical Anderson film",3,15 April 2020,"""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is a 2012 action horror film written and directed by Paul W.S. Anderson starring Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory. After the disasterpiece the previous installment has been, the series even more moves on as an action flick rather than horror film and loses even the smallest rest of a soul it had. You already know my profound aversion towards the probably worst director working Hollywood, Paul W.S. Anderson and if I went deeper into how much I dislike him, my reviews would become sort of repetitive. Speaking of repetitive, this film here is once again on the same abysmally low level of quality. If there's nothing new to add and the film suffers from the exact same flaws over and over again, how am I supposed to not repeat myself? Sigh. As usual, the film wastes most of its runtime with absolutely useless nonsense and pointless scenes. Not only does it have a completely questionable slow motion intro scene, it also features a totally needless recap sequence that takes around ten minutes of a ninety minutes feature film. You know where this is going? From there on, I knew that I was in for some extremely boring garbage. Again. What comes then is not slightly better. This man will always remain a mystery to me, it's strangely fascinating. How can you film scenes that are lasting so painfully long while they're having absolutely nothing to say? There's happening so much and yet so little. It's clearly something happening, but not interested enough or coherently explained why. Or what. Fact is, Anderson has the dolorous ability to write and film sequences without any meaning behind it. Strangely, those sequences last for a whole film when he's in charge of the whole creative process. In addition to that, he once more proved that he can connect the previous film in the sloppiest way possible. He tries to create a certain continuity and fails miserably, all the while losing some actually important characters. Somehow and not further mentioned, the Redfields have disappeared without a trace. Gone with the winds. Simply vanished. Isn't that proof enough that this man is obviously not capable of making a great film? How often do I have to point this out? Sigh. You think the beginning is already the worst? Sorry to disappoint you, but it's all downhill from there. Aside from the evident predilection for filming his wife in full nudity over and over again, he also has not the simplest form of an understanding of enacting decent action sequences. Basically, I love some action films and it's not impossible to have exciting choreographies (the ""John Wick"" series, for instance), but what is shown here is just laziness in its purest form. Come on, all the so-called action sequences are literally just monotonous gunfire without any interesting movements or any form of choreography. The choreography is that there's none. The abstruse ""plot"" that results from an mediocre yet actually promising premise is not much better. It's again evident how Anderson tries to desperately keep up the connection with the games, although that train has left the station long ago. How it does it? Well, his general measure is to bring in beloved characters from the games, make them totally irrelevant and to not give him the slightest touch of spotlight. I'm obviously talking about the legendary Leon S. Kennedy who like Jill was degraded to an underused side character and looks like some random dude in his cosplay costume. The same applies to Ada Wong and Barry Burton. Disgracing the source material so severely just to still call it Resident Evil. You still call yourself a fan, Paul? You don't seem to be at all. What the film offers from there on is again nothing short of sleep inducing trash no-one ever asked for. One repetitive shootout follows another and along the way it features utterly stupid character choices and plot decisions. Why did they bring back characters from the other films as clones? Why did Alice all suddenly care so much about that little girl that's nothing but an artificially created clone she has zero connection to? Why did she leave behind her saviours in order to save her? Even worse: Why is Wesker all suddenly a renegade agent and how is the Red Queen still alive? Those unnecessary and unexplainable features are the true horror of this film. Oh, and the final fight is just a disgrace to the characters, ludicrous and dolorously unrealistic. On top of that, they even throw mud at the Las Plagas and ... it even turns into Mortal Kombat? Don't ask me why, but ... somehow? Oh, and the ending definitely doesn't mean anything good. That's for sure. All in all, this entry is repetitive, dull, boring, meaningless, pointless and hasn't learned from any of its mistakes. While the previous one was some sort of guilty pleasure this one again falls under the category of ""simply unentertaining"" and it's another evidence of Paul W.S. Anderson's inability to do anything correctly. It's the definition of stupidity and nothing short of totally forgettable action garbage. Painfully dreadful.",Resident Evil - Retribution

1. Why she would talk or work with Wesker makes zero sense. The second they think he exploded and they're safe they're bombarded by an aerial Armada and she wakes as a prisoner again!2. I honestly don't know why they want to kill her or shut her up.3. I sense ethical dilemmas that have zero to do with the story surrounding cloning and AI or real intelligence that gets irritating with an irrelevant attachment to the cloned little girl who's cloned Mother (Alice' clone) got killed by back to regular zombies.4.

While none of them are Oscar contenders, generally it is good for 2 hours of action adventure, millions of rounds of bad shooting, zombies and generally watchable.Oh wow. Whether you are a fan, semi-fan, or even a hater, this movie is such a step down from any of the previous four.Mistake #1 Everything was done in one warehouse, one cul-de-sac of houses, and a whole bunch of computers. I doubt very seriously if Milla Jovovich even had to leave the same room for 85% of the movie. I would not surprised me if all her scenes were done in a couple days, and the computers did the rest. There was no need for costume designers, stunt people, stunt cars, or even makeup people, everything was CGI, including the bruises on the face.Mistake #2 The guys that essentially did all the CGI, also wrote the dialogue. The conversations are on par with the dialogue in a bad porn movie. You will have a hard time finding a conversation involving more than 20 words...total...for both people.In short, this is the world's best movie done with Photoshop, or you could say it would be the winning entry of a movie composed by film students(first year community college students).

However, if you're like me and you want your movie to have plots that actually make sense and have a nice flow to them, you probably won't enjoy this movie. It's really upsetting that a franchise that started so well has disintegrated into this. The first two films, I thought were outstanding but the next two were plagued with absurd levels of ridiculousness and this film had the worst plot development I've seen yet. It's unfortunate too because the acting is good enough and the action sequences are entertaining but the cheesy 3D elements and the garbage plot development show just how a terrible director can destroy a movie.

Like the zombies themselves, the film series based on the popular video game series refuses to die thanks to the ever persistent director Paul W.S. Anderson. While they're certainly no masterpieces, I must admit that I do enjoy watching these movies and they just get crazier every time. Right now, this is by far the craziest of them all! The story is fairly simple: Alice and friends continue to battle their way through hordes of T-virus zombies, terrifying mutants, and the ruthless Umbrella Corporation. This time, however, old faces return to haunt our heroine and make things a little more difficult. Luckily, there are some new faces to help her out in an all-out fire fight. There's plenty to like here. First of all, the action scenes are just awesome with a never-ending line of insane twists coming around here and there. The effects are definitely better this time around to the finest detail and the fear-factor is adequate for those of you who like being scared. Seeing some of the familiar faces from the older films like Michelle Rodriguez was a real treat to watch and the new cast holds up pretty well. The music is also a real pleasure to listen to throughout the film.While the Resident Evil film series is starting to get tiresome with each new sequel, this is overall a fun movie to watch.

Based off the ever popular video game series these movies started out as a super power in the syfy/action saga.

The first three films in the series were great success's and did superb at the box office, as I'm sure the rest will and have as well. However, the series has gotten off track and the last two films have been terrible in acting and the CGI is an abomination.

80,rgblakey,Resident Evil delivers action but little else,3,16 September 2012,"Unlike most of the video game based films, the Resident Evil franchise has managed to keep churning them out. While not all are on par with the fun of the original, they each have had something of their own to bring to the table and the fans that enjoy them really get sucked in. The latest installment Resident Evil: Retribution, sported a trailer that seemed to tease the return of previous characters in the series, but does it have anything new to add to the series? Resident Evil: Retribution follows Alice alongside a resistance movement in her continuing war against the Umbrella Corporation. The latest installment is decent enough, but falls short in a lot of ways becoming the weakest of the series so far. There is a lot to digest here in such a short run time and not all of it works or makes sense. As with most of the films there are a lot of holes in the story, but you let a lot of that go in exchange for the zombie killing action. Here you get tons of action, but still just didn't really have the same vibe as the other films. Jovovich steps into the role delivering the character pretty much exactly the same way she always does, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the cast. Most of them are pretty stiff and feel forced or like they just aren't feeling it. There are plenty of returning creatures and characters, but most of them just didn't feel necessary other than to try and add that missing something. The problem is they don't really do much with most of them and they feel like a wasted opportunity. The location of the film is both good and bad. There were some great opportunities here to do some really cool things with their environment all over the world, but instead it just felt like they really served no point other than to attempt to explain how the T-Virus spread. Yes this info is important, but it could have just been in dialogue without the other aspects, and in some ways it pretty much was which was an overall waste of space. The action was really well done for the most part and there was plenty of it. Easily most of the movie was just gun fights and hand to hand combat which keeps you entertained while suffering through the other nonsense.Originally it was said that the fifth and sixth film would be filmed back to back and it shows here. This isn't a horrible film, just feels more like filler to something else instead of the standalone films with an obvious more to come ending like the others. If you are a fan of the series be sure to check this out, because it defiantly sets it up for another and if done correctly could be a great cap on a fun franchise.http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",Resident Evil - Retribution
81,Ziya90,"I saw improvements, the second best in the series",6,15 September 2012,"Well, what I saw in this movie is that it seems our director Paul W.S. Anderson took lessons from the mistakes he did in the previous sequels, so made some improvements. What are those? Firstly after the first film, the focus was shifted from zombie battle to some other sub stories and that caused the story to scatter, in other words lost its focus. In Retribution, we come back to the ""zombie"" horror which is good. The movie has some good zombie action. The first movie was subtle, solid and stylish, then in the sequels, As for the style, it turned into almost garbage. In this installment, Anderson brings some ""art"". Remember the suburbia scenes which also reminded me Kill Bill. The movie is not subtle may be like the first one, but at least it is stylish and not superficial like Afterlife. Thus, Retribution is not entertainment without ""cinema"" Yes there are such movies believe me! You may find the story cliché, you may find the movie shallow, you may find the movie average etc. but at least it is not an ""empty"" movie. Thirdly, Anderson got rid of ""Matrix trend"" which is good too. This movie has his own action style. Afterlife was lack of real violence and horror, in this one, you will get these! Except for the first movie, especially the second and the fourth one was pretty boring at times because of lack of action. Retribution is almost non stop action! And it is better action. I always hated that all the sequels had a very ugly monster mostly as the climax, this installment has a different (and better) climax! In Apocalypse and Afterlife, there were some ridiculous moments, this movie avoids that and catches a serious tone. And if you liked the giant hatchet scene from the previous movie, the extended version is here, it was a great scene and this time it was not pointless (Sucker Punch logic, good) Michelle Rodriguez, the problem was her character isn't a well written character, so don't expect ""Avatar level"" However, to see her was real good. As for 3D, it was worthy, but worse than Afterlife and Three Musketeers. I don't know why. In the second half, the movie has some very cliché moments, but not a big deal. And yes, at times, the movie repeats itself, may be it doesn't add anything new, but I've gotten used to that. It has a better direction, better visuals and even a better, more solid script without any ridiculousness and that's enough for me. As said it is better than all of the sequels and it is like almost a masterpiece in comparison with the recent Underworld Awakening. If Anderson plans to make a sixth movie, I hope he can surpass this one, We have enough disappointments.",Resident Evil - Retribution
82,dormesher-21565,Weakest of the series but still very fun...... Resident Evil Retribution,7,15 November 2018,"Resident Evil Retribution the fifth entry in the Resident Evil movie franchise and the weakest in my opinion.
However it's still a very fun and enjoyable entry in to the series with some awesome action and an interesting plot with Alice trying to get out of the Umbrella Prime facility which creates VR world's very interesting and pretty well handled.There some some things that bother about this one which is the reason it's the weakest of the films in my opinion and why I like the other movies better.
This entry just feels like filler to get to The Final Chapter non of the other movies did that and followed on very nicely but could stand alone this one just feels like it's setting up things to come and that's pretty annoying in my opinion.We do get some characters from the game's introduced which is awesome like Leon Kennedy who is handled really well. We also get Ada Wong who I wasn't a massive fan of in the games but she's pretty cool in the films.
Jill Valentine is also back and her story is pretty cool her being controlled by Umbrella was pretty awesome. And her action scenes where bad ass.They do bring back other characters back from previous movies but they are waisted in this movie Rain played by Michelle Rodriguez serves no purpose in this movie and is only in this to remind us of what's happened in previous movies and to be a complication for Alice.However I do really enjoy this movie the story is very interesting and very cool with some great action sequences and Alice is still the interesting character that we all know. And I really like this character she is a great lead character in my opinion.Just a fun movie that i enjoy but I enjoy the other entries in the franchise more. Very fun action and an interesting storyline in a great sequel that leaves you wanting more by the end of the film. I can't wait to see how it ends after this movie.Verdict 7.3/10 very fun and action packed had some flaws and i enjoy the other films more but this is a great entry into this awesome franchise.",Resident Evil - Retribution
83,blrnani,Video game lacking any audience appeal,4,5 February 2018,"From the opening credits, which show the immediate continuation of the previous film (but in reverse) onwards this feels like watching a videogame that some other unknown person (or perhaps a machine) is playing. Consequently it feels entirely contrived and there is no viewer involvement at any level, as it lacks both the structure and character development of a film story or the participatory element of a videogame one is playing oneself. It has got to the point where there are so many manufactured and or rebooted versions of the Alice figure and other participants that the entire series has lost any meaningful connection for the audience, despite the director's attempt to persuade us otherwise, as the multi-rebooted Alice decides to protect a child who was manufactured for the role of daughter to a manufactured suburban version of her. Basically, with all this cloning, anybody can be destroyed and brought back to serve a plotline that is becoming increasingly absurd. And we all know that clones aren't the real thing, but likely to be programmed by Umbrella, or the Red Queen, or Wesker, to serve some nefarious purpose that I have lost interest in knowing about.",Resident Evil - Retribution
84,DustinRahksi,The best movie of the year.,2,4 January 2013,"More like the worst movie i've seen all year. Where do I even begin with a stinker like this. I can't believe garbage like this can make 200 million dollars. This film feels like it was slapped together in a couple of months, not even. I didn't think they could make a worse one than afterlife, well it's not that bad, but it still numbs my brain.Let's start with the characters. You would think film has reached an all time low with these actors. This was a fairly big budget film, couldn't they have got better people. The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen, they should feel embarrassed, it is simply atrocious. Did I mention these characters are super-human and can deflect bullets. Take this for example, 6 guys versus 500 umbrella soldiers armed to the teeth, and they lose one guy, to a chainsaw man no less. Or how their car gets shot a couple hundred times, even point blank through the window, they still remain untouched. These have to be the worst actors i've seen in a long time. If you want wooden characters that sound like they are simply reading their lines out loud, look no further. This film came out in 2012, but the cgi looked horrendous, absolutely abysmal. I have to say Jill Valentine is bad ass, she beats the crap out of Alice. Oh, I should also mention Los plagues Rodrigez breaks just about every bone in Leon and that other guy's body, and they act like nothing happened. I mean come on, we see and hear their bones break, get real. Alice also manages to bleed out for an hour and a half straight, without dying. I could go on for another paragraph or two about this movies flaw's, but that would be too much. One more thing, there is an intolerable amount of slow-motion in this film, you know because the movie is so cool we have to see everything in slow-motion, just in case we missed it. And why is Wesker a good guy now? And lastly, what happened to the Redfields? Did they just forget about them or what.This movie is so bad, you will find yourself laughing at how bad it is. If you are willing to stomp reality in the face and let your brain turn to mush, I dare you to watch this film, but please don't spend thirty dollars on it, you'll hate yourself if you do. I say stay away if you want to keep your brain cells, but watch it if you want a good laugh, there are many to be had.!update! I've just noticed that two Re fans came in here and disliked all the negative reviews, some people can't understand the facts and have to cry about it. Well they can enjoy their crappy movie, but I sure won't, thats for darn sure.",Resident Evil - Retribution
85,RogerBorg,More brain dead than a decapitated zombie,3,10 November 2020,"I have a theory about Retribution: Writer/director Paul Anderson lost a bet with Uwe Boll and had to make something that combined the absolute worst parts from the entire Resident Evil series of gamesVoice acting as bad as the original. Guns that never, ever need reloading, until the character's plot armour fails. Plot lines that get sold up then go nowhere (Alice's bullet wound). Invisible inventory slots - where exactly was Ada Wong carrying that grapple gun? Intelligent, tool using, team working zombies - the very thing that Umbrella was seeking and failing to create in Extinction.Nothing in it makes a damn bit of sense. How did Alice get from the Arcadia to the facility? What did the Red Queen need her for anyway? What's Jill Valentine being doing since Apocalypse, why has she gone blonde, and when did she get Goddamn superpowers just like everybody else seems to have developed?The movie just expects you to suspend your disbelief, hold all questions to the end (and then forget about them), and just watch some sub-Matrix extended slo-mo fight scenes over and over and over again.All of it I could forgive if at the entire point of the Afterlife / Retribution arc wasn't that Alice was supposed to be de-powered. Well, you could have fooled me. Here she is, flipping and fighting and neck snapping and tearing up armies of zombies and soldiers exactly as before. Anderson the director seemed to have no idea what Anderson the writer was doing.The plus side is that are some great visuals here and Jovovich is as compelling as ever. But that's it. That's the entire draw of the film. There's simply nothing else here to like, and it's so insultingly mindless that I couldn't kick back and enjoy the spectacle.",Resident Evil - Retribution
86,dmuel,a piece of cr*p,1,13 October 2012,"Now, let's remember that Resident Evil, like a number of other movies, was originally a video game. While never having created a deep and ponderous story-line, a few of the episodes in this series, (let's see now...this is number 5 I think), managed to produce some intriguing action sequences as well as generate interest in the characters. OK, maybe not that much interest, but the flicks weren't too bad as far as these kinds of kill-the-zombies movies go. Our heroine, clad in skin tight black leather suits, always managed a certain charisma, or something like charisma anyway. Needless to say, the series managed sufficient fan support to go all the way to number 5. The Matrix didn't even get to number 4. But in this episode, the entire movie is as about as interesting as watching your dumb kid brother spend an hour and thirty minutes on his video game blasting the zombies on the screen. Maybe watching your kid brother would be more interesting. Maybe the first 30 minutes of the movie really is footage of someone's kid brother blasting zombies in his video game. It might be hard to tell the difference. And, it's all downhill from there. Don't waste your time, even if you are a fan of the series. You will be disappointed.",Resident Evil - Retribution
87,tequila101,My least favorite of the Series,5,6 April 2013,"I was quite intrigued by the Resident Evil series last year and I was that pumped for them, that I watched the first 4 within one single period. I was so glad to hear that they were making a 5th one, I was dying to see how this next entry would expose more of the series, more mindless zombie action and how they would make more tribute to the games.My first impression of the trailer back in September was that it looked like it could be of some decent promise. I had a feeling the film could still be better than watching the trailer itself.I then see the film, and here's what I thought of it in a few words: confusing, mind-numbing, sometimes out of context and even unethical to plot lines.That's what I mainly though about this film. This 5th installment had so much promise, but instead decided to take things to extreme heights and go in some of the most confusing, most mind-numbing scenes and story lines I have ever seen in a Resident Evil film. Sure, the Resident Evil films partly have twists in their stories over time and all the time, but this one took the bait. It made me as a viewer really confused about where they were taking the story, characters, action and the entire premise of the elements and meaning. Did I mention I was already a tad confused??? I don't expect there to be well-developed things happening in a Resident Evil film, but I do expect there to be some form of entertainment, to say the least. The beginning and most of the first hour is nothing but flashes for what I could see of the 1st and 2nd film, and then there were many different plots happening and jamming in at the same time which made me lost on what was happening.I also found that there were hardly any zombies in this thing. Where were the zombies in this film! They are the prime source to what made this series. I see them and I saw chaos occurring everywhere in the first four films which actually do a good job at creating some form of tension and action. Here there is none of that. And why is it that the character of Leon, who is in the 4th and 6th game installments suddenly thrown into this??? I'll never understand that.In my opinion, I believe they should have just continued the battle on the boat and went from there. It would have created more realism and stay true to the series. This film feels like a differently, filmed entry on it's own.On a positive note, I would say the action sequences and soundtrack score were excellent as always. They were the only elements that kept this film at it's feet (barely).Overall I don't hate this film, but I certainly was disappointed by it. I mean what were the creators thinking when they were throwing scenes around in this film??? And hardly any zombies??? I'd say stick with the first 4, yes even Afterlife. If you think Afterlife is bad (which I really liked a heap), try this and compare them. 5/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
88,CMTiago,"More boom boom, less blah blah",4,13 August 2014,"This is basically how I would summarize the fifth installment of the decadent Resident Evil franchise. This is a series of movies that I have yet to fully watch, but at times it seems frustrating to watch good source material poorly used. From some parts that I saw from the original,I think that might be the best. After that I've also seen a bit of Apocalypse, all of Extinction, and have yet to see Afterlife. So far the things I liked about these movies are some of the action, Milla Joviovich in general and for the better part Extinction (Saw it when I was younger). As far as Retribution goes, one shouldn't expect any more than what we get as a standard in Hollywood: All boom boom, no blah blah. On a side note, the ending kind of had me a bit interested, but had this franchise had any sort of impact on me in the last few years, and I would have been pumped. The only reason I don't give this one is because of Milla's physique (Sue me, I'm male) and a generally good set up for the upcoming final movie in the saga.Rating: 3/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
89,vip-danii,"Please Stop Making ""Resident Evil"" Movies... You Have Killed The Franchise Long Ago. Please, No More!",1,18 March 2013,"Yes, after ""Apocalypse"", it's all been downhill. But this... And I thought that cheesy piece of crap with Ashanti was lame... well, this one gives the term ""lame"" a whole new meaning. It's downright unwatchable! Yes, MUCH worse than the previous one! You can summarize this in 3 words: lame, confusing, annoying.The whole ""plot"" (if you can call it that) is as follows: Alice is fighting her way out of an underground Umbrella laboratory with simulated environment -- one minute it's New York, then Hon-Kong, then Siberia, etc. She is being chased by simulated characters that, even though they're not real people (but holograms or something), they still use real ammunition (that never runs out) and are able to hurt a human being.Action is all there is to this movie. Unrealistic, badly-executed, senseless, cheesy, annoyingly predictable excuse for action, that is. No plot whatsoever. In-between, there are some flashbacks (or whatever they're supposed to be) of Alice leading a normal life -- this doesn't fit anywhere into the movie and only confuses the viewer. Then she's (or her clones... it's unclear) running/fighting again, and it goes on and on in a predictably monotonous fashion for the whole duration of the movie. The only redeeming factor, is that we get to see some familiar faces. Rain, Carlos, Jill. But as soon as these characters are introduced, you begin to wish they weren't. One minute they're Alice's friends, the next - they're trying to kill her.Then there's this ANNOYING thing with millions of Alice clones running around (or, in this case, also hanging on clothes hangers or something!). I can't stand that! I hate it when there's more than one Alice! It's a ridiculous concept, and I was hoping that they'd not make the same mistake again, as it was apparent that people hated it, but... that s*** is still happening in this movie, which makes an already unwatchable movie, 10 times worse.You CANNOT understand what's going on at any given point in the movie, and you don't even have any desire to, because this movie is just CRAP from the minute it starts.I fail to understand why anyone would rate this piece of crap higher than 3 stars. This film makes VERY little sense (and I have seen ALL of the Resident Evil movies so far), so, if you watch this movie without having seen any prequels, you're going to think that whoever decided to put this movie out, needs urgent medical attention. Yes, it's THAT bad.This movie is an annoying, stupid, confusing, cheesy, incoherent MESS! I was not disappointed; I was INSULTED!",Resident Evil - Retribution
90,jaxbubba,Truly Disappointing; one step above direct-t- video,3,31 October 2012,"I have to admit that I actually enjoy the Resident Evil movies. Despite the mediocre critic reviews, I'm always eager to see the next installments of this highly successful video ...game-to-movie franchise. However I have to admit that in this go-around, even I had a really hard time digesting the nonsense being dished out in this iteration of the series. RE5 fails beyond believe. The storyline is utterly crap. The action are cheesy, the actors are cheesy, the whole movie is a joke to the RE series. I am completely disappointed at how the whole movie turned out. In a nutshell, the film is just a long sequence of fluff and filler whose only goal is to manipulate the audience though a series of scenarios (much like a VIDEO GAME) to get to the next ""LEVEL"" of the game, or in this case the next movie in production, ""Resident Evil 6 – Milking the Audience for DOLLARS!!!""I can't really give you a synopsis of the film, because I'm not even sure what I just watched. All I can say is that it was huge disappointment in every facet possible. Despite the silliness of the previous films they always grounded themselves in some type of realism within the reigns of its remise. This entry doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same franchise. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. It's a movie based on a video game in which they are actually part of a video game and nothing is really happening.In spite of a somewhat promising start with a cool reverse battle sequence, a ""best of franchise"" film reel and an inventive and even a little scary trip into suburbia we then move on to the supposed purpose of the film which just doesn't make sense at all. Alice awakes in a high-tech prison cell as a captive of the Umbrella Corporation from the previous films, and it's not long before her buddies come to break her out, characters such as Leon S Kennedy (Urb), Ada Wong (Li) and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) numbering among them. Alice discovers her former ally Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) has been mind-controlled by the Umbrella Corp to turn against her, and unravels a conspiracy involving simulated arenas and mass cloning as she fights to preserve whatever's left of the human race.The plot and story were very thin. I had a hard time figuring out what exactly was going on in the story. There were no stakes, no subplot. To sum up the entire movie, Alice gets captures by the Umbrella Corporation and Albert Wesker, decides to send a team in to rescue her even though he's been trying to kill her for the past three movies. In the end, Wesker has now become president; and he's in the process of leading the rest of the US Army on a full-scale final assault against the red queen. In addition, Alice gets ""re-enhanced"" and has a decision to make weather to stay and stand against the forces of evil or move on. I must say, it is an interesting premise for the next movie in the series (RE 6) even though I feel truly swindled for having to sit through this installment.I cannot recommend seeing this film; it's truly an abomination to the Resident Evil franchise (though highly profitable, with $217 million in the till worldwide to date). RE 4 and RE 5 have made close $500 Million worldwide, and CapCom has already ""green-lighted"" production for RE 6 and RE 7. So love them or hate them, the Resident Evil motion pictures will be around for some time to come. And even though, I really disliked this film (and I really really DID) it's sad to say, that I AM kind of excited about seeing Resident Evil 6. So call me a SUCKER!!!!!

91,quinnox-1,Stylish and interesting entry,7,18 September 2012,"This film is a departure from the other movies in the series in terms of the filming style and story sequence, its more experimental and unusual, which was refreshing even if not entirely successful. Although the stylism can get out of hand at times, and sometimes seems rather artificial, the movie does accomplish the feeling of being a video game, which is what I think they were going for more in this installment. The action sequences are overall pretty good, if repetitious, and the story line, although simple-minded, is a decent enough backdrop for the theatrical and showy action scenes.While I still think the third movie, Extinction, is the best one by far, this one I liked a lot more than the last one - ""Afterlife"", which I thought really stank. Nice special effects and visuals, and the 3D was not distracting or annoying, which was welcome (I tend to dislike 3D movies in general)",Resident Evil - Retribution
92,bushtony,Stormy Pleather,3,14 December 2012,"I'll be honest. My main reason for watching these movies is to see Milla Jovovich in sprayed-on pleather. Why exactly I'm not really sure. She has no prominent female physical characteristics to hook my attention – flat-chested and about as curvaceous as a cocktail stick. But when she dons that garb and springs into action, she's sex on legs.It's never really been enough, but this time it's even less so, and it looks as if the law of ever diminishing returns is starting to bite prominently into this franchise in ways that simply cannot be ignored. This is the equivalent of 96 minutes of watching high-definition video game footage play out before your eyes. Previous entries have at least given some meagre impression of being more...more live action experiences rather than complete exercises in almost total CGI. RETRIBUTION feels like a full stop to all that. It has only the scantest relationship with any real-world constructs and is a cold, calculated and clinical exercise that exists as a visual spectacle with no heart and soul.If there is to be another one, I suspect it will be even less of a film and even more of a machine-tooled computer rendered programme. I might still turn up for the pleather, but even that is beginning to lose its shine and glister. This does not bode well.",Resident Evil - Retribution
93,alphahumphrey-54847,Evil!,6,29 February 2020,Its such a shame the 6 year wait for the final RE movie opening was not about the epic battle as seen in the end of this movie.

94,JimmyCollins,A great addition to the franchise.,8,28 October 2012,"I will admit this review is a little bias as I am a very big fan of this franchise and there isn't one of these films that I haven't loved, but honestly this fifth installment is indeed a great one. The big thing for me is the shift in direction this movie took, I cant pinpoint what it is but it just feels different to the others, at the beginning we see the usual ""My name is Alice"" introduction that we've all come to know and love, from then on its a non stop pulse pounding thrill ride that is sure to keep you on your toes. Yes you have to kind of suspend disbelief while watching a Resident Evil movie but that's like most scifi type game stuff, it's not realistic in the least but that's what makes them all so excellent. A lot can be said about Milla, she is the absolute driving force in these films, they wouldn't be as good as they are if someone else were in the role, she never overdoes it and she always kicks ass, however it's good to see a more vulnerable side to her in this installment as she tries to protect a young girl who is her make believe daughter, she's just frakking awesome to put it down to one word. The effects are top notch as usual and as expected, the score is fitting and the colour palette is suited well also, big props for the closing credits song by Bassnectar and Chino Moreno, very cool. Another thing ill mention is the very clever way two characters from previous films were introduced back into the series, Michelle Rodriguez is one tough broad and the Sienna Guillory is cool playing the same character but doing it in an entirely new way.As the film ends we see a set up for the 6th film, and by the looks if it, it's going to be epic. Once it ended I was sitting in the theater just thinking to myself "" ooohhhhh wonder what they'll do with that"". I cannot wait for the next one, hooray.Fans will love it, non fans will love it, and I hope it gains new fans. Excellent. Probably the best in the series.",Resident Evil - Retribution
95,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: Alice versus Umbrella Corp again.,5,14 September 2012,"Resident Evil is the next tale of Project Alice (Milla Jovovich) and it picks up at the point where Afterlife left off, with the released passengers afloat on the Arcadia. The opening scenes were very cleverly shot, and this film has some crisp and impressive CGI. I saw it in 3-D so I will admit that I flinched more than once when things came flying off the screen at me or a zombie seemed to get up close and personal. For those who are not particularly familiar with the series, this film gives a complete synopsis of what has transpired in the previous films from the very beginning up to the current circumstances. Anyone looking for a high body count, loads of action and a hodge-podge of nonsense should see this film. The trailer shows that some of the original characters have returned in this installment and I wanted to see how it was done, since I had personally seen the demise of Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) and others in the first film. Then I thought 'duh', if they can have an inventory of Alice then Umbrella Corp can have a bunch of anyone and everyone. One of those nonsense moments that I mentioned was when Rain first shows up on screen and I thought, if you are trying to escape zombies why would you have your windows open? There were so many other WTF moments, but hey it's based on a video game it doesn't have to make sense, says the woman who at a time frequently played Frogger. The fact that this story originated from a video game was oh so obvious this time around. Almost every scene was reminiscent of being in an arcade standing behind your best friend who has mastered the game and continues to survive through to the next level. The problem is that you quickly bore with cheering your friend on a want some action for yourself. Even with all the acrobatic fights, the mutants, the zombies and the big banging explosions, there were moments when I keep thinking 'how much longer'? The climatic fight scene wasn't even that climatic with Alice squaring off against Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). It was too drawn out for my taste and in the end she did exactly what I was thinking should have been the first defensive move. I am giving this film an amber light, and the only reason it's not a red light is Boris Kodjoe (Luther West).",Resident Evil - Retribution
96,themissingpatient,Retribution - offensive cinema,1,13 December 2012,"Here we have the 5th instalment in the Resident Evil series. I was glad to see the writer & director of the first and last film in the franchise was back in his place for the 5th film. I was wrong to hope for such a thing and can only hope now that this be the last Resident Evil film.The film begins with the writer, Paul W.S. Anderson, and his wife, lead actress Milla Jovovich, telling you that you are stupid. Yes, that is right. We, the audience of this new Resident Evil film, are dumb. They assume we are so dumb that we can't remember the events of the last 4 films. In fact, the time spent on explaining what we already know, we might as well have never watched the first 4 films at all.Now I'm not 100% against re-caps or montages that are done in unique ways to remind us of past events, scenes or films. Now I said ""done in unique ways."" This isn't done in any original new way whatsoever. Instead it is just Milla, as her character Alice, re-telling the story directly to us, the audience. Immediately we are reminded that this is a film, all realism is flushed down the toilet along with any hopes that the Resident Evil film series can maintain any credibility.The film continues to remind us how dumb we must be by using the absolute worse CG effects seen outside of made-for-TV sci-fi movies and children's television shows. 3D or 2D - it does not matter. It is clear to any film enthusiast that this is all shot in front of green screens and the actors/characters are never in any real danger. Therefore pack it up early, even the genius soundtrack masters tomandandy can't save this mess!",Resident Evil - Retribution
97,BigWhiskers,Some nice action sequences but the story line is getting tired,6,15 September 2012,"In a nutshell Resident Evil:Retribution is like watching a live-action version of the popular RE video games more-so than the other sequels. We have scenes of action and martial arts moves which are the best thing about the movie - Alice kicks ass in very cool scenes of various martial arts moves some done in slo-mo so you can see the moves. Then we have the map scenes which show us where the characters are and the different areas locations just like the map option in the games. We have the boss creatures the executioners, the giant licker and the las plagas type zombies. Unfortunately the story itself is lacking with Alice running around killing things and the other characters just chewing the scenery. The plot if there is one is still the same My Name is Alice and here is a recap of what's happened so far - it doesn't tell us any more that what we already know. She may be the original Alice or may be a clone of herself only that she is the only one who is infected that isn't turned into an evil creature . Returning characters like Rain and Carlos show up as clones with both good and evil versions of their former selves, only that they have memories imprinted on them so they are not the same characters they were in the previous movies. Problem is they are wasted in minor roles and could have been dropped entirely. The story is basically one long video game with getting from point a to point b to finish the game. And of course set it up for the sequel which is an all too familiar formula with horror movies these days. The RE video games revolutionized the video gaming world over the years but the novelty has worn off with so many similar type knockoffs in games and movies that you wonder just how much more they can milk off this franchise. The next sequel which I'm sure there will be one . if they can make 10 or so Friday the 13th movies why not make another RE one. 6/10 - mostly for the slick action scenes and martial arts moves.",Resident Evil - Retribution
98,InaneSwine,Awesomely bad,2,18 February 2016,"I was stunned at how awesomely bad this sequel is. Of its 117 minute running time, it featured maybe 3 minutes of dialogue, and they were badly written. The rest of the film was filled with battle sequences that, while fairly visually impressive, are ridiculously long, tedious and, once it passes the ten minute mark for one battle, very boring. Shoddy script, appalling miscasting of Johann Urb(-a-derp) as Leon, and an extremely weird performance from Li Bingbing as Ada, as it appears they've overdubbed every single one of her lines in post-production. Even given the relatively low expectations of the Resident Evil films, this one is a dud. Awful, awful, awful.",Resident Evil - Retribution
99,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION (2012),2,23 September 2012,"All style but no substance is always best characterized Paul W.S. Anderson's directing efforts. In his new movie, RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION -- the fifth installment in the lucrative series -- continues his similar trend of filmmaking style. Suffice to say, whoever expecting Anderson to learn a thing or two about cohesive structure will be left disappointed.But the movie does show some striking potential -- at least in the first 15 minutes. From the minute one, Anderson dazzles the viewers with an innovative opening credits sequences that runs backwards and in glorious slow-motion, showcasing the explosive attack on the Arcadia by a swarm of missile-launching helicopters. It's certainly an attention-grabbing opener, and Anderson continues to strike gold with the following scene involving Alice's (Milla Jovovich) hallucinatory zombies outbreak in a daylight suburbia. For a while there, Anderson shows some credibility in crafting expertly-staged suspenseful moments rarely seen since his EVENT HORIZON (1997). After a few quiet moments in the Umbrella Corporation where Alice finds herself being held captive and slowly tortured for information by her old friend-turned-brainwashed Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), the movie jolts back to vivid life when a system reload allows her to escape (together with a S&M-like skintight suit). She subsequently enters into a simulated Tokyo city at night and gradually being chased by a number of Asian zombies. Again, Anderson makes great use of slow-motion to depict a highly-stylized fight scene. No doubt they are all cool stuff. Of course, if only Anderson continues to maintain that creative momentum for the rest of the movie, RESIDENT EVIL: RETRIBUTION could have been hailed as his most entertaining entry in the series.Unfortunately he loses steam so fast that the subsequent running time is awfully formulaic. From here on, the action -- chase, fistfights, shootouts -- are repetitive and executed in the utmost conventional way possible (Is it because Anderson has exhausted all the budget in the first 15 minutes?).What about the plot? Let's just say Anderson has seemingly thrown away his previous scripts he has wrote for four RESIDENT EVIL movies, jumbled up all of them, and ends up as a patchwork of half-realized ideas. So whoever who are looking for coherent structure to tie back what happen in the previous movies, are best to left their brains at the door and enjoy the mindless ride instead. Oh, wait -- even the word ""enjoy the mindless ride"" isn't enough to warrant this as a solid B-action picture.As for the cast, they are basically the same old stereotypes. Even the presence of Li Bingbing in her first Hollywood role as Ada Wong is particularly wasted here. Her textbook-like line delivery in English is simply wooden, while Johann Urb's performance as the fan-favorite Leon Kennedy is reduced to a thankless role.Likewise, Anderson concludes the movie with an open ending that seemingly promised for something big will happen (the sixth installment is reportedly will be his last series). Let's just hope the sixth entry in the future will be truly his last in the series.http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/",Resident Evil - Retribution
100,drew_atreides,"Finally saw this one, probably one of the better entries...",7,5 July 2013,"... at least given this franchise which, for the most part, has been pretty abysmal... This one was one of the more enjoyable films in the series. I liked the concept of the underwater testing area, i liked having the Red Queen back, and i actually really like the hook of Wesker and Alice working together. The real star of the movie, though, was Sienna Guillory's cleavage. Man i never got tired of staring at it. (haha.)I have to admit i liked seeing Barry and Leon in the movie, as well. The strike team idea was neat to revisit, as it always brings me back to the original concept of Resident Evil with the S.T.A.R.S. squad.I haven't been a huge fan of most of the movies in the series, but this one was watchable.",Resident Evil - Retribution
101,donb-519-335075,No surprises,6,13 November 2012,"By now we know the drift of these stories - cool outfits - a little girl - cooler guns and gunplay - flying around - lots of butt-kicking. So I'll get to my Best and Worst moments: BEST: at the end when Alice is fighting with Jill - the other bad girl gets ready for battle by injecting herself in the neck with a serum which is going to make her invincible - and there is a big hairy ugly bug in the syringe!!! It must work as she gets shot a couple of dozen times - and she spits the bullets out of her fingertips - pretty cool. I also enjoyed when she was fighting the two (burly) males (good guys) - one of them smashes her directly in the face with a fire extinguisher & she does not even flinch (a bad chick). The worst was the little girl being abducted by the big monster - and then being rescued by Alice - pure cheese - and of the dozens of pods she could have been in, Alice chooses the right one on the first try.Overall I liked it enough, but then, I had low expectations.

102,trnjamesbond,Resident Evil A Gamers Nightmare!,1,6 December 2012,"For some reason I feel even worse than when I watched the previous film in the theatre. What is going on in this new instalment? First our eyes glance at the screen force feeding our brains with some slow motion reverse shot in the beginning sequence. Then we move to the already mundane ""Alice"" narrative.Let's move on shall we? Now the next scene in the film shows what we just already seen and totally got the point of, but now the film is moving forward of what was just in reverse in the opening shot. I call this time filler for the weak and pathetic storyline.As we travel through this moronic film, and subsequently figure out that Alice is now once again imprisoned, by Umbrella, and must escape the undergrounds of yet, another compound. Except she learns she has to go through ""Holographic"" testing arena's, using all the characters from the past as some emotional response from Alice. Wow, I feel like I'm standing on the Star Trek The Next Generation holo-deck and can't find the discontinue program button! Now as Alice moves through the sub-terrain Umbrella facility, we see familiar faces and familiar enemy's some left over from the previous film, including the giant carrying the hammer axe, and once again seeing the same slow motion axe wielding shots. Some of the film scene's included Alice in the earlier times living in suburbia. Well with this scene all I could think of is ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake, that's all that scene did for me. My apologies go out to the ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake fans. Yes they stole from that script also.For my final statement I must say this film offers nothing new to the series, it also doesn't offer us anything to think about, there is a lot of time filler scenes, monotonous over dwelling storyline shots, I just can't figure out why they would even make this pathetic film. I don't consider it part of this franchise, I just call it as I see it. That being said, I think it is just an hour and a half rerun. Simply put, don't waste your time. The one star for my rating is for the poor actors/actresses that are a part of this garbage and did what they had to do for a pay check. Now for the film running time. It's says it's about 1 hr 31 mins, but visually it's only about 1 hr 22 mins, the rest of the 9 mins goes to ending credits, I think they put that in slow motion too. What a mess! Not only do we have 9 mins of ending credit's(which is almost unheard of, but a terrible ending indeed). This just proves my original thought that this film was cheaply written and produced, this reminds me of the 80's, what they use to do to slasher films. It's starting all over again. Actually I'd rather watch those cheesy slasher films than this incoherent storyline. I feel like this is the ""Frankenstein"" of the R/E franchise.The first parts of the franchise takes itself seriously, but this film like I said makes itself look cheaply slapped together in writing, all the while using big budget effects, well sorry to say, visual special effects can't save a storyline, not even in 3D, there is no script here that we haven't seen before, this script makes you feel like taking it to the nearest paper shredder you can find.Note to writers for this film! No more R/E films please, you all suck at writing! I wish I could make a bet with all the idiot money men for this franchise, first of all they have no clue what Resident Evil is, and second I would put my money on all the R/E gaming fans that they could write a stellar script. It would be a million times better than this stinking dirty diaper of a film! Just end this terrible story line that's all I ask of the production company. Stop this madness!Thanks for reading.",Resident Evil - Retribution
103,twilliams76,I bet you've seen this before ...,3,3 January 2013,"Five films in and these things just keep getting better and better and better ... and I'm lying. They are actually almost exactly the same (the only difference is a recurring castmate who might return for every other film to help Alice).Once again Alice (Milla Jovovich - The Fifth Element, Ultraviolet) finds herself in trouble at the hands of the Umbrella Corporation who has (again) developed lethal killing machines/beings/plagues that want to wreak havoc on the remains of humanity (after the first Resident Evil movie over ten years ago). This film is nearly as braindead as the Umbrella-engineered zombies found in the film's first half.The film is so bad that during a zombie attack scene, I asked myself why nobody on the streets fleeing had carried a black umbrella ... they were a multitude of colors with nary a black one in sight. It doesn't matter at all ... but neither does the film.If one wants to continue the tales of Alice, by all means watch this one; but you've seen this before. The entire premise of this fifth film is Alice escaping from a training facility and so every door she enters is simply a new scenario -- that is it. Yawn ... it is always more of the same! No wonder I was so intrigued by black umbrellas.",Resident Evil - Retribution

105,JamesIan2021,Best Of The Franchise,8,2 May 2015,"This franchise has garnered a strong fan-base, yet each addition has had it's critical lashing but been huge at the box office, grossing just short of a billion over it's five feature run making it the most successful video game adaptation. I will always thank one of my mates for getting me into this series, as each addition has been released these zombie slashing movies have gotten better and better, and Retribution is the defining entry, a magnificent adventure. Milla Jovovich is back as the ultimate female action hero in ""Resident Evil: Retribution"", a brilliant addition to the Zombie-Slaying franchise. Some may think this franchise is running on empty, but I disagree, and this entry features a neat twist added to this instalment which will take you by surprise and keeps things fresh (The film is actually set in artificially controlled environments) Not without it's flaws, there is one moment between Leon and Alice where he tells her not to go after her daughter, it's either the editing here between cuts or the acting, this part felt off key and it's rather cringe, but for every awry line there are plenty of bad-ass lines before and after fights. There are some great stand offs where the characters stare down at each other, there's tension and an element of surprise, getting you ready for the action to explode! And when it does the 3D effects are perfection:- Debris, zombie limbs, gun barrels, bullets and numerous objects soar out the screen at wild speeds, and spectacular depth effects enable the landscape to stretch far into the screen leaving you jaw dropped. Paul W.S Anderson proves yet again that he is the master of 3D immersion, action scenes have never looked so good! Retribution sees Project Alice continue her battle against Umbrella, who have built a giant facility underwater to further test the deadly T-Virus. Using the virus, Umbrella manipulate the world around her and turn people against Alice, most of whom she used to work with, forcing her to up her game in her mission to finish them once and for all. The cloning plot allows Michelle Rodriguez, Colin Salmon and Oded Fehr to reprise their roles, although they don't have much dialogue they still prove they are worthy to make a comeback. For me, this movie has one of the utmost best opening sequences ever, it's like watching 3D action-movie perfection unfold on screen: All edited to go in reverse, Umbrella reign hell on the Arcadia ship, every single camera work is an action shot, it is jaw dropping, beautiful, the definition of epic and masterfully constructed, and Tomandandy's soundtrack plays over it upping the scale of awesome to the top. The Tokyo Corridor of Light fight scene also is one of the best fights I've seen in a movie, the fight choreography is truly spectacular, the editing is swift and cut perfectly making sure continuity flows, which is does perfectly, and the use of 3D here is utterly astounding, in fact a reference quality moment that I'd use to demo my set-up with. Retribution does focus on action more than story, but not at an alarming level, the twists are relatively interesting but obvious yet it pushes the story into exciting territory. Would I watch this again? Already have, at least a dozen times, with near perfect 3D, tough characters, mind-blowing fight sequences, stunning visuals, a rocking soundtrack and a truly epic finale, Retribution is a soaring entry that hits hard and stands tall in the franchise, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over again, unless you rated it rotten.",Resident Evil - Retribution
106,RoboRabbit89,"No plot, No story but lots of action. Simply a mindless action movie.",6,20 March 2018,"Let me put this simply as I can, this is a mindless action movie.
I think Paul W.S. Anderson the director and writer was starting to
run out of ideas and it shows, but I personally liked it because
we had some of the same characters we already knew and I think
it sort of works manly for the action. The action scenes were great, the film makes no sense at all 
mind you, but mostly works because it's action scenes.
Put simply, it's inconsistent in story for whatever reasons, 
I think some people that are fans of these films said there was
more story from what I remember, but it was scrapped because
""Sony"" the studio I guess didn't like it, and they wanted it as a mindless
action movie? I think?Anyway, Milla is good as always for this series and I like her sexy
costume that fits well on her sexy shape and makes her look like
an S&M dominatrix which is awesome.
Also it's just fun seeing her kick zombie ass in slow motion,
from what I remember she is in some kind of facility of Umbrella's
and she has to get out for whatever reasons, that's basically the plot.Most may not like it but I did, for me, I'm an action fan and
a fan of this series, it really hit the spot, this one delivers action unlike the others.I give it a 6/10. Not great in story but satisfying in action.
If your a fan of these films give it a look. It's the last decent one.",Resident Evil - Retribution
107,aaronjbong,It Goes On ...,5,16 September 2012,"""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is strictly for fans of the series and for those who love mindless, long action sequences filled with blood. Period. Anyone expecting a storyline or strong performances should stay away with this film.The ""Resident Evil"" series has reached its fifth installment and this latest one delivers the same thing it's good at: mindless action scenes. There is hardly a storyline here. The opening sequence of the film runs way too long. That takes roughly fifteen minutes off the ninety-minute run. It directly takes place where the last film left off and Alice is captured by the Umbrella Corporation once again. Then, with unlikely help from Albert Wesker, she plans to escape the facility (now controlled by the Red Queen, that AI girl) by going through replicas of cities which are used as testing ground for experiments by the Umbrella Corporation. That's it.The replicas explain the numerous environments portrayed in the trailer. Actually, it's only one place. The trailer also displayed the return of some characters that appeared in the previous installments. We see the return of Michelle Rodriguez as Rain Ocampo, Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, and some others who died in the previous films. They're actually just clones, made to serve the Umbrella Corporation. However, there are also good clones of them, which are used to be part of the simulations.""Retribution"" is full of mindless action sequences that never seem to stop. You won't have time to take a breath before the next action sequence begins. The fight choreography is outstanding and the 3D enlivens the scenes. That's probably the shining spot of the whole film.Other than that, the film is decent at best. I wonder if there will be a sequel to this film. Director Paul W. S. Anderson stated that the sixth installment will conclude the series. If that is so, then the last shot of this film sets up a good atmosphere for the next film.Rating: 5/10 Final Verdict: ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" will attract fans and action buffs but will not be suitable for others who want a clear story and convincing performances.",Resident Evil - Retribution
108,dutchchocolatecake,good grief,4,13 January 2013,"Since the first movie, non-gamer fans of Resident Evil have come to expect certain things out of the movies. We expect to have halfway decently written characters. We expect elaborate, perhaps unrealistic action sequences that are fun to watch. We expect a little humor. We expect a little bonding and empathy, just enough to make us give a crap about what happens with the characters. We expect a basic plot that isn't too stupid, so we *want* to sit through the movie and find out what happens in the end (also, so we can get a glimpse of what the next movie might be like in the ending scenes).We know the movies aren't perfect. We know that they are based off of a video game. We know that we aren't paying to see Oscar winning performances or realism. We're asking to be entertained, and to see what happens next in the story. That's not asking a lot.But this movie does NOT deliver what fans have come to expect from the series. We expect to see an installment that either competently continues the storyline or provides insight into what we've already seen. That's what the movies have offered all this time. But not this one (and ""kind of"" doesn't count).This movie is a non-stop action sequence with very little dialog, a bunch of macho posturing, and elements that didn't fit or made no sense. Why make Alice a mother, a ""sort of"" mother because a child clone just happens to fall in her lap? Why have her magically know sign language to communicate with the child clone? Why have an elaborate fight scene with the Umbrella employee, all for it to end with her grabbing the robot-spider-thingie off her chest? If it was that easy, why not do it in the first place? Alice is anything but blind, and with lightening fast reflexes. Just have her yank the thing off and be done with it.At this point the series should be wrapping up, and with it the plot should be thickened, not diluted. There is absolutely no reason in the world to introduce a simulated environment at this stretch of the ball game. What's the point? To rehash what I've already seen? Useless. To fill in prospective fans when Alice does a predictably dead-pan hash up before EACH AND EVERY GODFORSAKEN MOVIE IN THE SERIES? Useless. The writers missed a golden opportunity to write a good movie, to entice said prospective fans into actually paying money to see the other movies. Instead, they wanted to regurgitate the entire mess, without a Nevada sandstorm.And why introduce previous characters that serve no purpose except to be killed off again? Useless. Why introduce new characters when the movie can't show the audience what they offer to the overall story? Useless. Implying that Alice decides to shrug off her grudge against crew-cut-blonde-in-sunglasses dude just strains credulity in her character map. Useless.I have no reason to believe that fighting the Red Queen is going to be a climax of judgment day, possibly wrapping up the series. Resident Evil: Retribution SHOULD have been the movie to make me believe that by using a real plot with rudimentary written characters. It fails for the reasons above, and then some.I gave this movie a generous 4 out of 10. Not absolute rubbish but getting very close to it. I guess I hold out some shred of hope that all this crap is relevant in the next movie. I'm not holding my breath, though.",Resident Evil - Retribution
109,culmo80,Only a few Redeeming Parts of this Movie...,4,20 August 2013,"And yes, they involve the women wearing tight-fitting or revealing costumes...That said, there's little else in the film that makes it good. The plot is about as complex as something you'd get out of elementary school. The acting is minimal; Milla Jovovich likes her character, but at this point what else is there to say about Alice? The rest of the cast does an adequate job. The action is almost non-stop, but its all been done before. Even the creatures are all re-treads. The setting is a mishmash between the first and second movies...with a slight, but minor twist. Spoilers:The plot is essentially that Alice has been captured and needs to be saved so she can save humanity...oops, that's not it exactly, but everyone knows that if they have seen the other films in this series. We're told that Alice can help find the weapon. Of course Alice has to fight her way through the maze of the under-ice base (which the Umbrella Corporation took ownership from COBRA after GI JOE defeated them in the first GI JOE movie). Wesker somehow survived, and is now a good guy. He sends a team to save Alice, most of whom end up dying as is usually the case. The big ""shocks"" of the movie aren't the zombies or the super-creatures, but the appearances of previously-dead characters. As it turns out they are just clones. There's some attempt to make the scenes where they all meet cool, but you just end up not caring. They might as well be masked faceless goons who die by the dozen in every shootout. Speaking of which...it always amazes me how the main characters are impervious to bullets (except when a character needs a convenient wound).The best part of the movie is the last 3 minutes or so when we get the glimpse of the light at the end of the tunnel for this series...though we've been fooled before. This is a series that could have - and should have - been wrapped up about 2 movies ago. I mean think about, the first film set up the world of Resident Evil, the second really displayed the new Alice...the third film should have been Alice being the savior of mankind or something...instead we've had a series of plodding movies that lose all their value after a few minutes of boredom and ""been there, done that.""This film isn't worth buying or paying money for. Rent it on Netflix or watch it on TV. If it weren't for Sienna Guillory in her tight blue catsuit, Milla Jovovich in her tight black bondage gear, or Li Bingbing in her revealing red dress, nobody would have watched the whole thing...which is why I gave it a 4...for the eye candy.",Resident Evil - Retribution
110,dineshaishu,Resident evil: retribution,7,29 July 2019,"I've been a long time fan of the Resident Evil series even when people criticized them left and right. I thought they were really entertaining, stylish and inventive. Until now. There is no way I can stick up for this movie or any reason I'd even want to. I can't really give you a synopsis cause I'm not even sure what I just watched. All I can say is that it was huge disappointment in every facet possible. Despite the silliness of the previous films they always grounded themselves in some type of realism within the reigns of its premise. This entry doesn't even feel like it's a part of the same franchise. Gone is the fun and it's been replaced with ritzy production values and no discernible storyline. It's a movie based on a video game in which they are actually part of a video game and nothing is really happening. Despite a somewhat promising start with a cool reverse battle sequence, a best of franchise film reel and an inventive and even a little scary trip into suburbia we than move on to the supposed purpose of the film which just doesn't make sense at all. I mean the choices are just astoundingly bad why make the little girl deaf and the film filled with sign language, why set it in this underground facility, why is all of this happening, with this type of technology how does the remaining human population even have a chance, how is Wesker alive and why is he good now? he's not human??? None of these questions will be answered and lets not even discuss the frustratingly awkward scenes like one in which one of the good guys has a double unnecessary death, an uninspired nod towards the Alien franchise and repetitive scenarios that get less effective the more you see them (really the squid face things). Also, the acting has never been good in the Resident Evil series but Milla Jovovich had evoked a cool sense of fierce heroine, this time around she just seems plain bored as do the other actors. Filled with insipid dialogue, questionable plotting,overlong pacing, a weird bad movie from the 90's score, mediocre fight choreography (except for the scene with the chain) and a crapload of wasted potential this movie just feels like a bad dream. Sometimes, when I'm really looking forward to a movie I'll dream about it the night before and it will be horrible well this is what this feels like. Because in no possible way, what I just watched is a resident evil movie. Despite all of my complaining the movie does have some decent scenes the suburbia one I brought up before was kinda neat, another featuring Ada and Alice against 2 ax men and the chain fight in Tokyo. Besides that it's all just a big plodding waste of existential cinematic trash. A brainless, soulless unintentionally funny horror/action/sci fi hybrid that despite a larger budget,returning cast members and more impressive production values feels like an overlong filler episode that leaves me with a big question mark. Why has this happened to my beloved franchise???",Resident Evil - Retribution
111,nathanjamesemerson,Much better then the previous installment,7,24 September 2018,"This is the fifth movie in the Resident Evil series.I was suprised when I saw this as it was much better then the rather dismal fourth film which preceded it.Again we have Alice continuing her fight with Umbrella. There are also returning characters Wesker, Jill, Rain and Carlos from previous films. We are also introduced to new characters from the game such as Leon, Ada and Barry.Sadly the new characters are not much like their video game counterparts. We are also introduced to a young girl Becky.The action scenes are well done and much better then the previous film. Again cloning is still the big topic of the film, and they should have given it a rest. Yeah clones, big deal. Had enough of that rubbish in the previous two films.The movie was really enjoyable to me despite this. They tried to go for a different feel and they mostly succeeded. But don't get too excited at the end of the film. They set it up brilliantly for a massive showdown and sadly they don't do anything with it in the next film. Nothing comes of it.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Anderson.That means.1) Visually beautiful. Personally, I think Paul W.S. Anderson has an incredible eye of cinematography. His films have scenes that are truly breathtakingly beautiful to me.2) Great action!3) Great over-the-top-defying-gravity-n-logic stunts!4) Great creatures and special effects!5) Mila Jovovich in skin tight leather kicking butt!6) Great use of 3D! I personally find Paul's films have some of the best use of this technology.7) A thin veneer of a plot, just enough to string together the action scenes.8) Minimal character depth - just enough to keep you from hating the actors.9) Plot holes that you can drive a mack truck through, and logic that will make your head hurt - if you spend any time really thinking about it.Looking at this list, do you think 'Cool! I want to see it!"" or do you focus on #7 through 9 and go ""ugh, another dumb big action film.""I believe how you answer that question will decide whether or not you will like the film.Me?

113,dinalt10,Worst in the series by far,4,1 February 2013,"This contains some spoilers - though the script is so simple that any spoilers won't ruin it too much anyway.Let's start with the positives - Milla still looks and acts the part of Alice perfectly. But that's the only positive.So onto the film - which starts with pretty much a wasted introduction, a slow motion rewind which eventually plays out properly, and the usual 'My name is Alice' prologue.The rest of the film is essentially a waste of space. Too many 'virtual' worlds that become dull one after the other - they look pretty, but there's never any suspense or even vaguely scary moments.Then there are the characters bought back from the preceding films. This was what I was looking forward to most, but it's a wasted opportunity and they may as well be the undead for all the use they are. Luther was still alive, but just dies in this one for no apparent reason - and no real reason for him being there in the first place.The real kicker though is that Alice is supposed to have no special powers in this film (having lost them previously). Yet you wouldn't realise this by watching the film - okay, she was highly trained by Umbrella - but you wouldn't notice any real difference between non special and special Alice. (She doesn't get reinfected until the end of the film). Yet she takes beating after beating and still carries on almost as normal - that's taking the suspense of belief a little too far.Visually the film is good - great action and sets, but let down by the complete absence of any shade of realism or meaningful dialogue. (I know it's based on a video game, but the previous films at least managed suspense - and showed Alice vulnerable at times).Then you've got the infected in the Moscow zone driving, shooting guns, using chainsaws etc etc................maybe this is an enhancement by the Red Queen, but it's never explained why they can suddenly do everything the humans can.The previous 4 films were each good in their own way - whereas Retribution's likely to be remembered only for the effects. Maybe it was filmed like this for the 3D audience, but in 2D this film sucks.Hopefully RE6 (if it's ever done) will make up for this turkey.",Resident Evil - Retribution
114,botrytis,Seriously?,3,7 February 2013,"Let's put the obvious fact on the table: It's a new-gen. trash movie, which doesn't deserve any explanation, so I'm going to talk about the differences between RE1 and This.RE1 was a decent zombie-action flick with really dark\horroristic atmosphere, many parts in it are frightening: like having a zombie outbreak ""six feet under"" which was due to a man's action, even that is scary that people were capable to experiment on such things. And that theme, well, it still gives me the creeps. At least the first RE had merits, but from that point every other part was a downfall throughout the series. RE5 is a typical 3D popcorn movie with it's flashy and yet still lame effects, and poor/static camera views which are due to the intention to see this movie only in 3D. The story has nothing logical saying whatsoever ... the opponents are so cheesy that makes this movie even more 'omega' categorized. Now the positive things for me:-The RE5 theme (you know, the catchy one) was good, at least it has good melody and shows the differences between RE1 scary tone, representing the movie's more intention going on the action-way, if the motion picture is not scary anymore. -The ending had some suspensions (The fighting scenes, and the underwater view was pretty beautiful, some of the pictures here are pretty awesome actually)-The no-name bearded ally marine was pretty funny at his death scene, (he raised his arms, getting shot, lying down, catch his pistole, shoot the mudafu*a, then raises his hands again, and getting shot ... again), That was badass, cheesy, funny at the same time.really bad things:-Russian zombies with weapons ... (Seriously? act 1)-The Alien-like egg scene was so plastic, it made the movie ,again, omega categorized (They could have made it more disgusting with more realistic sticky fluids, and make it more suspenseful, let the actress fight through the eggs-wall with yawning with bloody effects. Seriously? act 2) -I'm not a big RE game fan, but I guess some of the new characters had some connections with the games. For what? It doesn't make it more trustworthy.-The whole story background ... come on, how the hell had we come from the classy virus-zombie-outbreak story to this... actually, I don't get the picture in these previous movies either, but I don't even want to get it. (Seriously? act 3)-They still want to make more sequels ... (Seriously? act 4)That's all I got now, I feel really sorry for Milla Jovovich, I really like her, she's talented in many ways, yet she stars in such craps. P.S.: Did you see how long the credits is? How many people worked on it?... Jesus Christ, the humanity!...",Resident Evil - Retribution
115,jefflouvre-435-77367,"More explosions, more bodies and more boredom",1,13 September 2012,"THE fifth installment in the Resident Evil series pummels viewers into submission with its non-stop action.Everywhere you turn, bullets are flying and bombs are exploding. The movie's artificial and glossy look remains, but there is no heartbeat beneath the special effects.The bullet and body counts probably exceed those in The Expendables 2, and readers know what I thought about the latter.Alice (Milla Jovovich) does the same thing that she has done in the four previous flicks. She wears her skintight black outfit and arms herself with all kinds of guns known to man, and then she blows up and kills everything and everyone that stand in her way.You don't need a genius to create a story about her still battling zombies. Just put her in any situation and let her blow her way out her troubles.Alice now finds herself in a huge Umbrella underwater installation that's conducting Godknows how many tests on the virus that caused the zombie permutation in humans. So viewers find sites dedicated to scenarios such as suburbia, New York, Tokyo, Moscow and Berlin.Naturally, our intrepid hero and a Chinese agent in a red slinky dress, Ada Wong (Li Bingbing), must go through all these scenarios with their customary gumption. In the process, they rack up a body count that would make male viewers tremble in their shoes.I presume that Li is starring in her first English movie, because her pronunciation is stilted, but it's certainly better than that of Jay Chou in The Green Hornet (2011).On the way, Alice discovers the virtues of being a mother when she comes upon a cute female child who's in distress, similar to the kid rescued by Ripley in Aliens (1986). What follows is also similar to that in James Cameron's flick, and Alice even goes to the extent of saving the kid caught and placed in a cocoon.** www.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)",Resident Evil - Retribution
116,badfeelinganger,"""Retribution"" has actually got some very decent action and 3D effects. The story is still razor-thin.",8,13 October 2014,"Resident Evil's appeal as a series is almost exclusively rooted in Jovovich's charisma. She combines the enigmatic magnetism of a silent-movie siren with the bravado of an action hero.Anderson is often mistakenly dismissed as a hack but the artist is actually working within the confines of Hollywood genre cinema, constantly transcending and elevating it through the triumph of his avant-Gardie visual sensibility. For those of us who know what we're in for with the series, the fifth instalment is for better or worse, more of the same - albeit with the familiar levels of ridiculousness from its maddeningly inconsistent director/writer .If you liked the other Resident Evil films, you'll like this, and the end suggests there'll be plenty more. A mildly entertaining piece of eye-candy.Paul W.S. Anderson's writing may not have blown minds and our characters may not be up for any awards, but Resident Evil: Retribution showcases tantalising big budget action on a stylistically provocative level.You either enjoy buff female and male characters in tight, form-fitting outfits shooting at zombies and each other, or you don't. It's really that simple. We do not expect quality from Resident Evil any longer. We expect our brains to be expunged of common sense and pumped full of endorphins wearing fetish costumes.The movie is convoluted, of course, but it is also slick, savage and thrilling.",Resident Evil - Retribution
117,RyanEberhart,Excellent!,10,3 September 2013,"I hate this one, NOT! This is my favorite of all of the Resident Evil movies. Why? How could you not like a movie that has Alice (Milla Yovovich) as a mom in some scenes and dressed in a skin tight leather type outfit? I will never make excuses about appreciating the female form.I didn't like the opening sequence. It was decided to take the attack by Umbrella on the ship Arcadia in backward slow motion. It gave me a headache. I liked that you got to see the attack in both directions, eventually leading to the capture of Alice, but I could have done without the backward slow motion.When the movie first begins we see Alice is married to Carlos. Yes, I said Carlos! As in Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) from the second and third movies. But Carlos died at the end of Resident Evil: Extinction. However, he is back Resident Evil: Retribution. And as Alice's husband. If that isn't mind boggling enough, Alice and Carlos have a daughter.Carlos is attacked in their home, but Alice and Becky (Aryana Engineer) escape. They climb into their attic and eventually make it outside where they see chaos erupting in their suburban neighborhood. Alice and Becky almost get hit by a car driven by Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). YES, I said Rain! But, Rain died in the first movie, you say? Well she's back! As Rain, Alice and Becky drive off, being chased by the undead, their car is t-boned by a garbage truck. Alice and Becky leave Rain in the car, believing she is dead, and take refuge in a nearby house. Alice hides Becky and she is eventually attacked by her husband, Carlos. Of course I like this scene because it depicts Alice as a regular woman, wife and mother, with no hint of what she really is.The fight scenes are pretty damn good in this movie. Like the first scene where Alice is fighting a group of Chinese undead. She uses a chain with a lock and a handgun with two, what looks like, ten or twelve round clips to kill about ten or twelve undead. Another pretty good scene is when Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and her security team track down Alice and Ada Wong (Li Bingbing). Alice had found Becky in the same house as before, that is where Jill found Alice, Ada and Becky. I won't go into detail about this scene, but I will say that it is pretty good. The Moscow fighting is pretty good also.I like the final fight scene best. It has Alice fighting Jill. Both are evenly matched, but Alice eventually takes the scarab device on Jill's chest off. Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) and Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb) fight with the evil Rain, who has injected herself with a solution that includes the T-Virus. Rain eventually kills Luther, apparently, but Alice shoots at the ice under Rain's feet and she falls into the water. Rain tries to climb out of the hole but is dragged back into the hole by some undead.I give this Resident Evil movie 10 out of 10 stars. I can't wait for the next movie coming in 2014. I hope it is as good or better as Resident Evil: Retribution.",Resident Evil - Retribution
118,lethalweapon,Yet another Resident Evil movie,5,7 December 2012,"The apparently ageless Milla Jovovich returns as the ex-Umbrella Corporation employee, Alice, who has fought against her evil company and their zombie weapons for 4 movies in the past.The last installment of the franchise had Alice facing an endless horde of enemies in copters in a cliffhanger ending. Retribution continues from there, with Alice getting captured and interrogated in a top secret, bottom dwelling facility. The T virus, which has mutated almost the entire race of humans into extinction, has gone out of control, and the erstwhile villain, Wesker, seeks Alice's help in fighting human extinction. He arranges a rescue team who will break into the facility and get Alice's hive.This is the plot; or as much of an excuse for a plot you can get. The truth is that the Resident Evil franchise stopped creating plots by the end of the first movie and now markets acrobatic zombie sequences tied together by one common character.For a movie that is almost exclusively full of action sequences, it falls short compared to the previous installment. The scale of ridiculousness, however, is maintained, despite sequences featuring Nazi zombies. And these Nazi zombies ride bikes, cars, and use guns/ rocket launchers, etc in a marked departure from the average zombie who just walks slowly with arms outstretched.The movie ends on another cliffhanger, promising an even better plot less string of action sequences for the next movie.",Resident Evil - Retribution

120,Alise_shenle,Spectacular,7,29 September 2012,"I watched this film in 2D so I will definitely rewatch it soon. The opening was cool. Ever since RE3, all the openings were epic. RE5 managed to top the previous ones--with the backwards scene. I liked all the action, it was less Alice and more of other characters including Ada, Leon, Luther, Jill and Rain. Also the new actors were great, Li Bingbing's English is fantastic, and she really looked like Ada. I did not really like Leon because I pictured Jensen Ackles (Dean from Supernatural) to act as Leon (because they are both emo and broody). This Leon is too ""not serious"" and he does not have a solid stage presence. Alice also looked hotter with age, did anyone notice she looked like Taylor Swift in her ""suburban housewife"" outfit. The parts I didn't really like is there are no real ""zombies"". I prefer seeing how normal humans survive in the apocalyptic world and not really action fighters). Also, I notice that RE characters like to move it movie. When Ada and Alice were ""hurrying"", they strode coolly then when they hear the ""standby"" they just said ""Let's move"", which is weird because they were moving already... Leon kept on telling the guys to move... And the first word that Alice said to Jill in RE2 is ""MOVE!"" The ridiculous ""repeatings"" of the word move and the totally serious tone they used made it funny. Also, many people were confused whether Alice is an original or not, so the director should show more, instead of suddenly have Ada telling the audience about clones. That being said, RE5 was pure solid action with spectacular sets and really, RE series just keeps getting better and better.",Resident Evil - Retribution

122,razvan-rogoz,Little girl & ending saves the movie; worst in the series,4,27 September 2012,"*** CONTAINS SPOILERS ***I like to RE series. I've seen the first two movies long before the games. And then I've played RE 1 to 4 and almost all the WII titles. So I must say, I'm at least familiar with the background, characters and settings of this world. The first RE movie was awesome. I've saw it at least five times on HBO and other TV sources. The second was decent. The third was mildly interesting. The fourth was rather boring. And the fifth was awful compared to the first two. Let me explain to you why. First of all, the story is sub par. I understand that it's an action horror so I don't expect a ""Gone with the wind"" quality of the story. However, there were only two interesting moments in the entire plot.The first one was the little girl. I felt the connection real and she was the really character I gave a damn in the entire movie. I knew that Alice would survive (as there must be at least 10 sequels) but I cared deeply if the girl died or not. This kept my interest up and made me stay until the end in the cinema theater. The second one was the ending. (ONCE AGAIN, SPOILER ALERT). Wesker becomes president, he leads the rest of the US army against the red queen, that AI from the first movie and ""enhances"" Alice. I must say, it is an interesting premise for the next movie in the series, even if I hope that will be the last one, as the entire plot in Retribution could have been summed up in 25 - 30 minutes and not in an full length movie.Alice was interesting, the semi-naked scene from the start seemed forced, the suburbia zombie scene was interesting but it did not impress me and the other characters fall flat. Ada Wong was arrogant, competent, powerful in RE4 and here she comes as an inferior version to Alice. The 3D scenes, some of them were awesome, some of them seemed forced just for the sake of a 3D effect. The sound was decent, the music was not special (lost in the background) and the film quality is inferior to most high budget movies in 2012. So what's the final verdict here?Each movie, well, almost each movie pushed the series ahead a bit, at least story wise. The first three movies showed the effects of the virus rather well. The fourth was not as fast paced but decent. The fifth was more as a spin-off and only the last minutes of the movies - meeting Wesker actually pushed the story ahead a bit. And if you leave aside the story there are some cool zombie kicking scenes but that's all. I'm disappointed. I'm glad I've seen this movie but this is so much worse than I've thought it would be.",Resident Evil - Retribution
123,JamesMitchell451,A surprising fun ride,7,13 August 2013,"I came into this movie prepared to hate on this movie, I was prepared to DESTROY it. Yet, in the end I actually dug this film. Is it a good movie? Oh hell no, but I had a blast with this installment, and it is one of (If not the) the best video game movies yet. The plot of Retribution has Alice captured by Umbrella Corporation and basically trapped in their underground facility which (Spoiler alert, for those who actually pay attention to the plot of these movies) is run by the Red Queen A.I from the first film, who has since then gone even more homicidal since then, now Alice must stop her from exterminating humanity. The story is dumb, yet it helps propel the film forward and the pacing is always moving forward, it never stops and that is a good thing here. The script has taken several huge leaps since the last installments, while its not ""Good"" it is more humane, funny, quirky, and entertaining. I also really like how they brought in almost everyone from the games, such as the swagged out Leon Kennedy and Barry Burton, along with some returning faces from earlier installments like ""One"" and ""Rain"". I found their interactions with each other interesting and they truly felt like characters from the game (Which is good or bad, depending on your point of view). The best part of this film (Which came as a surprise to me) was the action scenes. The battles are EPIC, and so much fun to watch, they had me by the balls and kept me engaged throughout. The special effects have also taken a major leap forward, and the constantly changing scenery helps keep things fresh. While I don't consider Retribution a good film, matter of fact: its stupid. Yet I had a massive amount of fun with it. It's the clear-cut place of a guilty pleasure for me, and now I'm curious to see how the next installment is. And as for those gamers mad that the movies aren't like the games I say this: Have you seen or played Resident Evil 5, or better yet Resident Evil 6? Those games are quite stupid, especially in their plot and dialogue, and if you disagree then I actually feel sorry for you.",Resident Evil - Retribution
124,alucardvenom,Little Paul's school project....,2,10 January 2013,"I've never been a fan of Resident Evil movies, but I thought first one was enjoyable. It know exactly what it is, a action horror movie based on popular video game series. Second movie was campy, but enjoyable. After that, the only thing that RE movies did for me is surprise me how much awful next installment can be compared to preview one.""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is fifth (I think) movie in the series. At it clearly shows. After a long and boring intro scene, we get recap of another pointless ""Previously on Resident Evil series"" where Alice explains what happen in the last four movies (pretty much nothing to be specific).Then we get to the main plot line: Alice must escape from point A to point B. That's it. Are you kidding me? The characters never had any development in Resident Evil series, but this one doesn't even bother with it. Few new characters from the game are thrown into this pile of mess, without even explaining who they are. If you never played any of the RE games, you'll have a big problem understanding who these characters are. What fallows after ""plot exposition"" is just around a hour of action scenes, which are not that interesting. Some scenes are just randomly placed, others are taken from preview movies, and others are just taken from video game (with replaced settings and character, but otherwise, they are just badly copied from games, like a Wesker- Redfields fight from preview movie).Milla Jovovich, while not the best actress out there in Hollywood, is still charming, but her character stopped evolving after second movie. In this one, she is just a female character who shoots other characters. I am not blaming Milla, it's not her fault that script is so godawful.Sienna Guillory is no better. She might be pretty, but her acting skills are bit higher then acting skills of a spoon. She looks hot in that tight outfit, but most of the time she looked bit awkward in scenes she's in (and she's hardly ever there). Girl, go back to modeling, you can't act. Johann Urb plays fan favorite Leon, but aside from similar look, he isn't nowhere like Leon from the games. His character is just there so he could shoot other characters... and did I mention how boring action scenes were?Michelle Rodriguez returns once again as Rain, or clone of Rain... or whatever she is suppose to be. I actually like Michelle as an actress, but she is just badly directed here. It's like they wanted her in this movie but didn't know what to do with her, so they just throw her in yet another... you guest it, action scene.Shawn Roberts plays Albert Wesker yet again... and yet again, he's nothing like Albert Wesker from the games. He's not menacing, he's not creepy, he just speaks slow and wears too much hair gel. oh yeah, and I should mention that Ada Wong makes her appearance here, as a stereotypical Chinese spy character (even her voice is stereotypical). Again, this is nothing like Ada Wong from video games, where she can actually be interesting character (depending on which game we are talking about).Now, to the director and writer himself - Mr. Paul W.S. Anderson (a guy considered to be one of the worst directors ever). How can you put your name after ""written by""? He seriously wrote this? This is no script, this is just compilation of action scenes connected by 30 second bridge scene. The whole scripts look like a bad fan fiction of a 10-year-old boy after playing the game. Direction is even worse. After being in a industry since 1994, you could at least hope Anderson picked up some skills, but no. He did not. He used some of the most boring angles. Edition is really bad, especially when it comes to action scenes. Scenes with RED QUEEN are just laughable (they look like some cut scenes EA Games could come up with)and Mr. Anderson, who the hell could you make fight between Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory wearing leather make so boring???",Resident Evil - Retribution
125,markdroulston,Not for newcomers,3,12 September 2012,"Until this point, for all intents and purposes I hadn't seen any of Paul W.S. Anderson's Resident Evil films (I think I saw the first, but don't remember it at all. Were there scary dogs in it?). Entering into a franchise at the fifth installment is probably not the best strategy, but so it was that I found myself sitting down for Resident Evil: Retribution, not entirely sure what to expect. I played a few of the games as a teenager, but again, nothing has really stuck with me. So, how does the movie fare with (essentially) a newcomer such as myself?Not well. Not well at all.Thankfully (or so I thought), Anderson opens the film with a lengthy sequence bringing viewers up to speed with the story so far, and surprisingly it seems that the Resident Evil film series has all but evolved past being about zombies. There are a few sequences involving the undead in Retribution, but the real antagonist here is a malevolent artificial intelligence, the Red Queen, who controls the central computer system of the nefarious Umbrella Corporation.Early on the film is actually pretty fun, and shows potential. Our heroine Alice (Milla Jovovich) finds herself in an Umbrella testing facility, where the Red Queen runs simulations to see how the company's biological weapons affect various cities around the globe. Jovovich, perhaps the only thing holding this series together, fights her way through the Tokyo simulation, culminating in a highly entertaining hallway battle with a dozen zombies.Unfortunately, it's at this point that Anderson drops Alice into the real story, which I can only assume is continuing from the previous films, as I really didn't understand or care what was happening. As a stand-alone film, Retribution simply doesn't do enough for first-time viewers. What little structure the narrative has never really builds to anything, and it's more or less one long gunfight with an inexplicable rescue mission mixed in. Aside from Jovovich, the acting is atrocious across the board, with particularly shoddy work from Sienna Guillory and Bingbing Li. The performances, and Anderson's direction, are appropriately on par with that of a bad video game cut-scene, and get so bad at times that it almost seems intentional.Resident Evil: Retribution is not a film for new audiences but for die-hard followers of the franchise, although it's difficult to imagine even the most ardent fans finding much to enjoy here. Jovovich looks terrific and delivers the necessary butt-kicking, but that's really all there is to enjoy. Judging by the conclusion, the inevitable sixth film is probably going to be the last, although so little happens in Retribution that Anderson perhaps should have skipped this story all together and moved on the finish Alice's story sooner.Side note: I'm no fan of 3-D, but surprisingly Anderson seems to be unafraid to have fun with the format. Although the film suffers from some of the worst light-loss (one of the biggest arguments against 3-D) I can remember, Anderson grabs the gimmick with both hands and is clearly having a blast throwing bullets, axes, and gallons of blood at the audience. The native 3- D (not post-converted) actually makes a difference, and if you must see this movie, then shelling out the extra couple of bucks might be worth it.tinribs27.wordpress.com",Resident Evil - Retribution

But I like horror/slasher/zombie flicks and support the R.E. movie series because it doesn't pretend to be more than what it simply is--mindless indulgence.If the project had originally landed in the hands of Neil Marshall (Doomsday, The Descent), potential to kick ass and wow the audience would've been higher but I'm not complaining. Milla Jovovich has carried the role of genetically engineered Alice very well and Retribution returns to a familiar legacy. In its sixth installment; there is bad government, mad scientists, a reluctant heroine and her friends set in a post-apocalypse.The formula exists and over the years, Paul W. S. Anderson has responded to fans' expectations. I see faithful effort in every movie. There are more references to the original game this time in the vein of Ada Wong, Jill Valentine, Leon S. Kennedy and stylish fight choreography (look out for the scene where Alice battles zombies in Tokyo's simulation). Even the format progressively emulates the gaming experience, moving from one level to another. I get that the acting, script and plot can come away seeming mindless in appalling taste; but they are guilty pleasures and my views are skewed towards the positive.Only complaints are Albert Wesker's (Shawn Roberts) funny accent; the casting of Michelle Rodriguez as Rain Ocampo (I'm a fan and feel that the role failed to do her justice), the lazy execution of her demise and just maybe, not enough zombies.That said, there are many ""Oh man! *swoon*"" moments at Alice's corny one-liners.

Sure, even at the young age of 37, Milla Jovovich still has a ton of sex appeal but that only takes you so far. Retribution brings back some familiar faces including Michelle Rodriguez and Oded Fehr but their parts are wasted and pointless. With an overdose of CGI, explosions and mutated monsters, you wonder what's the point of it all? Yes, Retribution can draw parallels to a video game format where the protagonist has to make it through levels but....so what? Whats, the, point!?Paul W.S.

If they have the same plot, the films will become a 90-minute cosplay skit or a live-action playthrough! The film snobs keep calling this ""trash"" and ""terrible"", but let's see if they can generate over $900 million in box office revenue. This is now the fifth film in the franchise and Paul WS Anderson definitely knows what he's doing.Locations are more diverse than the predecessors. Alice finds herself in Los Angeles's seaside, Tokyo, New York, Moscow, an American suburb, Kamchatka, and Washington DC. The enemies are more and fiercer. The trailer boasts a very large Licker, which is so much better version against the 2002 monster. The 3D is maximized, unlike in Disney's ""Frozen"". The story runs smooth, though lacking in emotions at times. The action sequences are so better than Marvel's ""The Avengers"". Jump scares are present. Plot twists include location, characters' fates, and Umbrella's next moves, and they're all awesome. This is the ""Resident Evil"" film with the most stunts yet, making it high- octane.Gun reloading is an issue here. But other action movies are guilty of this flaw, so I tolerate the illogic. Milla Jovovich is an action star and her husband Anderson is an action movie director. Thus, ""Retribution"" is their best ""baby"" yet.

I never liked the first two Resident Evil's (maybe I need to re-watch them seeing it's been a while) but I really never took much notice of them until Apocalypse. That was a game changer and they keep improving. It doesn't matter the story has drifted away from the computer game. In Retribution, the plot kind of swings back to origins with Alice back inside the Umbrella corporation through circumstances set straight after the last film when she jumped off an exploding tanker into the ocean. Milla Jovovich should be enough reason to watch the grass grow if she was lying on it and she does not let any of the fans down here. Her kick ass attitude remains as does her armory. Michele Rodriguez also returns in not one but two roles and the concept is an interesting one. There is also a subplot of a Young deaf girl who Alice protects. Escaping through artificial cities such as Moscow and American Suburbia being pursued by zombies, monsters and foot soldiers makes it different. Must see as far as I'm concerned, the 3D is quite effective too.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Hopefully those guys will return in the next sequel if there is another one. Oh and it was also great to finally see Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) turning over to the good side as well although Jill did turn evil for a while.

Alice has been captured and taken to a secret facility, and with the help of some new, old and surprising allies, she must escape from the facility. Looking at the plot the film is quite simple in this addition to the series. But what makes the whole thing quite odd is the motivation for the Umbrella corporation still. As it says in the film they are still experimenting in how to control the T- virus. When you would think they would try to eradicate it by this point, as i imagine profits are dwindling. Also if it is about power with the post apocalyptic landscape if they successfully got rid of the zombies/monsters they would be the most powerful entity in the world still. As noted in the film quote Alice spends a lot of the film in a nice skin tight S & M style outfit, which reminds of something that did distract me, when Alice is in her cell. How comes Umbrella cannot afford a full gown for her to wear just essentially two pieces of paper connected by string. Then after a power cut suddenly the S & M outfits comes out the wall. WTF. what was it doing there?, is the Red Queen developing some odd tastes? or is the surprising ally still bad and they put it there? i don't know.I could go on ranting about this film, but the actors do what they can with the script. Also a lot of the action is predictable and boring. But there is some decent action set pieces in there to. In the end if you've seen the others in the series you may as well still see this one.

The next Resident Evil movie in that undead franchise could just be produced by cutting and gluing scenes from from it's predecessors. Paul W.S. Anderson is unstoppable as long there exist people who think they could make some money with this talentless hack and his wife. In this sense, truly the ""Evil goes global"".

136,champjohnson29,I'm a little disappointed...no I'm A lot disappointed,5,13 September 2012,"I was thrilled to receive an email confirming my RSVP for the red carpet premiere of the movie in LA tonight. Stood in line for three and a half hours just to make sure I got in since it was first come, first serve admission. I didn't mind though because I love Milla. She's been my favorite female action star since The Fifth Element. I was excited when the credits began to role but after about fifteen minutes into the movie, my inner critic said ""this is going to a bad movie"".Starting with the good, the costumes and the sets looked great. Alice (Jovovich) costumes have gotten better and better in every movie and this a no exception. The sets were great too. But of course, I love seeing people kick ass on film so once I saw guns, knives and fists flying, I was ready. Each fight scene was great, although, the slow motion got a little annoying. I wanted to actually see the fight in real time. Is that all? Yea I think that's it.I have played all the games. So I know what a great and engaging story the Resident Evil movies cane be, so I was excited to see a lot of the games main characters on the screen such as Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Barry. I was disappointed they hardly had any story. Once again, the movie is all about Alice. Even though, she was just a made up character she seems to be the focal point of the story and although I love Milla her acting was so robotic in this. Matter of fact, everyone's acting was robotic in this. Several people died and I could have cared less. There were a few lame attempts at emotional scenes, but all I found myself doing was checking my twitter updates and yawning a few times.The plot and story were very thin. I had a hard time figuring out what exactly was going on in the story. There were no stakes, no subplot. To sum up the entire movie, Alice gets captures by the Umbrella Corporation and Albert Wesker, decides to send a team in to rescue her even though he's been trying to kill her for the past three movies. I was kind of excited to see some character return (even though they died in the last movies) such as Michelle Rodriguez, Oded Fehr, Sienna Guillory and others, but I was anxious to find out how it is they are still alive. When it was revealed, I anted to scream because the idea was so stupid and corny. Also, where the hell was Chris, Claire and K-Mart. Three main characters just disappear and you bring on four new ones that you don't even bother to help us get to know. Paul W.S. Anderson really missed the mark with this one.I also though it was kind of offensive, that the first part of the movie was a montage of Milla Jovovich talking directly at the screen, telling the audience everything that has happened in the first four films.......as if we didn't know already. I was offended because it seemed like Paul W.S. Anderson just assumed that everyone who sees this film would be dumb and ignorant, but fortunately for us, a three year old could follow his mediocre screenplay.I feel like I'm rambling, but there were so many things wrong with this movie, that I can't pin point them all. And yes, of course the ending was a set up for a sixth installment but I thin everyone can agree that this franchise just needs to dismiss itself from our TV screens.Overall, the fight scenes were awesome. Michelle Rodriguez, Sienna Guillory, Li BingBing and Milla Jovovich all whooped some awesome ass in this movie, but the best part in the entire film was seeing characters Alice, Albert Wesker, Ada Wong, Jill Valentine and Leon Kennedy walk on top of the white house rooftop and stand in formation as if they were getting ready to battle. That's a bad ass team. All in all, if you're bored on a weekend night and want to see some fight scenes, go see this movie, But if you're tired of spending $18 on a movie and then realizing you wasted your money, just wait til it comes out on Redbox.",Resident Evil - Retribution
137,jojifrey,The RE sequel is getting better and better!,8,20 September 2012,"I looooove the opening scene. Very creative and very suitable for 3D shots!Jovovich as Alice is getting better and better.This is the best zombie movie that has been released for the past few years. (My other faves are Shaun of the Dead and Rec/Quarantine...don't even bother with Zombieland or Abraham Lincoln vs Zombies T__T)The action is fantastic, Alice is better than Black Widow and I love The Avengers movie that badly but I will still say it, yep... Milla Jovovich's actions are way above other female combatants in all genres.I also love Li Bingbing as Ada Wong --- she's like a character resurrected from the game directly, and she's so cute, ain't she!The story... well, I don't want to go there and bring up spoilers.. but, yeh, you can't expect Resident Evil to be like Christopher Nolan's movies... it is light, fun, and action packed, you can a bit compare it to Marvel's The Avengers.Yeah, but the true tips to enjoy this movie are:1. You gotta be a zombie movies fan.2. You gotta like Milla Jovovich that much.3. You gotta have a great sense of creativity.4. You gotta respect the characters in the game.5. You gotta love action movies.It is a pure joy movie, no need for high expectations. OK, maybe it is not worth watching in theatres if it is your dating night. You can either wait for it to be screened in HBO or wait until the DVD available in Civics or Blockbusters.",Resident Evil - Retribution
138,svr-2200,"Resident Evil Retribution is just a Time Pass film in Resident Evil Film Series, but nothing more.",6,26 September 2017,"Resident Evil Retribution: Movie Review. I enjoyed the film to a certain point. The movie has some major issues but at the same time its a fun time watching zombies getting kicked by Alice. Resident Evil Retribution is a visually spectacular, stunning, stylish film with amazing and awesome 3D effects and character design. The cinematography is fantastic and the fight sequences choreography is excellent. The locations and set pieces are dazzling and innovative. The performance of Milla Jovovich is good and strong.The major issue with the film is that the story is very weak and convoluted and characters are very underdeveloped. The sequences are very fast paced and are confusing and complicated. Some scenes are dull and boring. The movie lacks proper and smooth structure and the characterizations are heavily underutilized due to the weak script and unconvincing screenplay.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You).",Resident Evil - Retribution
139,nwsts,A 2 hour video game cut scene,5,13 September 2012,"Not sure if this movie is only for videogamers, but I can't see anyone else caring to sit through it. The movie made it quite clear, early on, that there would be no complicated plot lines or character development. And the dialogue was equally simplistic. The lines sounded something like this - go to the 3rd mountain and collect 20 coins and 3 golden power boosters. One quickly sensed this was not a movie at all, rather a simple video game cut scene. Also problematical were the incredibly goofy scenes with thousands of bullets aimed point blank at the heroes and all of them missing. It just takes all of the fun out of a movie when there is absolutely no sense of danger to the heroes.On the plus side, the action sequences were very well shot and the cgi was first class. That said, it just wasn't enough to make this reviewer glad to be sitting in the audience",Resident Evil - Retribution

141,Rebel_With_A_Cause_94,Another Pointless Sequel In An Already Mediocre Franchise,5,19 September 2012,"Let me start off this review by saying that i've never been a huge fan of the Resident Evil films. I hated the first one, the second one was so bad it was fun to watch, the third film was decent, and the fourth I actually had a fun time with. The main reason I watch these films are because I am a huge fan of the games and I always thought the action sequences were actually well done in these films. With each film in the series getting a little better, I figured that i'd give Retribution a shot in hopes that it would be similar to Afterlife with over-the-top action and amazing 3D effects.Unfortuantly, Resident Evil: Retribution is a step backwards in a franchise that was never that good to begin with and while it may not be the worst film in the franchise, it's easily the most pointless. First off, the tagline ""Evil Goes Global"" and trailers for the film are incredibly misleading. They presented the film as if it was going to be Alice and the rest of group traveling around the world fighting zombies and taking down Wesker. The film is actually about Alice and a team of survivors trying to escape an underwater located Umbrella Base while they go through simulations of locations around the world such as Tokyo and New York City. I couldn't help but feel ripped off by the end of the film as I expected something totally different and got something that just seemed rather lazy.Before I go anymore further into the negative aspects of the film though, I do want to mention some positive things about it. The action sequences in the film are once again really well filmed. While Paul W.S Anderson may not know how to direct a film as a whole, he knows how to shoot action. The action sequences in the first act are excellent and the climax scene had me on the edge of my seat. While I would say the film is non-stop action, the middle section of the film consist of generic shoot-em up scenes that are just not that entertaining or fun to watch. As a result, the film ends up feeling dull from this point up until the climax. On another positive note, the film is well paced and moves super fast so we never feel too tortured by even the dullest of scenes. It also provides a video game like feel to the film which is always a nice touch. Speaking of the video games, I have to admit it was pretty cool to see Leon in the film as he is my favorite character in the games.However, thats where the positives end for the most part. Back on the negative aspect, as I said before, there is almost no plot in the film and it's more of just a set up for a bunch of action sequences. I wouldn't have minded this as much if all of the action sequences were as equally entertaining instead of falling back on lame shoot-em-up scenes by the halfway point. I've also got to say that this film is incredibly stupid, and I mean stupid! I know that these are turn-your-brain-off action movies, but I just couldn't get over how incredibly stupid this movie was! Almost nothing made sense and the fact that Alice spends half of the movie trying to save a little girl that she finds in one of the simulations who serves no purpose what so ever and isn't even a real person. It was probably one of the worst plot devices i've ever seen in a movie and all the action sequences could've been set up just fine without her, in which would've resulted in a much less mind-numbingly stupid movie. Now i've never been into the story of this series, but the fact that this movie had none and did nothing to advance the progression of the already thin story in the previous films had me wishing they would've. While watching, it's hard to not feel as if Anderson and Jovovich have finally grown tired of this franchise (as they should've a long time ago). And while nobody goes into these films expecting good acting, it's worth mentioning that the acting here is by far the worst in the series. On a side note, one thing that also got me into the theater was the 3D effects. After Afterlife and it's amazing 3D, one would expect Retribution to at least be on par with it's 3D effects. Unfortuantley, the 3D here is rather mediocre. It doesn't add much depth to the film at all and while there are plenty of gimmicky moments, none of them pop out like they should. This lackluster 3D effects are most likely a result of Anderson switching to using Red Epic Cameras (a cheaper brand of 3D technology) instead of the Fusion Camera System that was used for Afterlife. This was most likely done for budget reasons, but at the expense of the 3D technology for the film.Even for fans of the franchise, Retribution is a hard film to recommend because it does nothing to advance the story that many of the fans enjoy and is nothing more than just 90 minutes of filler for a 6th film in the series. What saves it from being downright terrible are the action sequences. Judging by the ending, there's not doubt that a 6th film is on it's way. Lets just hope that the series ends there because Retribution is only more proof that this franchise should've have never gone as far as it has.",Resident Evil - Retribution
142,xodanielcasterox,No more!,2,18 September 2013,"Enough already! No more botched video game adaptions! Paul Anderson did a good job with Mortal Kombat. He at least understood the source material even though the blood and gore was excluded, it was still a fun movie. He did okay with the first Resident Evil even though none of the characters from the game were in the film until the sequels. But this has got to stop! We need a reboot fast! Here is a man who doesn't seem to give a sh!t anymore. The characters from the game like Leon Kennedy, Barry Burton and Ada Wong are completely useless in this movie. They're not interesting in this movie, they have little-to-no personalities, and they really need to recast Albert Wesker. There is no plot, the acting isn't all that impressive, and worst of all: NO CHRIS REDFEILD? Are you f*cking kidding me? Chris is the best of the Resident Evil video game franchise! Why would you do this? I'm glad Jill Valentine is in this, she too is very important to the franchise. The action isn't all that spectacular; it feels like cut-scenes from a video game. If I wanted to watch cut-scenes from a video game, I WOULD JUST PLAY A F*CKING VIDEO GAME! worst of all: ALICE! Everyone doesn't want to admit it because she is so sexy, but I will speak up for them. I played the games when I was a kid. Where is she? I can't find her. Oh wait...that's right, she's not in it! ALICE WAS NEVER IN THE GAMES, YOU F*CKING IDIOTS!!! Why do you need to create new characters? The characters in the games were awesome. Okay, I get she's banging the director but what does that have to do with the character Alice? Why couldn't she play Jill? This makes no sense. She has absolutely no business being in a game adaption she was never apart of to begin with. And I hate the fact that nothing seems to surprise her when things just so conveniently happen. Wesker died in the last film and now he returns with no explanation whatsoever. How does that not surprise her? Rain returns as a clone. You think it would shock her to see someone who's almost close to being her friend, but no. She's like ""You haven't changed a bit"" Wow! No plot and no dignity whatsoever. The games had more dignity than this horsesh!t And these creatures from the game are never given an explanation of what they are. The axe men, Las Plagas, Oroboros, J'avos. Never explained. The Licker was explained in the first flick, so what happened here? Oh, I almost forgot. The deaf little girl from Orphan is the only actress who's actually good here. And that's because she really is deaf. But hey at least she was trying! Which is more than I can say for this lazy plot-less senseless mess of a movie. We need a remake now! And this time the main characters better be Chris Redfeild and Jill Valentine with the mansion incident. If you're a hardcore Resident Evil fan like me, take my advice: stick the the games!I will say this: Ada Wong's voice is dubbed by Sally Cahill, the same voice actress who voiced Ada from RE 2 & 4. I thought that was king of clever. The real actress couldn't speak very good English.",Resident Evil - Retribution
143,nethlyn,Good 3D and a Great Tomandandy Soundtrack can't save it,4,2 February 2013,"It says it all that when I went to rent this film it was listed in Action and not horror - action is all you get, with none of the dread of even the first film, and that action's cut and pasted from Dawn of the Dead 2004, The World Is Not Enough, the older RE flicks, Aliens and The Terminator. The best thing about it was the music and the 3D which wasn't a conversion from 2D, but clearly stealing from Die Hard and a bunch of other movies for Afterlife was perceived to be a winning strategy and so that's what happened with Retribution.If the end scene is meant to be a setup for the 2014 film, which implies that's the end, then hopefully the boat will be pushed out and we'll get a two hour special. Sadly I'll be buying the soundtrack and won't be seeing this again until it's on television. Just happy I only rented it rather than spending cinema money.",Resident Evil - Retribution
144,jeddjong,This Resident Needs to Move Out,3,12 September 2012,"Video game movies have long had a bad rap, and one would be hard-pressed to name a flick based on a game that isn't terrible, let alone any good. When one thinks of the bottom of the cinematic barrel, video game movies are often lining the base, from Super Mario Bros. to Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li. The Resident Evil film franchise is by far the most successful among video game films. That is, however, not to say these are good films by any stretch. Unfortunately, Retribution is nothing but further evidence of that.The film opens promisingly enough, with an interesting-looking-if-indulgent action sequence shown in reverse, of an assault on a freight tanker ship that results in the capture of Alice (Jovovich). She awakes in a high-tech prison cell as a captive of the Umbrella Corporation from the previous films, and it's not long before her buddies come to break her out, characters such as Leon S Kennedy (Urb), Ada Wong (Li) and Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) numbering among them. Alice discovers her former ally Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) has been mind-controlled by the Umbrella Corp to turn against her, and unravels a conspiracy involving simulated arenas and mass cloning as she fights to preserve whatever's left of the human race.And then it's pretty much downhill from there, the film proceeding to rip off all manner of science-fiction/action films that have gone before, relying on cheap tricks and lazy writing to shove the 'story' along, and concluding with an outright shameless bit of sequel baiting. Whatever life this franchise may have once had has well and truly been replaced with a sense of the undead. It's rote, boring, and has an odd direct-to-video feel – at its worst, it gives off Uwe Boll vibes. We're serious. For the uninitiated, the film includes an exposition dump near the beginning, with Alice talking directly at the camera, summarising the events of the previous movies while clips from those films play in the background. While it does provide some setup for those new to the series, it's clunky, very on-the-nose, and just poorly-executed – setting the tone for what follows.The Resident Evil films have gained a degree of notoriety among fans of the video games because Alice, the protagonist of the movies, is nowhere to be found in the games that inspired them. This has led many to the conclusion that it's all an excuse for director Paul WS Anderson to show off his wife – and that he does once more in Retribution. It's cold comfort to see other characters actually from the source material appear in the film, but the focus is still solidly on Alice and her scenes are even more proof that she's nowhere as fun to watch as the others. Li Bingbing is so laughably stiff as Ada Wong that it's not just bad acting – it looks like a parody of bad acting. The Becky character played by partially-deaf child actress Aryana Engineer, ostensibly a surrogate child for Alice to grow attached to as the film progresses, seems like a shameless rip-off of the Newt-Ripley relationship in Aliens, and to resort to putting a child in jeopardy to get a reaction out of the audience is a cheap and ineffective tactic. Michelle Rodriguez seems to be having the most fun out of the cast, playing ""good"" and ""bad"" cloned versions of her character, but even then she is prone to histrionics.The film's tagline, ""Evil Goes Global"", is an utter misnomer. It is quickly revealed that the supposed globetrotting never takes place, and that locations such as New York, Tokyo and Moscow are merely simulated environments created by the Umbrella Corp to test their clones in – so it's more like ""Evil Goes Epcot Centre"". The action moves from each of these enclosures to the next, giving the film a video game-like structure of multiple levels – a structure that just doesn't work on the big screen. Our heroes run around level 1 killing zombies, then run around level 2 killing zombies, then have a car chase with zombies in level 3...it gets old really, really fast, and it almost seems as if the filmmakers actually intended to make audiences apathetic. There seem to be no emotional stakes, and while Alice and Co. get into jams fairly often, it won't be easy to actually care.All that said though, at least the 3D is employed effectively. There are several scenes where one can get a nice sense of depth looking down endless shafts and tunnels, and there is the occasional blade that flies out of the screen in quite convincing fashion. In a film like this one, it's perfectly fine for the 3D to be gimmicky; it's meant to be part of the fun. Ironically though, the good stereoscopic effects tend to expose the relatively weak CGI and visual effects work – you're looking down a tunnel, sure, but you can easily tell the tunnel is made of computer graphics.Ultimately, Resident Evil: Retribution is a very frustrating film to sit through. It's not so much egregiously bad as it is a very, very unnecessary sequel, and it appears that absolutely nobody involved in this project put in any effort, instead content to churn out another mediocre instalment in their sleep. Also, the story goes nowhere, the whole film essentially setting up for yet another sequel. If Paul WS Anderson and co. wish to continue making these films, they had better rethink their strategy, because if this fifth instalment achieves anything, it's in showing some sacred cash cows are probably better off slain.",Resident Evil - Retribution
145,BornKnight,Another Movie in the Series - Worth by the Action Scenes Only,6,12 December 2012,"""Resident Evil: Retribution"" is the 5th movie of the Resident Evil movies franchise - this time, the story is about Alice being captured by the Umbrella Corporation and held in a submarine installation in the Arctic, where they test bioweapons in various environments, and goes around her struggle to escape, aided by Wesker and a special team that goes to her rescue, while opposed by the Red Queen and Umbrella Soldiers.Basically this the story and that's it, and with some minor things it doesn't evolve much. The film more or less follows the same sequence of action of a video game, and follows the saga of heroin, leaving a (another) clear hook for another sequence.Visually, as always, the movie has a particular visual, and it's very well done, with very nice CG effects / creatures and makeup, and lots of action, which borders the impossible. The film uses contrast in a very dark tone this time.The music follows the action and fits perfectly, and the acting is good, within the general context.Overall I liked this version, for the general action and the effects - other than that, it's empty, especially the story and character development that is superficial. But generally, the action is what we expect from Resident Evil movie in the end, not something epic worthy of the best action film together (like every other RE movie was after all). Get it if you like the other RE movies, and like action video-games in general.",Resident Evil - Retribution
146,mwburrows,A stunt reel with suggestively dressed women.,1,15 September 2012,"Personally, I think films that elicit a response from the audience are the best kind - sadness, frustration, grief, excitement and debate following a viewing indicate you have watched a well-made film. Resident Evil: Retribution produces none of the above. It is flat, dry, boring, poorly written, directed and produced by a director who has already established a reputation for incompetence. Quite why the studio has once again handed the reins to someone who has run the franchise into the ground with one critical failure after another is beyond me. There is no charisma or flair, the ""plot"" clutches at straws and makes no attempt to provide a meaningful or thrilling story. The wafer-thin plot exists so Paul can get to work making more drab action scenes that are about as exciting as watching Driving Miss Daisy. Most set pieces involve the good guys forming a skirmish line and blazing away at the bad guys who charge into the hail of lead without hesitation and are subsequently mowed down. This happens for about three minutes, and there also some explosions and CGI effects. That's about it. Nothing to get your pulse racing, nothing to get you biting your nails, just a cast of models and typecast actors wearing grimaces for an hour while they shoot stuff and recite the most laboured dialogue ever written for the screen. Eye-candy abounds for both sexes and is perhaps the only reason why a grown adult with a functioning brain would sit through the film. Watching Milla and Sienna in neoprene body-suits and Li Bingbing in a red dress is the only engaging photography in the entire tedious one and a half hours of stunts and explosions. Roles seem to be phoned in and nobody looks particularly excited about another Resident Evil film working with Paul ""Destroyer of Films"" WS Anderson.

148,XxBabyKillerxX,Loved it!,9,14 September 2012,I just got out of the theater and I am so happy about this movie. I have been waiting since Afterlife for this and they did a fantastic job on Resident Evil: Retribution! This might not make sense to people who didn't start by playing the games as they brought characters from the video game series which I also loved. If you played the video games this will be a lot of fun for you. If not you will still love the story of it. The visual effects were absolutely amazing and looked beautiful. The sound effects were exactly the same and made the movie that much better. Milla Jovovich is back as Alice and is still as great as the first Resident Evils. This movie was done perfectly and I loved that it was more involved with the Video Game series yet still part of the movie. I will be going to see this again for sure before it is out of theaters.I give Resident Evil: Retribution a 9 out of 10.GO SEE THIS MOVIE.~Joe,Resident Evil - Retribution

150,edenney01,Garbage,4,22 December 2012,"This movie was made for 2 reasons and 2 reasons only... to squeeze a few more dollars out of a very tired franchise, and to cash in on the ridiculous 3D craze that's been inexplicably sweeping globe. Few things annoy me more than scenes that are in a movie for the sole purpose of showing off a 3D effect, and this movie is chock full of them (a distant second to The Harold & Kumar Christmas movie however, which was shot almost entirely for the purpose of dazzling the audience with pointless 3D effects).The movie was almost entirely devoid of a script or plot, the writing was amateurish, and the acting matched the writing. There's no emotional investment in whether a character lives or dies anymore, because at this point in the franchise characters can be resurrected and interchangeably turned into a good or bad guy, or in some cases the characters can't die at all. You don't have to worry about zombies infecting people, because now there are cures for the T-Cell virus as we saw from the previous movie, and they can simply re-infect people when they want.If you're a die hard Res Evil fan you probably don't care about any of that and will enjoy the movie, but if, like me, you enjoyed the first movie but felt that they've just been getting worse and worse with each successive sequel, then I suggest you spend your time doing or watching almost anything else. The good news is that this short 95 minute movie is actually only 84 minutes long, with an almost record setting 11 minutes of credits. Amazing for a movie that only has about a dozen roles with any spoken lines. Probably 10 of those 11 minutes are dedicated to those responsible for the special effects and CGI. My suggestion is to skip to the last minute or so of the movie, which just sets up the next crappy sequel, since it's probably the best scene of the entire flick (and that isn't saying much).",Resident Evil - Retribution

If I watched it in the cinemas, you can be sure that I'd have walked out after 10 minutes to get my money back. It is that bad. You don't have to watch much to know how excruciatingly horrible this movie is. I can't believe how they even got the money to produce it or who was stupid enough to blindly put money into this. Milla Jovovich is at her worst but this is only normal. At first I thought she lost weight but it was just the long hair. With the tom-boy hair, she looks fatter. Her acting is not up to scratch at all, actually you can plot a graph of her gradual worsening from the 1st movie to this one (rock bottom). Most of the action scenes make no sense and produce the yawnies. I'm not going to elaborate. Stay away from this pile of fecal matter.

152,nickkulstadis,"Another DOA by Paul Anderson with ""Resident Evil "" slapped onto the title",1,8 July 2021,"Man was this a bad movie! It did have probably the most entertaining action scenes of all the RE movies and some amusing lines and situations but it fails to give any reason for you to watch it with it's completely pointless and improbable plot. It has enough plot for 10-15 minutes but it runs for almost 1 hour and 40 minutes, meaning it grows tedious very quick. This may have been easier to overlook if they cast a better lead actor with enough screen presence, charm and charisma to play the role like Halle Berry, Asia Argento or Carrie Ann-Moss. But instead, again it's Milla Jovovich and her awful wooden acting and lack of screen presence and charisma. She should've been a side character but of course she had to be the main star because she's Paul Anderson's wife. She's definitely the worst part of the movies, as she grates on your patience fairly quick for aforementioned reasons. In any half decent director took on the project, she would've either been a side character or not cast at all.Anyway, the other thing that lets this movie down, other than having zero to do with the games other than a couple elements and characters, is the plot. It boils down to""Alice is captured on the Arcadia from Apocalypse and is brought to Umbrella's underwater training facility under the former USSR submarine pens. She must escape with the help of Albert Wesker, Ada Wong and some other familiar game characters. They shoot their way through and along the way they discover clones used to run simulations of the T Virus ravaging certain cities to sell to the countries enemies to use it against the country who had a simulation ran. IE China would use it against Japan, The US against Russia, North Korea against South Korea and vice versa. After meandering around the different cities, the remaining group escapes and they are greeted by Jill who has been controlled with one of those scarab things from Resident Evil 5 by the Umbrella Corp. The group fight her and also evil Rain and the group wins although they lose Luther. They are then shown at the White House greeted by Albert Wesker who then returns Alice's powers back to her. As if that made any difference. They then view the war between humans and monsters on the top of the WH. End of movie)
The plot is awful and renders the whole experience pointless. It barely works as a guilty pleasure because Milla Jovovich is a charisma black hole who is a detriment to every scene she's in. Casting a better main lead would've helped alleviate this problem. There are some relatively plot light, action heavy flicks that are helped by casting either the right main lead(Daniel Craig, Sean Connery) or they hire a really solid cast for the secondary leads(Carrie Ann-Moss And Lawrence Fishburne) to compensate for a less skilled main actor. This film features neither. Even the best of the secondary main leads like the actor that plays Luther West or Oded Fehr can't save this movie. Everyone is almost as bad as Milla. Although it could also be the poor script to blame as that is usually the cause of bad acting or it's possibly the bad direction by Paul Anderson.Just skip this movie and watch a better action movie like The Matrix or the Daniel Craig 007 movies or watch a better horror film like 28 Days Later or Dawn Of The Dead. These horror films have action and it's done far better and it works with the storyline rather than serving as filler for a weak script. For a more horror oriented approach, try The Grudge or The Shining. Far better than this movie or any of the other Anderson RE movies.",Resident Evil - Retribution
153,kat_777,Just like a video game..,4,6 October 2012,"I have always enjoyed the Resident evil franchise. The first one had a bad ending but was definitely re watchable. The second and third movie had nothing but lot of action and running. Fourth movie, that is the resident evil Afterlife was very good. It had action, suspense, good direction and better involvement of the co characters. Above all Tomandandy did an excellent job on the background scores. Ever since i saw the afterlife i was desperately waiting for the next chapter.I saw it just three days after the it released near where i live. The theater had very less people, surprisingly for a 3d movie. When i saw the whole film i realized that it didn't stick up to all the expectations we had. The whole movie was like a video game, it hardly had any plot. It was all about Alice finding herself trapped in a secret experimenting area and her desperate attempt to escape with new subordinates Ada Wong and a young girl named Becky.The direction was not up to the mark. I found out so many plot holes here and there which made it little less impressive. That includes Rain being shown as an evil character. Rain Ocampo played by Michelle Rodriguez was one my most favorite character introduced in the first Resident evil movie. She died eventually in it and then she was cloned in the fifth film as an evil character. The final scene where she fights the two men and sheds bullets looked really stupid. That is where the direction failed. Sienna Guillory was terrible. She just can't shown any great emotions on her face. I just can't understand why everybody likes her so much. Her face is just like a doll. Oded Fehr was just a waste of time in the whole thing. I totally despised the way Ada Wong (Li Bingbing) was shown. She was introduced as a slick and manipulative action heroine who always had a plan. Then later on it was shown that her life was under the mercy of the villains. That was seriously a drawback.Milla Jovovich managed to stick to the core presentation of the character Alice but even she escaped most of the time especially at the end solely out of luck.The fight scenes completely lost the original standard and looked artificial, all the flipping and jumping was just like the characters in the games. The visual effects was good, but they didn't have the punch. The background also didn't have the punch all the other resident movies (afterlife) did.The whole movie was a waste of time and the characters and the story was ruined in a way. But if Paul WS Anderson is really planning to make a sequel then I hope he does something to make the whole franchise to look a little convincing.4/10",Resident Evil - Retribution

Wait for it on TV, then watch the news!",1,15 January 2013,"I love the series, all have been entertaining and worth watching, even twice for some of them when repeated on TV, but this has no story, poor script and the acting is rank amateurish. What were the producers thinking, other than fleece the public one last time. I hope this review saves a few people from wasting there money....Don't see this, it's a sort of film of a video game, and not very well done even for that....Don't waste your time on this. Cgi I've read was amazing, I didn't think so, and the gun play and fight scenes seemed illogical and stupid. The enemies fired relentlessly and missed, but the good guys fire a few times and kill dozens?",Resident Evil - Retribution
155,Vlad_the_Reviewer,Cheaply Milking the Cow,4,30 November 2012,"Retribution is the fourth installment of the Resident Evil saga. It's a zombie movie. A woman fights zombies and takes it up with Umbrella, an evil corporation.The move doesn't have much going for it, despite some decent effects. Scenery was mediocre. There wasn't a budget for a decent writer though. I won't spoil it but the story-line is comparable with any b-movie.I could more or less defend the storyline of previous episodes, but this last installment is just horrible. It has new outrageous monsters, but are engineered without much fantasy. Heck, the actresses couldn't even carry their guns. Their hands and arms were shaking in an effort to keep these things aimed properly. Really annoying for a person who pays attention to detail. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it.Sienna Guillory plays the character of Jill Valentine once again. In her First incarnation she was a good cop with short dark hair and dressed like Lara Croft. In this movie she was the evil chick with long blond hair, wearing a way too tight jumpsuit with too much cleavage accompanied with an endless stream of bad acting. In the end Jill and our protagonist duked it out. Wasn't worth it. So the camera perfectly presented Jill's cleavage at the same time. Needless sexualization is a mandatory thing in Hollywood, I get it, but I don't accept this excuse. Also Michelle Rodriquez is part of the scene again. She did what she does in almost all of her movies: her small share. Not noteworthy this time, although I realize she has her own fan-base. I like seeing her too.And finally, our heroin had some help from some old friends: Luther and his gang. Man did they act bad.It looks like only Mila and Michelle tried their best. What the heck was the rest doing? I have no reason to dislike any of the actors or their roles. So that's not it. I wish I could have been more enthusiastic. Their acting was plain and simple far below par.I love the Resident Evil franchise. I was looking forward to see Retribution because I didn't think they were going to make it worse than the previous episode. I was wrong. There was no heart in this movie. I can live with the ending, though it's not a great one; A cliffhanger promising an epic next installment. Don't count on it. My score: 4/10. I feel this is a straight-to-DVD release.",Resident Evil - Retribution
156,Ghost33,I swear... they aren't even trying anymore.,3,9 December 2012,"Without any type of budget or previously awesome monster models.. this movie would be complete and utter crap. The plot is so muddled and stupid that you'll be rolling your eyes the entire film in disgust. The creators of this series no longer care about releasing a good story, it's all about money now.If you are a fan of the resident evil series.. which I certainly must question how any one can be anymore... don't even bother with this one. The return of previous cast members means absolutely nothing, and in fact you begin to hate them as the mere notion that this film has any connection to previous resident evil movies is enough to drive you to the brink of insanity.Pathetic. Stupid. Never again.",Resident Evil - Retribution
157,jayce2279,I enjoyed the first 4 movies but this pretty much killed the franchise,1,5 February 2013,"Although the Resident Evil movies have always been somewhat disappointing compared to the video games they're based on, I still rather enjoyed watching the first three instalments and, once I made it through the obligatory Kung Fu scene of Afterlife, even that wasn't too bad. So I was really looking forward to Michelle Rodriguez's return in Retribution but, sadly, I was in for a major disappointment. Whereas the first four movies still had something resembling of a story to tie all of the action sense together, it seems like in this one the makers just got together to brainstorm ideas for their new movie but since they couldn't come up with anything good, they just shot every single idea they did come up with, edited them all together and called it a movie. The result is so messy it's hard to believe it was directed by the same man who made Soldier and Event Horizon. In my opinion, as much as the makers of The Walking Dead got the Zombie genre just right, that's how badly Paul W.S. Anderson missed the ball with Resident Evil: Retribution. The ending does leave an interesting opening for a 6th and hopefully final instalment but it's going to be tough to make up for this one.",Resident Evil - Retribution
158,bhaveshbhatia,Good action flick but you'll wish there was a better plot!,8,14 September 2012,"Milla Jovovich butt-kicks her way into the undead territory in Resident Evil: Retribution, the fifth video game-based zombie catastrophe movie in the franchise.Milla Jovovich moves from her usual skin-tight leathers and ugly buckle wear, and dons a jeans, with blond hair and a sweet cute little girl. One does not have to wait long for evil to strike, sending property sale values plunging as zombies run riot around the city smashing brains and looking for blood. How that happens, along with the rest of the messed up plot, doesn't really matter. Resident Evil was not always known for its story as much as it was known for its action-packed thrill-to-kill sequences. And the 5th edition does not disappoint. The flaws in the movie are covered up by narratives. It's the same blood curdling carnage as the first four movies, with 3D effects spilling blood, blades and body parts into the audience amidst a non-stop bombardment of gunfire and explosions. Once again, determined Alice stands against the evil with whips and huge rifles from a backpack holster and takes out monsters, drooling zombies and bad guys employed by the ugly Umbrella Corporation. The deadly virus Umbrella designed for biological warfare is still out in the open and is now being tested on overseas population worldwide. Alice ends up globe trotting along with new side-kick Ada Wong (Bingbing Li). Fight scenes are thrown very generously throughout the movie. Slow- motion digital graphics make bullets dance while Alice literally flies, jumping from one victim to the next with her guns blazing and using their bodies as if they were pommel horses. Alice is helped by a few good men, some of whom she knows from earlier movies. A computer called the Red Queen, designed not to take no for an answer, make life difficult for the little band of fighters. Writer-director Paul W.S. Anderson was not content to stick with drooling zombies and fountains of blood and he takes the movie a level higher with x-rays that show bones getting crushed and hearts getting ripped off from the arteries as one gets hit. The special effects are imposing but they tend to become a pain to the eye after some time, making Resident Evil:Retribution a movie shot on a stage with a bloody digital world created around it as a backdrop. When we last see Alice, she is standing on the roof of the White House with her gang while D.C. is ravaged by winged zombies. Prelude to a sequel? Let's wait and watch!",Resident Evil - Retribution

160,fortionat1,Not even an attempt to be a movie.. just watching a video game,1,4 January 2013,"I know these Resident Evil movies are originally based on a video game, but at least the last one, Resident Evil Afterlife[2010] was a decent movie that plotted out with a good screenplay and moved more like a movie than a video game. But this one is just ridiculous. You know when you get a new game now, usually they have a nice intro or short movie to get the game going, then you play. Well this movie is like that game movie and play the entire time. Its like watching someone else play a fairly boring loud bang bang shoot shoot gory monster video game for 90 minutes (seemed like 2 hours). Seriously they just walk through this video game going from one set to the next trying to beat the next level.Its difficult to believe even the die-hard Resident Evil fans would like watching this formulaic movie. I would have to assume this is just one big ad for the next Resident Evil video game installment. Wont be on any of my game consoles or PC. Resident Evil out.",Resident Evil - Retribution
161,sonicfan5715,5th Resident Evil film... not too bad,8,4 January 2013,"I would like to point out that these films (based on the hit video-game series) have been made for basically showing us zombies, lickers, and a variety of bad ass undead getting their asses handed to them by a smoking-hot Milla Jovovich in tight black spandex or skimpy dresses... And that's why we love them! But the major complaint about these films are the confusing story lines and such, people go in to see a movie like this and wonder wtf is going on (unless you've actually seen the first 4 films). As for Resident Evil: Retribution... I liked it, I probably liked it almost as much as Afterlife, probably my favorite in this series. It is very confusing at first, even for a follower of the films like myself, but it eventually comes together and you understand very quickly what was going on. And (I don't want to give away any of the awesome action scenes here) after they fight through everything in the film, they eventually join an old enemy, and clearly states without a doubt that there will be one more, possibly final film, with the humans taking their last stand against the mutant undead. (I am hyped!) It's actually nostalgic watching this film because it brings in a couple of old faces from the first three films, but it's for a reason that'd you'd have to watch the movie to understand. And we finally get Leon, from the games, into the movies, and it's great to see him. I'm actually not sure who plays him as I'm typing this, but he looked fine enough as Leon, and surprisingly had the hairstyle down too. Now the action and undead/mutants... fantastic, some of the best the franchise has to offer. We get a giant, mutant licker (harkening back to the original with a licker hunting them down), soviet Russian zombies that can actually shoot guns and ride motorcycles, a showdown with not one, but TWO Axemen, and one sexy cat fight scene (you'll see what I mean at the end of the movie.) Visual effects were very impressive, I would have liked to see this in theaters in 3D, especially the genius beginning credits when everything was playing backwards. All in all, 8 out of 10, just because the action was so damn awesome, but people get thoroughly confused during the storyline, and that kind of brings down the experience, but not by much. Very fun, and awesome movie if you're just looking to see undead becoming, well, dead!",Resident Evil - Retribution
162,VideoEmbolism,"The quintessential action movie - Silly, violent, colorful and insane in that way that only Resident Evil movies can be",10,27 March 2014,"Not exactly awe-inspiring but still definitely watchable none the less the fifth installment of the Resident Evil series manages to be completely loopy and yet still utterly predictable at the same time all because like the zombies in it the story just WILL NOT DIE! More clones of Alice, more alternate realities, more insane bad guys who seem to have no purpose other than to be insane and do insane things, and more completely random pointless conspiracies titillate this entry with their hi-tech big-budget charm and complete lack of insight, creativity or intelligence making it the equivalent of PCP-laced tooth-rotting cinematic candy for your mind when nothing else will hit the spot. The more the filmmakers shoot this series in the head the more it becomes obvious how life without brain matter is possible especially for Hollywood producers and the audience that pirate their movies on the internet.

But you're watching this during 1.5 hours.During first 15 minutes of the movie I had only one thought in my mind: ""what a hell is this?""There is no plot, no catchy story like in previous parts. Here you have several blocks and a lot of stupid shooting and fighting without a hint to be a bit realistic. The final fight is like a raping of your mind - too much FX's, too less reality and common sense, it's against everything good in the world.Actors are great. After a deadly injury a character doesn't show any sight of the pain except in his words.Dialogs in the movie are fantastic If you'll write down all the lines of all characters, you'll hardly fill 1.5 pages A4 size.Watching this movie a felt like I'm fooled - creators didn't want to work to make it interesting, they used CGI+FX+fighting+shooting without everything else that makes movie worthwhile, and sold it to me using a bright wrap.People were leaving the movie theatre in the middle of this picture.Hope next movie will be much better.",Resident Evil - Retribution

But one thing I think they should improve is the storyline. It was so 'game', which the story exactly remake the first Resident Evil chronology. It was okay, but somehow we need something more than just the same storyline and actions for a few episodes now.

The opening scene of this one was a more fleshed-out version of the scene where Umbrella osprey-looking ships come to the ""Arcadia"" (only difference now, is it shows Alice and the gang ATTEMPT to fight them off.Then, Alice wakes up back in Raccoon city and dies trying to escape. You find out there are still Alice clones and places like Raccoon City (2'nd movie), Tokyo (4'th movie) and the Mansion (1'st movie) are all simulations. These simulations, and clones make it really hard to tell what's real and what isn't throughout the course of the movie. All in all it just comes across as really confusing. I'd say it was a better story than the previous movie, just executed poorly (hence the .25 better score).The end of the movie pretty much makes sense; solid enough to not make more if it bombs too bad, but open enough for a sequel if possible (which luckily there was...and it was AMAZING!)

Movie gold...Right?Well, somewhere along the road they lost their way, and this movie unfortunately demonstrates this even more so than the others!The narrative of this story is so confusing, the characters (including long dead ones) pop up all over the place with no real explanation and the acting is average at best! The inclusion of the 'child in peril' is also completely pointless! The Zombies are a rare sight in this instalment too which i found a great disappointment, and are replaced by poor CGI Lickers and other 'arena constructs' (Hunger Games anyone??)Personally I think this is the weakest of the series, it's only redeeming feature is that it has some great action sequences which are shot brilliantly. The reverse shots as the film opens are stunning. And Milla Jovovich is on top Ass Kicking form!If you've seen the rest of the films, this one is worth a look, but if you are new to them, then I wouldn't bother, you will be left wondering ""WTF is happening""!",Resident Evil - Retribution

I was looking forward to seeing Retribution as I knew it continued straight where the last film left off.The last few films have been really enjoyable but after each film the forums are full of people voicing their own opinions to how the film should be more like the game. When will people realise films fully based on games are terrible! This film looks like the Director has unfortunately listened to the fans and made this film to be a game with level and lives which I feel ruined the film and seems to be any old excuse to get actors the director has worked with in the past back in the film even if they were previously killed off!The opening sequence was good and I settled into the film but then it takes the route of computer game and the film takes a dive from here.There is no tension in the fight scenes.I hope they make another Resi Evil so they can fix everything that is wrong in this film.",Resident Evil - Retribution
168,stuartkpark,Where are the dogs?,7,30 September 2012,"The film starts with the end of the fourth movie being played backwards in slow-motion, then forward at normal speed. This kills about five minutes of viewing time and is a very lazy way to do a recap. Was it necessary? No, not really, maybe Paul W. S. Anderson spent so much on that scene last time he thought he'd get his money's worth by using it again. After this we see snippets from each of the other four films in a Minority Report (iPad) style narration by Milla, so ten minutes in and the film hadn't actually started.If you've seen any of the other films then you'll know what to expect, If not, you're not really missing out on anything. That's not to say they are not enjoyable, if you want a safe, solid, completely OTT sci-fi action flick with big explosions, big guns, big monsters, rugged heroes, slinky girls, evil baddies, mean stares, furrowed brows, muscles and grunting, this is it.In each film they try and explain some pointless plot, this is laughable as the plot is not the reason to watch these films (see the points above). If there was less plot there would be less holes and less reasons to fail each time. If I wanted plot I'd watch something with 'actors' and 'dialogue' (meow!).This is one of the better ones in the series, when the film does start we have an almost identical shot-by-shot re-enactment of the Dawn Of The Dead remake (which I liked, since I liked the DOTD remake). We have Milla playing Ripley from Aliens, giving her some kind of emotional connection and purpose. Also, this is a 3D film where I actually noticed the 3D in some places, second only to Avatar (OK and maybe some bits of Tron, but I'm trying to erase Tron from my memory).If you're looking to lose yourself for a couple of hours and come out unscarred, this could be it.*** Rant *** Spoilers *** Rant *** Spoilers *** Rant *** Spoilers *** I tried to ignore the 'plot' but they made a point of it... So, the Umbrella Corporation have a massive undersea facility where they can replicate major city centres from around the world. They replicate Times Square and show the outbreak to sell their virus to the Russians, they replicate an outbreak in Moscow and sell the virus to the Americans. They fill these city centres with human clones and give them some memories to make them care about stuff. If the Umbrella Corporation has the ability to create a Holodeck type environment on a large scale AND have the ability to create fully functioning human clones wouldn't they have a market to sell this technology to the world instead of some virus to kill everyone? We learn in the third one (which is essentially Mad Max followed by Day Of The Dead) that most of the worlds population has been wiped out by the virus outbreak in the first film. So who are they actually selling the virus to? I guess we have some evil corporation being evil for the sake of it.Also, no undead mutant dogs - disappointed!",Resident Evil - Retribution
169,m-a-elsewhere,Should be titled Resident Evil: Boss Battles,6,3 February 2013,"PREMISE: Alice. Kills stuff. PLOT: Alice. Kills stuff. Viewers hoping for a coherent narrative are advised to try Capcom's Resident Evil cartoons; viewers completely new to the series really have no choice but to let the images simply break over them like tsunamis. Despite 2 or 3 pages of exposition, series writer/director Paul W. S. Anderson clearly assumes that anyone rejoining him at this point is so familiar with both the movies and the various R.E./BIOHAZARD VGs that new characters (Ada Wong; Leon Kennedy) can be ported over from the games, and old characters (Rain; Carlos) resurrected without explanation (Jill Valentine, Albert Wesker and Luther West are back; Claire and Chris Redfield make cameos). Happily, I AM that geekish, so enjoyed the merry-go-round. The CGI FX, which are virtually non-stop, are more varied, energetic, and original than in previous sequels. No more mutant dead dogs, thank goodness, although Anderson remains overly-fond of his tentacles- bursting-out-of-the-mouth shots.The movie is less a script than a series of levels, as Alice, Project Alice, Leon, Ada and their ad hoc teams are dragged through artificial environments adapted from previous installments, from games (notably the new Manhattan and Moscow sets), from any spin-off that isn't bolted to the ground, even from absolutely unconnected franchises (e.g. DAWN OF THE DEAD). Each setting—all controlled by The Red Queen--has its own horde of character clones infected with different strains of the T-Virus and/or Plaga Parasite and its own boss monster adapted from one or another of the games. If...and only if...that paragraph made the least bit of sense, then this movie's recommended.",Resident Evil - Retribution
170,rachel-673-19946,The zombie apocalypse just got boring.,3,27 September 2012,"You go into a RESIDENT EVIL film thinking you know exactly what you're getting. A statuesque beauty kicking undead ass while attempting to uncover an overarching corporate/government conspiracy, and also while saving the lives of assorted, improbably well-coiffed, survivors of the zombie apocalypse. There'll be impressive feats of insane bravery, a whole bunch of wire work, slow motion replays of previous events, assorted sidekick types lost and found, the occasional fright provided by the lurking legions of the undead, and lots and lots of gunfire, all scored to a calculatedly pounding baseline you can feel all the way to your spine.You're not expecting high art, not for a second. But neither are you, I would hazard a guess, expecting to be bored.From the outset of this, the fifth in the franchise, that was my predominant emotion. Oh, I jumped a little every now and then at the advance of a particularly heinous zombie horde, I was able to call forth at least a modicum of appreciation for the continuing splendor of the action sequences, and there was more than a little perplexity in there as well as the tale got ever more convoluted, but almost from the moment our heroine, Alice (Milla Jovovich) began her usual deadpan recounting of previous events, her ""My name is Alice, and I'm about to exposition the hell out of you people"" straight-to-camera Story So Far, it was all I could do to muster any interest in proceedings.This is a shame, as there is not a single other entry in the series that I didn't, at least on some level, enjoy. Perhaps my major problem with this movie is that it is by far the most video game-esque of all of the series thus far, and since I have never played the game, I don't really understand these scenes' appeal. Director Paul W. S. Anderson has dispensed with even the semblance of plot now, and instead is relying on the thrill of vicarious levelling up to appease moviegoers. Oh, there has always been an element of this in the movies, as is only right and proper; one should never ignore one's roots, and not throwing in the occasional sop to the gamers in the form of a subtle reference to one of the more beloved design elements would be not only disrespectful but foolish. But there is subtle homage and then there is outright cinematic LARPing; Jovovich and co. basically spend the majority of the movie as live-action Player 1, working their way through level after level, all the while shooting almost indiscriminately and surely taking hits that should have killed, or at least inconvenienced, them in all of the chaos. I swear, I saw the guy beside me in the theater flick his fingers in what looked very like someone mastering a PlayStation controller, his sense memory clearly telling him that for all of this stylized, almost ritualistic carnage to be erupting on screen in front of him then surely he should be X-Y-bumper-right-left-ing to make it happen.The premise is this: picking up directly from where the last movie left off – and yet, not entirely – Alice is captured by the ruthless Umbrella Corporation and is due for extermination by the rogue company artificial intelligence, the Red Queen. She experiences a memory, or perhaps an hallucination, where she was married to Oded Fehr and had a hearing impaired daughter before the zombies took over the world, and when she awakens in her cell, it takes her a moment to recapture her badass. Capital-E EVIL corporate lackey Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) frees her from her cage for inscrutable reasons (he tries to explain, but his stentorian, Agent-Smith-""Mr. Anderson""-style delivery of his every line makes it hard to focus), and then Alice and her wooden, if dexterous, new helpmeet Ada (Li Bingbing) must battle their way through the Umbrella complex, defeating the antagonists in each new room – and, of course, the hard-to-kill Big Boss – before moving on in an attempt to escape. Oh, there are other people involved here, too; some from previous movies in the franchise, some new faces, but the main objective is just to kill as many extras as possible, be they zombie or Umbrella minion or clone.I may be making it sound more interesting than it actually is.Then there are the performances. Milla Jovovich does her valiant best, but this is a hard plot to rise above, and it is really only when she is sharing the screen with the most abysmal of actors – and there are many – that she truly shines, if only by comparison. Michelle Rodriguez, who is way too good for this, is fine, considering the few scenes and limited dialogue she has to work with, and Oded Fehr, whom we see in this one for barely a second, is WAY too good for this, and must have really needed the paycheck -- but then, he was way too good for APOCALYPSE and EXTINCTION, and they were exponentially better films.Most of the remainder of the speaking cast – excepting the aforementioned Roberts and Bingbing – are fairly inoffensive, and Boris Kodjoe always brings the pretty, but Sienna Guillory as friend-turned- Umbrella-puppet Jill is truly terrible, going for possessed-by- malevolent-artificial-intelligence but achieving only petulant, I-was- rejected-from-THE HILLS screechiness.The movie ends on a cliffhanger (as has become the norm in this franchise), and for the first time I just don't care at all what happens next. So perhaps I should be happy, now cured of one of my more pointless enthusiasms of recent years. And should a sixth movie in this series be made, as seems unhappily likely, here's hoping the zombies win.– Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine",Resident Evil - Retribution
171,dreamflix,Alice is Reincarnated in Retribution,6,15 September 2012,"A lot of energy went into the special effects on this one. The Umbrella Corporation has spread across the globe and Alice is the only one who can save humankind. The fight scenes are great, as Alice (Jovovich) delivers with various sorts of attacks: hand-to-hand, guns, explosives, knives and even cars. The opening scene starts with the action going backwards so you get to see where things left off in the last film, Afterlife. Various old characters come and go in this one. Jill (Sienna Guillroy) returns as the ultimate pursuer of Alice. Their fight scene is good, as they battle with various weapons, along with pounding on each other relentlessly. Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) comes back as two characters: mild mannered and kinda clueless, and then beefed up and unstoppable. Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) comes across less as a warrior, but the red dress is a good contrast to the new get up that Alice wears in this one. Alice is a thinking fighter. The guys are also well beefed. It always fun to watch Kevin Durand, as he plays so many types of characters. From the lovable, bone crushing hybrid in Dark Angel, to the blond mutant Fred in Wolverine. As Barry, he stokes on a cigar as he goes down fighting. Oded Fehr returns as Alice's husband, then pursuer. Alice is finding that her memories have been manipulated by the umbrella corporation. Leon is back, but this time wants Alice to help save the world from the undead that the Umbrella Corporation has spread across the globe. Leon has sent a small crew into the Umbrella Corporation to get Alice, one of which is Luther (Boris Kodjoe), who sticks by Alice until the end. The storyline on this one could have been stronger. Afterlife was actually better on the character development. This one didn't provide the depth that was needed on the characters. Another disappointment is when Ada Wong tells Alice that she has to traverse through three training grounds created by the Umbrella Corporation in order for her to catch up with her rescue crew. At that point, you're hoping that she zips through them and then the real (and unpredictable) story line is revealed. But when you find out that now you have about an hour to watch her go through them, you're disappointed because now you know what she has to do and have a sense of what is going to happen next. The introduction of Becky (Aryana Engineer) from Orphan is a bit familiar if you watched Kate Beckinsale's Underworld this year. That also had a tale of a woman warrior who now has a ""daughter"" that she must protect. The ending sets you up for the next adventure. Going back and thinking about it, Jovovich has been playing Alice for 10 years now. She doesn't look a minute older. Even the scene in the interrogation room where she is wearing a tiny sheet reminds you of her Fifth Element costume. Here, she may be older, but she really delivers and proves that she can continue to deliver for as long as she wants.",Resident Evil - Retribution
172,moorthyvlr,Rescue,7,5 October 2012,I knew from the beginning what to expect from this movie. This movie is more or less like the next episode of the previous one. All the action sequences are good but not without drawbacks. If people saw the After life they should have known that in this movie Alice is just like any other human. So if it was gunfight or hand to hand combat they should have taken some care to make her fight smart rather than hard. The storyline was not bad but if they have given some accounts by narration here and there it would been clearer. Resident Evil movies are usually innovative but in this movie there is not a single scene which had that innovative touch. Even with all this I liked this movie.If you want to see this movie and like it then don't expect anything totally new because it is blend of all the movies which came before this one with added rescue op.,Resident Evil - Retribution
173,ThePadraigMoista,"It's mindless, unrealistic and horribly written in terms of dialog, but damn it, it looks like a whole bucket load of fun.",6,30 September 2012,"Resident Evil: Retribution 3D is the fifth installment in the Resident Evil franchise and written/directed by Paul W.S Anderson, whose had a string of bad films throughout his career. I haven't seen the original few, the only one I saw was the fourth one and this one. The fourth one was alright, as was this one. I'm not a huge fan of action but this was just pure action. It was sort of like a fancy 80's action film. It had terrible acting, no character or plot development, characters I didn't care about, but it looked amazing. When action is done right, like cool slow-mo shots of one person conquering about 100 people, it looks cool. It's mindless, but looks cool. This whole film was mindless but looked cool. It didn't try and be more than it was, it knew it was cheesy, action and it ran with it. It is a bit predictable at times, but all in all, it is enjoyable. It's mindless, unrealistic and horribly written in terms of dialog, but damn it, it looks like a whole bucket load of fun. A solid 6/10.",Resident Evil - Retribution
174,joberfeld113,There's More Ugly or Bad than Good.,3,23 December 2012,"I did enjoy the first four Resident Evil movies, but less with each new installment. Retribution is the same story. As my review's tittle says, there is more ugly or bad than good. First the ugly: 1. Returning stars look like they are not trying anything new with their characters. Especially Jovovich and Rodriguez. The only other movies that were the fifth installment of their franchise or saga where the cast tries this are Star Wars: Attack of the Clones (Yoda fights Dooku), Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (a lot of characters), X-Men: First Class (tell an origin story of every character), and the upcoming A Good Day to Die Hard (take John McClane to Russia). 2. Paul W.S. Anderson's directing is at its weakest. Maybe do not need to explain this. 3. There is no character development which I find frustrating because Anderson finally adds Leon Kennedy. Leon is always a character that the fans want to learn more about because he was immediately so cool when he was first introduced in the second game and has never sunk to a level this low. Even in Degeneration and Damnation which are both much better than Retribution. When you do a movie you need to give each character a background story. Bruce Wayne's is a childhood without his parents. Jack Sparrow's is a life as a pirate. All the best characters in movie history have an excellent back ground story. 4. The writers were also very lazy in coming up with the story. Instead of a story that is not cannon with the games, why not give one that is. 5. What ever is going on in Retribution is tough to follow for the first half-hour except for about five minutes. 6. The acting is awful. Awful acting could easily kill a movie while great acting can save it. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy needed a great cast and got one. A lot of actors or actresses in video game movies really can not do anything. Retribution clearly backs that up. 7. The movie will not put you at the edge of your seat. You will just wonder when are they going to put you there. Movies like 1964's Goldfinger, 1977's Star Wars, 1989's Batman, 1991's Terminator 2: Judgment Day, 2003's Return of the King, and this year's Dark Knight Rises are great examples of how to put an audience on the edge of their seat. Second the Bad: 1. The movie tells you what is about to happen instead of staying silent about it. Staying silent about what is going to happen in the next few minutes is what made the story ark for other movie franchises or sagas great. Just watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes or Die Hard. 2. The ending. If you just watch it you will see why. And finally the only good that comes out of the movie: 1. The franchise still does not care. It just tries to be fun. I am fine with that. That is what movies are suppose to be. Unfortunately Retribution is no fun. Maybe Anderson should ask Titanic's Oscar winning director James Cameron how to make a follow up better than its predecessor. Two of Cameron's sequels have followed one of my favorite movies. If I have not reviewed them here yet, then when I do you will probably know which movies I am talking about. You may already. So that is both good and bad. 2. The only crew members who do not seem to be getting lazy is the visual effects team. With each new installment they have been getting better and better. They also took advantage of the 3D technology they were given to use. Retribution is the best looking live action Resident Evil. I can not think of any explanation needed here. Final verdict: Resident Evil: Retribution is visually awesome and that is the only redeeming value. Retribution is a soulless and uninspired installment in the most successful (and only one too) video game movie franchise.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Like others that have reviewed this pile., I am a fan of the game and the other films. The other films are pretty much get what you asked for, weak story but plenty of action and half naked Mila never hurts. But this film oh my is so bad so bad. What was Paul Anderson smoking when he dumped this out of his ass? Whatever you were on Paul please see a doctor as soon as possible. Mila shame on you! just cause he's your husband doesn't mean you can't say no!Action scenes laughable, music used to try and make the terrible acting and action more dramatic only made it more pathetic. I swear to all this is a film made by a child that only child would like for 5 minutes then go 'wish an adult had made this better'God awful god awful god awful god awful really can't think of anything else in my mind to describe this film other than god awful!!Sorry but man I have seen some weak crap but this, this is just a joke. seriously was this made for a bet??

I saw the first film for want of something better to do and have now seen them all at the cinema rather than at home and bought all the DVDs.From offending fanboys of the game, to upsetting the sensibilities of film snobs, there is much to commend it! Leave your brains at the door. Let them be eaten by zombies and marvel at the superb take on the genre.That action stands up to most over the top examples but where it wins are the in jokes and sly nods to the previous films.I'm not being trite.

177,doomas10,"Mindless, uber-stylistic fun",7,30 September 2012,"The latest installment of the ""Resident evil"" franchise is here. I am not a huge fan of the series but I am able to recognise their pop corn value. There is something awe-inspiring when it comes to zombie killing spectacle from heroines. Milla Jovovich should be proud since she has evolved into the number one action female lead of all time. She has kicked ass in ""The fifth element"", ""The messenger"", 4 Resi films, ""ultraviolet"", ""the three musketeers"" and ""a perfect gateaway""! Her presence is what solely keep this franchise from becoming a corpse. Not a bad actress at all, she utterly convinces that she is a killing machine. However, the rest of the cast are as wooden as possible although it is not their fault but Anderson's script. Most of the previous characters are back but have nothing to do most of the times or anything alike with their computer alter-egos besides sharing the same costumes. The plot holes are gigantic, the characters completely one dimensional while their actions are lacking logical explanations and do not even follow the momentum from the previous films. One main baddie even assists Alice to fight off Umbrella who surprisingly still after the zombie apocalypse, has a large number of security guards, laboratories and test facilities that operate completely!? Does these elements mean that the movie is atrocious? No. You just need to switch off your brain, relax and enjoy a string of well-orchestrated action scenes patched together with intense industrial soundtrack and high production values. This is a vast improvement over ""Afterlife"" and there are many scenes that pay homage to the first entry of the series. It has a constant video game feeling to it, with our heroes going from arena to arena to fight off monsters, zombies and various other monstrosities in destructive and explosive set pieces. The choreography is pretty impressive (the fight between Alice and Jill has been nicely done) along with excellent production design and action driven music, courtesy of Tomandandy. Anderson's direction definitely has style (the opening credits are all in reverse!) and I really hope for him to start directing other people's scripts besides his own. His dialogue is exposition at its finest with characters just explaining what is happening and where they are going next. No room for character development at all. And it is such a shame really because besides the first RE film, this one has lots of interesting ideas about biohazards and corporations that do not even get any exploration but rather mentioned briefly in a line or two. As I pointed out earlier on, do not expect a solid story. This is nonsense well-made zombie carnage crafted in such a way that won't generate any thinking but it sure is going to be handy for a movie night during winter. And the most positive thing: it looks bigger and has a better pacing than ""Apocalypse"", ""Extinction"" and ""Afterlife"" all together.+ music, production designer, fight choreography, visuals, nice script ideas, Milla! - script, one dimensional characters, heavy exposition, shame that the ideas are not fully explored6.5/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
178,damonous,If you liked the other RE movies (not just saying you did) you'll love this one,10,16 September 2012,"Since I've loved the prior RE films (save maybe #2/Apocalypse), and I thought Retribution was on par or a notch better then #4/Afterlife (which I considered the best to date) I feel I have to give this an Excellent rating.You have to consider for yourself what camp you're in, before you can digest my rating or this review. Are you in camp that has complained for 10 years now like a broken record that the movies aren't a carbon copy of the video game storyline (which, as I recall, started out as essentially a haunted house type of game)? Are you in the camp that has complained for 10 years now that this isn't a studious courtroom drama? or Are you in the camp that thoroughly enjoys the always-inventive, always-surprising & twisting plot line that Paul W.S. Anderson has consistently brought to screen (either as writer or director, or both as in this one)? If you're in the latter-most camp, I think you'll enjoy Retribution. The budget is higher, the action set-pieces more numerous and over-the-top, the zombies are faster and more-varied, the 3D more in-your-face, and Milla just somehow keeps looking hotter with each film. What's not to love? Having just seen this in multiplex-theater Imax, I was remarking with my friends that what's really cool about the RE films is how they add something subtle to each movie, which can make you look back on the previous ones in a slightly different viewpoint. Maybe not every plot-point is cleanly 100% covered every time in the series, but I give the film makers an A+ for having gotten to #5 and still having this much energy & purpose (with a #6 obviously being setup). Name another franchise with as much vigor & fun that has arrived at #5, hasn't been rebooted, and is this good.And to any true RE Movie fan who might be hesitant to see this based on rumors about returning characters who were previously killed-off: rest-assured that it's handled in a cool way which is definitely not the most obvious.",Resident Evil - Retribution

180,brionesb,Disappointing sequel,5,15 September 2012,"Paul W.S. Anderson knows how to make action movies, unfortunately that seems to be the extent of what he is good at as a director and even at that he has room to improve.The latest Resident Evil movie installment, RE: Retribution unfortunately is a bit of a disappointment coming off the heels of RE: Afterlife. Beneath all of the action & mediocrity, there is certainly potential for a much better movie than we were presented in Retribution. Case in point, almost the entire story is explained to us within the first few minutes of meeting Ada Wong while Albert Wesker ""presents"" Alice and the audience with her ""mission"" for this installment. Didn't anyone mention to Paul W.S. Anderson that a good storyteller shows us rather than tells us about things within the story? Unfortunately I think an opportunity to give weight & gravity to the story in RE: Retribution was wasted by Ada Wong telling us/Alice all about her escapades which lead up to them meeting and ultimately working together to bring down Umbrella.Story aside, the action is decent & very plentiful from beginning to end along with special effects galore. From the very moment that the movie starts to the very end, there is hardly a moment where something or someone isn't being shot at, blown up or taking a hit. This is both a good and bad thing since it means the movie constantly moves along but it also means that the action lacks any real intensity and becomes a little numbing after a while. In fact, by the time the final battle is reached, it all just feels excessive and anticlimactic due to the constant barrage of bullets, explosions and martial arts hits we are presented with. The 3D effect here are excellent considering that we are looking at real live actors on sound stages as opposed to computer generated images layered on a computer generated background. The depth of field is strong and the 3D effect lends a strong feeling that you are there where the action is and observing it all firsthand. There are some cheesy 3D effects where objects fly out at the screen which is par for the course but they seemed to be blended in well and didn't seem overly gratuitous. Thanks to the use of the same 3D cameras used to film Avatar and the RE: Afterlife, the effect is strong and suits the action fine.All in all, as mentioned earlier, I'm disappointed with this sequel. Paul W.S. Anderson missed out on an opportunity to tell a good story and build upon the solid foundation that was in RE: Afterlife. A little more exposition from the characters rather than the ""cliff notes"" explanation from Ada Wong would've gone a long way toward fixing that problem as well as pacing the action better would've done wonders to making this an infinitely more watchable film. If you're into movies with 3D, nicely done CGI effects and wall-to-wall action with a sprinkling of story, this will satisfy you just fine. Otherwise, wait for the release on Bluray 3D and save your money and time for the other action films coming out later this month!",Resident Evil - Retribution
181,tylamont-27758,Horrible,1,13 October 2021,"I simply can't understand how this film has received an average score. The acting is terrible, the way the plot has been executed is laughable.

182,etheesdad,a cynical excercise in re-hashery,3,5 December 2012,"I was disappointed. The movie itself is very closely modelled on the idea of playing a video game: in other words - a big action scene, culminating in the destruction of some kind of 'boss', followed by a short of cutscene that works as a minimal interjection of plot. Rinse and repeat about 10 times and thats the film in a nutshell. It did not appear really that much effort was put into the 'story' elements of the film, and most of the emphasis is on action sequences, which are all 'ok'. I really did not feel engaged by this film. If you like a lot of spectacle and not much else, you may find it entertaining. I kept finding myself bored by the lack of plot. Even the 'creatures' were exact rehashes from previous films in the series. Nothing new or interesting there. There was also a particular male character - played by Johann Urb - whos acting was so wooden that it was actually distracting from the story. The film makers knew they could cash in on this one without making too much effort to think about what they could contribute to the story or the character, and thats exactly what they did. Don't bother, unless you are a die-hard fan.",Resident Evil - Retribution

This movie was a total waste of time and money. There's no plot, just a situation that Alice has to fight her way out of. There are some good stunts but nothing we haven't seen before. Most of the action is just ridiculous...bad guys that don't die, guns that don't run out of ammo, characters that can be interchangeably good or evil at the whim of the scriptwriter. It's like a five-year-old playing with toy soldiers. The actors are so wooden, and look so plastic that I honestly couldn't tell if they were CGI creations or actual human beings.Milla and her husband should be ashamed of themselves.",Resident Evil - Retribution
184,ng_open_air,"This is not a movie, this is a video game",6,1 February 2013,"There is not much to be said about this movie. Even the most optimistic viewers wouldn't expect anything more from this than another zombie flick full of running, jumping, fighting, shooting, infinite amounts of bullets being fired, a little gore, and a shallow plot.As a horror, it's a disappointment; but to be honest, can you really expect to be frightened by a movie that you've seen four times already (this being the 5th sequel, and all of them are practically identical)? As a sequel to the franchise - yes, I must agree that this one is probably the worst and least amusing of all five movies, but that doesn't come as a surprise, because with this type of movies it's always the same, each new sequel is worse than the one before.But all of this didn't come as a surprise to me, and to be frank, this movie didn't disappoint me personally, in any aspect, because my expectations weren't that high anyway. It may have been done better, of course (there is always room for improvement), but I don't mind, really.There were numerous hilariously illogical ""mistakes"" in the movie (as one might call them), but I don't consider them as mistakes, as such ""mistakes"" happen in all R.E. movies and since all the movies are based on a video game (and we all know how video games can be). If this were an independent movie, I would totally trash it, but while watching it, I kept thinking to myself that I was actually playing a PC game, and of course you can expect that, for example, in a game a character runs through a rain of bullets and comes out unharmed. Because such games are essentially not about the story and logic, but more about the adrenaline. Though this raises a dilemma - why would anyone keep creating such movies, when we HAVE video games, and they serve better for that purpose? The answer is simple enough - to raise some more money living on old glory. The first movie was legendary, and the sequel to it was expected and welcomed - everything else was pretty much the same - mediocre and rather poor.I sincerely hope this one will be the last sequel of this franchise, just for the sake of keeping dignity of the original story. But, if they do make another one, I'll most probably watch it anyway.",Resident Evil - Retribution
185,mjf_722,"Not as bad as others in the series, but series does need a serious reboot.",5,13 January 2013,"I've read a lot of reviews about this movie and as a fan of the game series and as someone who's watched all the Resident Evil movies, this is NOT as bad as others in the series.That being said, I've sat through all the movies since the first. After the first of course, they've all went downhill. The second and fourth movies were pretty bad, boring, and didn't make much sense. The third was probably the best out of the sequels, but that isn't saying much when all the sequels past the first one were garbage anyway. After hearing how ""awful"" this movie was, I was prepared as I watched it and really, it wasn't that terrible - and certainly not as bad as some reviews claim that it is. I'd go as far as to say this was probably the second best out of all the movies or at least tied with the third movie.To say this was one of the ""worst films of all time"" is utterly ridiculous and the people who say that really need to watch more movies, because there are plenty of terrible movies that would be more deserving of that title. Expand your movie library maybe before you make such comments. Then again, these are some of the people who said that John Carter was ""one of the worst movies of all time"" and were also wrong about that. Yes, opinions.......but pretty poor ones. Believe me, there are plenty of garbage titles out there. At the very least, the action in this movie best other ""action"" movies' actual action. Yes this is my opinion only, but I've watched more than 10 movies unlike some of the ""experts"" out there who give such garbage and unjust reviews. Anyway, I sat through this expecting the worst and was able to follow the story through. They've already made a mess of this franchise with the other movies, so there was no redeeming it at this point. The action was of course entertaining and I like the idea of all the environments and clones. At least in this one, they had some zombies and references to aspects of some of the games, like Las Plagas. Again, comparing to the other sequels in this franchise, this wasn't bad. Just don't expect a masterpiece and allow yourself an open mind when watching this. If you're a fan of the franchise, I'd say watch it but don't expect something like the first one.The franchise as a whole does need to be rebooted badly though. Another director/writer needs to take over. They've rebooted (or are attempting to) a lot of titles whether they needed to or not and with the plump Resident Evil universe, there is plenty of material to start over with an not even come close to this. Anderson needs to go - and he needs to understand that he's not doing a great job with this franchise. Yes, it was nice of him to add known characters, but being that this is the fifth movie after all the damage done, it's too little too late now.",Resident Evil - Retribution
186,shariffo,Complete mess with no continuity...,2,29 January 2017,"Okay, I need someone to explain this to me... I've never played the games, read the books or watched the movie series. I decided to Marathon the entire movie series before watching The Final Chapter. This entire series had weak acting, cheesy action, cliché plots and flaws all around. This, I'm okay with and I am used to, and I've never took it as a serious franchise. This particular film however was a complete mess with inconsistencies. Had me saying 'What?' a dozen times before eventually just getting bored and rolling with it. Here's a few questions.. 1) How is Wesker alive? He blew up in 'Afterlife.' 2) How is Wesker human again? He was infected and all messed up. 3) How does the real Alice know sign language? And why? 4) What was the point of Sign language if everyone spoke in the film...? Including the fake girl and fake Alice mother? 5) Why was Alice in that facility if the Red Queen wanted her dead? 6) How did the Red Queen take control of Umbrella Corp? Since when?? 7) Why the random puzzled plot? It doesn't fit with the rest of the series?? 8) Why the familiar faces of the previously deceased? Are they clones? Why them?? 9) Was Jill a clone or was she real?The list can go on... this entire film had me question what was going on and who was who. This is probably the first time I ever felt like a series is genuinely being MILKED for money and business. People say it all the time, but this...? Yeah, now I'm a believer of that saying.

And Anderson is obviously too tired of it all to give us any reason to care about either the characters or the story (limited as it is). Overall this installment made 'Doom' seem like a veritable 'Gone With The Wind' by comparison and that isn't easy to do.With creativity the first casualty after the opening sequence Anderson has undeniably delivered up a movie as forgettable as the most droll of his zombies and leaving franchise badly infected by the banal.

Retribution picks up right where the previous movie left off with an overly long and useless title sequence that takes up almost 10 minutes.The plot is **spoiler alert** almost exactly the same as the first movie: fight your away out of a large complex, with the same exact enemies (zombies and the Red Queen). The only difference between Retribution and the first movie, is that the complex is underwater instead of underground and there are a few minor differences in what actors are used. Clichés are abundant and you can easily predict at every turn what's going to happen next. Plot holes are also rampant and extremely glaring.Paul Anderson put absolutely zero effort into this movie, wasting time with useless references to better movies (Dead Snow and Alien were really obvious) and video games (Starcraft in the final scene, with the **spoiler alert** mutalisk-esque flying zombies), and the actors followed suit. I know they can act better, but for some reason (the movie being crap, maybe) they delivered their lines with all the enthusiasm of a man giving a eulogy for his newly dead wife of 60 years. Every line is forced and wooden - they're terrible lines, but c'mon. You're actors, so why are you acting so badly? Maybe the movie could have almost been saved a little bit if there was some effort on someone's part. Milla and the little girl did alright, but for everyone else it has to be their worst acting yet.The digital special effects were also bad; clearly someone didn't allocate enough of a budget to that department. The action was decent some places, but horribly fake in others. There's also the usual action-movie suspension of disbelief with jumps, flips, and rarely reloading; but I can forgive that just because that's typical these days.You'll also notice that I haven't made any comparisons yet between this film and the actual Resident Evil games - that's because it's best to pretend that the movies are only very loosely based on the games, because you'll probably just get angry otherwise at how bad Paul Anderson screwed things up. As stand-alone films go, Resident Evil: Retribution is bad enough. One of the worst films I have ever watched.Overall the movie is a waste of time, but it's mercifully short with only about an hour of actual movie (intro/credits take up almost 30 minutes). Thankfully I didn't waste extra money to see this in 3D. I dearly hope that the next movie is going to be better, but I have serious doubts after seeing Retribution.",Resident Evil - Retribution
190,dezsokekovacs,Nothing original,1,21 September 2012,"If you'd seen Resident Evil 1,2,3,4 and Aliens (1986) (when the mutant kidnapped the little girl) then you had already seen this movie.Nothing original (only maybe the ""intelligent"" zombies in Moscow – it sounds a little bit strange ""the intelligent zombies"" – especially when zombies are typically described as mindless, reanimated corpses with a hunger for human flesh, and particularly for human brains in some descriptions). The stupid producers thought that 3D is everything. And, of course, how intelligent could be the people who rated this ""nothing in 3D"" with a 10? I don't knew, till now, that they fought against clones made by a computer called ""the red queen"" who wants to destroy humankind.

193,KevinMariblanca,Not Oscar-worthy (dur?!) But still epic...,9,16 September 2012,"I understand what all the hate for this movie is all about. But for the heck of everything I loved the movie. I watched this with my family expecting absolutely nothing! I mean come on RE does not really pride itself with witty one-liners or insane plot twists. Its a simple story about a bad corporation who wanted EVERYTHING! Even if it meant eradicating the human race then comes our heroine Alice who never dies (which I find cool and silly at the same time) and fights this corporation GUNS FREAKING BLAZING! By this time, I am pretty sure you know how the story goes and how future sequels will go through with this (which I am sure there will be MORE)unless some outlandishly good and creative writer and/or director comes in to play and decides to revamp this series (I will welcome that person with open arms hopeful that with a new approach the old action scenes are kept with the same intensity) Acting is okay... I mean what do you expect? HELLO?? Get out of your hole for one minute and just enjoy! The actors were just full of bad- assery I didn't mind it that much that none of those performances were in the levels of Meryl Street or Philip Seymour Hoffman but still it complimented the show's playfulness and brute. Story - mentioned this before already, ITS A NO-BRAINER!WORD TO THE ""SERIOUS"" CRITICS: Stop being to harsh on this film. It wasn't made to satisfy your insatiable longing for the next Slumdog Millionaire and frankly, I don't think they care much about what you say. They just shoot some zombies, monsters, etc. and just have some damn fun with it! If you want a morally upheaving movie don't watch this. It will not get you anywhere. FINAL NOTE: I gave this a 9 not because of its story, acting, or anything that I would consider if I am seriously critiquing this movie but my rating is based on how much I enjoyed myself and not once did I yawn or even lean on the back of my chair it was a fun ride and I wouldn't mind watching RE6.",Resident Evil - Retribution
194,jjvz1989-224-63907,Why is this so popular?,1,15 September 2012,"I have fond memories of every Resident Evil game in the main series and I am a fan still clamoring to play Biohazard 1.5. I still remember renting the directors cut of the first game way back in the 1990's. Of course back then we had the rumours of a George A Remero directed film that would be released after the commercials starring Brad Renfro started airing in Japan. For awhile we were under the mistaken belief that the father of zombie films would be bringing one of the best zombie video games to the silver screen. In 2002 we were unfortunate enough to see the first film of a truly bad what would become movie franchise. It saddens me to see that the franchise will most probably see a sixth entry.The film starts off with a slow mo scene played in reverse, then just played, what should have been the ending of the last film is the beginning of the new film and I wouldn't be surprised if it was the ending of the previous film as we are then treated to a recap by Alice herself of every other film. What a waste of time and money. A homage to the zombie films of the 70's is the best scene in this film where Alice is now living in Suburbia with a husband and an kid. the zombies pile in and Michelle Rodriguez is reintroduced as the most worthless character, unsurprisingly it is a clone. the scene ends and we return to an truly awful storyline. It tries to imitate Operation raccoon City or the mercenaries play mode by having different scenarios in Moscow, New York and Suburbia, it is explained by the crap story point that umbrella tried to sell the virus by showing potential buyers what the T Virus is capable of. It also introduces Ada Wong at this point looking very much like the character in the game, not very well acted by the actress but that has become an trademark of the franchise) so it is an surprise when the Kevin Durand actually makes an decent Barry Burton and it is a joy even for a few remote seconds to be treated to an character that was in the video game that is actually done justice. Leon s Kennedy also appears but he is not given much screen time and unlike Kevin does not stand out and it is all to blame to the fact that Alice should be kept alive and invincible (could this be due to the fact that the director is married to Milla Jovovich). Albert Wesker, let me just stop there i don't want to talk about that butchering. Aside from the overall acting with an few exceptions, the backgrounds especially in the 3d version seems like it was done through the age old method of playing a film behind the actors and actresses, this does not do much especially in 3d, it looks crap and it does not have the charm other bad movies have or the old time horrors have. the film is bad in every aspects, the trailers is better than the film hell, the trailer for devil may cry had better story line than the entirety of this film.the sad thing about this all Resident Evil return and so will Alice. Paul WS Anderson will get richer though he has an less than stellar career and has made mediocrity into a industry that is profitable. Stop these kind of films now and in the future we might have an industry based on quality rather than quantity. As for my love of the games, can't wait for Resident Evil 6 (once again clarification the game not the film.) but please no more spin offs.",Resident Evil - Retribution
195,F_Mizra,Totally Garbage,1,22 September 2012,"Two words for it: TOTALLY GARBAGE! Hollywood has butchered this awesome game-series to the level of beyond recognition, unlike the butchering of its previous movie-series. There are two types of people who would critic this film: the die-hard fan of Resident Evil franchise and the ordinary film-goers. I've seen this in 3D, and as a RE purist gamer, these four criteria are on my checklist: 1) Stick to the game's storyline; 2) Brilliant plot if criterion #1 is too difficult to visualize; 3) Awesome 3D effects and 4) Well-coordinated cast. Like being sucked by the virus of Las Plagas, Hollywood had sucked completely the first three criteria! Even criterion #4 is somewhat only mediocre to be mentioned of. If you're in the second group, you'd be also feeling disappointed. Guaranteed. At least the previous four movies though lack of criterion #1, they still have decent criterion #2. The original storyline developed by Capcom are far far different and brilliant enough! I tried a little bit of the first PC-based RE game, watched my bro played RE Nemesis, and played myself PS2-based RE Code Veronica, RE 4, and X-box 360 RE5. Each of them has bloody brilliant storyline. I could never understand why Hollywood would deviate from them and introducing non-original character of Alice. We don't need Mila Jovovich. We need Chris, Jill, Claire, Leon, Ada, Steve and Sheva. We've seen for the first time the adaptation of Ada Wong and Leon S Kennedy. Costume-appearance-wise, Ada is quite okay and she sticks to the agility of her character, though her voice is somewhat funny like a Chinese whom recently learned English. Leon, as my most favorite character in RE, was quite disappointing because in the film he's not much of a fighter and he should be clean-shaved too. He's not Thor for God's sake!The series have been transformed into typical Hollywood shoot shoot bang bang fantasy wrapped in so-called good CGI and without purity of original horror element. I feel like I'm watching Mortal Kombat or Street Fighter where there are endless mindless fighting scenes. And what's this tag-line about going global-sh*t?! You'll be deceived because the only truth of that comes at the very end of this pitiful short film, where you just starting to feel the hope and rejoice but then, ""The End"". 6.5? Really? Just save your money from watching this junk. Verdict: Worse than filthy zombies. Get it?",Resident Evil - Retribution
196,nocturn-07199,Lost the point,1,7 August 2019,When i think it couldnt get worse than 4th movie this proved me different. The plot is awfull and doesnt make sense at all. I'm very disapointed.,Resident Evil - Retribution
197,John-Athens,Resident Evil: Repetition,3,22 September 2012,"This week I saw two films; each directed by a man named ""Paul Anderson."" One film showed the maturation of a filmmaker who's not afraid not to take his material in a new direction. His film had no plot, but still told a story through its characters. The second film showed a filmmaker becoming more Benjamin-Button-esque in his craft, as his films are becoming more and more infantile. Now, I'm not a complete Paul W.S. Anderson detractor; I actually think ""Event Horizon"" and ""Death Race"" are underrated. But with his latest entry in the Resident Evil Franchise, I feel I'm running out of ***** to give.This movie starts off by continuing where the previous movie left off in REVERSE SLOW MOTION, which takes FORVER to play out. Later, the scene is played at normal speed, which lasts all of TEN seconds. So, after ""skype"" Alice explains the whole franchise to us, her in-movie version is conveniently transported to an underwater Umbrella facility after being knocked out from the previous battle. Everyone knows the best way to get from one set piece to another is to pull out the ol' knocked-out-awaken-in-unfamiliar-place troupe. Anyway, Alice wakes up with nothing but toilet seat cover paper separating the male audience from what they really came to see. Then she's interrogated, for no reason, and is later set free, at which point she finds weapons and a skin-tight leather suit hidden in her INTERROGATION room. She wanders Umbrella's state-sized, underwater bio-weapon testing facility that would have the architects of RAPTURE scratching their heads. She then meets up with one of this installment's random video game inserts, Ada Wong. As the two navigate the different test cities (levels), while every so often SAVING their game, the Red Queen trolls them by placing obstacles in their path. She also trolls the audience by telling us EVERYTHING she's going do before she does it. You see that? That's the movie driving in a convertible, with ""suspense"" in the passenger seat wearing sun glasses and a shawl.What proceeds is the same BS we've been seeing for the entire series. Slow motion action scenes, bullet-sponge protagonists, and characters so wooden you would think they were crafted by Tim ""The Effin Toolman"" Taylor. Also, like the previous installments, this movie leaves more questions than answers. Like why is Luther, a basketball player in ""Afterlife,"" part of Wesker's strike team? Why is Leon Kennedy working with Wesker when the two never crossed paths in the games? Speaking of Wesker, when exactly did he part ways with Umbrella? Because it sure as hell wasn't in the previous movie. And lastly, why the hell do they keep introducing characters from the game without giving them an ounce of actual CHARACTER? I've already mentioned Ada Wong and Leon Kennedy - the former of which does nothing but expose the plot (if you can call it that). But they've also decided to will Barry Burton into existence. Sure he's great (played by the always overlooked Kevin Durand), but he barely speaks and makes a selfless (read: pointless) sacrifice. I hate these movies with a passion of the Christ. Why do I keep watching them? I guess the same reason why people keep watching god-awful, would-be singers on ""American Idol"" fail during their auditions - it's and funny and a little bit sad. Well, Paul W. S. Anderson, I knew you, the master of sucky-video- game-movies, would make me laugh and cry.",Resident Evil - Retribution
198,Benton_Phillips,"Girls, Guns, Zombies and...",5,21 September 2012,"So what's this film about? you might ask, well there's girls and there's guns.. lots of them, and zombies.. lots of those as well. If you've decide you've wanted to spend your time watching a zombie franchise on it's fifth sequel then your standards are quite apparent and as such you will not be disappointed by the high levels of girl on zombie violence. But maybe this isn't enough for you, maybe you require an involved storyline dealing with the complexities of human nature.. as previously stated you've decided to watch the fifth sequel in a franchise just be glad that you have this kind of time on your hands.OK, the story is got to get from A to B, but oh know, zombies! Where's the tension there? ..did I mention they've only got two hours till the bomb explodes! Oh yeah there's a bomb!There's also a heavy dose of leather, soviet zombies and Michelle Rodriguez *breaks a man's heart*.I've given it a five merely because it's fifth in the series, films like this one transcend ratings.",Resident Evil - Retribution
199,robiisgod,RE: Retribution worth watching or totally useless?,6,19 September 2012,"Well, how to even start? I was looking forward to seeing this film, but didn't have high expectations and that was a good start. The initial trilogy had sense and a bit of realism, but the last two...well, to be quite honest I don't even know what the hell am I watching, except sexy Milla Jovovich and enormously high quantity of CGI and action scenes.I remember when I've seen the first RE. It was different, scary, action packed, but about the T-virus, zombies and escaping the HIVE. The second one continued with the recipe and I was blown away when they introduced Nemesis. It was such an action movie with a soul and then they gave Alice super powers. Which was kinda cool. The whole concept of being a mutant in an empty, soulless world as shown in Extinction...was once again different and fun to watch. The fourth one, tricky at least, I was happy to see more characters from the game series, but somehow I feel new characters was all it brought. It managed to keep me on edge. i was waiting, expecting and at the end...NOTHING. Kind of disappointing, but it gave a hint that everything will be clarified in Retribution.It gave a hint, but after the brilliant opening scene, recapitulating all the past events, we receive mindless CGI fighting scenes, no answers considering the Afterlife, just three questions; 1) How is Wesker ALIVE? 2) What the hell is this story about? 3) What's with the whole CLONE idea which was dumb even back in the 90s?????This movie is fun to watch if you like mindless action, but if you prefer a good story and motivation for the characters, then you'll find yourself disappointed. Even the zombies became secondary in this title - weird, considering this is a horror/zombie franchise.To conclude, i sure hope RE6 will return to its roots in some way and bring back REALISM and DEPTH to its story, considering it will probably be the last one, so at least don't screw it up, but conclude it in a respectful and decent way as it begun back in 2002.",Resident Evil - Retribution
200,ripleyclone8,Resident Evil: Retribution blows the last 4 installments out of the water!!!,10,14 September 2012,"This installment to the Resident Evil series was simply put.....AMAZING! The action was continually NON-STOP! Was I ever bored throughout one single moment in this movie HELL NO! The visuals were dramatically well done, the 3D was used effectively and the music was fantastic once again for the 5th chapter in the RE franchise.If you enjoyed the last 4 installments and aren't one of those annoying ""It was SO bad because of this and that. I hate this because it ain't like the freakin Capcom games."" type of people than you'll enjoy the living daylights out of this film.From the moment the movie starts the action, the music and the visuals pick up intensity. We rewind through a scene where Alice is fighting the Umbrella Corporation on the Arcada and from there on out the action continues until the very last scene.I truly have to give 50 thumbs up to Paul on this one. I never felt so entertained and exhilarated after seeing a Resident Evil movie like this one. The last 4 installments were missing something, you know that UMPH! To me this one got it! The fight scenes were incredible and the special effects in every scene were well done. The last scene where Alice has to fight Jill Valentine and where Rain has to fight Leon and Luther was just EPIC.Did I feel like this movie did its job? YES! Would I go see this again in the theaters over and over YES! Did I enjoy this more than the last 4 installments? Yes sir! I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoyed the last 4 films and has a true interest in the franchise. If you have seen the last 4 films and have some kind of interest in the story of the previous films and of Alice you'll like this film all the much more!

201,anizar_wiflfag,Anderson is ignoring fans,5,26 September 2012,"Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing visual adventure like anything you've seen before. It's a direct sequel to Resident Evil Afterlife and it fills many plot holes from that movie. But we cannot say the same for the other prequels.We didn't get an explanation about Angie/Jill absence in the last 2 movies (And we will never get it). Anyhow there is Jill, we only got some lines from Alice saying she is under Umbrella's control... really? how do you know Alice?In Afterlife we were told that the scarab device was some sort of an amnesia device, now it's a device who controls people. Who is behind all of this? who has been the bad guy from the beginning? who was the man responsible for this disaster? Alice have told us that it is Wesker, but prepare for the major revelation in a decade, a major twist, get ready... Oh... It's the red queen..... (wasn't she got fried in the first movie?) OK it makes sense that Wesker is on her own now, to stop the homicidal computer but how the heck we weren't told how she was able to survive?It is said that the outbreak was an incident, but it was not!!! Anderson have you seen the first RE? it was Spence!!!!Now it makes sense with the first RE, viral weaponry, to sell it in the black market and blah blah. Was the Tokio sequence from the 4th, the result of the test that it was been made in the Umbrella prime facility? (And no, it's not in Raccoon or Tokio anymore, is in the middle of nowhere in the Arctic)This movie should have been named Afterlife and 4th REtribution, because there is no REtribution in 5th but a lot of people who has come from death.We didn't get the Alice origins. Claire, Chris and K-mart have disappear without explanation, when we see the arcadia battle just when they are are zooming the ship we were hoping to watch them but then... fade out guys!!!!Now, Alice tells us that the undead has mutated, and it seems that there is a new parasite called Las Plagas (just like in the game), Leon (whose surname is not told) seems to know everything about it when bad rain injects herself with it. Alice how did you know who Ada was? We didn't get the Hunters (forget about those). I was hoping a big revelation about K-mart (maybe she could be sherry birkin), but again its Anderson.Anyhow you will enjoy it, even though they think we don't mind about story and we are just undead who want to see mindless action (and judging by the box office, we are)",Resident Evil - Retribution
202,greytuol,Save Yourself! Another Awful Sequel Has Arrived For Your Displeasure,3,15 September 2012,"Let's start off by saying that I would have awarded this film a lower rating but in all honesty i have seen much MUCH worse.The thing about this franchise is that it started off relatively well. The storyline was better structured and the general experience while watching the first two movies was entertaining. I have come to realise however was how very short lived this thought was and that the series has now continued on well over its sell-by-date, and frankly i think the movie-goers are paying the price by having to watch such absolute drivel due to a complete lack of quality scripting and good story-telling. Note to the readers: I would try and say more on this film but i can't - it is that bad. I can only advise that you do not waste your hard earned cash and see yourself waste the better part of 90 minutes of your life as i have done and see a better film. If you the viewers are interested in seeing a movie that is taken from a comic book or a computer game (and is out in cinemas at the time of writing this), you should go and see Dredd.In short - AWFUL!",Resident Evil - Retribution
203,joshey_kun19,Best of the Resident Evil Films,8,15 September 2012,"Resident Evil Retribution is definitely the stand out film of the series. It is smarter, with more action, more of a story, and it is more like a video game than any of the past RE films. It's surprising that it took this long to make a Resident Evil movie like this one.First off, I'd like to say I am a pretty big fan of the Resident Evil movies, even if they lack deep characters, and amazing story lines. I like Milla as Alice, and the action is always pretty sweet. For a lot of the movie, you see what you already saw in past Resident Evil films: Alice being her bad-a self as usual, action, and zombies. And of course there are some dialogue that either makes you roll your eyes, or laugh. But, there is a lot more in this film. This RE film shows more emotion from Alice, and we see her as more of a human, and a mother figure as she tries to protect a little girl introduced in the story, therefore we can make more of a connection with her. In the other RE films, no character had development at all, so it is refreshing to finally see a character we can connect more to, and feel for. Also, the story is actually pretty cool. Simple in it's idea, but a bit more complex in how it all played out. You see Alice going through stage after stage, just like in a video with boss characters, as she and her comrades try to escape from the Umbrella Headquarters. And how this movie went ""global"" was pretty intelligent. You would have to see the story to understand what I mean. It's also really great to see all the characters added into this film.Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong were both added into this film, and man, was Ada an amazing character! The women in this movie steal the show again, just like in the past RE films, so be aware of that if you were wishing Leon to be super amazing. He's not as cool as he is in the video game, but I was still pretty satisfied with his character, especially since they did better with Leon in this film than how Chris was in the fourth film. Unfortunately, we don't get to know all of the characters all that well, as a lot of them are still pretty shallow characters. But they still kicked butt for the most part. Which leads me to my next topic: The fight scenes in this film were the best I have ever seen in an RE film. Who cares if some of the things they do are pretty impossible. That doesn't really matter seeing as this is based off of a video game where characters do pretty crazy things anyway. The choreography for the fight scenes was well done, and much cooler than even fight scenes from Afterlife. Special effects were pretty amazing too, and probably the best out of the series.This film also feels more like a sci fi, which I feel is because of the allusions to other sci fi films, such as the Alien series, Inception, and Tron: Legacy. Although the only thing that really reminded me of Tron was from part of the soundtrack, and there was also a part where it sounded like Inception. Seeing as I'm against putting that many spoilers in my reviews, you'll just have to watch the film to see the allusions that I am talking about. I feel like it is kind of a sci fi tribute in a way.So pretty much to sum it up, even though this film is a lot like the other Resident Evil films in the series, which are a bit lacking in a few departments, it has even more to offer with a smarter plot, amazing fight scenes and action, and even better characters. They even made the soundtrack more epic. This is a step up, (well, maybe a few steps up) in this RE franchise, and I was pleased, and pretty content with how this film turned out. If you are one who hates the RE films, this one might (emphasis on might) make you a bit more happy, and if you are a fan of the series, this is a must see. It isn't the most amazing movie ever, but I've waited a long time to see an RE film as smart and amazing as this one. And I'm sure a lot of other people were waiting for something like this too. It's unfortunate it took this long to happen, but hey, better late then never right?",Resident Evil - Retribution
204,sean-cowan1,Not best in series but still a good addition,8,8 October 2012,"I don't understand the people that have literally bashed every single RE movie that has been made. The movies are supposed to be about one thing, and one thing only, hot women accompanied by a series of random dudes demolishing hordes of zombies and fighting Umbrella.This movie has a massive amount of that, with Li Bingbing, Sienna Guillory, and Milla Jovovich all looking extremely hot. The action is fast paced and cut well, the cuts are not so fast that you can barely see what is happening (like RE 3). The hand-to-hand between Alice and Jill at the end is quite good.The battle with the Las Plagas zombies was rather over-the-top and reminded me of Planet Terror. I didn't particularly like this part.Wesker having to abandon umbrella due to the Red Queen was interesting. I believe that at the end of the next film there will be a final battle between Wesker and Alice.Overall it gets an 8/10 from me. Like I said before, the two main elements of the formula which makes these films work were there, and despite my displeasure with the Las Plagas zombies, overall the film was good.",Resident Evil - Retribution
205,wolfybiscuts,Good action but not much characterization.,6,20 September 2012,"I've been a fan of the video game since 1996 and I was slightly disappointed that the movie series deviates from the games. The game doesn't even have Alice in it. What really got me about this film is that it seems the producers have a checklist and must think ....well who in the game hasn't appeared in the movie yet? Now let's just cut and paste them in there...anywhere with no back story relating to the game or movie worlds.It seems the movie had about 3 pages worth of dialog. And would have been a lot better with character interaction and disputes of some sort. But most of it is purely face off type one liners.The plot revolves around Alice who is trying to escape the umbrella facility. The world is overcome by a virus and some people have a shoot out in a computer program or simulator.Not much is mentioned about the virus and viewers are expected to know what fans of the game vaguely know. The action though is top notch and they nailed the cast, Ada and Leon are perfect and Jill isn't bad either. Barry was OK.I enjoyed the action but the movie could have been so much better.6 out of 10",Resident Evil - Retribution

I can't believe that they gave the fans more of the video game characters they love, as well as scenes that feel like an in game boss battle, and somehow it's an overall worse film than any of the ones before it...I literally forgot what the plot was more than once and the whole thing is as basic as possible.",Resident Evil - Retribution

209,rainbowijij,Awesome as always!!,9,18 September 2012,"I gave this movie a rating of 9 out of 10 as it is awesome!! Coming to the fifth movie of this series, I gotta say the writer did a very good job. I appreciate how the writer can keep the movie interesting without adding anything new to it. After all it's all about the Umbrella Cooperation and how it tries to kill Alice. The story is intense, audiences can really feel the emotions and excitement in it. Each and every scene of this movie is excellent. The 3D effect is cool and the slow motions are making this movie even more attractive.There are LOTS of gun shots and fighting scenes in this movie, more like people-to-people than people-to-zombie, which quite disappoints me. I expect more zombie thing in it.(I know it's hard to keep it fresh with the some old zombies but I just can't help myself from expecting that!) I love seeing gross things, luckily there are monsters coming around which fulfills my desire.By the way, Milla Jovovich is super hot and sexy in this movie, I don't think this movie will be as good as now without her.This movie is definitely highly recommendable!! overall rating: 9/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
210,buckshockey-415-432622,Resident Evil Desperation,1,8 October 2012,"Resident Evil Retribution 3D.**** Please note that my review does contain spoilers so read on, knowing that I talk about the film.Firstly the franchise have really gone to town on ripping off the public, show the film only in 3d, does that mean that when the film comes out to buy, (probably before Christmas 2012) that we can only buy the film in 3D?, that would mean that the majority that are fans of the franchise will not be able to buy the film unless they have a 3d TV and 3d blu ray player.So why make fans of the series have to spend extra money on the film just because we the public don't get a choice between 2d or 3d.The film is supposed to continue from the last film , and within the opening sequence within 10 minutes we have a flashback to give the link to why, and then the film continue's trying to make a consistent story.To me the story is weak and a few new character's appear which don't really have a story to how or why they should be really in the film, apart from the obvious, lets have a spin off in the future if this film is successful. OR release a game within a 5 days of releasing the latest film.Mila plays Alice and looks fantastic but is the character and the real story which has now been put over 5 films and 10 years in the making. Question surely is how much longer can this series continue?1.Resident Evil (2002)2.Resident Evil: Apocalypse (2004)3.Resident Evil: Extinction (2007)4.Resident Evil: Afterlife (2010)5.Resident Evil: Retribution (2012)",Resident Evil - Retribution
211,cosmic-28,This was a blast!,7,14 September 2012,"The Resident Evil series is a guilty pleasure of mine and this movie was just a blast from the beginning to the end. Milla Jovovich is so fun to watch as Alice. This the 5th installment of the franchise is visual masterpiece. With the additions of Ada,Leon and Boris add so much to this movie. If you are a fan of the games and have been a complainer about the movies may not follow the game well this one fixes all of that. If you go see this movie I fell you must see it in 3D as I did. Every cheesy gimmick of things flying at the screen is in this and well it works that is what a 3D movie is supposed to do. You pay extra to see stuff come at you so why not do some overkill. A surprise in the plot comes at you within 10 minutes from the start. This movie is so entertaining with fights,action,sound and yes even got startled a couple times. Go enjoy this movie and even if you have never seen the series. This movie explains a lot at the beginning. Get out of your house and go enjoy!!!!",Resident Evil - Retribution
212,industraworks,This movie Kills!! RE: Retribution FTW!!,10,14 September 2012,"First, I'm no reviewer, but this movie delivered. So I just wanted to say a few things about it. I don't play the games, so I don't suffer from the hate people seem to have of Resident Evil movies. This movie is the best of the series in my opinion. Though none of these movies have a really in depth protagonist arc per say, I still enjoy them. The other RE movies were hit or miss with lack luster plots and kind of lame scenes. RE: Retribution on the other hand surpasses them, mainly because of its simple yet effective plot. RE: Retribution seriously brought the madness this time around, from the beginning to the very ending... a mad house! This movie is what it is, and that is good! Saw this at AMC Imax in Austin just a few minutes ago, it was effing nuts! Can't wait for the next.",Resident Evil - Retribution
213,Anoke,On pair with RE1,10,7 October 2012,"I absolutely loved Resident Evil: Retribution. It's far better than 2 and 4 ...and better than 3-rd one. Now, let me explain why:1. The storyline cleverly ties things from all previous movies. 2.Milla looks superb - sexy, beautiful and having a blast. She looks much more prettier here than in RE4. 3. The return of my all time fav Milla's outfit - two sheets of papaper covering naked body ;-) 4.Action never looked better in Resident Evil (the car chase in Moscow is amazing). 5. Milla's fights - as good as in RE3. G-R-E-A-T. 6. The scene in the factory of clones. ""I'm your mother now"". Great moment 7.Cool homage to Aliens. 8. Inventive score. 9. Visual effects - more photorealistic than in Avangersand other plastic-fantastic 4-times-biiger-budget summer attractions. 10. Epic scope. Grand scale. 11. Paul Anderson's direction - wide shoots, some Mulcahy's style shoots. 12. Doube ending with a nice cliffhanger. 13. Suburban sequence. 14. ""The return to suburban| sequence. 15.

214,joshthomasg,Resident Evil: Retribution (3D),3,20 September 2012,"The Resident Evil franchise has been good to me. In this review I can only voice my own interest in the franchise, I should also note that the Resident Evil series should not be seen as films, but as mere products to help sell the next video game. That is of no consequence to me, I understand what to expect before I pay for my ticket, and I've known what to expect ever since I paid to see Resident Evil: Apocalypse. I have been a loyal fan of the series since its inception, and I managed to see the first movie on DVD when I was about 14 years old. At first I didn't think the movie was good, I thought it was disgraceful. But, gradually the first Resident Evil movie became my guilty pleasure. I've somehow learned not to pay attention to the storyline, because there is none, you won't find a storyline in the Resident Evil movies, they purely stand on their own, and the only thing that holds them is its leading lady, Milla Jovovich. The reason for such an ambiguous approach is that more sequels could be milked until people get sick of them. Here's what I love about Retribution, and all those other movies that came before it. Two words. Milla Jovovich. Milla Jovovich is an iconic and legendary figure in the action genre. Just like Greta Garbo was queen of the silent era, and Bette Davis the queen of the talking picture, Milla Jovovich owns the action genre. There is never a dull moment when Milla Jovovuch is kicking ass, shooting her weapons in glorious slow motion, and not to mention her high-flying kicks. This babe is what has transcended the entire Resident Evil series into art. Yes, I said ART. The art of ass-kicking has never looked so good with Milla in her tight spandex, blazing sub-machine-guns in 3D. If you want a reason to watch this movie, then there it is. Paul W.S. Anderson is no hack either, he's interesting as an action director, more so than abysmal hacks like Luc Besson, even more so than Robert Rodriguez. I also love his futuristic set piece, you must admit that they are very creative. As long as Milla Jovovich stars in these movies, they can count on my 15 bucks to watch her. For those complaining about the movies not being like the games, you try and a adapt a video game into a movie! To make a film out of a video game, you need to recreate the entire thing, because all you do in the games is solve puzzles and shoot at zombies for countless hours. How can you make any kind of cinema out of that? It's impossible. It;s like trying to drive a car without an engine, you have a good looking body, but no engine to make it go. And that's what Resident Evil games are in a nutshell, they look good and scary - but that's about it.",Resident Evil - Retribution
215,TyLee896,Another masterpiece!,10,15 September 2012,"After the first 4 successful films, we have the fifth installment. Okay, so the idea is that the whole film is a simulation, and that carlos and rain are fake. The story is quite interesting, The character development was good, Leon, barry, Luther, and 2 various characters were all a team. Each character was done very well. My favorite was Ada, her and alice fight side by side throughout the entire film. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't enough wesker, but hey, I won't give out too many spoilers. The effects were great, great acting, great plot, and great characters. Resident evil fans will love this film. -Don't worry Ashley! I'm coming for you!- Leon",Resident Evil - Retribution
216,sean-palmqvist,Poor directing. A disappointment.,5,17 September 2012,I almost walked out from this one. It was almost a B movie. The effects were like the only good parts of the movie. The previous Resident Evil movies were a lot better than this one. I frankly found this one to be quite disappointing. Too many scenes with blazing guns. The actors lines were often dry and amateur sounding. I almost feel sorry for the actors who probably may have thought that this one was not like the previous movies. There were hardly any zombie scenes either in this one. I could never watch this one again. I supposed this movie is more for like younger teens and video game addicts. Its really just a shooter. This one is not worth watching at the cinema. Wait for the DVD version if you wanna see it instead.,Resident Evil - Retribution
217,MovieMadChrisB,Resident Evil : Retribution,4,29 September 2012,"Firstly I would just like to say that I am not a hater of these films, I am a huge fan of the resident evil franchise. The first film in the franchise is one of my favourite horror films that I have seen. I was really looking forward to the film, I have watched the trailer quite a few times in anticipation and I was so pleased when it was finally released here in the UK. I have just returned from the cinema, and for the first time ever with a Resident Evil film, I was left disappointed and bored. The action scenes, we have all see before in the previous films, they were too loud, stupid and seemed rushed in places. The acting was just about bearable, although Milla Jovovich, Michelle Rodriguez and Aryana Engineer did do the best with what they were given. And there was no story whatsoever. The set pieces were all too familiar, Anderson seems to be recycling parts from previous films.Another aspect of the franchise I am not liking is the constant change to Alice. In the first film she had no powers, then in Apocalypse, Alice was injected with the t-virus giving her superhuman abilities, which constantly evolve throughout the third film, Extinction. Then at the start of Afterlife, her powers are removed by a serum injected by Albert Wesker, making her human again, and now at the end of Retribution, Wesker injects her again with another virus making her superhuman again. It just seems to me that Paul W. S. Anderson is just making the storyline up as he makes these films. The slo-mo scenes were just about watchable in the previous film, but there are far too many of them in this film. There weren't many aspects of this film that I like, but one of the more positive reasons is the return of the original cast from the first Resident Evil film. It was nice to see Michelle Rodriguez and Colin Salmon return to the franchise, but the idea of them being clones just doesn't make any sense. Another positive were the zombies and the mutants looked really good. I never normally agree with the critics, the first four Resident Evil films all received negative reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. This film, however, is the first that I do agree with the critics. It's wasn't as good as I hoped it was, and maybe this franchise has finally run its course. After this film I don't know if I will watch another Resident Evil film.Overall this is the weakest film in the franchise. And that is from an avid fan of the previous films.",Resident Evil - Retribution
218,NyxEos,Filler,5,7 February 2013,"I love the Resident Evil films. This one I was particularly excited for because of the return of Michelle Rodriguez, who I always love.The good? There is very little downtime here. If you're looking to watch an hour and a half of shoot outs and explosions, this movie is for you. As always the actors are great, (and lets face it, great to look at). It had a cool intro as well.The bad? The plot. Why? Because there basically isn't one. There is no character development (although there was some fun in seeing different characters). For all the action that does occur in the film, the plot could be done within five minutes. This movie is very obviously a filler, just a short piece of blood and explosions to explain how Alice and the others fared from the end of the last movie to the start of the next. Moreover, after this many Resident Evils, most of the fighting techniques have already been seen. In the end, if you're a Resident Evil fan I suggest watching it simply so you'll know where you stand when the next movie comes out. If you're not, you might want to pass.",Resident Evil - Retribution
219,spikethelobster,Shameful waste of a great franchise,1,16 April 2014,"I'm a big fan of the RE movie franchise, even though I've never played the games. Milla Jovovich is an action heroine of the highest calibre, always bringing charm, humour and a hardass attitude to the films. However, this outing is an embarrassment. I'm sure it was intended to be a high-octane non-stop thrill ride of an action roller-coaster (or some such journalistic expression), but it turns out to be a single, never-ending action scene with no redeeming qualities.There's no story. There's no characterisation. There's no suspense. The dialogue is appalling and is almost universally delivered as if it was made up on the spot and voiced by robots without personality. The dramatic scenes are painfully bad. There's no tongue-in-cheek humour to carry the drama. For that matter, there's no drama.The action scenes are patently ridiculous. The bad guys can't hit anything with 40,000 rounds of ammo; they can't even stop a normal car with a 50-cal. The good guys can kill anyone - as long as they're not a bad guy with a name - with a single shot, and only need a single clip to get them through several hundred enemies. Even the ""biohazards"" are pathetically weak, not to mention rare.In the end, it's a story about Alice - who we do care about because, y'know, she's Alice - escaping from somewhere we don't care about. She gets help from other people we don't care about, has to save a child we don't care about, and does so in such a long, painfully arduous way that, by half-way through, I rather wished she'd die and get it over with.Even the finale - which is without any twists - consists of an interminably long, stupid, tension-free fight scene where all the good guys suddenly become incompetent and can't kill anyone.An insult to everyone involved. If they make a sixth, I hope Anderson realises his writing skills are non-existent and gets a proper story.",Resident Evil - Retribution
220,ljmendones,Not the thing I was actually expecting,3,19 April 2013,"At the trailer I was so psyched about watching it I thought it would be the old fashioned yet unique style of Zombie films but the arrangement of the scenes are very screwed up the scenes that audiences thought would be the last is the first scenes, people would be very disappointed and even though it is already 2013 I have not yet recovered from the movie's story and arrangement. The movie is liked a video game cut short in an hour and a half, this movie is supposed to make other zombie films trash but instead it made itself trash, because all of the brilliant ideas has already been given to the first,second and third installments. The movie was pointless, it made me looked embarrassed for making my family to watch this trash, but Jovovich' acting was amazing but she did not deserve to be in this garbage.",Resident Evil - Retribution
221,AdaMadaPia,Strong Women Kicking Butt!,9,9 March 2016,"I love all the Resident Evil films, but this was probably one of my favorites in the franchise. For starters, it was great to see many familiar faces return to the screen for this installment. The return of Michelle Rodriguez, Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, and Colin Salmon was terrific. Although the acting was a bit contrived, it didn't really dampen my enjoyment of this movie because the action scenes, fight sequences, special effects, and the music was simply top notch. One of my favorite things about this film (as in all of these films) is the leading ladies. Jovovich, Rodriguez, Guillory, and Bingbing Li stole the spotlight as the primary fighters and they didn't disappoint. No damsels in distress here! Not only can the women keep up with the guys, but they excel at it. A lot of times, the kids in these kinds of movies can be irritating, but that was not the case with Becky, at least for me. I thought she was adorable and sweet. See? Kids don't always have to be pouting brats. :) The final fight scene was the best part of the whole movie and Jovovich and Guillory killed it. I also loved watching Rodriguez square off with Luther and Leon, despite the fact that they were easily twice her size, though the loss of Luther was heartbreaking. I was also relieved that Jill was freed from the influence of the Red Queen. Loved her in Apocalypse. It was an interesting twist that Wesker turned against Umbrella to help save mankind and I'm curious to see how he turns out in the next film and whether or not Alice makes good on her promise to kill him. I also hope to see the return of Chris and Clair Redfield. Very enjoyable film if you can look past the somewhat hokey acting and I look forward to the next installment.",Resident Evil - Retribution

It just rehashes bits and bobs from previous RE movies, and adds absolutely nothing to the series. I think I'm being generous with two stars...I clicked on the option that there's no spoilers here, but to be honest, this movie spoils the franchise itself.

Apart from the once in a while visuals, the movie has not been able to get even close to expectations. The first 10 minutes of the movie and you will start feeling disconnected from the movie already not caring at all what is gonna happen in the next scene. After resident evil 3 & 4, I was expecting a lot out of this installment and from Paul W.S. Anderson but he has not been able to live up the mark at all. The action scenes rather than being nail-biting, turned out to be hilarious and funny. There isn't a single moment in the movie where you are actually glued to screen. Milla Jovovich looks pretty as always, but that won't save the movie. All others have done a horrible job with their acting, especially Sienna Guillory. I would say that the only reason you would want to watch this movie is if you are a fan of the resident evil series and you don't mind wasting your money and time for the sake of this series.",Resident Evil - Retribution
227,MKProcks66,Waste of time,6,19 January 2013,"I always like zombie movies. There are so many zombie movies that I like. But for Resident evil movies I always feel different. Zombies in this movie are different than other classical zombies. Though I liked 1st and 2nd movie of this series. But then later movies were not so impressive.And now I watched Retribution and I can say that if it would have been a video game rather than a movie then I would have definitely enjoyed this. This movie was so predictable. While watching this movie you can tell what is going to happen next. Same old actions, same old monsters, same old faces .Paul W.S. Anderson was good in directing 1st movie, but I couldn't understand what he was thinking while creating this movie. If you like actions without bothering about story, then I hope you will like it... Yeah I just hope, I am not sure, even in that case also. Honestly saying, I didn't like any moment of this movie.

Retribution is just one more aleatory action movie, that features a laughable acting and some horrible combat scenes. Shame on Paul W.S. Anderson. If you're not a fan of the franchise, avoid it.

Come on! That's a lot Asian actress in Hollywood better then her!This movie make me think of this few question:Did Paul W.S. Anderson got any idea what he's doing?Did Paul W.S. Anderson finish the script before shooting the movie?Did Paul W.S. Anderson just finish the script in 1 page of A4 paper? Did Paul W.S.

230,madspike212,I enjoyed it! Even if it was terrible!,7,10 January 2013,"All in all, the story was pathetic. Everything else was pretty good though! Well except the acting... The action was fine even if they thought slowing everything down for nearly every scene would somehow improve it. The effects were cracking and because its a fan based series (and I am a mechanical, corner, air propelling, osculating boy) it delivered enough for me to enjoy the movie without wanting to rip it to shreds. There are parts to the film which do unfortunately destroy it. In order *SPOILER ALERT*1) Wesker being in it again. I don't understand but this bugger wont die. I can accept that he must be somehow woven into the story to fuel it. Its just the last time I remember he had his face opening up along with his dogs opening faces and trying to eat people. Why he wants to help now, who knows, it didn't help me with the plot.2) Special effects are always great in movies. One of the ones that is great when used well in context is ""Slow Motion"". Which in this case was used a lot. There is a phrase ""Less is More"" which seems to have passed by the director. Maybe someone could utter it into his ear please.3) There were some bits that really were not needed. Like parts that would drag the film out longer than was needed. For example, the scene where Alice enters the control room. Before we can even continue to the main event we have to watch every single light on the floor individually illuminate before getting to the point that tables decide to ascend! Once again it was a matter of ""Less is More"". Entering the room and having lights suddenly come on and tables with dead bodies would have been just as dramatic (if not more I think).4) When the hell did zombies learn to shoot?5) At the very end, I am sure with the amount of bones we heard crack Alice should have been an invalid. Sure she ""WAS"" superhuman though prior to this movie she was rendered normal thanks to Wesker. Which is why it was unbelievable she was able to hold a gun to shoot the ice, let alone breathe! Same with Leon, his arm was broke. How did he keep throwing his left arm for a punch?In conclusion, with these few annoyances throughout the film it is still a good watch. Fans like me will still get what they want out of it which is why it still deserves a 7 in my eyes. Then again I find I can be quite lenient.

232,Gameprogirl,Resident Evil Insane Asylum,1,17 September 2012,"I watched Resident Evil Retribution today and I wish I could go back in time and erase this garbage from my memory. I love the resident evil games and I enjoyed the first few movies, this one was one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. The plot was not really there, full of cheesy one liners, bad acting by most of the cast, bullets that don't kill, weapons that never run out of bullets, and horrible character development.The story in this movie made no sense, and there were hardly any zombies. Even the action scenes were slowed down and the CGI was not that great. This was a pathetic excuse for a resident evil movie.Anyone who is expecting something action packed with a great story should look away from this film. It was GARBAGE and if I could give it minus stars, I would.",Resident Evil - Retribution
233,GabrielGray,It's nothing about global!,5,15 September 2012,"Frankly speaking I was a little concerned that I didn't watch the last (two?) episodes might have given me some trouble following the lines. Nah, it turned out fine anyway... Huge thanks to the opening ""Previously on R.E."" minutes, didn't expect to recall my shocked memory one decade back (that scientist headed off by elevator, ouch!)Back to our new story, Milla stays the same strong, charming and loving Alice as we knew she would be. Pretty new face (here in this movie) Li presents another style of oriental sight which suits her just fine.That's all I have to talk about this movie, thanks for reading... No? Oh, almost forgot about the ""story"". Well you know, they gave you the map, weapons show up just before you finish your last bullet, monsters never die easy, and so are the leading characters, talk to NPCs for necessary help and keys to the next level then through them out of your mind unless you need to use them later (yeah lady Ada in red I'm talking about you). Baseline: watch it the way you play R.E. the game without hitting your game pad and you won't be disappointed by the childish storyline or pale dialogues and the way they read them.But don't get your pillow ready yet, I'm not saying this isn't worth watching. Visual effects and 3D usage are cut and finely designed. Throughout the movie you'll find it enjoyable and comfortable to watch, well except when Barry (or is it him?) busted one head of strawberry jam right on your face. And moreover, the backwards scene at beginning is truly brilliant and sparkle of the movie.One last thing, for real now, what the hell do you mean by GLOBAL in big font on your poster when the most global thing I see are the empty theme parks 100 meters under the sea? Or next time you'll build a planetarium and claim it universal?",Resident Evil - Retribution
234,Sam_tennis92,I had a blast watching it,9,2 December 2012,"It is sad that most IMDb users don't appreciate an action packed movie, one thing I have learned is not judge a movie by help of reviewers on this site. Don't bother was the trailer as well due to the spoilers, watch it with no expectations !!This movie was action packed with awesome fighting scenes, unfortunately as many said the story was not the best but I like how the producers think outside the box. This sequel was kinda extraordinary. If you want to have action with gore watch this definitely ! Hopefully they will release a new one that continues from where this movie ended, bad ass ending as well :)",Resident Evil - Retribution

This is a movie shot in a studio alone, not a single frame has seen the real light. Retribution reminded me of kill bill movie, but with worst direction and screenplay. Most of the scenes looked like a video game with background music. I don't know what happened to the director all of a sudden after directing wonderful previous sequences. May be this movie was taken to stop the series without hurting it's fans. After watching this part there will be no more fans. According to me this movie should not have got 5.7 rating. I don't know what is happening to IMDb reviews these days.",Resident Evil - Retribution
236,chj915,"too much show-off on action, lack of the essence of Zombie movie",6,22 September 2012,"First, the story should align up with the original game Resident Evil. The movie has its own plot different from the games, but that is OK - still acceptable. Ever since the first Resident Evil movie, the story has gone too far. The 2nd Resident Evil movie was better than the 3rd, 4th, this 5th. The last 3 Resident Evil movies are lack of good story, only full of actions but meaningless fighting. Without zombie, the movie could be recognized ""pure action movie without purpose"".Disappointed but not surprised by this 5th Resident Evil movie. It is still pointless, lack of story, only with show-off actions. I rate it 6 for its ""not bad"" graphics",Resident Evil - Retribution

It's not just fun, it's damn fun! Fans of the games with be happy to see their favorite characters on the big screen and also like the elements it incorporates from the games. If you've played Resident Evil 5, there's a part you'll recognize from the game in the movie.Also Jill Valentine's back(No complaints about that at all)-said in a smooth voice. Along with her there's Michelle Rodriguez who is always welcome.One thing that is also great about this film is the fight choreography which an upgrade over previous installments.

238,JSilk1993,My Review - Resident Evil: Retribution,4,4 October 2012,"Upon my viewing of Resident Evil: Retribution last night, I was left with an action-packed but ultimately hollow experience.Lets start with the pros. Resident Evil has action, some of it is really well executed - especially with regards to choreography of fight scenes and encounters with large monsters where 3D was used quite effectively. The film also has plenty of opportunity to have some interesting battles with hordes of zombies however a lot of the film has ""opportunity"" so that's unfortunately not saying too much.Okay, now the cons. I have more to say here and don't necessarily have to spoil any of the plot. The film feels very isolated, often like a B-movie. It occasionally remembers that Resident Evil began as somewhat of a horror franchise when it projects a jump scare onto the screen but a majority of it just falls flat. The plot begins as a convoluted mess then straightens up and just turns plain average. The acting is fairly awful with the occasional exception of Jovovich demonstrating distance from people yet implying a longing for closeness. The script is cheesy and zombies feel limited in number which is something unusual for a film franchise notorious for having zombies at its core.Overall the film is edited and hollow. That's how I can best describe it. Despite being a zombie/monster film, it's surprisingly clean and fuelled by green screen. Though I'll likely see the sequel in the hope it rounds off well - this film feels like a stand in and just more of the same in the series.4/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
239,lordblacknemp,"I have no idea who this is, but is no longer Resident Evil.",4,16 December 2014,"It can serve to hang out, but by this fifth installment, this saga has been completely distorted. No one turned away is the basic idea that guided the history of the early Resident Evil games, has moved away completely from the basic idea up to the newest in the series deliveries. The history of the previous 4 films leads this have an exaggerated story, with elements that border on the absurd, and the end is still more illogical and absurd. All it does is grab Andersen loose ideas and scenes of Resident Evil video games, and use it completely out of context and place. I can accept without complaint the first two movies, but since the third part, this film saga has gotten worse. This is no longer worthy to be called ""Resident Evil"" because not what the hell is, but beyond loose items, this is no longer even close to being true to the series of games that claims to represent.",Resident Evil - Retribution
240,stravsky,Resident Evil: Rehash,3,2 December 2012,"Slick and stylish graphics couldn't elevate Resident Evil: Retribution above what is in essence a 2 hour platform game that fails to engage the audience beyond its visuals. Even more so than other Resident Evil offerings, this movie's plot carried no great suspense or foreboding. In fact, predicting what was coming next, who would survive and who would be killed off in order to dramatize the potential dangers faced by the main characters, couldn't have been more obvious had they been wearing a Star Trek redshirt.Resident Evil: Retribution did, at least, have a few enjoyable scenes, such as the ones set in American Suburbia. Overall, however, this film felt like a very mild bit of foreplay ahead of the next installment hinted at at the end of this movie. I just hope that one goes off with a bang.

241,dranger-871-224071,Resident Evil : Retribution,1,10 August 2016,"Resident Evil, the first one was the best and till 4 it was still OK to watch, just watch. BUT Retribution was the worst thing I have ever seen in my life! Really, I normally don't critic any movie but this was pure bull manure! No story, no plot, nothing totally NOTHING, just gun shooting in pure nothingness! This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life and I love Resident Evil from game to movie!! Really sorry! But WOW! Never thought this would be like that! They could have made anything after RE 4 but this... there are really no words to explain how bad all of this movie is! Capcom, you should sue the director because he and the whole crew have destroyed the whole name of Resident Evil, destroyed everything in the name of Resident Evil and Umbrella corp. THIS WAS PURE AWFULNESS!!! Can't believe people gave it even a 5 or 6 in stars! This was totally -10 not 1. INCREDIBLE!",Resident Evil - Retribution
242,dabbingonjannies69,Just awful...,1,12 June 2020,Where to even begin? The acting is just terrible. I mean from everyone. Its so forced. There is better acting in porn for christ sake. Basic plot is Alice kills things. That is it. Plus no one reloads their guns. They have infinite ammo guns and superhuman skill to which they never get injured. Watch for comedic value. That's the only thing to take from this film. Its hilarious how bad it is! Would not recommend!,Resident Evil - Retribution
243,jasonvm,Disappointed,5,17 September 2012,"I am left feeling disappointed that such a good opportunity went to waste. Scary? Intense? Anderson blows smoke up everyones ass. There is one jump moment near the beginning in the residential scene, but that's it. No tension. No wondering what's going to happen next. No caring. Just little ideas stolen from other movies that aren't even expanded. The girl, Becky, is snatched by the Huge Licker and Alice has to rescue her from an egg sack, which is similar to Aliens? That is such a cop-out of originality. I have great memories of playing the games. Loved RE4 (the game), where there is a feeling of horror survival. That is gone from these movies. Anderson really dropped the ball on this one. But at least he and his wife Milla will make millions. What an embarrassment. It didn't even feel like an R rated movie.The Good: Action from the beginning until the Russian scene. Music. Special Effects were good for me. The sets were great.The Bad: Story. Dialogue. The only attempt at dialog was the residential scene where Milla plays housewife. Dawn of the Dead was far way better, but the movie kept my interest until I gave up on it during the Russian scene. I see Barry and Leon just standing in the open of the department store firing at the Russian zombie soldiers, who have way more fire power, and there's no realism. I completely just felt let down when I saw Barry (who should of had a back-story, poor use of Kevin Durand) holds a zombie from behind while Leon shoots at it with an automatic weapon from the front, then Barry just tosses it. Really? Come on! No realism or thought behind the action. I was so looking forward to seeing Russian zombies with chainsaws on bikes. That image was in my head, but so was the idea that it would actually be in Russia. There was no world feel or substance. Over use of flying gun clips and guns and slow-mo bullets. OK, I can live with that stuff. But when a movie like this, which Milla and Paul promised was for the fans best interest, goes absolutely nowhere, all I feel is nothing for this waste.To salvage what's there, this should've been the third installment, since it takes place in one locale and has no drive on a ""global"" scale that is repeatedly plastered on the movie posters. I understand they will make more money internationally, so that's why it says global to appeal to foreign markets, but it doesn't have that global feel whatsoever. Why not simply change the story by having Alice escape the Umbrella underwater facility (which looked good) chase Jill or Wesker around the globe going to Tokyo, New York, Moscow, and Washington, D.C. I really believed that was the premise of the movie prior to actually seeing it. Don't duplicate the hive feeling again. Don't retread.I understand Anderson wanted to bring some of the older characters back, and the cloning idea is fine. But it didn't go anywhere. There is a detail on the first movie DVD that comes to mind. Anderson narrates on the alternate ending clip, and says Milla was going to walk into Umbrella, whip out a big gun and fire. Then multiple little missiles were going to fly at you. That's it. (That majestic idea must've really excited Anderson so bad he just had to put it in RE5 with Rodriguez firing that same weapon. Boring!) What changed everything about the feel of the first RE was re-shooting the ending with Milla standing in the street of a ravaged Raccoon City holding a shotgun as the camera pulled back. Very good! Whoever suggested that ending shaped the future for this franchise. Unfortunately, Anderson must not have those inspirational people around him anymore to ""borrow"" from, so we fans get this sloppy piece of non scary shi*! If you are reading most of the reviews out of curiosity like i did, you'll realize that this movie was a terrible mistake. of course, seeing is believing. I can bet when you leave the theater, you'll feel like this was just a big piece of regurgitated trite that you've seen before and are tired of seeing. I didn't read any reviews on IMDb until after watching it because I know the history of fans and their polarizing feel for Anderson's direction. I always gave him the benefit of the doubt since all the RE movies had some high points and were entertaining at the very least. But not anymore. I wanted to know if others felt the same way. I wished there was some way to get the movie a reboot, because this so called story line has finally lost me. I will no longer talk about how much I like Resident Evil. I'm embarrassed to. The last game I played was RE4 back in 2007, and I don't play video games like I used to anymore. But to remember the feeling of playing the very first game around 1997, the feeling of being scared. The feeling of intensity. The feeling of wanting to relive it again is fond. It's only been a couple of days since seeing Retribution, and I have no feelings at all for it.Capcom, please take control of your creation and say good-bye to Anderson. Let's get a reboot now!",Resident Evil - Retribution
244,sonybacker,I would make better movie with few dollars on my hand,3,6 December 2012,"From the first seconds of movie starts unknown chaos with no story. Mila is running around some unreal cities and fighting god knows who. Fighting scenes is boring, seen it before and many times. I do not know how actors can join in movie like this, probably an only because of money. I could not even watch this movie to the end. Cheap and dull movie (I just called it movie but had to used other word inside my mind). For a well know producer it is shame to release movie like this. It is really a shame. I think only RE1 and RE4 were good others were trash. Even if you watch this movie to the end you not gonna be able to remember what happened here. I would better look in to the wall for hour and half but not watch this.",Resident Evil - Retribution

But, to my astonishing surprise, this one was just another mediocre movie especially in terms of story line. It seemed as if the producers are out of idea and that they have this obligation to exactly following the game without adding any novel ideas to it.Taking into consideration that I am a fan of the whole series including the games, I am giving it 3 stars.

Casting: Awful.Story: Even more confusing and AWFULRelation to the ACTUAL RE series: Not there at all. You can't just add in Character names and hope that fans will be happy. Leon's name could've been Steve and it would have made NO difference to me...no development. AT. ALL. I'm sure that last movie is going to be, literally, 90 minutes of constant DUBSTEP and Fighting...which will make me feel exactly how Alice did in that STUPID holding cell. The only thing I'm very happy about is that the next movie will be the LAST by Paul Anderson. Thank God.",Resident Evil - Retribution
247,mozohu,Filler!,4,23 January 2013,"Now even without spoilers I can describe this whole movie perfectly with only one word: FILLER. Simple as that: Nothing happens. Nothing progresses. Especially nothing advances! And even for a filler, a filler could at least have a good story of its own, even if it doesn't connect with the main storyline. Here I can't even say the story is bad, because there is no story at all. They didn't even try.But we have good effects and plenty of action at least. And that's the whole point I guess: They just needed some empty space to dump them into, and sell it in cinemas. Though those effects are just wasted on this movie, still can be watched once if they are there anyway, but just expect nothing else.",Resident Evil - Retribution
248,ghizmooo,Loved the previous one this was just OK,6,27 September 2012,"*** SPOILER ALERT****. Mixed feelings about this movie. I'm a HUGE fan of the entire series and absolutely loved the previous one. I had been waiting for this movie for a whole year and literally counting down the days but I'm sadly a bit disappointed. In this last chapter some scenes were really cool, especially the opening sequence when she was the trapped in the house, that's what Resident Evil is about.. But overall it felt more like a war movie than Resident Evil : too many gun fights and not enough zombies. I felt like the plot was weak and it was just a movie to set up the next chapter of the series. ('cause from the ending there has to be another one, right?) I didn't like the way they brought back some of the old characters just for the sake of it and the fact that Alice teams up with Albert Wesker and you just have to accept it. And also the Red Queen controlling Umbrella sounds just silly..how and when did it happen? Another thing you just have to accept. Also Alice looks more and more like Selene from Underworld. They should have escaped the Russian facility after 30 mins and the movie should have focused on what happens next but..hopefully the next one? As a massive fan I really hope the next movie will be out soon and it will go back to the origins of the franchise.",Resident Evil - Retribution
249,orst,Great opening sequence and arguably the best sequel in the series,9,30 September 2012,The opening sequence where the credits are shown was just amazing. I felt that I was in a for a cinematic treat and I was not disappointed. I haven't written a review for some time but I think this sequel really deserved it and I don't understand all the very critical reviews this movie has received. The idea of using cloned characters (don't want to give anything away) was taken to the next level here and all in all a great script and great directing. Acting by Milla Jovovich was excellent. I could not expect more from a Resident Evil sequence. I'm happy to wait another 2 years if the next sequel will be of the same quality.,Resident Evil - Retribution
250,DeborahJean,The Best of this Series,10,15 September 2012,"As the title states, I feel this installment of Resident evil far surpassed the others. Great story line, awesome on the edge of your seat fight scenes. The action in this is pretty well from start to finish, there aren't very many gaps in between action scenes, so that was a plus for me. So glad I chose to watch Retribution in the theater my first time, and yes, I said first time because I plan on watching it many times over. Great performances by the entire cast. Milla Jovovich never fails to impress me, I was very pleased with her performance in this one. Michelle Rodriguez is another. She did an outstanding job. Definitely a must see, and if you can, try to catch it in the theater because the action scenes in this film are well worth seeing on the big screen.",Resident Evil - Retribution
251,ashava-73-276707,Its not supposed to be Shawshank Redemption !!,10,3 October 2012,"I think one thing that has plagued the RE movies and any video game movies that get made for that matter is the fact that people will go to see them who have no prior knowledge of the games and what RE universe entails. Yes the film has cheesy moments and the acting isn't on a level with say Marlon Brando but honestly who cares !?!? This like all the other RE movies are kick-ass rides involving loads of guns ! beautiful women ! zombies and monsters ! I knew exactly what to expect with RE:R and I loved it, and its my film of the year ! and yes I saw the Dark Knight..10/10 isn't exactly what I would score the movie (more like 8-9) but I think there's so many morbid people out there that score films like this so low its unfair. I look forward to the next RE movie ! now back to playing RE6.. :)",Resident Evil - Retribution

But just think about the fact that I actually had to pay to see this film which almost drove me crazy. How is slow motion becoming so fascinating for the director? How long would this film be if we modestly return just some of the scenes back to normal tempo? Since the last episode was this problem already obvious enough, and we should probably see a ""in slow motion"" sign next to the film title if we use a microscope. Besides, the repetition and sudden change of music can seriously cause mental damage, I wonder what happened during the editing of the last part of the movie, what happened to the music?! I'd rather have that part mute.",Resident Evil - Retribution
253,edwardsb704,Awesome movie!!!!,10,18 September 2012,"The Movie was AWESOME. But they left a lot of holes in the plot as how on earth did Wesker become the self made President of the USA? Why is the Red Queen against Wesker and why is Wesker helping the humans? I thought he wanted a mutated world...And last, but not the least, Maggie Q would have done a better job as Ada Wong. Not that Li Bing Bing didn't do a good job. But there's something about Maggie Q taking on ass kicking roles. It just brings, life into that character.IMHO, out of all 5 RE movies i will rate this as the 4th best. 1st being RE:Afterlife, 2nd Resident Evil, 3 RE:Apocalypse and the last RE:Extinction.",Resident Evil - Retribution
254,louhefner123,Contains Spoilers....... Smh disappointed,4,17 September 2012,"I was very disappointed with this movie, great idea, but bad execution. First off, I am a big fan of the video games back when they arrived on playstation. I understand that they are different from them which in my opinion makes them alittle weak but still good to watch. Barry was awesome as in the video game up until he died. Which was very cheesy might i add. Leon was OK as in the video games, and wesker is always awesome, BUT in this movie he needs Alice's help WHY???!!!! i do not know because wesker can pretty much destroy any zombie that crosses his path, and what made me upset was they make a big deal outta needing Alice when clearly wesker is the s@#t. Ada wong and Jill Valentine was good. The place setting was weak, meaning that whole tesing facility was wack. Another problem is that wesker gave Alice her powers back so she can help restore the human race from the outbreak. BUT reports were that if another RE movie was made it would be based on Chris and Claire.... whom were captured by umbrella. Now if that the case we need two more movies, one explaining there sudden absence in this one and the final one where wesker, alice, leon, jill and others restore humanity by killing every zombie on earth. Sounds great doesn't it??? but thats why It makes me upset cause its something they wont do...",Resident Evil - Retribution

Knew of the video game but never played any of them so I had no route I was expecting them to follow, just went in to be entertained & have been there opening weekends ever since ! The 3-D was used very well, not a zillion things constantly flying at you, but when they did it was Awesome. The action scenes did not disappoint ! Even without her powers Alice was still a force to be reckoned with . Be it with Bada** guns or just her body , Umbrella was going to have to bring All it had to take her & her crew down! Loved the bringing back of familiar characters, but hated you know who was on the other side this time. : ( Love the fact that the females are the lead bada**es & don't hide in a corner waiting for someone to rescue them ! Yeah at times the situations are unreal , but hey people it's a Movie , it's meant as an escape from the ""real world "" ! So if you want a mind numbing , action packed ride see it & hold on tight !

256,Douglobacki,Great for zombie lovers,7,15 September 2012,"If you like zombie movies you will like this movie. If you just like action you will most likely like this movie. If you like neither action or zombies do not see this movie.The bad: The acting is on par for most major charters, but for minor charters the acting is sub par; it's not horrible or bad just not good. I would give the overall acing a: ""meh"". The plot is okay for a zombie movie though it does have a few things and leaves something to be desired. The script can be cheesy at times but its nothing that would make me not like the movie. The action was never bad but it was standard for non-realistic movies; the bullets never ran out unless the script called for it and even though there was some cool flips/kicks I did feel like I wanted more.The good: The CGI is great giving a bonus to the movie. I am zombie fan so I enjoyed all of the undead, there where not many just regular undead people mostly mutated monsters though. The action had a few good parts, some cool face kicks and heart stopping ""palm thrusts"". There wasn't anything amazing bout the film I can think of except for the CGI, most of it was just okay. Bottom line: as I said before if you like zombies you will like this movie. Zombie movies are rare, there are tons of horrible movies about zombies but those are just no fun to watch. If you're like me and a fan of these movies you will understand that an ""okay"" zombie film is a ""great"" zombie film because of the rarity. A ""great"" zombie film is a ""classic"" zombie film. Because of the scarcity of these movies anything that is watchable becomes enjoyable. This movie is absolutely an okay film id say even a good film which in the zombie lover world makes it a great film to watch so all zombie lovers GO SEE THIS FILM. If you are looking for an action flick this movie could go both ways, the action is decent and almost constant but if you are not interested in zombies, well that's what the movie is all about so I am not sure what to say to you. And again if you neither like zombies nor action and are just looking for a film to watch don't see this film. There are a few bad parts but I expected those knowing the Resident Evil franchise, and a few good parts since it was a big budget picture but mostly everything was just plain old okay. I enjoyed it and wished it was longer but again I'm a zombie fan. I'm giving it a 7 because I think a 6 is too low, but a 7 is too high. 6.5 would be perfect.TL;DR: Zombie fans: Yes. Action fans: Maybe. Neither: No.",Resident Evil - Retribution

As you would imagine some have out done the others. After watching Afterlife, it had my Res E juices flowing again as it had impressive action sequences with new ideas.Retribution - started out really cool Loving the slow mo reverse action as the opening credits rolled, although as cool as this was I felt it lingered a little too long and lost a little credibility.Overall I was disappointed with the movie as a whole, some of the action seemed a little tired but on a positive note they did gain the computer game feel with the zone by zone stage by stage escape route.Although i feel this one missed the mark slightly, they have most definitely left it open for a final movie so lets hope they rekindle the coolness that has dampened.all in all an entertaining watch but nothing to shout about.",Resident Evil - Retribution
258,industrija666,Absolutely ridiculous,3,13 September 2012,"After a major insult by Paul Anderson's latest, ""RESIDENT EVIL: Retribution"", there's a few words I must say about it. This could be Anderson's worst, perhaps even worse than the mega-flop ""AVP"". It's a no-brainer, but not a good-to-enjoy no-brainer. It's simply so terribly bad and poorly written, it could easily be compared to some of Uwe Boll's worst. Not to mention the constant and ongoing Paul's masturbation over Jovovich in tight outfits shot in irritating slow-mo, the OVER-THE-TOP-BAD plot. To make things worse, the CG/green-screen scenes are ridiculous, even more than usual. The fourth film installment is actually watchable compared to this one. And I'm not even overreacting. Oh....and Jill Valentine's character seemed to have bigger breasts in the second film. I literally yelled ""NO,F****** GOD NO"", when I saw the ending. Paul Anderson was sometimes a dirty pleasure for me. But not anymore.",Resident Evil - Retribution
259,phunnyconflicts,The new Uwe Boll?,1,12 February 2013,"Every time Paul W.S. Anderson releases a movie, its just more worse than the last one. Retribution however was not only worse than the last, but has sank to the Uwe Boll Level. Only difference between them two is that Anderson can still afford slightly better CGI than Uwe Boll and still have somewhat famous actors and actress who is willing to work under him.Other than that, his movies, especially the RE series, is just going down the crapper. Each iterations is just worse than the last with no improvement or no attempts to even try to make the movie half decent. It's quit embarrassing and he should really reconsider the direction he is going in.The way I see it is, since he has the ability to make big screen motion pictures, why not make actually good movie instead of half-ass'd product? Time, money, and talent is wasted if you asked me. it could of been so much better if he just tried...",Resident Evil - Retribution

I've seen all the previous Resident Evil movies and I say, it's as 'good' as the one's before, if not better.Visual effects,that I did not see from the previous ones, were very impressive.All in all, 8 out of 10, just because the action was so damn awesome. Very fun,and great movie with very good' special effects'. This is a pure action SCI-FI movie, not a drama! To those who reviewed it negatively, If you are confused, then probably the RE movie franchise isn't for you. To those thinking of renting it, don't listen to these 'stupid' reviews. See it for yourself and decide for yourself, as I did. Don't let this 'experts'(not) decide for you...Again, This is a pure action SCI-fi movie, not a drama!",Resident Evil - Retribution

However, I've really enjoyed 'em - the franchise has been great movie fun with each offering a different angle on the spread of Umbrella's T-Virus. That said, this one was quite horrible! A very 1980s plot, super-clunky script, some ropey effects... And I'm pretty sure I caught a couple of recycled shots. Not to mention really average use of 3D. To me this one was saved only by Milla Jovovich's hotness and some pretty cool action sequences. But the essence of RE, for me, is lost completely in a mess of retro technology and a basic lack of story development since Afterlife. Bring back the claustrophobia, the zombies and the scares! Chuck out the underwater training simulation stations and the red queen regurgitating silly lines! I'm done.",Resident Evil - Retribution

This movie is no worse than the past two or three RE movies that have come out, which admittedly were pretty awful. I actually found this one slightly more entertaining. I thought the acting was on par with previous RE films (take that as you will), except for the actress that played Jill Valentine, whose ham-handed line delivery stunk up the movie. Of course the plot wasn't anything groundbreaking (or all that interesting), but how is this different than any of the other RE movies we've seen since the first one? The premise has always pretty much been the same: Mila Jovovich gets in a hot outfit and lays the beatdown on zombies. You want depth, go rent Doctor Zhivago. You want auteurism, watch some Fellini. This is a very simple formula for a very simple franchise: hot chick, shoots guns, kills stuff. Are you really complaining about the realism of a movie inspired by a video game about mutant zombies? Take this movie franchise for what it is intended to be, and maybe you won't wet your pants with shock and disappointment when the next installment inevitably comes out.",Resident Evil - Retribution

After seeing all the horrid reviews I had to speak up.Finally a video game movie that feels like your watching a video game. The first four ""Resident Evil"" movies were more of a traditional type (A story inspired by characters and events from a video game). This one goes a different route and is more like watching an automated video game with the characters of the previous movies. I don't need complicated plot lines, character arcs or a believable story to be entertained. Personally, I could watch Alice (Milla Jovovich), Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) & Ada Wong (Bingbing Li) kick butt video game style for 12 hours straight. But maybe that's just me. I'm the kind of guy that watches an entire season of ""24"" on my one day off. I own the first four ""Resident Evil"" DVDs and after renting ""Retribution"" I'll be buying it too.I'll sum it it with the fact that I really enjoyed this movie. No, the movie isn't thought provoking, a social commentary or an exploration into the human psyche. It just get's Alice through another day.",Resident Evil - Retribution
265,sol-o_guest,This was so weird and I'm so disappointed,5,15 September 2012,"I was wondering if Anderson was drunk when he wrote the screenplay, because all the movie is a complete contradiction itself; I don't get the idea... Why I'm saying this?, because this movie violate all the saga. First the computer in the first movie and then in the third one tried to help people; yes, it was killing people in the first one but just because it (the red queen) needed to be sure that the T-virus didn't escape of the facility lab. Indifferently of this, wasn't the red queen shut down?Second I think it was a BIG mistake putting Wesker as good man now, after he tried to kill Alice and everybody all the time like in the ship with the bomb... And obviously WHY he put Alice's powers out and now he's returning them back. For me, all this is illogical, you can NOT just convert or turn the bad guy that was the last 2 movies being a shi** with everyone into a good one just for pleasure... And why is he alive if we saw him exploding in the 4th part?The crew was so good, but the director didn't make good use of it. They don't really say us what is happening, who is this people we have seen in the first movie as good ones, now trying to kill Alice...I'm expecting always for a good reason why this things happened but they didn't give us any. They were just clones and some are goods and others not.I'm fan of RE but I don't know what is happening with this people; the movie hasn't heart, has a lot of incredible effects and the fights were awesome but for me it needed something more, more plot, participation of main characters like Leon etc.My opinion about this movie is the director hadn't a screenplay, first of all, second he wanted to put in the movie main characters of the video game but these hadn't any story, they were there just for rescue Alice, without any other explanation. Other thing with this was, what happened with Claire, Chris and K-mark? they were just put out of the movie... I don't know but for me the movie was needed of organization, explanations, and a good screenplay because they didn't give me anything new, was just bullets, kicks, and more bullets, here's no story just odds and ends (characters of the VG, ideas of others movies like the clones etc) joined.For me, it was a bit disappointing I was expecting something better this time but with Anderson as director at the same time I knew this couldn't be a good movie...",Resident Evil - Retribution
266,LisaFace,Accidentally brilliant,5,2 September 2014,"This is hands down one of the worst films that has ever been made. And that's exactly what makes it so good to watch. It's so bad its good. Here is what happens in Resident Evil Retribution: You will have no idea whats going on throughout the entire movie. There are bizarre plot lines all over the place that have no relevance. Characters appear, die, come back, die again, good guy, bad guy, good guy again, die again(you get the idea). The casting director could have used a cardboard cut out of Ava Wong and it would have had more personality. They're in a soviet submarine base under the ice in Russia. There's a deaf kid. The acting is so crap it's hilarious. Zombies (Nazi zombies no less) can now ride bikes and drive cars. Leon S Kennedy is in it with no reference to why he's there or who he is. Look Barry Burton is here too with his magnum and cigar! Everything blows up. The guns never run out of ammunition. Confused yet? Good. That's the idea. There are really hot chicks in skin tight leather kicking each other. Hooray! Where did Claire et al. on the ship at the end of the last film go? Who cares!

But this film, is a complete and utter insult to every single fan of the RE games. And Movies for that matter. Not only does is not have a single trace of a plot, but it each character must have around five lines throughout the incredibly short film. Also, the lack of zombies after the first twenty minutes is ridiculous - heck, isn't that what the whole thing is about? A Virus that turns people into hungry, flesh eating monsters, whilst the remaining survivors, police and military crew battle it out against them? Not this film. One very annoying thing about it was that the characters would carry out hard core fighting scenes (which are actually brilliant by the way) with numerous broken bones (ribs, arm bones, leg bones, the lot) - now surely this is a minor catch? On the bright side, the action shots were indeed brilliant and so were the first twenty minutes of the film - taking us back to a suburbia horror-zombie feel, it was very enjoyable but very scary indeed. So if you like action, some zombies and a lot of gun shots, then this is the film for you.",Resident Evil - Retribution
269,imnlacey,Aesthetic Wizardry at its Best,7,27 September 2012,"I should start off this article by first confessing that I am a Resident Evil fan.Although largely loathed by critics, I have to admit I have always had a soft spot for the franchise, partly because of my love of the games when I was younger and partly because of my love of zombie films.Being the fifth movie in the series, it was always likely that Resident Evil: Retribution would struggle to deliver a fresh perspective on the zombie-laden franchise.Ten minutes in and I was beginning to change my mind.The opening scene of Retribution is a masterclass in aesthetic wizardry, picking up right where the last movie left off it wastes no time in diving headfirst into the action.Much like the previous Resident Evil movie, Retribution utilises slow- motion visuals intertwined with fast cuts and high-paced action scenes to create a visual feast from start to finish.For those who have no problem putting their logical thought process on standby for 90 minutes and enjoy a series of action-fuelled, suspense- filled scenes, this movie has a lot to offer.Resident Evil: Retribution sees Milla Jovovich reprise her role as Alice, once again donning the skintight outfits she has become accustomed to from previous instalments in the series.The introduction of a daughter plays as an attempt to give Alice a more three dimensional emotive scope, though this attempt is never fully realised and isn't particularly necessary, as it is Alice's hard-headed nature which is one of the most appealing aspects of her character.A series of other new characters are also introduced along with former characters returning to the franchise for cameo roles.Fans of the video game will be pleased to see the addition of Leon Kennedy, though he is played by a mediocre Johann Urb and thankfully doesn't end up with too much screen time.After seeing the previous Resident Evil movie in 3D (and considering it well worth it) I made a point of seeing this one in 3D also, however, as far as Retribution goes, I would recommend passing on 3D and saving yourself the extra money.Overall I found Resident Evil: Retribution to be very enjoyable, though what disappointed me most about it was the writing.The plot struggled to hold momentum throughout and the dialogue left a lot to be desired at times, both in writing and delivery.I would have liked to have seen more zombie hybrid characters introduced also, as most of the zombies present in the film have already appeared in previous instalments in the franchise.However, with a title like Resident Evil it should already be apparent this film is by no means a masterpiece.But then again, it isn't trying to be.What the Resident Evil franchise aims to do is deliver mindless entertainment from start to finish, and on this front it delivers.",Resident Evil - Retribution

272,dieterperras,the worst so far,5,21 September 2012,"resident evil retribution. Now I haven't played much of the games and haven't seen the movies a lot but even so this movie bugged me. First off I'd like to say that all those RE fans out there who say that anyone who hasn't played resident evil four thousand times and doesn't have a chart detailing its plot has no business rating the movies are morons. Now with that aside I can actually go into the movie a bit. The special effects were awesome, and the sound track matched it beautifully as well as the action scenes being very well done but that's not why I've put it down as the worst Resident Evil movie out there. As stories go this ones about as weak as a sparrow with brittle bone disease. Apparently the writers have figured out that no human in their right mind would look at what's happening and go ""Yep, this can't possible go badly for me at all!"" So they've had to bring back the red queen from the first movie to be the big baddie but hold on! Wasn't the red queen supposed to be trying to contain the virus in the first movie? Wasn't she portrayed as just misguided? Wered this sudden blood lust come from? And it goes completely unexplained as to why, the film seemingly preferring to try and distract viewers with more bright explosions. The other ""big twist"" is that umbrella mass clones people but hold on again! How did that get overlooked! I mean that would make for one awkward scene in the umbrella soldiers locker room surely! Giving an excuse for those soldiers from the first movie to make an appearance as umbrella soldiers and rather then them getting shot its the guards wearing masks that do. But then the whole place floods in the next scene killing them all, so how much would it have changed anything for even one of them to have died before hand?Another thing that annoyed me was when the zombie soldiers showed up in Moscow. I mean come on! I can accept zombies with guns but zombies with guns on motorcycles? That's just too far...There's also a part in the movie where a giant monster grabs a little girl but rather then instantly killing her like it has every other person its even come near to it decides to take her back to its den so alice can go save her, I think that pathetic attempt at story line speaks for itself...In short resident evil retribution is good for mindless shooty,zombie killing,exploisiony fun. just don't expect anything else or you'll be disappointed.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I thought the last one was really good, and was excited for it because I figured the conclusion was coming, and there would be another fight with Wesker. Slight spoilerThere is no big fight with Wesker. Basically the story line that they built in the last movie was scraped, and this movie turns the series into more of a terminator like franchise.What I did like about it, is that there are a few more references to the game in this one, but still not many. You see a zombie in a closet, like the first game, and Barry's hand cannon.

Sequels (SOME remakes & reboots, too) just for the sake of making sequels have to stop. They're (almost) always terrible. And before anyone mentions 'The Godfather II' or 'Aliens', those were released over 25 years ago - let it go, FFS. This movie just seemed like an excuse to reunite cast members from the first film (for the weakest of reasons), and also to have many, many unnecessary fight scenes that never end. The film's first, second & third acts don't really seem to even come from the same storyline and the film's plot is all over the place. Also, I'm not quite sure how much longer the audience will continue to believe that these specially-trained, martial arts & combat experts (as they all seems to be) can barely hit a single target while shooting at another main character. If you're going to waste your money, spend it on the video games instead.",Resident Evil - Retribution

We were playing the game, waiting for an animation, cinematic scene to show to enjoy watching it. Now that we have a complete real life movie, you would complain? In contract to other movies, the more they release the better it gets. I liked the last 2 movies (after life & retribution) more than the 3 previous ones. More familiar faces, characters were introduced and the intensity of the action has increased. I did not realized those 2 movies were done while watching until i saw the ending already!

Right along with Prometheus, Hollywood continues to make films to stare at but not watch. There are so many ridiculous plot holes and cheesy lines that it's more like a Schwarzenegger flick from the 90's than anything worth putting on film today.

280,Phlebotinum87,What. Was. That?,1,16 September 2012,"I have just finished watching the fifth installment in the Resident Evil series with my house-mates after getting psyched for the next bought of cameos, action sequences and a view into the ever popular theme of 'Zombie Apocalypse'. I've come away not only feeling robbed of the overpriced 3D glasses, but confused and angry, much like fat kid with no jelly. The movie opens with a fantastic sequence including a slow motion rewind of the fallout from when the Umbrella Corporation located our hero (Alice) aboard the supposed safe zone, a ship called Arcadia. After watching the battle unfold, including the first (of what soon becomes tiresomely many) Tom and Jerry-like showdowns between Jovovich and Guillory (Valentine), the audience is treated to several relayed shots of action scenes from the previous movies, all of which is conveniently explained by Alices latest unkillable female friend, Ada Wong (Bingbing Li). Helping the ladies escape are a team of male characters, some referencing previous movies (Boris Kodjoe as Luther West) and some as a nod to the original video games (John Uurb as Leon Kennedy) What follows is two hours worth of unfinished plots, confusing references, sudden appearances of cast members playing multiple parts (Good Rodriguez, Bad Rodriguez) and more stock henchmen, some of which are undead Nazis (yes, really). Large scale battle scenes take place in famous cities like Moscow and New York while the invincible ladies and their male friends (who get shot, but thats okay. 'Cause they're MEN) stumble closer together to finally make their way out of the newest Umbrella base, which is of course located in Russia. Underwater. And ice. And there's submarines. Confused? Good. So after a lovely Dawn of the Dead Esq scene that takes place just after the credits, Alice and Wong find themselves discovering a clone child, who thinks Alice is her mum. Alice decides to keep her brand new clone child, because, your face, thats why. The addition of a sudden maternal bond from the erstwhile stone cold undead killing machine feels out of place, so much so that the wooden interactions between the cast from that point on tells us that even the characters simply aren't buying it. The whole movie plays out uncomfortably, somewhere between seeing a train crash and hearing an old lady try to muffle a queef with her handbag. I strongly advise you to wait for DVD.",Resident Evil - Retribution
281,goldenartsonline,Is it really that bad?,6,1 December 2012,"There really isn't much to say about this movie in all honesty.Its the worst of them all, and the story line is nonexistent.But is it really that bad? Both yes and no.Most RE fans will watch this movie regardless if had 0.1 out 10. Most of you will actually enjoy the 1.5 hour of entertainment if offers you.However, it is hard to actually explain why this is so bad.The characters are disappointing ( except Ada Wong ) The story line is disappointing.However, the VFX is by todays standard quite amazing, and thats the main reason you go see this movie, well, and to follow the ""story""The action however, gets stupid many times, thats why the effects sometime feels like a waste of space and time.6/10 is probably to high tbh, but I'm speaking mainly for the fans of the RE genre, and if you really think back after watching this movie you find out that the story really isn't that bad.So why is it so bad yet it isn't?The problem occurs here when the very very bad of music, effects, action, acting, story etc-etc gets mixed up with some of the very well made moments of the movie, you don't know what the hell to say about it at all and just finds everything confusing.What bothers me most personally is all the unrealistic moments that occurs with movies like this tho.For example: When the bad guys always miss with their weapons, people scream just to reveal themselves, or when the bioweapons activated by the red queen have spikes trough their entire body and a big bag around their face can see everything around them and have to carry a big axe as weapon instead of just using a super-big mini-gun with thousands of bullets. I guess there's a random reason for that as well ( after all they are inside umbrella and they control the entire environment )Or... when they never go out of bullets, yet they are almost completely naked.This is what you have to take tho, so many movies made loads of these big mistake's that they are commonly accepted probably.Eaither way, the movie is worth watching for the end only tho, I promise.Golden Arts scores this movie a 6/10. Its not worth paying for IMO, still worth watching when you have time to kill.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Way to kill the movie series, Mr Anderson....",1,2 January 2013,"Well, it seems this movie was made just to cash in as much as possible from all of us, lovers of the Resident Evil franchise (games and/or movies). After the cliffhanger of the last movie, most of me and my friends and colleagues who love a good action/horror movie were interested to see how Alice could escape the predicament that was falling upon her. If you've seen the other movies of the series, you expect a certain form of quality of this latest installment. DO NOT WATCH IT... Clones, clones, clones... yada yada yada... Even the action in the movie turns dull after 15 minutes in. No story, dumb action, lame clones (oh, did i already mention the clones ??). If this ever one gets released to DVD (God forbid), don't bother until it gets into those nice sell-out baskets for one dollar or euro... and that's event stretching it !

Not necessarily for the right reasons though...So, the plot (which is pretty thin, but at least not clichéd) Long, ridiculously long backwards sequence which is repeated later in the film and hence serves no plot or speed device. Woot! After Resident Evil Afterlife, Alice has been caught by Umbrella, and somehow Wesker is a good guy? No idea why, but hey. There is a sequence where clones of popular characters appear as a zombie invasion occurs. Milla Jovovich has a daughter now. who she keeps throughout the film. And Ada Wong is going to help Alice escape with Wesker, with Luther, Barry Burton, Leon S Kennedy and two other characters who we don't need to care about as they weren't in the title sequence and die pretty soon after (that was a kind-of spoiler by the way. As was good Wesker. Sorry). So, they go around blowing up stuff. And fighting zombies. And fighting evil clones who work for Umbrella, under the guard of Jill Valentine (who has the weird spider thing on her). People die, zombies die, Michele Rodriguez is yet again amazing (she is underrated for her versatility in my opinion) as she plays good and evil, and Colin Salmon is underused. (Spoiler here) and why did they kill Luther?! Sad times. Despite a few silly things, you can sit through it and enjoy it. It may not be scary, but it has Michele Rodriguez in it so it is instantly 10 times better. And there is an interesting future for the series...P.S. there is an extra bit of good news.

Despite the fact that the films do not follow the exact plot of the video games, they still contain plenty of the characters, monsters and elements of the video games, much to the delight of fans like myself, especially the first appearance of my favorite character from the video games, Leon Kennedy. I recommend this for movie goers who enjoy the occasional random action film and for the fans of the video game series. A fantastic reverse intro sequence and plenty of action.",Resident Evil - Retribution
285,gfs555,"Great, just missing 3 characters...",8,14 September 2012,"After 4 movies, it is pretty obvious that plot and story will be secondary in the 5th entry. With this thought in mind I went to see RE5 today.The bad things about the movie are the expected ones (lack of plot, lots of plot holes and unexplained situations, not so good acting, etc.), but I think the worst was to continue the story directly from the end of the last movie and not even show 3 of the main characters of the last scene of the previous movie.Now the good things about this movie were the action scenes. the non-stop action of the movie also made me pay much attention and not notice the time pass. comparing the 3D and slow-mo with RE4, I think this movie had less, but it was used in a better way. For example there is a scene Alice shoots the head of a zombie directly in front of the camera, and the effect is that blood splatters in the camera, in 3D!!! It was much better than the ""let's do a 3D movie just because it should look good"" feel of the last movie. Also the beginning of the movie was, although a loss of time, as original as it could get. I think it was a great idea to play the credits in slow-mo reverse and later play the same scene straight.The best things about the movie though, I thought it was the music and the homage to all games and movies. as in RE4, the score matches the action of the scene, like a fast pace when action is going on regular time, and slowing together with the slow-mo of the scene. the use of RE4 music for the reenactment of that movie's scene was also a good idea, because increases the deja vu feeling.all in all, 8 out of 10. plot and story are N/A for this movie, so the score is high just because of the fun. missed the 9 because missed some characters.",Resident Evil - Retribution
286,JordanPage1988,Resident Evil Enters the Schumacher Era,4,19 September 2012,"It's safe to say, however, that the Resident Evil franchise has stepped into the Schumacher era of its overlong lifespan. Alice may not be sporting rubber nipples on her suit, but the entire film had its own metaphysical rubber nipples popping out left and right. The first rubber nipple is during the intro in which Milla Jovovich speaks to the camera and explains all the events from the previous films (at least in Apocalypse that made sense, because toward the end of the film we saw that she talked to a camcorder); then the film essentially starts straight to the Dawn of the Dead rip-off, which Alice wakes up in a suburban house with a mute daughter (that speaks just fine) and husband Carlos Olivera (what?!) and then Carlos gets bit, oh no, and it's so blatantly obvious that the film is copying Dawn that I expected to see Ving Rhames dressed as a cop and say the same exact lines he said to Sarah Polley; then, what these not-quite-literal rubber nipples made me giggle the most was all the copy and pasted elements from the video game franchise that has no rhyme or reason to even be in the film. For instance, the zombies now have mouths like the majini from Resident Evil 5—you know, the mouths which CAPCOM clearly took from Guillermo del Toro's Blade 2 and made them not as scary; yeah, those mouths—and in Retribution, I finally thought that Anderson actually was about to make sense of something every fan of the video game franchise was confused about. The Red Queen told us—yes, literally, she talks to the camera too (Alice isn't the only one)—that she was initiating the Las Plagas Undead. In my mind, I thought, Yes, finally he's explaining why the zombies have become fast with majini-mouths. But, really . . . it was his excuse to have zombies with guns and chainsaws (but why wield a chainsaw if you can use a gun?), that could ride motorcycles and shoot guns at the same time—if that's a spoiler, it's a spoiler best known upfront. This isn't scary; this is outrageously funny. What also doesn't make sense is the fact that the Umbrella Corporation currently manufactures the Executioners from Resident Evil 5 and meticulously hammers in each nail in their heads and shoulders just for theatrics—if it didn't make sense in RE5, it's definitely going to be a laugh riot in Retribution. Which it was. But even funnier yet, while Alice was fighting Jill, and Luther (didn't he die in Afterlife? I swear he did) and Leon were fighting the evil Las Plagas-infected Rain (I was expecting her to become a giant sea monster like Irving in RE5), I thought to myself, Paul might make terrible Resident Evil films, but he might make a good Mortal Kombat film . . . then I realized he already did . . . and it was terrible.What Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't seem to understand is that copying moments and characters from the games and pasting them into the films isn't working. Fan boys are going to pick out the illogical inclusion of the characters, like I am right now; and people who aren't fans of the games aren't going to care if Leon is in the film or not. At this point, however, I think Paul W.S. Anderson knows how terrible the films are, and he's taking advantage of it—bringing characters back to life just for giggles, having hilariously cheesy dialogue every chance available, and not really giving a crap how terrible the actors are acting (the actor who plays Leon, for instance, just talks louder when he is supposed to be angry)—also, Sienna Guillory—who plays Jill—was by far the weakest in the film even though she did fairly well as Jill Valentine in Apocalypse.And now we're getting to a point in the Resident Evil film franchise in which the rubber nipples are exposed—the fan boys only watch the films to laugh; the unbiased viewers might come out thinking it was entertaining, but over the top, and none of the monsters made any sense (and they wouldn't be alone—the B.O.W.'s didn't make any sense to me either); the actors are lazy; the plot is confusing when it's vague and absurd when it's clear; and worse of all, the director doesn't care about the source material anymore.I think that Hollywood might pull out the Nolan card pretty soon, because Resident Evil does have very important contemporary themes. Biological warfare seems more realistic than nuclear in this day and age, but Paul and friends seem to be stuck on the zombies and the theatrics of the game franchise, rather than the scientific aspects, the concepts, the survival horror, and the atmospheric tension. What makes the Resident Evil video game franchise so endearing are the story and the characters (which is why Resident Evil 5 was the worst—the lack of survival horror put aside—because that's when the game franchise stopped caring about story and characters; but I blame the directors and producer of RE5 rather than CAPCOM as a whole), but Paul W.S. Anderson focuses on plot (which isn't the same as story) and dresses up actors like characters from the game franchise and names them that character from the game franchise and prays that the fans don't realize they're nothing like the character from the franchise. I give credit to the Harry Potter film series for at least attempting to stay true to the story of the books; while still they're nowhere near as good as the books because filmmakers tend to care more about plot than they do story—which is a wide spreading disease in the illiterate world of Hollywood—it's still an honorable attempt, unlike with the Resident Evil franchise. Seriously, the Resident Evil from games 1-4 has a good story, so why did Paul W.S. Anderson butcher it?",Resident Evil - Retribution
287,chad-259,"Poor Acting, Rips Off 'Aliens', and Time for a Series Reboot With A New Director",5,26 September 2012,"The first 4 films were actually an enjoyable ride given their limited budget. They all featured great production design, good scores, and Milla alone is a perfect reason to watch them. However, this latest instalment felt cheaply made, put together in a hurry, and stole it's plot from one of the premier action films. Where to start?The Bad: Acting (other than Milla, the little girl, and 1 or 2 others), too much like a video game you couldn't play, The 3D didn't add much.The Good: Production design, a cool intro, energetic Tokyo fight sequence, good use of spatial mapping as in the first film, Russian zombies (with an homage to 'Shock Waves' perhaps) and a fun score by Tomandandy.Alice is a fun character, and echoes Milla's other strong female role models including Leeloo, Violet, and to some extent, Joan of Arc. It's one of the major reasons why she's appreciated by both men and women alike. Here she pulls off the mom role well, but it was just Ripley's role played by her. The writers could have given her more to work with than just stealing Aliens note-for-note. The parent/child storyline is nothing new in films, and Cameron definitely wasn't the first to use it effectively, but it's certainly stronger than the one used in 'Retribution'.Everything purposely felt cheesy this time around. It'll prob do well overseas but it's time for Paul to hand over the series to a new director and writers.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Well i watched every Resident Evil movie so far, so if u watched them to, go for this one, u will find it amusing, did not say u will like it, well u will but in a funny way, it wont be boring. For all others there are a few perimeters which help u decide. Do u like beautiful woman in tight costumes kicking zombie asses? U don't really care much for story/acting/dialog in a action movie, u just want to see nice illogical action packed scenes?? If the answer is yes to these 2 questions then watch this movie, if not, plz don't do your brain harm by watching this movie. Do u have to watch other RE movies in order to understand this movie? Well lets say its even better not to watch any of the RE movies before this one, u will understand more. So why 6/10? Its simple, from 1h30min its 1h15min of action, good action scenes although illogical (watch it and u will know what im talking about) and i didn get bored, woalaa!! P.s.

289,effe97,Disappointing,1,6 December 2012,"Now this chapter really looks like a video game, too bad it's not the original one! You know, video games don't need a coherent plot, a logic proceedings and, above all, an explanation of what happens. I guess the author thinks this movie doesn't need that as well. Surprisingly enough he is the producer of the previous chapters (far better than this one). It's just a mix between old stuff from the first movie, tons of special effects and some ideas stolen from an old successful movie (Escape from New York). The end leaves the door open for yet another, likely worse, sequel! Save your money and time!",Resident Evil - Retribution

I was so pumped to see this one, but maybe after the first thirty minutes I was completely bummed. I even turned over to my roommate and said, ""This movie is terrible. It's so bad it's good. Honestly, my main complaint about this installment is the lack of dialogue. There weren't very many complete sentences, maybe six of them throughout the whole movie? Most from Wesker. That's me exaggerating -- the film is complete madness, the visuals are great and as others have review ""complete eye candy."" Any fan of the film is of course already on board, but I can only hope that they felt the same way. This movie was terrible-- as a fan I loved it. You'll make up your mind either way. Don't look for much plot development, character development-- no one is growing, neither is the story. The film leads with a great step into a sixth installment, I can only hope Anderson will grow some respect for the fans and have our characters actually SAY SOMETHING this time. I don't write many reviews, so I apologize if there is anything wrong with it-- if it's not the greatest.

I just could not connect with any of the characters and in the end frankly did not care if they live or die.

292,blueyedragon019,Easily the WORST of the series!,2,22 December 2012,"I'v been a really big fan of this franchise since day one, And this movie was just a complete and utter disappointment for me. There loads of faults that i had found with the last one, but at least i walked out of the theater happy after seeing ""Afterlife""....But with Retribution i was like WTF did i just see??!!! It was so bad.....I had really high expectations because of seeing all these cool characters from the previous movies return, Like Jill Valentine, Rain, Carlos....And you would think that Alice will be extremely anguised and hurt seeing the people she cared about turned against her by Umbrella...But, NOPE! It looks like she didn't care at all....She didn't even resist trying to kill Jill when she knows that Jill is under the Red Queen's control! And speaking of the Red Queen, I was pretty excited that she was back, but replacing her with a snotty little girl actress that is as threatening as a mouse?! What a freakin joke! This movie was a HUGE waste of potential! It played out like a video game, with hardly any dialogue....If there was any, It was all mostly just one-liners, like Alice saying ""waiting for a written invitation?"" WTF! And no character development or interactions between these characters whatsoever. Jill, Carlos, & Rain were really revelant to Alice and NOTTING?? Not one shred of emotion, shock or resistance towards them??!! The acting was BAD. & I never had a problem with the acting from the previous films. Jill Valentine was the biggest waste of the movie for me, After YEARS of waiting for her return and fighting for her return, We get absolute CRAP! The fans should write the next movie, When are these stupid studios/directors realize that our imput holds extreme importance because these movies are being made for us! Yet it seems that they made this movie for Apes. Which i'm sure they wouldn't like it either! And Paul needs to make his wife step aside sometimes ans let another actor have a chance to shine and kick ass! The reason why i didn't give this movie one star, because i really liked the suburbia outbreak scene, And the character Becky, was the only good actress in the movie! I also liked ""good"" Rain but just ANOTHER huge waste......The white corridor scene was cool too....I thought the hugely anticipated Jill VS. Alice scene was alright....It was mostly dance fighting, which was a huge letdown...It should have been way more brutal and bloody. & it irked me off because you can tell when the Jill Valentine stunt double is fighting because of the CHEAP wig, That looks like it has been purchased from ""Shaynayay's wigshop""...lol",Resident Evil - Retribution

294,RaGeNyC,A New Perspective,8,23 December 2012,"When I saw Retribution in the theaters earlier this year, I wasn't too impressed. The plot was wacky and it wasn't scary. Actually, the Resident Evil movies have been getting less scary since the first one, which I thought was scary and had a very creepy feel to it. I guess the wacky plot didn't really bother me too much though, since it is a zombie movie, so my belief is suspended pretty high anyway. But the movie just wasn't scary, and for a zombie flick, there should be some decent scares.When I saw that it was released on Blu-ray the other day, I started thinking about the movie all over again. But this time, I took it all in from an action-flick perspective. I realized I had to own this movie. Retribution is balls to the wall action and eye candy. It doesn't get much better than this. It's funny that that's all it took to totally change my mind about this film, but it did. Retribution has everything you'd look for in an action film, plus zombies. I'm not saying it's film of the year, but it's a very satisfying action movie experience. Something you'll watch for the action and graphics, not for the scares. If you take the movie this way, you'll enjoy all it has to offer. 8 out of 10 stars.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I also regret that I called my neighbor, too. It was such a big mistake! From now on, reading a few reviews will have priority against reservation etc. The first 15-20 minutes are quality scenes, very good sound and video effects, very good music. Everything begins in a perfect style. And then all drops into crap. Originality vanishes like mist and you wake up in the middle of clichés and copied ideas. The Matrix, Underworld, Alien/Prometheus and maybe some other movies have been used as ""source of inspiration'. Actors act horribly. They seem uninterested, bored. Some scenes reminded me of cheap porn movie intros. After some time all seemed to be scenes made for shooter games. There are some sort of simulated levels which Alice has to go through. It stinks so much of gaming. To name just a few examples, so some won't say I'm talking crap. 1. If Kate from Underworld had a girl, then Alice must have one, too. 2. Wesker is like Mr Smith or what his name was in Matrix. In the last scene he even moves so fast. 3. Alice's girl is captured by the huge monster that will put her in a sort of slimy cocoon - Alien/Prometheus. With all that money spent on fuel and cinema, I could have had a nice weekend in the woods. I have been waiting for Retribution since the beginning of year.

There's the Wesker twist, Rain gone bad, Jill gone good (back to normal), multicultural zombies, umbrella showing us it's teeth again, better effects, nice car chase, Milla never looked better, and to be honest i'm satisfied with the acting and the cast enough to enjoy this film.I find that it successfully mixes in one big bowl bits of other films, including ambiance, effects, recurring cast and we're all back to experiments yet again. THE ENDING is bad-ass and somehow fits the current flow of the franchise.It's NOT racist, or boring, or disappointing, you can never have enough latex, women fighting, gun fights and cheesy dialogues. But YOU can however have a little bit of all those things into one nice film. I FOR ONE ENJOYED IT QUITE A BIT, and just an advice: ALWAYS IGNORE reviews good or bad. Go with your guts.

299,danpaul1,My Review - A Good One,9,17 September 2012,"I did go see this movie with expectations of it being as good as Afterlife. While I would give Afterlife a 10+, I only gave this a nine. Sure there are some plot holes which could have been filled in. However, The RE series is about effects, action, sci-fi technology, the end of the world, massive explosions, Milla Jovovich as Alice kicking butt. One thing the movie was - unpredictable. I think Capcom have hit the nail on the head with Andersen, he is a great director with a great, intensely vibrant vision. The finale was epic, both story wise and visually, and yes - a fantastic cliffhanger. It is my 2nd favourite movie of the year, first being The Dark Knight Rises. I do think some parts of the end of Afterlife could have been touched on more, been better explained, but at the end of the day, there were more mutants, the zombies were the most creative I have seen yet. This movie is getting mixed reviews but I hope it makes a killing at the box office - I still want a sixth film! GO SEE IT WITH AN OPEN MIND!",Resident Evil - Retribution
300,J-pbuckeridge,If you liked the previous RE .. Avoid this!,1,13 July 2014,"First ever review on IMDb, had to sign up and complain about this film. A lot of people don't really like the previous resident evil installments but there's a few of us that do! I'm one of them! Here's a quick breakdown why.RE1: Start of its own story, underground zombie outbreak with hybrid ""boss"" like monsters with a team of specialized soldiers fighting it all. Awesome right? RE2: Carries on from the first, the Hive is opened and has now infected the surrounding Racoon city. More soldiers, more survivors with their own mini back stories, more action with bigger guns and more ""Boss"" like elements and Alice discovering her powers more. Awesome.RE3: Virus has spread from racoon city and now pretty much has overtaken the world. Small band of survivors trying to get by and finding and helping anyone else along the way with characters from previous installments. Even bigger, more badass, more guns, more Alice powers and more enemies along the way. Awesome.RE4: Ending of RE3 was a promise of a virus free zone, whatever characters that were left have gone their. Alice follows and finds, well even more zombies bigger and more badass. Follows the RE5 game in some ways with new enemies and the game characters. Film ends with us wanting to know whats going to happen next. Oh and its in a huge prison they thinks safe... Awesome right? Now we come to Retribution. Carries on from none of the above, is a massive random mix match of thoughts and stupid over the top ideas we've all seen countless times before. There's no story, there's no plot. Halfway through i started to play on my phone. I couldn't care less what happened or who lived or died. Forgot how it ends and i hope the upcoming Final Chapter will continue from RE4 and finish once and for all what we all wanted to know would happen in this one. I honestly don't even know what i just watched. Just forget it and leave it alone.",Resident Evil - Retribution

The trend continues as it's more of a action film than a horror film since the first one. And no real surprises which is disappointing ,also Afterlife is a better film than this one . You get some familiar faces also returning which is good, but things do seem rushed as the running time is around 90mins. plus the writing is lacking a bit, mashed up with lots of chaos to hide the weak points of the film & a borrowed element from another sci-fi film in the mix .

302,inkcrayon,"rushed, soundtrack did not fit, but it was fun",8,14 September 2012,"I own the the previous four movies on video and will be adding this one around New Year's.You know what to expect if you are still hanging around as a fan after four blood-soaked, enjoyable movies. This fifth installment into the Resident Evil series reminded me a lot of the fourth Underworld movie in the way that it is constructed.Some of the acting here is wooden, but the performances during the action scenes make up for it. I was not satisfied at the end, was wanting more and did not want to wait another two years if we are fortunate to experience a sixth.Even though it felt rushed, the soundtrack is slow in order to give the movie a feeling of epicness. If you peeked at the cast list then it is understandable. An action movie that is slow does annoy me some but not enough to lessen the fun of the action scenes.We leave behind the horror genre tag and become a sci-fi/action movie so the scares may be gone, but the excitement does not go away with it.Knowledge of the first and fourth movie seem to be the most important here so you may want to revisit those before watching the fifth.",Resident Evil - Retribution
303,Ravalessa,A lot of action!,6,15 September 2012,"Where do I begin? I just came back from the movie but, surprisingly, I did not feel disappointed like I did when I came back from seeing Snow White and the Huntsman. This time, I knew what to expect: Alice kicking ass while everyone else dies, basically. Instead of disappointment, I was a little surprised by how it wasn't THAT bad (like Afterlife), but there were a lot of flaws. **Text ahead contains spoilers** I'm no critic, but none of the acting made me cringe like SWATH *cough*. I thought every character, even the actress who played Ada (will get to her later) and the little girl were good. The 3D was awesome, of course, and I think they sped up the slowdowns. There was still slowmo, though. Not as much as Afterlife, thank god. Now, characters. Alice showed a lot of vulnerability in this movie, and that's a good thing. We all know she's badass, but this time we were shown that she's not invincible. There were a lot of questions, like why didn't she question that Wesker was alive? Where's Chris and Claire? Besides Good Rain/Bad Rain, I actually liked Ada. I looooved the scene from RE4 when she goes up again Alice but is cut short by a knife to the neck. Of course, we all know Leon should've been doing that. I think the actress sounded a lot like Ada Wong herself, too. My only problem is that she did not get enough screen time. Jill was awesome in the movie, but again lacked screen time. It's true, she does sound kind of strange in the beginning. I think the scene where Alice gets off the scarab and she regains her senses should've been more dramatic. Leon was...okay. He didn't feel like Leon, besides his black shirt and the hair. My favorite part was when he placed a hand on Ada's thigh, though, and Ada was disgusted, haha. I liked Barry. He was badass, but, like everyone but Alice, lacked screen time. I loved the part with his magnum. Oh, and no, there was no ""Jill Sandwich."" :( G Rain/B Rain were probably my favorite. Great acting from her, and I think she had the most personality than everyone else.]I liked Luther in this better than Afterlife. There was just...a little more to him, in my opinion. My main problem with these movies is the lack of development. When the characters die, you feel nothing. You just shrug it off. My second problem in this movie was the action. As a huge action fan, I felt like it was just too much. Things just popped up randomly, leaving absolutely no room for character development or story. Also, there wasn't that intense, adrenaline feeling when characters are killing. I felt that in Afterlife, but none in this because I felt like there was no suspense/thrill during the acton scenes in this. Although the pacing wasn't cringe-worthy, there were still a lot of shots where they should've just continued instead of resuming back to Alice. The script was horrible, in my opinion, and cliché. ""I'm gonna kill you,"" or ""Good luck,"" etc. Needs more creative comebacks/threats. Also, what the hell was up with the ""Las Plagas Undead?"" They looked like Nazis. And no Licker would be that big. ._. The Becky/Alice scenes were okay and a little touching. Probably the only attempt to provide development and emotion in the movie. Becky's remark to Rain on Bad Rain was pretty hilarious; it got the whole theatre chuckling. So, this concludes my review. Sorry if I put too much. Overall, I think it was average. Not horrible, but not great. Better than the previous two, but not better than the first two. If you're just looking for an action-packed movie with no story or character development, and lots of random deaths, this is for you. There were a few jump scenes, as well. The best part where I didn't feel as lethargic during the rest of the movie was the last, epic scene with the Alice vs. Jill fight. Also, Bad Rain just pummeled everyone, lol!",Resident Evil - Retribution

I guess critics are really hard to please. But myself, I really enjoyed this film i don't know why. The acting is pretty good to. I regret not watching this in the cinema. I will definitely watch the succeeding movies in the cinema. I don't get it why people hate this movie so much. I'm pretty sure I will watch the next film after this. I'll keep supporting the Resident Evil series for sure. Bingbing Li, Marry me!",Resident Evil - Retribution
306,andrealoian,Mind Blowing,10,15 September 2012,Resident evil retribution is the best one of all of the other movies the special effects where amazing Milla and the whole cast did a great job. It does not look the way you think when you first start to watch the move but then it starts up and then it never slows down. This movie keeps you in your seat the whole time. When the movie ended I was very sad that it was over I did not want it to end. You should never listen to the gamers or critics they don't know anything the gamers always complain that the movie is not like the games or things like that don't listen to them this is a must see movie! Milla never disappoints she is great go see this movie!!,Resident Evil - Retribution
307,legioner8800,"This is a pure action 1hr SCI-fi movie, not a drama!",9,7 December 2012,"I am surprised, and kind-a disturbed by the ignorance of many of the viewers here. You should familiarize with what you are paying for before you spend money on movie tickets, return at home and criticize without understanding the concept.Let me get some things clear: * This is an action SCI-FI(=NOT REAL) movie - don't expect realism! This movie could only be compared to the 90's action movies with lots of cool effects. The first movie already set the tone that this is unrealistic story (do you believe that zombies actually exist?). If you want realism, become a volunteer in Iraq or Afghanistan.* This is a part of s sequence - threat this as another part of the series. Why would you otherwise expect 1hr of references to the old movies, if it is supposed that you already watched them? This is not Star Wars! This part was a pure 1hr action instead of 1hr talks and clichés and like <1 min action. Find out what <<< holism >>> is and apply it to this movie franchise. Maybe then you will understand it.* Why would you still compare it to the games? If you played the games and expect a movie on the games, basically you will be watching a game play-through. (Then I will be laughing on comments like ""well spent money"")The only criticism that I have about the series is that Paul drifted away from the zombies being the main issue to being no obstacle at all and focusing on bigger issues like Wesker and stronger mutants. But I understand his decision. If he dramatizes the zombies every new episode the script would be trivial like those TV zombie series. After all , the main character matures and learns how to kill zombies better. This is a pure action SCI-fi movie, not a drama! Are you still confused? Then, probably the RE movie franchise isn't for you.",Resident Evil - Retribution
308,wiselimz,"Critics, stop jumping on the bandwagon and give untrue negative critiques.",8,14 September 2012,"Hello everyone, I'm a 17 year-old teen who just went out to watch Resident Evil: Retribution with his friends tonight.I have been a fan since 2002, with my Mom and we just love Milla Jovovich (Alice) so freaking much - she has so much chemistry with the whole RE (Resident Evil) series itself.First of all, I would have to apologize for my English since it's my 2nd language, not my native language. This is my first time reviewing a movie on IMDb and the reason I am doing this is because I am so infuriated by so many negative reviews, especially the one which is being featured at the IMDb page, saying oh how this movie sucks and how Anderson ran into writing blocks, yadda, yadda, yadda.You know, since the first movie, people have been giving negative critiques, saying it is generic, saying there is no originality, saying there is no storyline, saying there are plot holes. What has become out of this is a whole let's-give-RE-bad-reviews-all-the-time bandwagon. I mean, it is just so easy finding out flaws out of a movie if you put your mind in it. This movie is awesome for the following reasons: 1) Milla Jovovich - She is so full of energy. Her fighting scenes are so surreal and the way she talks, the way she moves, the whole set just redefines Alice as the whole zombie-killing badass. Her acting is so commendable on this installment. There was one scene - which I won't spoil - where she had to decide quickly and certain circumstances indicated that she might be in grave danger and just that moment she shred a tear of fear; this scene was so powerful I still remember it now.2) Opening credits - Seriously, negative reviewers? It is one of the most creative ones I have seen for a horror movie. It was so cool seeing bullets of guns flying back to their origins and everything was just spectacular. The cinematography was spot-on for the opening credits. For the first in my life, I didn't mind the long opening credits. 3) Action-packed - Who wants a zombie movie without action? This whole movie was so freaking action packed, I found myself not breathing during so many scenes. This movie, I assure you, would hold you on to your seats and make you not wanting to blink, because each scene is just so brightly put together.4) Creativity - Seriously? Generic? I have never seen such beautifully crafted zombies in any zombie movies I've seen. This movie just gave a variety of the undead I was so awed whenever the undead attacked Alice or her friends.I would not drone on and on because I realize I am not the kind of person who gets his points across easily. I do know we are all entitled to our opinions but I just can't stand it when the negative reviews are all so unnecessarily negative. Give some credit to this RE's installment's team! They did a great job! Li Bing Bing (Ada) also did great - she had significant chemistry with Alice and I loved it.Yes, there were plot holes but there were quite minor, and the mind-blowing scenes just overwhelmed these ""plot holes"".If you didn't like the movie, you're most probably just another critic who is on the bandwagon or a person who hates zombie movies.I love zombie movies. I love Milla Jovovich. I love Resident Evil. Keep 'em coming.8/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
309,bruno_posse,They Did It Again.,2,1 August 2013,"As a huge fan of Resident Evil games, this movie (and all the others) are a big disappointment. First of all, there's Alice. I Mean, who the hell is she? Some kind of a freak with zombie super-powers who should never be in any of the movies. IT'S A RESIDENT EVIL MOVIE, THE FANS WANTS TO SEE OUR BELOVED CLAIRE, JILL, CHRIS, LEON, ETC AS THE PROTAGONISTS, NOT HER!OK, all of those were present in the last movies, but they were nothing but supporting characters for Alice. Ada for example couldn't be worse: in the video game series she is a mysterious woman, full of herself, with legendary abilities, in the movie, she's no more than a Chinese little girl who barely got out of her 18's. Leon is just a selfish coward who wanted to let everybody die to save himself, Barry is a weirdo, and there's Jill.. the worst character of them all, who became a umbrella hybrid or anything like that. And I'm still trying to forget that shameful presentation of Claire in the third movie. Of course they're all there to watch Alice save the day and could be easily replaced with any nobody in the plot. Maybe that's what's went too wrong with those movies: they insists with Alice, when all of the fans wants her far away as possible and our beloved video game heroes taking the action as they did in the games. 3 stars because the fighting scenes were definitely nice, and I wouldn't mind paying attention to the story, because it's simply one of the worst that I've seen in a long time. It's actually great that this movie revenues didn't payed the costs, maybe they'll have to listen to fans and finally make a decent, loyal to the game sequence, or to finish this horrible series, let the zombies (are they still zombies anyway?) take over the world.",Resident Evil - Retribution
310,luigiloverguy,Satisfying at the very least.,8,16 September 2012,"I'm not sure about the number of people who have stuck with these movies over the years, but i'm betting that many of them are fans of the video games from whence they are based. That being said, any comparison between the movies, and the video games should be taken lightly.The movie starts with the familiar Resident Evil Movie formula. This is starting from the cliff hanger from the last movie, and retconning it until it becomes something completely unlike what is shown at the end of the previous movie. What I mean is, you will lose the current story's plot and even some key characters between titles, or within the first 10 minutes of the subsequent film.This can be noted primarily in the third movie with the absence of Jill Valentine. She makes an appearance at the end of the second installment, Resident Evil Apocalypse, when Jill and friends break Alice out of her Umbrella holding cell. Her fate is undetermined until the end of the fourth movie where she appears to serve as a cliff hanger.In case you get utterly confused between titles, Alice, the franchises' main protagonist, is willing to recap the entire series thus far, and throws in some extra information. (Such as Jill Valentine being captured by Umbrella.)This is also a familiar element of the Resident Evil Movies.Our opening scene is a backwards, slow motion battle of what is about to ensue after we speak with Alice. This is also known as the conclusion to our cliff hanger from the previous movie. This is all it is. It serves little purpose to the rest of the film, except Alice is once again captured by Umbrella and is put in a holding cell. And there you have your dynamic of the fifth movie. Alice must escape from Umbrella's grasp once again.Unfortunately, this is the plot of Retribution. Alice escaping, but with the help of some familiar heroes from the video game series. Moreover, we have lost the Redfield Siblings, who play important roles with each of the new characters that appear in Retribution. I'd like to also add that their fates are unknown. Shocker.Jill Valentine and Leon S. Kennedy are the most notable characters that appear in the film from the video game series. Jill is in her Resident Evil 5 get up, while Leon is in his Resident Evil 4's. Barry Burton is also in this film, but i'd rather not get into that. He is along side Leon, which makes no sense in the context of the games, and is killed in the movie. Bummer. Leon and Barry DID appear in a non cannon game together, but again it did not happen in accordance to the Resident Evil video game time line.What i'd like to say about the absence of the Redfield siblings is that their characters were crucial to those of Jill and Leon's and even to Barry. Leon and Claire Redfield have a history in Resident Evil 2, While Jill and Chris are long time partners throughout the series. Chris is ultimately the one who saves Jill in Resident Evil 5, thus it is a shame that they were unable to appear in the same film together. If anything, Barry should have reprised Chris's role in the film, as he also has a history with Jill Valentine. But similarly, he makes no interaction with Jill and is killed.The plot throws in a little deaf girl who believes she is Alice's daughter. This whole simulation and cloning thing has confused me throughout the series and still does in this movie. The little girl does offer some emotional and heart wrenching parts, but is ultimately pointless to the progression of the film. What happened to the last little girl they had as a minor character? She disappeared and was never heard of again after Apocalypse.The movie ends with an awesome fight scene and a pointless one. Rain, from the first movie, reappears (as two different characters) and occupies the men, while Alice fights Jill. Another familiar formula: a major character from the previous film, absent in the video games, is killed in the sequel. This is Luther, although his death had a minor, if non existent, effect on me.Alice, with little effort, manages to pull the brainwashing device from Jill's chest, and saves the day. They are all rescued by a helicopter, where Alice is met face to face with Wesker, the main antagonist from the video game series and from the fourth movie. It is unclear as to why he's alive, and i'm still not sure how he's turned 'good' in this movie, but it ends with Him, Leon, Jill, Wesker, and Ada all side by side, ready to face the sequel.But one question remains, no a few, but how will the ending of Retribution be retconned and summed up in the first ten minutes of the sixth film? Which characters will disappear with no explanation? Which of the video game characters will make a a debut? My theory is that each video game character has a two movie limit. Jill, unfortunately, will be out, and Leaon and Ada will stay.Overall, the movie was decent and entertaining. It didn't do much plot wise, but was still good. I like some details from the games that the writers paid attention to, like Jill's VZ61s from RE5, and Barry's famous magnum (but without his silly catchphrases.) I know i said comparisons to the games should be take lightly, but i guess that's all i've done in this review. So go see this movie, and if you've missed one, you can buy all four in a blu ray bundle.8/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
311,jetmox-458-423688,Great... Was better than I thought by along way,9,16 September 2012,The first RE will always be the best. This one IMHO is the second best as in the first it is one action sequence after another held together by a really thin plot. If you are am RE fan you know what you are getting. I love that they bought back some of the best characters from the previous ones (michelle Rodriguez) and of course introduced Ada Wong who looks absolutely stunning in all her scenes. Leon from the RE games also introduced ( looked like an Avenger.....) Good will hunting this is not but if you want 1.5 hrs of zombie action this is your fix and should rated as such. Onward to the final installation hopefully next year...,Resident Evil - Retribution
312,sirdanielg-467-997285,Awesome movie but.....,7,2 January 2013,"Let's face it, RE: Retribution is awesome... in my opinion probably the best one yet! There are some scenes where the CGI fails to amuse the audience because it is fake-looking. Also, some things just don't make sense. FOR EXAMPLE:At the near end of the film where Alice and Jill are fighting, Jill grabs Alice by the throat and attempts to push her head into the conveyor wheel (a tank-like wheel) of a vehicle. The wheel is not yet moving. It suddenly turns on by itself, and Jill continues the attempt to kill Alice.In conclusion, RE: Retribution (in my opinion) is the best RE yet. However, times of fake looking CGI hold me back from giving it a higher score.=====8/10=====",Resident Evil - Retribution
313,jsoetandi,The extreme worst of all Resident Evil series,1,13 September 2012,"I love Resident Evil series. Despite the mediocre reviews it gets in the past, I still go to the cinema on its release and always looking forward for the next sequel. But RE5 fails beyond believe. The storyline is utterly crap. The action are cheesy, the actors are cheesy, the whole movie is a joke to the RE series. I am completely disappointed at how the whole movie turns out to be.*spoiler alert* The whole movie is set on one giant Umbrella underwater laboratory and Alice and friends is trying to break out of it. Along the way they encounter some zombies and finally got out. And that's literally about the summary of the whole story!They try to use music to intensify everything.. but it becomes very cheesy. Especially towards the end before the final fight when Jill walks out of the submarine.The Red Queen is total crap. Cheesy, stupid.. The fighting scene itself is very cheesy and unrealistic. They hardly get hit by a bullet even when they were standing in open view. But it seems like their bullet always managed to hit the enemy. Even the one bullet that hit Alice, didn't even do her much harm. What a load of crap.At the final fight, it was obvious some of them had had their bones cracked. But they were still standing and fighting as if their bone is not really a necessary part of their body. They look pretty healthy for someone with broken bone!When Alice beats Jill.. it was so obvious from the beginning that that's what needs to be done. But the scriptwriter must've made Alice so dumb that she did not realize that from the beginning. Sadly, the viewers are not as dumb as the scriptwriter.And on the final scene when Leon touches Ada's thigh.. THATS AS CHEESIEST AS IT COULD GET! I could almost cry looking at that scene. What the f... *sigh*I apologize for using a lot of ""cheesy"" word in my review. But it is exactly how I feel when I see it. It's like a bunch of amateurs movie makers trying to make action movie.All in all, I wouldn't even rate it 5 for effort. Its a total lazy movie writing. I still want to see RE6, but I seriously hope they do not FAIL as big as this one. What a load of crap this movie is.",Resident Evil - Retribution
314,freaktation,WTF Happened? Watch and judge for yourself - But don't waste too much on it,1,15 September 2012,"I was doing a small Resident Evil movie marathon in preparation for seeing this movie, and I was really looking forward to see how they could save the ending of the fourth one - But I was quite hopeful that I would at least get a good action story with an acceptable plot. That have been true for all the others in the series so why not this one.Well was I in for a rude awakening. Honestly if you enjoyed all the former movies and you consider them ""part of their own story"" meaning that your pretty much ignoring the video games when watching the movies then you'll find yourself even more amazed by how terrible this movie is.I will avoid going into details about plot as others have done that and perfectly expressed the errors in it (I am of course referring to those more negative reviews you'll find as most of the very positive ones doesn't really put a lot of effort into mentioning it.. maybe because even they would have trouble claiming it to be a good movie then ;) ).But I can easily sum-up the main problems with this movie: The plot and the acting. That is not a good thing for a movie and trust me it shows. The plot has some vague references to the former movie, but that's quickly forgotten and all your in for is a mess of action scenes and bad (and I mean bad) CGI effects. Somehow the actors manage to look not in the least interested in the gun battles they take part in, and at the same time do a damn good job to remove any sense of immersion you might have scrapped together, for instance by appearing utterly unfamiliar with handling their weapons.. There is some odd alien references.. or more likely ""inspired"" events that make no sense in the overall story and world.Finally the whole absurd-storm will end with you sitting back confused as to what you just watched, shaking your head in shocked astonishment, trying to comprehend just how bad it was. Then the anger will arise due to the disappointment of what this could have been and here I am writing a review to warn others.I personally will not count this as part of the series, I'll count it as the series failed little-brother rip-off that should never ever have been made.I cannot in any situation recommend this movie.. by far the most disappointing, meaningless and confounded mess I ever saw.",Resident Evil - Retribution
315,tom-sells,"Has certain elements from the Games, to help adapt fans to the Movie....",8,16 September 2012,"There's a lot of hate for this movie, in my opinion i think Paul W.S. Anderson has improved his work for the Resident Evil Movies. I Know a lot of fans complain ""We've Seen All This In The Games, There's No Originality!"" Well to be honest, Yes. Frankly it is true. But the Movies are including Characters and Elements from the Games to help bring more fans to both the gaming franchise and the movie franchise. 'Alice' (Milla Jovovich) Is a whole different side to Resident Evil. I know fans complain about her being able to have certain 'Powers' that were never included in the games. But Guys! ITS JUST A MOVIE! If Capcom hated the Movies they would have forbidden them to be continually made! Resident Evil Extinction should never had been made in my opinion, its the only one i found completely screwy to both the games and the two previous movies. Overall, the twists and turns through out this movie made me want to see the next one, and want to know what Umbrella is planning to throw at Alice.SPOILER! Don't Read If You Have Not Seen The Movie!!The only issue that i have and the majority of every other fan is that the main evil Characters such as 'Wesker' have turned sides, True Resident Evil fans know that Wesker is not a Good Guy at all, the stuff he pulls in the games should have rubbed off onto the directer and should not have been turned out the way it did in the movie. Characters from the other Movies, Such as 'Rain', 'Jill', 'One' and 'Carlos' were all pitting against Alice, there were so many moments where I was thinking ""ALICE! JUST TELL THEM WHO THEY REALLY ARE!"" At least that way they would have held back at certain points in the movie and at least would have realized in the end they were being used by Umbrella. Instead resulting in Killing 'Barry', 'Luther West' and some of them losing there own lives. (For some reason, I think Rain is still alive...ish) I mean, Wesker survives a helicopter Explosion in the previous movie, so who's to say Rain survives? The ending gave me chills and to expect a lot more in the next movie, which supposedly comes out next year.Thanks for Reading my Review, overall i give this movie 8/10",Resident Evil - Retribution

We're 5 movies in now and it hasn't gone anywhere and it's not going anywhere. It's not even enough eye candy for fans of the games. I blame myself for being a glutton for punishment I guess; I've seen all the Resident Evil movies so far so I guess I'm in for the long haul. An overlong-haul. The fact that I'm a huge fan of the games unfortunately doesn't help when passing judgment on the movies. Retribution is, in my opinion, the worst one to date. The story is just, for lack of a more sophisticated word, DUMB. *Spoilers to follow*An underground facility that uses clones to recreate outbreaks? Sounds like a huge waste of time and resources to me. And the reasoning behind having said facility? To show China what the outbreak would look like in the United States. To show Japan what the outbreak would look like in Russia. Really? You mean you couldn't just put a zombie in a room with 4 people and show them what happens? Or at least a computer simulation? Much more cost effective. Having a big dumb facility just makes for having a lot of big dumb plot holes and questions. With all of those clones running around down there, you mean to tell me you can't just repopulate the human race? How do you keep having enough clothes to clothe them all? Who cleans up the bloody messes after each simulation? Why does Wesker have a change of heart all of a sudden for the human race and wants Alice to help save it? Wasn't he hell-bent on trying to kill everyone in the last movie Resident Evil: I'm Lost? Why does Umbrella have a supply of leather costumes for Alice? Why doesn't anyone have to reload ever? Leon's not using the Chicago Typewriter and I don't see anyone shooting any BSAA emblems, so according to all reasoning ever, guns need to be reloaded occasionally. Why didn't Alice just F'n recognize the ridiculously OBVIOUS glowing ""bad-guy"" looking scarab on Jill's chest? HEY! That must be her source of evil! WHERE IS CHRIS AND CLAIRE REDFIELD? Whose bright idea was it to have a deaf clone?! THE LIST GOES ON AND ON!!!!!! Call this movie Resident Evil: Plot Holes. Although we love seeing our favorite characters and subtle nods towards the games, we don't appreciate them being utterly stupid. Please do it right otherwise you're doing us a disservice. Throwing in new characters doesn't do them justice. I'm really glad you included Leon so he could have such a stimulating conversation with Alice. ""I'm not letting you pass,"" ""Let me pass,"" ""Ok."" And THAT WAS BARRY?! Seriously? Oh good, you gave him a Colt Python, so he's automatically Barry. Ada was at least legit; everything about her was right, if nothing else in the movie. Here they mentioned Las Plagas. According to this movie, Las Plagas are steroids you can inject into your Michelle Rodriguez to make her do X-Ray punches to people's hearts a-la the new Mortal Kombat. I'd much rather see her turn into a ""head sprouter"" than seeing her juiced up on 'roids. We've seen Girl Fight already. You know what, I'd rather just not see her at all, because she is in no way important. Oh, and hi Luther, I'm glad you survived the last movie and mysteriously teamed up with Leon. It's so important that you survived because you're such an integral part in this one...oh no now you're dead. Great job. Everything about this movie is just stupid. I didn't see it in 3D thank God, but I'm sure that sucked too. It's time to just scrap the franchise. Matter of fact, it was time to scrap it 3 movies ago. Just make a REAL Resident Evil movie for the love of everything holy. Going in, you know the movie is bad, so I got what I deserved, but my God, I didn't think the franchise could actually get any worse. The bright side?

319,b-nax,3D has rarely ever been that impressive!,9,1 October 2012,"Where does this new hype of vanity on the story's and character's profoundity of action movies come from? That's so ridiculous! I am actually not a fan of zombie movies (I've seen around 4 apart from the Resident Evil series), but this movie can not be counted as a regular zombie movie. The intention of this movie isn't telling a story or creating interesting characters that one can empathize with. But to me this is a totally wrong trend of Hollywood, since movies shall show us what we DON'T experience in our everyday life anyway. A movie is a piece of art, and not the biography and analysis of a character (although this can also be very entertaining if it's innovative).This movie is a superb composition of compelling sounds and 3-dimensional pictures of an amazing quality. Resident Evil 5 constantly generates an atmosphere that I have hardly ever felt before.Those low ratings here are nothing but what happens, if the regular action-slasher movie audience, who doesn't understand anything from arts, prides itself on being oh so intellectual and vain. So far too vain to enjoy something, that provides the best of its kind. There were many engraving scenes or even just pictures that have the potential of becoming standards.People who now talk about how abstract or illogical this movie is are bonkers, action and horror movies mostly have a similar background logic to cartoons or operas, which means - non! But if Maggie Simpson shoots the mafia or if Don Giovanni suddenly begins to sing while in a dialog nobody complains! Because this is what it is all about, because nobody expects science there, nobody expects reality, still everybody is wonderfully entertained! Why do you suddenly expect it here? I hate this reality show trend, shall even our movies now lose all their creativity and fantasy? Movies are for gaining a distance from our boring lives by diving into a world where nothing is impossible. Movies shall not just become mirrors of our society...This movie gripped me and only released me, when it ended. There were only very few seconds where the thrill wasn't perfect. As the title says, the 3D is ideal for this movie, I would even say this movie benefits from it more than Avatar. The parts of the Resident Evil series that I have seen before were boring and gray in comparison to this one. The creatures which appear are not really disgusting or shocking, you don't have to be afraid of bad dreams after watching Resident Evil 5. A few scenes could be a little too thrilling for some people though.",Resident Evil - Retribution
320,ajejebrazov1000,One hour and an half without emotions,2,22 November 2012,"I watched the first two movies of the Resident Evil series, then I jump to this, and I'm very disappointed. While the first movie was an innovation, and all scenery was well-made, this chapter looks like a movie that was shot in a empty room and all details are added using computer graphics. This is a loss of realism, I thought I was playing a video game instead of watching a movie. This feeling was amplified by the absence of mimic of the actors, and by the foregrounds, too often used by director.Secondly, the story is poor: without adding any spoiler to this post, I can confirm that no scary scenes are included, no suspense or twists in the story, but only a great amount of spectacular (and unrealistic) shooting scene. Furthermore think that every spectator can easily predict the following scene.Finally, the 3D version seen on theater is ""flat"": there are few scenes with a deep 3D (the opposite of ""Avangers"" for example), so if you want to see the movie in 2D you don't miss anything.In conclusion, this movie losses the horror-thriller characteristics of the first chapter and the massive use of computer graphics divides the spectator from dynamic of the movie.The only thing I can save is the beauty of the actresses.",Resident Evil - Retribution

And still waste of money and time. I am really big fan of Resident Evil. For the fact I'm big fan of many horror movies but this is terrible. To the movie crew: ""Stand up drink some coffee and make better movie I know you can do it"". To all fans who still waiting to see it or want to buy it on DVD/blue ray do not do it. Its totally not worth the money! I really hope new Resident Evil movie is coming soon. No need new zombies to make movie great. Need good story writing and living by the authors and making us believe that we are there and we are running or shooting at walking zombies and make us believe in it for an hour or two.",Resident Evil - Retribution

There's no red line, the storyline is crap and it reminds more or less of a bad video game. Mindless quotes, seen-that-done-that action scenes, bad acting and a completely messed up plot is what you get. Take for instance the start where the previous film left you, on the boat about to being attacked by the umbrella corp. That's pretty much where you are left story wise throughout the film. I watched it because I've seen the others and had a hope of something more about the story behind umbrellaThis is one of those films, where you are better off taking a walk or counting matches.",Resident Evil - Retribution

WELL......The whole ""Resident Evil"" movie franchise is based off a video game! There is not much plot, a tiny bit of character development, but that is not what you watch this movie for. Like many people say, turn off your brain and enjoy the eye candy. The 3D version is also excellent, with the 3D shot very well and not over used. Settings and CGI are all well created. Zombies look quite generic, but the ""Boss"" monster is pretty awesome! Not much else to say but highly recommended for any gamers or people wanting some brainless action eye candy!",Resident Evil - Retribution
326,heycwalker,Worse One of the RE Movie Series,1,1 June 2013,"Me and my wife tried to watch Retribution yesterday and didn't even make it 30 min in before turning it off. My wife use to play the original game, and thought the first couple of movies did the game justice, as did the Silent Hill movie, but as the RE movies have went on, the story line got little worse and worse and further away from the games which it was based. Retribution was incredibly horrible. Even the first 10 minutes of the movie playing the last 5 minutes of last movie in reverse was so stupid, to only have it replay again normal. Made us wonder if they were really that hard up for story line that they used it as filler. I would say if the plan was to continue down the current path with the RE movies, don't, as its just a waste of studios money on production. #Milla Jovovich﻿ you have some very good movies on your resume. Please don't let them insult you with another one like Retribution. Don't mean to offend anyone, just giving honest feedback.",Resident Evil - Retribution
327,jhegi1,Somebody dropped the ball...,5,2 December 2012,"In this film, I think the franchise traded length for depth.I don't know whose fault it is but the entire movie felt like somebody decided to aim the film at pre-teens despite the 'R' rating. Special effects were fine (some were realistic, others were very unrealistic but still pretty); the movie was lengthy enough to include some plot development, but most of the script felt rushed. It wasn't horrible... but it was as if many of the scenes were shot in just 1 take too few (or 5 minutes of post-editing too few). ""That's where you're wrong""... ""This is a mistake""... ""Get out of my way"" could be an very plausible exchange if the two characters just took 3 seconds of pause in between; without any pause it seems forced, amateurish, and actually disgusting to anyone who grew up in the years before the internet caused such a drop in the dramatic quality of movies. The immediacy which seemed to plague the first 3/4 of the movie combined with the fact that combatants fired weapons, without cover and standing with their whole bodies in view of on-coming fire, yet barely got hit... made me think that somebody is not taking this franchise very seriously.I think this could have been done a lot better... but it does as the prior two movies have; it continues the plot in a new direction without wholly disappointing viewers... though it could have been far more pleasant.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Loved the end of the movie where the actual world is in complete ruin, I am ecstatic and really quite anxious to see the next resident evil coming out in 2015! I seriously wish I could play the part of a hot bad ass chick in a movie!!! Lol :0) there's just something incredibly amazing about a woman who can be fierce, all the actors and actresses in this movie played their parts very well. Whatever happened to the little girl though? Maybe will show in the next movie? Is she going to be given powers and be able to fight alongside the resistance and get revenge for her mother? I'm guessing it will be an epic movie considering it's called ""the final chapter""! So I'm sure everything will all tie together and make for a climatic end! Super stoked! But jeez if I can't be in the movie at least name one of the bad asses TARA (after me of course ; ) ) Keep up the great work! Anxiously waiting!",Resident Evil - Retribution
329,cjs948524,Could've been better. Quick review and breakdown.,5,21 December 2012,This Resident Evil movie has incredible action and fight scenes like most of the other Resident Evil movies people like. The visuals are also rather good considering how much they had crammed into this movie. This particular movie lacks a good storyline. These movies have so much potential but since they have a loyal fan base they really don't seem to care what they're feeding us. It's good they introduce some characters that are new to the movies such as Ada Wong and Leon Kennedy. SOME of these characters were cast poorly. Dialogue throughout the movie can be cheesy and painful. It is nice to see the different kinds of zombies and creatures even though it's brief. Also no one really has to reload so someone turned infinite ammo on which can be fun for the game but not the movie. Bottomline is they really messed up on this Resident Evil. I really would like a revamp of the whole Resident Evil live action movie franchise leading with the game's version of the mansion incident with Tyrant.Quick Breakdown 10 being great 1 being poor - Plot - 2 Dialouge - 3 Casting of new characters - 5 Overall Acting - 4 Visuals - 8 Action - 8 Overall - 5,Resident Evil - Retribution
330,pgunnarsson,Most likely the worst movie ever!,1,30 December 2012,"First I must say that this review contains spoilers in the sense that I quickly describe what this movie is about: This movie is about a couple of people who are completely invincible, fighting other people who are easier to kill than a wingless fly. With some exceptions... who they are you'll have to find out for yourself is you decide to waste the time.It's amazing that Milla and her friends seems to be completely pass through in this movie, with thousands of bullets going straight through them without doing any harm. If the bad guys aren't shooting blanks? And also every weapon in this movie seems to have unlimited ammunition. I thought the directors had learned to stop making the 70s and 80s shootouts?In this movie you will also be delighted to see a car-chase a'la 80s B-movies and zombies with machine guns and by the way, these zombies can walk, apparently think and drive cars but no one taught them how to aim. I mean... AT ALL!I am a great fan of the old Res evil games and I loved the first movie. It was completely brilliant. The second one was somewhat good to, even if I was surprised they chose to make it an action movie. The third one was mediocre and the forth one was flat out bad. But this movie... this one I wish I never saw.Ps. I almost laughed my ass of in the scene with the zombie army. It reminded me of Hotshots 2 with Charlie Sheen when he invincibly stands in a mountain of empty cartridges shooting bad guys...",Resident Evil - Retribution
331,dakamurratute,an Alice sandwich already ROTTEN..,1,26 September 2012,"well i am a fan of the video games saga, not from the movies, i 'played all the games etc. then in 2002 the first resident evil movie comes out and was OK, at least enjoyable, then the second one was fine.. till the middle of it, but when nemesis appear and turn to be good and even not mutate, the movie transform in a totally crap , from that moment the movies are so bad that are a joke, this movie isn't the esception, the characters are far far away from the videogames counterparts, this movie is bad made, contain the worst acting of all the saga, the cheapest effects ever made, and the plot holes are so big than the entire universe, and nothing is well explain, besides the situations on the afterlife movie, has not effect on this one, I don't want ad spoilers, but the fail is so big that dragon ball movie is the best movie ever compare to this, in this sequel characters like crhis and claire are never mentioned, and anybody says nothing about it, others take they spot, but not for to long, alice continue stealing the aspects from the others heroes, and doing it all by herself. At the end there is cliffhanger for more, so if you respect the resident evil games don't watch it save your money, and wait a reboot... is the only hope we can get.. anyway there isn't hope for paul anderson....",Resident Evil - Retribution
332,scott_1589,Resident Evil: Retribution is by far the best sequel in the series,7,14 September 2012,"I've followed the Resident Evil film series since it started in 2002. I am also a big fan of the video game series and have played and finished every main game in the series since it started way back in 1996. Trust me when I say I am a fan and take my word for it. This is the best Resident Evil film to come out since the 2002 original.Now let me start by saying that I prefer the video games over the films. But I'm fine with the main character Alice being an exclusive character to the movies and the films being set in separate universe. In fact I've always argued against the idea that movies should be set out EXACTLY like the games. Where is the fun in that? These movies are meant to be a different version to the games universe. Comic books do it all the time.Resident Evil: Retribution is not to be taken too seriously. The movie is meant to be fun and thrilling and it succeeds! It has the thrilling jump scares and tense moments known from the original and 'Extinction' and the campy fun factor of 'Apocalypse'. While the 4th entry Resident Evil: Afterlife's special effects, stunts and camera work were impressive, its story served as bridge between 'Extinction' and 'Retribution'. It followed up on 'Extinctions' main plot points while setting up the 5th film with a cliffhanger. Unfortunately I thought 'Afterlife' was the worst entry in the series though, even though i found it quite enjoyable.Paul W.S Anderson takes 'Afterlife's direction and does everything right this time round with 'Retribution'. The slow-motion isn't over the top this time and the action sequences are so much better. The plot isn't AMAZING, but THERE IS A PLOT! MINOR SPOILERS: Alice is held prisoner in an Umbrella Facility until a a spy and a elite squad move in to rescue her. It sounds like a recreation of the first film, and trust me there is plenty of homage to it. But 'Retribution' is much more imaginative this time around as it uses more monsters from the video games and makes use of the quirks exclusive to the series such as 'the clones' and 'Alices Gift'. Characters dead from the previous films make a return. The whole film works so well as a sequel because it mixes elements of nostalgia along with fantastic stunt work and special effects.This film rocks. Its the best sequel in the series! If you want to know how I rank them 1:Resident Evil 2.Retribution 3.Extinction 4:Apocalypse and 5:Afterlife. I'm a fan of great plots in films, and the trick is not to take these Resident Evil films too seriously. Give 'Retribution' a go its a lot of fun!",Resident Evil - Retribution

Honestly did not expect to be so disappointed in one of my favourite franchises. The film on a whole seemed so pointless, the whole film could of been shortened into a 15 minute opening to a proper sequel instead of a long boring no script, pointless action and horrible story.*Spoilers*The addition of fan favourite characters had us all eagerly awaiting this film only to be slapped in the face by the writers. Almost everyone dies or is a clone whoopy do! There is no decent bad guys, one steroid abusing licker appears briefly for another pointless sequence, again thanks to the writers for making one of my favourite video game enemies a pointless on screen joke.I could go on for ages but writing on a tablet isn't that easy5/10 is a bias rating due to me being a fanboy of the series, i would of rated it 3/10 if i was new to the franchise.All in watch but don't expect a lot.Nikolas Zelentchuk",Resident Evil - Retribution
335,mislagle,No Bueno... SMH,2,14 September 2012,"I love the Resident Evil films. Sure, they are campy, but they are always fun and are usually a great action flick.Retribution is absolutely not the case. Does it have lots of action? Yes, but when you have such a weak plot line as is showcased here not even GOOD action can save it. Even the action scenes themselves are horrendous, with mediocre at best special effects in most parts and ludicrous scenarios that never play well off of one another, not to mention the 20 page script for the entire film. The only lines delivered all seem like they were a Jr. High film project, and add nothing to the story except one liners and catchphrases.All in all, this film is easily on my top 10 worst films of all time list, and I doubt many things will surpass it in the future.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I have played the games and I am fully aware that the movies are not really faithful to the games but does not mean the movie will be an automatic failure.These franchise is not the greatest but it's entertaining and every time I watch the movies I have a good time. They are mostly unrealistic and inaccurate but it's fun to watch and at the end of the day that's what your looking for.Now, about this last movie I have to say, from my point of view, this is by far the best one out of the series. Tons of action, zombies, shooting, fighting and nonsense that would leave you satisfied. Glad to have Michelle back, she definitely made the movie better. Definitely looking forward for the next movie and hopefully Paul can somehow bring Michelle back...hey, this movie is pure fiction/fantasy so anything is possible.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Yeah right! I don't understand why this movie is categorized under horror movies. I was laughing half the time. And everything was predictable(also no one talks much in this movie anyway).Other than opening credits scene, there nothing interesting to watch. There is no story so I can not even spoil it for anyone. Just nice CGI does not make a movie great. This movie, as I said in title of the review, is horror of movie making. Video games have better story lines than this. Ah.. had to get it off my head. I am not going to watch any Resident Evil movies in future. The group of friends who went to watch this movie is nodding in agreement as I am writing this. If you must watch it, then wait for HBO to show it. At least you will have good time laughing at the predictable action scenes.TL;DR Horrible movie, anyone who says otherwise is a teenager or watching horror movies for first time.",Resident Evil - Retribution
339,gileleven,Ouch,3,5 March 2013,"Where to begin, I really don't know, it was awful from start to finish. By far the worst of all Resident Evil's movies, despite the fact the last one (Afterlife) was already very bad, with its abrupt ending in the middle of a scene engraved in my memory. Well this one starts as bad as the other one finished, yes I know, it's a pretty hard thing to do but they managed to do it. It starts with a playback of the intro scene followed by, guess what, the intro scene played normally. Pure geniusThis wasn't the only problem with the movie, no, it had a lots of problems. First of all the directing isn't very good, but what strikes out is the screenplay's lack of quality, I mean really bad. Dialogues are simple, boring and often pointless and then the storyline is also very flawed, it's like someone wrote this movie's script in just about a day. So that you can understand some of my issues with this movie, and despite me being a fan of Resident Evil (mainly the first movies), I'll mention a couple of them. For instance, those cool looking Umbrella secret labs that are built underground and are shown as a 3D schematic, well in this movie there is one of those but its layout, unlike previous labs, makes no sense what so ever. I mean, why would someone build a lab in which you have to cross 3 or 4 cities full of zombies just to get in and get out, makes no sense. Then there is the appearance of all the previous characters, I was surprised how Nemesis doesn't show up All these past characters where cloned, just because, and now they come back, not as themselves but as someone else and, has that wasn't bad enough, they have really poor roles in the movie.If all that didn't suffice to rate this movie very poorly, there's the cherry on top of the cake: bad acting. No great actors were in this movie but some stood out, like Sienna Guillory, who plays Jill and I'm sorry to say this but can't act at all, her idiotic commands (brilliant script) during the whole movie were ridiculous, or Milla Jovovich using the same hand gesture to say 2 completely different things to her deaf daughter (not sure if she was deaf or not, but why else would she speak in sign language).In the end, after hour and a half, after all the shooting, shouting and running around, the only thing that was added to this franchise was a secret lab located underwater and blown up and the end of the movie, so nothing was added. A pointless movie and a bad one as well. Oh I almost forgot, you also find out that the next movie will take place in Washington where the White House is the last standing building and zombies are beating the crap out of everyone (my 2 cents: it doesn't seem it's going to be a better movie than this).All in all, even if you aren't picky with things like the sign language ""dialogs"" this is still an extremely bad movie and a continued fall into the abyss this movie franchise seems to have entered in 2007 with Extinction kind of looking down from the edge of the precipice.",Resident Evil - Retribution
340,libertycity123,Worst movie of all Resident Evil films...,4,21 January 2013,"I think it's safe to say that it is getting boring and annoying to hear the same lines over and over in the beginning of the movie. We already know that Umbrella Corp is evil and the virus made the dead come back alive, etc. We don't need Alice to tell us that for each Resident Evil movie released, seriously - we get it.Now for the plot, it's a simple plot - to get out of that submarine place alive. I don't see how some reviewers say there isn't a plot or a storyline. For character development, this movie has done a terrible, terrible job. I was offended when they showed Leon out of nowhere...it would've been nice had the director or writers for this movie developed him much better, along with Ada Wong. Throughout the movie, we're introduced to pretty much everyone, but then we focus mainly on Alice and we completely forget about the bad guys. Everything feels so rushed, shifting from one place to another. I feel like this film was directed towards a video game cut scene as a few reviewers mentioned. That little girl, Becky who was ""supposedly"" Alice's daughter, but isn't because memories were implemented to the clones....her character was not necessary at all. Just sayin'.For the special effects, it's just as good as every other RE film. The infinite ammunition, the massive spraying, bad guys firing bullets everywhere but directly at the good guys. The order that was given to the bad guys was ""shoot to kill"" not ""shoot to miss"". Good guys, of course, never miss. NEVER.Personally, I liked the first and second Resident Evil film. There was a nice flow to it, but ever since Extinction, everything just felt like sh*t hit the fan hard.4/10 solely because of cool effects, Leon, Ada, Luther West. I'm sure there will be one more Resident Evil movie.",Resident Evil - Retribution
341,richithekiller,All guns blazing.,7,14 September 2012,"OK we don't go to see RE movies for their insight into the human condition, we go to check our brains in at the door and be entertained for just shy of 90 mins. On this level Retribution is a good fun night out with great 3D and plenty of action. It's fun to see almost all the characters from the franchise back, thanks to the Umbrella cloning programme and Ada, Leon and Barry from the games should please hardcore fans.Retribution really doesn't offer anything new, Milla is Alice and if she remembers anything at all she probably will have a feeling of deja-vu from the previous instalments but the movie barrels along from one gory, action set-piece to another without giving the audience too long to worry about how ridiculous it all is. Dressed almost identically to Selene from Underworld Milla looks great back-flip kicking zombies, rescuing the surrogate daughter and wearing two small towels again.The action comes thick and fast with our various heroes running from the little girl Red Queen through various virtual reality zones including Moscow, Tokyo, American Suburbia and finally up top to the frozen Russian Sub dock.All in all the movie delivers a undeniably fun but generic experience to the other films so if you're a fan, you probably will enjoy it and on the big screen in 3D is the only way to go.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I am a fan of the first three movies but since Afterlife it became so ridiculous. There is no spoil in my review because there is nothing hard-hitting about Retribution, it is a simple unpacking of play-lets of action. Alice is always in the center of everything, the characters are only set. I really hope that the next comments will know how to criticize the movie as it is necessary, we can be a fan of the movies but defend this opus it is simply impossible. We can emit only one positive point: we are not bored. Ridiculous is the word which would summarize Retribution. In the others we took some pleasure to follow Alice's adventures. This time it is just a big joke, Leon, Ada, Barry and even Jill are useless. I even cannot spoil so much there is nothing interesting! Even the action is average, it is more a movie of fight than a Resident Evil. Find the movie on the internet and avoid paying.",Resident Evil - Retribution
343,MovieCritic1999,Better Worth Renting *SPOILER*,4,18 September 2012,"Was really anxious to see this movie. I've played the videos games and loved the RE1-3 movie establishments. RE4 was OK, but I'm sorry to say this one seemed like a colossal joke. **Spoilers** It really seemed like a child had written and directed the movie. The idea of the movie I thought was perfect. I could see umbrella developing the simulation site to sell to governments. The beginning of the movie was really great, but then the acting started to seem to fall apart and the creative seemed more like, OK what can we throw at this movie? Several issues I had were the nazi zombies/ soviet soldier zombies (why couldn't it just be regular zombies? and have the recovery team be over run as raccoon city was in 2, it would've still killed off recovery team members), the constant slow motion (it would've been great to see a lot of that fast just like in the neighborhood scene), the cheesy one liners, Barry getting shot, getting back up to shoot again, Leon touching Ada's leg when they showed no love interest in the entire movie, Barry seemed to care more. I give it a 4 for the good idea of bringing back older characters, merging it with characters from the gaming world, and a decent plot. I could see how a younger crowd would enjoy this, but they could've still made it more serious and pleased everyone to where the arguments would just be over the story.",Resident Evil - Retribution

There is no plot, sub-plot or any kind of storyline what so ever. The fact that a movie doesn't make sense isn't what bothers me, the very least it must have a beginning and an end (or something).

To say the least I was let down by this movie. It had no suspense or drama and was all shoot outs and fights. I understand that this is considered a sort of action movie and guns and fights are what those make up...however this movie had no ""meat"" to it. It was completely visual. I never felt the danger...I was never even close to the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next...it was very predictable. During the second half of the movie people in the theater were laughing at the action scenes and how ridiculously stupid they were. I left the theater very disappointed with a critical opinion of the movies director. If you still want to see it I recommend waiting for it on DVD so you don't waste the price of a theater ticket...",Resident Evil - Retribution
351,raphael-15-581089,Games have better stories than this.,3,10 February 2014,"Many people compare it to video games (in general), which is wrong because video games these days have much better stories than Resident Evil: Retribution. Personally, I never watched previous Resident Evil movies for story, as shallow as it was.. it was enjoyable, and felt right. In this case, it is awful. In Blu-Ray commentary Paul W.S. Anderson said that ""he wanted to keep the franchise fresh"", little he knows that this kind of experimentation could actually kill the franchise. And he was not even that innovative, because movie felt (suspiciously) similar to ""Sucker Punch"". I just hope that producers, and franchise owners read reviews, and next movie will be much better (if they get the financing). They should not even change the director, because Paul W.S. Anderson can direct good movies (""Resident Evil"", and ""Resurection"" were my favorite movies in the franchise).",Resident Evil - Retribution
352,Jamie-Grant,"Stupid, Stupid... Did I mention STUPID?",1,21 October 2012,"Dreadful, from start to finish. The opening scene played backwards, which I thought was pretty cool, exposing the audience to the plot. I said to myself ""I really don't want to see this again played forward""... Low and behold, the entire sequence I JUST WATCHED played again in normal speed. Bullets didn't hit anyone, the Umbrella goons died almost exactly the same way every time, characters (or rather actors) were wooden, just a god awful film!The plot... let's face it, there was no plot. ""Escape from this massive Umbrella facility, by the way your friend is being brainwashed and will try to kill you."" It felt very forced, like the script writers had run out of ideas, but Milla Jovovich hadn't run out of bullets yet.The ending was bizarre, lazy and just plain silly. Rain, from the first film, reappears as a clone and is injected with some sort of worm. This worm allows her to bare sub-zero temperature without injury, literally PUNCH PEOPLE'S HEARTS, STOPPING THEM, dodge bullets... whatever.Then we cut to the Whitehouse, where Wesker has become the President. Not surprised. It appears this is humanity's last ditch attempt to save itself from the undead hordes.... Wait a f*ucking minute - Umbrella has the resources to maintain hundreds of high tech facilities around the globe, command airship squadrons, clone FREAKING SOLDIERS, and is still locked in a battle with the undead?! And to top it off, what can only be described as ZOMBIE DRAGONS appear at the end.

Paul Anderson is the new Uwe Boll.",1,29 September 2012,"When I first heard of the first Resident Evil movie, I was very excited. However, upon seeing the film, I gave up on ever having a decent movie for the games. My girlfriend wanted to see this one and she had to drag me kicking and screaming. I haven't seen any of the others and I didn't need to which is a red flag right there given It's the 5th installment. First up, the acting was deplorable and not once did I believe anybody. I have been a theater major for 8 years so seeing any movie where the filmmakers don't bother hiring believable actors is disappointing. Second, the special effects were laughable, which is strange considering that their budget was well within working range (keep a special eye out for the scene where the man gets cut up by the chainsaw and tell me you can keep a straight face). Third, if you are a fan of the games, this movie continues to pretend that the games never happened, except for some characters. They add a couple characters into the movie from the games but never explain any of them, they are just thrown in to say ""hey, look fan boys we played the games too and to prove it, here's a few characters!"" So, even if you pretend that this isn't based on the games (which is easy if you just forget the title), then this movie is just different shots of action sequences spliced together in whatever lazy order the director wanted. If follows no kind of logical pattern or storyline, which again as a theater major I find incredibly irritating. I'm a fan of the games but I'm more upset that I actually paid money to see the movie over the fact that It's not actually based on the games.",Resident Evil - Retribution

The true Resident Evil lover will probably not agree instantly, perhaps I'm being too critical. I do, however, not agree with the way-too-melodramatic critics about not understanding even a bit, or saying the acting was bad. I have to say though the acting wasn't perfect. It was OK.Everyone who doubts about seeing Retribution: Do NOT listen to the critics, just go see it and judge for yourself.Overall, I am excited for people to see the fifth installment and I recommend it to everyone.

355,modeyv,Pointless Film,4,17 September 2012,"All i can say for the positives of this film are the CG parts. Anything else that is part of this movie is a disgrace to the resident evil franchise. Looks like the films and games of the resident evil franchise have just fallen to a new low. This film has bad editing, one fight scene, i felt my eyes hurting due to the choppy editing, most of the acting is awful, i could not stand it. The script is stupid and wants us to care for undeveloped characters with parts that just seem too rushed and skipped. Also the main antagonist of this film (Red Queen) just keeps popping up and it seems really cheesy when she does, as they follow the antagonists through the scenes.Overall, instead of spending money on a piece of s**t action movie (Which will definitely get bad reviews and make a profit) , they should invest in a reboot of the whole franchise, creating a much darker and scarier film. Preferably based off Resident Evil 4 (The Game) and lose all of the stupid writing and pointless action. They also need to get a good actor for Lyon, as the actor in this movie was horrible and had too much muscle on him.It is a B movie at best, due to all the pointless action and CGI, but other than that it has taken a new route of stupid in the Resident Evil franchise.",Resident Evil - Retribution

After all, this series has been great barring the previous one.The icing on the cake was the Umbrella Corp head asking Alice to help him, after she went against them in the complete series so far !! Now, the ending this movie got, I wonder they might come up with another one in a year or two and this zombie-war will be never-ending one ;)The opening sequence is too good, movie is worth watching only because of 3D effects.

If it was just another one of the crappy action movies I'd blame myself for a bad choice, but what makes this one worse is the fact that it's a Resident Evil film, from the previous ones I expected this one at least nothing less. Like most of other reviews said, there's no plot whatsoever and acting was so LAME bunch of unqualified amateurs I feel sorry for Milla Jovovich too this film just downgraded her so much. I really wonder what the producer and director were thinking when they making the film. It feels like as if they were absent-minded or couldn't care less.

The movie has no plot, no character building and is just plain awful. There isn't really anything that we haven't seen before, the monsters are the same, the objective for Alice is the same and all I was hoping to happen while watching this movie is that there must be more once she gets out of this place, there must be at least some kind of story in this movie.. but no.The thing that really killed this movie for me were the actors chosen to play Leon and Barry, Leon looking like an action-man with a wig and Barry looking nothing like he does in the games.

362,James_Blake,"Short, fast-paced and visually impressive, RE:Retribution is a fifth installment that really works.",10,12 September 2012,"The Resident Evil movies have always received criticism from not only snob critics but also fans for not following the video game's storyline. Nobody expected the original movie to actually be more of a prequel to the games with made up characters and starring Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. Critics' hated it. Gamers hated it. Yet the general public's response was actually quite good. Looking back, that movie had its flaws but was very enjoyable and intense. Anderson managed to create a claustrophobic atmosphere whilst providing enough doses of action. The story was not really important at this point and Anderson played with the audience throughout the movie, making Jovovich's Alice a character very easy to sympathize with.The sequels, however, did not provide enough character moments or story and opted to turn the franchise into a mindless action disaster. Even though the third entry (Extinction) managed to improve on the character development and story department(thanks to Mullcahy's direction)the craziness was still the spotlight. All these positive aspects were then thrown completely away in the fourth installment. The story was all over the place, the audience cared more for the undead than for the characters, the action goes from crazy to ""WTH?"" and so on.Now these movies are enjoyable no matter what. Even Afterlife was fun to watch for its stupidity and craziness. It is a shame because something really good could have been made after the original since there was so much potential. Resident Evil: Retribution is not different than the three sequels but does mostly everything MUCH better. First, Anderson makes sure he brings back the best characters the franchise has had in the past movies connecting Retribution with the first entries. He then provides the movie with a simple but interesting story (in a similar way to the original), immersive 3D, over the top action sequences and outstanding visuals.Retribution is the ""Fast Five"" of the Resident Evil franchise. It may not be the best but it is a very decent sequel that fans will absolutely love, the general public will enjoy and critics will hate with a passion.The movie is as short as the others but is incredibly fast-paced with non-stop action. There are many continuity issues and plot holes but after four movies, you know exactly what you're going to get and be prepared for Retribution to exceed your expectations. This is no masterpiece. There are no strong performances or a deep story with original ideas. This is a fifth installment in an mindless action zombie franchise and in that aspect, you CAN'T get better than this. It is certainly better than all the sequels as it manages to restore the sensible elements from the original (some jump scares and tense moments included!) whilst keeping the insanity and absurdity of the sequels.Short, fast-paced and visually impressive, RE:Retribution is a fifth installment that really works.8/10",Resident Evil - Retribution
363,plantmanknowswhereplants,"Great action movie, don't expect slow dialog.",7,19 September 2012,"Milla Jovovich returns in Resident Evil Retribution, along with Michelle Rodriguez(Rain), Sienna Guillory( Jill Valentine) From the fourth movie, and Boris Kodjoe as Luther West from the second and third movies to name a few. I enjoyed the returning cast, Michelle Rodriguez has been one of my favorites that has been absent from every movie except the first one and whom I felt played a very compelling role in the TV series Lost.The plot takes some reading between the lines, and I think an understanding that certain details are ultimately left out of the movie to build suspense for a later sequel, or at least I got that feel from a few details that were left open ended by the end of the movie. The movie does explain the previous movies in an acceptably short time frame to give just enough details so that a first time viewer can pick up on the Resident Evil story ""so far"" however I strongly recommend viewing the previous movies first for any new comers to the series.There aren't a lot of character conflicts, There aren't a lot of overly long drawn out emotional scenes. I think these are all fine oversights because the movie focuses on what it is supposed to do and does well: Lots of action. It seemed like every moment of the movie something was happening to the point where there was no reason to slow down and clutter it up with a long dialog scene here or there. It was paced well, wasn't drawn out to long, and changed enough to avoid becoming tedious.I thought the movie was okay on plot, it did enough to be a movie and support the action. It scattered in some new details about Umbrella and it's opposition. I felt like a few details were intentionally left out for sequel(s), and like the other Resident Evil movies this one also ends on a cliff hanger.I think some of the other action movies this year have been a bit of a snooze because they tried to hard to be epic in every way with big dramatic characters and big dramatic dialogs, this movie picked action and did it well.

364,schoen-marcel,Truly frightful horror - for the viewer,2,6 February 2013,"As a fan of the ""old"" RE-games I was always somewhat disappointed by the movies, but the first 3 may just pass as popcorn movies of their own, the 3rd one even having a distinct own atmosphere and being just and enjoyable overall on its own. But from there, this franchise goes downhill lightning-fast. The last movie was already stupid beyond comprehension, the story didn't make any sense at all anymore, and characters and scenes from the RE games were inserted randomly just to create some connection to the games that didn't really exist at all.But why bash the last RE movie, when this one is so much worse? I truly, honestly believe that it can't get any worse, except maybe if Uwe Boll takes over the franchise. Apart from the Hollywood-Level production values (special effects etc.), the whole ""RE: Contribution"" movie reeks of lack of competence and interest. The writing and pacing is abysmal, the whole movie is literally just a series of action scenes with no meaningful plot to connect them all; worse, many of those scenes are cringe-worthy and painful to watch, because they're so ridiculous, and many actors are playing like robots on sedatives; I've never seen a worse performance from Michelle Rodriguez; she must have been ashamed to be part of this catastrophe. And don't get me started about Sienna Guillory (Jill Valentine); someone please tell her to get a new job outside the movie business!! The only slightly redeeming factor was Milla Jovovich; while not really a great actress, she performs as good as she can, and is pretty much the only person to convey some actual emotion sometimes.Don'get me wrong, I like corny, simple action movies in general, but this is just not acceptable anymore. I think Anderson must have been forced at gunpoint to make this movie; that's how I felt while sitting through it. I only watched it to the end to see if there would be at least ONE good plot idea at some point, but to no avail.Don't watch it if you don't have to, no matter how much of a ""Resident Evil"" fan you are; this just isn't worth the time.",Resident Evil - Retribution

You will not understand the movie if you don't see the movies that lead up to Retribution. The plot may not be the best, but the action and the graphics, the 3D, everything that was filmed turned out to look and be amazing. It's as simple as this: If you watch the earlier movies and don't like them, don't see this movie. If you are a fan and like/love every single movie in the franchise, definitely go see it! I'm not joking. If you have NOT seen the other movies, you most likely will not understand nor like this movie. In my own personal judgement, I thought this movie is the best of all the sequels, and I definitely hope they make a sixth one! So, if you haven't seen any of the Resident Evil movies, go watch them. If you like them, go see this one. If you don't, don't see this movie. Simple as that. As far as my review of this movie goes, I LOVE IT. I love Milla Jovovich and the rest of the characters. I love that every movie brings those fighting scenes that are just INCREDIBLE. This fifth movie definitely has THE BEST and the most fighting scenes with other characters and the infected!

And also for the return of Rain and Jill Valentine, this last one, we saw her in a short scene at Resident Evil: Afterlife. But the absence of Claire and Chris Redfield was a pity. We lose the human part, the part that we were also related to. We're not just related to Alice, we were also related to Chris and Claire.

'Cause I do, the things that are always changing are the action scenes, that's why we don't realize of the monotony that the movie has, but the inclusion of that big monster, was a really good shot!!

But is Milla Jovovich who steals the show and has established itself as one of the greatest actresses of action cinema. His Alice is the soul of Resident Evil, and is even more comfortable in character. With mastery, the actress gives a show of girl power and performance.In the first film, the characters followed by claustrophobia Beehive. With a more elaborate script and betting on terror to scare the audience with a few doses of action and characters more depth, it is still the best of them. Since then, the franchise began to exchange terror for action - betting on the cliché ""more is better"".'Resident Evil 2: Apocalypse' Alice showed a genetically altered with super-powers, walking the night streets of Raccoon City, fighting not only against zombies, but also against other aberrations more ""evolved"" and deadly. The film presented the beloved Jill Valentine, but not wowed.In Resident Evil 3: Extinction 'director Russell Mulcahy was able to resume the reins of the franchise, creating an interesting post-apocalyptic world and a Las Vegas desolate. The production was a bit better than the last, and presented Claire Redfield, Jill left in place (without much explanation).'Resident Evil 4: afterlife' was again directed and scripted by Anderson, who wrote a vulgar and superficial plot, hoping to unite all the outlandish action scenes with little dialog. The result was a range of characters shallow, betting on 3D effects. Neither the presence of the brethren Redfield managed to save the production.'Resident Evil 5: Retribution' (Resident Evil: Retribution), again written and directed by Paul W. S. Anderson, can regain the quality of the first film, and features a plot slightly more evolved than the last.The film begins with Alice exactly where we last saw the end of Resident Evil 4: Restart - on the deck of the mysterious ship Arcadia, where she hoped to find more survivors of the epidemic.But in reality, what awaits is a battle of his life, when his former ally, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory), and a squadron of helicopters terrible V-22 of the Umbrella Corporation approaching with orders to shoot to kill .Alice awakens in the heart of Umbrella's clandestine operations, and discovers more secrets of his mysterious past as delves into the complex. Without a safe haven, Alice continues to hunt those responsible for the virus, a chase that takes her from Tokyo to New York, Washington, DC and Moscow, culminating in a mind-blowing revelation that will force her to rethink everything she believed to be true .With a frantic pace, all scenes are loaded with zombies, explosions, monsters, shootings and fights. It's difficult to breathe between one sequence and another, since the great 3D takes you into the screen.This is what most resembles the games: the Red Queen commands the action, announcing where the protagonists will then separating the battles in stages where characters must dodge enemies - like La Plagas and the Axemen. Just one joystick to get you into the action.Anderson came up with an ingenious way of bringing back characters who had suffered brutal deaths in the previous films, including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez, and always great playing several characters) and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory in acting weak and full of catchphrases). Carlos (Oded Fehr, great), Luther West (Boris Kodjoe, good) and Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) also return in style.Who gives a show is China's Li Bingbing ('The Forbidden Kingdom'), who lives Ada Wong, Wesker agent that fights alongside Alice. Very comfortable in the role, she will win over fans of the games and movies. Johann Urb also shows great talent as Leon Scott Kennedy.The sequence in which Alice appears as a simple housewife in the suburbs is the best, showing that what is missing is the action excessive leave aside and return to the horror genre - Anderson seems to know that driving with more wisdom.'Resident Evil 5: Retribution' will appeal to fans of the franchise and action movies, with breathtaking sequences and doses of suspense and laughs volunteers - but starts to show some wear.

Seriously this movie is amazing i highly recommend it, and it makes me wish they released a sequel already! This movie is awesome and any person to say otherwise is just a pompus fat bloak that doesn't even have friends so they go on the internet to attempt and ruin the image of a perfectly awesome movie. I guess the future of movies is going to be bleak for everyone if the majority of sheep humans cant even enjoy a good movie when they make one. These losers will always find something to complain about because they want to feel heard, feel important, or feel betrayed. The series started off as a video game, so i really cant understand someone who calls themselves a fan why would they complain about the plot line being like a video game? That just means they actually aren't REAL fans of the series at all! Resident evil promises to keep you wanted for more and thats a garantee, take it from me. This movie has HUGE replay value. And pls don't take someone elses unjust opinion of the film if you have not seen it yourself. And to all the haters, if you don't like this movie than clearly you were NEVER a real fan of the series anyway, perhaps just a fanboy following some fad.

It made you think that Alice would be going from one country to another with a huge vendetta as her motivation. Incorrect.

Well, they are, but as villains. Permanently. Basically, they fooled you with the trailers into thinking the movie would have completely different setting directions. The plot direction is also different compared to the trailers: Albert Wesker is not a villain, but a protagonist throughout the entire film. The Red Queen is the villain once more.Even though they mislead you this way, if you love action and violence(and Milla Jovovich), you'll get a good kick. If you love a well-structured movie, it'll only be so-so. If you're a Resident Evil franchise fan, you will hate it for ""being original"". Good thing I love Milla more than the video game. :PSpecial Effects: A (counting the 3-D moments) Music Score: A Plot: C Cast: B Buyable Movie: Maybe",Resident Evil - Retribution
374,neil-pimblett15,Waste of time,2,30 November 2012,"To be honest this film is a complete yawn-fest from the beginning to the end. TOTALLY unrealistic action scenes do little to improve a boring and tedious plot line.A film too far, by far. Have always found previous films in the series to be entertaining (in a rather mindless way), and have been worth the watch, but I am sorry to say that this film does not follow this pattern in anyway.Although having polished CGI, these do little to improve the film with its wafer-thin plot line. You just sit there in the action scenes bored to tears as you have seen it all before.A film for hard-core Resident Evil fans only I fear and there are far better films out there than this to spend your valuable time watching.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I can't understand how anyone could let this movie go out to public like this! I really loved RE 1-3 but they started messing up on RE4 and now they really hit rock bottom!! The writer seems to be dumb in order to write that! I don't even know if he wrote anything or everyone just went along with it.. Seems so stupid! I hope the next movie will go to someone who is not a complete retard and will write something good. I mean come on, I can write better than that, and even my 6 yo son has better imagination! Watch this movie so you can understand the frustration!",Resident Evil - Retribution
376,DocHSn,Kindly remove this movie from the horror genre....,7,23 September 2012,The movie is opposite to its title name.... Not even a single horror scene only action and action .... i don't understand if you are making a horror movie then why you made such action scenes besides horror scenes.....action was really very awesome but they should added some horror and suspense scenes...Another big issue about the Zombies ... viewer want to see lots of zombies but in this movie there is just 2 big zombies and some zombie armies which is not so clear .....otherwise there is a war between human and clone ...In case of characters i really appreciate that they brought some original RE game play characters like Leon and Ada but both was looking sidekick although they are the main character in game play....Hope in RE6 they put more zombies more horror thriller and suspense scenes with all these characters ..,Resident Evil - Retribution
377,crazypunk51,Wow... what a piece of trash!,3,6 March 2013,"I don't even know what to say about this film, because it made no sense, I can't even write any spoilers because it was so jumbled and hard to follow. My concern is why they have decided to release another one of these into a flailing series, which clearly needs to go. Special effects were good, the fight scenes were good but nothing new, so all in all, if you have seen any of the resident evil films already don't bother with this one. This film is what I like to call easily forgotten. Evidently the makers of this clap trap just want to continue the series so they can make a buck or million, because this film was made with no effort, I can't believe that these actors and actresses are no fed up of this by now.",Resident Evil - Retribution
378,unclehosh,I do not understand all the negative reviews.,9,15 September 2012,"Resident Evil Retribution is not a bad movie. I have seen action movies that are much worse. Instead, this movie moves too quickly for people to understand the brilliant subtleties underneath. On the surface, the 3d is fantastic, the action sequences are brilliantly choreographed, and the storyline is sold. Many would argue otherwise, saying that the acting is terrible, and the writing is pathetic. However, the main characters are being shot at. Sure, there is a lack of development, but that is the point. This is the end of the world. People are not safe, and Anderson wanted that to be clear. The acting is poor on the part of Li Bingbing and Sean Roberts, but Milla Jovovich brings real emotion to her part. One scene with her ""daughter"" in which she sacrifices herself after shedding a single tear left me speechless. And the opening shot in the water with an almost holy light representing Alice as the savior of mankind shows that there is a little more to this movie than people realize. Paul Anderson will not hold your hand through it or give you a reason why zombies can wield guns. And who can aruge against it. It's science FICTION. This is not a realistic movie, and people need to understand that. I enjoyed this movie, and despite its flaws, the soundtrack, fight scenes, and storyline were enough to sell me.",Resident Evil - Retribution
379,cnrivera07,Short but sweet,7,20 September 2012,"The only quarrel I have with this movie is the cliffhanger and I mean SERIOUS cliffhanger. I almost died it hurt me so much lol. the reason that even the bad reviewers say they want to see the next movie is because of the ending here.Everyone is so stuck on the video game that they don't realize that no one wants to see a complete duplicate of what they've already played through. The extra clones surviving was rather random but such a great addition. Unrealistic zombies? You all forget that Resident Evil is nothing but a virus gone wild - even the games follow that much. Since that is an unpredictable turn, anything that happens in the movie is still a strong possibility for the true storyline.I LOVE Becky, shes such a cutie pie and a strong addition to Alice's character, especially since she's deaf. She may ""officially"" be the ultimate weapon BUT she is as human as she can be with the knowledge of being a clone, and biologically modified, and virtually indestructible.Now people complain about Milla being married to the director and that's why Alice stays alive? Which main character from the game has died yet? None of them. They're all in RE:6 - including Wesker's ""son"". Wtf? A nice twist but geez.I've been a fan of the games AND the movies since they first came out and I am very happy with what I have seen and what I will hopefully be seeing in the future.",Resident Evil - Retribution
380,eyesfearguyu,Awful Movie,1,13 September 2012,"This movie is the worse thing that has come out in Cinema since Watchmen. First of all if you are trying to direct a movie based on a game please follow the plot if you cant do so, at least be close enough.This movie was outrageously embarrassing from a Resident Evil gaming fan, horrible casting milla has no part to do in the movie and the only reason she is here is cause of her husband directing the movie.How can you not have CHRIS REDFIELD play the lead role in any of the 5 ugly action filled silly movie ? Nothing about Claire barely anything given to poor Leon and its so sad Ada Wong plays more important role than the important characters. How the hell do you integrate Las Plagas without any knowledge about it ? I bet the next movie will have all the amazing scripts and monsters from Resident Evil 6 but the usual the director will mess it up :)I have way too many things to murder this horrible movie franchise but I will just skip it and tell you please who ever things the above reviews are decent, I would like to have what you are smoking",Resident Evil - Retribution

The story is little bit easy, director want to expend the story of resident evil to a serial. Better to enjoy it in the cinema with at lease 3D. In the end of the movie, there seems something between libingbing and the Russian guy. I think they may be the double face between red queen and boss. Most of the shoot remind me of the Call of duty, it is almost the same with the game, when they fright with the zombie in the restrant. The biggest surprise is the RR, can you believe that even 007 did not have that fancy car. the fright during the riding is so amazing . I like that extrodenery fighting.",Resident Evil - Retribution

This part has gone far far away from the first one.Now there's almost no suspense except the scene of zombie attack in suburbia, but amounts of action. The point is not just in kicking ass, it's in the way how they do it! Sense of humour and Rolls Royce rule! 3D is really great, especially in IMAX.Definitely better than the previous part.Weak plot line is the only disappointment.Extinction, Afterlife and Retribution reminds me of road movies. Heroes are moving from place to place and fight zombies in different locations.I hope they'll finally reach the destination point in next RE movie.Interesting and breathtaking,can't wait for the next one.",Resident Evil - Retribution

384,Wesker1213,"Overall, really great (spoilers).",10,16 September 2012,"Easily my 2nd favorite of the franchise, with Apocalypse being the first. The movie starts with a bit of a twist of sorts. Wesker is taking on an unfamiliar role as protagonist alongside Alice. Alice is captured by Umbrella and taken to an underwater facility in northern Russia. Alice escapes with Wesker's and Ada's help.This movie brings back a lot of familiar faces, and a few new ones. Has a lot of face-paced action sequences. Familiar foes from the game serious, and one of the best fight scenes of the entire franchise.Jill was particularly well played in this movie. I only wish Wesker had a much larger role.The way this one starts out with a recap of the first 4, makes even newcomers to the series easy to decipher what is going on.A must see.",Resident Evil - Retribution

One of the best elements for me was all the different environments (New York City, the suburbs, Moscow, Japan, etc.,). Excellent 3D effects, and the storyline pulled everything from the other movies together, at the same time, if you never saw any of the other movies you could enjoy this one without being lost. I want to go back and see it again on the big screen!Everyone looked great, plenty of eye candy (for guys and girls). To all the negative reviewers: We know this isn't ""Gone with the Wind"" with incredible acting and deep characters, it's about a wild ride and fast paced action and it delivers! Thanks to all involved in the making of Retribution!",Resident Evil - Retribution
386,potofgold_9,Hmm..,5,15 September 2012,"I have always loved the RE series, so as much as I hate to say it, this movie was kind of a let down compared to the rest. Most of the acting was terrible and very stiff and the characters had no real depth, I didn't even care when anyone died because they barley spoke or showed any emotion. Even with Alice I got a different vibe from the previous movies, she was a lot more stiff and her personality didn't really show. There were no real plot twists or ""wow"" moments for me. I felt like I was waiting the entire time for something awesome to happen and then it was just over.The action parts were good, but I think they focused way too much on making everything slow motion and a lot of it ended up looking cheesy.

Not having seen anything in the new 3D format I felt this action movie would be the one to showcase this technology. I was wrong. I found the 3D effects were most prominent on the periphery of the screen and distracted from the foreground action.As far as the film itself, little plot development to the franchise theme, pretty vapid dialog (when there is any dialog)and no character development. I enjoy action movies but can do without 90 minutes of frenetic action that does not really forward a story.Hollywood - Please return to story telling without all the unnecessary gimmicks.",Resident Evil - Retribution

The story is relatively simple but straightforward(in strong contrast to the last film), the action sequences are exciting and fun to watch, and Milla is well, Milla. It doesn't aspire to be more than a fun action movie, and Resident Evil Retribution delivers exactly that. Well worth your time, definitely the best of the RE films since the original classic. Rodriguez and the other guys do a nice job in their appearances in this film, and the decision to bring back Jill Valentine was definitely a plus. The movie isn't exactly original, certain elements of the storyline are basically plot devices from the first film that were rehashed & repackaged for Retribution. At the end of the day though, I didn't mind that at all. Anderson manages to deliver exactly what I was expecting, an exciting action- packed movie about a heroine who beats up on zombies. For what it sets out to do, Resident Evil: Retribution really does deliver.",Resident Evil - Retribution

390,blood-worth,"It's better than Afterlife, I'll give it THAT much.",4,16 September 2012,"The movie picks up where Afterlife left off, kind of. I say kind of because they start it off with a pointless slow motion rewind of the opening scene, before actually getting to it. Moving on, Alice, played by Milla Jovovich, has been recaptured by Umbrella. And she easily escapes. Seriously, with all the trouble Alice has put them through in the past, they don't seem all too interested in keeping her AFTER THEY FINALLY CAPTURE HER. Then we run into Ada, played by Bingbing Li, who is not working for Wesker, played by Shawn Roberts. Then we run into Leon Kennedy, by by Johann Urb, Barry Burton, played by Kevin Durand, and Luther West, played by Boris Kodjoe, who are also not working for Wesker. They also have two more people with them, but you shouldn't care about them, and clearly the movie doesn't either, since their names aren't even given to us before they're killed off. Seriously, I had to look it up to know their names, because the credits didn't have them either.The main problem with the film is that it makes no sense whatsoever. Everything that happens in the film could've easily been avoided by Umbrella by just killing or brainwashing Alice from the start. But no, they wait until she escapes to attempt to do anything about her. And by the way, why are they still making Alice clones when they had the original right there? Why not just stick one of those spider things on her chest and call it a day? Oh, right, because the plot says so. We also see the return of the Executioner, from Resident Evil 5. And you know what? It still doesn't make sense for him to be here. They were made with Uroboros, which was made from Las Plagas. Las Plagas was NOT made from the T-Virus! I wouldn't mind it so much, if the movie would AT LEAST explain what it IS, and WHERE it came from in the movie's universe. Only people who have played the games (Resident Evil 4 and 5, to be specific) will know what any of this stuff is, while non-fans will just be confused. We also have a Giant Licker (Just go with it), and zombie supersoldiers, I guess? Those weren't even IN the games!(Unless you count Resident Evil 5, but come on, you know as well I do that those guys were not zombies) The only people who have EVER heard about them are people who have read the Resident Evil books! Not the movie books, either. The (really hard to find) books that were based on the games.The special effects are nice, but the 3D is non-existent. If you're going to see this movie, save yourself the money, and stick with the 2D version. There's also far too much action. It's just scene after scene of non-stop action. That's alright, I guess. Nothing too wrong with that (though it's basically saying that if there's nothing going on, we're not interested), but there's very few scenes in which we start to care about the characters. That's already hard enough as it is. The best character in this regard is probably Becky, played by Aryana Engineer, who basically just exists for these scenes and to further the ongoing clone subplot. Everything in this movie is just wrong. If anything, Paul Anderson just played/saw someone playing the games and just took what he thought would make the best action scenes, regardless of whether or not it made sense for them to be there. If I have to say ONE good thing about this movie, it's that the action scenes are decent. If you go to see this movie for the action and nothing else, you'll be entertained the whole way through. Just don't expect much else.Acting 4.5/10 Story 4/10 Special Effects 4.5/10 Usage of 3D 3.5/10Overall 4/10",Resident Evil - Retribution

I really expected a lot from this movie; but I am sorry to say this disappointed me thoroughly!! The story was really crappy. Although the action sequences were fine but they were nothing extraordinary. There is nothing new in the movie. Not even at a single point did I feel glued to the movie. After 15-20 minutes into the movie I was really thinking why did I go for it? I think the resident evil series could have done without this sequel. To all those people who have been really waiting to go and watch this movie; well you people can wait for it to come on DVD and have a look then.

392,ironhead32,Spend your money elsewhere!,1,16 September 2012,"I first like to say that I am a fan of the Resident Evil Franchise. I've watched all the movies and played all the games. That being said, this movie is horrible. The whole movie seems like a opening scene, just bullets and explosions for 95 minutes.The new characters are forced, the dialogue is horrible. The only reason anyone seemed to like this movie was because they got to stare at Mila for an hour and a half. If all you want is to stare at Mila use a Google images search.They could have cut this whole movie down to 20 minutes and given us a real story for the next hour. But that would require writing a decent script. If the dialogue in this movie was more that 20 pages I would be surprised.How any one can defend this movie baffles me. Please spend your money elsewhere, if I could go back in time I would watch something else. You can wait until it's on Netflix, trust me. If they make money on this film they will continue to puke out this drivel banking on fan loyalty.This movie was a serious disappointment.",Resident Evil - Retribution

OK apart from the fact that the Red queens alive and has been doing this the whole time!? Serioulsy who wrote that into the script. Would have made more sense for my nan to be behind it all. OK so it starts slow, after about 20 mins of film and all thats happened is clone Alice living a life with her husband and deaf daughter (Whats that about? What impact on the film was this meant to provide?)I was starting to wonder if this film was ever going to get going. In answer to that no. I waited for the good parts to start, and it did..... at the very end of the film.... way to drag this series out some more. 90 mins of Alice just fighting her way out of one place. One place! Only to be injected with the T virus again!? Why take it a way from her then give it her back later, should have just written the 4th film off!

395,servo24810,Dreadful,1,24 September 2012,"I can't believe I wasted the money to see this in the theater. Thank God I didn't pay for 3D. I don't even know where to start, except that the only redeemable aspect is you finally get Leon, Barry, and Ada in the film series.The CGI was like a steak from a all-you-can-eat-buffet way overdone! Perhaps it was because it was intended to be shot for 3D and standard format was forced to suffer. For all of the computer work they had, they just should have done another animated film.All of the characters seemed like they were trying to out act each other. Seriously, their dialog didn't flow well, and felt like amateur hour. I have seen better high school renditions of ""guys and dolls"" or even ""death of a salesman"".The film was reminiscent of the last 2 Pirates of the Caribbean with the multiple story lines running parallel throughout the movie. The fight scenes were also completely ridiculous. Seriously, is Rain the new Vorhese? She seriously dies in the first movie, comes back here, dies once as a ""civilian clone"" and the final fight scene is almost impossible to kill again. She injects herself with the ""las plagas"" to gain super-strength, gets filled with lead by Leon and Luther, the bullets are ejected from her finger tips, and then they both proceed to go hand-to-hand with her. If you don't killer her by lead poisoning, a little slap fighting probably wont cut it.I won't even get into the gun fighting. Yes its fiction, but even here a dual .50 cal fired at a pimped out Cadillac with do more than chip the paint job. Everyone in the car would be meat jelly in 10 seconds. All Alice says to the boys in the back is basically ""you wanna shoot back?"" Are you kidding??!?!?! Are they really trying to kill the franchise? I mean I would ""almost"" rather pay the same money watch ""Batman and Robin"" again! At least we could hear Arnold say the corny freeze puns again instead of this catastrophe. It was like they took the last 3 games, put them in a blender, took a dump in it, and hit puree.Don't waste the money in the theater, and if you see it in 3D serves you right you got robbed.

396,drunken_piratez,I know it has it's flaws.. But i had an AMAZING and AWESOME time nonetheless!!,8,17 September 2012,"I have seen and heard many negative reviews about the latest installment of the Resident Evil series, and that Paul W.S. Anderson has ruined the Resident Evil franchise but I really have to disagree with all these critics.Sure, the movie does have it's flaws, especially plot wise, dialogue wise etc. But I still found it to be an awesome action movie with dazzling 3-D effects, cool and exciting fight sequences and enough action to keep your heart pumping non-stop!The opening sequence for this movie was just EPIC, especially with the music composed by Tomandandy. Being able to see the action unfold in reverse and in slow motion was just the coolest thing ever. It also introduces us to the Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil 5 game with her mind-controlling scarab in action for the first time, with her machine guns blazing. Another thing i really loved was how Alice used her coins as ammunition for the last time against one of the umbrella helicopters. The story of how they were all racing against time to escape from the Umbrella facility reminded me of the first movie and also in some way the games, where you have a certain time limit to escape before the building you are in explodes.Another thing i loved about the movie was the introduction of characters Ada Wong, Leon S. Kennedy and Barry Burton. I believe that Li BingBing played the role of Ada Wong rather well. Like the games, there are moments where she will exude a certain confidence, and appear tough, while at times, she would appear vulnerable, like when she gets caught.Johann Urb also portrayed Leon well, though i would definitely hope to see him in more action, and with more dialogue (smarter ones).Kevin Durand was an interesting take on the character Barry in my opinion. In the games, I would think of Barry as a more grumpy, rugged and older man. Whereas here you get a younger and more humorous Barry, which i thought was alright. The final battle on the ice boasts some of the most creative and amazing fight sequences, (in amazing 3-D). This fight is also the first time where i find myself actually fearing for Alice's life (watch it and you know why) and I really enjoyed seeing her in this vulnerable state. She is human after all.One major flaw in this movie was the dialogue. Although i do appreciate the occasional cheesy one liners, I do think there was way too many cheesy lines here. Also, i find that some of the dialogue makes it seem like the characters weren't really conversing, but rather making statements. Especially the one where Alice was talking to Leon before she heads off to rescue *someone*. Another flaw of this movie was the discreet introduction of the Las Plagas parasite. Fans of the Resident Evil franchise would know of the parasite from the 4th game, but they should have at least dedicated some time in the movie to introduce the parasite, and explain it's origins. Other than these little flaws, I still found the film enjoyable. I have watched it three times already and each time i left the cinema i find myself being mind blown by it.I will definitely look forward to the next Resident Evil movie, which i am sure will happen. Be sure to catch this movie in IMAX 3-D! Worth every penny.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I really hope that someday someone remakes this series and sticks to the story of the game. It would be sooooo much better.This movie is literally Alice running around for no reason shooting people.

If your true genuine lover of zombies this movie is for you! Non- fans may enjoy it because of the GREAT ACTION!I have followed the movies since the first back in 2002 and fell in love right away. Movie picks up right after the ""Afterlife."" Alice sums up all the movies in the beginning; however,a lot is left out from what she shares in the beginning. This movie brings a lot in from the games and with that it gives you a game kind of feel during the movie. Alice and her team have to complete stages and kill bosses. None stop fun and action from start to finish. You have almost time to think during the movie; I sat through the credits processing ""What just happened"" in the last 1hr & 1/2? I encourage you to give RE 5 a chance and help yourself by not listening to all the RE Film criticizers and the critics. It makes me wonder if they even watched the movies? I was hoping it was a bit longer of a movie and the whole thing with A. Wesker? Overall 8/10. These movies are promising and I would say their is a bright future ahead for the RE Film Series!!!",Resident Evil - Retribution
399,zen11195,"Contains spoilers, disappointing",2,19 September 2012,"So what is this film about? At the end of the last film we see Alice on top of an oil tanker with a bunch of freed Umbrella experimental victims. Film opens, they all die, Alice gets captured, taken to an underground facility, which the rest of the film is about her escaping from. Sound familiar? She gets help along the way, strangely from the guy she blew up at the end of the previous film. So why go and see this film? Well for me, I needed to know how the series is going to progress. With any luck the next film will be the last, Oh and Alice gets her powers back in the last 30 seconds of the film to turn her back into the ultimate weapon to save the human race. I was hoping for resolution, or a culmination to the series with this film, not a stringing and milking of the fan base.

I liked the Reverse- Prequel-Intro and the time in the ""matrix"" with shocking moments and emotions and a little humor but then this movie turned into a scene to scene shooting range with god-mode weapons and totally shitty Nazi-zombies and old beasts from part 2 and 4. thats all. nothing more to say to this piece of crap. this series developed just like saw. the first one interesting with good ideas. the second one the same but in a bigger area. then the third...

401,stacey-payne90,Could have been better!,5,20 September 2012,"To be honest I'm not a fan of these films, I love the games just not the live action movie's.The actors are great, don't get me wrong, they all portrayed the original RE live action film characters well as the other movie's, as well as the RE game characters. To be honest I only wanted to see this film due to the fact Leon was finally in it! I needed to make sure they portrayed him well and I've got to say... I was disappointed and it's not because of Johann Urb he played Leon fantastically they picked the right guy to play him, plus he's hot!! But Leon wasn't witty! That's the best thing about Leon he's quick witted, but he was just boring and didn't really have that many lines... was basically a bit part like Barry who didn't say much either and was way too tough than I remember him being in RE.The story line's for these films are just awful! The red queen i just don't understand, why is she being portrayed as a child, i know its mentioned in the first film but can't remember, they should at least stick to the games scenario. There was way too much action in this film also, it was just action, after action, after action, after action there was hardly a break in between the action sequences, i was hoping for something more dark and for a big arse creature that wasn't so easy to take out! oh and as for the Las Plagas that Rain injected into herself and Leon and the other guy couldn't kick her arse... Leon would have know how to have killed her, the las plagas virus isn't unbeatable... just so disappointed and they've left it open for another one... The only way i'll see this one is if Leon is in it again :D LOL",Resident Evil - Retribution
402,Gierlappen,Potential gave away,7,23 September 2012,Well this is my first Commentary on a Movie. I think i won't tell something important to reveal parts of the Story. Just read and see.The first Thought i got after i've seen this Movie was why no one tests this Film and maybe criticizes the weak Parts of it. I love Resident Evil from little Boy on till now where Movies of my favorite Game took over. A really intelligent Introduction with Reversing the Storyline for a perfect reconciliation to the upcoming Story was a real Word to start with. There are nice shocking Effects in the following so that my Mouth couldn't stop smiling. The never ending Action-Scenes are the Stuff what makes this Movie alive. You and of course the actors cant get rid of it.:-)The Story in general is not bad but could be better. Innovating Ideas in between- but not superior new. In between there are many unnecessary Dialogs which pull the Rating of this Movie down like an anchor. Also gratuitous is the Voice but more the Video Animation of the Red Queen through the whole Film. Finally i'd say this is not the worst Resident Evil but unfortunately I think the 5th Part had to reveal on the Cinemas to be shown. Who likes the Second Part will also like this One. Some nice 3D Effects top off the cinema experience so if you like Resident Evil just watch this One.,Resident Evil - Retribution

Well that one has nothing to do with the movie, its the ending scene!When I started to watch the Resident Evil movies, i quickly realized, they have not much in common with the games! So you must not try to compare them!This movie invested a lot in very bad 3d effects that desperately try to cover up the fact that plot and logic went overboard at the very first scene and cruelly drowned!The story makes absolutely no sense, it completely ignores what happened in the previous movies and the only highlights were some semi nude pictures of Milla Jovovich and well thats it!The whole plot of this movie is normally covered in the first 30 minutes of any other movie and raises the suspicion that they just want to milk the cow dry!",Resident Evil - Retribution
404,aristolholy,"total crap, should end at Resident Evil: Afterlife",2,24 September 2012,"real crap, that what i can say about this film. i think this film is better ended at Resident Evil: Afterlife when the boss was dead but now they make the sequel with another ""never ending story"" with a total crap at its end. at the end of Resident Evil: Retribution, when i see the castle that was ""the last stronghold of humanity"", its make me wonder: whoa, is this film want to make sequel of Lord Of The Ring or the sequel of Resident Evil? with all that dragon zombie that flying around the castle versus helicopter and that giant+zombie versus flame thrower, so now the story was a castle defense against zombie? that looks like a mix of modern firepower + lord of the ring for me",Resident Evil - Retribution

These movies veered TOTALLY off course, and shouldn't even be considered part of the Resident Evil movie selection. Not to mention, VERY short. Just when you think it's about to begin, it ends. I'm legitimately mad at myself for paying to see this. I keep ""hoping"" that maybe the writers will come out will a truly well-put-together movie, or even just better than the last, but have severely failed my expectations for the last handful of movies. If they do plan on coming out with yet another Resident Evil, which is definitely suggested by the total LACK of movie, I, for one, will not be donating my money again.",Resident Evil - Retribution
406,vincent_peter_buckley,"Same Old, Same old",3,28 September 2012,"Resident Evil, the video game to movie franchise that's outlasted the rest. First there was Resident Evil and then we have had Apocalypse, Extinction, Afterlife and now Retribution.Now this time around the film revolves around Alice, just like all the others. Alice is caught by Umbrella, the big nasty corporation, just like all the other films. This time she has to fight her away out against a load of zombie monsters and clones or drones from a compound in Russia. Here she meets some familiar faces along the way and guns and explosions splatter brains around the place.Now quite frankly I like zombie films but also quite frankly this franchise has offered very little since the first movie. This film brings back some old characters in a clear way to encourage somebody to give it the green light and sanction a budget of $65 million. This does at least give the story a bit of a twist but it's pretty much the same old drivel and same old ideas. The only character I wanted to see back was Sienna Guillory's and only because she is frankly blooming gorgeous.If you watched the last rotter in this franchise line you will remember it ended all set up for a sequel. This was kind of annoying but it sort of tied a rubbish plot line up in the hope for something better next time along. Well that hasn't happened and to make matters worse this film does exactly the same, its left all set for another sequel and judging by the early box office it will surely get made.There's really nothing new and there's far too much of the stupid throw something scenes so it misses the baddie and hurtles towards the camera, all done to justify this movies 3D status. It's boring, we've seen that before and we are not impressed. Ill give it some credit though, the monster zombies look better than they have done so far. The opening sequence is also noteworthy, but then half repeats itself to fill time, but at least it was mildly imaginative.This franchise could easily be rebooted for the money they spend on it and they would be better for it. Anderson just loves directing his wife in these movies; I just don't like watching them any more. Frankly this movie sums up all that's bad about some Hollywood films. Its mindless drivel because it's easy to sell that ultimately ends in the audience being short changed. Worse of all to short change us some more by setting up yet another sequel while we are watching this one, not for the first time either.If you like RE you may like this, but you will have seen it all before. It's just brain numbing shooting scenes where the baddie can't shoot straight but all the goodies can. Its predictable nonsense of the most boring kind. It's really quite insulting.",Resident Evil - Retribution
407,TerraSave,Slick and sick,10,29 September 2012,"Let me start by saying that these films should not be screened for critics. Of course they will complain! Theses films are made for the fans, not the critics. Yes the plot is a bit thin but escaping from an Umbrella Lab has Resident Evil written all over it. Yes the characters have maybe two lines each but this is a crazy-action-zombie movie, the emphasis is on the crazy action not the dialogue! Notice how no one mentions the 3D effect. The 3D is consistently phenomenal, the best available. The recap at the start of the film was above the heads of the viewers in front of me. If you disagree, go and watch it again in a better cinema with better equipment. Further, there was hardly a second of blur. Everything was sharp, crisp and vibrant even during the crazy action. The choreography was incredible. Milla Jovovich spinning about perfectly with her chain and gun was more of a dance than a fight. A bad ass dance though! How can anyone not like this? I'm trying to think of something better in life than Sienna Guillory in her ""battle suit"", flipping about shooting things. There's nothing better! Maybe some reviewers would rather see Christian Bale in skin tight black leather and sure, Dark Knight Rises is the superior film but Retribution is everything a fan could ask for and some people just need to sort out their expectations. We are not trying to win an Oscar here, we just want zombie brains splattered into our faces in glorious 3D. 10/10? Why not.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Just when I was sure that the plots to these horrible movies couldn't get any more senseless and convoluted; just when I thought that they couldn't crap on the Resident Evil lore and the characters there in more than they already have; they pump out this steaming pile of garbage. The plot (if you can call it that) makes zero sense. The writers of these films have dropped their compass in the woods and are hopelessly lost.What was wrong with the original video game plot?. RE (the games) 1, 2, and 3's stories were all 10 times better than any of the movies Paul Anderson has made. For the love of all things sacred we need to boycot these films.

I just have two things to say about this movie: #1 being that I believe that the franchise is heading in a new direction and that RE5 was a starting point for this new direction the franchise has chosen e.g. Albert Wesker is now the President of what's left of the U.S. and he's teamed up with Alice for one final showdown for RR 6. Pretty cool twist if you ask me. #2 I believe that this movie, just like it's predecessor RE4 helps keep the 3D experience going strong. I mean let's face it, not many 3D movies utilize the technology to it's fullest potential and I believe that this movie helps develop the 3D experience. that being said, this movie delivers what you would expect.

It has a mix of horror, great action sequence and graphics, the just apt acting by the actors as per the script , a bit of romance and above all good visual effects. What else is required in a movie which a person watch to spend the weekend with friends?Agreed the movie doesn't makes much sense but nowadays very few movies make sense, Resident Evil Retribution is a kind of movie which is entertaining right from the time when the movie starts till the credits roll on the screen.Just Awesome movie to pass time and indeed it is worth the money spent on ticket, I am just waiting for the finale of this series.

It is just a stupid idea to take her back, the character didn't have important value, she was not even in the game! Have Paul W.S Anderson and the team (crew, actors) played the game? I thought the game was far better than this stupid movie.Evil goes global. What global? Underground facility? It is stupid advertisement..And please, make a better trailer, not a cheap twisted drama without purpose trailer.This movie is totally awful, Paul W.S Anderson make his name looks like 'Uwe Boll'",Resident Evil - Retribution

Still 10 years later i'm complaining about how they royally messed up an attempt to reinvent the series and now realising that, they try to add main characters from the game into totally different and random scenarios while all being led by this same pointless failure of a character (Alice) who they clearly have gone way to far with to actually get rid of! Rant over :)*Taken a breath* All dialogue from all characters must have easily been fit onto one sheet of A4 paper and felt like i was watching one huge action scene.Such a shame that he would disrespect the characters that Capcom have built and we as an audience have grown to love and adore, the best thing for this whole franchise is to start over and use the characters as they should be used (Definitely not the way they have in this film and whole series) and give us the amazing live action movie of the hugely popular game franchise that we expected long ago.",Resident Evil - Retribution

But about quarter way through the film, the plot just seems to be unfollowable, broken up by tons of pointless fight scenes (which utilise the 3D function, which in my opinion is annoying in any film, anyway) and the introduction fan-girls/boys' wet dreams in the shape of memorable characters from the game's franchise.Although it was nice to see these characters from the game, it shows you how much of a profit orientated film this really was. This is reflected in the poorly written script and the lack of actual enjoyable 'science fiction horror' style moments which really let the film, and the series down, in my opinion.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I am a fun of the games I have played Resident Evil 1,2,3,4 and a bit of the 5, My favorite game is Resident Evil 1, a truly lovely horror game, Resident Evil 2,3 are OK, then I has just become a shooter game with less horror. Same with this sequels, Well comparing this to other Resident Evil movies, the first resident Evil was OK, not bad, in the second one it was OK, in the 3rd one it was getting bad, the 4rd one not a really good movie, and this one, is also not a really good movie.The action parts are really bad. Eda Wong is such a weak girl in this movie, and Resident Evil Damnation or even within the game, (cutscenes) she is really strong and she never lets her guard down so easily. If you look at the game and the live action films, there are a lot of gaps.A lot of the scenes are simple pathetic, they are making a complete ridicule of the game.If you are a fan of Resident Evil, watch Resident Evil Degeneration, Resident Evil Dammation or, Resident Evil 4d executer. All of the are CGI films. To summarize if you are a fun of the game don't watch the movie.",Resident Evil - Retribution
415,jahnwa,Resident Evil: Abomination,2,12 October 2012,"Now I realize that the Resident Evil movies aren't Oscar worthy, but they are entertaining, and I was highly anticipating the new movie, being an RE fan. I ignored previous reviews that had slammed the movie because RE movies usually get a fair amount of hate. This was my first mistake. My second was when I walked into the theater the day after it premiered and there were 5 other people. I should have walked out and demanded a refund, but I did not, this was mistake number two. I thus had to sit through what is possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Mostly because of plot holes.Anyone who has seen the movies knows that Paul W.S. Anderson isn't always the most consistent, but this movie took it to an extreme. It's like it didn't care that it was stepping all over the previous movies. I could go on and on listing them, but I'll just name a few of the bigger ones: SPOILER ALERTS:Michelle Rodriguez' character Rain injects herself with a Las Plagas virus and becomes invincible...unlike the Las Plagas soldiers that Leon and Luther KILLED in the Russia dome - Giving Alice back her powers (since Paul W.S. can't make up his mind) -No explanation of what happened to the characters from the last film -Wesker is now a good guy and is leading a band of survivors in Washington D.C. who SOMEHOW had the time/resources to build a wall around the White House, oh and this band of survivors was there all along when Alice scoured the world for survivors apparently -The Red Queen system from the first movie (that got fried) is determined to exterminate humans (even though it's job was to contain the virus)There's countless others, but overall, so many, that I got the impression that no one cared about this movie, and this is Paul W.S.' lazy money machine that will never stop. So I give it 2 stars (Because at least the actors seemed to half give a crap...sometimes)",Resident Evil - Retribution

But I really liked the resident evil 1 and the sequences 2,3 and 4. This movie also doesn't have the essence of Resident evil, the suspense, the thrilling things that happened in the other movies. I hope next sequence they put another director with better vision of the storyline since Resident evil 1. In order to succeed for the 6th sequence, I would say that the director should watch the 4 first Resident Evil movies before doing a lousy movie like Resident Evil 5.",Resident Evil - Retribution
417,iateyourham,Easily the worst RE yet.,1,17 October 2012,The movie starts off with a promising beautiful shot of Milla floating surrealistically in the water. You start wondering what happened and you're eager for the story unfold and find out more. But then a badly done cgi opening sequence in reverse starts unfolding and all the mystery and suspense is just ruined. This movie is for people who have no appreciation for suspense being built up. The action just vomits on the screen endlessly without thought or build up. And the whole thing is made worse by the realization that all of what you are seeing is a hologram illusion created by the Red Queen AI trying to kill all humans. It's ridiculous because there is no explanation why the red queen couldn't just endlessly create Executioners. The fight with the licker is over in a pathetic 2 seconds. The old chemistry with rodriguez is completely missing. The RE franchise has been going downhill but this movie took it off a cliff and nosedived it.,Resident Evil - Retribution

The fight scenes lacks of what i expected, specially the highly anticipated Alice-Jill brawl. I was all like ""OMFG that was it? done already??"". Im happy because Anderson changed or added nothing cause it is based on the video-game. The costumes, the Plagas, the bosses. All smoothly done. Of course there were flaws, all movies have :)Overall, its worth the money and the time.

The first 2 movies from the series were really good and I liked them, but this one is just weak... Every cheap scenario from old action movies were in here, 3/2 human soldiers against an army of undead zombies and they still survive. Cheap stunts which everybody already knows, a lot of unrealistic things (even for a movie of this type); eg. the time between a bad guy shooting a gun and the bullets hitting the place where the hero staid was enough for the hero to grab a gun and shoot a big hole in the floor so she can take cover (and the distance was only a few meters). If they planed to make a parody out of the original series, they definitely succeeded.All and all, I feel sorry for Milla Jovovich, since I really like her as an actress.",Resident Evil - Retribution
420,d_scl,"Bottom line: If you're in for action, this movie definitely has it.",7,29 November 2012,"film flam film critic (dot) b log spot (dot) caResident Evil Retribution The fifth installment in the Resident Evil series is everything it should be: brash, loud, and in your face. If you loved the previous four tomes of this apparently unending tale, you're definitely in for a treat. My only complaint is that it doesn't really add anything meaningful to the series plot-wise, except to say that, yes, Alice was captured again, and, yes, she escaped again against all odds. It's also full of the same old wooden dialog as the last couple of films, and even stiffer delivery (it's honestly as if the director used the first cut where the lines were intelligible), but I doubt you're even reading this review if you're looking for serious drama.The events take place directly after the last movie, where Alice, a zombie-human DNA hybrid, has her mutations reversed by the leader of the Umbrella forces, the evil villain (and super-Zombie) Victor Wesgar. That would lead one to suspect that the Umbrella base where she wakes up is run by him... wrong! He has apparently dissociated himself from Umbrella, which is now being run by 'Red Queen', the same Artificial Intelligence that had attempted to kill Alice in the first movie.A temporary security breach allows Alice to escape her captor, Jill, an old friend of hers under the control of the ubiquitous Red Queen, and make it outside the facility to... downtown Tokyo (but that facility has been blown up already, as we know from a previous RE movie. I honestly can't even remember which one since they sort of all meld together).We then find out that she must navigate through an underwater complex designed by Umbrella to demonstrate the effects of the T-virus in Tokyo, New York, and Moscow, to show potential buyers of the T-virus how effective it could be in their enemies' capital cities (that's right, you would never buy a virus unless you actually saw it kill an entire city of clones that looked like your enemies). This at least makes for interesting changes in scenery. She has help from some old friends (Luther and his gang) fighting their way to her from the surface, as well as outside support from Victor Wesgar, her mortal enemy. I unfortunately made the error of leaving my brain on for the duration of this film. Big mistake. This left me wondering... Where does Umbrella get the resources to keep running real-life simulations replete with thousands of clones and zombies? Did the rescuers absolutely need to risk blowing themselves up by planting a giant time-bomb on the base's doorstep? If two huge zombies were between you and a tanker full of gasoline, wouldn't igniting the gasoline blow them onto you, and not in the opposite direction? Why do the clones need to be dry-cleaned? I wonder when that character that was vaporized at the center of a mushroom cloud is going to re-appear? Why didn't Alice and company commandeer a submarine? How do you finish off a 3-tonne super-mutant? Answer: Drive a Bentley down a bank of escalators!Now, I'm probably being mean. So, I'll give the writers a little credit. The movie also probes one deep question. If a clone was made of you, would it be able to communicate with you telepathically through your dreams?Bottom line: If you're in for action, this movie definitely has it.",Resident Evil - Retribution

I would almost consider it ""b"" movie, but it would be an insult to some talented artists with no funds. Resident evil movies have come to the point where its pointless to go on with the same team. Kill it. Sell the franchise. I am a little worn out with the ideas of reboots and remakes, but this is plain dull and soulless. The movie is filled with deja-vu and slow-mo sorta action scenes.

Anyway the first time I saw 3D was Resident Evil Afterlife on a cinema in Norway. Pretty good one actually and that was still when 3D were pretty fresh. What could be done better? Why 9 of 10 not 10 of 10 possible. I tell you my opinion. I like how these movie series takes an own turn apart from the original concept by Capcom, but the action is being too much focus and story gets lost. Not just that. Characters like Leon, Ada, Jill and many other main characters in the game series is getting, as I see it figuratively ''blown'' away by Alice actions and skills. Don't get me wrong the character Alice a is perfection but I think other game characters should have a bit more attention and status in the movies. Dragging Leon S. Kennedy in the movie is awesome but Alice isn't suppose to tell him away. At least the dialog should be a bit different so Alice don't take all attention from him and other ones.

428,charoa,Don't waste your time or be ready for disappointment,3,22 December 2012,"I have enjoyed all of the previous movies, some more than others but this movie was absolutely flabbergastingly horrible! They spent way way too much time on action scenes and there was very little story. I agree with another reviewer that the whole movie felt like an opening scene. I literally checked the time into the movie at one point and it was 1hr 10 min and i thought to myself, well there is still 50 minutes to round this out and give us a story. And then the movie ended....Like another reviewer said, the whole movie could have been condensed to 20 minutes and they could have given us more to the story. It is disgusting that they would drag this out just so they can add another sequel in this franchise. There is little plot, little dialog and really not much mentionable about the movie. I wish i could demand my money back!",Resident Evil - Retribution
429,shin-00,Worst movie i forced myself to watch in a while.,1,26 December 2012,"As most other reviews have mentioned, this movie is total crap.The only good thing about this movie is the eye-candy provided by Li Bingbing playing Ada Wong. I honestly can't believe a professional movie studio approves and funds a piece of crap like this. Resident Evil needs a reboot, with a director (yes, because nobody will convince me this movie actually had a director), a decent plot line that's actually based on the games and WITHOUT MILA. I'm actually too frustrated to keep on going, so that's all i got to say.",Resident Evil - Retribution
430,grim_reaper666-565-529741,Not as bad as many think...perhaps,6,26 December 2012,"Everyone is perfectly capable of reading the summary of the film at the top of the page so I shan't bother with that. *Possible Spoiler*I've heard many people saying that the whole movie takes place in an underground facility and all they're doing is trying to escape. Firstly, I'd like to point out that the first (and best) Resident Evil movie takes place in a smaller underground facility in which they are trying to escape. All of the RE movies can be bashed for one reason or another. The acting is never aces, they're rather cheesy and can sometimes have less zombies than you'd expect from what is essentially the only zombie-film series going on today. That's why I look at them as action movies WITH zombies. They seem better that way. Granted, Retribution was not my favorite, and as many say the Red Queen was ridiculously cheesy and...weird, I think that that was trying to appeal more to the gamers, as it resembled whole-heartedly an old video game moment. Nitpicking at these movies is a useless endeavour because they aren't made to be the greatest films. They are simple works of entertainment. You don't need super deep story lines when the dead walk the earth. The deepest you go is by saying that the movies are a metaphor for large corporations brainwashing us and stripping us of our individuality, and the fighting that ensues.RE 5 is entertaining. If you pay attention to what IS happening in the movie and not what isn't, you'll follow the story perfectly fine, and won't be bothered by, for example the *spolier* explained 'whimsical' changing of character's faction (good to bad) which seemed to throw many people off.I dare anyway to show me any action movie who's purpose is action-packed entertainment to exhibit fantastic acting, non-cheesiness, and a deep storyline.RE Retribution kept me entertained. I'm not picky. I give it a six because unless I leave a theatre wishing I hadn't seen the movie, then the movie was probably fairly good.",Resident Evil - Retribution
431,jipsiking33,worst Resident Evil movie EVER,2,27 December 2012,Let me count the ways this movie SUCKED. I really enjoy zombie movies. Love Walking Dead. Big fan of the earlier Resident Evil movies. This movie was a huge disappointment. The acting was poor. The scenes looked like they were trying to mimic The Matrix. The action scenes were cartoon-like. This movie has ended my desire to ever see another Resident Evil movie come out. Zombies wielding weapons is one thing. Zombies operating vehicles and dressing in coordinating attire is another. The plot was something that appeared to be written on someone's lunch break. I would give this movie just 1 star but I gave it 2 since there was at least some pretty cool large monsters to see occasionally.,Resident Evil - Retribution
432,jul_cod,They really should be ashamed!,1,29 December 2012,"As a devoted RE fan, I watched and enjoyed every other movies they made until this one. I am utterly disappointed by (1) the script (2) the characters (3) the FX effects (4) the crap they did by diluting the sequels so they can squeeze an extra buck.I wish I could understand what happened, I really do. I used to say that what they did with RE was terrific, I watched from 1 to 4 countless amount of times and I still find them great. Good amount of horror, the acting's good, the characters are interesting, the storyline is great ...everything was great! For a couple years, they were on my to-watch list.I think they took their fans for granted : *oh, let's cook a real piece of crap, I bet they'll still be happy and buy the movie* Let's go into details a bit : First : the first 15-20 minutes = What the hell? Everything we took for granted is turned upside-down. As if they wanted to make us believe that what we saw in the previous movies was either in Alice's mind or some cheap TV trick to fool us? I hate when they pull that stunt.Second : They bring back interesting characters like Rain and Luther so they can do what exactly? Luther dies by some punch in the heart? Hell, the guy survived a freaking zombie army so he can die in such a cheap way? Why did they bring him back? I think they brought back good characters and made them CHEAP really CHEAP.And, my favorite but not the least ...Becky ...oh Becky. Why should the public care about her? I mean, let's be honest here, they focused on her WAY TOO MUCH, why?????? It's not like your usual fan were soccer moms. She brings nothing to the story. We watch RE to see zombies, fights and MORE ZOMBIES AND MORE FIGHTS. Please stop trying to make us relate to people we don't care about.Third : The FX effects .. don't get me wrong, I don't mind them at all. But I miss the old bite-them-in-the-neck-or-arm zombie action + they really overused them. The final fight is really an anthem to fx effects ...they really lost me there.",Resident Evil - Retribution
433,kysonfireboy888,A thrill ride that will leave you wanting more!,10,30 December 2012,"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I honestly wasn't expecting much. However, 5 minutes in and I was completely blown away. The choreography is superb, the plot is masterfully crafted, and the character development almost made me cry when anybody died. There are unmatched jump scenes and scares, as well as very heartfelt and tender moments. The performance of all the cast is really quite astonishing. Just when I think Milla Jovovich is at the end of her career, she reboots this saga with a mind blowing performance. Props to director Paul W.S. Anderson for such a gripping plot, and ending it masterfully. I would honestly say the action is comparable to the first Matrix movie. Definitely one of this year's must see, and the best Resident Evil movie yet!",Resident Evil - Retribution
434,leonward,"Another good addition to the series, gets better as we go...",9,31 December 2012,"Now, let me tell you something. Most of the acting is pretty bad. The voice-overs most of the time are second rate.But that doesn't matter. What this movie delivers it provides in spades. Plenty of action, an actual interesting plot (a surprise) and a few twists.Nice to see some old faces, even a few twists there. This is the second movie in the series that actually kept me engaged to the end, same with first movie.If your a fan of the series or the games you will probably like this movie. If your looking for cinematic excellence, you wont find it here.I gave it a solid 9 out of 10 despite it's flaws.",Resident Evil - Retribution

436,aaron2895,An Insult to RE fans,3,26 January 2013,"This film, in my words, is an abomination and should never see the light of day. It is corny, it has bad actors and the movie is plot holes galore. The one that really knacked me off is the part were Leon and Co. are in the Moscow simulation and the Red Queen says ""release Las Plagas undead"". WTF, Las Plagas do not ride bikes and fire guns, I think they mean to say Juavo from RE6. That annoyed me to a huge extent. The characters never reload or take a bullet, bar Luther and Alice, but that was obvious. Jill looks like she is high the whole time. When Rain injects herself with Las Plagas, she does not go all messed up and stuff, she turns into Usain Bolt and hammers everyone as if she was on steroids and the one thing that really annoyed me was the acting. Each and every actor in this film sounded ""bored"" if you know what I mean and it was just a shambles.Cannot believe they are going to make a sixth one, it honestly cant get any worse. No thought was put into this movie, do not watch if you are a hardcore RE fan as you will be bitterly disappointed.Oh BTW, there are spoilers in this review LOL",Resident Evil - Retribution

To me this was a great movie, the script was good,cgi and of course the acting. Mila always comes through and i always love the directors not totally relying on her to carry a movie the other actors were great as well.If you want a crappy love story or some drama which we have enough of yea move on, But if you want an action-packed movie with big explosions blood and some gore with those crazy looking zombie like creatures we all love then by all means sit back and enjoy because this movie delivers.",Resident Evil - Retribution

Honestly just watch the first 3 and forget the rest, especially this one. It is worse then Resident Evil Afterlife. The movie itself started off looking good with action galore, then that is it. The movie has a mediocre story line, at least the original cast were in the movie (most of them). It completely disbands the original story (along side games) and comes up with some ""testing"" facility that they are using to test out new creatures. But in saying that, there were not really that many new zombies. No horror / thriller elements either.

440,wunner-thomas,Retribution. Few mistakes but great simple Action!,9,2 April 2013,"I m sure to understand those, who aren't a fan of simple Action. And OK, its not that easy to follow the storyline, if u don't know the games or have been watching the other parts of Resident Evil. But all others i cant understand, what they r xpecting from the new part.From start on, the action, showed in the movie, was fabulous. Its no difference between this movie or the ones before. If u expect a new changed action to the other parts, then u shouldn't watch this, cause nothing has changed. Zombies running over the world after a virus broke out and umbrella is creation new creatures, after the world is almost being destroyed. So u ll see zombie in different version every part and this one showed up a real well made realisation of the game.I really love the scenery ""copied"" from the game and i think this is the best of the five movies. The hole film took me in his ban from the very first second. Surely the little review wasn't enough to make u understand the hole storyline but, who cares....(only if u don't know the other ones). 90% of this movie are in a well made 3D quality. Surely its possible to make it better(like avatar), but i looked many 3D films before and this is one of the upper league. I just took away one Star cause of some logic mistakes, but if u r a man(or woman) who likes this part of action-,sf-movies or videogames , which don't need a big ""wow"" storyline u will love this movie. Its just simple but very well done realisation of the video game.For addition: The expendables don't have a big story 2 but there are so many people out there, who love this film too.",Resident Evil - Retribution
441,con070396,Resident Evil: Retribution,10,22 April 2013,"Another amazing movie in the Resident Evil franchise. All of the best characters from the previous movies have been reintroduced into the movie, including Rain (Michelle Rodriguez). This movie one of the best, second only to Extinction. Several characters from the Resident Evil games have put into this movie, just like Resident Evil: Apocalypse. Aryana Engineer (Maxine from Orphan) has been introduced as a new character (Becky). This movie follows on from the ending of the last Resident Evil movie, where Alice is aboard the ship Arcadia, and is captured by Umbrella and taken to one of their underground bases, where she is aided by several people to escape. Once again, the Red Queen (Megan Charpentier - Mama) has turned homicidal and attempts to kill them before they can escape.The characterisation within this movie is better than the previous. Becky and Alice build a great relationship together. Overall, I think this was definitely one of the best Resident Evil movies, and I can't wait for number 6!! Hopefully in number 6 we find out what happened to K-Mart and Claire, as they seem to just disappear...I would definitely recommend watching this movie, it's amazing!! :)",Resident Evil - Retribution
442,jesterfogg,Is it a parody or just the biggest bullsh...?,1,8 May 2013,"I don't get it. When Resident Evil started off as a PC game, it was all about a virus spread by Umbrella Corporation that turns Humans into Zombies. A new idea for a zombie shooter and it was great. The first Movie was good, real good zombie action with the mutants already known from the game. The plot was well thought and of course not everyone survives. So far so good. But what they made of RE in the sequels is just hilarious. RE:Afterlife had a bad story and bad recessions were well earned. It was a bad story with ""twists"" that only made the movie even worse. With all this in mind i was hoping for a better fifth part. I was sure the production Team did read all this bad recessions and would try to make up for it in RE:Retribution. But it got even worse! Well if you feel like i did: See for yourself i promise you will be stunned by the incredible stupidity of the plot (can you even call that a plot?!) and the action scenes that make the A-Team look like a documentation. Besides that the shooting is even worse than what the A-Team was doing and they never hit anyone! If you still feel like watching this piece of crap, stop reading here and don't blame me for a ruined evening.Spoiler: Well the ""Story"" takes off where part 4 ended. Alice gets knocked out and wakes up in her bed with a husband and child, when all of a sudden the zombies attack. Then the Intro and she awakes again in a high security cell in an Umbrella Corp facility. So far so bad. Then someone hacks the security system and brings it down so Alice can escape. She gets help from her enemies from previous RE parts and is told that a Team is heading towards her to help her get away, because she has the weapon that may change the world for good again. Well OK, that seems very normal so all of a sudden Alice and her prevoius enemies behave like best friends. The Escape-run is like a bad PC game: Try to finish the Level, proceed to the next and so on. Oh guess what, the Leader of the Umbrella troopers is Jill Valentine and she is controlled by a kind of mechanical scarab clinging to her breast cage. The thing is nothing fits together: The first encounter with Zombies, well they behave like you would expect them to. But on the next Level you have this giant Mutants that even a 100 bullets in the Head can't slow them down. The next Level is a horde of Zombies with guns, jeeps, bazookas and of course on Motorcycles and they keep firing and guess what? they all miss. Then the new unified rescue team and Alice do a little James Bond Style Car chase with, yes the zombies in the jeeps and Motos chasing them. Obviously the Zombies are somehow controlled and act like a regular army! It gets even worse but i will spare you with more. I just can't tell you all the bloopers and inconsistencies because there are far too many. The dialogs - once again: can you even call that a dialog? - are just stupid. The best joke is the end and if you can't stand watching the whole movie jump forward to the final 3 minutes and have a good laugh. Not even the Matrix-Style fighting scenes and beautiful Milla Jovovich can save this movie. RE:Retribution is marked as horror, action, sci-fi movie. I am missing parody because you can't take this movie serious. Is the Author the same that wrote Swamp Thing? Well Swamp Thing is better...",Resident Evil - Retribution
443,slurm-755-967158,"Killing title, gaining money",2,3 August 2013,"Please, no more. It's already too bad, this episode of the franchise. Zombies in the fur-hats with machine guns and RPGs at once makes you think about drugs consumed by writers. And there's more: catch-up with the submarine, clones (go home, Palpatine), accurate product placement at the streets of simulated New York, cutting moments from Metal Gear Solid 3 (battle with Mother) and fighting games, Mortal Kombat (infraview) and Soul Calibur (any fight between two ladies using knives, although Alice acted more like Voldo, if you know what I mean), mini-boss with two lives and a huge weak spot, so obvious, that creators should have paint a target on it, Wesker, Plagas from games and anime, castrated Leon, showing the ability of a pick-up master level 99 in Ada, who, hum, moved like android, death forgettable characters, and Michelle Rodriguez in two images, which do not differ too much in terms of wagering - here she's ours, and here's not. And then she's a clone, but the clones will drown, so nobody cares. And a zerg-rush, classic. I find it hard to imagine what will be at the final episode, but there's sure to be a cameo by Schwartz and Willis, it could't do worse.

444,ryans53,Brains. Brains!,1,31 October 2013,"This script needed them badly. Absolutely nothing about this film's ""story"" is intelligent. There are no story arcs, no plot twists, no interesting insights into the Umbrella corporation, no discernible motives of any of the characters; there isn't even anything ""scary"" or ""horror-like"" in there. It's just minute after minute of vapid stupidity, interspersed with moments of slow motion or reverse motion. Paul Anderson may be getting paid piles of dollars to ""write"" and ""direct"" these monstrosities, but that in no way makes him a professional writer or director.Maybe, Paul--just maybe--everything in the film doesn't have to go 100 miles per hour. Maybe you don't need a million bullets flying, fast glowing cars, hoards of monster targets, and plenty of hard-bodied actors/actresses. Maybe, Paul--just maybe--fans of the Resident Evil series had their fill of this formula after the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stupid installment. Why not, Paul--why not take your foot off the gas a bit and try some real storytelling? Why not use fewer monsters but make them scary or interesting? Why not use characters who aren't invincible and give them fewer weapons? Why not use some of the suspense and horror that made the video game such a hit? Are you aware that players like me were actually AFRAID to play the original game in the dark? It was actually scary--and not because there were millions of monsters and pretty people spraying bullets everywhere--but because there were few bullets and monsters could really kill you.Resident Evil: Retribution, like every previous Resident Evil film, is just a cut-and-paste job throwing outlines of elements of the games into a world nothing like the video game world. Ada's costume is spot-on and the actress looks very much like the Ada in Resident Evil 4 on Gamecube, but her character--that is, her script and acting--is terrible. She's not mysterious; she's not duplicitous; her only purpose seems to be to eventually give Alice her grappling hook gun. Leon's costume includes the coat with the fluffy collar in Resident Evil 4 as well, but again his character doesn't feel anything like the game's. Barry's costume includes the red vest and the magnum, but his personality is one of a gun-toting adolescent. Barry is supposed to be a reserved, tactical, sage-like soldier, not this ""ya-hoo"" bad-ass. In fact, one could say that every character is really the SAME CHARACTER in different outfits. Every single character is automatically devoted to the same cause, with the same invincible attitude, just dressed in different clothes. No one is ever scared of anything; no one ever cares if anyone else dies; no one even questions the fact that they're taking orders from Wesker--the primary villain in the film's universe who supposedly now cares about the human race for reasons Paul never even attempts to explain.Other elements of the game are just ""thrown in"" for no good reason. There's the Las Plagas parasite from Resident Evil 4 which, according to Paul, makes zombies wield guns and drive vehicles while making human clones basically invincible. For the record, the Las Plagas virus in the games was a mind control device that turned a whole town into a kind of cult. Its insertion into the movie furthers the plot in no way whatsoever. It's just ""there"" inexplicably. Furthermore, amidst a huge hoard of Las Plagas infected monsters in the simulated Moscow setting, one of them carries a chainsaw reminiscent again of a Resident Evil 4 monster. Whereas the chainsaw monster in the game was appropriate due to the fact it existed in a village full of pitchfork and knife wielding villagers, the chainsaw makes no sense in the Moscow setting because all the other monsters have machine guns. Paul just ""throws it in"" because, well, he thinks it's ""cool."" Maybe we'll get lucky and some new writer/director will reinvent the series the way the Nolen bros. reinvented the Batman universe after it was destroyed in the late 90s. I encourage anyone reading this to refrain from paying any money to see the next film. The only way to kill crap like this is to starve it of any profitability.",Resident Evil - Retribution
445,strikersdomain-net,Resident Awful,2,23 September 2012,"The film opens with a 10 minute slow motion time waster, to be followed by a 7 minute re-introduction, and 80 minutes of painful action scenes. I kept waiting for a plot, but one never came. Not even 3D could save this movie. I gave it 2 stars because it was 3D. If it was in 2D I would have ranked it at 0. I like action movies, but I really didn't care about the characters. I even wanted the little girl to die, because I knew later on it would just slow them down and try to add emotion to it. They have thousands of clones and they just send 6 people. There's a giant explosion at the feet of the 2 female leads which amazingly only blasts in one direction. The cheesy red queen video cuts made me laugh every time. They ""have"" to go through all these simulated cities (so technically not global) and then later they amazingly find all these shortcuts. I kept screaming ""Why don't they just take the submarines up?!"" in my head, OF COURSE the red queen is going to cut power ""remotely"" LOL. Magically plucking off a robotic parasite didn't occur to Alice earlier? It just comes off with a flick of the hand? Jill gets her memory back immediately? You didn't think about all the infected you released into that water and who knows what other Umbrella experiments?? But in the first movie you didn't want the virus to get out...?! Movie SUCKED!!!

447,Daltoid2009,Have never reviewed a movie... but I felt compelled.,4,18 September 2012,"After seeing this movie and reading other reviews about the film, I feel compelled to write a review myself. I am a big fan of the resident evil genre, video games, and most of the movies. I saw this film the other night, and it's as if I was suckerpunched in the chest by the filmmakers. Now I know, and have accepted the fact that these films have moved far and away from the original resident evil story, and the overall feel for the genre anyways. I have completely dissociated the two franchises in my mind, aside from the theme and the characters they introduce.When I heard this film was being made I was excited to find out they were going to introduce a few new characters, one being Leon S. Kennedy. He has been my favorite character, by far since the installment of Resident Evil 2 and RE 4. In those games, he was the epitome of a zombie/las plagas-killing badass. In this movie, however, I felt that the Directors really did a number on him and did not do his character justice. He first appears on a convoy with some other notable characters, Barry from RE 1, Luther, and some other mercs. The most laughable thing about Leon at this point was his ATTIRE matched EXACTLY to the outfit in RE4, mind you, they are now in Russia where it is freezing cold, Jeans and a pleather jacket w/ some fur on it. I somehow got over it, and pretty much accepted at this point that the filmmakers were going to try and be true to the video games (all of the sudden).Well over the course of the movie, I noticed a mish-mash of RE 4 and RE 5 references. The introduction of Ada Wong, who is wearing the EXACT same outfit as the one in RE4. The Las plagas virus, which does one of two things, makes you invincible, or allows you to be a zombie that can wield a weapon (both staying true to the video game, but being absolutely ridiculous and exaggerated). The random chainsaw guy in the Moscow environment. The awkward ""relationship"" between Leon and Ada (also exaggerated). And randomly finding grenades in a sack of goo left by the Big Licker(?).Overall, I felt that everything was thrown together with the hope of extending the story of Alice, and giving us a thrill ride on the way. I just couldn't push myself to choke down the terrible dialogue, the cut scenes from environment to environment during crucial action sequences, the sudden cure for a shattered sternum using an IV of what looked like saline solution. Leon's super-human ability to resist the pain of a shattered arm. The ability by everyone in the surviving party to happily cope with the loss of fellow comrades(although they might be used to it by now). The indestructible elevator. The infinite bullet cheat (lucky, no RE ever had that).Hopefully, in the next installment, and the 10 more that will come after that, they choose to leave out video games elements because not only does it just put salt in the wound for Resident Evil fans, it makes for a sloppy story and a poor excuse for a movie.",Resident Evil - Retribution
448,kragnorak,Oddest of the series?,7,15 September 2012,"This review is being written for a very specific purpose. Resident Evil: Retribution actually surprised me! After all, everybody knows what to expect from these movies at this point. The tone shifts from film to film, often the first few minutes of each film destroys the setup from the previous film and then forges onward in a new direction, the acting is generic, the action is stylish and perfectly choreographed to fit the music, etc.But Retribution feels different. In a way, it seems to be created to be a ""greatest hits"" merger of the previous films. The video game atmosphere of the first film returns but at this point Alice, Paul WS Anderson and the audience are much further down the rabbit hole, and in gorgeous 3D, no less. The word of the day is ""trippy"".The movie begins with the first of many cinematic ballets summing up the end of the last film and then proceeds to what feels like three separate beginnings: a longer recap than we are used to, a scene that feels like a dream sequence, and a self-referential beginning that borrows from the best of the previous films. RE5 feels the most like a video game out of this series and it starts here with a labored outline of the quests and perils to come. The end results is that the first 20 minutes of the movie start to feel like the cut scenes of a video game rather than good storytelling: start disoriented, loot the environment for clothes and equipment, get quest, get map, join party, etc.The ""quest-giver"" approach backfires on Anderson, because the set design in this film is absolutely fantastic, and there are an appropriate set of environments and challenges that the characters have to move through in a set time limit (adding to the video game feel). I would have liked to add 'surprises' but there are almost none, because the characters are too well briefed, and so are we as the audience. I realize that it is logical to outline mission parameters in detail, but it does not make for great or suspenseful storytelling, and so Anderson clumsily avoids as many 'WOW moments' as possible which in turn mutes any sense of horror the characters should feel.The final surprising part of RE:5 is just how bad the dialog is. Child actors put the adults to shame (except Milla), and you can drive a truck through the Shatneresque pauses in the stilted delivery of most characters. I have fond memories of the original Playstation 1 Capcom game for their primitive live-action cutscenes and abysmal acting, but that is not something we need to see recreated on the big screen in the year 2012! The stilted delivery was forgivable in some characters because at least we could rationalize that they were mind-controlled, but really it is a blessing that there is very little speaking and so many many action sequences.Because after the first 20 minutes or so, RE5 finally kicks into high gear and refuses to downshift. The director milks every opportunity for slow-motion possible, and we are glad of it because each movement looks fantastic. The deadly ballet feel is present throughout the whole film, and is set to what is probably the best score of the 5 Resident Evil movies. The electronica pulses the action along, and an orchestral touch is not overt until the end where it exists to make each punch, bullet, and raised eyebrow feel epic. For all the movie's flaws, the over-the-top unapologetic action is what we're there to see and Retribution continued to improve in that department. Here's hoping that the next movie capitalizes on Anderson's strengths and turns out to be the orgy of violence that is promised and doesn't try so hard to pretend to have a plot or provide exposition.P.S.: I have tried to avoid spoilers and instead reference only those characters and events that you might expect if you've seen the other movies. But if you haven't see Retribution yet, here is a fun drinking game you might try: quaff each time you see something that is overtly inspired by or is just plain a rip-off of ""Aliens""!",Resident Evil - Retribution
449,paulandersonpuss,These movies make money... that's all that matters.,1,25 November 2016,"Why is there no zero in the options? If I could give it -10 I would.I don't have to say anything negative about this movie because others have done it.I would like to say something about the upcoming sequel resident evil the final chapter.That movie is going to suck big time, just like the other ones of this franchise.You might ask, ""It hasn't come out yet so how can you tell?""The answer is, judging from previous movies namely afterlife and retribution, you can just see W S Anderson doesn't give a s..t about storytelling. This franchise is Anderson's attempt to keep his wife, Jovobitch, employed.In an interview many years ago, Jovobitch said with a smug face, ""We make these movies to make money.""The question is, are you going to keep letting Anderson and his wife serve moviegoers this crappy franchise and get your money?Enough said.",Resident Evil - Retribution
450,cocobos,Impressive visuals and choreography.,10,21 September 2012,"It's been a long time since I last saw movies with such a beautiful cinematic and choreography.I just don't understand why people says the story isn't connected or confusing. For me, as I watched all the previous RE before going to cinema and got blown a way of the awesomeness 3D effects (yes, this movie should be viewed in 3D) and the choreography. Looks so connected and the camera angles are well placed. The story also provide the information and view on the whole map which makes you know and well understand on what's going on. Loves the 3D effects.",Resident Evil - Retribution
451,KingLowman,One of the worst movies I've ever seen!,1,14 September 2012,"Wow. I have seen a lot of bad movies but this one really takes it to a new level of awful. I'm shocked that someone managed to convince people to spend money making this crap.I have seen all of these movies at the cinema and every time, with the exception of the third film, I wish I'd stayed home. My fondness for the games seems to cloud my judgement. I'm an idiot.I won't waste my time discussing the bad points of the plot because this film barley has a plot at all.I will say: I laughed at how the actors held and fired the guns in this movie, especially Jill Valentine. She looked like a child pretending to be a cowboy.I laughed at how many old characters they brought back only to kill them off within a few minutes of appearing.I cringed at the same piece of 'dramatic'music played at every opportunity in the movie.I cringed at the level of acting. The guy who played Leon was a joke.As I said, I've seen a lot of bad movies, but I've never wanted to actually leave without seeing the endings. For this movie I stayed only because my friend treated me to the tickets and leaving them there alone would have been rude.This film was awful. If you can see it for free, do so, just to see how terrible it is. If someone actually attempts to make you pay to see it, punch them! Very hard! In the face!",Resident Evil - Retribution
452,stenz28,My wife even liked this one! (3D review),8,23 September 2012,"First: I'm trying to keep any spoilers out, but I've marked it anyway, just in case!Second: The RE movies and the games are completely different animals! Trying to compare them is like comparing apples to elephants. Why do the game lovers/movie haters always ask where the ""Alice"" character came from because she's not in the games. Well, let me tell you. The reason there's an ""Alice"" in the movies is that she is YOUR avatar that YOU would be playing if this were a game. That's why she isn't in the games. How do you recreate the playable character from a game for every person who played the game? You'll invariably have the: ""She doesn't act/look/smell/feel the way she did when I played her in the game."" Plus, in games your avatar moves the story along by having a lot of exploration and fighting and running away, where movies have to do that for you.Anyway, I liked this movie. I made sure that I never watched more that 30 seconds of previews because now a days I can figure out an entire move in the 2 minute preview and I hate that! Just tease me and let it go, will you?I went in expecting an action movie with no real plot except to move Alice's character along, and I was right. The action is good; the plot is minimal; the acting is so-so; the 3D is very good, and I liked it. I would rate it below RE-1 and RE-2 (mostly because of Jill Valentine); above RE-3; and even with RE-4 (also seen in 3D).A little way into the movie I looked and my wife and said: ""This is like a video game."" She just smiled as she hates most video games. But really, it has the: ""You must go through these areas to reach your goal"" missions. I liked seeing the old characters brought back and then twisted to be good/bad. I didn't mind that some characters were left out. Bringing in Leon was nice and seeing Ada Wong in the red dress was, well, odd! :)OK, the Wesker character is just too much! I don't know why they have him acting like that, but he just rubs me the wrong way. And the ending? is a little weak, like Anderson ran out of ideas and just threw an ending in there. Or maybe he filmed something else and had to put in a Hollywood ending instead.After the movie, my wife said: ""I really liked it."" From her that is like giving something a 10 out of 10! Especially for an action move. A Sci-Fi action movie. A game-based movie! I can't give it a 10, but it is for me a definite 8! Maybe I'm just happy after seeing that horrible John Carter piece of garbage?",Resident Evil - Retribution
