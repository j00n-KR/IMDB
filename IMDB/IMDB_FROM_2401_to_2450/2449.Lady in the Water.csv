0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not Shyamalan's worst, but his strangest...",3,11 January 2012,"Just for the record, I am not a Shyamalan detractor, nor am I a fan. I loved The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, and there were good things about Signs and The Village, even if the films were deeply flawed. It's just that to me after The Village, the rest of Shyamalan's resume ranged to strange to dire. Whether I loved his first couple of films and didn't care/hate the rest has nothing to do with racism, contrary to some of the threads I've come across on his message board.It's just that it is sad that such a promising director, who showed that he could tell a story effectively had either become sloppy or had tried to do many things at once and consequently the respective film buckled(which was the case with The Village). Lady in the Water is not Shyamalan's worst, for me that's The Happening with The Last Airbender not far off, but having seen all his films I do think it is his strangest.Lady in the Water does have its good things though. The score is suitably haunting, Paul Giamatti is a wonderful actor and while deserving of a stronger character and less contrived script he does give his all into the performance and it shows. But the best thing about Lady in the Water was the beautifully done animated prologue.However, that is all the praise I can give. The rest of the acting is either unimpressive or awful. Bryce Dallas Howard was fantastic in The Village and she is good as an actress, but while like Giamatti she tries her best her character is nowhere near as poignant or as interesting as that of hers in The Village. Jeffrey Wright and Bob Babalan are wasted, and Shyamalan himself makes an appearance that feels very thrown in and at the end of the day is just a form of annoyance.Scripting-wise Lady in the Water all feels very contrived and overly-silly, the pacing becomes increasingly sluggish in the second half which further suffers from trying to do too much and the characters consist of either stereotypes(the film critic tenant, the kid who could decipher codes from cereal packets and the philosopher of future importance) or fantasy ""mythological"" clichés with grass-haired werewolves for scrunts and twig monkeys for the tarturic that have no depth to them. The scenery and lighting are okay if not exactly dynamic but the camera angles look slip-shod and lazy, with over-use of half-face shots and focusing on nothing.But it is the story that sinks Lady in the Water. The premise was actually interesting, but the execution feels very muddled. I didn't find anything interesting about the nymph's story, it suffers from trying to cram too much and the mythological characters are rather daft. After watching the film, I was saddened at how the director of a thought-provoking and atmospheric movie like The Sixth Sense could've gone to a artificial and self-indulgent movie like this one. By all means, Shyamalan has done worse, but this is definitely not his finest hour. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Lady in the Water
1,Leofwine_draca,All over the place,3,20 November 2011,"A very silly film, and one which displays M. Night Shyamalan at his worst: a director seemingly incapable of pacing and tone. This one's from the heart, an original fairy story told to one of his kids and adapted into an adult movie. While I admire Shyamalan's intentions, the result is an inexcusably bad film, one made all the more frustrating that it starts out kind of good.The first hour or so was mildly entertaining, boasting an excellent and rare leading performance from Paul Giamatti (who holds everything together) as a handyman who discovers a nymph floating in his apartment block's swimming pool. So far so unusual, but around the hour mark the film totally falls apart. Shyamalan was fine at setting up his premise, but he has no idea what to do with it once he gets there, and as a result the movie just kind of plods along until an entirely forgettable ending.Aside from Giamatti, along with brief turns from Jeffrey Wright and Freddy Rodriguez, the cast is disappointing. Shyamalan himself has a supporting role and is no actor, so it's kind of embarrassing to have him casting himself in this when somebody decent could have taken the part. The real-world interaction isn't bad, but the fairy tale type stuff that goes on is embarrassingly twee and underwritten, with ridiculous names for characters and creatures. You get the idea that Shyamalan thought he was really good for thinking this stuff up, but the truth is it's been done a hundred times better before and this turns out to be his worst film yet.",Lady in the Water
2,SnoopyStyle,so much homework,5,1 July 2015,"Mankind used to listen to those in the water. However man has gotten violent and forgotten them. Those from the water are still trying and send their young to connect with mankind where they can. Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is the super at an apartment complex. He was a doctor with a loving family but a robber broke in and killed his family. Something is wrong with the pool. Somebody is swimming at night. Farber (Bob Balaban) is a new tenant. Cleveland is saved from drowning by Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), a Narf or a sea nymph. A Scrunt is hunting Story and injures her. There's a Tartutic and she needs a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. blah... blah... blah... blah.This thing is way too loaded down with stuff. There's a simple story at its core. I don't know why Shyamalan insists on forcing the audience to learn all this stuff. This could have been so much simpler. It's well shoot and has some good actors. Shyamalan does need to stop acting. He's not good at it. I can see how this movie could have been such a thrilling adventure. This is not it.",Lady in the Water
3,claudio_carvalho,"Silly, Boring and Miscast Fable",4,27 January 2007,"The super Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) finds a woman swimming in the swimming pool of the condominium during the night; he slips, hits his head on the floor and faints in the water, and she rescues him. He discloses that she is a ""Narf"" called Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), a character of bedtime stories, that is chased by a ""Scrunt"" and she needs to return to her Blue World with an eagle. Cleveland convinces the tenants to help and protect Story.M. Night Shyamalan is like a star with an intense bright that dies in a short time. After the stunning ""The Sixth Sense"", this director produced only reasonable or crap movies. ""Lady in the Water"" is silly, boring and miscast fable, with inappropriate stupid jokes, lack of action and very poor screenplay. The boring story is too heavy for kids and imbecile for adults. Paul Giamatti is an excellent actor, but is completely miscast in an annoying stuttering character. M. Night Shyamalan has never been an actor and is ridiculous in an important role. The magnificent Bryce Dallas Howard is wasted in a terrible character that stays naked most of the time. I bought the expensive DVD, I hated the movie and I really regret the lost money. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""A Dama na Água"" (""The Lady in the Water"")",Lady in the Water
4,classicsoncall,"""There's no swimming after seven.""",6,9 August 2006,"It's been three weeks since I saw the film, and I've been thinking about it off and on ever since. I had difficulty at first deciding whether it was a genuinely brilliant exercise in film making, or a contrived piece of self indulgence from Shyamalan himself. I'm ready to side with the latter and call it a wrap.Here's why. In and of itself, the fairy tale bedtime story concept might work on the fly in real life, but here it looks like the movie itself was made up in the same fashion. What would have happened, one might ask, if the box of frosted flakes was on the other side of the oat bran? Would that have led to a different interpretation?It struck me watching the film how brazen M. Night stuck it in the face of film critics everywhere with his character Farber, brilliantly portrayed by the way by Bob Balaban. As for creating the mythology about his own self importance as a writer, I was reminded of that 'real men of genius' beer commercial - 'Nothing says I'm important more than a man shouting I'm important into his cell phone'.Redeeming qualities - there are a few. Paul Giamatti's performance was once again a pure gem of a portrayal. And lest you believe a one sided bodybuilder is too improbable to be true, there is in fact a real life counterpart to the character of Reggie in the world of sports. Anyone who's seen 'The King and His Court"" four man softball team can tell you pitcher Eddie Feigner's right arm is twice the size of his left. So at least that bit of whimsy was credible.In the end, 'Lady' didn't do it for me, and quite honestly, the only M. Night films that did were ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"". The 1960's 'Twilight Zone' TV series had an episode with a cookbook also, but that was made by an alien race with recipes for humans. Now that was an original concept. If Mr. Shyamalan goes back to making thrillers that thrill and suspense films that excite, he won't have to tell us how brilliant it is, I think we'll recognize it.",Lady in the Water
5,gavin6942,When Do You Know Your 15 Minutes Are Up?,5,6 August 2006,"M. Night is a mysterious man with a legion of adoring fans and apologists. What is most mysterious to me, though, is that he is given endless tries to be as successful as he was in the beginning. Many fans enjoyed one or two of his films (I'm partial to ""Unbreakable""), but few enjoy them all. Yet, every time he makes a new film it seems this one is a ""must-see"" because it ""might"" be as great as the others. I want to say this because I think ""Lady in the Water"" is the film that people will finally realize this man is not perfect.The story revolves around a woman from another world who comes to find a writer who will be inspired to write a story. Along the way she also recruits the help of a variety of people to be guardians, healers, a guild and other archetypes as outlined in an old Asian myth. If that was not clear, don't worry: it really is that strange, and all this before the camouflage wolves and monkeys.The cast is nothing special and the characters are interesting but forgettable. I found myself by the end of the film forgetting who characters were that I had been introduced to only an hour before. More often than not, the audience is not given enough time to become acquainted with any of the characters, leaving them all very one-dimensional. Even the lady's motivations are largely unknown and unclear, and once her mission is finished we are still left with another hour of story that seems pointless if you think about it.personally, i found the film's only redeeming aspect to be the character of the film critic. His breaking of the fourth wall (indirectly, he never addresses the audience) was quite amusing when he explained what each character represented and gave his idea of the difference between a PG and an R horror film, even invoking the ""Scream"" theory of horror - that no sex and drugs means you'll live.give ""the village"" a second chance before you rent this movie, and only rent it if you really, truly feel m. night deserves one more chance at greatness.",Lady in the Water
6,lee_eisenberg,hard to tell whether or not the idea is watered down,6,30 December 2006,"OK, by this point, we shouldn't expect M. Night Shyamalan's movies to blow our minds like ""The Sixth Sense"" did (though if one of his movies manages to do that, then good for him). If we understand that, then ""Lady in the Water"" isn't half bad, although still nothing particularly impressive. This time, they go for a more mystical feeling, with Bryce Dallas Howard as a being sent to Paul Giamatti so that he can help her move to the next phase of existence.The movie's problem is that some of the scenes look like stuff that we've seen a hundred times: a person talks, there's a pause accompanied by glossy music, and the other person overacts in responding. As for the bad guys, they just seemed a little silly (sorry, but CGI has gotten old pretty quickly).So, those are the movie's downsides. But the whole part about whom she has to find gave the flick an interesting aspect that was noticeably missing from, say, ""Signs"". ""Lady in the Water"" definitely isn't as bad as the movies that Bob Balaban's character was describing. Also starring Shyamalan himself, Sarita Choudhury, Jeffrey Wright and Mary Beth Hurt.",Lady in the Water
7,jboothmillard,Lady in the Water,2,17 July 2010,"The Sixth Sense was great, Unbreakable was good, Signs was good too, and The Village was rubbish, and then Razzie director M. Night Shyamalan tried to create tension with this. Basically stuttering maintenance man and apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) knows that someone is using the swimming pool after closing time, and he wants to find that person to tell off. He does, it is a girl named Story (The Village's Bryce Dallas Howard) who rescues him after fainting in the pool, and she explains that she is a ""Narf"". These creatures are known from some bedtime stories, and she is being chased by the ""Scrunt"", and she cannot return to the Blue World until it is rid of. To help Story return in peace, and somehow defeat the Scrunt, Cleveland recruits all the tenants of the apartments that are meant to be involved. In the end, a guardian appears to get rid of the Scrunt, and an eagle signals that Cleveland and the others have saved Story, and they say goodbye to her. Also starring Casino Royale's Jeffrey Wright as Mr. Dury, Gosford Parks' Bob Balaban as Harry Farber, Sarita Choudhury as Anna Ran, Cindy Cheung as Young-Soon Choi, Razzie winning Shyamalan as Vick Ran, Planet Terror's Freddy Rodríguez as Reggie, The Grinch's Bill Irwin as Mr. Leeds, Mary Beth Hurt as Mrs. Bell and Heroes' Noah Gray-Cabey as Joey Dury. Giamatti tries to bring his usual reliable acting to this piece of tosh, but that is all it will ever be, a completely pointless and utterly boring fantasy mystery thriller. It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay. Pretty poor!",Lady in the Water
8,ccthemovieman-1,Just Consider It An Interesting Story And Let It Go At That,8,14 January 2007,"Man, the first hour of this film was riveting and thought to myself, ""Why did this movie get so many poor reviews? I think it's great. It has drama, humor, suspense, fun characters, decent fantasy, horror....you name it. This is a real sleeper of a film.""Paul Giamatti is really as the hotel manager ""Cleveland Heep"" and Bryce Dallas Howard is believable, if you will, as ""Story, the ""sea nymph."" As long as those two dominated the screen, the movie was great.Then - wham - just like that, it got stupid. All of sudden, half of the motel residents - even though some of them are a hoot - got involved with the two main characters and it became ridiculous. They all assemble with this ""sea nymph"" bedtime story character and start playing all these ridiculous roles as ""The Interpeter,"" ""The Guild,"" ""The Healer,"" etc. The movie seems to go from an intimate suspense-fantasy to a grab-bag of crazy New Age weirdness. Within five minutes, I almost lost all interest to keep going.However, I'm glad I did because it settled down when this group-effort doesn't do the trick and things gt interesting, once again.All in all, I just took as a pure fictional fantasy Tinker Bell-type tale and let it go at that. I think this is one of the those films that could easily be over-analyzed and overly interpreted with all kinds of analogies and metaphors. I would just look at it as entertainment, and nothing else. On that level, it succeeds. It's weird......but it surely entertains.",Lady in the Water
9,Tweekums,A damp squib,4,14 July 2010,"I'd heard that this film was pretty bad before seeing it but figured that going in with low expectations I might be pleasantly surprised. Alas there were no pleasant surprises, or indeed any real surprises. The story follows building supervisor Cleveland Heep who finds a strange woman called Story in the apartment's swimming pool. She isn't an ordinary woman though, she is a 'Narf', a type of water nymph who has come to the land to help humanity. Her way of helping humanity is to get them to help her get back to her watery realm, to do this they must assemble the correct group of people; she does not tell them this though, Cleveland happens to mention her story to one of the residents and she recalls her mother telling her an 'Eastern bed-time story' about Narfs which is lucky as her mother recalls the story in enough detail for him to understand what he has today. He then sets about recruiting other people to fill the various roles after asking the advice of the resident film critic who he assumes will have seen enough films to know who should fit what role. In order to get Story back home they must keep her safe from the 'scrunt', a strange green, hyena-like creature which hides in the grass.Having enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's previous films 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Village' I was most disappointed with this, it was made worse by the fact that he also acted in it as a writer who's work was destined to change the world for the better and then be assassinated, having set himself in the Christ-role he proceeds to have a go at critics by having the critic die in a confrontation with the scrunt. Before dying the critic gives a fourth wall breaking speech saying how he is bound to survive and find redemption as that is what happens in stories lacking foul language, sex and violence. There film isn't totally without merit though, the special effects for the scrunts was pretty good and most of the actors did a good enough job given the material they were working with perhaps most importantly it was fairly short at just over an hour and a half so even though it doesn't get too boring.",Lady in the Water
10,moonspinner55,A rare misfire from M. Night Shyamalan,4,27 February 2015,"Beautifully-produced, but enervating and inconsistently-performed modern day fantasy from writer-director-co-producer M. Night Shyamalan, whose thriller-aspirations completely bottom out within this fairy tale milieu. A water nymph is discovered in the swimming pool of a Philadelphia apartment complex by the resident maintenance man, who soon engages his friends and neighbors to help the stranded beauty return to her world (in ridiculously complicated terms). In the central role, Paul Giamatti works very hard to shoulder the leaden-paced plot developments, but he ultimately fails here as he does not have a star personality or the resources of a charismatic leading man to use to his own advantage (Mel Gibson, for instance, might have excelled in this role). A character actor by nature, Giamatti tries playing this maintenance worker as a soft-hearted nice guy, a buddy to everyone, but this doesn't lend much urgency to the scenario (which is a race against time), nor does it leave viewers with anything to contemplate afterward. The supporting cast (a collection of hams and show-offs) is no help, while Bryce Dallas Howard (as the title creature) is used for her sculpted face and lanky body and not much else. *1/2 from ****",Lady in the Water
11,Quinoa1984,"a truly disastrous, ultra pretentious work of film-making that fails completely",1,19 January 2007,"I was totally boggled when Lady in the Water ended. Actually, that's a white lie, I was boggled from the very beginning. I read the signs though (no pun intended on M. Night Shyamalan's other film) from reading some reviews, and the general response from online. But I could not have expected such a rancid pile of egotistical malarkey to ever make it past any lowly production company, let alone a major studio, and that it's meant to be taken seriously, absolutely so. It almost reminded me of another film from 2006- Apocalypto- where a director hot on the heels of recent success went for broke on something burning in the filmmaker to be told. Both films, truth be told, aren't good at all, but Lady in the Water- still no pun intended (maybe some)- sinks even further. I can almost picture Shyamalan sitting in front of his computer writing out the script to this film thinking ""I am so clever. I mean, I have narfs, I have scrunts, I have a giant eagle, and porcupine monkeys that hide in the trees, what more could an audience ask for? This is so awesome."" Rarely in the history of modern movies has a director's hubris gone to such lengths and taken an audience down with them.And the shameful thing too is that the little merit that came with Shyamalan's previous film, seriously flawed The Village, was in his abilities as someone who could direct well enough up to a point. Here though, script and direction sink to lows, to the point where as an amateur filmmaker myself I felt like I had achieved a lot in comparison with this. Shyamalan cooks up some incoherent mythological 'fairy tale' (originally meant for his kids, usually not a good idea) involving Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), a maintenance man at an apartment complex, one night finds a very strange, petrified girl in the pool, and soon he finds out a) her name is 'Story', and she's b) called a 'narf' based on an old tale told to him by a Chinese lady, not to mention c) she needs to leave this place before these weird moss-covered dog creatures called 'scrunts' come after her, so d) practically all of the attendees at the apartment complex will somehow play a role in her getting safely away on the talons of an eagle.So you can imagine what could be attained from this material, which is nothing. Zero. There's not even the chance of potential as there was in Gibson's train-wreck picture. From the opening animated introduction to this magical world, things do not look good. It also doesn't help that this time, as a director, Shyamalan doesn't even halfway competently film this stuff. It looks as if the actors, who already seem incredibly stilted and with looks sometimes on their faces like 'why the hell am I in this clap trap' (Giamatti most of all), get very awkwardly, art-farty framed in compositions that do nothing to illustrate any kind of connection with the subject matter. It's self-conscious past the point of inertia, and even if one doesn't really usually pay attention to how a film is directed it won't take long to see something is f***ed up here scene after incredulous scene. And the actors, of course, end up being at the mercy of the director's own pretensions. Giamatti has to deal with cruxes like a stutter, a family of his that died, and a director who forces him and co-star Bryce Dallas Howard into whispering dialog scenes- even when he's all the way across the room from her! Other usually dependable character players like Jeffrey Wright and particularly Bob Balaban also become cannon fodder for Shyamalan's own twisted dealings, with Balaban playing a movie critic who finds there are no original stories left in movies...and then has to shamelessly comment on his own demise when it's met with a scrunt.And there's Shyamalan here, too, for the first time giving himself more than just the hapless cameo role that he's done in past films. To add on to the heap of completely illogical and just plain laughably bad camera set-ups (leaving the camera on nothing, or do a half face of a person, or do very odd cut-aways without transitions), he plays a writer who's book may save the world. Then again, he's only one piece to the Goodyear Blimp wreck that is Lady in the Water. While I've never found him to be the genius wonder-kind that he became after The Sixth Sense, his first few major successes were pretty impressive, with the occasional script flaws and annoying twists compensated by the strong performances and good sense of direction. But maybe only someone with such clout, and sparks of talent, could go so far off the deep-end as he has here. Not to be immodest about it, it becomes a litmus test to see what a filmmaker with carte-blanch can do to annoy the audience. One thing's for sure, except for unintentional purposes watching the movie with friends who feel the same way, there's no entertainment here. It's simply one of the worst films I've ever seen.",Lady in the Water
12,michaelRokeefe,Mysterious character needs help to return to...where?,6,16 January 2007,"Written, directed, produced and starring M. Night Shyamalan. The supernatural story line is based on a bedtime tale Shyamalan wrote for his kids. I admit being surprised LADY in the WATER is better than the much hyped THE VILLAGE(2004). Not that this story is any more understandable; but it at least holds some believable elements. Oopps! Forgot this is fantasy. A shy, stuttering apartment building manager, Cleveland Heep(Paul Giamatti), rescues a young woman named Story(Bryce Dallas Howard) from the swimming pool; only to find out that she is a self admitted narf...a character from a bedtime story.

13,hitchcockthelegend,"Not as bad as you all made out, Lady In The Water 2006 !",6,4 March 2008,"and by that statement I mean its rating here of just over 6 is about right IMHO , that makes it above average and I feel that the incredulous story and some very neat moments warrant it been labelled as such. The film obviously suffers from Manoj N Shyamalan losing control of his feelings with the picture, his restraint gives way to close on being smugness. Yet the picture is still beautiful in parts, and there is still a very good director at work regardless, the acting from the leads is solid but nothing out of the ordinary, but it's an interesting piece, fantastical at times, almost dreamy in quality, and I feel this will get better on a second viewing to me personally.I was expecting a total abomination based on the scorn for this film on this site, it isn't ground breaking earth shattering cinema, but it's a tidy film that sadly is not without egotistical problems.6.5/10",Lady in the Water
14,Theo Robertson,A Vanity Project Rather Than A Film,3,12 June 2009,"This film comes with a lot of baggage attached . Allegedly writer/director M Night Shyamalan had a major fall out with the studio when one of the studio heads decided to take her daughters to a birthday party rather than spend the night reading the screenplay to this film . It's also a film that bombed on its release and received universally bad reviews so I was in no rush to see it at all . After seeing it I have to agree with the majority view Some people have criticised Shymalan's movie cameos as being egotistical but with LADY IN THE WATER he's pulled out all the stops to make himself the centre of the universe . Allegedly the film is based upon a story he used as a bed time story for his children , he casts himself as Vick Ran an author whose writings will change the world . On top of that he introduces a character called Harry Farber who is effectively the movie's human villain that every one hates . And what does this villain do for a living ? That's right he's a film critic . If he wanted to be really obvious I suppose Shymalan could have called the critic Harry Knowles but everything is obvious enough - Shymalan is the king of the world while critics are bad people There's very little substance to the film , maintenance man Cleveland Heap finds a strange girl called Story in the communal swimming pool only to find she comes from another place and creatures will pursue her . I guess at this point everyone who sees the film is supposed to fall to their knees in awe that Shymalan has invented a new concept called "" Meta-fiction "" but an audience is more likely to throw popcorn at the screen than bow . Not only that but the narrative moves at a snail's pace and despite several startle moments involving loud noises there's no tension and you'll be completely puzzled if this is trying to be a supernatural fantasy or not . There's little drama , atmosphere or frights to be had I have to admit I have enjoyed this writer/director's work in the past . UNBREAKABLE remains an underrated masterpiece in my opinion and while there were several flaws to the screenplay to SIGNS it still remains a highly atmosphericmmovie . Unfortunately since then Shymalan seems to have believed his own hype about being the new Spielberg and has become the new Alan Smithee",Lady in the Water
15,poolandrews,A unique film that divides opinion.,5,17 July 2010,"Lady in the Water is set in The Cove apartment block somewhere in Philadelphia, Cleveland Heep (Rob Giamatti) is the manager & one night goes outside to investigate splashing in the complex pool. Heep spots someone in the pool & goes in after them but is dragged under the water, Heep comes round in his apartment & sees a young woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) sitting by him who introduces herself as a Narf from the Blue World as heard about in fairy tales. After some research Heep discovers that a Narf is a rare water nymph & that evil creatures known as Scrunt's live in the grass around the apartment block waiting to kill Story in order to prevent her & her kind from influencing the human race. Story claims that someone living at the apartment block will write a future changing book while all the tenant work together to get Story back to the Blue World where she belongs...Written, produced & directed by M. Night Shyamalan who also has a fairly big part in the film as a writer (who will write something that will change all of humanity no less) this fantasy drama was widely panned by critics & divides opinion which is easy to understand, personally I thought Lady in the Water was a quite rewarding experience although it's certainly not without it's problems. Based on a bedtime story Shyamalan used to tell his children there's a strong magical & fantastical fairytale element here with a whole ancient mythical back-story, a hero, some monsters & some touching & uplifting moments amongst the strong moral message. While at a one hour & fifty odd minutes long Lady in the Water takes a while to get going it does set-up a complicated back-story quite nicely & the overall message that everyone in life has a purpose is beautifully worked into the script. Lady in the Water is surprisingly quite touching & sensitive, a film that I imagine was meant to bring hope & to try & inspire faith. The character's are good, Shyamalans writing style remains the same as character's have moments rather than big dramatic outburst & Shyamalans obviously deliberate little dig at the arrogance of critics (& in particular in Lady in the Water a film critic which I suspect is no coincidence) didn't go unnoticed. On the downside Lady in the water is hard to take seriously, the mixing of contemporary modern life & the silliness of the fairytale like story set within it is quite jarring, the story is often rather ambiguous & things are deliberately left vague which means you come away from watching it feeling like you missed something.Shyamalan directs with subtlety & there's minimum use of CGI computer effects, the one present are pretty good but by the time a giant Eagle swoops from the sky to whisk Story off back to the Blue World with the apartment block tenants looking on in amazement I was starting to question just what the hell I was watching. Shyamalan famously walked out of Disney who were originally going to make Lady in Water citing 'creative differences' but in reality he got annoyed at the head of Disney after she said she didn't like the script. Part fantasy, part drama, part horror & part mystery Lady in the Water requires patience to get through & a little bit of thought too but if your prepared to stick it out then I think it's worthwhile.With a supposed budget of about $75,000,000 this wasn't a box-office success & I can sort of see why, filmed in Pennsylvania. The acting is good, the main cast are very good & really bring a warmth to the material.Lady in the Water is a slow moving film but all the carefully laid pieces of the puzzle fall into place at the end to make it worthwhile, sure it's totally ridiculous & impossible to take seriously at times but I did like the quaint fairytale story & the things it tried to say.",Lady in the Water
16,Bunuel1976,"LADY IN THE WATER (M. Night Shyamalan, 2006) **",4,8 March 2007,"I was aware of the negative reception that greeted this film but, having watched all of the director's work from THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) onwards, I knew I'd get to it sooner or later. Well, I can't say that I disagree with the film's legion of detractors: all in all, it seems to me that Shyamalan is fast becoming the new Michael Cimino  what with his output having undergone a steady decline (even being awarded a Razzie as the year's Worst Director for this latest outing!).The fantasy elements of the plot showed promise (with the animated prologue being pretty much the best thing about the entire film!) but these were defeated by a largely muddled approach. Besides, the film has a decent cast (Paul Giamatti  though his stuttering character raises several unintentional chuckles, Bryce Dallas Howard  surprisingly enough, much less effective here than she had been in Shyamalan's THE VILLAGE [2004], Bob Balaban, Jeffrey Wright, Mary Beth Hurt, Jared Harris, and even the director himself  who was, perhaps, undeserving of the Razzie for Worst Supporting Actor) but they're all at sea, being either unsuitably cast or playing unsympathetic characters! The film is even pretentious where names are concerned: nobody ever raises an eyebrow about Howard and Giamatti's characters being called Story and Cleveland respectively; similarly, the terminology they come up with for the various mythical creatures is quite silly! Another definite low point is the excessive importance given to the two obnoxious Chinese women, who are the only ones familiar with the folk-tale that could determine Howard's future.

Yet, the person who wrote the description for HBO spoke of Paul Giamatti's outstanding performance and called the film mesmerizing. Yet, they gave it one star. I was so confused that I had to take the time to watch it. I am glad I did.Paul Giamatti was, indeed, outstanding, and the film was mesmerizing. Maybe people went expecting a horror flick and were disappointed with a fairy tale. But what a fairy tale. Something we can believe in: that we all do, indeed, have a purpose, and that we are all connected. Going back and viewing this film again with that in mind just might make a difference.Along with Giamatti, I was captivated by Cindy Cheung as Young-Soon Choi. Writer/Director M.

18,zardoz-13,Wonderful Change of Pace for Shyamalan,10,25 February 2012,"After the complex, demanding likes of ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs,"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" is a welcome relief because it doesn't rely on high wattage celebrity star power to make its points. Instead, this simple, symbolic, fairy tale of sorts toplines typical supporting player Paul Giamatti as a custodian at a high-rise apartment who has to contend with an enigmatic young water nymph who shows up under mysterious circumstances in the swimming pool. In a way, ""Lady in the Water"" is a heavier version of ""Splash"" except that this unusual maiden hails from another world that she calls 'the Blue World' and which she remains tight-lipped about when questioned. Unlike most of Shyamalan's melodramas that boasted surprising O'Henry endings, ""Lady in the Water"" is pretty much a straightforward affair as a motley collection of residents combine their skills and talents to help a lost girl return to her world. Mind you, some of the usual Shamalan madness remains. For example, the protagonist has a tragic backstory, but Shyamalan concentrates on his efforts to unravel the mystery of the girl and the radically different world that she comes from.",Lady in the Water
19,grantss,A further sign that M Night Shyamalan was running out of ideas...,3,30 May 2014,"M Night Shyamalan's first two movies, Praying with Anger (1992) and Wide Awake (1998) were quite nondescript and forgettable (in fact, if it wasn't for IMDb I would never have heard of them). However, his third film shot him to stardom. The Sixth Sense (1999) was brilliant and he deserved all the accolades and acclaim that came with it. Then came Unbreakable (2000), which was pretty good. Signs (2002) and The Village (2004) were sort of OK, but showed that maybe he was a one- hit wonder and was running out of ideas. Lady in the Water (2006) reinforces this theory.Lady in the Water is pretty lame, incoherent and uninteresting. At best it is a children's fairy tale, but even they might find it nonsensical.Even the great acting talent that is Paul Giamatti cannot save this. Avoid.",Lady in the Water
20,Boba_Fett1138,Just plain bad and silly.,4,14 July 2010,"Never expected this movie to be good but I certainly did also not expected it to be as bad as it turned out to be.Guess somewhere deep inside of it the movie had some potential and some original ideas but the movie just doesn't ever do something good or interesting with it. It's not really an entertaining movie, not a tense one at all and not mysterious enough or fantasy like. It basically feels like a quite pointless movie to watch, that is a lot but is also nothing at the same time.With ""Unbreakable"" M. Night Shyamalan delivered a realistic super-hero movie. With ""Signs"" he delivered a realistic science-fiction movie (till the last minutes at least). With this movie he tried to deliver a realistic fairy-tale. His approach totally failed though, which is not only due to his misplaced directing approach but also really due to its story, which he also wrote on his own by the way.Sorry, just nothing really makes sense in this movie. I can go along with some imaginative storytelling, with strange worlds and magical characters but this movie is just lacking in all and it's story is just plain silly. No one seems to think its strange and unlikely at all that a water nymph suddenly appears and everybody decides to help out, without asking any questions. It's obviously that M. Night Shyamalan tried to put all kinds of deeper meanings to the story and characters in it, about believing in stories and making your own and everyone and everything has a purpose in life but absolutely nothing about it works out. It instead makes the movie more silly and also certainly slower. Just can't really think of a right audience that might end up liking this movie. The movie was probably intended as magical and maybe even uplifting but M. Night Shyamalan ruined all of his, potentially good, own ideas.Due to its directing approach the movie also visually was a disappointing one. The movie tries to be less Hollywood like and more independent like. Sounds like a good idea but it makes this a very self indulgent one that is all too aware of itself and of the different style it tries to create. This is most apparent in the distracting cinematography with some annoying and above all pointless camera-angels, that really take you out of the movie. The special effects were also really disappointingly bad. Simply not acceptable for 2006 movie standards, especially not when you have such an high budget to work with, as this movie had.Paul Giamatti is a good actor and while he also is still good in this, I just think that he is one of those actors that is always better off playing the secondary character. I don't know, he just isn't that interesting as a main lead, which might also be really due to his looks. M. Night Shyamalan obviously tried to make a star out of Bryce Dallas Howard, after already have cast her in his previous movie ""The Village"" but he instead almost single handedly ruined it, by making her character extremely boring and give her absolutely nothing interesting to do. A positive note on its casting; I did like Jeffrey Wright and Bob Balaban in this. M. Night Shyamalan also once more gave himself an acting role in this movie, with a big difference this time that it is quite a large role. And no, he just isn't much good in it.

It took a lot of imagination and creativity, the movie was also good but it doesn't quite live up to other Shyamalan projects. I was able to follow the movie and get into it somewhat, but it just seemed like he was trying to cram too much into too little. There wasn't enough character development, and even the story in the movie didn't feel completed. Not only that, I think the creatures were a bit out of place and needed more explanation. I would have liked to know more about the important characters, and I definitely would have liked to know more about the different creatures in the movie.

23,ferguson-6,Where's the Cereal Aisle?,5,21 July 2006,"Greetings again from the darkness. Without a doubt, M Night Shyamalan is one of our most creative filmmakers. With that creative nature comes hits and misses. Sadly, after two remarkable films (""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"") came a mediocre thriller (""Signs"") and now two flops (""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water""). Based on an original bedtime story that Mr. Shyamalan told his kids, this one is nothing more than a lame campfire story a bunch of 9 year olds would make up on the spot at midnight in the woods.The only thing standing in the way of total disaster is an excellent cast lead by an (even for him) frumpy Paul Giamatti. That Kevin Costner's name was even mentioned as the possible lead makes me nauseous. Giamatti plays the big-hearted maintenance guy to a slightly downtrodden troupe of tenants at The Cove - itself a slightly downtrodden apartment complex.Things go a bit crazy when Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter and the blind girl from ""The Village"") pops up out of the swimming pool after hours. Somehow Giamatti puts the pieces together that this is all directly from a legendary eastern mythological story and he proceeds to assemble the jigsaw puzzle in order to save Story - the odd named girl from the water. What makes this such a joke is that Giamatti runs into no doubters as he assembles the super team necessary to send her back to her world. No reporters are called. No paparazzi. No pictures for themselves. Who are these people? Don't they question anything? Mr. Shyamalan casts himself in a crucial role that is laughable. Can you imagine Spielberg, Hitchock or any other ""great"" director doing this? Of course not ... but few share his ego. Beyond that, the supporting cast is stellar. Jeffrey Wright (""Syriana""), Freddy Rodriguez, Bill Irwin and Mary Beth Hurt all lend credence to the project. Bob Balaban (""Seinfeld"") is a welcome comic relief in his all too brief time.Despite the cast and the always interesting Shyamalan camera angles, this one just comes up very empty and very lame. The whole story is too confusing and the evil lurking in the shadows is just too non-disrupt. By the way, can someone with Giamatti's less than Olympic swimmer build be reasonably expected to hold his breath for however many minutes it took him to save the world? And don't miss the Bob Dylan references ... ""Maggie's Farm"" being the most creative.",Lady in the Water
24,anaconda-40658,Get Out of the Water.,2,8 August 2015,"Lady in the Water (2006): Dir: M. Night Shyamalan / Cast: Paul Giamatti, Bryce Dallas Howard, Bob Balaban, Jeffrey Wright, M. Night Shyamalan: M. Night Shyamalan misfired with this mess about mystery and suspense. He uses too many confusing shots that draw unnecessary attention. This film had all sorts of ideas that got strewn into a tremendous disaster. The premise regards an apartment manager rescuing a woman in the swimming pool only to discover that she is a figment from a bedtime story in desperate need to get back to where she came from. Story drags with every boring minute until reaching an idiotic climax. Shyamalan's first four films were imaginative, suspenseful and entertaining. Here he dumps everything out and is in desperate need of a vacuum cleaner. He also makes an appearance as an actor just to prove that he can render this film worse. The special effects are creative and that is about the extent of it because the screenplay is like a game of Operation only all the pieces seem misplaced. Paul Giamatti gives a phony stutter while Bryce Dallas Howard comes across as a victim of a hangover. Perhaps he should kick her to the curb and tell her to stop using up all the hot water. Bob Balaban gives two cents worth of bedtime story jargon while Jeffrey Wright plays an interpreter. Perhaps he can interpret why an idea about fables is flushed down the toilet.

25,Wuchakk,Moving magical tale at an apartment complex in Philadelphia,6,11 August 2021,"A superintendent at an apartment building in a suburb of Philadelphia (Paul Giamatti) discovers an innocent redhead in the pool (Bryce Dallas Howard) who needs the assistance of several tenants to escape the creatures that threaten her and her mission.""Lady in the Water"" (2006) is a drama/fantasy based on a bedtime story that writer/director M. Night Shyamalan told his kids. Like most Shyamalan pictures there's a moving reverent ambiance amidst the amusing and sometimes horrific dramatics. It's very original, coming across as a Shyamalan flick mixed with elements of fantasy movies, like ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939). Think about it, ""The Wizard of Oz"" meshed a family drama with a dreamlike fantasy involving wonder, humor and slight horror along with a profound message, and so does this film (which isn't to say it's as effective as ""Wizard"").The set of the apartment complex and the cinematography thereof combined with James Newton Howard's score are all superb. Plus there are some amusing moments, like with the dour film critic (Bob Balaban). Similar to ""Signs"" (2002), there's a good theme about coming to grips with tragedy and moving on with a newfound sense of purpose. Moreover, Bryce is very appealing as the naïve fantasy creature and the movie leaves you with a warm feeling.On the negative side, the somewhat convoluted fable will be less than compelling for certain viewers and some critics understandably complained that it was a mistake for Shyamalan to cast himself as the writer whose words are the seeds to changing the world, although it didn't bother me; I think he's perfect for the role. Still, M. Night casting himself as the savior of the freakin' planet is a tad pretentious.The film runs 1 hour, 49 minutes, and was shot in Levittown, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Philadelphia.GRADE: B-",Lady in the Water
26,gradyharp,A Perplexing Film from M. Night Shyamalan,5,26 December 2006,"LADY IN THE WATER is a very tough film to review. M. Night Shyamalan is doubtless a new thinker and has produced some original and interesting films (none of which equal the promise of his first one THE SIXTH SENSE) and LADY IN THE WATER has some very good aspects. It is just such a mixed bag, full of holes and hints of personal vendettas that it ultimately fails to achieve what it sets out to do.The opening sequence tells a tale in charming line drawings about how we all used to be water people but how man gradually went on land, gained money and power, and became estranged from the purity of the water people: the ladies of the water will try to return reason to the land people but the journey will be fraught with danger.Transfer that tale to real time and we find the disconsolate manager of an apartment house Cleveland Heep (a brilliant, stammering Paul Giammati) whose rules for the building dwellers include no smoking and no swimming in the pool after seven evening. He discovers a swimmer in the night pool, rescues her, learns her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and gives her a Gilead in his meager room. He discovers with the help of one of his tenant's Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) hesitant mother that Story is a narf, a creature from a bedtime story who is sent from the Blue World to imbue reason to a certain man (One who will return 'civilization' to mankind) and then return to her world on the wings of an eagle. Heep takes it upon himself to find the One who will allow Story to complete her mission, protecting her from the monsters in the night that would destroy her plight.In seeking the One, we meet the buildings tenants: Reggie (Freddy Rodríguez) bent on working out only one side of his body (!); Mr. Dury (the always fine Jeffrey Wright) who is committed to solving crossword puzzles with his son Joey (Noah Gray-Cabey); a Mrs. Hill (Mary Beth Hurt) who seems to have spiritual affinities; the odd Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin) who foresees things; a newspaper critic (Bob Balaban); a writer Vick Ran (M. Night Shyamalan himself), who appears to be the One who will answer the goal of Story, and his sister Anna (Sarita Choudhury): and a bizarre group of smokers and a family of Hispanic immigrant sisters. All of these characters are woven into the conclusion of the bedtime story as we watch the initial tale come to resolution.It plays better on paper than on film as there are so many loops and problems with the plot that it becomes silly. But the film is saved by the actors, Giamatti especially, who makes us love him and his very troubled past shrouded in secrets, and Howard who truly does allow us to suspend disbelief in her otherworldly portrayal of the lonely and needy water nymph. You simply have to be in the mood for this kind of film and forgive Shyamalan his oversights and vanity, and if you can do that it is a pleasant little diversion. Grady Harp",Lady in the Water
27,zetes,Quite likely the most original American film of 2006,6,8 January 2007,"With that and the excellent performance given by Paul Giamatti, I have to have at least a bit of affection for the film, which is otherwise kind of a mess. Not to mention very silly. Giamatti plays an apartment building superintendent who discovers a strange woman living in the bottom of their swimming pool. She is apparently some kind of water nymph who is being hunted by a grass-furred wolf. If she can get past the beast, a giant eagle will lift her into the sky and bring her home. Hopefully the three giant twig monkeys, along with the uniquely purposeful residents of the apartment complex, can guard her from the grass wolf monster. Seriously. Oh, and the director, M. Night Shyamalan, plays a man who, in the near future, will publish a book that will, Wyld Stallyns style, bring about world peace. And there's a film critic character, played by Bob Balaban, who is ruthlessly ridiculed in the script. I think the thing, as ambitious as it is, could have worked with a few more script revisions. I swear there must have been some important exposition missing near the beginning of the film. And the nymph character, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is awful. As The Onion put it, she comes off like she's the product of a drunken one night stand between Darryl Hannah in Splash and ET. I do want to rewatch it someday, as I was quite tired when I saw it. If it is as sloppy as it seemed, I think it'll be due for a remake in a decade or two, possibly even by M. Night himself, if they'll let him work after this debacle, as many have dubbed it.",Lady in the Water
28,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Lady in the Water,10,28 July 2006,"I love it. And in the spirit of all movies Shyamalan, I'll keep mum about the plot.I loved the pace, the control, and the development of how the plot unfolded. It had a whodunnit feel of a mystery that is carefully revealed layer by layer. The ensemble cast and characters were fantastic, with each character possessing usefulness to the story and to peer characters, and their eccentricities make them a joy to watch. You have the Korean mother and daughter, the Vietnam Vet, a father and son, a new neighbour, a group of cock-talkers, a guy who works out only his right side, and so on. Although most of them are one- dimensional, they are no less than endearing in their own way, like those in Cocoon or Batteries Not Included.I love the superb acting by the main leads of Paul Giamatti, who's fast becoming one of my favourite character actors, and in here, provided his character Cleveland Heep with much emotional baggage, pain and that almost natural stammer when nervous, and Bryce Dallas Howard, her Lady in the Water, name Story, is so beautiful, yet so enchantingly vulnerable. Both anchor this movie well and brought about believable character development, or in the case of Story, that oracle air of wisdom, wit and fear of the unknown.I love the special effects, done no less by Industrial Light and Magic. They're a pretty sight, even though some scenes were dark, literally and figuratively. Cinematography was done by Christopher Doyle, so those in Asia should already well be aware what he's capable of.There's a major departure from his previous films, which I think is probably good to keep things refreshing for the moment. Some points and scenes in the movie are so deceptively simple that you will almost guess the outcome before the next scene transition. The movie ended the way it should, instead of relying on the ""next big gimmick"". And probably bad news of those who loathe directors cameo-ing in the own movies, well, this time round, Shyamalan has quite a significant role for himself.And I know why many critics out there didn't give this movie the rating it deserves. They are surprised at Shyamalan's audacity in taking a huge swipe at critics in general, since they have been highly critical of almost all his past works. It's an obvious no-holds-barred jibe at their anal characters of being high and mighty and of imposing their thoughts and opinions on others, when little do they know that their opinions mean squat most of the time. There's another cheeky reference too at romances in the rain, which I thought perhaps cinematographer Doyle would have found it amusing given his work on Wong Kar-wai's In the Mood for Love and 2046 (citing these 2 as I've recently watched the former).But those aside, thank you M Night, for sharing with us a wonderful bedtime story, which I think will be repeated at bedtime to many children around the world.

30,siderite,"Full of deep meanings, but ultimately boring",7,3 March 2007,"When the movie started, and because of the title, I thought it will all be another mermaid film, so I started with low expectations. But then everything gained slowly, yet continuously, momentum and sense, and exposed the more complex underlying ideas.Now, I think the premise of the movie was very interesting. What would you do if you were caught in a story and you knew the basic plot already, but you didn't know exactly how and when things are going to happen and more importantly who is who in the story? The plot circled around this idea and slowly exposed itself like an onion or like a blooming flower, petal by petal. Also the cast was very good, each of the actors playing really well.But here the praise stops. Even if I would have liked and identified with the story that begets this movie (and I haven't), most of the movie was boring. The entire film had the feel of a low budget movie, everything happening in the same place, the creatures mostly implied than shown (and when shown the CGI was plain and uncorrelated with the acting)and the mostly unknown cast.A movie critic I enjoy reading said this film will awaken the kid inside people like a fairytale. It was mostly a fairytale, but my child was fast asleep. There were some interesting concepts and some degree of novelty, so I recommend watching this, but just be warned that it is a trip for the brain, there is no action, mostly no obvious feelings are involved and the pace is slow.",Lady in the Water

Edgar Allen PoeIf you know I love Twilight Zone, X Files, and Lost, you can predict I'll favor M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water, a fairy tale about a mysterious young lady (Bryce Dallas Howard) who surfaces at a motel swimming pool, carrying with her the myths children grow up with about a nether world of sea nymphs, monsters who pursue them, and trolls who guard her.It's up to handyman Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) to save her from her enemies and himself from his own tragic past. Together with their redemption comes an entire community of motel dwellers, whose mundane lives gain significance as they help in the rescue. One of the dwellers happens to be a film and art critic (Bob Balaban), an obvious representative of the doltish, formula-ridden reviewers director/writer Shyamalan has encountered in his still young but productive years.And Shyamalan has crafted a tale to confound the traditionalists with bizarre heroes and monsters, childlike wonder with imaginative fears, and childish delight at plot turns and character motivations. All of which makes for disorienting narrative, which, if viewed as an extension of the director's ego, turns away some audience that sees only self indulgence (Rumor says the director told this story to his children at bedtime). For this reviewer, who is not above characterizing himself as a man-child, everyman Heep, like his namesake Uriah Heep in David Copperfield, pokes around where he doesn't belong, mostly in everybody else's business, mostly because that's his job.",Lady in the Water

33,Buddy-51,regrettable failure,4,10 August 2006,"Anyone who has ever taken a course in basic fiction writing knows that the first thing you learn is the old ""show don't tell"" rule of storytelling. It's ironic, then, that this is the very thing that M Night Shyamalan - hitherto one of the most innovative and imaginative of modern day storytellers - seems to have forgotten in his latest film, ""Lady in the Water,"" the first truly disappointing movie the young writer/director has made to date (and, no, I'm not forgetting ""The Village,"" which I liked much more than most people did). Unlike, say, the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy or the ""Star Wars"" films, in which the filmmakers allow us to see and enter into the fantastical and mythological worlds they've created, in ""Lady in the Water"" the characters spend most of their time DESCRIBING rather than showing us the imaginary world of their story, resulting in a static, talky film that fails to engage the viewer in any truly meaningful way.The wonderful Paul Giamatti stars as Cleveland, the sweet-natured, milquetoast-y manager of a multi-storied apartment building on the outskirts of Philadelphia. One night Cleveland discovers a strange woman swimming in the pool after dark, an intruder he soon discovers to be a sea nymph (called a ""narf"") who has come from the mysterious ""blue world"" to bring a message of hope to mankind. Unfortunately, this creature, who calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, who played a similar emissary-to-a-strange-world role in ""The Village""), has also inadvertently brought with her a menacing wolf-like monster which threatens to destroy her before she can make it successfully back to her own world. With the help of a number of other, amazingly credulous residents of the complex, Cleveland is able to piece together elements of the mystery in the hope of helping Story to do what she came to do and then return safely home.As with his earlier films, Shyamalan is far more interested in mood and imagery than in easy melodrama and cheap thrills. However, in this case, the film gets so bogged down in explanations and exposition that it winds up talking itself and us to a standstill. The screenplay cheats right off the bat by relying on an outsider's knowledge of the tale to relate the key elements rather than letting those elements reveal themselves naturally and organically. As a consequence, the film is never able to convince us of its authenticity, while the plot points begin to feel increasingly arbitrary and silly the longer the movie drones on.Unfortunately, the film's visual style is every bit as incoherent as the storyline. For some reason, as a director, Shyamalan proves unable to establish or maintain spatial unity in his misc-en-scene. He never gives us a clear view of the entire courtyard, so that we are unable to tell where the woods are in relation to the building or even if the woods are real at all (that would certainly be an intriguing concept, though I honestly don't think that was Shyamalan's intention). For long stretches of the film, we expend our energies trying to orient ourselves in the film's geography, something even the least competent director should be able to do for his audience. At times we seem to be trapped in some type of concrete fortress, while, at other times and from other angles, the setting seems positively bucolic, overrun with thick vegetation and with Cleveland living in what appears to be a quaint little cottage nestled cozily in some nearby woods (but which is somehow supposed to be only a stone's-throw from the apartment's pool). The film looks as if it were shot at two entirely different locales, and that Shyamalan was unable to meld them into anything even remotely approximating a seamless whole.And that seems to be the biggest problem with ""Lady in the Water."" It always feels incompletely formed and half-baked, a thing of bits and pieces rather than a wholly rounded and fully developed work of art. Shyamalan has struck out in his own ballpark.",Lady in the Water
34,thesar-2,The Little Minded Mermaid,1,29 May 2013,"""How's the writing?"" Cleveland stutters.""Slow,"" replies Vick (probably should've) Ran.No truer words were spoken in one of the most ineptly shot, annoyingly uninspired and hilariously bad chapter in M. Night Shyamalan's long list of bad ideas. Want proof? His title character of Lady in the Water is namedStory.As much as I hate M. Night's films, even though they give me great joy in unintentional humor, he's never one to really shoot a film worse than a film school dropout. 30 minutes in and I cannot believe he would allow the close-ups of peoples backsides and horrible angles be shown. Unless, that is his fetish.If it is, that's all the more disturbing. Even more for the poor audience having to witness one disastrous scene after the next. It's more alarming because this was supposed to be a ""children's bedtime story,"" meant for his kids and all we see is more backsides than actual characters.Besides the horrible filming, there's an almost endless supply of bad creations in this boring story. Wait, I'll stop thereI get it now! It's purposely boring to put the kids to sleep quicker. Okay, you get that one, M. Night.I digress. This movie's bad on so many levels, it's tough to list them all. But, I'll try.The racist and stereotypical characters are just plain stupid. Yes, that's pretty nondescript and adolescent to write, but when you can see them in the rare full-shot, they're more cardboard than a Peter Piper Pizza specialty pie and more caricature than the pop-up book this M. Night loon probably viewed for inspiration. The locales are boring, the mood is tenseless, the background story is laughable and the comedy is nonexistent. Further, I can tolerate many different disabilities, and I get why the main character, Giamatti's Cleveland, stutters, but he's all-but making fun of real-life people who suffer from that problem.The bent list actually goes on in this silly story and I will say it includes the fact M. Night should never star in his own films. Yeah, I get he's a pompous, overly bigheaded director, but to give a face – literally – to the one that makes me so mad I wasted my time, is not comforting. I don't like the fact my hatred is boiling as he's on screen.It's almost hilarious to give the synopsis, because of how ludicrous it is, but suffice to say, it's about a man finds a water lady who is chased by jokes in the leaves and needs a writer and an eagle to be carried away. Yes, it's that simple, odd and uninteresting.Oh, and I almost forgot, as a poor attempt at tongue-in-cheek or an insult, M. Night includes a movie critic character that blatantly points out all the wrongs in a bad film. In what I suspect is to bash his own critics, M. Night actually does point out what's wrong with his own film. If you can call this a film. And what's even worse, he doesn't even understand what a real movie critic does, or how they act. It's like making a cartoon character of a football player using a stick figure.As the movie progresses and gets more and more preposterous, the inconsistencies, terribly writing, odd behaviors, out-of-character dialogue and interest in any of the leads become as distant in the viewer's mind as the Delta Quadrant. Hell, I can see where ""horror"" is supposed to be involved, maybe even a little of suspense, but it's so muddy and obscure, this is as scary as a car manual.One of the character's books he's writing is called ""Cookbook."" In this case, I hope Gordon Ramsey cusses out M. Night's terrible creation.""I'm not anything, you know. I don't think I'm anything specialWhy are people suddenly going to take me seriously?"" asks M. Night's own character, Vick. FINALLY we agree on something.",Lady in the Water
35,cherold,"I don't care what anyone else says, I like this a lot",8,3 July 2007,"Wow, people sure do hate this movie. I don't understand why it has engendered such hostility. I mean, I can see problems in the movie that people could object to, but people are calling this the worst movie in years and the like, and I find that completely out of proportion.So here's what I think: Direction Shyamalan has made movies before featuring ostensible everyman types, but this time he has moved away from Hollywood-everyman to a genuine everyman by casting Paul Giamatti as a sad sack building super. Giamatti is likable and quite funny, and the movie starts off with a breezy humor that instantly made me like it.There are problems when the plot kicks in with the appearance of a young woman named Story. It turns out she might be a creature called a narf from a Chinese fairytale, so the first problem is, narf isn't remotely Chinese-sounding.Still, I liked the way the movie builds, as Giamatti tries to help her and discovers neighborliness and credulity aren't dead. I enjoy the movie's optimism about people even if I don't share in it, and I like the way he spreads his typical revelations throughout instead of sticking them all at the end.While people have claimed the story is slow, I thought it was well paced. And while I can admit to many of the criticized plot holes, I just don't care; it had the feel of a little fairy tale of the modern age, which I found quite charming. And the movie is frequently amusing, which counts for a lot with me.My main criticism is that Lady in the Water would be a much better film with two minutes taken out. Shyamalan decided to savage movie critics, apparently stung by the deserved panning of The Village (which inexplicably received more positive criticism than this film). That's fine in itself, but in one scene Shyamalan simply steps outside of the movie to make fun of the critic. In itself it's a rather amusing scene, but you don't carefully create an atmosphere and encourage a suspension of disbelief and then just shock the audience into the real world in a petty act of vengeance. Shyamalan ignores one of the fundamental rules of film making; if any scene, even if it's the best scene in the film, takes away from the whole, you cut it. I'm very disappointed in Shamalyan for allowing his bitterness to trump his common sense.It's a small thing, and I won't say it ruined the movie, but it was jarring. And perhaps that's part of why the reviews are so bad, because that scene made people drifting along on the movie's logic snap awake and start thinking about everything that was wrong. Although that's just a theory. Anyway, cut out that two minutes and it would be a considerable improvement.As for people complaining the movie isn't that scary, well, I don't think it was trying to be that scary. I do think the director's intent is more important than what he's done in other movies. Just because he usually tries to scare us doesn't mean he is this time; I think he was just going for some mild suspense.Anyway, while others are saying Shyamalan has lost it, but for me he's been consistent; one good movie, one bad one. Sixth Sense (great), Unbreakable (tedious, but interesting ending), Signs (good movie, tremendous ending), The Village (wretched) and Lady in the Water (funny and charming).So I don't have high hopes for the next one, but this one was quite enjoyable.",Lady in the Water
36,Robert_duder,"Fantastic, Original, brilliant and captivating!!",10,31 July 2006,"It is so very sad that in a day and age when Hollywood churns out films that critics claim as garbage, and it's the same old recycled, seen before trash that something like this isn't hailed by critics and top of the box office for fans. M. Night Shyamalan's brilliant tale is one of his best but the man has done some brilliant work up till now. It's not secret that Shyamalan seems to be an acquired taste. He has almost a cult following it seems of people that absolutely adore his brilliance. I say he has completely outdone himself with Lady In The Water. Not only has he created this brilliant story with an ensemble cast of mysterious and interesting characters but he created an entire fairy tale that this story bases itself around. This is completely unique and original inside and out and that is something to be proud of. On top of that it is so watchable, captivating and interesting. I sincerely hope that none of the bad reviews brings Shyamalan down because he has outdone himself this time and gave me an incredible experience at the theater.Paul Giamatti takes the lead role as classically haunted and brilliantly melancholy Cleveland Heep. This is a typical Shyamalan character and one of his absolute best going straight up there with Bruce Willis' Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Samuel L. Jackson's Mr. Glass and Mel Gibson's Graham Hess, all absolutely classic characters in cinema and Giamatti's Heep belongs there 100%. Giamatti outdoes himself and gives another Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Heep makes a great hero because he is not. He's the average guy, stuck in a rut, sad, and we know something has caused his melancholy but it unfolds slowly. He is given reason to come alive again with the discovery of a stranger who saves his life. Bryce Dallas Howard plays the mysterious Story. A water Fairy who must accomplish an important deed to the future of mankind and the small apartment complex is the link to this deed. I admit I wasn't crazy about Howard's performance in The Village but she fits this role perfectly. She is mysterious, disturbed, pale, and perfectly suited for this. She still wasn't my favorite character in the film but she does well in the role. One of the most fantastic elements of Lady In The Water is this incredible ensemble cast including none other than Shyamalan himself in an intriguing and important role. Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, Sarita Choudhury, Cindy Cheung, Freddy Rodríguez, Bill Irwin, Mary Beth Hurt, and Noah Gray-Cabey all deserve mention as they play variations of important parts in the story. I must single out Cindy Cheung who is terrific as the punk rocker student who seems to be quite close to Heep. I think her boisterous ""Goodbye Mr. Heep"" will become a classic in my books. Also Bob Balaban as the rather sour movie critic Mr. Farber and if this was Shyamalan's dig at his rather harsh critics it was hilariously done!! Balaban's character is subtle but meets his end is a rather sarcastic and clever demise poking fun at the movie plot and critics in general. Shyamalan himself plays a very, very good role as the important Vick who has a bigger purpose in life that is dropped on him.The film unravels at break neck speed and everything is discovered and unraveled and carefully dealt with all coming back to this fascinating and original fairy tale that Shyamalan has created. The creature stalking the Water fairy from the grass is terrifying and definitely makes the suspense first rate. One of the most amazing things about this film is that this mind binding, imaginative story all takes place in one tiny area. Never once does this film leave the apartment complex. For the most part the bulk of the film takes place at the pool side and yet you barely notice because Shyamalan makes the story so incredibly interesting. As far as I'm concerned if this wasn't already the case this film puts the nail in Shyamalan being one of the most talented writers and directors in Hollywood. He has such an incredibly unique style and I have loved his films since day one. Bravo for this one because it was amazing!! Everyone that loves something unique and suspenseful and interesting will love this film!! 10/10",Lady in the Water
37,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,M gets a bit lazy here...,2,24 August 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh Critics have been pretty unanimous in their condemnation of this, the latest work of distinctive Hollywood horror-meister M Night Shyamalan. Consistent bad reviews are probably to blame for the film being a huge flop and making a pretty hasty exit from cinemas. Shyamalan is like a model student who appears to have lost his desire to impress. Although I've always admired his approach to the films he makes, he's never done anything that's absolutely blown me away (Signs was probably the film of his that did it most for me.) But even I can notice how he's gone from having a desire to show impressive, high-concept films that are designed to impress movie-goers with their originality to making such a simple and uninspiring story like this.The plot, such as it is, is just some jumbled, uninteresting nonsense about an apartment owner, played by Paul Giamatti, struggling to recover from a personal tragedy, who discovers a young woman making a splash in his pool one night. He comes to learn she is being held back in his world by dark forces from her plane of existence and he must draw on all his strength and confront his own demons to save her.I liked Giamatti a lot with his role in the film Sideways but he gives a terrible performance here, sniffling loudly in an attempt to give a stutter and being generally unconvincing in his role. With a leading actor this bad, it's no surprise that the supporting cast are left to fade into the background without making an impact. All the little touches that let you know it's a Shyamalan film are in place here, but as I've said it doesn't stop the plot from getting steadily more boring and predictable as it goes along. I now feel I was a little harsh on Shyamalan's last film The Village now, compared to this film that makes that film seem like a horror classic in comparison. For a film set around water, Shyamalan has simply shown what a terrible dry patch he is going through. *",Lady in the Water
38,MLDinTN,M. please go back to what you do best....,4,24 June 2007,"and make creepy, supernatural movies with a twist and some comedy thrown in. I'm so glad I did not pay to see this. This was even worse than the Village. Since I loved Signs, this movie is such a disappointment. It did have a few comedic moments, mainly with the fast talking Japense daughter and her mother and also the know it all movie reviewer. But, it still had nowhere near the laughs Signs had. The movie is a fairy tale, in which all the rules are made up as the film moves along. The idea of saving a narf just wasn't that interesting to me. The scrunts, the grass wolves, were the only cool things in this. Howard does not have the screen presence to be a lead role and is not entertaining. Maybe if a good actress had played the lead, it may have made for a better film. And why did her hair go from bright red to blond at the end of the film. Did the budget for hair dye run out?Night gives himself a much bigger role than previous films. I don't think that is a good thing. Mainly because, you know he is the director and it really distracts from believing his character.FINAL VERDICT: If you want to see how a good writer and director can really choose the wrong material and make a bad film, then check this out. But, if you don't want to ruin the greatness of Night for yourself, then skip this one. There is always his next film to look forward too.",Lady in the Water
39,tabuno,Decent Mythical Movie,7,22 January 2019,"24 July 2006. I'm not able to offer my best rating but I can say that Shyamalan reveals in this movie a sensitive ability to capture the mythical symbolism of the basic human condition. He continues to reach out with his movie towards more essential important and serious matters in his films. The small weaknesses, especially at the beginning with the overly cute animated explanation, the initial stereotypical characters, and the somewhat weak ending (although the seeming lack of the presence of Ron Howard's daughter (The Lady) close to the end of the movie was a bold stroke) reduced the overall significant impact of the movie. Yet, throughout, Shyamalan demonstrates his ability to both insinuate originality and great use of direction from his camera technique and his actors' performances. Most of all, the hidden, innermost, basic, emotions are capture in this movie. It's a moving, horror/mythical movie grown up without forgetting our inner child. Seven out of Ten Stars.",Lady in the Water
40,zkonedog,Absolutely CANNOT Be Judged Against Its M. Night Predecessors,9,10 March 2017,"When ""Lady In The Water"" first hit DVD/BluRay in December of 2006, I eagerly snatched it up in anticipation of M. Night Shyamalan's next masterpiece following ""The Village"". After viewing it at that time, I thought it was one of the worst movies I had ever seen in my life. Six years later, after watching the film again with a younger sibling, I finally was able to understand the overall concept and thoroughly enjoy the experience.For a basic plot summary, ""Lady In The Water"" takes place in ""The Cove"", an apartment complex (complete with swimming pool) owned by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). When a mermaid-like being named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) suddenly turns up in Heep's pool, an entirely new world (with completely new beings) is discovered, one that Story must get back to at all costs.If you try to compare ""Lady in the Water"" to M. Night's earlier fare, you will be severely disappointed. This is not a ""surprise ending"" film, nor is it a psychological thriller. Comparing it to movies like ""Signs"", ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", & ""The Village"" is like comparing apples to oranges. When I originally watched the film, I was expecting the past and missed what this movie really is all about.The real genius of this movie? It is essentially a modern-day fairy tale. Based on a bedtime story M. Night told his children that later took on epic proportions, Shyamalan adapted the story into a major motion picture. As such, the story is incredibly original and quite fantastical, filled with imaginative characters and quirky real-life individuals. This project is a labor of love for M. Night, and I respect him for making it and making it well.The only reason I can't give this film a full five stars is because some of the plot points do not exactly line up. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but it is quite a bit fractured at that. It contains nothing ""worthy"" of the multiple Razzy Awards it ended up winning, but a few points in the film are a bit confusing/nonsensical.Overall, upon second viewing (with a completely different frame of mind), ""Lady In The Water"" is inches shy of a truly classic film. Once you understand WHY M. Night made the movie, you'll respect it in a completely different light.",Lady in the Water

But even with the fussy, charismatic blob Giamatti as its lifeguard, ""Lady In The Water "" starts to feel as florid and spineless as a jellyfish.Heep bonds with Story, in a haze of shared sublimation. Her glowing gaze, or just sleeping near him, is escape from his custodial purgatory. The plot is a puzzle quest. Heep recruits other residents, who help him decipher Story's mission and protect her from ugly, grass-haired wolves called scrunts.",Lady in the Water

Loving spouse in tow, I was browsing the local vidout one evening when she who is my wife inquired of the aforementioned csr regarding the ""viewability"" of LADY IN THE WATER. I smiled knowingly, having seen said film during its theatrical run, and deferred to the young lady of whom the question had been asked. ""Don't bother,"" she said: ""It's not scary at all- and it's boring."" I did the proverbial double-take and, quickly recovering my composure, set the record straight in no uncertain terms: ""It's a great movie, dearest. Ignore this uncouth toadette and snag us a copy. You'll like it."" She did (and she did). It's not, as the clerkette pointed out, THE RING or THE GRUDGE... but, then, it was never (to my knowledge) touted as such.

43,johnnyboyz,"The most unrealistic, un-believable film ever made that's actually set in a realistic, believable location.",4,22 June 2007,"Having seen and really enjoyed The Sixth Sense; Shyamalan has made a film here that has had the exact opposite affect on me. Where The Sixth Sense was scary, this was forced; where The Sixth Sense was tragic, this was empty and where The Sixth Sense was clever, this was just plain dumb.The principal problem with Lady in the Water (technically she's not actually a lady  she's a 'sea nymph') is that there is just purely nothing at stake. If everything was to go tragically wrong and sea nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard ) died or suffered some other form of catastrophe; absolutely nothing in the world would change. Early on the film expects us to be scared in a very immature way  it expects us to be fearful of a bit of dark lighting and the odd foreboding 'will there be a jump moment or not' situation; later on, the film relies on its scares in the form of a wild animal of some sort  a cross between a werewolf (classic Horror monster villain) and a jackal. Needless to say, it backfires horribly.This film takes place in modern day America yet the basis for the story is an old fairy tale-come-bed time story that originates from the Native American's (something that was pointed out to me on further reading when they realised the drawings at the start were of that vein) but actually turns out to be a prayer of some sort from the Far East thanks to two helpful Chinese characters. I can tell you one thing: it's a damn good thing those two were around to help even if they should have been of the Native American origin.Apart from the film's hole ridden plot, there were several other things that popped up at numerous points that only added to the film's shockingly bad status. The fact that Story's innocence became very annoying after about ten minutes, the fact nearly everyone living in this apartment block the film is based around wanted to help yet Story (who's in great peril, remember) wouldn't tell them a thing and had them guessing the whole time  it makes you want to grab the sea nymph, shake her by the shoulders and demand: ""tell me how to help you or I'm going home and leaving you to die"" which is probably what would've happened.Along with this, we have those peculiar werewolf-come-jackal monsters lurking outside just doing absolutely nothing; except for maybe waiting for the last possible moment to attack. Truth is, the beasts could have waded in at any moment and fulfilled their mission in a matter of minutes  but they don't; they pointlessly bide their time. Most of the scenes as the 'tension' rises consist of a few characters entering a room; mumbling about absolute gobbledegook and then exiting having accomplished absolutely nothing what-so-ever. An example of this is where the main character and chief problem solver Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) gives a monologue about 'Narfs', 'Scrunts' and even throws in a 'Tartooic'  in fact, 'super Tartooics' and 'super Scrunts' are mentioned. Seeing and hearing really is disbelieving.The director himself: M. Night Shyamalan even has a role. He's a guy who just sits there in an ultra-voyeuristic way and just observes everything like he's the director behind the camera  in front of the camera. He must've been thinking: 'I can't believe these people fell for the script and are actually acting this out!' because it felt like it.I find it odd how even by the time the stupid conclusion arrives that there still remains something wrong with the film: everyone is using pitch forks and rakes and melee weapons to defend them selves against the beast when it finally attacks  this is America: gun capital of the world, remember? You're telling me no one in that apartment building even has a firearm? The situation the characters are faced with at the end is nothing a 12 gauge wouldn't sort out.So, as you've probably guessed  lousy script, lousy story and really; a lousy film. The cinematography and tragic, 'feel-sorry-for' character really well acted by Giamatti are two of the very, very few highlights.",Lady in the Water
44,filipemanuelneto,A touching story.,5,24 September 2015,"This fantasy film talks about the appearance of a sea nymph in the pool of an apartment complex where Cleveland is caretaker. The nymph, Story, will then change the lives of all residents, need to help them to fulfill her mission and return to her world. Directed by M. Night Shyamalan (who also is one of the leading roles), has Bryce Dallas Howard as the protagonist. M. Night Shyamalan has accustomed us to stories with a touch of fantasy and imagination. Its as if this remarkable filmmaker refused to grow and would like to make his films with the imagination of a child playing with a camera. And, in this movie, its pretty much what happens, having himself gone head to the front of them and ""playing"" with the story that he's creating (as he also wrote the script). But don't think that this movie is bad. It's a good movie has touching scenes and reaches the audience for our children's side, the child that we all have within us.

45,TheMovieDiorama,Lady In The Water dragged me down to its watery grave.,1,14 August 2018,"The start of the relentless downhill slope that is Shyamalan's career, this fantasy drama is murkier than polluted swamp water. What did I just witness? Seriously, I mean seriously! This isn't a film, it's a production that conveys his self-indulgence as he, not only writes, produces and directs this atrocity, but also plays a supporting role to which his character is a ""visionary whose writing changes the world"". That's not even the worst part! Right, so a superintendent of an apartment complex encounters a young girl in the swimming pool who he discovers to be a water nymph whose life is endangered by a beastly wolf creature. So, the residents assist in returning her to the ""Blue World"". How? Let me just clear my throat, get ready...! By seeking everyone's purpose in life so that the Symbolist can read cereal boxes to identify a Guild of seven sisters, discover the Healer and the true Guardian, so that a giant eagle can swoop in and ferry her back to the ""Blue World"" before she succumbs to the wounds from the Scrunt who avoids tree monkey peacekeepers known as the ""Tartutic"". What. The. Actual. Heck? I'm flabbergasted. Astonished. Shell shocked. Fantasy films are fantastic for evoking imagination and an underlying sense of creativity. But this is not the way to do it. It's not! Characterisation was weaker than diluted juice. The expositional narrative had fewer thrills than a tsunami. The acting, aside from Giamatti who just couldn't save the story from drowning, was more painful than accidentally getting shampoo in your eyes. Honestly, I was blinded by Shyamalan's acting. He actually thought he could act! The plot itself is nonsensical, not because it's an overwhelmingly fictitious story, but because it's undisputedly unfocused. It was as if Shyamalan was writing the story during the filming of the production. It's not metaphorical. It's not allegorical. It's a fractured fairytale that will leave anyone perplexed. Possibly one of the worst cinematic disasters I have witnessed. A damp fantasy flick that, when rinsed, drips drops of vapidity.",Lady in the Water
46,BaronBl00d,Some Middle Ground,5,20 January 2007,"In good faith and conscience I cannot say that Lady in the Water was a great film(possibly not even a good film) nor can I say it was a bad film. Its problems are legion: a plot that though wholly imaginative makes virtually no sense at all. Yes, it is easy to praise someone for coming up with this kind of creativity and story innovation, yet, the burden of making it real to the audience falls squarely on the shoulders of the director. M. Night Shyamalan does not succeed in making this film the audience's in terms of their(okay, I'll speak for myself here)my understanding. I found the plot to be so fragmented, disconnected, and unbelievable at times as to take everything that happened with little seriousness. As a viewer, especially in this kind of film, you want to be more connected with the subject matter. There were times; however, where I was brought in for moments, but they almost all came form the amazingly strong performance of Paul Giamatti, who I think is one of our more gifted actors on the rise. Giamatti convinced me of his sincerity despite the hokum going on around him. I liked Shyamalan's use of camera in many exteriors. He gets some convincing performances from new, untested talents, and even gives himself a much stronger role in the film than his usual cameo. There are aspects of the story that are very credible but the overall effect left me flat through some scenes - like the underwater scene with Giamatti, the scene with Giamtti going through the motion of his mundane existence, and just the wonderfully captured feeling of such a place used as the primary setting - were above-average. Bob Balaban has a neat, humorous role as a new tenant that is a tired, bored film critic. His scene in the hallway is my favourite. As for Bryce Dalls Howard - Ho hum.

For awhile, I felt like I'd missed part of the plot because things didn't fit together. I realized that I hadn't missed anything because I was following it just fine and seeing nothing I didn't understand. The reason I felt that way is because the plot is just really bad. The characters have zero reason to spend so much time on such a nonsensical purpose. I don't want to risk giving something away by explaining the ocean-wide holes in the plot, not to mention the utter stupidity of it.Shyamalan seems to think that since he's one of those directors whose name works as a magnet for audiences (even if no one I know pronounces it right, and really I don't see what's so hard about it), he can do no wrong and everyone's going to praise anything he defecates onto what can loosely be described as a screenplay. He throws in a cast of oddballs, and what I mean by that is a bunch of people who are weird for no reason. There is one character who exercises one side of his body into a muscular, toned beach body while leaving the other half skinny and weak. There's another character who sits in his apartment with a perpetual wide-eyed look and always acts as if the apocalypse is upon us, and in one scene he dramatically speaks with piercing inflection and fierce head-bobbing, which is supposed to be inventive and different. Really, it makes the character look like a complete idiot. All the computer-generated creatures induce so many exclaimed rhetorical questions that I can't even count them all.One thing I liked about the film was its cinematography. It's single-long-shot-themed style has a way of placing us in a clever voyeuristic point of view, as the camera always seems subtly misplaced. It's fantastic cinematography, I must say.Other than that one high point, the movie is ridiculous beyond belief. Did any of these actors joke and shake their heads during lunch when Shyamalan wasn't around? Are they too under the spell of this overconfident, self-indulgent, slowly diminishing auteur?

Night Shyamalan has always had a slightly aloof nature to his films that's never felt completely at home with its surroundings, but in the past he's been able to lean back on the immense ambiance of his premise and some great cinematography to compensate. Here, with neither of those skills showing their best, his odd idiosyncrasies are lain bare. Casting Bryce Dallas Howard as the titular lady was a smart choice, with her nymphian, otherworldly appearance giving the role a certain validity, but Paul Giamatti is merely okay as the weirdly comical stuttering maintenance man at the root of all the drama. The only other cast member worth mentioning is Shyamalan himself, who climbs into the role of the nonplussed creative genius, destined to indirectly shape and inspire a happy future. Take that for what you will. Lady in the Water has the echoes of a few good ideas reverberating through it, but they're never adequately reined in or solidified. Let's call it below average, and I think that's being pretty generous.",Lady in the Water
52,Chris_Docker,A fairy-tale for adults and older children,8,8 August 2006,"Do you like bedtime stories? If you maybe think back to the time when you were a child, when you were read stories of strange creatures, of wonders beyond this world . . . Children's stories are usually a bit silly but, at the time, they are supremely exciting. As we get older, we maybe lose some of our capacity to believe spontaneously.M. Night Shyamalan brings us a movie that makes it equally easy to be derisive or awe-struck: My inclination was to be derisive as the advertised storyline seemed laughable, but I ended up being quite impressed (rather, you might say, the way gullible Startrek and other geek-series fans are, so do be warned: you may be less than stunned), but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I jumped out of my seat in all the right places, let my mind race with mesmerising symbols, gasped at the freshly created mythology, and was grateful that a film did all that without heavy reliance on special effects. Lady in the Water is a modern fantasy with a generous touch of horror. It tells of a doctor who has lost faith in himself, and has an ordinary job as a sort of handyman in an apartment complex called the Cove. His repressed emotions come out as he tries to protect a strange sea nymph, or 'narf' called Story, as at the same time he is frightened by the nasty piece of lycanthropy, a 'scrunt,' that's after her. He and those around him draw inspiration and learn about themselves as they are pulled in to defend Story against the monstrous evil that is trying to drag her down.Hopefully those first two paragraphs will have put you off if this movie is Not For You. An analysis of the tale, the film-making and mythology that follows is for anyone who's left. Lady in the Water is maybe too much on the scary side for small children, otherwise it is a fairytale for grown ups and older youngsters alike and offers excellent all-round entertainment. Paul Giamatti shines as the doctor turned building superintendent (Cleveland Heep), Bryce Dallas Howard impresses with other-worldly charm as the mysterious narf, and an ensemble supporting cast keeps us interested from several different angles, from Hispanics with five daughters, a crossword puzzle addict, to a film critic who hasn't got anything good to say about daft romances where people like to get wet. Shyamalan, apart from writing and directing, also plays a writer with writer's block, then there's a oddball muscleman who only exercises one side of his body, a roomful of cigarette smokers, and a lady who attracts butterflies.Our narf (who appears from the apartment's swimming pool and disturbs Cleveland's humdrum existence) lives in the passageways beneath the water. The scrunt is a vicious creature that looks like a wolf covered in grass and that can make itself flat and all but invisible. As Cleveland and the other tenants try to solve the riddles that will allow Story to return to her own world, the narf's powers of perception reveal their destinies. Cleveland has an intense stutter that gives Giamatti plenty of time to shape his lines for maximum impact. It miraculously disappears when Story is around (she has that effect on people) and those affected by her presence get pins and needles on the inside. Story's powers of inspiration are destined to have a profound effect on one of the tenants that will shape the world, but who is it? Until her mission is achieved, she cannot think of returning. Our panoply of weird and wonderful characters find ways of relating until the parts they need to play are revealed.The mythology of narfs, scrunts, guardians of divine law and a celestial eagle, is discovered in bits and dabs through an old woman who speaks no English (when she was explaining, and her daughter translating over the top, some concentration is needed to follow as the two voices overlap and I found this added to the sense of mystery). The old woman is irritated at the constant questions and, to win her trust, Cleveland has to be more childlike - just as is required of the audience, becoming more open to suggestion as we suspend disbelief. Without that, you will not shriek with terror (as I did, quite literally) when the beast appears, or thrill with the wonder of Story's mission, or rejoice in the greatness of mankind hidden beneath the earthly dross.Shyamalan not only uses excellent psychology in building the myth behind his story, but combines the necessary ingredients for original myth out of - he claims - a simple bedtime story he wrote for his children. The central character, Story, (her name an obvious pun) is a catalyst for the growth of the other personalities. The bogey-man element is supplied by the scrunt, who might be seen by fans as the materialism that endangers the inspiration the narf provides. Or the characters could even be aspects of Cleveland and inside his head. It doesn't matter really as it's not a whodunit - if the film inspires you, you might pick your own set of answers and, if it doesn't, you presumably won't care.Some will see Lady in the Water as a monument to the scriptwriter's ego and sense of self-gratification, especially when we see the role set out for the character he also plays: but such charges would only be sustainable if the end result was invalid (and I have yet to see the symbolism faulted, even if some people don't like the film.) Lady in the Water is a crisp, professionally made fairy tale that you avoid enjoying at your peril. Stories are good for children, offering them important lessons about values; and for those adults who no longer want to fly on the wings of their imagination, we can only be sad that they have lost the spirit they once had.",Lady in the Water

54,drystyx,What is wrong with this picture?,4,29 August 2016,"""Sham"" usually has a truer understanding of characters than shown here. THE VILLAGE, for example, shows many sides of many stories.Here, we get ""fake"" characters in a story of humans interacting with supernatural creatures.This could have been worse, but it should have been much better.It isn't classified under ""comedy"", but we get a one dimensional comic aspect here.It's okay that Sham pokes fun at inner city snobs totally outclassed in a real world with real problems. They are all wrapped up in their inner city fantasy that makes them accept the supernatural, but only on their own terms.The characters, on the surface, seem credible. However, we get a ""point of view"" mob mentality from off stage that makes us know this is on stage.Take some of the more famous ""point of view"" movies: Breakfast Club, MASH, and Southern Comfort.""Breakfast Club"" is totally wrapped up in the view point of an obvious narrator who turns the other characters into stereotypes. She makes her hero the tallest and most super human and most self righteous of characters, and herself the plain Jane who gets the hero at the end, meanwhile abasing every other character as caricatures with no dignity.MASH is a story told fairly true to the book, an effort to give credibility to a story by making the setting realistic. However, we're supposed to believe mob mentality is justifiable, and that one weak person bullies dozens of ""tougher people"". Unfortunately, this only fools the most feeble of minds, and is heralded by real bullies with mob mentality. It not only is stupid, but it is dangerous, because the fact is that those who made it and loved it didn't do so in order to be fair and just, but to give an illusion that they could hand pick one person easy to lynch for a lynch mob to rationalize abusing. And that is exactly what happened during the seventies and later.SOUTHERN COMFORT was a more subtle point of view story. At least the ""bullies"" weren't a minority of one against many. Here, we got a tainted point of view from the two survivors, but it was very subtle. Had two other characters survived, the story of ""point of view"" would be totally different.This movie went into MASH territory, as we get a demonetization of one character, a Frank Burns throw away character who couldn't possibly exist, and is defined as such a person only in order to allow real bullies to claim the one they hate deserves to be hated as a bully. The undeniable fact is that in the History of the Universe, no one weak, ineffective person has ever been a bully over dozens of strong, effective people. Can't happen.That's where this story not only becomes ""fake"", but ""sick"" and ""dangerous"" in the divisive way that MASH became so. Oh, it's nice to think the one your clique cheats and destroys is corrupt and arrogant, but the fact is that if we are in a clique that does this, we are just rationalizing demonic behavior identical to the Nazis of Hitler.Too bad, because some of the other characters could have been credible if not for this self righteousness. It is totally out of character for the Sham, and have to wonder if the Sham had issues with an individual just before and during the shooting of the movie.That aside, there was still an arrogance and self righteousness about the script that alienated people, yet at the same time did somewhat seem to say that ""yep, a country boy can survive, and these city slickers are feeble"", just way too much to not be comical.",Lady in the Water

57,ferbs54,Slight And Inconsequential,5,26 April 2017,"I recently watched my fourth M. Night Shyamalan movie, following ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable"" and ""The Village."" The film in question was ""Lady in the Water,"" and it would seem that I have gone to the well once too often, as I did not care for this one nearly as much as those other very fine ones just mentioned. In this 2006 offering, Paul Giamatti stars as a building manager named Cleveland, who finds, in his building's swimming pool, a very odd young woman named Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron, who had just starred in ""The Village""). As it turns out, Story is a water nymph of sorts, a so-called ""narf,"" who has come to us from her world to give advice to mankind. This advice takes the form of encouraging a budding young author in the building, played by producer/writer/director Shyamalan himself, regarding a book that he is writing that will someday inspire a future U.S. president. Or something like that. Story's mission is made more difficult by the hairy green wolflike creature that has been sent to eat her. Or something like that. Anyway, despite the fact that the film looks great, and despite the typically fine acting by the two leads and the fine supporting work by Bob Balaban and Mary Beth Hurt, this film is something of a mess, mainly because of the preposterous story line that just grows increasingly loopy as things proceed. Fortunately, much of the film is played for winking laffs, but the entire conceit, by the time that things wrap, just feels so slight and inconsequential that I really couldn't buy into it or much care. At one point, one of the kids in the building is reading the future by looking at cereal boxes and one of the other building residents is predicting events by doing his crossword puzzle, all leading to a ""WTF?"" reaction from the befuddled viewer. It would seem that Shyamalan created this film as a fairy tale of sorts for his kids at home, and I hope that they enjoyed this one more than I did. In all, not a bad picture, per se, but surely a misfire and a weaker effort from this interesting filmmaker. I hope for better things when I watch my next Shyamalan film, ""The Visit,"" in a day or two....",Lady in the Water
58,aidanratesmovies,"Underrated, but hardly as great as Shamalayan's other flicks",6,31 July 2021,"At times a bit mediocre, and quite messy, Lady in the Water eventually was able to win me over due to its creative world building and it's clever amount and use of heart. I'll start with the flaws of the film. From the start it has a bit of a basic feel to it, and can be a bit predictable at times. It can be formulaic and a bit childish (as one would expect from this 'bedtime story') but it also seems to rush and linger on certain plot points that otherwise could have been handled better by a steadier hand. The acting is rather decent, Paul Giamatti is utterly charming in the leading role and Bryce Dallas Howard shines as she did with Shamalayan other flick The Village. The look of the film is nothing special, but the use of the films set design (an entire apartment building) is rather impressive, and the CGI contains some interesting creature designs you certainly haven't seen before and won't be seeing again. The pacing can be a bit slow at times, but nothing too bad. It's not terribly entertaining, but it can be rather interesting. By far the worst part of the flick is the forced film critic character, who is as about as much a stereotype as you would expect, and quite tedious to watch at times. In the end, Lady in the Water is a bit too familiar at times for its own good, but it does manage to be a solid idea and fun definitely for younger teens to enjoy.My Rating: 5.6/10.",Lady in the Water

This clever idea was clever for a while, then he built and built upon it and made it just stupid. This film was so caught up in itself it was annoying. It made little sense. Shyamalan's style of direction kind of annoys me too. He has it always very quiet, even during conversations. And the film tried to be funny, but I found it corny.

Unfortunately having an actress play a catatonic and boring supernatural being doesn't make anyone else feel anything but somnolence. The film should be repackaged and sent to late night infomercial hell as the ultimate cure for insomnia.The film is absolutely nonsensical and as aimless in its design. Having not a man act as a demented soul but a whole community of people who not only support his delusions but apparently have been inhaling the fumes coming out from that pool. If you think things have gotten bad at this point, wait until you see the laughable and quite disheveled beast that the writer/director/producer came up with. It makes you want to call either the Animal Control Department or a whole army of demented hairdressers. The only scary thing about this creature is its bad hairdo, though it does seem to have some strong lungs! It seems unbelievable that this is the same man behind ""Signs"" and ""The Sixth Sens"".

61,ShootingShark,"Strange, Engrossing Fantasy Of Apartment Block Caught Up In A Bedtime Story",7,14 June 2009,"Cleveland Heep is a building supervisor who thinks someone is swimming after hours in the pool. He finds the culprit, who turns out to be a sea nymph called Story on a mission to inspire mankind to nobler things. But Story is being chased by a Scrunt, a monster bent on her destruction. Can Cleveland protect her, with only his trusty tool belt to rely on ?This is an ambitious, scary, intriguing, beautifully oddball movie. It's set in a completely ordinary environment, but then gradually transforms itself into an entire mythology of other worlds, beasts and prophecies. It does this so gently, adding layer upon layer to the fantasy as Cleveland gradually deciphers the mystery, that every turn brings in some new and wacky characters and adds to the fun. Giamatti is wonderful in the lead, as unlikely a Sir Lancelot defender as they come, but he is lovable, noble, sad and good natured all at the same time, and the the entire support cast are a terrific bunch of weirdos, including the director as the portentous writer. I love the way Shyamalan has very little regard for conventional character structure - he populates his stories with the people he needs, never handsome Joe Cool types with unnecessary love interests. In this story the building is full of surprises, both literally and in terms of the people who live there and the horror/fantasy mix is terrific, kind of The Tenant meets The Secret Of Roan Inish, if that's possible. The Scrunt is a fantastic monster, barely glimpsed and subtly horrifying, particularly in a hair-curling scene where Cleveland attempts to confront it. Best of all is James Newton Howard's ethereal score, which somehow transforms a suburban apartment block into a fairy tale universe, simply by using choir and strings. This is a tremendous, rather unique movie, which got a critical drubbing from the sort of people who don't understand that fun, imagination and originality, and not realism, are the crucial elements of cinema, and always have been. Shyamalan gets his revenge on these hacks by making one of the characters a critic, who's incapable of grasping what's happening and meets an amusingly sticky end. Ignore the detractors however; this is a great fantasy, made with tender loving care and filled with charming scenes. Check it out.",Lady in the Water

65,raulfaust,"What's the story, morning glory?",4,20 August 2014,"""Lady in the Water"" is a controversial film that has been loved by many and hated by many others, so I decided watching it last night in order to see what's going on. First off, I'll say it all of a sudden: it's bad. But let me explain this better. M. Night Shyamalan is a great director in here-- as he is in all of his works--, delivering some beautiful scenes, helped by an incredible scenario. Acting is very professional, and it's very clear to me that the actors were really disciplined, expressing the emotions Shyamalan wanted them to. Shyamalan himself acts pretty well. However, what turns this movie into a never ending boredom is the wrecked story; it doesn't feel plausible, interesting or anything good. In fact, the story feels over-the-top for most of the time, especially considering how easily the human characters believed in the situation. I mean, ordinary people wouldn't EVER buy such bedtime story and such happenings. Another bad aspect is that this movie didn't make the most of Bryce Dallas Howard; she was SO GREAT in ""The Village"", whereas her character in here is so... Boring! Or lifeless? Maybe both. I honestly didn't make it to the end, considering I wasn't any entertained with this flick, albeit it was directed by one of my favorite directors. 2014 and 2015 are gonna be greater years for Shyamalan, I hope.",Lady in the Water
66,Rob_Taylor,Earth to M Night....what the f**k!.....over....,4,6 August 2006,"Let's face it. You either love or hate M Night. A couple of good films, followed by a raft of stinkers have proved he's not going to be the next Lucas or Spielberg. Yet still he tries, you have to admire him for that. Rather like his European contemporary, Uwe Boll, he blithely ignores any and all criticism and continues doing what he does best - making bad films.Of course, with dear old Uwe, you have the feeling that he actually knows his movies are sub-par and doesn't care. With M Night, though, there is a growing certainty that he believes that he is right and everyone else is wrong.And so we come to his latest film. LitW is apparently based on an ad-hoc story he told his kids at bedtime. The plot, at its most basic, sees the valiant attempts of a bunch of misfits to return a trapped Narf (sorta sea-nymph thingy) to her own world. The backstory which is kinda ridiculous (but then it is based on a bedtime story) has the Narf deposited in our world to learn, or make contact, or somesuch silliness in order to bring the two worlds closer.Now, I don't mind the simplistic story too much. Some stories don't need to be complex in order to entertain. But this is where LitW begins to fail. The story is simple, so there has to be something else to the movie to fill the gap. Usually this is action, character development or mystery etc.. But there really isn't any great action to speak of in the entire film and the character development is, like the plot, childish. The characters are introduced one-by-one and are so totally charmless and one-dimensional that cardboard cut-outs with their story focus written on in marker pen would have done as well. Likewise the ""mystery"", as with all his latest movies, is painfully apparent and obvious and anyone who watches the first few minutes will probably be able to plot out the rest of the film with great accuracy, scene by scene.The ""Guild"" (a kind of super-adventure club for stranded nymphs) is developed so badly that its almost an insult. Some members are barely even given a point to their existence as members, let alone given adequate screen time.Giamatti seems to have a knack lately for picking dreary films, but even I was impressed by the fact that his character here - an innocuous ex-doctor hiding away from the world - is seemingly able to hold his breath for over two minutes. He does this whilst exploring the nymph's underwater hovel at the bottom of the apartment complex swimming pool. People can do that, of course, but there wasn't even any sign that he was in trouble despite his exertions. It was like he did that every day.Other scenes involve the laughable ""Guild"" and the ludicrous ease with which everyone believes the nymph's story and muck's in to help. The sole menace of the piece are the Astro-turf dogs that are trying to kill the nymph. But they get scant time and even the showdown at the end is rather dull and unexciting.Of course, this is an M Night movie, so there has to be a twist. Here it's a rather simple one (yes, I know, all his twists are, but this is even more predictable than usual) in that certain members of the Guild are not given their correct places in the scheme of things. Direly obvious from the moment we are introduced to the Guild concept.One can't really look at this film and think that it was anything other than a big joke concocted by M Night to tempt critics to pour scorn upon it - certainly I can't honestly believe anyone would make this movie and put in the characters M Night does. The inclusion of the film critic - who meets a grisly end whilst recounting how story lines ""normally"" progress, is a deliberate poke at Night's own critics. And as for M Night's own role in the cast, as a misunderstood writer whose work is ""destined to be misunderstood until after his death"" and who will help shape the future - give me a f**king break! If Night intended this all as a big parody of the story-making and movie process, combined with a non-subtle dig at his critics and throwing in a bit of self-reverential self-mockery at the same time, then I would clap delightedly and my regard for the man would improve immeasurably.But, and this is the big but...I just don't believe it. Whilst the ""you can't be serious.."" side of me wants to believe this was all a vast joke, the more analytical and cynical side of me sees nothing in this movie but Night's big fat ego. He is right, everyone else is wrong. End of story.This kind of conceit, whilst making Night happy that he is ""following his own vision"", won't get him very far. If nothing else, it has only served to alienate himself further with the critics.",Lady in the Water

A group of humans with special powers must be gathered in order to protect her and help her get back to where she belongs.  This isn't exactly the kind of movie you'd expect from M. Knight. I remember that the first time I saw it, I was very surprised by how dissimilar it was to all the movies that he had done before. Lady in the Water truly is best viewed as a modern day bedtime story. It's easy to believe that Shyamalan made this movie for his kids to enjoy, and other kids, as well. I also believe that this is one of the most self-indulgent and masturbatory movies that I've ever seen in my life. Even in Hollywood, this level of narcissism in a film is remarkable. If Shyamalan could have reigned in some of his frustrations at critics and his own sense of self-importance, this could have been a good movie.

Cleveland will help Story to find who is the human in question and also rallies his tenants to help protect her from the scrunt, a strong and evil creature that try to kill any narf that wants to return to her world.I think it is awesome to think that the plot of this movie is based on a bedtime story that M. Night Shyamalan wrote and created for his kids. When the movie finished, I was so convinced that a tale like that already existed, that I went to search for the word ''narf'' in Google to be sure of it. The movie has beautiful lessons as well, like how humans are all connected and our union is important, as well as how important is to believe in yourself,not matter how clumsy you are.But I also have a critic to make: I hated the way the all the characters accepted Story as a supernatural being, without any hesitation or surprise.

Be advised though - I'm no fruitcake.I DON'T believe in screwing a client for a few extra bucks, selling the car for two grand more than its worth, driving around trying to save a few cents a litre on a tankful of gas. I can live without the Dow Jones index, flash jewelry, new age thinking and latte coffee! I can't live without magic.LADY IN THE WATER is magic - for the fortunate few that can see it. Unless you are fully able to suspend belief and simply let the fantasy embrace you - you are totally wasting your time with this movie. You think Shyamalan cares? he doesn't! He has a depth of awareness few possess. He made this film because he COULD, not because he's desperate for cinematic recognition.Whilst preposterous in concept - it is still at its heart, a tale of hope and belief. Belief in yourself, belief that life has a purpose that as yet you have not discovered. Story is our own conscience. We all have the Healer, the Interpreter, the Guardian....even the eagle, inside of us.Giamatti is not far short of awesome here. A wonderful portrayal of a stuttering man with a devastated past who asks nothing from life yet gives of himself freely. Again one cannot overlook Shyamalan's unequalled ability to fashion rich and interesting characters out of the meek, the oppressed and the emotionally underdeveloped. He himself plays a key role in this film and his talent in front of the camera should not be under-rated.There is so much to watch and listen to here - IF you are of a mind to. If you prefer, follow the crowd - sit there and see nothing but a slow moving film with seemingly no purpose and childlike intentions. Laugh at the dialog, the funny green hyena, Bryce Dallas Howard's make-up.On the other hand, if you see beauty in snow flakes, red ochre sunsets and a child's smile...odds are, the last ten minutes of this film will make you cry!",Lady in the Water
72,MartianOctocretr5,"Thoughtful and creative, but not for everyone",7,23 July 2006,"M. Night Shyalaman breaks from his usual style, and delivers a unique fantasy story that is surprisingly involving.To enjoy this movie, you have to lend an enormous amount of the suspension of disbelief; if you go in with a pick-it-apart attitude, you will despise it and think it's the most infantile story you've seen. The plot, is, after all, based on a bedtime story. The characters and the legends that are described were all fabricated by the writer, and will sound silly at first. Go with it, and the writer has found clever and humorous ways to introduce you into the make-believe world of Story, and her adventure in the ""real world.""The movie is certainly not sophisticated in any way, nor does it even try to be. It's a fairy-tale, and pokes jabs at itself which constantly remind you of this fact. These in-jokes might even be said to be overdone; one character even addresses the audience (breaking the so-called ""4th wall""), and it's distracting and unnecessary.Paul Giamatti is convincing and approaches his mission to help the winsome Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) with urgency. He has a heartfelt long speech in the film which is very touching and emotional. Howard speaks infrequently, but her facial expressions convey her benevolence and vulnerability well. Her performance is sympathetic, and you find yourself caring about the fate of this imaginary creature.Yes, there are a few flaws. One human character swims underwater longer than the people in ""Poseidon"" without drowning (and the Poseidon characters broke the world record by about an hour); just one example of where your suspension of disbelief is tested. Stereotypes are glaring. Also, the ending is somewhat predictable, after the legend is outlined for the audience.If you don't like the fantasy genre, you won't like this. If you're looking for continuous action, look elsewhere. But for an easy going, optimistic story about people reaching out to help one another, this bedtime story will be a pleasant watch.",Lady in the Water

74,Screen_Blitz,"Lady in The Water is most certainly not the fantasy spectacle we deserve. It is too plodding, too inept, and overtly unconvincing",3,3 September 2017,"What M. Night Shyalaman proved when he directed 'The Sixth Sense','Unbreakable', and 'Signs' is that he is the filmmaker with potential. For a while, it seems like Shyalaman was another promising filmmaker in the Hollywood roster. This makes it more disconcerting to see him descending so low with this plodding supernatural thriller. This fantasy spectacle following the story that echoes the works of classic fairy tales falls short of the magic that made Shyalaman's aforementioned hits. Worse, the director also manages to appear in front of the camera as a supporting character, a role that suggests he may not have as bright of a future in front of the camera as he does behind. If there are any redeeming values to be handed in its 110-minute runtime, they are all pretty much diminished by the Shyalaman's failure to bring is mythical world to life and establish it with a coherent story. The film, set in the director's hometown in Philadelphia like the rest of his entries, follows Cleveland Heep (played by Paul Giamatti), an apartment building superintendent who is alarmed by strange noises going on in the swimming pool. Splashing around in the pool is a mysterious red-head woman known as a ""narf"" named Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard) who has emerged from a magical world known as ""The Blue World"". She reveals to be a character from a storybook. As she and Cleveland develop a platonic relationship of some sort, she is soon haunted by mysterious creatures who threaten to keep her returning home to her world. It is up to Cleveland and his apartment friends Dr. Dury (played by Jeffrey Wright), Vick (played by M. Night Shyalaman himself), Ann (played by Sarita Choudhury), and other nameless residents to protect her and get her home.M. Night Shyalaman has proved capable of generating palpable suspense when showcasing the tension of each moment. This film, however, does virtually nothing to show it, though you should definitely give him some points for imagination. Shyalaman establishes world in which reality and fantasy clash, with something push the imagination. But it is difficult to grow engaged in this fantastical world when the director fails to make things convincing. It is all just a series of botched attempts at providing solid thrills while moments of suspense that are even remotely effective run scarce. And when you are dealing with the story that is so incoherent it easy to find yourself lost more than once, it only adds insult to injury. Arguably the best attempt at scares is the scene where Cleveland is approached by a ferocious wolf-like creature. Sadly, that sequence only half works. There is one interesting element involving romantic tension between Cleveland and Story, even that feels dull. Their chemistry certainly doesn't sizzle. As for Paul Giamatti, he does a fair job in the role of the lead character, generating a little humor with his occasional stuttering. Bryce Dallas Howard is fine, but nothing that will leave a lasting impression. On the other hand, M. Night Shyalaman, who makes an appearance as an egotistical writer is a little wooden in his role. It is probably in his best interest if he is just sticks with directing, although he has made a few cameos in the past. Lady in The Water is a dull fantasy spectacle that fall shallow of the flair that M. Night Shyalaman's upheld in his previous efforts. It comes to show that even the most promising directors hit the low points. Although the film isn't exactly a deploring disaster, it most certainly shows the worst of the director.",Lady in the Water
75,dunmore_ego,Part Real. Part Fable. All Night.,8,16 September 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan's *Lady in the Water* is truly what it sells itself as  a bedtime story; make-believe of the highest order, taken with a generous pinch of sandman salt and a mountainous suspension of disbelief.Artfully woven, beautifully shot and accidentally involving, this movie solidifies writer-director-actor Shyamalan as a tale-telling talent akin to Stephen King, a director rivaling the eye of Spielberg - and an actor only slightly better than Keanu Reeves.Yet, redemption. Regarding his thespianic dabblings, I've got two words for Night's naysayers: Darth Vader. Though he is far from usurping the thrones of Oldman or Ford, Night need only display *two* emotions on screen to put him miles above the Christensens and Cruises - and he pulls off his emotionally-draining role in *Lady* quite commendably.Up against Paul Giamatti, he has to. As Night is the new breed of fantasist, turning Hollywood's formulaic swill in on itself, so too is Giamatti  through sheer talent  redefining the new breed of leading man. In *Lady*, Giamatti mines his well-known, put-upon Everyman character, yet taps into acting territory reserved for the De Niros, Hoffmans and Day-Lewises. Playing a lonely, stuttering caretaker  and making it look as painful as it must really be (a stutterer AND a caretaker) - he turns in a gutsy performance that makes all his awards for *Sideways* and *Cinderella Man* sit that much more securely on his shelf.Giamatti is Cleveland Heep, caretaker of an apartment complex called The Cove, which has raised the condition of Nothing Ever Happening to an art form. Into this lusterless community, up through the swimming pool, comes Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of director Ron), one of an ancient race of Sea People, called a narf (which translates as ""great legs, but a face like Richie Cunningham""), whom Cleveland keeps finding naked in his shower, quickly buying her tale of being sent to mystically jog the inspiration of surface people (the nakedness only helps).The narf legends are intermittently revealed through one of the Cove residents: apparently, Story must gather together a group of prophesied icons such as The Guild, The Healer, The Wordsmith - but lands a coterie of Batman villains instead, in the form of The Whiner (Giamatti), The Puzzler (Jeffrey Wright) and The Stoners (a bunch of surfer dudes).Even as a patch of Big Bad Astroturf stalks her  all the better to scrunt you with, my dear!  Story, with Cleveland's unintentionally-comedic help, discovers The Writer (who is actually  wink wink - The Director) whom her presence inspires to complete a magnum opus which will ""change the world."" By casting himself as The Writer, Night brings down the wrath from all walks of entertainment wannabes (critics, directors and writers alike), who begrudge Night this indulgence of Ego and frankly, I'm getting sick of the hypocrisy  who gets anything done *without* Ego?! It's all ABOUT Ego. As Gene Simmons so astutely sneers, ""You wish you were me."" Try looking on the bright side of Night's humble, Homeric character  it may be the only time we'll ever hear him say he is ""nothing special."" *Lady* works effectively as long as we believe that Cleveland believes wholeheartedly in Story's veracity - but convincing one lonely, balding man you're a magical sprite can't be that hard with legs like those; we are distracted minimally when *everyone* buys into the fairy tale as readily as Cleveland. The Night sleight-of-hand is employed just when we feel secure with the story's predictability - what we thought was a plan coming together was merely misdirection. We recall Night's notoriously subtle foreshadowing - how he merely pencils in, rather than hammers home - and realize that he has once again concealed his mystery in full sight.The failing of the movie is in its less-than-compelling climax, for even when the plan DOES come together, we ask ourselves what exactly came together.Yet again  redemption: the stirring and stunning music of James Newton Howard dynamically spirits us into this world of twigs shaped like wolves and mermaids shaped like Twiggy, salving the wounds of weak plot; Giamatti provides a surprising amount of humor amongst the suspense, at times, overlapping the sublime and ridiculous; Night's film-making itself is a wonder to behold, with his penchant for making every frame count, his creative camera placements and artful use of out-of-focus shots.*Lady* even gives us a self-referential movie critic (Bob Balaban, whom some critics take as seriously as he satires them), who didactically elucidates ""movie formula,"" specifically so that Night can show us how *Lady* ingeniously subverts that formula As much as he is lauded by film *aficionados* and fans alike, an unsophisticated coterie obsessively maintains that unless an M. Night Shyamalan film contains a ""twist"" exactly like that in *The Sixth Sense*, it is worthless. Who made up *that* rule? Writing, acting, music, sound design, ingenious plot arcs matter not to these bent-parochial netherworlders. Either they need to get over their stone-stupid provincialism, or they need to get laid.Maybe one of the most poignant messages of *Lady in the Water* is that even the insignificant among us may have a significant role to play on some grander canvas. Unfortunately, only the ""significant"" will glean that message. While those who pule for twists and horror and moronically await *Sixth Sense Part II: The Seventh Sense*, or *Sixth Sense III: Ocean's Fifteen* should take my advice and get themselves a massage.And  like this movie  include a happy ending.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Lady in the Water
76,xredgarnetx,Ummmm...,5,15 December 2006,"One thing is for sure: LADY is not a horror movie, as marketed at the time of its theatrical release. It is a clunky fairy tale, with the plot loudly spelled out by various characters throughout the movie, mainly by a stuttering apartment super played by the woebegone Paul Giamatti (has there ever been a less appealing lead actor?). I suspect M. Night took his inspiration from THE PRINCESS BRIDE in this badly rendered tale of a strange woman rising from a swimming pool who may or may not be a fairy from another dimension. Ron Howard's daughter plays the strange woman, and appears constantly on the verge of death. A less appealing female lead I have rarely seen. Anyway, it is up to Giamatti to save her and return her to her own world. To do so, he must do battle with a shape-shifting wolf sent to hunt down and kill the fairy lady. And he ends up enlisting the aid of various tenants, a colorful group of misfits, to return the girl to her own world. Nothing in this film works. We don't buy the fairy tale, the girl, the apartment dwellers, not even the story's internal logic. We kept asking ourselves, why not just take the sickly woman to a hospital? For a change, considering his previous films, M. Night tries for some humor, and occasionally succeeds. But it is for naught.

For a split second I suddenly wondered if getting satellite TV was a good idea if all the movies would turn out to be this bad! The acting is inexplicable, the script is utterly dreadful. It seemed that for 2 hours the only thing we saw were these sketchy characters talking nonsense between four walls. The cinematography was non-existent. I've never seen such bad composition, lighting and editing for a ""major"" film.The film was as exciting as a smelly wet old sponge that's been mildewing for years. This ""film"" wants to be seen as some sort free thinking, new-agey hippy kind of way but simply comes across as a failed experiment from someone with a large ego, ie: the director. Just awful!",Lady in the Water
78,baumer,This can't be the same man that made the Sixth Sense!,1,2 May 2007,"The Sixth Sense was too good to be true. Here was a terrifying horror film directed with a Hitchcockian touch. It was the brainchild of a new director who shocked the industry with his touch. His follow up, Unbreakable, was just as good. M. Night Shyamalan was here to stay.Here we are not even 10 years later and M. Night has given us what he calls a bedtime story. His ego has now gotten bigger than even Taratino's, and that is hard to do. In this latest head swell, Shyamalan, who was told by a studio head that this was a bad idea, ignored them and went crying to Warner Brothers to let him make his movie. Someone there gave the green light hoping that the Village was just a blip. As it turns out, it wasn't.Lady in the Water is one of the most ridiculous, convoluted, insulting messes I have ever seen. The story revolves around metaphors and cryptic ideas that only Shyamalan understands. Here is my interpretation to the best of my ability.The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in some tragic accident. Since then he has lost himself and now flounders in anonymity in his apartment complex. He, as the superintendent, notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title.You see, M. Night created an entire ""Bed Time Story"" about how land people used to coexist with the people of the ""Blue World"" (the ocean). These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure, like water, as the Super points out. To assist the greedy people, massive birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land in Wonder Woman's Invisible Jet (okay i made that part up, but it is just as logical as anything else in here) and they have to show the land people how to be nice again. They must also confront the chosen one because he is after all the Chosen One. Why he is chosen and what he does is not really clear, but then again, logic and clarity are not really all that prominent in this film.The Chosen One is, of course, M. Night himself. He will soon be able to walk on water and raise the dead.Continuing, there are wolves that aren't wolves. They are really Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them, they blend into the grass, so the next time you are near water, and there is grass there, feel around for a wolf that isn't a wolf and you might find a scant. And don't forget about the rules.The night the Snarf (lady of the blue world) returns to the blue world, they cannot attack them. If they do, these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. I think grass is quite prevalent in this film because it must have been what Night was smoking at the time he wrote this and it must have been what the execs at Warner Brothers were smoking when they green lit this.There is more about the scants. Normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either, unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is. I'm not making this stuff up. Try watching it and see if I'm lying.So now the good guy, Cleveland, played by Paul Giamatti, must find people to help him. You see, there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer, the Guardian, the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can or else it wont work or something. You see these rules are very specific. There is also some old Korean lady who just happens to know this fairy tale and she explains it to her Korean daughter who tells Cleveland that to hear the whole story, he must lay on the couch and behave like a baby. Then the helpers have to get clues from cereal boxes to help out the Lady. This all make sense to Night somehow. To the rest of us, not so much.And the moral is that no one knows who they are....I think. Except for M. Night. He thinks he is God (Chosen One).This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. I don't really think he tried to direct a coherent film. I don't even think he tried to write one. This is something that only M. Night gets and comprehends, and that is only because many of the characters are made of grass. To illustrate this point, here is another example of the idiocy of the film. Cleveland wakes up to find a half naked wet woman on his couch. Instead of freaking out and yelling, ""Who the hell are you and how did you get in my house and why do you look like Daryl Hannah from Splash?"", he simply begins to listen to her story and then tells everyone else the story and they all believe him as well. Not once does any character walk away thinking he should be in a straight jacket. They all just drink the kool-aid and then look for snarfs and grassy wolves.Overview: This movie is in my top 25 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was, but never laughed at the so-called 'funny parts.' Do not see this movie unless you need a cure for insomnia.Final grade: .5/10.....only for Giamatti's performance.",Lady in the Water
79,jaredmobarak,Man has forgotten how to listen,9,22 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan has really matured as a filmmaker the past few years. After an auspicious beginning with the much-adored Sixth Sense, he followed with a slow, poorly paced Unbreakable and the not quite sure what it wanted to be Signs. At this point I pretty much wrote him off, except for the brilliance in marketing that seems to make his trailers must sees. I grudgingly went to The Village in 2004 and to my surprise loved it. Everything that didn't work in his previous two films was corrected almost as though he needed those slips to hone his timing and writing. The Village was a masterpiece in my opinion, a touching love story; not only between the young lovers, but also the band of old friends who chose a lifestyle to free their children from the harsh reality of the real world. Which Shyamalan would we get with the new Lady in the Water? I was on the fence a bit due to the lack of any redeeming critical reviews, but the knowledge of how he left Disney for their asking him to compromise his vision made me respect him as an auteur and want to see the finished product. Lady in the Water is a modern fable, gorgeously told and acted, bringing back a communal sense of survival among seemingly disparate apartment complex tenants. These people are brought together under duress and truly show what humanity is and how love and compassion really can conquer all.Cleveland Heap is a lost soul going through the motions of his mundane existence as the superintendent of The Cove. His activities, leading him through the complex, allow us a glimpse into each tenant's quirks at the film's start. Paul Giamatti is wonderful as usually here, playing Heap as a sad sack with an intelligence suppressed underneath. His loss of breath stutters are consistent and never feel forced. Giamatti truly inhabits the role. The horrors of his past weigh heavily on his character and form the basis for his actions, in trusting a pretty young lady and the myth she tells in order to glean some sort of protection. This eponymous lady, named Story, is portrayed by the radiant Bryce Dallas Howard. She once again shows her immense talent with an understated performance, exuding emotion in an almost emotionless, stone-faced delivery. Story is a Narf looking for the one human she has been sent to unlock. As the stories go, Narfs have been in contact with humanity for centuries as muses to help release new thoughts and ideas onto the world. Society, however, has made man a ruthless and hungry race, so protective of their property that they have shut all emotion out. They no longer hear the sea-nymphs and have all at once forgotten their existence. The vessel Story seeks will one day be very influential in the continuing of our species, and she needs to help him see clearly and allow his knowledge to flow out for future generations to experience and cause change in the society that is slowly draining freedom and identity from the masses.Every character in this bedtime story has a purpose. An unknown force has drawn them all to The Cove to eventually help this Narf on her journey. Their powers are latent, only to be unearthed by a series of tragic events leading up to the film's climax. These characters need to put aside their differences and their cultures to unite as one in a greater cause. Jeffery Wright takes a nice realistic turn as Mr. Dury, expert crossword puzzle-solver. His intellect has bred a uniquely gifted child as well as an open-mindedness needed in Story's quest. Bob Balaban is great as the harsh, self-absorbed new tenant who plays a major role in the plot although unknowingly. His character brings to mind Wes Craven's unique idea, while poorly executed, for Scream where each person understands the rules to the story they are in and try to take comfort in them before discovering reality doesn't have a set system of rules at all. The best of these supporters has to be M. Night himself, though. While he has put himself in each of his movies, not counting his two first films that no one seems to know about, although he might be in those too, here he is a lead role. He handles himself very competently and, while definitely an amateur, shows some real feeling in the progression his character takes. A lot of responsibility is laid on his shoulders and that Christ-like conflict of whether to live up to the future set before him or to sit back and let life plummet to destruction is etched on his face throughout.Shyamalan has come into his own as a screenwriter and director. His stories no longer have spells of long drama that just becomes boring. The pacing is carefully orchestrated and the suspense is perfectly timed. Like he did in Signs, leaving the alien to our imagination for as long as possible, he shrouds the evil Scrants, enemies of the Narfs in the Blue World, in darkness until absolutely necessary. The CGI work on these creatures is amazing, and realistic, I'm sure in most part to M. Night's decision to show them at night only. His camera-work is inventive as well, carefully hiding events that would look fake otherwise. A perfect example is at our finale when he shoots a scene from under the ripples of the pool water, meticulously distorting events above water, showing us the action, but without the necessary fake animation work bringing us out of the story. He keeps everything realistic, helping the audience stay immersed in the story without Hollywood moments to remind us we are watching a movie. This ability, in his last two films, has vaulted him onto my list of must-see directors. You feel for the characters and stand by them as they try to accomplish the impossible.",Lady in the Water
80,hall895,A bedtime story gone awry,4,11 June 2007,"Lady in the Water is based on a bedtime story writer/director (and heaven help us, actor) M. Night Shyamalan often told his young daughters. His girls loved it so much that Shyamalan got the bright idea to make the story into a movie. Whoops. Maybe this tale worked as a bedtime story aimed at young children. As a movie aimed at the world at large it doesn't work at all.Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard play the two key roles in the film and they make the best of what they have to work with. Unfortunately they really don't have much to work with at all. Giamatti plays lonely apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep who finds Howard's character swimming in the apartment complex pool. Howard's character in the story is named, uh, Story and she's a narf who will soon be attacked by a Scrunt while all the time wondering when the Tartuic and The Great Eatlon will show up. Well, now I've completely lost you right? Now you know what the experience of watching this movie is like. The whole thing is laughable and rather pointless. The movie goes on and on without ever really going anywhere at all.Nobody ever said movies had to be grounded in reality to be any good. People like a good fantasy now and again. But this is a fantasy gone amuck. This story is much too silly, and boring for that matter, to act as any kind of escape. And matters are not helped by Shyamalan himself playing one of the key roles, that of a writer whose works are destined to change the world. God complex much, Night? Anyway, Shyamalan's ""star turn"" serves only to remind that he's a much better director than an actor. Well, at least he used to be. The one real genuine pleasure in the film comes from the subtle comic touch provided by Bob Balaban, who plays a jaded film critic, obviously meant by Shyamalan to serve as his response to those mean critics who dare to judge his work. What's funny is that this character's comments actually end up pointing out many of this particular film's failings. Not the effect Shyamalan was going for but it will provide you the viewer with a chuckle. But that's about the only positive this film has to offer. Otherwise all we've got is a silly story, laughable dialogue and solid actors trying to keep a straight face while saying ""narf"". Giamatti and Howard deserved better.

82,vip_ebriega,Not one of Shymalan's best works.,5,8 May 2007,"My Take: You can't say Shymalan wasn't using his own original imagination in doing this film, but the story is way too hard to follow.M. Night, who is a specialist of a film maker who likes bringing us into the Twilight Zone and back into humanity, and does both occasionally with his films. With such successful works like ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", it's pretty hard to see why ""Lady in the Water"" fails so easily so fast. It has everything going for it: a fantastic story, which is a bedtime story matched with gripping suspense, great visuals, and fine acting from the stars. But it's hard to see the failure of the project, especially with a mind like M. Night as a guide. It may be the script, which was filled with convolution. It could also be M. Night's lack of vision for the project. It could be any or other than those.Another thing about ""Lady in the Water"" is it's hard to say it's a truly bad work. Sure it's horribly flawed, but who are we to get tough on a mind who just wants the story to unfold the way it was supposed to. But with a film like this, I would have wished Shymalan didn't bake the cake and eat it for himself. I'm sure that, despite all the bashing, Shymalan was just satisfied with what he had done here. This is after all a story he so wished to share to the masses. There is much room for improvement in ""Lady in the Water"". The storyline is a real mess, ranging from dreadfully convoluted to downright dull at times. There are a number of good moments, but in the end the movie never grabbed me for longer than a few minutes. ""Lady in the Water"" is, so far, not M. Night Shyamalan's best work, or not one of them. It is watchable for M. Night's fans, but for those who want to, shall we say, be brought in to the Twilight Zone and back , I suggest watching other of M.

83,vitaleralphlouis,M. Night Spins Another Round of Nonsense,3,22 December 2006,"Paul Giamatti is a fine actor, and having met him personally I'm predisposed to give him a thumbs up when he does a great job as he did in The Illusionist. Herein, though, the job is hopeless in that Mr. M. Night has given him nothing but nonsense to work with.Mr. Giamatti plays a down-in-the-dumps super at a second class Philadelphia apartment building (which looks oddly like a cheap motel). He has good reason for his try-to-look-happy sulk; having lost his wife and children via an unspecified crime. One night he's cleaning the pool and is more-or-less attacked by a half-naked teenybopper (Bryce Dallas Howard) who happens to be a fish --- or at least one of the sea-men as opposed to land-men as the two teams apparently separated centuries ago.In a listless role, Howard is to communicate the lame old message of the '50's science fiction movies, e.g. Mankind Is Too Violent. (Gag me, please.) Not too bad because she forgets the Big Message, being pursued by a violent beast (like the wild boar in LOST) and some other animal that disguises itself as grass-sod (seriously!). It's possible some eagle (not a Philadelphia Eagle, but a mythical eagle) will save the day.Giamatti and the other inmates at the apartment complex set up a huge pool party in order to draw-out the boar-like beast and set the nymphet up for a trip home --- mission forgotten --- via the eagle. All this to fulfill a great pseudo-intellectual point which motivated very many moviegoers to vote this stinker a 10.This review makes no sense, I know that; because the movie makes no sense.

The Philadelphia Enquirer called it, ""...extremely silly."" And the New York Observer said, ""Hollywood cannot pollute the ozone with anything more idiotic, contrived, amateurish or sub-mental than Lady in the Water."" Ouch.No wonder so few went to see it after reading things like that. I know I shied away specifically because of them. But I'd also seen a few positive reviews. Nothing big, really. I attributed most of these to Shyamalan die-hards who'd love anything put out by him regardless of subject matter. That wasn't the only thing that kept me away from the theater, though. Having fell in love with The Sixth Sense (like 99% of the rest of you), I sludged through Unbreakable, Signs, and then The Village. None of them were stellar and they lacked that umpf! we'd come to expect from M. Night. So having invested money and time in many of his previous works, I was extremely hesitant to spend more of either on something that many ""respected"" reviewers found, to say the least, tepid.So when I plopped in the DVD this week and started watching Lady in the Water, I was prepared for the worst. Surprisingly, that's not what I found.If films are supposed to be about entertainment, then Lady in the Water most certainly meets that challenge. Not only that, but I found Paul Giamati's performance to be outstanding. Not since Sideways had I enjoyed a Giamati film so much. He, in fact, carried most of the movie with his excellent portrayal of Cleveland Heep, an apartment manager who one night finds a narf (a water creature) swimming in the compound's pool. The narf is named Story and is played by Bryce Dallas Howard (the blind girl from M. Night's The Village). The movie delves deep into Fairytale-Land and plants the audience firmly in its belief structure. The fact that Story has shown herself to Cleveland is very important in the film, and it shows us that this is something special. Cleveland is given the opportunity to heal himself through Story's visit, and in the process bring together everyone in the apartment complex. All of the people within the apartment building have been drawn here for this one event: to see a narf safely on her way to becoming a segue between the blue world (i.e., the narfs) and the human one.The quirky, quaint, and scary intermingle here as we see a movie reviewer monologuing during a funny yet frightening scene, watch Cleveland come to terms with the death of his family from years before, and witness the battle between humps of grass that come to life with razor sharp teeth and threaten to destroy Story.The heart-wrenching scene between Cleveland, the apartment building's occupants, and the mortally wounded Story has such impact as to cause most watchers to reach for the tissue box.The ending is extremely satisfying and filmed perfectly. When Story has to leave, she does so in fairytale fashion.This is a great story. My only regret now is that I didn't see it in the theater. I'm sure the sound and scenery were even better on the big screen.I also have to wonder about Warner Brothers and the ""falling out"" that they had with M. Night over the film during production. Budget, screenplay and time constraints weighed heavy on all of the parties involved and I think this may have had an impact on reviewers and how the film was marketed. Are some reviewers leery of praising a film from a large studio when that studio has problems with a director/writer? Perhaps. Perhaps not. But the negative reviews of the film seem far out of proportion with what I watched.Lady in the Water was well acted, had a decent screenplay, and told a great story. I'm glad I saw it.",Lady in the Water
85,Rogue-32,don't be afraid to feel it,9,22 July 2006,"Shyamalan is absolutely masterful at creating mood, evoking atmosphere. He doesn't so much make a movie, he casts a spell. Lady In The Water does that brilliantly - it casts an intense, palpable spell, from the clever little prologue, all the way through to the closing credits. Each of his cinematic trips thus far have done this - they create a total reality of their own, and you either let yourself be part of it by accepting it one hundred percent, or you don't.Lady In The Water once again creates its own reality, in spades. Sure, the plot can be construed as ridiculous, unsubtle, absurd. But that's only if you're on the outside, looking in. If you allow yourself, on the other hand, to surrender to the vision, you will have a thoroughly different experience, as I did.The most wonderful thing about this experience is Shyamalan's magnificent casting choice of Paul Giamatti, in the lead role of Cleveland Heep. If you're not one of those who has caught on by now that Giamatti is probably the most brilliant American actor working today, perhaps this movie will convince you. His performance here is breath-taking. There's a scene quite near the end =-= SPOILER ALERT -=- where Giamatti's character has to finally deal with something horrible that happened in his life, to his loved ones, and the way he plays the scene breaks your heart - you can truly feel his anguish, what he's kept pent up inside for so long; the truth of what Giamatti as an actor manages to convey in this scene is transcendent and extraordinary, one of the purest scenes of raw emotion ever committed to celluloid. For this scene alone, I would beg you to surrender yourself to this film.",Lady in the Water
86,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Very poorly conceived film.,2,4 September 2017,"Is film is the worst of M. Night Shyamalan's films I have ever seen. The Six Sense was an awesome film, but the Lady in the Water just seems to feel improvised without a clear moral message to the audience. To me, it was a visual unrelenting rant without purpose. It bored me mercilessly. Not even the pretty redheaded (later in the film, blonde) Bryce Howard could save this film with her good looks. This film is really bad.",Lady in the Water
87,russem31,M. Night Shyamalan's worst to date.,6,4 August 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" (2006) is easily the director's worst film to date. Far removed now from his heyday with ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Signs"", this film doesn't even have his traditional story twist at the end of the film. In fact the film ends quite abruptly, leaving the audience to wonder ""Huh? What just happened?"" Not that this is a bad film, just a very unexceptional one. There wasn't anything new or exciting to make you want to watch. However, I did enjoy Paul Giamatti as Cleveland Heep, though I thought Shyamalan casting himself is a major supporting role was unnecessary, and I felt rather distant from Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal of Story (she did a much better job in ""The Village""). Also, the names used in this film are strange to say the least - they could have picked some better names instead of i.e. Narf. Of special note, James Newton Howard's score for this film is REALLY GOOD. It seems he does his best work with Shyamalan and if for only this reason, I would like to see another Shyamalan film.All in all, this would be what ""Hook"" was for Spielberg - a clunker in the middle of other masterpieces. That said, I look forward to Shyamalan's next film. This one, an average 6 out of 10.",Lady in the Water
88,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Some really good stuff that is unfortunately watered down,4,5 August 2006,"Cleveland Heep is a caretaker of an apartment building. He knows all of his residents, except the one person who is swimming in the pool during after hours. He soon finds out that this is a narf trying to make it back to her world, because she is actually a character in a bedtime story.There are some really interesting things here - character angles, nice music, some really good cinematography, and good acting. The problem is that it is often so ridiculously disjointed that the film is essentially ruined. There are many things going on at once, especially in the end, and the inter-cutting between them is very poor and the pacing horrible. The at times very good cinematography is thrown completely off balance by some horrible shots that are either out of focus or framed poorly. These were almost definitely not mistakes during the film's creation, but the visually the film is quite distorted.The story is very cheesy with some very unbelievably sappy moments, but seeing that this is a fairy tale for kids it is forgivable. However, that is a further distortion that the film faces since it is not presented as such, nor was it advertised as such. Maybe it is the aura that M. Night Shyamalan has created around himself as a director of thrillers that this comes as his biggest disappointment. This is not a thriller, but is shot like one. So that means you go in expecting one movie, you get part of it, but the rest is very out of place and will please some, but not many. Another thing is, which has plagued certain directors - Brian Helgeland and Martin Brest, for instance - that Shyamalan absurdly took full control of this film by writing it, directing it, and producing it. Without much outside input during making a feature length film it is likely that they will get lost unless you think exactly the way the film's director does. That happens here, no doubt. 4/10Rated PG-13, kind of bizarrely, for a few starling, though not at all violent, scenes",Lady in the Water
89,swilliky,A continue decline in quality from Shyamalan,2,23 January 2017,"M. Night Shyamalan went for a meta approach to his fantasy film. The movie strives to deliver twists from the previous film but it fails on several accounts and ends up being rather dull. Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is the handyman around an apartment complex fixing broken sinks and killing pests. He has a tragic past that he doesn't like to tell the residents about. When a woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) appears in the pool, she tells Cleveland extraordinary things that lead to a fantastical adventure.Hunting the lady in the water is the Scrunt, a grass-covered wolf. There are lots of rules and mythology brought into the movie but none of it comes to very much and the characters are almost as confused as I was watching it. The movie takes its time to introduce each resident living in the apartment complex including crossword puzzle solver Mr. Dury (Jeffrey Wright), movie critic Harry Farber (Bob Balaban), and the young college student Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) whose mother knows of a fairy tale and serves as an expositional tool.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Lady in the Water
90,oneloveall,Tediously insulting mockery of the fantasy genre,2,20 December 2006,"In, what to my mind felt like the most pretentious film of the decade, came this ramshackle, self described ""bedtime story"" with all of it's wide eyed efforts to help reinvent the genre of storytelling falling miserably flat. The pomposity of M. Night Shyamalan has finally grown to a point that he will be given little to no credibility in the film industry after the dust had settled for this disastrous misfire of a fable. Based upon a bedtime story the self-absorbed director (and actor) used to tell his own kids, Lady in the Water's story feels like it was directly transcribed by Night's infant child, wallowing in a moronic fantasy lore only convincing enough to move someone predisposed to liking absolutely anything that entails the word fantasy. The main problem here lies with an inability to make any of the superfluous material even remotely engaging to either character or viewer. It is as if the normal life of a man is suddenly cast off to some alternate Disney universe without the slightest transition. Some may justify this as a praise-worthy attempt at conveying a new type of self-conscious fiction through film, but all i could rationalize everything on screen was sheer uninspired laziness, coupled with the bitter feeling of this filmmakers self-importance. Being a fan of the director's often flawed, but generally well made material, it was devastating for me to sit through this 110 minute glorified pre-teen home movie, still with all the sinking heaviness I would expect the once competent writer to implement in a more effective manner. Nothing worked for me in this , not even the two leads- performers who i certainly thought were reliable in their credibility. It is not that Paul Giamatti or Bryce Howard lack esteemed technique when viewing their performances, it is just that the source material is so misguided, it's principal characters so unfounded, that the roles come across awkwardly embarrassing, perhaps even giving these two admirable Thespians questionable integrity for many years to come. Yes, Shyamalan has always displayed a keen eye for composition and a patient hand at the camera, but with it's one location, even fans of the director's technical skills will be asking themselves how many times an arty shot of the pool can keep the pace afloat. I am glad to see at least some people enjoyed Lady in the Water, though i am definitely with the majority on this one. Fantasy is a genre that I seldom pick on, but this fantasy was a nightmare.",Lady in the Water
91,Hayden-86055,M. Night Shyamalan should do better,3,26 December 2020,"A very weird and boring film, and not weird as in unique and exciting but the uninteresting type. Led by a decent Paul Giamatti and a usually good but stale Bryce Dallas Howard. One point of interest is M. Night Shyamalan is in a main role; not just his small cameo, a lot of people have pointed this out as a bit arrogant (a touch unfair in my opinion) for him to put himself in such a big part, but in all honesty whilst not amazing he's not the worst either and even though he's given too much screen time he doesn't ruin the entire film like some make him out to do.It's meant to be a horror/fantasy film but there's not an awful amount of either elements and the horror moments aren't really explained at all.3/10: I really can't recommend this film at all, mildly intriguing in parts but on the whole a failure",Lady in the Water

The biggest problem with the movie is that fantasy is executed in a real world in a very usual settings, without amusing the audience. Hence, it lost between the reality and the fantasy.

I'm sure this made a great bedtime fairy tale, but in MKS's hands it has turned into ""The Archetype Movie"".I think it would have turned out a lot better if he had managed to maintain an aura of mystery around the main characters. But everything is spelled out for you. The Narf ends up being just like any human being...fears, hopes, fallibility, and conversational English. You never feel that you're watching a supernatural creature.Finally, MKS needs to stay out of his own movies. His character in this movie seems to be a parody of the hilarious parody of his acting that we saw in ""Scary Movie 3"".

94,dr_foreman,Agreeably Lame,6,29 July 2006,"""Lady in the Water"" isn't quite the atomic bomb that critics say it is - nor is it actually a good movie.It's got atmosphere and imagination, I'll grant it that. But it drags sometimes. Shyamalan is so enamored with his weird fantasy concepts that he actually develops them too much. Long chunks of the movie are dedicated to tedious exposition, as various characters are forced to lay out the intricate ground rules of Shyamalan's made-up universe. The effect of this is that I often felt like I was reading a boring instruction manual about fantasy creatures, not watching an exciting adventure featuring those creatures in action.On the plus side, the main characters are well cast. Giamatti is always a sympathetic everyman, and isn't it nice to look at Bryce's legs the whole time? I wonder, though, what Bob Balaban really gets out of playing boring parts in movie after movie.The peripheral characters are a different story. I find it a little weird that Shyamalan, of all directors, should resort to using lots of funny ethnic stereotypes. This movie features goofy/abrasive Asian characters, hyperactive/silly Latino characters, and even a chatterbox Cockney stoner. Aye Carumba! It's not very politically correct, is it?The monster's okay - pretty good, for a CGI effect. I personally think it's funny, though, that the best rubber monsters still look better than what digital rendering can do today (witness as evidence John Carpenter's 1980s version of The Thing - it puts the Scrunt to shame!)Speaking of Scrunts, aren't the names in this movie silly? What's so mysterious about a creature called a ""Madame Narf""? Maybe the term ""Madame Narf"" says it all about ""Lady in the Water."" It's made-up, it's silly, it's lame, but somehow...it entertains. Just about.",Lady in the Water

Such is strictly forbidden by the building rules and so he goes out to find who it is. What he finds is a lady. But not just any lady. As I find his films best enjoyed on the least possible information I won't go into the story any further.And with that begins another film by M. Night Shyamalan, who is by now known and indeed somewhat expected to come with films that bring an odd twist to their story. This film is both different and the same when compared to his other films. The setting this time is a fairy tale - but in a modern suburban environment. It works out pretty well.The build of the film is pretty much solid - a lot of characters that need introducing, a minimalist setting (everything plays within the bounds of the apartment building complex), and most of the actors play their roles out as they are supposed to.There's comic relief, there's suspense, there's mystery. All in all, some good fun for a good evening.8 out of 10 mysteries in the water.",Lady in the Water
96,doctorsmoothlove,"Nearly unwatchable, but limited appeal",3,30 January 2008,"There are many problems with this film. The most obvious of which is the complete suspension of reason required to watch it. A good fantasy film creates a believable world, so the events that it portrays have some basis in the created reality. ""Lady in the water"" tries to create a mystical world within the real one, and it fails. What I'm saying is that it is very difficult to accept that a water person, a grass dog, and some odd monkey creatures (who are not adequately explained and appear for only a few moments near the end) within the real world of Philadelphia. Wouldn't someone have noticed all of these earlier? The film makes no effort to convince the audience that it's premise is real. We just have to accept it but that's difficult when GPS and satellites have discovered all of the Earth's secrets.Throughout the entire film, it felt like Shaymalan created turns just to resolve them. Was it really necessary to have such conflict over who the guardian, healer, and guild were? I believe that it took three different attempts to determine the guild's identity. In an effort to build suspense, Shaymalan just annoys the audience. Also, the movie critic character appeared to be Shaymalan's attempt to silence the critics within the film itself. Other than that, his presence was completely unnecessary. Furthermore, the characters (other than Cleveland) are so poorly constructed, that they become nothing more than random people. These actors seem built for a comedy film but this role required them to be more serious than their performance. Shaymalan's decision to cast himself as the writer was also very awkward. Is he arrogant for thinking only he could play the role, or was he actually the correct person to play the role? I'd like to see a documentary on the subject.I would not recommend seeing this film. It is poorly executed and the plot is too convoluted to allow the audience to identify with the film. The message the film wishes to give is very obvious from the beginning and it never deepens. I'm not sure if this film could have been better, but I do think that Shaymalan should have hired a writer to review is script and plot before he started this failed project. Like the title implies, ""Lady in the Water"" is all wet.",Lady in the Water
97,Nightman85,Shyamalan returns with a bed time story...,7,24 July 2006,"The latest film from director M. Night Shyamalan is this tale of dark fantasy.When a mysterious young woman rescues an apartment custodian, he discovers a supernatural war is taking place in his own back yard.I have long admired the works of M. Night Shyamalan, even as plenty of critics around me have hated them, so it was no surprise to me that I found myself enjoying this film too. Yet, I'm also the first to admit that this film isn't quite as good as some of his previous works. Lady in the Water is a very imaginative and intriguing story, that becomes some what muddled on logic at times. Story-wise this film also doesn't have quite the same heart of Shyamalan's earlier works. One thing Shyamalan's movies always seem to do well is establish likable and heart-felt characters, and while the characters in Lady in the Water aren't unlikable they don't possess the kind of depth that one expects. It also doesn't help that Shyamalan also tries make a political statement in the film either. For me, that only takes one out of the story.However, despite my complaints this is still a good film. The story is entertaining with some good scares and characters that are often humorous. Shyamalan's direction is graceful as always and the cast (as well as the FX) isn't half bad.So all around Lady in the Water is an enjoyable film, especially for Shyamalan fans.*** out of ****",Lady in the Water
98,MichaelMargetis,"Don't Listen to the Critics, 'Lady' is Great!",8,2 October 2006,"In my personal belief, 'Lady in the Water' M. Night Shyamalan's latest picture is being battered and abused by film critics for no reason. Reading their reviews, they seem to attack Shyamalan more than the film itself. That is wrong, that the critics are being so personal and nasty about it. The fact is critics don't like M. Night Shyamalan because they don't like his storytelling technique, a very original and innovative one if you ask me. If I could impart anything to you it is to NOT listen to the critics when they blast this film. It's entertaining, nicely put-together, not full of holes with great acting, directing and writing. There's really nothing to complain about in my opinion. Paul Giamatti is remarkable as Cleveland Heep, the caretaker of a motel where the 'lady' is spotted swimming in the pool. I can't imagine anyone else bringing as much life, compassion and comedic as well as dramatic value to the character besides the incredibly talented Giamatti. Bryce Dallas Howard is probably the weakest link of the cast, but the supporting players including Jeffery Wright (Angels in America), Freddy Rodriguez (Six Feet Under), Jared Harris (Happiness), Bob Balaban (Waiting For Guffman), Bill Irwin (Broadway's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) and most surprisingly M. Night Shyamalan more than make up for Howard's shortcomings. M. Night Shyamalan masterfully directs this flick, and although it makes some huge leaps with the writing, it's constantly entertaining, and let's face facts, it's a freakin' fantasy movie! A movie that features plant-backed werewolves and tree monkeys doesn't have to be plausible! This installment may disappoint because it doesn't have a twist ending, but if you ask me, I felt the ending was compelling enough without a twist. Again, don't listen to the critics when they call this film a 'flop' because it's not. Although it's not quite as good as 'The Sixth Sense', 'Signs' or 'The Village', it's a very well-crafted film by one of America's most intriguing new filmmakers, M. Night Shyamalan.

Night: M stands for ""Messiah""",1,8 September 2011,"We know something is wrong when the size of the directors' name on the poster rivals the size of the actual title. To mind comes the name ""Quentin Tarantino"", written in towering letters, followed by a tiny ""presents some director or other"". I admit: I'm not a fan of hypes.Neither was I ever a huge M. Night Shyamalan fan: ""The Sixth Sense"" had a clever twist but was generally overrated. ""Unbreakable"" could have been a good film if somebody familiar with the medium comic-book would have directed it (to mind comes Zack Snyder) and ""Signs"" – well, let's just say that I didn't walk out because it was shown on board an airplane. But I greatly enjoyed ""The Village"", which – together with Tim Burtons ""Big Fish"" – may be one of America's last cinematic fairy-tales. This movie in mind, I went to see ""Lady in the Water"" – and barely trusted my eyes.Let's skip the rendition of the story; if you're already on the review page, you have either seen the movie or read the description. Let's also skip giving praise to the films good sides: nice, cheesy music, nice cinematography – nothing can redeem the mess of this story.What ails the film like a rotting tooth, sits right in the centre of the film.

I personally kept waiting, convinced that any seconds the skies would open up and that god would make a personal appearance, possibly painted by Terry Gilliam. I also waited for Shyamalan to break the fourth wall and start jabbering to the audience directly. Fortunately, neither happened.The worst that could be said about this film is that not one producer had the good sense to get up and say: ""Wait a minute! Stop this sham"", but perhaps that says more about Hollywood's mercenary mindset than anything else. So, let us give this movie one point because a) IMDb doesn't have a zero-point rating and b) there's still the mathematical chance that Night may be the next messiah, in which case we want to stay on his good side.",Lady in the Water

104,moviemanMA,Unsure,6,25 April 2007,"A child's bedtime story is supposed to be one filled with mystery, magic, and overcoming evil. They need a character that they can relate to and put themselves in their shoes. When that flame of imagination is put out, the story dies and the child is not interested any more. If a story can't relate to it's intended audience, the result is disappointing.M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water is exactly that. A story that has the right idea and the right motive mixed in with the wrong story being preached to the wrong audience. The story centers around an apartment complex called The Cove. At the cove all the tenants are looked after by Mr. Heap (Paul Giamatti), a man whose past haunts him depriving him of the joys of life. His work is dull and not fulfilling. Before he knows it, he is thrown into a whirlwind of fantasy and confusion.One night he finds a woman in the swimming pool. He doesn't know where she is from and doesn't understand what she is doing in his pool. And just like that he is engulfed in a ""bedtime story"" about sea nymphs named narfs, the wolf-like creatures called scrunts that hunt them, and the difficulties endured from trying to find a way to get her back home. In a series of coincidences and strange occurrences, Mr. Heap and Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), the sea nymph, must try and use the tenants for playing certain roles of the bedtime story. In order for Story to be brought back home, everything must go according to plan.One part of the plan that didn't go right is the plot. The story that M. Night has written for his children, although it comes out nice in the children's book, it doesn't translate well on film. The characters are too old for children to connect with and the creatures are too scary for children to sit through. There is a big difference between imagining and seeing it on screen. For adults, the point of the story is to bring out the inner child that believed in these type of stories and fairy tales. Unfortunately the story just doesn't flow. It happens to fast and everything is accepted. Granted, that is the point, it is all too unrealistic and although it is fun to believe in sea nymphs, giant eagles, and far away lands, to throw it all together in a fantasy thriller just doesn't do it justice.M. Night's films prior to Lady have been of high quality story lines and impressive symbolism that the audience has to look for. Here everything is solved for us. There isn't the fun of trying to figure out how to solve the problem like he did in The SIxth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village. For a movie to be enjoyable in this genre, the audience needs to be able to guess throughout and not just watch and let it unfold in an obvious, overused manner.Giamatti is the highlight of the film. His character is very well developed and he seems to dig and and get his feet wet for the role. The supporting cast is mediocre at best and fills the roles to some degree.Lady in the Water had the right idea: to convince adults to believe again in something that is beyond the norm and delves into the imagination. A better story and perhaps the right direction would have made a more acceptable medium to convey this message.",Lady in the Water
105,wrlang,unexpectedly good,9,31 December 2006,"Lady in the Water is a very good film from Shyamalan about a bed time story come to life. All legends have some basis in reality, some more so than others. I loved the acting and directing in this film even though it wasn't the horror film I assumed it would be. Bryce Howard was able to express a great deal in the minimal dialog she was allowed to have. A sea nymph is dropped in on an apartment house to find a visionary that will write the future of the world and she fights invisible threats with the help of her human friends. One human friend, excellently played by Giamatti, help more than others despite his own hidden tortures. While I was expecting some hidden twist at the very end like The Village, I was not disappointed in the film.",Lady in the Water
106,charchuk,"Bizarre, unique story beautifully executed",8,19 August 2006,"An interesting fable that utilizes one of the strangest metaphors I've seen in film. Definitely M. Night's weirdest and most original film yet. The tagline ""A Bedtime Story"" is dead-on accurate, as the film opens with a cartoon representation of the prologue to the aforementioned bedtime story, and finishes with a happy ending. What happens in between, though, is one of the most bizarre and unique tales told at any bedtime. This is not a mermaid movie, this is a imaginative fantasy that works - and works well - due to great performances, colourful characters, and an intriguing story.My biggest gripe with the film was its lack of depth. Though it is about the same length as Night's previous four films, it feels far too short, and I wish it would have added about 15-20 minutes of character depth to some of the cast, most notably Giamatti's Cleveland Heep. The story takes a bit of time to get going, but then it feels rushed toward the climax, and could have used a bit more build-up to more effectively draw us into the story. Even though, I felt very drawn into this story, despite its strangeness (or, perhaps, because of it), due to great character interactions and superb writing. Two minor complaints would be the film critic character (an obvious attempt by Night to snub his nose at those who critique his films, and completely out of place in this one) and Night casting himself in a pivotal role (a sure sign that his ego may be getting abnormally large). However, they are quite minor, and did not detract from the film while I was watching it - only after did I notice it. Still, the lack of depth truly hurts this film.The film's positive qualities, however, are much greater. The story is very involving and interesting, and never feels too far-fetched or unbelievable. The characters are amusing and entertaining, but mostly there for just that, with the exception of Giamatti's protagonist, who is layered, complex, and very real. Indeed, Giamatti gives by far the best performance of the film, as his character's transformation throughout the film is not only noticeable but quite realistic. Howard is solid as the 'narf' of the title, and Night himself is decent in a central, albeit small, part. The visuals are exceptional, as one would expect from a Shyamalan film, and the direction and cinematography are creative and outstanding. The special effects, one of the weak spots with 'Signs', are used sparingly here, but are fantastic, and the production design is simple, but effective. All in all, a fantastic production.Overall, this is probably Night's weakest film, but that's like saying that the fourth runner-up at the Miss Universe is the ugliest of the top five. This is a magnificent fairy tale, set in a modern day environment, with a colourful cast and a compelling story. Perhaps a bit shallow in its portrayal of the lead character, but it's still a very well-told story, and beautifully realized. Nearly perfect and my favourite of the year thus far.",Lady in the Water
107,christian123,It tried too hard to be creative and special. It ended up being just silly but still held a little entertainment value.,5,2 January 2007,"Building superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) notices strange happenings in the building's swimming pool at night, and when he investigates, he discovers a beautiful young woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is there on a mission, which Cleveland takes upon himself to help her finish.Lady in the Water offers a good premise that is ruined by an underwhelming execution. The ideas and characters are interesting but the film just ended up being too silly with a ridiculous conclusion. I'm not sure who to blame for this misfire. M. Night Shyamalan has a good imagination and he did come up with an interesting story. However, as the film progressed, it was hard to stomach some of the characters and scenes. It was also hard to accept that everyone believed that Story was telling the truth. Why would they believe some random girl? The movie believes all this fairytale stuff is true and it wants the viewer to do the same which I couldn't do. The serious tone of the film was really annoying at times and most of the ""serious"" scenes encouraged unintentional laughter more than anything else.Behind the camera, he did a little better. He moved the film at a decent pace and it never slowed down. He also managed to create some tense moments although they were few and far in between. I didn't like how Shyamalan made his character the key to everything in the film. It just came off as a little egotistical. The one thing that the movie was trying to tell the audience was that man isn't child-like anymore and the world is on the brink of disaster. However, ""The Cookbook"" will change everything in the future and it will save mankind. Also, everyone in life has a purpose and we are all connected. It's a cute idea for a third grader but for most people it's just ridiculous. The characters carry out this idea without really stopping to question the absurdity of it all. The entire second half is a disaster including the ending which has to be one of the worst of the year.For the most part, the acting wasn't very good. Most of it was unnatural and the silly dialog killed a lot of the actors. Paul Giamatti was okay although he should leave this one off his resume. Bryce Dallas Howard was really creepy so she suited her character and she gave a decent performance. Cindy Cheung was just playing a stereotype. Freddy Rodriguez was just annoying. Bob Balaban was okay as the cynical critic and his character was there to show that Shyamalan doesn't care what the critics think and he thinks they are too uptight. Overall, Lady in the Water is one of the most disappointing films of the year. I was somewhat entertained yet I was still expecting a lot more. Rating 5/10",Lady in the Water
108,kdnor2011,"Great ideas, OK movie.",6,28 June 2011,"Lady in the water is my least favorite M. Night Shymalan film, yes I'm serious. Yet I don't think it's nearly as bad as people say it is, I mostly just find it disappointing as to what it could have been. Like the Village and the Happening, the trailer for this movie lied to people making it seem like a horror movie, when it actually a fantasy, a bedtime story fairy tale.What's my main problem with this movie? Well, it's only conflict is that this Narf has to get home. Nothing else, it's not like if she doesn't go home everyone will die, it's just this. This wouldn't be so bad, except we would need to care for this Narf A lot. She isn't bad, I don't want her to die, but if she did, I really wouldn't be crying or anything. It's very slow at times, Cleveland's stuttering got annoying, and the fact that Shymalan casts himself as someone very important is extremely pretentious.I love the idea of this film, how several members of this apartment are part of the story. Basically this is a movie that is way better in the story department than in the characters department. The buildup is good, even though the Narf is kind of meh. The acting is actually pretty good, Bryce Dallas Howard played the Narf extremely well. I like how the entire movie takes place in the apartment coplex, as if nothing else exists. The direction is great. Really it's just a mehish movie.Lady in the Water doesn't live up to it's full potential, but it isn't horrible. That's really all I can say about it.",Lady in the Water
109,nobbytatoes,a fairytale?,3,19 September 2006,"I remember when I first saw The Sixth Sense. A genre bending, avant-garde film, changing the supernatural thriller. With two films previously under his belt, this film shot M. Night Shyamalan's career into the stratosphere. The Sixth Sense showed that Shyamalan had talent, and one director to avidly watch. Yet he was struck with ""the difficult second album"". Unbreakable finally came, and everything just shattered, the jinx of the follow up struck hard.Since The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan followed a formula; a story arc with supernatural touches, and the all important final twist he became famous for. It was the final twist that drew you to his films. Once you heard the story line, you wondered what the final twist would be. The Sixth Sense was hard hitting with it's unfamiliarity, and the twist that shocked and boggled your mind. Unbreakable, Sings and The Village all had the trouble of holding twists that could still shock you, with The Sixth Sense looming over their heads. Maybe with the final twist not to be seen in Lady in the Water, a sigh of relief can be had.The biggest part about Shyamalan's films is; you're either gonna go along with it and swallow what he's presenting, or you're stuck at bay and wondering where did it all go wrong. After Unbreakable, Shyamalan started to build himself back up again with Sings, and The Village, but Lady in the Water just drowns in a pool of it's own aspirations.Lady in the Water is Shyamalan's bedtime fairy tale, which he created for his kids. Lady walks the line of a fairy tale, with strange characters; the body builder only working on one side of his body, the film critic; (who's narration of reviewing the ploys and formality of films, which play out in Lady, screech like nails on a blackboard), the reclusive man, the writer unable to write, all hold their purpose yet unaware of their importance. Strange names for the Lady; Story, and the beasts; Scrunts, The Blue World where the Narfs come from, create a difficult hurdle to accept this fairy tale. Fairy tales are special stories as they hold a moral to them, with Lady as Shyamalan's attempt of observing the worlds current times and how horrible things are; the opening sequence tries to hit you with a poignant moment, but the cave style drawings come off childish.Lady in the Water is Shymalan's kid's story, but would a kid understand the story, matter of fact does anyone really understand, are we meant to understand. The story doesn't board on convoluted, it jumps the fence and runs wild. Lady in the Water should ignite your imagination, Shyamalan's certainly did with this, but it all seems fake and terribly executed. Character's are given a specific agenda which they play their part, their importance rooted in the mundane aspects of life. Shyamalan tries to capture that spark over the little moments of life, but its not captivating, and reaches far fetched; just watch where the Symbolists get the prophecy from, talk about a kick in the teeth.Holding this all together lies on the shoulders of one man, Paul Giamatti. He is simply amazing and such an over looked actor. He really carries the film, though he doesn't stop it from the pit of despair; the finger points straight at Shyamalan, who's writing and directing suffer from an overly high hubris and ego attack, playing the writer who's book hold significances. Bryce Dallas Howard is quite good, though her glazed stare at times becomes too much.This is one film that floats dead in the water, Shyamamlan has a lot of work now to build up from this catastrophe.",Lady in the Water
110,Okonh0wp,Shamylan's sheer imaginative powers make it work,7,26 July 2006,"One of the tenants in the apartment building, where Lady in the Water takes place, is a crotchety old film critic who he feels he's seen it all. ""I have come to accept there's nothing original left in this world,"" he says. This is ironic because if this fictitious character knew of the movie he was inadvertently a part of, he would think differently. It is hard to deny that if nothing else, M. Night Shamylan has a very unique voice. He certainly isn't the only current filmmaker who's original but everything in the tone of his films from the characters to the setting and plot feels a little bit off the norm. In Lady in the Water, Shamylan conjures up a fantasy world that intrigues us in the in the way it intersects with a seemingly mundane group of tenants in an apartment. The lady referenced in the title (Bryce Dallas Howard) is a sea nymph who is discovered in the apartment's pool* by the building's super, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Giamatti reaffirms how underrated of an actor he is in the way he gives unforeseen depth to the character of Cleveland. Mourning the death of his wife and kids, Cleveland is a hesitant and uneasy man with a stutter. However, when the girl says her life is in danger, he is overcome with too much empathy and devotes himself to helping her find her way back home. A cryptic folk story told to him by one of his tenants reveals the identity of the girl as an otherworldly prophetic figure who seeks out three groups of tenants in the building and Cleveland must sift through the colorful group of characters that populate his building to find out who they are. The film creates a constant state of suspense with shots reminiscent of Jaws that show victims being attacked from the point-of-view of the sharks, or in this case mythical beasts that Howard's character is fleeing from. It's main strength, however, is how Shamylan's storytelling is different from anything we've ever seen before. Even when the film moves a little slow or gets bogged up in plot holes, we're too intrigued by Shamylan's vivid imagination not to want to follow along and see where he's going. *One quick potential plot hole to clear up in case you're wondering how it could be remotely believable to have a sea nymph appear out of a swimming pool: this pool isn't a concrete hole in the ground but rather it was built over some natural body of water and the sea nymph appears out of some chasm and emerges through a vent.",Lady in the Water
111,jamiedarlow-37510,A passionately made oddball!,7,15 March 2020,"Definately M. Night's strangest film but if you can suspend disbelief, it's very rewarding. Set at an apartment block named The Cove, the go-to handyman of the place Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) suspects someone is going into the pool after hours. One night he rescues a young girl named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the pool. He quickly discovers she is actually a character from a legendary bedtime story and she will need his help to get back home. Created by Shyamalan through a real bedtime story he used to tell his daughters, it's quite fascinating hearing behind the scenes how the story became legendary in his household and it grew more detailed as his children requested they hear more about it. I'm very nostalgic about this film as I watched it in my early teens and really liked it, mainly because it features the most underrated performance from Paul Giamatti. Cleveland is such a sweet and kind character that really moved me. The creature design by Crash McCreery is great and he also made beautiful illustrations for M Night's book of the same name which is worth seeking out. Massive well done to the visual effects departments for creating one of the most memorable shots in the film of the Eagle in the sky! The cast are all great and clearly have a lot of fun making it; the humour naturally comes from them all! Although it's a lovely premise and light hearted, it has a very odd tone throughout and I think it received a lot of negative criticism due to this and perhaps the fact that there is a dig to film criticism in the script through one character, a film critic (played by the great Bob Balaban) depicted as an arrogant snob particularly in the last half. I can understand why some viewers find it tonally uneven which I've noticed more as I've gotten older but I think it's a well made fantasy with nice performances, another beautiful score by James Newton Howard and everyone made it with a passion for making something a bit different",Lady in the Water
112,Danny_G13,"Ludicrous story, brilliantly told.",8,10 December 2006,"Another fairy tale from Shyamalan following in the footsteps of the absurd Village and decent Unbreakable.It's safe to say M Night Shyamalan has gained something of a reputation since he burst onto the scene in 1999 with the stunning debut Sixth Sense. A superb script, performances, direction, and of course 'that twist' left cinema-goers reeling from the masterpiece they'd witnessed.Regrettably, with such impeccable distinction comes intense pressure to live up to such achievement, and this is where the director has fallen ever so slightly. His second piece was the decent Unbreakable, again starring Bruce Willis, but it lacked the sparkle of his original work. Then came Signs, which was an exercise in superb direction but uncharming plot and flimsy cohesion; and an ultimately weak ending. The downfall was complete when the truly comical Village showed up, a movie which took absurdity to new levels.And yet, Night still has a reputation, and each new movie is highly anticipated, with viewers harbouring hope that he can emulate the magnificence of Sixth Sense.Well, Lady in the Water doesn't *quite* scale those heights, but it definitely is by far and away the best of the rest of his work.Amusingly though, it starts out dismally, with high suspension of belief required to carry it. Indeed, the craziness of the story and the supernatural content we're expected to swallow nearly convinces the viewer that Night is slowly losing his own sanity.It even persists, and for the kind of viewer who doesn't easily embrace fairy tales, Lady in the Water appears to be evidence of the work of a madman for lengthy spells of the first half.And yet, signs (no pun intended) are there of the genius direction and wonderful cinematography that Shyamalan is capable of. They make the movie very watchable indeed while the plot seems to be losing itself.This continues for long enough before suddenly the story clicks into gear, and the absurdity starts to weave itself into something approaching believability. It is the ease with which such a complex and nigh-on silly story finds its feet, and the method to Night's madness being revealed which not only saves this movie, but makes a genuinely smart piece of it.The acting is actually pretty irrelevant throughout, because it's the story and direction which wins the day, and for that Night deserves applause.With Lady in the Water, he's found himself once more, and has shown a serious glimpse again of what he is capable.",Lady in the Water

I think the story was quite interesting and original but the plot I feel it kind of plain and not fully developed, there were no twists or surprises, and I feel that the ending is lacking of the necessary closure to the story. It has a decent cast, with an outstanding performance by Paul Giamatti, Bryce Dallas Howard was good but it was also a kind of plain performance, I didn't watch any emotion in her acting and M Night Shyamalan should reconsider not to act again, he must devote to the one thing he knows how to do, that is direct.",Lady in the Water
114,gpeevers,I Usually Tend to Agree with the Critical Consensus But I Enjoyed This Far More than Most,8,17 June 2009,"The story is that of strange girl named Story who seemingly lives under the pool of an apartment complex until she is discovered by the building superintendent Cleveland.Lady in the Water is an usual film even for M. Night Shymalan. I believe to truly enjoy this film it is necessary to make a leap of faith and except the film as it has been described a Bedtime Story. Although it might seem pretentious the film originated from a bedtime story Shymalan had made up for his daughters. If an audience is unable to accept that level of reality than the impact of the faults that exist in the film are likely to be swell to the point the film will not be enjoyed.While some may find fault with the story and perhaps the direction most will find merit in the films other aspects, the cinematography from Christopher Doyle is certainly striking and the score by James Newton Howard is effective.We also have another very fine performance from Paul Giammati and while Bryce Dallas Howard is given a fairly subdued role she is none the less quite effective. The rest of the cast (due to its size) gets little chance to shine despite their talent due to limited screen time and thus minimal character development. But Bob Balaban in only a few scenes creates a memorable character, and newcomer Cindy Cheung also stands out though some may say in a racially stereotyped role. Many have pointed out that Shymalan here gives himself a far larger role than normal and that he cast himself in a martyr role which might be egotistical. While there might be some truth to this assertion it's easy for me to overlook while immersed in the movie and any such feelings only arise for me on later reflection and don't impinge on my enjoyment.Many have argued that M. Night Shymalan has been on a slide ever since his enormous break out hit ""The Sixth Sense"". I also greatly enjoyed ""Unbreakable"", though I would agree his other efforts have not matched his initial promise.",Lady in the Water
115,jmbwithcats,A Folktale Best left In Books,3,28 July 2006,"Lady in the Water is a folktale I would have got more out if in the reading, than of the watching as a film.The movie had far too many moments that seemed pointless to the story and should have been left on the editing room floor.The movie really just moves too slowly, like crawls along, I think I saw an out of body snail cruise past me on the digital highway.The problems with Lady isn't the acting or the story, but a misuse of characters, bad dialog, and uninspired directing. Perhaps if M Night had crafted the story but had someone else direct it, similar to how George Lucas crafted most of his Star Wars films.The constantly finding the right people in the complex gets a little boring, and gives the chapters a sense of uncertainty as to which way the story is going.Because of the constant emotional shifts throughout the film, from the man from the humane society, to a naked girl in the shower, to a group of people, than a party, another group of people, back to the party, a child interpreter, it was just a jumbled mess... I felt far too often pulled out of the movie, the sense of wonder in the first few minutes is lost so many times during the film that I simply lost interest in the story.Also there's simply no reason for everyone to believe this story all of a sudden and so unflinchingly follow it without any proof. Why would people have unerring faith in a folktale in the form of a pale naked girl? Maybe if she were really hot... Just kidding, I just got rather bored of the direction this film took early on, like a stumbling in the woods, wandering wandering and unskillfully wandering at that.Psychic healing is not new, though tends to come to those who practice all their life through true paths of discipline, which made this all the more unrealistic, drawing me yet again out of the story.In the end the grassy and blood drench-eyed jaguar and Trogdor armed with Excalibur pool cleaner version battle, while Stephen Colbert Jr. swoops down to save the lady of the lake, and King Arthur of the apartments gives her one last hug, and she is gone, leaving the guild members looking up to the heavens, watching the eagle soar over the brazen landscape of hope, night, and 2 hours gone from our lives.",Lady in the Water

117,barberoux,I liked it.,7,28 July 2006,"I was apprehensive about seeing this movie since the reviews have been generally bad. I liked Mr. Shyamalan's previous movies so I ignored the reviews and went to see it. I liked it. The movie had its flaws, one big one, and a few smaller ones. The small ones were mostly pacing issues. I thought it slow at points and a bit maudlin but overall I enjoyed this movie. Paul Giamatti was very good playing the rumpled lead. He was very believable, likable, funny and touching. He did a wonderful job. Bryce Dallas Howard was ethereal The rest of the cast including Bob Balaban, Jeffrey Wright, Bill Irwin, Cindy Cheung and many others were very good in their roles. There was one huge miscast, M. Night Shyamalan. He is not a good actor. He is not believable nor likable. Given his recent bad press due to his big ego, his inclusion in the movie just turned off the movie goers. He would help sell his movies more by being the first person killed by the monsters or by playing off his big ego reputation. Instead he casts himself as a pivotal character the audience is supposed to feel for. It didn't work. In fact it could have possibly destroyed the movie's chances. Maybe the strength of Paul Giamatti's likability may overcome Mr. Shyamalan's dis-likability. I hope so because this movie has a lot to offer. It is a fairy tale. If you expect a monster movie or a slasher type movie you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a typically morally corrupt Hollywood movie with product placement, blazing guns and copious cleavage look elsewhere. Once you accept the premise of the movie and allow yourself to get into the story the movie is very enjoyable. I laughed at the characters and I enjoyed the craft of the movie. As much as I dislike Mr. Shyamalan's acting I like his skill at making movies. The photography was excellent. The scene construction was excellent. The cast was excellent. The story was preposterous but it was a fairy tale and you have to accept that. I would give Mr. Shyamalan a well done for the movie but stay away from the acting side of the camera. I think it is worth seeing. It has a unique style and contrasts with the derivative crap coming out of Hollywood. By the way the theater I saw the movie in, a Regal Entertainment Group theater, was dirty. The picture was blurry at times and the staff was inattentive and rude. About par for what passes as customer service in the suburban multiplexes. The movie deserved better.",Lady in the Water

He has had something happen in his past that brought him to this place in life. He knows all the various players who live in his complex. He knows all their foibles and faults and good qualities. He's insightful.One night this girl comes out of the pool, Bryce Dallas Howard. This was a disappointing performance, compared to The Village where she was great. She plays this nymph who is going to do something for the planet. Giamatti guards her. All she does is look sad and cower and sometimes smile, and speaks in a soft voice. No much of a role for her, or a performance.This Korean woman and her mother play key roles because the mother seems to know something about a story about a nymph. Giamatti pulls it all together and thinks he knows how to save the day, but does he?There's also a supernatural bad guy who is trying to stop everything. But the tension, well, it's not much IMHO. At the end, a bit of a twist, but not like The Sixth Sense type. Shyalaman loves to get the twists in though. I liked this movie, but it's just OK, so 6/10 covers it. It is what it is, a simple story that was told. Giamatti was great, but otherwise, nothing you will remember.",Lady in the Water

There are no stand-out clichés, and there really isn't a plot to speak of other than just a weird, surreal bedtime story.The characters are not flat, the story isn't predicable, and I personally didn't get bored. I'm not really sure what it is that made me like this movie. I assume if you looked deep enough there would be something there that was a philosophy on storytelling, but I never really thought about it. All I can say is it is different in that it is not something you'd expect to see in the American mainstream at all.I see why people wouldn't like this, but I also don't exactly understand why so many don't. It deserves to be watched because it is so different, but that's really all there is to say. No, it's not scary but neither is most any horror movie I've seen. And this isn't even horror as much as fantasy, though it's a fantasy that isn't exactly like you've seen a hundred times.

120,Jay_Exiomo,Lady gets bogged down and soggy,3,19 July 2006,"I do concede that M. Night Shyamalan is a talented man, and has a special way of being able to demand compelling performances from actors willing to work with him. But it definitely turned out badly for him in creating ""The Village"" two years ago. Creepy as the film was, its ""Shyamalan-esque"" ending was so ludicrous that eventually bogged down the artistry of the rest of it. With ""Lady in the Water"", he attempts to weave a different layer into a film that was passed on by Disney and eventually picked up by Warner Bros., but in the end this stylish bedtime tale falls flat on its face due to a discombobulated and bumbling plot.The movie revolves around a building manager named Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) who finds a young woman named Story (Howard) swimming in the building pool in the dead of the night. She turns out to be a ""narf"", a character from a bedtime story who is trying to return from our world to theirs. Soon, Cleveleand learns that he is also a part of the story and that together with some of the building tenants, they must protect Story from the dangers that lurk and ensure her safety as she travels back to her world. On paper, ""Lady in the Water"" could have been a good film, with its intriguing thriller-cum-fantasy premise, a cast roster with names like Paul Giamatti, Jeffery Wright, Bryce Dallas Howard, and M. Night Shyamalan himself in his biggest role yet.But the promise is barely delivered and worse, it is delivered haphazardly. At its core, ""Lady in the Water"" is a film that examines the issues of faith and the microcosm of a community - issues which Shyamalan have explored in his last two outings - but it suffers from clunky and boring dialog. It also doesn't help that the script seems to be going for a mythological feel (as opposed to an atmospheric one), yet this picture begins balefully, employing lots of Shyamalan's trademark camera-work and eerily quiet scenes, that fails since the characters are specifically written with some sort of Utopian mindset that does have a bearing on the ending, albeit without his signature ""twist"". That said, the overall quality here is humdrum and ineffective.Acting is mediocre at best and one-note at worst. The cast try hard but, with a lot of characters to go around with, some are left underdeveloped. Giamatti seems to sleepwalk throughout the film, although it's hard to presume and say for sure because it may be the point so that his performance fits the pace of the film. Howard is passable but she makes a good soul of the film. Shyamalan's role as that of a writer seems one cathartic response to the roasting he received for ""The Village"" but in his defense, the guy does portray some depth in his acting. Wright and Bob Balaban are squandered with a lifeless characterization.""Lady in the Water"" has got to be Shyamalan's weakest film thus far. I'm not saying that he's losing his talent as a filmmaker because the storytelling is still there. But I sure wish he'd recover the lost magic that once inhabited his works.",Lady in the Water
121,rparham,Somewhat unpalletable 'Water',5,23 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan's fame is an interesting phenomenon. Rocketed from obscurity to directorial super-stardom with his 1999 film The Sixth Sense, which became a runaway success, Shyamalan was quickly inducted into that all too exclusive hall of fame where the director's name becomes one of a film's biggest selling points. Shyamalan followed that up with Unbreakable, which was not as big a success, but received it's share of critical acclaim, then Signs, arguably his best reviewed movie to date and finally The Village, which was greeted by a mixed reaction and a somewhat tepid box-office performance. Now, with Lady in the Water, Shyamalan moves beyond the ground he had previously staked out into a more direct fantasy, although still keeping his feet in reality for the most part. What results is a mixed bag at best, his least engrossing work to date, and one that shows him tipping into borderline self-indulgence.The film is set at The Cove, an apartment building where sad-sack Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is the superintendent to an eclectic assortment of tenants (You know you are watching a movie when there are this many ""colorful"" people living in this close a proximity to each other). At night, Cleveland has been hearing someone swimming in the pool, and he finally discovers that the nocturnal visitor is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), a narf from the Blue World, a mystical other-realm where the creatures are more in touch with a desire not to kill each other in war (this is explained by the helpful pre-title narration). She is at The Cove to meet a particular individual who will be influential in the future of the human world and then return to the Blue World. Her task is complicated by the existence of a Scrunt, a dog-like creature that camouflages itself as grass and will kill Story for reasons that the screenplay makes very complicated. To help her survive and return to the Blue World, Cleveland must interpret a Korean fairy tale that gives some information about the situation and creatures, and determine the right people at the complex who can help save Story.Ever since The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has mixed fantasy and reality to certain degree, always managing to take everyday situations and characters and place them in extraordinary situations. Lady in the Water is not different in this sense, but it is also the first film of his that requires the greatest leap of faith on the audience's part. These aren't ghosts or aliens, these are fantastical beings that are unfamiliar to the viewers, and this time around, Shyamalan doesn't quite sell the fantasy. It doesn't help that some of the creatures, the scrunt and another group of beings named the Tartutic, are somewhat silly looking designs that don't exactly capture your imagination. Also, Story is a rather one-note, uninteresting character, lacking in any depth or interest. Shyamalan believes the audience will root for her just because she is the center of the story (no pun intended), but it just doesn't work.Lady in the Water comes across as his most pretentious film yet, but it also has the double edge of making you believe that perhaps his previous films were also so, and you just didn't notice. It wants to have an ""important"" message, and tries to accomplish this on a number of fronts, from the opening narration to the dialogue of individual characters, but it all reads as almost preachy. Shyamalan pushes this envelope even farther by casting himself as a character in a key role that just screams self-aggrandizement. He is trying to hard to remind the audience that there are ""serious issues"" at the heart of this film, and he's a ""serious"" filmmaker, it's not all just fun and crazy names. But, in some ways this reaction has the fall-out of proving extremely counter-productive to even the memories of his previous works, leading you to consider if his earlier films, with similar ""big ideas"" at their core, were as over-cooked as Lady in the Water and you couldn't see the forest for the trees at the time, without looking back at it with a more even-handed view.Shyamalan also makes the puzzling decision to include a film critic character, portrayed by Bob Balaban, who cannot be viewed as anything other than a swipe at film critics. This is an interesting move on Shyamalan's part, as, except for perhaps The Village, his films have been largely embraced by critics. Did the not stellar reaction to The Village leave a bad taste in his mouth, was he expecting backlash on Lady in the Water, bracing for an onslaught (and if that is the case, what does that say about what he thought of his film). Some audience members will no doubt see this as a necessary response to film critics, but it can't help but look just as self-serving as Shymalan's casting of himself, and again knocks himself down a few notches.But all is not lost in Lady in the Water. Paul Giamatti is once again a pleasure to watch, Shyamalan's continuing collaboration with composer James Newton Howard bores some enjoyable fruit with the film's delightful score, and some of the humor is enjoyable. But, even so, it is still the first package Shyamalan has assembled that has made him look less self-assured than he previously seemed, and perhaps more defensive. When the director starts to sweat, figuratively, on-screen, can audience apathy be far behind?",Lady in the Water
122,ScottDMenzel,"""Lady In the Water"" is M. Night Shyamalan's best film to date for the fact that he dares to create a movie experience unlike non-other.",8,22 July 2006,"When a apartment superintendent named Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) finds a mysterious woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) swimming in his complex's pool after dark, he soon discovers that maybe this woman is not human but a creature from another world. As Cleveland continues to investigate where Story came from he soon realizes that she is from an ancient bed time story and its up to Cleveland to get Story safely back to her own world. A very odd and creative movie ensues Right off the bat I will admit that I was very impressed with M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" and feel that this is without a doubt his best movie to date. I have never really been blown away by anything Shyamalan has done in the past and I never understood the mass appeal of his previous films because while most of them were decent, none in my opinion were as great as most made them out to be. However with ""Lady in the Water"" getting very mediocre or bad reviews, I can honestly say this is probably his best work to date as well as his most creative and most personal work to date. The movie is extremely interesting, humorous, and is very creative and unique. It's nice to see that Shyamalan has finally made a film that came from something he knows well since this whole movie is based on a bedtime story that he told his children.Being a huge fan of Paul Giamatti, it was nice to see him in a silly role. Giamatti is a gifted actor who has been snubbed at the Academy Awards now for the past two years. The man is a great actor who can play the most serious role to the most silliest role and play each role perfectly. He nailed the role of Cleveland Heep on the head. He was weird, mysterious, but at the same time very caring and likable. Also Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderful as Story, she is very good at playing mysterious and weird characters. Most people will complain that the film's acting was pretty poor but honestly I think it was meant to seem like that. This movie wasn't trying to be all serious like Night's previous films. And all of the characters in this movie were suppose to be average apartment residents and not actors. One of my favorite minor characters was Harry Farber (Bob Balaban) who played a bored movie critic. His character was amusing, funny and most importantly very random and I loved every moment he was on screen. This movie had a very bizarre and funny mix of characters all of which were very creative and different than anything Shyamalan has done in the past.As for the film itself I can't really see what any of the critics are complaining about other than the fact that ""Lady in the Water"" does not at all seem like a typical M. Night Shyamalan movie. It seems more like a movie that was made by a completely different director. The acting isn't as serious as most of his films, the story is actually very confusing and complex and finally the film for once (thank god) does not feature a surprise twist ending. With that being said I guess I can see why some may actually turn there backs on this film because it's unlike anything Shyamalan has ever done before and when people see this film they go in thinking oh this is going to be just like Shyamalan's previous films. It's an odd film that only people who want and can still use their imagination will be able to enjoy. I can see how people can say this movie is too weird for them to enjoy and that the film is just too out there to be good. But it's a film that challenges the norm, it dares to be different, it dares to be creative, and it dares to be non-Hollywood. I think it succeeds doing all those things and personally I think its great movie that so few will be able to appreciate. This might be because I like movies that are bizarre heck I love all Tim Burton movies for the sake that he always seems to let his imagination run wild in his films and now it seems Shyamalan has done the same. It's nice to see an alternative Shyamalan movie but maybe the world isn't ready for his imagination to run wild. Personally I loved it and hope this film develops a big cult following that allows Shyamalan to create more movies that challenge the norm.In the end, ""Lady in the Water"" is not like anything that M. Night Shyamalan has done before. If you are a fan of his previous films, be prepared that ""Lady"" is a very different from his other films. There is no surprise ending here and the story is very weird and confusing. To me this is without a doubt his best movie to date even though it's his worst reviewed film. ""Lady in the Water"" dares to be different and I have to give Shyamalan a lot of credit for making a film that really makes it's audience use their imagination and think like a kid again. Go see this movie if you like movies that challenge Hollywood and dare to be different. See this movie for yet another great performance by Paul Giamatti. See this movie if you are tired of seeing the same old thing and yearn for something that dares to be different.MovieManMenzel's Final rating for ""Lady in the Water"" is a 8 out of 10. I highly recommend this film for all of those who like to use their imagination when they watch a movie and don't mind actually being confused when watching a film.",Lady in the Water
123,TheMovieMark,Did the naysayers see the same movie I did?,8,21 July 2006,"""Hey Johnny, I saw where most critics are really bashing Lady in the Water. What do you make of that?"" Most critics are idiots? ""Really? They're saying it doesn't make sense and that it's self-indulgent, etc. Your thoughts?"" Any critic who can't make sense of this film most likely needs to enroll in an ""Understanding Simple Film Concepts"" class. As for being self-indulgent, um, would they care to show me one director who isn't self-indulgent? Steven Spielberg rewrites history in Munich and he's praised as some sort of God-like beacon for world peace. Yet Shyamalan comes along and has el cajones to write and direct a movie the way he wants to and lo and behold, the guy's accused of feeding his ego.And I really don't understand the ""this movie is too far-fetched"" argument. It's called FANTASY, geniuses. E.T., Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter are just so ""near-fetched,"" huh? Try making a real point sometime.I'm not interested in the vendettas some reviewers seem to have against Shyamalan. They decry the lack of originality in Hollywood in one breath and then in the next proceed to lambaste what I consider to be the most original movie of the year. For one reason or another they just have too many axes to grind, Thesauruses to tote, pockets to protect, and girlfriends to not have.What Shyamalan has done is created his own fairy tale, complete with his own original mythology, original creatures, and original characters, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I especially appreciate his ability to incorporate reality with fantasy. Not every savior of the universe has to be a warlock or wizard. Sometimes maybe he's just the crossword-lovin' freak in Apartment 2B.Perhaps this won't be everybody's cup of green tea (now with ginseng), but you gotta give the man credit - he's still coming up with original ideas, making the movies he wants to, ignoring what his critics say, and putting it out there for the people to judge.I also like the cast of characters. What some blowhards might call silly, I call quirky and interesting. Take the dude who works out only one side of this body (Rodriguez), for example. The guy considers himself a scientist who's experimenting, and the results are that his right arm and leg are super muscular compared to the normal-sized (4 1/2 inches smaller) left leg and arm.Some may shake their head and dismiss this as ""too weird,"" but I think it's hilarious, mainly because I've had conversations about this with my friends. We've seriously discussed how someone would look if they only exercised with one half of their body. We've tried to talk each other into experimenting with it. Was M. Night listening in? The thing you'll most want to keep in mind before seeing this is that it really isn't a horror film. If you're in the mood to be scared then you might find yourself a little disappointed, a few jump scenes not withstanding. But what surprised me the most is how funny the movie is. I laughed out loud more at this than most of the ""comedies"" I've seen this year. The scene where Giamatti attempts to convince a Korean woman that he's child-like is particularly hysterical.I don't want to say too much about the story elements because as in all of Shyamalan's movies, the less you know the better (though there are no huge Sixth Sense-esquire twists). It's just a fun, light-hearted, interesting tale about a group of seemingly insignificant people who come to learn that they all have a purpose and a part to play. If that seems like too much of a ""Sunday School"" lesson to some critics then they're more than welcome to head to Wal-Mart and buy a box of Kleenex. It's next to the Industrial-sized nitpickers they love so well.I know a lot of critics are mad because Shyamalan takes a justified swipe at the most pretentious of them (Johnny Betts obviously not being one of the targets). You see, the most unlikable character in the film is a cynical, curmudgeonly film critic who presumes to be so arrogant as to ""know the intentions of another human being."" Most moviegoers, like me, who find that they rarely agree with ""mainstream"" critics will instantly recognize that this character is true-to-life.Weeeeeell, that's not sittin' pretty with plenty of ""mainstream"" critics, and they are accusing Shyamalan of taking ""petty cheap shots"" at them. You know, Mr. Critic, if Shyamalan's portrayal is so inaccurate, then perhaps you'd like to explain why the theater erupted in applause when the guy received his comeuppance? Personally, I recommend lightening up and taking a joke. Or if M. Night's jabs hit a little too close to home then maybe it's time to take up a new residence.",Lady in the Water
124,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: Lady in the Water (2006),3,23 June 2008,"This is the most confusing movie that i have ever seen. When it finished i didn't know what had just happened. All i said was ""huh?"" It did have a couple of good things. It had light laughs and some jump scenes. It also had bad things. It was like the fairy tale that was never told and there's a reason it was never told. It seemed like the director couldn't decide on how to end it.Forget about it being a bedtime story i think the kid would fall asleep before the opening credits. Way too confusing and scary for a kid.I can't believe this came from the guy who made The Sixth Sense. Has he lost it? I don't recommend it.3/10",Lady in the Water
125,board-5,Half serious like The Sixth Sense.,4,5 February 2007,"For me this film was much worst,like Shyamalans earlier works.For example if we talking about the Sixth Sense like that was almost ,or perfect at all,I have to tell you this film for me was just 4-5 out of 10-stars.This is the first time since The Sixth Sense when the fans are separated too.The story is rather a tale like a thriller,or horror,( I mean for the story) ,but the elements are the same:monsters,other worlds.I had a thought after saw this film,like Shyamalan made this film to entertain himself while he knew,the film he making will be the last.(maybe)Aldough this film is not bad ,if we talking about now-daysaverage film-making,but far from The Sixth Sense at quality.",Lady in the Water

Yes, regret that i had given up valuable time to this insipid tripe.Its a straightforward fairytale told in a very punishingly boring way, visually uninteresting, full of its own self importance and its director casts himself as the saviour of the world. Maybe M.Night was letting his feedback from earlier films run away with him.Both myself and my girlfriend watched this film expecting a magical type of adventure but watching this was like looking at a rusty old air conditioning unit for two hours. A dire experience, be warned.",Lady in the Water
127,freaky_dave,A great original idea that doesn't quite make the cut,6,21 July 2006,"After seeing most of Night's films, I would have to say that Lady in The Water is better than the mediocre Village but not on the same par as The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, or Signs.I liked how he went with an original idea of his own instead of copying someone else, but in the future I believe he should let somebody else write the screenplay while he does the directing. Someone else who posted said that he should do a Stephen King story, and I concur. If you would compare their idea's, you would see that they both seem to think on the same wavelength. King is a gifted storyteller, and Night is a very good director. If the two collaborated, I think we would get a very good movie. Here's hoping that's in future plans.Bryce Dallas Howard is Story, a sea nymph from the blue world who has come to an apartment building to bring hope to mankind. In The Village, she was the only character I really liked, and it is no different with Lady in The Water. However, unlike in The Village, she has a supporting cast of characters this time around that aren't boring. That's where we come to the tenants of The Cove(the name of the apartment complex).The tenants, in my opinion, were all quirky and pretty interesting. I enjoyed all of the characterizations, especially Paul Giamatti (Cleveland Heep) who plays the apartment building attendant who is also the handyman that fixes everything that breaks. He is also the one character that saves Story the first couple of times, but then as the plot goes on we find out what she has to be helped by many of the other tenants in the building in order to get home safely. This is after Cleveland discovers that he can no longer help her by himself.It is from here on that the story becomes a little to convoluted. This is where Night should've let a better story teller write the script. We find out more about why Story has come, and we also find out about a nasty creature called a Scrunt who follows her to make sure she doesn't complete her quest of, I guess you would say, enlightenment for the tenants of The Cove and finally all of mankind. I wanted to know more, but Night is unable to give this to us. A better writer would have made this more enjoyable and hence made it a much better all around story.Another thing that I did not like about this script was his use of a movie critic who seems to know what he is talking about (Bob Balaban). Of course he ends up being wrong, and I took this all as a simple strike at critics worldwide who did not like his last movie The Village. I don't mind directors taking swings at their critics, but in this movie, the critic is simply just a tool for Night to take his frustrations out on. We could've done without him.Overall it was nice to see and original idea for once. After all the remakes and sequels vomiting out of Hollywood, this idea was a breath of fresh air. It's too bad that the entire structure of the story didn't quite work.",Lady in the Water
128,ozjeppe,A borderline turkey - exactly what audience is in mind?,3,1 October 2006,"Nothing wrong with fantasy. Nothing wrong with fairy tales. But this way there IS. Exactly what audience did Shyamalan had in mind here? It's not a family tale, since it's probably too scary and plodding for kids. And for us adults, we have nothing but a sloppily written, borderline turkey. Why? Well with this setting, these plot turns and characters - man, it's an unintentional laugh-fest: Narfs? Scrunts? Eatlon? Secret patterns on cornflake boxes? Elements like these had the adult audience chuckling along with me and my friend at practically every scene after 1 hour, shrinking our care for the story (plus ""Story"" herself!) and its characters down to zero. That can't be Shyamalan's intention, I'm sure, as his poke at the film industry & media is also clearly made. Wouldn't an animated version of this story work?!I REALLY like this film-maker; he always carries a good message (and there IS one here, just clumsily presented) and magical visuals, but this one is his most rock-bottom fare to date, and hopefully his last being so. Giamatti is great, though, and the scene where the film critic is killed, rocks! 3 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",Lady in the Water
129,ryan_kuhn,"""Where did you come from?""",6,22 July 2006,"When a writer/director has a resume of five films, certain themes emerge. With Alfred Hitchcock, each movie had an innocent man accused of wrong and other themes that carried through each of his films. Some have said that M. Night Shyamalan is today's version of Hitchcock, which is a rather staggering leap--Shyamalan is only 20 of so films behind Hitchcock. But the one comparison you can make is that Shyamalan's movies tend to have similar themes and motifs: nothing happens by accident and loss. Each of Shyamalan's movies feature a character or characters who have lost a family member and have a specific purpose to the story. Lady in the Water is most similar to Signs, as the story features a character, Cleveland Heap (Paul Giamatti), who lost his family but finds as the movie goes along that he has a purpose to the world he is living in. Giamatti's performance is fantastic, though the character has a speech impediment that I found to be a contrivance and unnecessary. As the superintendent of The Cove apartment complex, Cleveland knows all of the tenants and the ins-and-outs of the complex. One night, Cleveland is checking out a night swimmer, when he falls into the pool. He is saved by a mysterious lady in the water, named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), who we later find out is a mythical creature from an Asian bedtime story. This is where the movie either works for you or doesn't work for you. You can either buy the premise that this apartment complex is the site of a battle between the forces of good and bad, or you will not buy it. This will determine whether you enjoy the movie or not. I bought into the conceit, and thought the movie was entertaining, not nearly as good as The Sixth Sense or Signs, or even Unbreakable, but still better than The Village. The movie does delve into some self-referential material, especially in the movie critic character played by Bob Balaban, and it is cute, though I could imagine some rolling their eyes at the last scene we see Balaban in the movie. Will you enjoy this movie? I don't know, it really is up to the individual movie goer. Will you buy the premise? Will you care about these characters? If you do, you'll have a good time. If you don't, then you just wasted 2 hours of your life.",Lady in the Water

132,bob-rutzel,Doesn't Float,4,10 February 2007,"Apartment Manager, Cleveland (Giamatti) finds a woman in his pool, protects her and gets help from the other tenants to send her back to her fabled world. Ah, so make-believe does meet reality. Thought so. This is, of course, based upon a children's bedtime story and whether actual or made up for this movie, I do not know. But, after listening to some of the goings on in this fable, it's a wonder children would go to sleep and not stay up all night watching for and being afraid of monsters roaming around and bumping into things, and, of course, what is worse: coming for them. Cleveland, who has a most phony stutter, at times, learns the rest of this obscure fable from an elderly tenant (how lucky is that?) and needs to know the whole story to be able to get the woman back to her world, wherever that is; and that won't be easy because, there is something out there, a beast of sorts, just waiting for her to come out of her safe haven, Cleveland's room. The beast doesn't want her to return to her world. There is more of course, but I need you to go to sleep now and we'll take this up tomorrow night. No, there is nothing under the bed. There is hardly anything in here to hold one's attention unless you wanted to know the rest of the story, Paul Harvey. Well, the lady has no clothes on, and I guess that would hold some of us. The acting was fine, and no complaints there. It's the story that needed more work. We should have been told more things and they are still secret. And, since this is a fable interacting with reality, there should have been some magic too. I like magic. Magic is good. Magic would have helped get a better rating from me. The audio was terrible when the lady talked as one could barely make out what she is saying because she utters everything as if in a trance where she is barely whispering (felt like someone should have drowned her because of that). Constant rewind of the DVD and putting the sound up didn't help. They really made you work for the dialogue. I gave up after a while. Okay, I did look under the bed before I went to sleep.

134,Barky44,"A Flawed, But Still Quite Good, Creation of a Modern Fairy Tale",8,6 August 2006,"I feel I've come to understand what M. Night Shaymalan is all about. He is a writer/director who wants to use fantastic stories to reach into the heart and soul of humanity. The best sci-fi writers (Heinlein, Bradbury, Aasimov) have done this so much better than the best fantasy fiction writers. But Shaymalan is giving it a damn good try.His latest movie, ""Lady in the Water"", is one of his better efforts. Set in a Philadelphia apartment building full of oddball tenants, it tells the story of a water nymph (Bryce Howard) who needs help from the quirky residents to return home. Of course it's not that easy, for there are monsters who would rather eat her first.What puts this film beyond a plethora of other, contemporary-setting fantasy/horror movies is the way Shaymalan lets us into the homes and hearts of the human characters involved. He nearly successfully manages to tell us about ourselves through the story of the fantastic. We feel the pain of the building super (Paul Giamatti), and the foibles and misfortunes of all the tenants who found themselves in this lower income apartment block. If you've ever lived in a large, diversely populated apartment building, this film's for you. This is the closest my own apartment life experiences have ever been portrayed (well, except we weren't spending a Saturday night rescuing water nymphs ...).The script slips a little bit here and there. Some parts of the plot don't quite match, you can see the rhetorical ""spackle"" he uses to get over some rough patches. However, none of these misses are enough to derail the film (unlike ""The Village"", which has a plot so asinine you can't possibly think around it). The film does end too abruptly, there is no denouement (and this is a film that needs one).It also has fine production values, and some very good monster effects (the ILM guys really learned something from Peter Jackson's films).8 out of 10, points off for various plot/script slipups. Still a fine movie.Barky",Lady in the Water
135,Pavel-8,Remember that it's a bedtime story.,8,9 December 2006,"Fair or not, specific expectations exist for an M. Night Shyamalan film. For reasons both created by him and thrust upon him, one anticipates a well-crafted film,wrought with tension, filled with complex narratives that drive toward a revelatory conclusion. Until ""Lady in the Water"", he had satisfied those expectations with each film. But anyone who casually expects a story like that here will be sorely disappointed with ""Lady. However those who work to find the proper viewing mindset will be richly rewarded by this narrative about an apartment complex superintendent (an again stellar Paul Giamatti) determining what to do with the narf (a sea nymph, played with aplomb by Bryce Dallas Howard) who emerges from his swimming pool.The first trailer for ""Lady in the Water"" was tagged with A Bedtime Story, by M. Night Shyamalan, a label that caused everyone to raise a skeptical eyebrow. The later advertisements appeared (I avoided watching everything after the first trailer, but did pick up on things despite covering my eyes and plugging my ears) to portray the movie as a more ""typical"" Shyamalan work, replete with scares and high tension. This is unfortunate, because such ads reinforce already false expectations. As the original preview promised, Lady is a bedtime story, and is best viewed and understood as such. Imagine a father gently telling a fairy tale to an eager son sitting cross-legged on his bed, or to a wide-eyed daughter peeking out from under her covers. Imagine the simple entrancement of a child, not fretting over questions like why and how, but simply absorbing the fable-esquire story and its uniquely creative cast of characters. That is the way to experience this film. The film is a little too intense for young children, but one needs to have a child's mindset to best appreciate it.Some will undoubtedly claim that calling the movie a bedtime story is just an excuse for shallow characters and unexplained reasons behind events and people. But those critics miss the point. The type of story isn't an excuse, but rather it defines the movie. Nobody criticizes Aesop for not explaining why the fox was desperately obsessed with the grapes, because the why and how aren't pertinent. While the story of ""Lady"" does lack some of the character depth of Shyamalan's other films, it replaces that handful of intricately defined parts with a bushel of characters who are nearly as memorable despite being painted with broad strokes. Every character can be described with a glance and a couple sentences. That's how children's stories are.Although the movie is a bedtime story (have I made that point yet?), there are lurking subtexts that comment on Shyamalan's place as a writer and his relationship with critics. Depending on one's stance on Shyamalan and his work, he is either poking fun or making grand and extreme statements. These fairly apparent points are definitely open to interpretation and prevent the film from being wholly innocent, but do not remotely weigh the movie down with pretense, allowing the decidedly guileless core of the story to captivate anyone not obsessed with the politics behind the movie.Creating a reality-based fairy tale world on screen is no easy task, but Shyamalan employs a technical crew that understands his film-making style and makes such a challenge seem effortless. Many of the relatively mundane effects (by Industrial Light & Magic of course) are intentionally (?) somewhat hazy, as though seen through the prism of a child's mind. James Newton Howard, who has scored Shyamalan's quartet of films, returns with simple and melodic themes, flowingly accenting various moments without intruding. The methods of cinematographer Christopher Doyle, best known for Asian films like ""Hero"", mesh perfectly with Shyamalan's deliberate approach. Subdued greens and blues dominate the color palette, forming a soft world that matches the storybook tone. Camera angles that vary widely without dizzying match its freshness, and numerous still shots that allow action to wander in and out of frame. All of these factors effectively place the viewer into the apartment complex as the tale meanders along.For the most part, ""Lady in the Water"" lacks the driving mystery of ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""The Village"". The film does not possess the absorbing emotion of ""Unbreakable"" or ""Signs"". With overlapping themes like belief and destiny, it does share characteristics, but not the ones that stimulate the story. At times the movie feels like a serial, like something added to every evening, made up as the story goes. This makes ""Lady"" a bit haphazard as it wanders, but the heavy compelling nature of its predecessors is enjoyably replaced by a lighter sense of wonder that mesmerizes like the story and world of Peter Pan. The reverie of Neverland is not present in these Philadelphia buildings, but the undercurrent of mysticism that runs through the complex is enough to pique the interest of any moviegoer with a heart.Perhaps I'm blinded by my love for Shyamalan's movies. Maybe I've carried this obsession with the film being a fantastic bedtime story too far. Believe that if you like; there is probably truth to it. But I know this: Shyamalan fashions films unlike any other director, and I enjoyed ""Lady in the Water"" as much as anything I've seen this year. With a proper mindset, you can too.Bottom Line: Go in with an open mind, and this will be a uniquely entertaining cinematic experience. 8 of 10, which might be a tad high, but is necessary to counter all the low ratings doled out by jaded critics.",Lady in the Water

138,film_riot,Lady in the Water,6,19 August 2007,"""Lady in the Water"" fascinated me. It always kept my interested and never got boring. I'm writing this because the film got some pretty bad reviews, even worse ones than his previous film ""The Village"". And as I'm thinking that ""The Village"" is his best film to date, the bad reviews didn't keep me from seeing it, but they might have had this effect on many other people. The problem that many reviewers have with Shyamalan's work is that they have wrong expectations. Hey, but that's just my assumption. However, ""Lady in the Water"" has really weak spots on many levels. Firstly, the suspense didn't work for me at all this time. There were no shock moments in this film. Don't get me wrong, it was always interesting, but we've seen far better quality. Secondly this dream world with ""mermaids"" and ""sea monsters"" isn't really my type. And thirdly, also the characters aside Paul Giamatti's stayed rather colourless. All in all a well shot, nice film with good music. That has to be enough this time.",Lady in the Water
139,dhaufrect-1,"The ""Lady in the Water"" is all wet.",1,9 February 2007,"M. Night Shyamalan has directed a film that would better have been left in the water. Paul Giamatti plays Cleveland Heep, a condominium manager who is a jack of all trades. He has a stutter that is only somewhat natural and requires more study from a neurolaryngologist. Bryce Dallas Howard plays Story, a strange brew of a woman who enters the cinema from beneath the depths of the condominium swimming pool where she should have remained. Little expense was utilized in the production of this obviously weak motion picture. There are a few adequate performances by the sub-characters, however, there are literally no redeeming qualities to this two hours of painful to watch cinematic trash. Young-Soon Choi is played by Cindy Cheung and she is convincing, but sadly in a weak show. Even the special effects of the wild wolf like creatures and the hairy monkeys are of little substance. I would not recommend that anyone in his or her right mind waste a minute or a dime on this film.",Lady in the Water
140,w00f,Narf. Scrunt. Plod. Lame.,2,24 August 2006,"Shyamalan is getting worse in a hurry.This is a director who had one great film in him, and that was ""The Sixth Sense."" ""Unbreakable"" was passable. Everything since then has been one awful bomb after another. Shyamalan has reached a true nadir with ""Lady in the Water."" It's heavy-handed, amateurish, and utterly predictable. Who cares if it's based on a bedtime story? This is poor film-making, and the millions of dollars that got dumped into this terrible mish-mash of ""ET"" and ""Splash"" with a few dandruff flakes shed by ""The Lord of the Rings"" sprinkled in for bad measure could have gone to someone who had a good idea for a movie. This certainly wasn't it! I knew this was going to be a long movie when the main character turns out to be something called a ""Narf."" Has Shyamalan never heard of ""Pinkie and the Brain,"" perchance? And then the main character's name is Story, for the love of all things cinematic! The film critic character who tells us precisely everything that is wrong with this very film is a nice touch, and Shyamalan reaches his ultimate self-indulgence when he kills that character off... no doubt his moment of revenge for the panning of his last few toilet-worthy films.The film is called ""M. Night Shyamalan's Lady in the Water"" because there are no top actors in it, so Shyamalan's name is attached to give it some recognition draw. The thing is, there's a good reason why there are no well-known actors in this; anyone who read the hackneyed, atrocious, tedious story and dialog and could find anything else to do went and did it. The characters spew line after line of sickly schlock from their mouths for a solid two hours. There's not a single clever line in the entire film, and this isn't helped when we're treated to words like ""scrunt"" and ""narf"" being chucked about frequently.Even Shyamalan's storied ""twists"" have run dry. In ""The Village,"" the twist was that he misled the audience about the setting of the movie. In ""Lady in the Water,"" he misleads us about who the important characters are, effectively wasting our time following the wrong leads that he's given us for most of the movie. Perhaps we'll get lucky with his next feature and he won't actually be the director! Now *that* would be an enjoyable twist.Whether you're thinking about seeing this in a theater or renting it on DVD, just don't bother. This is a terrible, terrible movie that will disappoint at every opportunity unless you are really into watching a director wallow in his own crapulent narcissism. Perhaps if Shyamalan's movies stop making any money, Hollywood will be forced to find someone new to make a good movie instead of lavishing a big budget on a director who hasn't figured out yet that film is a visual medium, so you don't literally *tell* the story by having your cast talk the whole thing through on screen.""Lady in the Water"" would have been better off drowned in a bathtub.",Lady in the Water
141,counterrevolutionary,Sad and incoherent,4,3 September 2007,"I am by no means anti-Shyamalan. I loved THE SIXTH SENSE, liked SIGNS a lot, and even kind of liked THE VILLAGE (though the twist was so telegraphed that I figured it out the first time I heard the movie's premise).I hated UNBREAKABLE, but that may be partly because I'm an old curmudgeon who thinks that adults who read comic books are some kind of damned subversives. Also, it was just silly.Shyamalan is a remarkably talented filmmaker. Even here, his ability to use cinematic techniques to achieve the effects he wants is notable.Sadly, all this talent is wasted in the service of a muddled and mindless story of a pathetic naked chick named Barf who lives in a swimming pool, some pig-dogs with grass for fur, and big monkeys made out of turmeric. Or something.I've read several reviews that say that it seemed like they were making it up as they went along. Those reviews are accurate. That is precisely what it seemed like. The story proceeds with no rhyme or reason. Shyamalan did not bother to create a coherent world or set of rules. He clearly just made it up as he went along, inventing whatever he needed to make the plot go a certain way.Giamatti and Balaban give good performances, and as I say, Shyamalan's talent manages to shine through in places, in spite of the utter stupidity of the film. Nothing else here deserves praise, though I would like to single out Bryce Dallas Howard's insipid performance for special condemnation (to be fair, this is at least as much Shyamalan's fault as Howard's). To be perfectly honest, I was hoping the big grass pig-dog would rip her to shreds.And then I was hoping it would go after Shyamalan's own character, a pseudo-Messiah whose ideas will form the basis for a total reconstruction of society. You know, like Marx. Or Hitler.I think that politically, Shyamalan is perhaps, shall we say, a bit naive. No, let's say ""stupid""; it's less tactful, but more accurate.Hopefully Shyamalan will pull himself together after the deserved critical pasting this film took. Maybe, for example, he should stop writing his own screenplays, or at least get some collaborators to keep him from going off the rails to the extent he does here.",Lady in the Water
142,Craig_McPherson,Splish Splash investors are taking a bath,4,21 July 2006,"I wonder if, after taking in M. Night Shyamalan's The Lady in the Water, Haley Joel Osment's character from The Sixth Sense might be inclined to say ""I see lousy films, and one of them is in this theatre."" Actually, calling The Lady in the Water ""lousy"" is too simplistic. The movie is more of a train wreck, with partially realized elements, loose ends aplenty, and wildly improbable leaps in its own narrative. And yet, in true Shyamalan fashion, the movie commands viewer respect in spite of its flaws.Shyamalan credits the movie's plot to a bedtime story he created to entertain his children, but instead of conveying a simple story, the tale unfolds as a muddled new age fable that never really goes anywhere or accomplishes anything.The movie's greatest strength is the casting of Paul Giamatti as Cleveland Heep, the stuttering schlep caretaker of a Philadelphia apartment complex known as The Cove. Giamatti's everyman quality makes it easy for the viewer to quickly get sucked into the story, which involves Heep's discovery of a mysterious woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) one night in the complex's pool. Turns out this ""Narf"", or water nymph, has been sent from the ""blue world"" to the world of men to impart some sort of mystical knowledge that the film never makes very clear. Trying their best to kill her before she fulfills her mission are shadowy, supernatural ""Scrunts"", large hyena-like creatures comprised of grass and earth.Sounds strange? Watching the film doesn't help as Shyamalan never bothers to explain why the Scrunts are out to kill his heroine, much less the grand importance of her mission.In the decade that's passed since Shymalan burst onto the scene with his brilliant The Sixth Sense, the director has cultivated an equally proportioned number of fans and detractors. Few movie directors have been able to so totally polarize movie going audiences into love him or hate him camps as Shymalan. A lot of this has to do with his penchant for building his movies around plot twist device that fans either love, or find hackneyed.As if listening to his critics, Shymalan has eschewed his traditional plot twist this time out in favor of a more conventional narrative, albeit one that more closely resembles a phone conversation with a really bad connection. The whole experience actually left me wishing for a twist that would turn the movie on its head and make me feel like everything I'd spent the last two hours watching was much more than the sum of its ambiguous parts.Still, for all its numerous flaws, The Lady in the Water is still a compelling film. Shymalan's talent for imagery, characterization and musical scoring all give this movie a watchable dimension. I also have to admire him for his vision, for unlike many of his directorial contemporaries, he hasn't opted to ""sell out"" and cash in by helming any one of Hollywood's countless superhero action adventure popcorn movies that fill the cinemas each summer. He has a vision and stands by it, even unto failure. There's something to be admired in that.",Lady in the Water
143,troy-daniel-bush,SNORE!,2,24 July 2021,"One of the most frustratingly boring movies I've ever watched.Yeah, Shyamalan had his head up his ass when he made the decision to cast himself as the writer who would change humanity for the better. As well as the arrogant, pessimistic movie critic.It felt like Shyamalan went with the first draft of the script and just made stuff up as he went along. How are you supposed to take any of the mythology seriously when creatures are called stuff like, ""Narf"" and ""Scrunt""? All of the mythology makes zero sense. The main girl's name is ""Story."" Seriously? None of the dialogue sounded natural at all. The plot is full of holes. And the characters make decisions that make about as much sense as the mythology.The direction was nonexistent. There were several shots in this movie that just didn't feel thought out. Shyamalan just couldn't see anything from inside his own ass.There were some awful editing choices.The cinematography was amateurish and pretentious. There were several one-takers. It felt like he did them just for the hell of it.The Oriental girl and her mother were so grating! And they existed solely for exposition. It's super convenient that they knew everything.What the hell was that acting like a child scene? Are you kidding me, Shyamalan?All of the actors suck except for Paul Giamatti because of course he doesn't. I got the feeling Bob Balaban was trying but he had nothing to work with.I'll admit, I don't mind the idea of a fish girl or whatever she was magically appearing in a pool. I feel like there are places you can take that. Namely, a better fairy tail than this!",Lady in the Water

It subtly mixes the mundane and the magical, with a sprinkling of humor and wry self-examination. The twist ending that is usually present in M Night's other movies is notably absent here... what you see is what you get.If nothing else - see it for an incredible performance by Paul Giamatti.",Lady in the Water
145,jaddison383,Nothing Short of Inspiring...,8,15 April 2007,"M. Night Shymalan has become renowned for his ability to write and direct the movies that others are not brave enough to make. He writes stories that challenge us, frighten us, move us, and ultimately change the way we view our lives.Lady in the Water is his best movie yet. None of the others compare.Cleveland Heep is the caretaker of an apartment complex called The Cove. He knows and cares for just about everyone in it, though, in reality, none of them truly know him. He lives an average and normal existence everyday. Then, one night, he finds a young girl named Story in the swimming pool, and his life changes forever. She is a Narf, a sea nymph, who, like her friends, has been sent to awaken man and help them once again. Now, she needs to return home- and evil creatures called Scraunts are seeing to it that she never does. Story will need the help of many of the people at The Cove, none of whom are prepared for it. What none of them realize is that they may need her just as much as she needs them. She may be something much more special than they ever imagined.The cast is astounding. Paul Giamatti is Oscar-worthy as Cleveland, the secretly grieving man who takes Story in. Bryce Dallas Howard is also touching as Story, the unsure and nervous nymph that unites them all. The rest of the ensemble is all wonderful, in particular Cindy Cheung, Sarita Choudhury, and the always-wonderful Bob Balaban.And the music, the music! James Newton Howard's amazing sound should win Best Score. The music soars and sweeps beautifully throughout the entire film, centering on a melody that will haunt you for weeks.In the end, though, it is M. Night Shymalan's incredible story that makes this picture what it is. He has never been short on good stories, but this one is his best. He teaches us about purpose, a subject that many people struggle with in their day to day lives. Things change. Things go wrong. Heartbreak happens. But you still have a purpose. Even if you never see it, you are where you are for a reason. Every character in this film doubts themselves. They all have problems, they're imperfect- but they are needed. Without one of them, all would be lost. The most beautiful scene in the entire film is when Story talks to Cleveland about her purpose... and her doubts. It will move you to tears. Several parts of this film will. It's absolutely beautiful. One of the best films of it's year. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",Lady in the Water
146,samseescinema,Flounders,5,27 July 2006,"Lady in the Water reviewed by Sam Osbornrating: 2.0 out of 4So I'm late to the party where critics nationwide maim the likes of M. Night Shyamalan. My tardiness, I suppose, is due to the fact that I was the one lonely critic who liked The Village. It was clever, I thought, and successfully brooding in style and tone. I bought into it, which is not something I can say about Shyamalan's latest picture Lady in the Water. The film, his seventh, lacks any of the unseen menace from Signs and begets almost none of the shivers from The Sixth Sense. There was awe to Unbreakable and that quiet brooding from The Village. Lady in the Water has wolves covered in grass, big monkeys and a half-naked girl. Sounds like a Michael Bay film, not something from M. Night Shyamalan. The story is easily the most far-fetched of Shyamalan's bunch. It involves a world of water and a world of land. Humans occupy the land world and have drifted farther and farther away from the world of water. But the nutty little mermaid nymphs of the water world want a reunion to bring peace back to the world of land. So out from the drain of an apartment complex's pool comes Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), scaring the daylights out of the landlord, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Taking her under his wing and listening to her bizarre, simple sentenced tale, he learns that she is in fact from the world of water. Asking around the tenants, Cleveland finds a Chinese bedtime story that matches the Story's tale. Without giving too much away about the big monkeys and wolves covered in grass, Cleveland learns that if the right sequence of events occurs, Story could make a significant change in the human world, er.the land world in Shyamalan-speak; just as long as she doesn't get eaten by the land and water world's eternal enemy. For as complicated as it seems, Lady in the Water is no more complex than what it touts itself as: a bedtime story. And this is its largest problem. The issue isn't in the absurdity of Shyamalan's tale because, seriously, how many of his plots aren't absurd? No, the issue with Lady in the Water is that it never comes to a boil. The tale is simplistic and undercooked. There's very little mystery to be puzzled, and no twist to speak of at the end (a fact much publicized already). The great potential for menace is smeared clear over with the large helping of anti-climactic encounters with the wolf creatures and the naked mermaid-thing, Story, is so boring that she makes the drones from The Village look as nutty as circus freaks. It's a clever idea--bringing a bedtime story to the unimpressive realities of middle-class apartment lifebut only if the bedtime story can invoke some real excitement. Shyamalan holds the thrills at bay to make room for slower, more profound material. Problem is, profundity never figures in to Lady in the Water. Shyamalan hints at a deeper meaning, showing images of war and disenchantment with the current state of international politics. He even lays a significant element of the bedtime story in the hands of world-weariness, but in the end refuses to let his theme materialize. All we're left with is that silly bedtime story, sans thrill factor. The only card truly played is that of Paul Giamatti's. Time and again he's proved his acting bones without Academy recognition (and he won't be getting any here), but Mr. Giamatti is an incredible, really incredible actor. Shyamalan is no stranger to strong characters, especially the downtrodden middle-aged man, and his work with Giamatti's character, Cleveland Heep, is a shining star among ashes for Lady in the Water. Giamatti's co-star, Bryce Dallas Howard, hardly deserves mention since her role could be played by a nine year old. Droning lines with wide eyes was never difficult, so needless to say, the talented Ms. Howard does fine. Supporting work by Jeffrey Wright, Sarita Choudhury, and Shyamalan himself are all quite good, too. And so it isn't the acting that's Lady in the Water's problem; nor is it the camera work or pacing or direction. For M. Night Shyamalan has already proved that he's a swell director with the talent to sometimes be great. But Shyamalan is an easy target for us critics and it seems he's fed up with it. Lady in the Water is a film that shows him floundering with his career and wanting to be or make something different. He even creates a film critic character, Mr. Leeds (Bill Irwin), just so he can kill him off in the most theatric manner his film will allow. It's a show of frustration and zany vendetta. But the man's typical formula of the scare-and-twist movie is changed as well, looking for something the same but, as usual, fundamentally different. He even acts a major role in the film, a role that has prophetic importance. Shyamalan seems to be reaching for something beyond scary movies, something he's hinted at before but hadn't lunged for. Well, he's lunged for the profound and found only a couple scraps of shredded paper. With his next project, he'll have to choose a direction. We'll just have to wait and see. But if it's the mass of critics hating his films that's bothering him, somebody should remind him that Alfred Hitchcock, surely one of his role models, didn't find critical welcome until about 1968, forty years after his career started.",Lady in the Water
147,maxmages,This film is an absolute mess,2,27 March 2019,"This film is an absolute mess, the story is ridiculous, the characters are silly, the pacing is terrible, the camera work is boring, the ideas are stupid and the acting is subpar. Shyamalan's Ego just oozes on the screen but he does not seem to have thought through his ""great ideas"".
Maybe it does work as an actual bedtime story for children.
However if you make a real movie for people older than four years, you'll have to work harder.
I know of course that criticism can hurt and that there are enough people out there who do not criticize but just insult but m night Shyamalan is someone who also gets good reviews and even his worse movies had actually always gotten good reviews if you over Excite bad reviews then you should first ask yourself why you get so much negative criticism because we must not forget: ""Nice hair"" is also criticism.",Lady in the Water
148,MrBiddle,He's the guardian!,10,19 July 2006,"You can go in expecting the typical ingredients of a Shyamalan film and find them. By typical, I don't necessarily imply tired or clichéd or annoying. Yes, expect all these ingredients plus the multi-layered narrative that Manoj always has in his films. While in no way does this surpass his period drama ""The Village"", it is very entertaining, where one can experience more humor - and please don't run, also more screen time for writer-director Manoj who doesn't cameo but actually appears as a co-STAR, a writer and one of the integral characters to the plot.Newton Howard's scoring is less effusive and melancholic than in The Village, - his previous collaboration with Shyamalan, but it is nonetheless still enchanting, uplifting and suited to the genre and nuances of LADY IN THE WATER. The acting is nothing short of superb, Giamatti and Howard portray the emotions with the appropriate intensity called for. Yes, there are no big reveals in ""Lady"" but expect a lot of twists - little twists in this one that are very well foreshadowed in the many parts that Night tells his story softly and gently. As he said once, you might want to lean in to absorb the subtleties and essential plot elements carried out as exposition in the dialogue. I especially loved the twist involving the arrogant critic, it was foreshadowed NOT earlier, but contained within the scene of his evident and inevitable demise. There is a lot of grim humor and tense laughter that ""Lady"" does inspire, a trick that Shyamalan has mastered ever since ""SIGNS"" in 2002.Amazing, visually stimulating and fiendish cinematographical acrobatics are to be expected from the way Night uses his camera in Lady in the Water. The usual Shyamalan trademark reflection shots are around - and try watching that washing machine close-up sequence and see if it doesn't raise your hair. Manoj excels in framing his story for the cinema screen, and in addition you will also be treated to wickedly ""claustrophobic angles"" that but enhance the tension, and some ""objective"" camera moves that put the audience with more superior knowledge than the movie's characters - evermore adding up to the suspense in the movie's key fright moments. Coupled with these exhilarating scares are moments of drama, in which Manoj may have succeeded in putting the right amount moments that could elicit tears or even emotional response from the audience.A woman behind me in the cinema would have wanted more defined denouement as the movie concludes, but evidently those who want everything concise may rejoice as Shyamalan, as also the writer himself takes us out of there when the main plot, or core of the story has been resolved. I especially LOVED one of the last shots from under the pool, the event of which it depicts I will NOT divulge as you have to see it. It is extremely sentimental, heartbreaking and bittersweet, that and the rest of the ending. You will see a lot of thrills and showdown as the movie prepares itself to close, and James Newton Howard's music as usual combines the ominous melodies with the uplifting cues, the score gracefully flexing it's muscle to accentuate the spellbinding tale of Shyamalan.If you keep an open mind, free from bias from the Shyamalan signature in movie-making, LADY IN THE WATER has much for the moviegoer to enjoy, and remember for a long long time.",Lady in the Water
149,MovieZoo,Lady In the Water - treading without getting wet.,7,22 July 2006,"This is a review and its intention is express my opinion and to make some points that will help you decide if you want to see this movie.Take that sentence and you will get an idea of how Shyamalan presents this movie. He tells you this is a movie and lets you know what he is going to do with it and then counts on you to apply your imagination(if you want to).In a way I think this movie was ingenious but I did leave the theater bothered. I remember when the teaser came out. I heard Josh Groban singing a song that was quite dreamy so I had the impression this was going to be a fantasy even though people were talking about this being a scary movie. So leaving the movie confused should be understandable because it initially was not clear what we were going to get. Having seen it, I am still not sure what we got. I only saw it once and will likely not see it again. If I see it again, it will be on the DVD. Why? Because I am confused and I did not get enough incentive to unravel the mystery.Shyamalan was able to get laughs out of me when I was trying to figure out what he was doing. So that helped trivialize discontent. His off-the-cuff and nearly subliminal commentaries were interesting and sometimes comical. I could be wrong but one such scene seems to be a cheap shot at a scene in Woody Allen's Match Point (Scarlett Johanssen's character and the boyfriend's scene in the rain talking about love). Why would Shyamalan do that? I have no idea. That was just one of the unusual moments. Others were not so vague.Shyamalan had a lot to show and tell here but I am not sure he told it right. I think it is entirely possible he is taking advantage of the viewer. On the other hand he may not be doing any of this for the viewer. He could be so entirely self-confident that what he is doing is just expressing himself, not caring what anyone thinks. What a way to make a living!! All in all, this movie is less of a mystery than Shyamalan himself. As I was disappointed with every movie of his since 6th Sense, I was not surprised with the outcome of this movie. However, this is not a movie to be missed if you are a fan of his or his style.I rated this movie higher than you might think, 7 of 10. The movie has some good comic relief and has its fair share of beauty. The movie, as confusing as it is, has a true interest factor. Shyamalan's movie being quite different than the mainstream features deserves high marks. Being as slow as it was, you are given time to absorb, but this sponge had absorbed too much at the half way point. I had lost interest in the movie but wanted to decipher the message. Now, if anyone can tell me what this was all about, I may give it a slightly higher mark. I might even want to see it again.Expect mystery, scary moments, comic relief, boring times, Shyamalan, unnecessary dialogue(I think), creatures, Shyamalan, and more Shyamalan. Oh yeah, The Lady In the Water??, Giamotti was in the water more often than she. Hmmmm, maybe this was a movie about some guy's underlying desire to be a woman.7/10 and that's as clear as I can make it.",Lady in the Water

151,etsm92,A stupid fantasy with just a few highlights... What happened to you Shyamalan?,5,29 July 2006,"Lady in the Water/2006/**Main Stars: Paul Giamatti Bryce Dallas Howard M. Night Shyamalan Cindy CheungI'm sorry Mr. Shyamalan But ever since your previous film The Village (which was one of the first three amateur reviews I wrote), you haven't shown any sign of improvement and probably never will. After this mediocre performance, my doubts go even further. Let's just face it everybody; his talents are lost and floating in midair somewhere. Will he ever catch them and revive himself with them? I don't know. I observe. I remain loyal to his films even if they are mediocre like this and The Village was. Because who knows when a good story finally pops into his mind and he decides to pop it onto the screen? He made three good films that he both wrote and directed. And they were The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. However mediocre his two next films were, they obviously had SOME originality to them. And in this one, the characters were original and so was the cinematography in select scenes as in all his movies. The characters were actually HUMOROUS! And you wouldn't expect humor from Shyamalan. You would expect horror, mystery, suspense and, in this one, stupid fantasy. Combine all those together along with humor in this film and you get one pretty whacked up story. Surprisingly, most of the laughs came from the main character, Apartment Superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) mainly because of his stuttering. He also had some funny facial expressions and had to act like a kid to convince a grandmother of this young Chinese woman to tell him a bedtime story. THE bedtime story that caused this slightly stupid movie to be made The young Chinese woman is named Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) and has to translate the story from Chinese to English in order for Heep to understand. Heep has to understand it in order to give the information to the mysterious lady in the water that came out of the water to meet him. Her name is Story and has come to remind humans that underwater creatures can still communicate with each other and that humans aren't in a different world. However, many people believe that. When she is done with her deed, if she finishes at all, she needs to find a way back to HER world and not stay stranded on the human world till she dies. The bad thing is the creatures of the deep, ones specifically called Scrunts, may try to find a way to permanently mark the destination she stays in. Either she finally has done her job and returns back to her world, or she stays in the human world forever and never returns. The story was a drag and droned on until the final fadeout which was the wrong time for one. They should have had more to it because I would like to see something I may enjoy in the film beside the cinematography and humorous characters. Maybe a twist ending? I didn't spot one. Come on Shyamalan, before you stupefy the entire world with how mediocre your films have been lately, can't you give us just one last farewell film that will actually show us you're still a talented director? Can't you show us what you used to show us? A better story, longer, and smarter. This film was original, humorous, had some interesting characters, good cinematography in select scenes. Where is the story? The gist? The main point? It's not showing Shyamalan shows us more of another movie idea than a complete feature film. He should still be in his thinking process thinking of a film that is BASED on this idea and that will have more than just the idea. I only saw scattered brainstorming scenes instead of an entire story. Ya did well with the characters, cinematography, and humor. Now ya need a better story Shyamalan. Movie directed by M. Night Shyamalan.",Lady in the Water
152,Adorable,This is the World and You're Invited,8,21 August 2006,"Growing up as a wonder child of the euphoric late 90's hasn't been kind to Mr. Shyamalan, with that heyday's ultimate subsidence coming also his own decline. But declinations arrive in many iterations, and his remains one of box office and trend, for no matter how much the water cooler crowd (and perhaps a reviewer or two) no longer look to M. Night for cerebral titillation, the guy is still one of the world's premier movie makers. Lady in the Water, latest offering from the immense talent, proves that point amply.For this humble movie watcher, Shyamalan's first two forays, the ones that have won him humongous popular acclaim, are not the greatest items in his workbook. Both Sixth Sense and Unbreakable failed to win me over. Conversely, the two latter releases, Signs and The Village, so often derided by those same people who put M. Night on a pedestal back in '99, did manage to click, and awoke me to the conduct of a maestro.This theme finds a new home as Shyamalan again goes into the breech of emotion mixed with fear, ditching for the time being his trademark surprise endgame twists. In that regard, Lady reflects Signs, steering away from the formula last seen in The Village.Probably for those interested in shock value and gimmicks this cancels Lady as a plausible precept, but look closer and you quickly find a parable of superb, delectable relevance to our lives and times, as well as some biting commentary.Following fairy tale or bedtime story standards, the core plot line revolves around reclusive apartment building custodian Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), on a protracted exile from past traumas. Having had a major calamity befall him a la characters from The Village, Heep adheres to maintaining normalcy in the small community, known as The Cove, although it too is no safe haven: the film does great in revealing several everyday horrors of apartment living.The mood and serenity of The Cove, made apparent by clever close-shooting and having no outside world, eventually cease when Heep encounters aptly-monikered Story, a mermaid or siren-like being (Bryce Dallas Howard of The Village) on a mission to save humanity from an existence bathed in suffering and conflict. Of course, malicious forces are bent on stopping salvation from ever taking place, lurking in the woods and shadows, waiting for an opportunity to destroy Story and her kin. These demonic beasts are rendered quite well courtesy of Lady's rather nominal computer graphics quotient, generating the movie's few scary moments. Abetted by startling sound effects, this likely explains the PG-13 rating, for otherwise there's no language or anything else of a saucy disposition.As the fable progresses, Heep relies increasingly on a coalition of residents embodying the goodness in humankind. Some provide high-caliber performances, in particular Cindy Cheung as comically sardonic dynamo Young Soon. Cheung's prowess is so apparent there's no need to analyze it, only shame being we haven't seen more of her before, save for scant TV work. Jeffrey Wright puts in his spectacular two cents as a wordy puzzle-solving dweller, while director Shyamalan goes for cost-cutting by taking on a full role instead of the usual Hitchcock cameo.Other usual ingredients from his previous titles do keep faithful to ancestral precedence, such as camera angles, reflections, themes and distinctly evolutionary unfolding of events. Though at times slow and protracted, Lady in the Water results in moments of pristine sentiment guaranteed to get a reaction. At the end, it's essentially a metaphor or allegory for the state of the world, backstory coming sporadically via ominous television news broadcasts glimpsed here and there, telling of war, suffering and desperation.It may be slightly hard to get into the characters in Lady, but as a collection of intelligent components that nevertheless bring along their emotive siblings, the film works wonders.It's a sweet story overlaying a collage familiar to most but still formidably strange, and testament to spendthrift acumen from Shyamalan. The adept's refusal to fall back on a final punchline merely emboldens Lady in the Water, cementing its commitment to simple storytelling without the proverbial cheap tricks.Rating: * * * *",Lady in the Water

154,Tin Man-5,Only truly talented filmmaker could make a movie this bad.,3,23 July 2006,"I have enjoyed every previous Shyamalan film, from ""Wide Awake"" to ""The Village."" But this one was totally out of control.Those who defend it say that you must get into the correct mood for it - you have to see it as a bedtime story. But children aren't stupid - how many kids do you know who could sit through a story like this being told to them without asking, ""Why...?"" every ten seconds? It seems like Shyamalan didn't have answers, so he kept inventing them as he went along, with plot constantly piling on top of itself faster than he could maintain it. The greatest bedtime stories are simple, interesting, and imaginative (Wizard of Oz, E.T., Mary Poppins). This one is so confusing and self-indulgent that I simply think that Shyamalan lost control of his ideas. He should have scaled down.Shyamalan has blasted film critics for liking ""Signs"" (his best film) and flogging his other work (which I guess means only ""The Village"" - all his other films got good reviews, did fine at the box office, and/or were nominated for awards). He said on his NPR interview, ""They like my popcorn film, but they get upset when I try to make a film that has a message."" Paradoxically, ""Signs"" has a GREAT message (looking for signs and meanings in all little subtle banalities of life), but I can't for the life of me figure out what message (if any) ""Lady in the Water"" has. OF COURSE we don't mind if you make a movie with a message, Mr. Shyamalan. Just tell it well.It takes a truly inspired filmmaker to make a film this ambitiously bad. I believe ""Lady in the Water"" is the ""Zardoz"" of our generation.",Lady in the Water
155,stevetseitz,ambitious but ultimately unsuccessful,6,30 July 2006,"Marketing is a big part of any movie. I have seen this movie marketed as a horror film and as a human story. When the viewer goes to a movie with certain expectations it is difficult for a film to be all things to all people. M. Night Shyamalan has created a few masterpieces in his short career. With this film he takes elements of ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"" and gives them a twist.He places a deeply human story within the strange confines of a ancient story book complete with innocent nymphs, fantastic creatures and magical powers, all this inside a slightly dilapidated apartment complex. I found Giammatti's excellent performance to be slightly reminiscent of a Richard Dreyfuss everyman circa 1975. This is perhaps intended...after all Shyamalan is sort of the new Spielberg: Hollywood's creative golden boy outsider.In this film Shyamalan makes a few major errors. He doesn't play it totally straight. He has a few too many winks and nods at the audience. He breaks the ""fourth dimension"" in at least one instance by having a character speak directly to the audience.In ""Signs"" we had a similarly moving human story with a similarly far-fetched plot, but it seemed to work. Here it's too much of a stretch for the audience and so much of what is a well crafted film falls flat. The premise MUST work.I also wasn't a fan of the over-the-top performance of Cindy Cheung which almost played like a stereotype from an old Warner Bros. cartoon.There are a few goose-bump inducing ""Shyamalan"" moments which make you jump, but true horror fans will be disappointed by the lack of gore.By contrast, those looking for a human story about a damaged man finding his worth and companionship might be dismayed by the horror/fantasy elements.",Lady in the Water

157,Robert_Hearth,"""This Is Like A Scene Out Of A Horror Movie."" --- Harry Farber (Bob Balaban)",4,6 March 2007,"""Lady in the Water"" (2006) Directed By: M. Night Shyamalan Starring: Paul Giamatti, Bryce Dallas Howard, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban, Sarita Choudhury, Cindy Cheung, M. Night Shyamalan, & Freddy Rodríguez MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for some frightening sequences) M. Night Shyamalan has become quite the famous director since 1999. His first major project was ""The Sixth Sense"" and it is still one of most shocking and twisted horror films to have been produced by Hollywood in the past twenty years. ""Unbreakable"" came one year later and showed that Shyamalan was not a one-trick pony. After that, ""Signs"" came in 2002 and was met with just as much critical praise and just as many fans. In 2004, Shyamalan returned to the director's chair with ""The Village"". Critics didn't show much love for this movie audiences seemed to be split. Some really enjoyed it and others found it to be dull and ridiculous. I was in the middle. I thought it was an intriguing movie that was very creative, but that it was marketed incorrectly. Even still, it did not live up to Shyamalan's other films. Next came ""Lady in the Water""Shyamalan's bedtime story. From the trailer and the previews, everything seemed to be in place for Shyamalan to revive his career with this moviebut, when critics ignored it, my heart sank. Was this movie one that would finally seal Shyamalan's career as being average, rather than superb? Or could it possibly be the one that would prove that he had what it took to thrive in Hollywood? ""Lady in the Water"" tells the story of apartment superintendent Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) whose tenants are an odd and diverse group of people. One night, he hears splashing in the swimming pool outside and goes to check. He finds Story (Howard), a narf from the Blue World. All she wants is to return home, but there is a creature--a massive dog covered in grass instead of fur--who wants nothing more than to keep her where she is. Heep will need the help of all of the tenants if he wants to save Story and send her back home. Time is running out for a happy ending. ""Lady in the Water"" has an interesting plot, but it is weighed down by the overly-complicated details. The path to get Story back to her home becomes so water-logged and uninteresting that any intrigue the plot possessed is almost completely lost. What started as a beautiful fairytale became a contrived blah.M. Night Shyamalan has always made brief appearances in his movies. This is nothing new to Hollywood. Alfred Hitchcock did it, as well. But, in ""Lady in the Water"", Shyamalan promotes himself. Now, he is a full-fledged main character and, oddly enough, a very important one at that. I'm all for directors getting really involved in their projects (even to the point of obsession), but Shyamalan is a directornot an actor. It shows here. He didn't sell me at all and stuck out like a sore thumb. He should take a step back, pull in the reigns, and stick to directing, because acting just isn't his thing. His direction is still breathtaking and makes the movie far more beautiful than the screenplay deserves. I suppose that I should be crediting cinematographer, Christopher Doyle, as well, because, let's face it, the cinematography is probably better than the direction. Regardless, Shyamalan has made a visually-beautiful filmnothing more and nothing less. But, if you wrap a two-year old fruitcake up in beautiful wrapping and give it as a Christmas gift, the recipient still won't enjoy that fruitcake.""Lady in the Water"" recently got nominated for four Razzie Awards. Two of those are justified: ""Worst Screenplay"" and ""Worst Supporting Actor -- M. Night Shyamalan"". This movie is nowhere near the ""Worst Picture"" of the year and M. Night Shyamalan is not even close to the ""Worst Director"". This movie plods along, becoming increasingly pretentious and self-absorbed with every scene. It forgets that it has an audience to entertain and makes up everything as it goes along. Only the most gullible audiences would buy the various plot twists and turns. Shyamalan makes his most self-indulgent project yet, proving that he thinks that he can do anything he wants and that audiences will still tune in and watch. I suppose that, to some extent, he is correct. However, Shyamalan had better watch out. With ""Lady in the Water"" barely surpassing its budget (in worldwide grosses), I believe that it is clear that audiences are not going to keep coming back if he doesn't improve with his next film. Sure, it's visually-arrestingbut it's about as boring and contrived as they come.Final Thought: There is a reason ""Lady in the Water"" is called a bedtime story.Overall Rating: 4/10 (C+)",Lady in the Water
158,flickershows,The Embarrassing Decline Of M. Night,4,15 August 2006,"I tried to explain the plot of Lady In The Water to someone at work and got a little red-faced in the process. The whole thing is kind of embarrassing. If M. Night Shyamalan wants to be a brand name (and he DOES seem to think he's Hitchcock Jr.), then he can't go around making movies this stupid. You want to go with the fairy tale motif and make up goofy names for silly characters, okay. If you do it right, audiences will buy anything. I can't imagine too many people will buy the ""narfs"" and ""Tartutics"" and ""scrunts"" and other tomfoolery in this film, though. And since I started laughing during my explanation of the plot to that friend at work, there's no point in going into great detail about any of it now.Okay, fast version. Naked girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes out of the pool of a run-down apartment complex. The stammering, tortured superintendent (Paul Giamatti) tries to help her get back to the land of make-believe. Or something like that. The multicultural tenants in Giamatti's building also have a preordained role in helping this girl survive attacks by vicious wolf-type creatures...just as we all, by George, have a role in helping to mend this cockeyed world of ours. Oh boy. At least Giamatti does well in finding nice shades to his character and doesn't overdo the emotion. Howard is asked to do next to nothing except look pale and frightened. Bob Balaban plays a jerk film critic who gets some savage comeuppance. (Very subtle, Night.) And the director himself plays a unappreciated writer with huge things ahead in his future. (Even subtler!)This dud and the catastrophe that was The Village prove that Shyamalan needs to find a good producer and let that person help him shape his set pieces into a film that doesn't cause unintentional laughter. And he REALLY needs a new visual F/X company because the bad guys in his last 3 films have looked ridiculous. We're talking Monty Python type creations here. If he wants us to snicker at his villains, mission very accomplished. There's no doubt that this man has some imagination as a director and as a writer, yet something's been missing ever since he made the seat-gripping Signs. Or maybe he's just out of good ideas and the next project will be more funny than it is thrilling. After Signs, I couldn't wait for the next one. After squirming through both The Village and Lady In The Water, I can wait.",Lady in the Water
159,native_girl333,Creative and Enjoyable,8,27 January 2007,"I was very intrigued to see M. Night Shyamalan's new creation. The fact that the story is based on Shyamalan's bedtime story for his kids is very fascinating.Cleaveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) finds an young woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the pool which he maintains. The girl isn't any normal female. She is a legendary water nymph, one of the mystic creatures that are living in the water. Story has an mission but the task is very dangerous. There is one terrible creature in her way...Bryce Dallas Howard was an excellent choice to play the innocent-looking Story. I have noticed this certain pattern that Shyamalan has in his film-making. He recycles the actors in his films. For example Bruce Willis starred in two of his movies, Joaquin Phoenix has appeared in his productions twice and now Bryce Dallas Howard has performed two roles for him... Maybe Paul Giamatti will be cast to Shyamalan's next film? He might create a story's character based on the appearance and habits of the actors he likes. In ""Lady in the Water"" Shyamalan himself makes a more bigger role than he is used to.Although ""Lady in the Water"" has been a flop it is still magical and enjoyable. I always admire a person who has his own voice and vision of doing anything creative. M. Night Shyamalan has a really vibrant imagination, indeed.",Lady in the Water
160,Pasafist,"Whether your reaction is confusion, anger, or awe, this film cannot be easily ignored.",10,21 July 2006,"Has M. Knight Shyamalan lost his mind? Is he a mad genius or just loopy? Has he created a masterpiece or a mess? These are the questions I'm still grappling with after watching THE LADY IN THE WATER. This is most interestingly beautiful, confusing, and downright strange films I've have ever seen. Wow, trying to come up with words to explain what's going on in my mind after watching this film is impossible. I'm not sure if I've seen the future of the cinema or the end of a popular director's career. But I do know that THE LADY IN THE WATER cannot be ignored.I think walking into this film, I had many preconceived notions. I know what an M. Knight Shyamalan film is, or at least what it's supposed to be. But THE LADY IN THE WATER challenges every one of those notions. There's no surprise ending, there are very few scares, and the film feels sloppy, half-hearted, overly confusing, and I understand why most will dismiss it. This is a movie that can't quite be nailed down and since the film bucks any and all convention. It's easy to find the conventional flaws everywhere.The acting is disjointed, the plot is a mess, the dialogue is overly simple, the story is far too complicated and it all combines into something that seems pieced together on the fly. It feels almost as if Shyamalan has drawn a line in the sand. This line is all logic. This line is how far he expects us to go, and then out of nowhere the line suddenly falls apart. Shyamalan pushes us so past the line, it's easy to just give up. I think the line comes at a different point for each of us. The line disappeared to me when the little boy begins to read cereal boxes. It is so weird, so out of left field. This was at that point in which I had to decide if I should give up any semblance of logic and just give in to the sheer absurdity of it, or whether I should give up and pan it. Where that lines falls with you, may decide if you have a positive reaction to the film or not. The plot is simple, or maybe not. A ""Narf"" named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) shows up in a pool at The Cove, and apartment community in Philadelphia. What's a ""Narf?"" Well it's kind of like a mermaid with human feet, or maybe more like an angel or a muse that lives underwater, both would be appropriate. Anyway Story is rescued by The Cove's resident superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Story is looking for a writer who's written work will cause a positive change in the world forever. On that trail Cleveland must protect Story from an evil creature bent on destroying her. But what is this movie exactly? It is a bedtime story come to life. It's a fanciful yarn, a child's story and a wild imagination run amok. Like how MULLHOLLAND DRIVE was dream realized on film, THE LADY IN THE WATER is a campfire tale, it's not a terribly cohesive, and demands that the audience put the pieces together. I liken it to the weird tales I created with my action figures as a kid, or a nonsense story that a first grader may try to write. It's not designed to be pulled apart, just experienced at that moment. None of the pieces quite fit, a lot of times if feels as if the film is grasping for straws. Sensing that it's lost most of the audience it gives into its oddness, and it revels in it. But is that by design?The other side of the coin is that this is a badly made movie. It's the wild ranting of an over zealous personality. The first credit you see as the film comes to a close is ""Written, Produced, and Directed by M. Knight Shyamalan"" and since he's been so successful maybe this film is an example of what happens when you allow a director too much room, and no editorial comment from the studio. Maybe this is a self-indulgent vanity piece, a sloppy mess of a movie that would have been easily dismissed had it not been created by Shyamalan himself. Honestly, I don't know where I fall. I think I want to see the movie again. But I like the notion that this could be a step in the right direction for film as a whole. That Shayamalan has crafted a film that way ahead of its time. I'd hate to realize that there is nothing there because it would rob that odd sense of madcap joy I experienced with the film.THE LADY IN THE WATER is the perfect remedy for what's wrong in Hollywood. Even if you hate every single moment of it, it encourages strong reactions. Whether that reaction is confusion, anger, or awe, this film cannot be easily ignored. So at this moment I think I will argue that THE LADY IN THE WATER is a brilliant film. That Shyamalan will get ribbed for it now, but will later be rewarded with a strong cult following. It's easily the best film I've seen all year.",Lady in the Water
161,sinncross,A bedtime story that will not be forgotten,8,19 August 2006,"As the story goes, Cleveland Heep, a building manager, rescues a woman by the name of Story, only to discover that she is narf, which is akin to a water nymph. She has to make a journey back to her world, but not without the help of specific humans, who are believed to have various powers. With only the tenants in sight, Cleveland goes about rounding up these special humans, so as to help Story to be able to leave the human realm.The Lady in the Water never becomes overcomplicated and as seen in the opening scenes, which resembles drawings done by a young child been animated, the story does have a sense of quirkiness to it, with some light humor added. The story is perhaps the best aspect of The Lady in the Water, because it's not what we're used to these days: a modern bedtime story.Acting is utterly convincing, especially for a fantasy based story embraced in a real-life setting. Bryce Dallas Howard stunningly portrays Story, a water nymph whose wellbeing must be put into the hands of Cleveland Heep, played by Paul Giamatti. Giamatti in return has a virtuous quality of nobleness, and M. Night Shymalan proves that he can act, even if not on an epic level.Music is merely satisfactory, though will surely beat bravely in your heart when the final moments of the film commences. While the music is not consistent, Shymalan proves to be a master of the art of not only storytelling, but directing as well. One will encounter a couple of scenes which seem odd, bit it's this little bit of experimentation on Shymalan's part, which ultimately enhances the effectiveness of the story in its entirety. Also Shymalan does well to contrast the positive imagery surrounded with a bedtime story, with the negative images of war, which is seen whenever a character is watching the television. Of course that's not to say that the story is lighthearted through and through, because there are instances of darkness, but it's never too extreme to detour from the overall atmosphere of the film.There is no apparent twist in the ending of The Lady of the Water, and there needn't be: the charm is connected in the fairytale approach of the film. There are clever nuances of symbolism, which is sure to please avid viewers. While different to previous efforts of M. Night Shymalan, The Lady in the Water is a welcomed addition. Easily one of the better films of the year, The Lady in the Water will truly touch your soul, and is as equally beautiful.",Lady in the Water
162,TheGOLDENWALRUS,"fun movie with comedy, drama, and a little horror",7,23 July 2006,"I was very anxious to see this movie and finally got my chance. Very surprised to see the theater was only a third full. This movie was very original and enjoyable and Paul Giamatti was fun to watch.The movie actually took place in the same place throughout the whole movie. It took place in an apartment with a pool outside. Giamatti's character was a lonely middle-aged man who was bothered by his past but likable to the rest at the complex. He was like their handy man such as the first scene where he is trying to take care of a bug problem. Quickly in the movie the plot unravels as we already see the lady in the water that was played well by Bryce Dallas Howard. Her name is story and she needs to get back to her life but needs lots of help as everyone around the apartment is trying to contribute in some way. Finding the correct role for the people was tough as their strange gifts or talents may not be the correct fit(You will know what I mean when\if you watch this movie).Paul Giamatti was great just like usual. He always seems to play a very likable character in most the movies he is in. Bryce Dallas Howard was also very good at her role but her role was too similar to her role in the VILLAGE. The movie is a pretty good family film. It had no strong language that I remember. Only a few quick chills. It was a pretty correct length. The storyline was a little difficult to follow and yes, lots were thrown in. But this was the fun of the movie. It also had some funny parts.Overall I give the directing a 9, editing a 9, acting a 7, storyline a 6, originality a 8, and music a 9. If you liked the VILLAGE, watch this movie. If you didn't, probably skip this.",Lady in the Water
163,Gambitt,"You had me at ""Narf"" (not)",5,24 July 2006,"It seems that everyone starts out M. Night reviews by stating their personal M. Night history, so here goes: I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is a brilliant, well done movie; I thought ""Unbreakable"" was horrible; I generally liked ""Signs;"" I liked ""The Village"" a lot too. The intriguing thing about M. Night movies is that it's impossible to predict whether or not you will like the movie. Every movie seems to rub every viewer a different way. That's why I'm generally not discouraged if the critics pan one of his movies.In fact I desperately wanted to enjoy this movie. I was willing to give M. Night broad leeway, but instead I was left cold and unconvinced.The biggest problem, from the start, was the lack of any attempt to suspend disbelief. When one creates a movie in which the plot veers off into wild fantasy, how the central characters react is crucial because they are the lense through which the viewer sees the movie. If we are to have any faith in the magic or myth presented, we must be convinced that there is REASON to believe in them.Hence in such movies, you may initially see disbelief and skepticism in the characters themselves followed by some undeniable event or rational revelation, which ultimately convinces naysayers. None of this was present in ""Lady."" Instead nearly ALL the characters accept the ""myth"" as truth without blinking an eye and without exhibiting any signs of intelligence. The myth itself is a bizarre and absurd story like what a sugar-high six-year-old might make up, involving dog-things called ""scrunts"" and a water creature called a ""narf"" (which is what Pinky used to spasmodically shout in Animaniacs).This failure to guide the audience strikes me as lazy storytelling. It's a fantastic way to alienate your viewers and remove all credibility from your characters. Night aggravates the problem by spoon-feeding (rather than showing) the substance of the ""myth"" through the ravings of a comically annoying (and borderline offensive) Korean woman with an equally annoying daughter After an hour, I hadn't yet completely given up. The middle is really where the movie starts to come together, weaving itself into a fantasy-mystery-thriller. A plot about a group of individuals who must figure out how to apply each of their unique abilities and talents in order to save someone is, IMO, a great starting point.But I just couldn't get over how generic, bland, and illogical the execution was here. The ""logic"" used reminds me of Sphere, in which the ""scientists"" reasoned: well, the alien is round like a ball so if we wrap a keyboard around a ball, we can translate the alien's thoughts. The same silliness applies in ""Lady,"" and having every character accept it unwaveringly does NOT make it any stronger of a plot.Having been repeatedly disappointed throughout the movie, it was no letdown when cheesy CGI swept into the film's final minutes. I think M. Night was trying to make a beautiful, melodic bedtime story, but even young, gullible, eager children would be distracted by having to constantly scratch their heads and ask, ""Huh? Say what? Wth?""",Lady in the Water
164,I_Love_Spielberg,Another underrated effort from Night,9,13 August 2008,"""Lady in the Water"" is about a widowed apartment owner named Cleveland Heep who makes contact with a mythical sea nypmh named Story. After making, he begins to witness changes at the apartment complex, things that he's never felt before.Now, unlike Night's other movies, this one has no twist, but I won't give anything away, simply because it's M. Night Shyamalan. Also, I liked this movie a lot. Like ""The Village,"" there's a powerful message in it, and it applies to all of us, and that's what I think people don't get about M. Night Shyamalan; you can't expect another ""Sixth Sense,"" because it just wouldn't be that good. He never does the same movie over again. It's always different.So please, see this movie and make an opinion for yourself.",Lady in the Water
165,the_Poppuns,Loved it.,9,21 July 2006,"I do consider myself to be a fan of Shyamalan's previous work, least of all 'The Sixth Sense', and I am definitely a fan of fantasy films, so maybe this movie is just a perfect fit for me. But to be quite honest, I can't even think of anything to critique or why anyone else would pick at it either. Unless they have cold black hearts.Paul Giamatti is the perfect person to play Cleveland, the maintenance man of The Cove, an apartment complex with an assortment of residents that might seem a little strange but are as real as you and me. He seems a little beat down by life and is very much a caretaker of the inhabitants before the building. Well someone's been swimming in the pool at night and once he finds out who our story gets underway.Now right here is where I fall in love with the movie, because immediately fantastic elements are introduced and Cleveland just goes with it. No incredulous faces, no ""Am I going crazy?""s. He just helps out like he always does. That's my kind of movie. And as other people become involved they all pretty much react the same way. There is no voice of reason, no naysayers, and I'm so happy for that. I'm prepared to move to the Cove right now.Very early in the film it started to remind me of 'The Neverending Story' and I was worried that it would go in a similar direction but it didn't. This to me is the most original movie I've seen in a long time. I'm a Twilight Zone fan and I've heard how M. Night Shyamalan is supposed to be always ripping them off and yet I can never connect a movie of his to a TZ episode as easily as everyone else does. I do think that his creations would make great TZ movies and I suspect that's what he does. He makes his own original Twilight Zone episodes as feature films. If I were a director, I'd probably do the same thing.What this movie has is a hope and spirit that you almost never find anymore. I read a review today that said something to the effect that you'd have to have the mind of a child to buy into this movie (as if that were a negative thing). And to that, I say yes you do. You have to leave the world behind and go along with it. If you can't do that, stay home and watch CNN. You have to believe in magical creatures that can save the world. You have to believe that everyone has a purpose and can do great things just by being who they are.The cast is great all the way. The story is great. Of course his movies look beautiful. And I don't know if you can deal with this, but the movie ends when the movie ends. It's got a real live ending. No epilogues, no twists, no dragging, no final message. So refreshing. And maybe my favorite thing in the movie is that the person who says there is no more originality left in the world gets what's coming to him.I think this movie should be watchable by everyone. The previews make it look a lot scarier than it is. And really it's not scary at all except for the jeopardy of their task not being accomplished. If you're not a fantasy oriented person maybe it's not for you. But if most people can believe in hobbits and elves, I don't see why they can't believe in narfs and scrunts.",Lady in the Water
166,shawnmikedryer,Failed attempt at a true 'twist',5,19 December 2020,"With quite the respectable cast this film tried so hard to be the next great film with a twist but ends up being a muddled misfire. This is apparently a bed time story Shyamalan tells his children which makes sense given the make-it-up-as-you-go unstructured direction this film appears to careen towards. This failed attempt at a well rounded tale does not seem to improve much in the second and third acts get messier as the tale adds a slew of seemingly extra and unneeded as each are supposed to have a meaning and usefulness and several of them seem oddly appearing to be placed to add extra density to an already skinny plot line and doesn't help its case later on. Really unfortunate because the cast looks very promising yet most did not really mesh together. Every moment you went okay this is making sense it goes sideways, it just seemed like Shyamalan literally added certain things as he went to keep the stale unrewarding story afloat.The Cove apartment complex seems like your everyday run of the mill apartment community. Widowed family man Cleveland Heep is this communities superintendent and when thing go wrong he's a lifeline to many of the residents here. One night he wanders upon a mysterious young woman while responding to a call of someone swimming in the pool past curfew. He is injured and awake unbeknownst to him the woman had saved his life, the woman then continues to explain to Cleveland that she is in fact a water nymph and one of legend surrounded in mystery or so we think. Unfortunately what continues is this convoluted attempt at being a mysterious tale that continues to add more and more extra elements and characters attempting to add to the wonder yet only seems to confuse the viewer further and further. Don't expect a fulfilling climatic conclusion it only ending up honestly making me laugh hysterically in a few moments in the end there. Trying so hard to be the next 'Sixth Sense' effort it literally looks like it fell flat on it's face.",Lady in the Water
167,Jim-500,I wanted more,6,9 August 2006,"This is a very original movie, and it demands a lot of the audience. I knew early on that I was going to be asked to suspend disbelief big time, and I willingly went along with that expectation because Night's movies have a lot of soul to them. It's worth making the necessary sacrifices to enjoy his payoffs. But in the end I was disappointed. After 2/3 of the show was over I was ready to rewarded. Instead of a smooth transition from magic to a new reality promised by the build-up, suddenly things go awry and new characters are brought in, ones whom we don't necessarily care about. The trouble is, I felt that I really could care about these people but I couldn't because I didn't know enough about them--and I really wanted to. With a little better plotting I think this could have been a great movie. A prime example of how I felt let down was when the little boy is able to decipher major clues to the mystery from the sides of cereal boxes. But we're not shown how he does this. It made me think of the scene in Spielberg's ""E.T."" where the kids and alien are able to construct a way to phone home using junk found around the house--and we actually see how they do it. This scene would have been much more fascinating and believable if we had actually been shown what the boy was seeing on the boxes and why it was helping him derive the clues. Instead, we have to take his word for it--which is not much fun. The movie is worth it in that it does contain some nice dialogue about our place in the world and how to discover it. But in the end, I think Night should have taken some cues from his ill-fated movie critic character and paid more attention to his audience's wants, needs, and expectations.",Lady in the Water
168,zolaaar,Water Music,6,19 January 2010,"OK, I have to take up the cudgels for this film and for Shyamalan in general. I was never a fan or even close to, but I think Shyamalan is a man on a constant search and with a deep yearning for a better world. I really do. This film, taking it pure and simple is beautiful and gentle and whimsical just like one of these ALMOST perfect pop songs, where you can't help it, but love them. So, as with these songs I'm not going to respond with the nastiness of a cynic (or worse: of a critic ;) ) to Syamalan's Lady in the Water, but have to engage into the story which, as always in the director's oeuvre, combines everyday life with supernaturalness and shows an array of different characters who are all searching for the meaning in their own lives and/or already haver lost any courage and optimism. It's of course no psychologically elaborated masterpiece à la Bergman, and yet, it isn't bad either, as the majority thinks it is. Shot by Wong-long-time colleague and virtuoso Christopher Doyle, the film abstains from the usual, ""unbelievable"" twist at the end and rather tells a modern fairy tale (the idea to this movie arose when Shyamalan read his kids a bedtime story – this is a loose adaptation of that story) with charmed, broken characters, who finally find a purpose in life and at least change their present résumé through rescue at the end (this is no spoiler, of course we have a happy end here).

I was curious about it, and only after hiring it a second time and viewing with an open mind and no expectations, it has proved to be one of my new favourite films. It ranks there at number 1 with Signs as M Night's best work I think.Unlike a lot of people, I will watch and enjoy a film based on its ""atmosphere"" and ""feel"" even if the story/acting/directing is ATROCIOUS simply because the movie makes me feel good...so im not the best reviewer in that respect! Just a moment to talk about ""suspending disbelief"". People have absolutely SLAMMED this movie for being unbelievable and unrealistic...it's kinda supposed to be, you idiots. That's why it's described as a ""bed-time story""...i say to all people who trash movies for being ""unrealistic"" - go rent a documentary, you moron. Movies are supposed to be fantasies. You wanna talk about unrealistic, look at just about every Hollywood action movie that involves someone being SHOT. Being shot is VERY, VERY painful and debilitating (if it is not immediately fatal) and I have NEVER seen it portrayed realistically in a movie. You think car chases like you see in movies could really happen?

170,vinsond21,A vision of Night,5,31 July 2006,"Lady in the Water is M. Night Shyamalan's labor of conceit more than anything else. I shall not attempt to elaborate on this, as anybody who views this movie will know what i mean. Being supposedly a fable also kind of excuses the movie from having to make too much sense or be based on logic. At least the story is peopled by fairly interesting characters (the writer-director's forte seems to be colorful dialogue) with a strong lead performance by Paul Giamatti. On the other hand, as the narf or water nymph, Bryce Dallas Howard is pretty literally colorless although she effectively projects a delicate look. Besides the cast, the best thing about Lady in the Water is James Newton Howard's dreamy score which is, at the time of its release, the best of the year along with The Da Vinci Code's.",Lady in the Water
171,cwrdlylyn,LADY IN THE WATER : Shyamalan Challenges His Loudest Critics & Doesn't Win,6,27 July 2006,"LADY IN THE WATER LADY IN THE WATER takes place entirely in a Philadelphia apartment complex named The Cove. It is here that we meet Heep (played wonderfully as always by Paul Giamatti), the grounds-keeper who silently goes about taking care of the resident's tiny problems. Heep is a man with little to be passionate about, and he therefore devotes himself fully to a job he does not care about. He lives a mundane existence of distant relationships and closeted sadness, until one day a strange being appears in The Cove's swimming pool.One night, as Heep makes his rounds ensuring that no residents are swimming in The Cove's pool after hours, he is saved by a mysterious woman. Her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), and she is a Narf sent from the ""Blue World"" to find her other half in the world of man. As Story explains her reason for living in The Cove's pool, Heep slowly comes to realize that she is a character straight out of a bed-time story, and only with the help of his fellow residents can he bring this bed-time story to its ""Happily Ever After"" ending.While watching the film, the plot is every bit as far-fetched and ridiculous as it sounds. However, a ludicrous plot is not what makes LADY IN THE WATER such a polarizing film. As always, Shyamalan has managed to ground the film with a sense of realism, enabling his audience to suspend their disbelief and go along for the ride. Actually, I found LADY IN THE WATER's story to be its most engrossing element. What does end up hurting the film however are the indulgences Shyamalan allows himself far too freely.Had Shyamalan been satisfied to bring LADY IN THE WATER to the screen with a more peaceful and loving tone, perhaps it would have been better. Unfortunately, he has infused this uplifting story of normal humans finding their purpose with a bitter and defensive tone that only taints its message. It's funny that of all The Cove's eccentric residents, including a man who only works out half of his body and a child who sees messages in cereal boxes, the most deconstructive character to the film is a simple film critic, named Mr. Farber (Bob Balaban). In one scene, after thinking that Mr. Farber holds the key to unlocking the secret behind the Narf, we are told that his opinions never really mattered. The film clearly states that a film critic is nothing more than a man delusional enough to believe that his opinion is all that matters, and clearly no man with such blind arrogance could ever understand the true meaning of the Narf's story.Effectively, Shyamalan seems to be saying that any critic who doesn't like his film clearly lacks the ability to see the film's true meaning. It makes one wonder, if Shyamalan has such undying faith in his creative visions, why is he so confrontational and defensive throughout its presentation? It is this defensive and self-righteous attitude that slowly overtakes the film, dragging it down from what is an intriguing first half. The film continues to suffer as the film finds all too convenient ways to develop its plot. Solutions come all too easily and with little explanation. Perhaps had Shyamalan wisely omitted his obtrusive sub-plot involving Mr. Farber, the solutions could have been reached with more explanation and development.The things that Shyamalan has always excelled at continue to be his film's strongest asset. He casts his films very well, from the leading role played so richly by Paul Giamatti, to the ensemble cast of eccentrics that surround him. Though Bryce Dallas Howard relies too heavily on simply being ""other-worldly"" as opposed to developing a layered character, Shyamalan is able to frame her performance in such a way that it never detracts from the film. My only qualm in the casting is another example of the director's indulgence. Shyamalan has cast himself in a primary role for the first time in one of his films, and though he does a serviceable job, his presence is more of a distraction then anything. It also seems that perhaps the time he spent in front of the camera would have been better spent at home tightening the script or behind the camera giving the film a sweeter tone.Nonetheless, LADY IN THE WATER is a beautifully filmed movie with a distinct visual style and a powerful voice. Though not perfect, it certainly doesn't deserved to be called ""pretentious, paralyzing twaddle"" as Rex Reed so cruelly put it. In this era, it is a wonderful thing to have a director like M. Night Shyamalan even when his movies are not up to par. Whether good or bad, his movies always spark conversation. Even though LADY IN THE WATER will be viewed by many as an enormous disappointment, it is still a valiant (though misguided) attempt and it had this audience member talking all the way out of the theater. Let's just hope that after the dust settles over LADY IN THE WATER, Shyamalan listens to the advice of the film critics he seems to loathe so much and he loses a bit of his arrogance. Whether he does or not, I'll be in line to see what he comes up with next.... C- ...",Lady in the Water
172,aeo,"This is not as terrible as the ""Village"" but close to it.",1,29 July 2006,"Wow! Where do I start. This movie is not that bad as the Village but it certainly is no improvement from it.What also bothers me is that M. Night Shyamalan acts in this movie and he does not simply do a cameo appearance but rather portrays an important character in this movie. If M. Night Shyamalan is reading this, YOU CANNOT ACT!!! Leave the acting to people who know how.From what I understand, when M. Night Shyamalan sent the studio his script, they immediately recognized that this picture was going to suck like the Village and tried to persuade him to change certain things about it. He threatened to walk out on them if they did so they acquiesced to his demands and did not change anything and look what happened---they were right. This movie does suck.This movie should have been an indie movie and not a major motion picture. The whole feel of the movie as well as the story line fits just perfectly as an indie movie. At least if it was an indie movie, not many people would have had the chance to watch this terrible movie. The only thing I liked about this movie was Paul Giamatti. He gives a solid performance. Some of the supporting characters also gave good performances as well.The story is about some children story that no one knows about except one tenant in an apartment building where Paul Giamatti's character works as a manager. A woman mysteriously appears and seemed to be in trouble so Giamatti tries to help the woman and in time, discovers what she is and he tries to help her escape so that she can return to her world.The story just sucked. There simply is no other words to describe it. M. Night Shyamalan! If you are reading this, I want my money back. This is twice you burned me with your crappy movies!",Lady in the Water
173,irish23,"Shyamalan ""lite""",7,22 December 2006,"This was a lovely little film without the intense drama of Shyamalan's typical pieces (which I love!). Like all his films, it's slowly paced and quietly unfolded, with understatement the name of the game. A very welcome change from the bombast and over-production of most films. Knowing that this was a bedtime story gave it a feeling of intimacy right from the start. We follow along with the adventure, not knowing what's coming next, but understanding there will be a strong moral and an ending that will allow us to fall safely asleep.From this standpoint, it was highly satisfactory. However, it's probably not a film I'll see again. I've seen most of Shyamalan's films multiple times because of their many layers of meaning. This one was a little pat -- good for a bedtime story but not so much for a film. I'm glad I saw it and, as always, thought the acting was outstanding. The camera-work didn't seem up to Shyamalan's usual standards but I didn't care so much. I also wish he wouldn't act in his own films. I can't ever see the character; I can only see him. It always takes me out of the story. But overall, this a great cast, a nice story, and a lovely message.",Lady in the Water
174,GethinVanH,Self-indulgent fantasy pap,3,9 July 2008,"I wanted to see if this really was horrible as everyone says and yes it is. The story delves into magic and myth and becomes so convoluted that I stopped caring because it had all become so tedious. Add to the fact that there is a Mary Sue character which is actually played by Shyamalan himself who's some kind of divine writer who will change humanity for the better. It's just a *tad* self-indulgent. Paul Giamatti is a great actor but he's out of place in this puff piece. Of course the movie is also a ""screw you"" to film critics who hated some of Shyamalan's other movies like the awful ""The Village"". Instead of being so reactionary he should try writing a decent movie. The critics were right. This is putrid.The problem with fantasy stories like this is that they have no cohesive plot and they're all over the place. I'm sure Shyamalan's fantasy world makes sense to him but the rest of us are left boggling over his excessive details. There are so many elements of this story that aren't necessary that it's obvious that M. Night is one of those writers who is editor proof. He gets what he wants because he's had hits in the past.

The experience of viewing it on the large screen was certainly highly worthwhile since it at times grabs and pushes you to moments of fear, sadness, and elation. Maybe it is a bit gimmicky and new age-ish for some people's passing judgment on it but I found it enthralling. The performances are top-notch as we see some physical transformation and special effects, much better than those in the director's SIGNS (2002), that keep us guessing whether our sense of movie conventions can be trusted or not. If I could tone down some aspects of it, I guess the music was a bit heavy to affect first-time viewers; the motley group that comprise the apartment complex population was quite a bit more harmonious than much of America 2006 (Year 5 of the ""war on terror"") is usually depicted in the mass media and in my circle of experience.

177,Thunderbuck,Still wondering what to make of this...,7,26 July 2006,"LADY IN THE WATER is, frankly, a mess. The acting is uneven, the editing is peculiar, the dialogue is stilted and completely unconvincing, and there are so many distracting elements that I found it impossible to suspend my disbelief and forget I was watching a movie.What I'm having trouble figuring out, though, is whether or not this was what Mr. Shayamalan intended. So much of this is so breathtakingly bad, in so many ways. The apartments of the various tenants not only don't resemble each other, they don't look like they belong in the building in which the film is set. Rather than his usual cameo (brilliantly staged in THE VILLAGE), Shyamalan casts himself in a fairly significant role here; he MUST have known how distracting that would be. Paul Giamatti's character of Cleveland Heep is the apartment complex's caretaker, but rather than occupy an apartment in the building, he lives in a rather charming little cottage that appears much older than the rest of the complex; surely a telling detail. And Heep owns both an old manual typewriter AND a personal computer; interesting but ultimately not probative when it comes to the story. Little clues like naming the title character ""Story"" and including a character who's a film critic suggest that there's more to this movie than what we see on the surface.I think this movie is something of a game, one that would have been better done as, say, a one hour HBO special.

179,ejonconrad,"AKA ""The Attack of M. Night Shyamalan's Ego""",2,13 December 2018,"I watched this before and I remembered it was pretty bad, but I'd forgotten exactly how bad until I re-watched it yesterday.This movie is correctly remembered as the point when things started to go South for wunderkind M. Night Shyamalan. He had the incredible success of Sixth Sense and Signs, and while the Village was flawed, it still had a quirky charm and more importantly it made a ton of money, so Hollywood was still willing to throw suitcases of money at his next concept, which turned out to be this - apparently without reading the script.Clearly, at this point, he was drunk with his own success and reputation, and believed that anything that came from his keyboard would be a movie for the ages. If fact, this whole script seemed like it was written by a middle schooler whose Montessori teacher had been ""nurturing his creativity"" by giving him praise he didn't deserve.Anyway, the film opens with a weird little folktale about ""water people"" and ""land people"" (terms that will never again be used in the movie), and then we cut to an apartment complex, set in the deep woods of .... Philadelphia? Unlike real apartment complexes in real cities, this one has a ""groundskeeper's house"", where our protagonist Paul Giamatti lives. We learn later that he's had a profound tragedy in his past, but that doesn't really explain the ""registered sex offender"" persona Shyamalan apparently told him to adopt for the movie. It appears someone has been swimming in the pool after 7PM (what sort of buzzkill apartment complex is this?) and this fact is making Giamatti apoplectic with rage. One night he spots someone jumping into the pool and jumps in after her, at which point he appears to almost drown (even though later in the movie, he establishes that he's not only an excellent swimmer, but can also hold his breath for like 15 minutes). He can't find her, but when he gets out of the pool he's so flustered that he slips and knocks himself unconscious.When he wakes up, he find the eponymous ""Lady in the Water"" is sitting on his couch in one of his shirts (we establish later that she's perfectly comfortable walking around naked, but, you know, PG rating). She tells him she's a ""Narf"" from the ""Blue World"" (what happened to ""water person""?). He repays her for her kindness in bringing him inside, by letting her fall asleep and then trying to take her outside and dump her half naked on a chaise lounge at the pool - you know, like you do. He discovers there are these weird grass covered dog monster things that she tells him are called ""scrunts"" (really, M. Night?). This is when things get really inconsistent about how much she knows and how much she's willing to tell him. Sometimes, she speaks (and reads!) perfect English and is rather effusive, while other times, she seems barely able to talk.At this point, rather than try to learn about her world from her, he decides he needs to find an ethnic stereotype to clear things up, so he goes to Young-Soon Choi, who's played by a Chinese American actress who was apparently told to perfect her Chinese accent by watching South Park episodes. For no particular reason, he asks her if she's ever heard of a ""Narf"", but as (incredible, unimaginable) luck would have it, she remembers the term (which apparently is the same in Chinese) from a folktale her grandmother told her. They go to the grandmother and - will the luck never stop? - not only does she remember the folktale, she has an *encyclopaedic knowledge* of ""Narf"", ""scrunts"", ""giant eagles"", ""guadiands"", ""the guild"", ""tartutics"", and a bunch of other stuff, so for the rest of the movie, she effectively dictates the plot, which doesn't have enough of a message or make enough sense even to spoil.In addition to the silly plot, the writing is terrible. The dialog sounds like it was written by someone who didn't speak English and was using Google translate. At times, Shyamalan tries to go for humor, but it's cringeworth, and at other times, it's unintentionally hilarious, just be being so terrible.Oh yeah, this movie cost $70M(!), some of which went to building the whole apartment complex from scratch so Shyamalan wouldn't have to drive too far. In spite of the big budget, the special effects are remarkably cheap looking.Good candidate for ""bad movie night"", but really nothing else.",Lady in the Water
180,cafesmitty,Interesting... of sorts...,7,22 July 2006,"There is a reason I gave this film a 7 out of 10. It is a very well-crafted film, but that doesn't make it a great film, just a good film, but not good enough to shell out the type of money they charge at movie theaters. First, let me say that this is not a obvious, hit you on the head type of movie. And it has a quiet way about it, but the problem with this film is that it feels like there is something missing. You are watching it and you want the film to take off a bit more than it does. M. Night likes subtleness. What I mean is he likes the hint of things that ""could"" be possible. He uses the hint of the supernatural in The Sixth Sense. In Unbreakable, its the hint of possible you could be more just your mundane self. With Signs the obvious hint is aliens. And in the Village, you get a hint of perception and things people do to drastically change their lives. With all those previous movies, there is always a possibility of being true and things that has been discuss amongst people for years (is it true, or isn't it, no definitive answer).In this film, however, the subject matter isn't believable. He doesn't sell it very well. The audience really have to take a giant leap, but that leap doesn't make sense. Don't get me wrong, it was still interesting and the performance by Paul Giamata is outstanding. I think him being exposed in a more accessible film like this (instead of the indie flicks), and having to carry the picture, will get him noticed by mainstream audience. He is, after all, has to carry the whole picture. It has some good humor in it, but overall, its doesn't make sense. So in summation, if you take this film, as a fairy tale, then yeah, it's cool. But it's not very exciting. It's like Signs meets The Village. Still, its a lot better than the other stuff thats out. This is a rental and is probably best watching the film at home. So proceed with caution.",Lady in the Water

Unbreakable Sixth Sense Signs The Village ( I liked it, but I hated the promotions for it)and now Lady in the Water.I must say this is by far the worst of all his movies. I love the world that he takes you into with this made up fairytale and unlikely narrator in an Asian college student. But the movie is lacking. Like all of M. Night's movie their is a huge plot twist in which this one is no different. But this plot twist was so easy to figure out, well for me and my movie companion anyway.The ending of this movie is just horrible. He didn't tie up all of the loose ends that the movie created. It would be better as a set up for a sequel, but he never does sequels. It would have been a great movie to just tell the story about where the lady in the water was from and then go into the movie we saw or let's go to her world at the end of the movie.I get this movie is designed to make you think about what kind of world we live in. But at the same time he insults his fans, critics, and movie producers all in one movie. I think M. Night is making a serious career mistake. He had a name big enough to draw you into movies off of his name alone, one more horrible movie can anyone say ""Woody Allen"".He should probably try a piece not written by him. Just a thought.YOU KNOW The original Disney's producers of this movie said that he was missing something in this script and they suggested he change some of it. Instead of re-writing it he got so upset with the Disney production team for not understanding the work he shopped it around and it ended up at Warner Bros who produced it without change, simply because of his name. Should've listened to Disney and he would've made a movie that made more sense and he would've made more at the box office.He was going for gold and barely got glitter!",Lady in the Water

Because of the film's humane values, its hopeful and comforting idea of a meaningful universe where mystery adjoins the mundane, of sympathetic allies more than willing to help out, the possibility of awakening and rebirth - and they enjoyed its eccentricity! For me this just wasn't enough; I wanted a nice crisp plot, logical consistency, a story that flowed smoothly, and a fantasy believably based on a real fairy tale! The ""fairy tale"" of the film is really a spiritual allegory - flawed humanity, having lost its way, must be reminded of its true nature/purpose/values by magical messengers who come to awaken a single soul. Shyamalan throws in some oddball elements to add the message that identifying our true nature is critical but not easy, that humanity is connected not isolated, and the film's main concern, that 'getting the plot' isn't the same as getting the message and solving the problems. There's a lot of good stuff in this story about Story, but it's not told in a way that can work for the multiplex audience, and that's a shame.The wounded healer is saved by a muse: fine. The muse's name is Story: survivable. She's a Narf and a Scrunt's after her until the Great Green Eagle takes her back to the Blue World: unnecessary and irritating. The truth is in a fairy tale told by a traditionalist Mom: fine. You have to be a child again to 'get' the story: yeah yeah. The clichés of the critics don't hold the answers: good for a giggle. Everyone's got a role to play but not what you'd expect: what you'd expect. The wounded healer saves himself by saving someone else, he reconnects with himself by connecting with others: oldie-but-goodie. A certain somebody is the avatar who's works will inspire the world: unnecessary and embarrassing.The BIG problem here is that the fantastic elements of the film just don't awaken wonder and aren't really necessary to the story; they're just tossed in to make some action happen. And then there's the pacing: alternately jumpy and grinding as the fairy tale gets doled out in drips and drabs to advance the story. The suspense and shocks shouldn't be provided by the scrunt, Mr. S!!! The characters... I'd say OK; none are truly stereotypes, though they don't get enough space to be archetypes. We don't really need anyone but Cleveland (Giametti) to show development but it would be nice if ""the Writer"" did...Manoj, you need a reality check. It's time to take a well-earned break from these one-man-shows. Collaborate!!! Find a nice book, get a good screenwriter, and direct! What's Julia Cameron working on these days?It's not fair to dismiss this as sentimental pap, but despite its worthy themes it's not a particularly good piece of film-making either. And that's going to hurt Shyamalan's ability to tell world-inspiring stories.",Lady in the Water
184,bondgirl6781,A Fairy Tale for the Current Times,7,21 July 2006,"I am a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan and I love the actors casted in his films including this one. Two years ago I saw ""The Village"" and I was not very impressed by the film because midway into it I already knew what was going to happen. Shyamalan has a way of telling a story with special meaning surrounded by symbolism and a strange atmosphere. His characters are ordinary people sometimes quirky and strange, but nonetheless ordinary. His characters are not the glamorous people we are accustomed and pay the average ticket to watch. ""Lady in the Water"" tells the story of Cleveland Heaps (the always wonderful and great character actor Paul Giamatti) a superintendent of an apartment complex called The Cove. One night as he makes his usual inspections he encounters and is rescued by a strange and mysterious young woman named Story (the lovely Bryce Dallas Howard). Story is a sea nymph who lives in what is called the Blue World (under water) and she is a creature with a unique message to give to the world of the humans. A message that will save the world and its future. Cleveland realizes that Story is very special and very fragile. Her mission is to deliver this special message and then ascend to a world that will ensure humanity's future and the prophecy to be fulfilled. She is in danger from an evil wolf-like creature bent on keeping Story in the Earth world. Cleveland must protect her and help her to accomplish her mission and at same time heal a wound from a traumatic past. We are introduced to characters in the apartment complex who all have unique gifts and will play a role in Story's mission. M. Night Shyamalan is without question a writer and director that loves to keep you guessing and this film will keep you guessing. His characters are quirky and strange, but you begin to see that their quirkiness and strange characteristics are special and start to embrace them. Shyamalan is known for casting actors that are not big names and prefers to cast people with talent and not based entirely on star caliber. ""Lady in the Water"" is indeed a story, a fairy tale with an sweet or unique message that resonates at the end of the film. The film was wonderfully directed, sweetly written, and excellently acted by the ensemble cast.",Lady in the Water
185,movedout,beautiful picture that puts you right in the atmosphere of the apartment complex,8,3 April 2007,"I think the critics had a problem with it from a film theory point of view because it didn't build on the characters, often leaving them stereotypes to work with and unexplained backstories. You can't say that any of the characters have relevant depth. At least thats what I get when they say Shyamalan has no narrative cohesion which was arguably Sixth Sense's most notable point.But from a perspective of a film-going experience, I can see see why I like it and why its advocates might have liked it as well. It is a bedtime story come to life which is why the overwrought scenes work. It's like something you might have daydreamed about after reading a fairy tale anthology. It's so visceral and in the moment for the greater part of the film, when you're on your toes to find out what he's going to pull out of his hat next. Maybe a witch? Perhaps a character reversal that was not hinted at? It does seem like a story he made on the fly which somehow made sense in the context of the tale.It's also a beautiful picture that puts you right in the atmosphere of the apartment complex that it hardly departs from, imaginative angles and the intriguing dialogue is something I've come to expect from his films. He's also tried out humour this time round with the critical inclusion of Paul Giamatti which I felt was its biggest asset. He manages to switch between drama and comedy with such ease that his character is rightly the centre of the entire film.I also don't see the big hullabaloo about Shyamalan casting himself as the future's intellectual saviour, he could have easily casted somebody else but its not like his acting ruined the film. He wasn't Sofia Coppola bad by any stretch of the imagination. It's a personal project for him, especially with the critic character's inclusion. It's an audible F You to those that can his films after Sixth Sense like they were the biggest creative flops ever made. If they failed to see some humour in that then they do deserve to get flipped off. Director's have egos, some have vast vanity projects, and people need to understand why thats interesting not insulting.I really do feel like watching the movie again, I would think it'd be better the second time around. Like being told a bedtime story again and again or playing through an RPG again just because the glut of characters and mythos were so exciting the first time round.",Lady in the Water
186,markymark70,Utter Rubbish,1,23 June 2009,"I loved Shyamalan's Sixth Sense and also thoroughly enjoyed 'The Village' (even though that was panned). But I did not not like Unbreakable or Signs. Shyamalan is like Marmite - you either love his film or you hate it. He polarises opinion even amongst his own fans - of which I was one. I haven't yet seen'The Happening' so I cannot comment, however, I just managed to sit through Lady in the Water. Just.But where do I even start with this one? If I have to sum it up in one word, it would be 'mess'.A bedtime story for his kids - the plot (if you can call it that) is preposterous, the characters unbelievable, the premise incredulous and the dialogue atrocious. The direction leaves a lot to be desired and what was the whole point of the movie? There was none. The basic rundown of the story is this: Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), a maintenance man at an apartment complex, finds a very strange, scared girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the pool one night, and soon he finds out a) her name is 'Story' - what kind of name is that? b) she's called a 'narf' - based on an old tale piecemealed to him by a Chinese tenant c) she needs to leave this place before some weird moss-covered dog creatures called 'scrunts' come after her d) practically all of the tenants at the apartment complex will somehow play a role in her getting safely away on the talons of an giant eagle. I kid you not. That is truly it. The Narf somehow inspires a guy who is suffering from 'writer's block' to finish his book which will someday inspire a future president of America. This guy is the reason she comes from her own mythical world - and who is this guy? You guessed it - Shyamalan himself in a strange, ego-massaging role as the chosen one. A latter day John the Baptist if you like.My brain hurts on so many levels writing this review as the film is just complete codswallop. Some examples of my frustration are: 1. When the sea-nymph arrives from the water and spouts her preposterous story - Giamatti immediately believes her and lets her stay in his apartment - semi-naked. Not only that but when Giamatti retells the story to all others - they ALL believe it without question. What? 2. Giamatti then sees the underground home of the nymph beneath the swimming pool - but continues on as if this is a normal everyday occurrence. What? No T.V., no questions? 3. Howard stays in the apartment - naked by the way - and simply stares off into space for 90% of her scenes. She whispers incoherently for the other 10%. 4. Characters appear on screen explaining the story to us - telling us the story instead of allowing the audience to figure it out for themselves. Basic, fundamental flaw of film-making if you ask me. Or maybe it was because the story is ridiculous - and no-one could ever figure it out or be bothered to figure it out. 5. A kid is able to read obscure, prophetic messages from a collection of cereal boxes. I'm serious. 6. The kids father does nothing only crossword puzzles each day. 7. One guy exercises only his right arm. 8. Giamatti must have had blisters on his knuckles after this shoot as he is involved in numerous 'knocking on doors' scenes. After a while - it just turned into a joke. 9. Shyamalan's scene changing and framing were strange to say the least. Downright poor to be truthful about it. 10. The finale - was that it? That's what we sat through 100 minutes for? To say I was disappointed is to say the Pope is Catholic. What a letdown !!Nothing makes sense about this film - the whole thing is testament to the fact that Disney turned it down. Good call. Shyamalan has made something here that if it wasn't for his previous successes - would be a career-breaker. Utter tosh. Avoid at all costs.1/10 - only because I cannot bring myself to give a 0/10 rating for a movie.",Lady in the Water
187,HiddenVoice,"This Lady should stay in the water,in order to save Shyamalan.....",4,18 July 2006,"Wide Awake ,Sixth Sense ,Unbreakbale ,Signs ,Village, all these movies were superior than the each other in terms of film-making,but they all somehow suffered from overdone clichés and same repetitive style of plotting and with abrupt twists.And they were all good but somehow the twists never relate to the film.Although if you analyze them separately , you'll find something to think about ,a la Village.The twists never complete the films ,they always shatters the film's buildup but if you look at the twist only, there's something to think about.Although here, for the first time,he may not have implied any of his Twist Endings, the climax, however,was so ridiculous and absurd that you kind of wished that he should've brought up a Twist to save himself from total embarrassment.At the edge of tolerance ,I think he should stop making films for a while before he dwells into complete downfall.He has made a good career for himself,but now he should take a break or try something new.I mean even Hitchkock tried different types of films to show his versatility as a filmmaker.Night's trademark is getting too clichéd and unbearable.The thing is that,you can lose interest in his films very easily.If he is able to engage you and suck you with his films from the very beginning then it's likely you don't wanna miss the whole film.But if you somehow lose interest or are put off by his film's pacing or halfway through then you are likely not to sit through the whole thing,not to mention you would want to miss the ending. Here it's the same case,for the first half an hour or so,he keeps you tied to your seat,but then problem begins when the narf thing goes a little too silly and all.And the film enters it's own world of dumbness.The stupid and childish story goes as A Narf(Bryce Dallas Howard) from another world is discovered by a Building Manager(Cleaveland,played by Paul Giamatti),whom he must help to return her to her world.So,him and his neighbors join forces to help save this creature and send her back to her home world safely.But some deadly creatures are after her and the tenants must work together to save this Narf ,and they are all in some kind of Bedtime story,in which they are one of the many characters.And....oh yes,the narf is actually called ""Story"".Wow,ain't that fascinating.This is pure fantasy ,and it only applies to kids as a bedtime story.Not a feature length film.Ofall the films,Unbreakable has been his best effort in a mon avis.It is a very complex and ingeniously crafted film that never lets the audience go.I loved the pacing and surprises and the uniqueness of that film.It showed that this guy is not another director.Sixth Sense was a little too overrated for me.And Signs,was brilliantly crafted.Once again showing that this guy is not your average director.He made something out of nothing.A simple story made powerful by his screenplay.Although,I think the twist in the end is his weakest.Then comes Village,which was once again an intriguing piece,but there was great amount of weakness in his film-making that I spotted.He underused his actors ,he was testing the audiences patience and it got kind of silly as it approaches its ending.But I liked the twist ending.It was a provoking third act.But it should be separated from the entire film and looked at differently.And after that ,he was just dragging around until the end with predictable surprises.The Lady in the Water shows flaws,errors,and his weakness early on.You can clearly spot that he has lost his touch and imagination.There was no originality.I mean was he making this film for kids or for adults or for both or for simply to satisfy his curiosity?It appeals to no one.I liked his films,but I pretty much despise this one.The story is too conventional,plotting too clichéd,the film feels too familiar/predictable.The concept is absurd and unintentionally funny.And even the actors are just tossed around.This man without twist endings ,is a bird without wings.His climax is even worse than his twists.This Lady should stay in the water,in order to save Shyamalan.The main reason I went to watch this film was not Shyamalan,which I already expected this film to be his worst.It was Giamatti that I wanted to see.First time watching him in a Shyamalan film.Where Night,always makes his actors look dull and then pull a few surprises.Here,Giamatti finds his worst role yet.He is totally dull and pale.It's as if he's been sick throughout the production.He has none of that charm he showed in his earlier films.It is a major disappointment.And Howard,who was impressive in Shyamalan's first film,is surprisingly mute.She is absolutely stone faced.She barley had anything to do.And I never thought Shyamalan could go this wrong to waste talents like those.Even Jeffery Wright is totally messed up.I guess Night was too busy promoting himself and trying his acting chops.I have to say,he can definitely act.And that is more than just a cameo.He should think thrice before he pulls another of those tricks.The CGI creatures are his best yet.Unlike Village,in which we barely see the ""monsters"".Shyamalan gives more exposure to the creatures and they look impressive.Unlike in the Village,where when the creatures were revealed they quickly made you laugh.The effects were well used.And of course the film would be hopeless if it didn't had a good score.And the cinematography ,as usual,is fantastic.Gives the film a richer look.Shallow, bland, overlong, dull, unoriginal, conventional, overstuffed, convoluted,absurdly paced,painfully slow,and the worst film of the year.This is not to be expected from a Shyamalan film.I think he should consider a vacation.If he continues making films after films,his career can pretty much vanish faster than he can say ""Unbreakable"".Probably,I'll consider him lucky if this film survives at the box office,with it's unnecessary big budget.I don't know where all the money went. Still,there is something to watch here.For one thing is watching Shyamalan act.I'm sorry folks,but I think you should stay away from this Shyamalan-obsessed-with-water film.",Lady in the Water
188,mobadizhere,A relaxing and original film!,8,10 September 2018,"I adore Shyamalan's originality in his films. This movie was one of his more interesting flicks because of where it comes from. It was originally a bedtime story that Shyamalan would tell his kids at night, and when they tell the story throughout the movie, you feel invested and interested in how the end result will turn out. It provokes thought, which is a plus in a movie like this, and I adore Shyamalan's originality. Really great film for anytime!",Lady in the Water
189,alecwest,Be open-minded and leave your yardsticks at home.,10,21 July 2006,"I just returned from seeing the film at its first showing at my local theater. Prior to seeing the film, I read a number of critical appraisals. Some were positive, some not. One critic rated it shamelessly in the middle, saying it was a painfully bad script - but one that worked. In short, many critics are seeing the film with different eyes than their colleagues. Two review excerpts: First, a positive one from Desson Thomson of the Washington Post: ""Until now, Shyamalan's work has been one of masterful trickery, designed to keep audiences spellbound until the end credits. But for the first time, the filmmaker illuminates a world beyond scheme, beyond the shell games of his earlier films. In ""Lady in the Water,"" we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves. The eventual outcome of their lives is something we contemplate long after the movie has ended. That's the mark of an artist who makes it his business to push the boundaries of storytelling in Hollywood. And that's exciting."" Second, a negative one from Rick Warner of Bloomberg News: ""M. Night Shyamalan made a movie about ominous signs, so he probably should have detected one when Walt Disney Co. executives told him they couldn't understand his script for Lady in the Water. Instead, he pitched the story to Warner Bros., which agreed to make the film about a grief-stricken apartment manager who discovers a nymph-like woman in the community swimming pool. The result is one of the most preposterous and pretentious movies I've ever seen, a waterlogged disaster from its solemn start to its hokey finish."" Me? I've seen hundreds and hundreds of films (I managed theaters for 12 years). And based on what I saw at my theater today, I would have to agree with Mr. Thomson of the Washington Post. At the same time, I can understand why Warner and other critics quickly pounced on Shyamalan. To many critics, his first film, The Sixth Sense, is used as a yardstick against which his subsequent films are measured. And, having seen his earlier films, I must say this is a departure for Shyamalan. But, as Thomson said, ""...we no longer think of his characters as mere slaves of the narrative but mazes unto themselves."" Thomson was merely open-minded enough to watch the movie with different eyes than he watched Shyamalan's previous films ... a talent many film critics lack. When released on DVD, I will buy it to watch again and again.",Lady in the Water
190,rbsjrx,Shyamalan for people who don't like Shyamalan,8,1 August 2006,"I'm not a fan of Shyamalan's films. His predictable twists have made him the most self-important auteur of his generation. Unfortunately, I'm the only one in my family who has this opinion. As a result, I wound up going to see LITW with my granddaughter. I was quite surprised at how good it was. While this will never make it into my top 10 films list, it's a well-crafted fantasy film.Perhaps that's why it worked so well for me. Shyamalan wasn't trying to be clever. This was just good old fashioned storytelling and he did it well. Others here have commented that this is a fantasy, a bedtime story, and they're quite right. It appears that when Shyamalan isn't trying to scare us, creep us out, or impress us with how clever he is, his true talent as a storyteller comes out. It's like he sees himself as Rod Serling doing The Twilight Zone when he's really Jim Henson doing Labyrinth. As a footnote, I'd add that his performance in a featured role was extremely well-done as well.As with his previous films, I'll break down and buy the DVD when it comes out for my wife and family to watch. Unlike his previous films, I'll actually watch this one again.Postscript:It's now been some time since I originally wrote this and I did buy the DVD. Despite this film's inclusion in several ""Worst films of the year"" lists, my opinion remains the same. Perhaps those who bash it so unmercifully have lost the capacity to view it with the childlike innocence the material demands. I still recommend it to those less jaded.",Lady in the Water

The floor was awash in popcorn oil and the seat in front was tilted so far back the guy in front was hitting my knees with his head in my lap. Some braincell challenged guy also thought he had to add his own comments every half hour or so to enhance our viewing pleasure. Despite all of this I think this was the best M. Night Shamaylan movie so far. He manages to mix a hodgepodge of personalities from a low-rent apartment building into a mythological task force through caretaker Cleveland Heep, Paul Giammati's character. There is so much off-beat humor and characterization here that you do not even think when all of these people cooperate with each other for some completely ridiculous goal(I live in NYC, this would never really happen). Nevertheless, this is what Shamaylan achieves. This is not Lord of the Rings and the script constantly swings between the mundane and the fantastic, but in the end manages to balance these two worlds - just as the Blue World and the World of Men are being balanced. Once again I think the critics miss the sheer fun of the willing suspension of disbelief that this movie elicits from it's viewers.

I don't know what the problem is here... he seems to think he's making masterpieces and we should be ""reading"" into these EPICS, in fact, each one of his films has got gradually worse.Please please, do not make me waste my life on another M Night Shyamalan film... they're stuck up self important drivel and how this film is averaging 6.2 is beyond belief.It's the worst film he's done ever... in previous outings, at least there's signs of brilliance in there amongst the dross... here...

193,Quentintarantado,"I'm on the side of favorable, just barely",7,24 July 2006,"I like the movie. Clearly I'm curious about what will happen next and Shyamalan is if anything, a storyteller. I like the world he's created, both in the Blue World and in the Cove. I like Giamatti's growth from apartment manager resigned from life to hero. I manage to succeed (for the most part) in Shyamalan's distracting role as the McGuffin (he literally is, here). I like the whole idea of the Cove as a world. It's the Blue World that seems not to fit, like an intrusion here. If stakes were as high as they were, why would one Serunt stalk the maiden Narf? Wouldn't it be appropriate to send an army? Also the ending seems to have been taken over by creatures. The eagle, the Serunt, the Tartutics. It seemed the small quiet characters were pushed aside for the special effects ending. Maybe my comments seem a bit petty especially since this is supposed to be a fairy tale and we should suspend belief, but I think LESS explanation would have helped. I never bothered about these questions regarding another film, yes it's a different genre but it also had creatures and it didn't give a fig about origins, ""The Descent"". Women in caves with monsters. Who are they? Why are they there? Who gives a fig? Also, I know they spent a lot on the creatures of the story, well done, realistically rendered especially in the rain sequences, but I'd rather they be kept more in the dark. That would make them truly scary. It's not a bad film. It didn't polarize me to love it without reservation nor to hate it with a passion. However, I honestly can't give it a rating above what I've given, a seven.",Lady in the Water
194,editor-299,Shyamalan's water tale take a while to surface,6,18 July 2006,"In a long-winded prologue to Warner Bros.' newest release, Lady in the Water, we are told that long ago, water creatures and earth-dwellers (Man) used to live side by side, but, as Man moved further inland and began killing and stuff, the two groups became separated. This film attempts to show what happens when the two worlds meet again at last.Known for his twists and turns of the plot key, writer/director/actor M. Night Shyamalan (""Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" ""Signs"") goes from the fantasy monsters of an entrenched cult (""The Village"") to the very real evil creatures of a bedtime story that invade a suburban Philadelphia apartment house.Soft-spoken, brow-beaten manager, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti, ""Sideways,"" ""Cinderella"" Man,"" ""American Splendor""), goes through the motions of his dreary job each day, fixing drains, killing bugs, cleaning up messes and showing new tenants to their rooms.Nothing exciting ever happens in this mundane world except for his encounters with a motley group of dwellers; a black man that solves crossword puzzles (Jeffrey Wright, ""Broken Flowers""), an Asian mom and daughter, and Indian writer (Shyamalan) and his sister, a lonely man who never speaks, a Mexican with five daughters, a group of idiotic potheads, a moron that only exercises one side of his body, a milquetoast movie critic, and, of course, the weird cat-loving old lady (Mary Beth Hurt).One day, however, Heep sees someone in the apartment pool and  thinking the person is drowning  jumps in to rescue them. As it turns out, the exotic, pale, red-haired, blue-eyed lady, Story (Bryce Dallas Howard - Ron's daughter - ""The Village""), is a sea nymph (or a ""narf"") who is sent to Philadelphia to find people to help her get back home. I guess this is the reason, as it's never really made clear WHY she chose to arrive where she is when she did.Evidently, the people in the complex will be her healer, guardian, interpreter and guild as she awaits a huge eagle to take her back to the Blue World, from whence she came, to rule as queen. But, there are dangers ahead, as wolves who looks like clumps of grass plan to kill her for some reason.Trying to piece together the nymph's tale of woe (she cannot articulate it to him), he has to rely on the young Asian woman (a hilarious performance by Cindy Cheung, ""Spiderman 2""), who interprets the story as told by her mother.Not as silly as it all sounds, and there are some interesting moments and a few real frights in the enterprise. Some slow moments, especially in the beginning due to Shyamalan's deliberate attempt to develop character. And, in ensemble pictures like this, the danger of so many parts clouding the waters (pun intended) always looms.Some may also accuse the director/writer of once again wallowing in his own ego and gorging on his own past successes, but overall, the movie is not as terrible as many would lead one to believe. Given half a chance, this will probably be a surprise sleeper in the summer film lexicon.",Lady in the Water
195,dean2900,Why the horrible marketing????,4,2 December 2006,"First off, let me say this type of movie is not my cup of tea but I expected something much more along the lines of the supernatural/horror and fantasy genre.This movie is a clumsy attempt at a PG-13 fairy tale.It is not scary, does have some supernatural and fantasy elements but does not have any horror or scares.Consider it a bedtime story for adults.The acting is mediocre, the story is downright dumb IMO, and there is no clever twists are turns.M. Night made a brilliant movie in the Sixth Sense and while I caught on a little while before the audience, he pulled off a miracle by catching 90% of the population by surprise. Also, this was a well made movie and does have some replay value especially for a 2nd viewing when you see the hints are all there that Bruce Willis never interacted with any of the other characters.Signs was a better than average sci/fi movie and I am one of the few who truly enjoyed unbreakable.However, with Lady in the Water and the Village, I think M. Night needs to take some time off and work on creativity and story telling.The movies keep getting a little worse with each new release.",Lady in the Water
196,eched,Thank God he tried something new!,8,21 December 2006,"After the unsurprising, for me at least, let down that was The Village I said to myself, if M. Night Shyamalan pulls this stuff one more time I'm going to give up on him all together and never again see one of his films. It's not that Village was bad, in fact it was fantastic and some could argue his best film, but I had already seen it three times before. His first four films, Signs, Six Sense and Unbreakable are so similar they could be called the same film. Same tone, same visuals, same style of characters and dialog, and many of the same plot points(red means something bad, a falling apart family on the rocks(Unbreakable, Sense and Signs all had this plot point)), and as we all know each and every film of his ended the exact same way with a massive plot twist.In other words, it felt like Night wasn't making films. It felt like he was just remaking the first one over and over again. I had seen it all before and no matter how much better he got at telling the story he was going to make me sick of the thing by re-feeding me the same old, same old.Of course without a doubt many agree with me since The Village did so poorly and thankfully at last Night realized that if he wanted to stay in the games of making films he would have to reinvent himself.In walks Lady In the Water, one of the best director revamps since Wes Craven broke out of old school horror and went into dark satire with Scream.Night tried to change everything from the tone to look, to the characters. For the characters, which in all his other films were quite good and interesting, but seemed to repeat a few times(the child from Unbreakable and Sense is almost the exact same kid, minus being able to see the dead) he gives them each an odd ball character trait and then focuses in on that to make the character stand out. The main character, Cleveland, stutters constantly. Another character can't stop getting into arguments with her mom. One more has one side of his body that is twice the size as the other. By making these unique character traits Night is able to make the characters original and make them stand out far more. It is a rather creative way of making a character, and for the film it works very well.The second thing he does is throw in some comedy, which was never before done in one of his films. By adding a sense of humor it is insured that this film will be different from his others in that aspect at least and his trade mark style of dialog works wonders with a sarcastic, sly, quirky sense of humor. As a result the film is surprisingly funny at times. The opening itself is extremely silly and pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the film, though of course the whole film isn't funny and is at heart a thriller/drama.The third thing he does is get rid of the twist ending, thank God, but in a very odd ball way. There is now a twist everywhere except for the ending. Very funny Night, very funny. Every ten minutes a new plot point will pop up and turn the whole film around. This causes the films one real problem. The plot is added to every couple of minutes and as a result feels sporadic and a bit all over the place. Luckily this is the only bad point and this no doubt will bug me a lot less on second viewing.Another up side is the tone. This film feels oddly more family oriented then the others. That's not a surprise though since he made it for his kids.So, this film is simply Night trying something new. Some may love it, some may hate it, but its a big step up from where he was.Personally it won me over with its originality. Good going Night. You've got me being a fan of yours again.Hopefully you don't recycle this film four times in a row. Peace.",Lady in the Water
197,sullibrandon,Another worthy Shyamalan Film,7,22 August 2006,"Lady in the Water had me slightly apprehensive. After a less than stellar performance with The Village, though admittedly still very impressive by any scary movie standards, M. Night Shyamalan seemed to be losing his touch. I had always wondered how many twist endings the guy could keep coming up with and still make it by as a credible filmmaker. The guy clearly has an immense amount of talent, but I believe me may be stretching himself too thin by continuously sticking to the same kind of genres over and over again, even if he is good at it. Thankfully, Lady in the Water is a refreshing break from his kind of movies. It still contains elements of the supernatural/fantasy in it, but it manages to add a little bit more in terms of variety to the mere five films that this man has made. Admittedly, it does contain its fair share of flaws, but it still works as a reasonably entertaining movie that should satisfy most M. Night Shyamalan fans.The movie opens with a brief tale illustrated by hand drawn cave-wall style paintings, explaining how the people of the land and the people of the sea used to be united, but eventually man left and forgot about his friend in the sea. Then we move on to The Cove, an apartment complex with Paul Giamatti as its superintendent. Eventually Paul Giamatti finds that a narf named Story, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, one of these sea creatures, has come to him for some reason that he has yet to figure out.Lady in the Water's biggest strength is its wide library of characters. As usual, Shyamalan shows his talent for making each character endearing and as real as possible. Every single character in Giamatti's apartment complex is as believable as a real person. They are fleshed out, well acted, and played with such fun, intensity, and sheer talent by the actors that they never come off as gimmicks or boring one-note characters. Paul Giamatti's stuttering character is well pulled off as well. Bryce Dallas Howard seemed worse off than she was in The Village - her role as Story requires a minimum of acting, so I found that aspect slightly disappointing.Another strength of Lady in the Water is its clear tone of pure fantasy. Never once do the characters in the movie seem to stop and think about how weird and strange all this stuff about narfs actually is. They move along with the story as needed. Though this could be regarded as a weakness, I found it insanely refreshing to find a story that isn't so determined to place itself squarely and solidly in the real world. This story is a bedtime story, as said by M. Night Shyamalan himself, and I'm willing to take it as such and leave any inhibitions or preconceptions I might have behind in regards to how good this movie actually is. Its story is good for what it is, and that is good enough for me. Though the story does contain the flaws of being generic and somewhat predictable, it is still enjoyable.The score contains just the right tone of creepy/supernatural. There are times it soars, and there are times it sizzles. Never once does it seem over-dramatic or underplayed. There were a couple of pieces of music so good that I got goosebumps. Special effects are first rate as well, though there aren't that many of them at all. When they do come up, though, they are very well done. And, of course, Shyamalan's trademark blend of laugh-out-loud funny moments interchanged with white-knuckled, nail-biting tension is here as well, strong as ever.It is hard to give Lady in the Water a score. Judging from what critics across the the country are saying, it deserves almost a big fat F - a failure in nearly every way. I don't think this is the case, though. For one, I believe Shyamalan is getting too much grief for all his work. Despite what everybody says, The Village was actually a very well done movie - it just seemed that people were determined to criticize whatever they could about the movie. Shyamalan's previous three works - The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs, were all critically lauded suspense thrillers that performed impressively well at the box-office to boot. What happened? My belief is that now people just want to hate him. For some reason, most likely due to his insane amount of talent, people are getting a little bit jealous, and he has become Hollywood critic's next designated punching bag. No matter how good Lady in the Water may have ended up being, it still would have been raked over the coals. Now, admittedly, it is a bit of a step down, but it must be taken for what it is - people are criticizing it for having such a glaring tone of fantasy, but as I said, I found that refreshing. So, in the end, whether or not you enjoy Lady in the Water is completely up to you. If you want to hate it, and you want to hate Shyamalan, and you want this to be a bad movie, it will be. However, if you go into the movie just expecting a good hour and forty minutes of suspense, humor, and drama, blended with touches of spine-chilling thrills, all the while with you rooting for Shyamalan, you will not be disappointed. Either way, if you're a Shyamalan fan, Lady in the Water is a definite must see this summer. In the end, I'll give Shyamalan points for veering away from his traditional fare, but the movie still contains flaws, and must be graded down for that. A step down from The Village? Maybe. A step up for Shyamalan? Even more likely. Props, M. Night Shyamalan. Props to you.",Lady in the Water
198,jt1999,Lady Not in the Water,1,20 September 2007,"Having heard ""Lady in the Water"" was even worse than ""The Village."" I rented it nevertheless to see beautiful Bryce Dallas Howard swimming around, as advertised, AND MENTIONED IN THE DAMN TITLE!I'm thinking of suing everyone involved for false advertising. She's never even IN the water in this film, she's OUT of the water for the entire execrable hour and a half (except for a fraction of a second where she pops up from the pool at night, not even really visible -- just a shock cut where you can't tell if it's even a man or woman).This is what's known as false advertising. Being promised one thing, and getting another. THE TITLE PROMISES A WOMAN IN THE WATER AND SHE'S NEVER IN THE GODDAMN WATER FOR THE ENTIRE MISERABLE MOVIE!!!!!Shyamalan calls this a ""bedtime story."" I guess that's because it's very good at lulling the audience to sleep.They should have called it ""Man in the Water,"" since there are at least four or five scenes with Paul Giamatti swimming around in the pool... all kinds of great underwater scenes of sexy underwater nymph Giamatti diving into the pool, climbing out of the pool, making discoveries beneath the pool -- including a great sequence where he holds his breath for about five minutes underwater. For a minute I thought I was watching a sequel to ""The Big Blue.""I don't know when it's going to happen, and I don't know how, exactly, but sooner or later, M. Night Whatshisname and all the other con artists, pranksters and thieves who foisted this sorry ass ""entertainment"" on an unsuspecting public are gonna pay. Dearly.",Lady in the Water
199,day25,Fairytale,10,7 September 2021,I'll never understand the bad reviews for this movie. I thought it was brilliant! I think it went over people's head. It's a fairytale. Fantastic cast and director. Love it.,Lady in the Water
200,m_shankar20,A Mind Game,7,23 June 2008,"Lady in the Water is a fairy tale. We get more than a hint of that in the animation sequence during the titles. In fact, the animation sequence reveals most of the plot. Then what is it that Shyamalan is trying to do with the rest of the film, having revealed the plot in first 10 minutes? He is playing a game.Fairy tales are for kids. They are not for adults. What will happen if say I, as an adult, become part of a fairy tale? What if the characters that I had heard of as a child come into being for real? I will probably dismiss the whole situation. But I can't, since the tale has became real now. I'd expect the characters to show off their magic tricks and create fireworks, but that won't happen. When I'm in the middle of it all, the magic and fireworks will hold no charm. They would be mere tools to achieve something of greater importance. All of a sudden, a fairy tale that was so much fun to hear years ago would become dull.When I look at Lady in the Water as an audience, the film evokes in me the same uneasy dullness as it would have if I were a part of it. Shyamalam makes a conscious attempt to strip down all elements of fantasy. He intentionally avoids spectacular special effects. Consider for instance the climax where the Great Eagle carries away Story. For most directors that scene would have been a special effects bonanza moment. Shyamalan just shows us the reflection of the event in the pool.Lady in the Water is a mind game. It engulfs the unassuming audience into the same state as characters of the story. It tells you the sad truth that this is how a fairy tale will look like if it were to be played out for real. And when the tale ends, you will move with your life just as you otherwise will.Lady in the Water does not have the depth you would want it to have like some intellectual interpretation of a fairy tale. At the same time, it is not just as plain as it is made out to look. A treat for all with an acquired taste of Shyamalan style of film-making.",Lady in the Water
201,endymionng,Urban Fairytale,6,15 September 2010,"Yet again director/writer MNS is preaching to us about a predestined world, where we, the puny earth folks, are pawns of the supernatural. It seems like Shyamalan has a very little faith in a humanity that can think for itself which is sad because he still is a gifted filmmaker. This one tough is not as horrendously bad as Signs, which I hated on a much deeper level because of the even more obvious religious connotations.Here we get a modern urban fairytale, but one in which the rules seems to be made up as we go along. There are an obvious need for exposition because of the multiple red herrings scattered around, but it slows the pace to a crawl in several places. I don't mind slow movies, but when everything is explained in detail, then the mystery that is essential for this kind of story vanishes completely and I feel like I am talked down to like a child, and this doesn't appear to be a movie made for children. But I guess I could be wrong... Also there are various attempts at humor, self-referential digs at critics and silly ideas that just falls flat on its face. So that is the bad stuff. Redeeming factors are the photography and the acting from especially the always reliable Paul Giamatti. But honestly I still cant see the target audience for this movie.",Lady in the Water
202,baba44713,"Now you've done it, Shymalan",4,13 October 2006,"Ever since 6th sense, I was a peculiar type of Shyamalan fan. The sense was terrific, one of the best movies I've seen. Unbreakable was, meh, enjoyable. The Signs were stupid, but there I was, defending it, because I liked the atmosphere and it's overall message was kind of nice. The Village, bashed by almost everyone, actually appealed to me. I defended it hither and tother whenever anybody attacked it as being silly and convoluted and disappointing.But now Shyamalan, oh my.. now you've done it.""Lady in Water"" is kind of a fairy tale. I say ""kind of"" because even fairy tales have some bit of logic and consistency in them and they are usually about stuff you can agree with, like witches, dragons and whatnot. ""Lady in Water"" doesn't have any logic or consistency, and deals with stuff like watery beings which are not human but actually are, with wolves made out of grass and monkeys made out of branches and let's not forget the all-time crowd pleaser, mr. giant eagle. It makes up rules and situations and drawn-out explanations as to how this things relate to each other. The rules get changed every second minute or so, and some new stuff is added, but it's all OK since A)it is all explained buy an old Korean lady and B)it involves some exotic words like ""Tatutik"" and.... I dunno, like I'm gonna bother remembering some crappy made up words.So anyway, there's this apartment complex, see, and a watery nymph or something must get out of the pool to serve as a muse for some writer (Shymalan himself) who will write The Most Important Book In The World, also known as ""Cookbook"". But some grassy wolves want to kill her. Or not, since there are some rules. But this actual one will, because he's a rogue grassy wolf and he doesn't care about the rules. He's the Dirty Harry amongst grassy wolves. But wait, things are not as simple as they seem. Apparently, this particular nymph is not just A nymph, but a special type of supernymph or something, and being a supernymph gets you nice little perks like being attacked by grassy wolves even when they shouldn't. Luckily there are branch monkey to sort things out, occasionally. These monkeys maybe exist, maybe not, because, you see, no one has ever seen them. Unlike grassy wolves and supernymphs, which pop up all the time and are pretty common stuff I guess.Following all this? Hey, wake up!! Well then. Moving along. A stuttery janitor helps the muse by searching for the writer. But that's just level 1. For his next task he must find the Guild, Puzzle Man, Healer, Guardian and.. oh, come the *beep* on, does this make ANY sense to you? At all? The movie is based on made-up story by Shyamalan who told it to his daughter. And it feels like a made-up story, the one you tell to your child, you make up things along the way, contradict yourself a few dozen times, forget what you were talking about and then put in a dragon or monkey or grassy wolf named Goopydagoogooflick to make up for it... yes, it's all nice and parently, but that just isn't cinematic material! Come on, Shymalan, what are you taking us for?Why don't I give this movie the worst possible grade? Well, it's not ALL that bad. There are some interesting characters here and there. Acting is quite nice. A few jokes work. And some pretty rare suspense scenes are terrific. But all in all it's a major disappointment.I'm not a Shyamalan fan anymore. I'm kinda embarrassed I ever was. This movie spits on every sentence I said in his defense. Shame on you Shyamalan. Stop making movies like this. Write a cookbook or something, instead.",Lady in the Water
203,kylopod,A good Giamatti performance can't save a flat and convoluted story,3,6 September 2007,"Shyamalan has had his ups and downs as a filmmaker, but all his previous films have been dependable in at least one sense: no matter how confusing they became, they always ended up revolving around a simple idea. ""Lady in the Water"" breaks that pattern, featuring a convoluted story that piles one arbitrary development upon another until finally losing any semblance of a coherent structure. The premise involves a youthful sea nymph who becomes trapped in the human world and must make her way back to her realm (which the film unwisely calls ""the Blue World""), avoiding a wolf-like creature that stands in her path. She falls into the life of a lonely middle-aged superintendent (Paul Giamatti) by appearing one night in his swimming pool, stark naked. Any disturbing sexual overtones are kept in the background. This is a bedtime story, after all.She is a ""narf,"" the wolf-thing is a ""scrunt,"" and she must wait for an eagle called the ""Great Eatlon"" before she can return home. Each of the apartment tenants has a specific role to play in the process. If any of this sounds bewildering, the movie does little to clear up the confusion. The film's rather forced attempts at allegory--such as naming the sea nymph ""Story""--only further prevent this magical world from coming alive. It's just a tangle of exotic names and arbitrary rules.Giamatti learns most of these details from an Asian woman who, due to some unexplained connection, knows a fairy tale describing Story's predicament. The woman speaks no English, however, and can communicate with Giamatti only through her daughter. This contrived plot device serves one purpose only, and that is to keep Giamatti from learning the necessary details all at once.Ever since Shyamalan's film ""The Sixth Sense"" came out, I've heard occasional detractors complain that they figured out the main plot secret early on. My response is, well, good for you. That only shows that the secret was well-planted. (Or that these people are good liars who don't want to admit they were fooled.) Good plot twists always rest on sound logic, giving the audience an opportunity to anticipate them even if they are cleverly concealed. ""Lady in the Water"" is unpredictable in a bad way, surprising us without rhyme or reason--and that's ironic considering the movie's message about there being a purpose in everything.Shyamalan is a religious man. He believes strongly that the universe is not random, and he uses this belief as an excuse for lazy storytelling, plugging in plot coincidences that are supposed to seem foreordained but which instead seem unconvincing because we're conscious of how he's manipulating the events. To put it another way: You can't prove God's existence by proving the storyteller's existence.I've seen other movies handle the topic of cosmic coincidence more believably than he does. His problem, present in ""Wide Awake"" and ""Signs"" as well as this film, is that he so fervently wants the audience to see meaning in the events that he doesn't allow for any other interpretation, and this limits his possibilities. He's one of the few Hollywood filmmakers willing to tackle the subject of religion and faith, but I wish he took a less dogmatic approach.The movie has another serious problem. All fantasies set in the contemporary world have to deal with the fact that people today do not generally believe in the supernatural. In most movies of this sort, the protagonist can scarcely believe what's happening, and all the other characters think he's crazy. That's not the only way of handling this plot convention, but ""Lady in the Water"" doesn't bother handling it at all. Giamatti never doubts that Story is a sea nymph, and the apartment tenants believe what he's saying almost immediately. None of the characters react the way we'd expect from ordinary human beings in such circumstances.The most absurd character, by far, is a film critic played Bob Balaban, brought into the movie for some rather unsubtle digs at that profession. His presence leads eventually to a ""Scream""-inspired moment of self-referential horror, designed to provide humor at a point when we're least expecting it, but managing to shatter the movie's already shaky sense of reality. If Charlie Kaufman's ""Adapatation"" represents the best that the self-referential genre has given us, ""Lady in the Water"" falls well at the bottom. It shows how awkward this conceit can become if handled clumsily.Giamatti is a fine actor, and the core of sympathy he brings to his character makes the film watchable even as the events around him become increasingly ludicrous. His performance is all the more remarkable when you consider that his character is underwritten. He has some terrible experiences in his past (paralleling those of the Mel Gibson character in ""Signs""), but he never feels fleshed out.Bryce Dallas Howard, as the sea nymph, disappointed me, especially after her promising turn in ""The Village."" In that film, her clipped and stilted speech was part of the faux-nineteenth-century effect that the movie wanted to evoke. Here it's out of place, and it makes her character distant and hard to relate to, which is fatal to her relationship with Giamatti.Shyamalan still does a good job creating mood and atmosphere in many scenes. But the film is plagued by so many flaws that I'm not sure it ever could have worked. The storyline is intrinsically artificial and contrived, and he doesn't build up enough of a human base that we can overlook this fact.",Lady in the Water
204,jay632,"Boring.... not scary, and not suspenseful",4,25 July 2006,"Boring.... not scary, and not suspenseful, this is not a film that you expect from this director. I always rate the movies by how good the plot was and put everything else to one side. The plot wasn't any good. I wasn't scary, the scariest part was hearing dogs grin, not suspenseful, more like a regular movie with just lots of talking.Actors didn't do nothing in this movie to help, i didn't feel that any of the characters did anything too special to help make this movie better, sub par acting and boring storyline. Having so many multicultural actors in this film might not of been the best of idea. I know it portrays more realism, but lets face it, majority of the audience is white. And audience are more use to see white characters and maybe a black character on the side.The sound of the movie is OK, he tried to make this movie more suspenseful, but the plot didn't allow for it to happen.",Lady in the Water
205,scrapmetal7,"a long, nicely filmed chunk of gibberish",3,20 May 2007,"THE LADY IN THE WATER has some major problems, the biggest being the decision to include a lot of convoluted exposition to the events, which is clumsily dumped in throughout the film. A little old Asian woman gives the protagonist reams and reams of information, all of which explains the water lady's situation in great detail, but we're supposed to accept that it all comes from an old bedtime story. It would have to have been the longest and most pointless bedtime story ever.Secondly, there is really not so much a story as there is an initial idea and the feeling that they made it all up as they went along. The movie is kind of like a fun, low-budget fantasy adventure film from the '80's, like MONSTER SQUAD, or ET, or TROLL, or MAC AND ME, where kids find an ET or a baby dragon and have to help it get home. Unfortunately, LADY replaces the kids with irritating adults, the creature with a boring wet girl, and taxes our patience with its senseless, meandering logic. This film (wrongly) takes itself more seriously than those '80's movies did themselves, and the result is a nicely filmed chunk of contrived boredom.Bryce Dallas Howard may be talented, but you can't tell here. She may be the least interesting magical movie creature ever. Paul Giamatti is fine, but suddenly, he is revealed, for some reason, to have suffered the exact same tragedy that Kevin Spacey suffered in K-Pax. This development doesn't really fit, and takes a lot away from his nice portrayal of a normal misfit. It seems to have been thrown in halfway through just in case the audience didn't like his character yet.All in all, I was so glad when this movie was over.",Lady in the Water

207,edge547,"Not very good, but shockingly strange",2,5 December 2016,"M. Night Shyamalan, the director of this film, started his career off on a high note with The Sixth Sense, which was his first film that anyone can remember. It was clever and everyone loved it. Unfortunately, his follow-up films kept getting progressively worse and worse, although none seemed truly terrible until his career took a real nosedive with Lady in the Water.There are a few of movies I've seen that start with the characters in the film watching a different film or TV program. The action opens on the fictional film-within-a-film, and the audience is momentarily tricked into believing that it's the film they came to watch, as in Blow Out and Sullivan's Travels. It's usually pretty easy to spot, because the film-within-a-film often feels fake. Just as films rarely feel quite like real life, the film-within-a-film rarely feels quite like a real film. In the case of Lady in the Water, I kept waiting for the moment when we realized that we were just watching a fake film that the characters in the real movie were watching. That moment never came. The whole film just felt so strange that I couldn't believe it would be made, marketed, and released as a real movie. I felt betrayed by the director and the theater for taking my money and wasting my time.Lady in the Water is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan wrote for his kids. He should not have made it into a film, but I guess he thought it would be a good idea, so he did. Even after the strange beginning, the movie just keeps getting weirder and weirder, and it's never particularly enjoyable. However, it's never quite as boring as it could be, as the strangeness has its own appeal in a way. I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and found myself wondering what nonsense they would throw at us next. How would they outdo themselves in the next scene?Still, it's only appealing—for lack of a better term—for so long, after which it just becomes tiring and nauseating. At one point in the film I decided that my time would be better spent doing something else, so I decided to close my eyes and take a nap. Sleep is very important, you see. I woke up during a scene in which the lead characters decipher secret codes that are hidden in the text and images on the backs of cereal boxes. I thought I was dreaming. I really thought that I must have surely been asleep and dreaming, but I was not. I'd slept through the gradual increase in weirdness and had taken too big of leap all at once. And my brain couldn't handle what my eyes were seeing, so it told me I was dreaming.Lady in the Water is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly one of the worst. Still, I have to respect the director's decision to make the film he wanted to make despite how different and strange it was. It's just too bad that it turned out so terrible.",Lady in the Water
208,Westeire,M. Night Shyamalan.. A real artist in the making.,10,29 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan. I have seen all his movies. He is a real artist. Highly recommend any of his films.

Of course if you are looking for high budget load with special effects well then rent starwars. Shyamalan is an excellent director. In short. SEE THE FILM.. I really don't want to praise it too much to avoid the suspense. My personal opinion when a Shyamalan film comes out DON'T listen to the critics or read the reviews, JUST GO A SEE IT!!> Really you won;t be disappointed",Lady in the Water
209,CMUltra,It's all in the ending.,6,22 July 2006,"The ending is the crucial part of any movie. And, since M. Night Shyamalan has established the ending as the high point of his films, I was particularly watching the final moments here. Disappointingly, Shyamalan delivers a few very weak, very easy to spot ""twists"" tied up in a Hollywood Happy Ending.I've nothing against happy endings but, with Shyamalan, I expect the ending, whatever type it may be, to have quite a punch. The rest of the movie has the quality we've come to expect from Shyamalan. Tight direction, angles and shots that not only look good but also become part of the storytelling, and a layered script all add up to a fun and very interesting ride. Unfortunately the ride runs out of gas rather than coming to a final destination.Shyamalan takes a good stab at the fantasy genre here and doesn't waste any time establishing belief amongst the characters. They all quickly accept and then begin to act upon the proposition that Story is a real life fairy-tale creature, come to benefit them and mankind as a whole. Their belief seems too abrupt but it's clear that Shyamalan wanted to dive right into the story. I would have liked just a little more cynicism from the humans though. If he had set the story in the past their immediate acceptance may have been more plausible. But in current day Philadelphia? I just don't see that many folks accepting a fantasy being at face value.The writing is a good bit more humorous than his past scripts. There are a good many chuckles and even a few laugh out loud moments. Giamatti is in a role tailor made for him and he carries it with no problems. Howard shows a suitable sense of wonder and innocence as Story. The rest of the cast, a fairly large group of characters, are solid as well. Shyamalan writes himself into his largest role to date and does quite well.Overall I can't say it's a bad movie. The Shyamalan quality alone puts this above most of the competition. However, he has set himself a pretty high standard with his earlier films and this one falls short.",Lady in the Water
210,luke-346,Purely for the adults who are really children at heart!,6,29 January 2007,"If you're unfamiliar with M. Night's previous work then you are probably going to enjoy this film. However, if you are familiar with the over-rated auteur then you will probably be mildly disappointed by ""Lady in the Water"". Based on a Fairytale contrived by M. Night himself, but alleges that it is based on Asian folklore, which in itself is unoriginal as we are more than used to American Cinema ripping off Asian horror in all its forms. M Night might have been trying to make a political statement here about American Cinema but I doubt it as it wouldn't gel well with the rest of the picture.I have to say that I am familiar with his work and therefore I was slightly disappointed. Unfortunately, to begin with, the film isn't as original as some would have you believe and has been influenced by other films most notably Neil Jordan's ""The Company of Wolves"" (which is a much better take on the fairytale genre, and scarier  probably because it was made in a day when film-making wasn't so compromised in favour of the Studio's required audience age). ""Lady in the Water"" tries too hard to complicate the genre by fulfilling the unnecessary need to re-invent itself. Folklore, legend, myths etc are what they are because of the time and generations they have taken to evolve and it is a very difficult task to try and construct your own in 90mins. The Lady in the Water fairytale has no substance or back-up; it cannot relate itself to anything that an audience could familiarise with - only that we all have a purpose which is a common theme in any story. The drawing together of the people in the apartment building reminded me of ""Batteries Not Included"", a far more enjoyable family piece about people joining together whilst sharing a single goal.I also don't believe the film to be as well constructed as his previous efforts with a superfluous use of extended pull-focus shots towards the beginning of the film that served no narrative purpose; furthermore the manner in which the sound was employed throughout was poor as the whispering was too gratuitous and therefore hampered the plot too much as it was felt everything that was a said was a 'secret' that has to be understood, and heard, in order to understand the films direction. Ultimately, and because of M. Night's desire to tell a bran-new fairytale, the film has a plot that only an adult would understand and the visuals that only a child would enjoy.

In fact I had no expectations at all except that Paul Giamatti was in it and so it couldn't be that bad right?Wrong.Suffice to say that sitting through this meandering, self-indulgent bilge was a torture. The plot appeared to be made up as it went along, didn't make sense half the time and completely lacked any sort of motivation other than the rather obvious and trite ""everyone has something to contribute"". I agree with this philosophy, but I happen to believe that what some people have to contribute is silence.Groaning is an irritating thing to do when you're in the company of someone else, but honestly, I couldn't help it.It was especially painful to see Paul Giamatti (the only talent in the movie) trying to carry the movie. Despite his talents, he couldn't pull it off.In the DVD extras (thankfully, I rented this one and wont be buying it) it is explained to us that this movie was written for children as well as adults, supposedly as a contemporary fairytale. ""Oh!"" I thought. ""Thats why we don't get it"" But showing it to our nieces just highlighted the movies failure here too: Its too complex and irritating even for children. They developed behavioural problems and have needed counselling ever since.Paul, what WERE you thinking? We were happy to see you turn up in The Illusionist. It restored our faith in you!",Lady in the Water
212,Cube_TX,Shyamalan's best in years,6,18 July 2006,"I expected absolutely nothing from this movie after being bored to death by The Village. It seemed that Shyamalan was writing the ending twists to his movies first, then writing the story around it. I didn't really want to see Lady in the Water, but had free tickets to the local premiere. This movie, however, breaks from Shyamalan's regular scripts and has sense of originality about it. I was impressed by how outright funny this movie was at many times. I was very impressed by the writing because it showed a different side to M. Night Shyamalan's talent. Shyamalan plays a larger role in this movie and does a decent job.The star of this film, and the outright reason that it was enjoyable, was Paul Giamatti. I have seen him in many films, but never in the leading role. He was funny, emotional and strong throughout the entire film. This film is a testament to his greatness as an actor. I would hope that this will result in another Academy Award nomination for him. Perhaps it was because of Giamatti's lead, but many other lesser known actors were also impressive as a result. Bryce Dallas Howard did a good job in her role, but it was probably better that Giamatti was given more camera time and lines.True, the monsters look fake... but what does a ""real"" monster really look like? This movie, however, is NOT horror. Much like The Village, the trailers are misleading. Shyamalan should hire someone new to do his promotions. Anyone expecting a scary movie will be very disappointed. Unlike The Village, this movie was never boring. Believe it or not, it's safe to take the kids to this one. There is no gore or graphic violence.Is this a fantastic movie? No, but you will be entertained and surprised by some of the great acting jobs. I would call this Shyamalan's best work since The Sixth Sense.",Lady in the Water

This is the work of a petulant multimillionaire boy who won't take no for an answer. Hollywood creates monsters of all shapes and sizes but this one is kind of unique. Did you see the steam of arrogance covering him through his American Express commercial? The Lady In The Water is populated by a fauna of Fellinesque caricatures and Shaymalan's ego. Images that go nowhere and a story - if you pardon the expression - trying desperately to recreate the box office bonanza of The Sixth Sense with a series of unfulfilled promises leading to a final twist that is anything but. All that said and done. I wasn't bored.",Lady in the Water
216,Solipsisticblog,Interesting misfire martyrs director,6,24 July 2006,"Press on this movie prior to its release stated that it was a meta-fairytale: fairytale characters realize they are living in a fairytale and then take an active role in finishing their story. Shyamalan's tale, though, isn't nearly that brainy or post-modern. It's a story about fairy tales, myths, the fantastic being very real and having faith in the existence of the supernatural. It's an incredibly earnest faith tale that's even more didactic than ""Signs."" Once again we find Shyamalan inserting the fantastic into the mundane. This time, Shyamalan constructs a very complicated mythology full of narfs, elons, scrunts, and the Tartutic--all invented by the writer, producer, director. As the story proceeds, Shyamalan keeps expanding upon and modifying this mythology. ""Oh wait! Sometimes scrunts will attack narfs, if the narf is a maiden."" This plays like ""The Princess Bride"" without the irony. (Or exactly like Episodes I-III of the Star Wars series.) Your enjoyment of the movie will depend on how much of this you can tolerate. I was refreshed by the movie because of its novelty, the outstanding cast (Paul Giamatti, Jeffrey Wright, Bob Balaban), and Shyamalan's ambition. I did find it a bit ponderous, though, particularly Bryce Dallas Howard as the narf. She is so pure, so virginal, and very boring. She is merely a device, but is on screen for about 2/3rds of the movie.(SPOILERS)The larger point of the movie, though, seems to be that M. Night Shyamalan is a brave visionary whose work angers some, but is of the utmost importance to mankind. The narf--water nymph--is discovered in the pool of The Cove apartment complex by Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), the super. He discovers that many of the residents of The Cove have a role to play in helping to complete the narf's mission. The mission of the narf, ultimately, is to inspire actor/director/writer M. Night Shyamalan, playing struggling writer Vick Ran, to complete his master work. He learns that his work will change mankind for the better, but will make him a martyr. This will either anger you, or you will be able to look past it, but it ultimately makes the movie about massaging the director's ego.(SPOILERS END) An interesting misfire that I look forward to seeing again. I just find Shyamalan's work wholly hypnotic even when he fails.",Lady in the Water
217,jashezilla,An original film full of heart.,7,23 September 2019,"Read so many reviews saying that this movie sucks, but surprisingly it's probably one of my favorite Shyamalan films. Awesome characters, a thought-out story and at it's heart, a film about love, heart-break and forgiveness.",Lady in the Water
218,mronrox45,a masterpiece for M. Night fans,10,1 November 2011,"I've come to the conclusion that there are 3 ways to feel about M. Night movies. 1. You love everything he does. 2. You hate everything he does. And 3. No matter if you love or hate his movies you still liked The Sixth Sense. M. Night is a lot like Rod Sterling in that hes always taking chances with his movies so its either a hit or miss in a commercial sense. If you are a serious fan of comics than you loved Unbreakable. If you don't care for comics it probably didn't make much sense and you were a little confused. This movie was one for bedtime story lovers. If you really didn't get into them as a child or your parents didn't read them to you it probably isn't going to be your cup of tea. However, my grandfather read all the classics to me as a child and this movie was a testament to going back to those Saturday nights when I would stay at their house and he would read them to me, doing all the voices of course. This is a good movie for the whole family. Laughs and mystery for the adults and good olé storybook whimsy for the kids.",Lady in the Water
219,SugarandIce,Creativety requires proper execution.,6,22 March 2015,"If I were to offer Shyamalan some praise it would be that despite his obsession with twists and odd dialogue, he at least makes an attempt to make original works. Lady in the Water is bold in that regard and I applaud him for it. In theory, it would make for a pretty entertaining film. Unfortunately, the execution falters heavily.Characters in this film do not act like people, they lack any human response to the childlish fairytale-like situations thrown at them. There is no sense that a fairytale has entered our world, no raised eyebrows here. The fairytale itself being taught is just too random and sporadic. Fantasy, even the most creative, make an effort to pull us into the fantastic, and make us believe these worlds and rules to be real. What happens in this film though is total disconnect. Characters are not relatable, nor interesting enough to merit this. The exposition is clumsy, lazy, and lengthy. The story is random and lacks any structure. The dialogue is awkward, as if written by some other-worldy being attempting to mimic the human race. To the counter argument of ""a fairytale is allowed to be childish and fun and fantastic"", let me retort by pointing out that I've read and watched fairy tales more grounded and competent then this. There is no excuse for the poor storytelling of this film. Bryce Dallas Howard does her best, bless her soul, but this film is beyond saving.",Lady in the Water
220,moviegeek310,Shyamalan's Third Best!,7,23 July 2006,"In viewing trailers of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" one couldn't tell if it was a horror story, or a fairy tale. Knowing M. Nigh, it was probably a mixture of both, with a little humor thrown in. That's the good thing about this director; you always know what kind of movie to expect. Of course, that can also be bad, because you'll end up setting your expectations high. And after his other films my expectations were very high. For the most part, I was satisfied. This definitely wasn't his best film, that honor would go to ""Unbreakable"" a true masterpiece. In second would be ""Signs"", then this in a close third. ""Lady in the Water"" originated as a tale Shyamalan told his kids as a bedtime story. Though, it is a complicated plot that involves a water creature named Story that needs the help of a kindly hotel superintendent named Cleveland Heap. I still haven't quite figured out why though, to tell you the truth, I sort of forgot. This story was very polluted. One aspect that really made this film enjoyable was Paul Giamatti as Cleveland. No matter what role he plays, he always stands out. T o say the least, he is amazing. Other characters include a man who only exercises one side of his body, five surfer dudes who sit in their room and have ""intelligent"" conversations, a disgruntled movie critic, and many others who add comic relief in an otherwise dark fairytale. One thing I really like about M. Night's films is that he makes you a part of the movie by his use genius camera moves. By not using fast movements or changing angles he makes you feel as if you are a character watching everything unfold. One thing I don't quite enjoy is that he gave himself a big role in this film. I mean really. It was cool that Hitchcock would throw himself in the background, but giving yourself a huge role? Come on! At least he isn't a horrible actor. Aside from that I love how he put in a moral, just as in any fairytale. The moral is: Everyone has a purpose in this life, no matter how small they think they are. Mr. Heap really struggles with that at first, but ends up doing amazing things, and discovers he does, in fact, belong. It was quite an uplifting film actually. Another thing that didn't go over quite so well was the believability factor. The critics have been roasting this film because of that, I'm not. But I certainly see where they are coming from. The movie goes from, ""ok, I can believe that"" to, ""what the heck?"" But the rest of the film definitely makes up for the ending. Plus M. Night's films have always been about the characters, not about the story. And for those worried about the horror aspect of it, there's no need to worry too much. Sure, there are jump scenes, but nothing that'll knock you out of your seat. Overall, I think Shyamalan did admirably. If it wasn't for the muddled story, and the sometimes ridiculous scenes then it would beat ""Signs"". ""Lady in the Water"" is rated PG-13 for some frightening moments.",Lady in the Water
221,lerkim,Some Of The Best Work Ever Made,9,28 February 2007,"See i do not enjoy all of M Night's movies but this one kept me on the edge of the seat. It goes upon the meaning Purpose well you will see what i mean. This movie was directed like no other and the cast was excellent i enjoyed seeing Paul Giamatti act in this movie, because i normally do not think he is so good as an actor. But this movie turned it all around his acting is incredible he was so real i really felt with him in this movie and Bryce Dalles Howard well let us just say they picked the right one well now for the storyline.Well it all happens in an apartment where Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is an superintendent, one night he hears sounds outside from the pool he falls into the pool and are saved by a narf her name is story (Bryce Dalles Howard). She tells him that she is from the blue world somewhere, she is the highest narf called Madam Narf but we will first know that later on and the people around the apartment are all meant to help her but no more will i tell now to the soundtrack.the music is all done greatly it is fitting perfectly to the movie and the song at the end is not bad at all.Well i think i have said what i want see this movie and i know you cannot let your eyes stop looking away this movie will capture everything in you.",Lady in the Water
222,MovieRat-2,"Not Night's best, but still an enjoyable story",7,23 July 2006,"It goes without saying that we as an audience have stereotyped Night when it comes to what types of films he make: a sort of Hitchcockian suspense with the eventful twist ending. What surprising sets Lady apart from all of his previous films is that there is not twist ending! Well, at least not the reality altering twist that we have seen in Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and The Village. And unlike all his previous films, Lady stumbles in the realm of believability. Yes, I know there is supposed to be ""suspension of disbelief"" but this story forces us to believe so many absurd circumstances that you laugh at most of the film. This doesn't mean that it isn't an enjoyable and decent bit of storytelling. To best describe the story, it is a fable-like bedtime story played out within the confines of a modern day apartment complex. A stuttering superintendent discovers that the culprit of unauthorized night swimming in the complex pool is in reality a water nymph on a noble quest to deliver a message vital to the human race. Only when this task is complete will she be allowed to be taken home by a great eagle. But in her way are these earth beasts who have vowed to kill her at all costs. To help her complete her task the super must find individuals within the complex who are destined to fulfill the roles of certain fable characters...all in the span of 2 or 3 days. It is in discovering the identity of these special characters that we have our ""twist"" (if you can even call that) and the source of most our laughs. You can't help but laugh at how willingly these normal (well...most of them are normal) everyday people accept their new found roles without question or argument. Despite all this, we are treated to pretty good bit of storytelling that is enjoyable for almost everybody. Some scenes may be to frightening for young kids but don't worry parents, there is no gore, no language, and hardly any violence (at least visible violence). If I were to put an age limit I would say 10 years old without any problems. Given a 7 for the serious problems of suspension of disbelief.",Lady in the Water

Sadly it almost put me to sleep. Paul Giamatti was not a great leading man IMO, I should have learned my lesson from suffering through Sideways.M.

224,GrimmBrother,An unintentionally funny mess,3,24 December 2006,"If you are interested in fast paced action packed movies that are filled with suspense, then you will hate Lady in the Water.The film is about a man named Cleveland who is the caretaker of a block of flats. One night, he spots someone, or more likely something swimming in the pool. The thing in the pool turns out to be the Lady in the Water whose name is Story.She is a narf (sea nymph) from a mystical land called Blue World. She is being chased by a scrunt. The only thing a scrunt fears is a tartutic, which is a bloodthirsty, monkey-like creature.Story needs to get back to her home, the Blue World, but in order for this to happen, she needs to be collected by the Great Eatlon, which will only come when all of Story's helpers, who all happen to be from the apartment blocks, are identified.Director Shyamalan tries to do a JK Rowling by making up words for the creatures in this film, but as you can see, it seriously doesn't work for him. Narf, scrunt, tartutic and Great Eatlon. What was he smoking? Like the names of the creatures, this film is absolutely ridiculous. M Night Shyamalan seriously needs a new writer for his movies. The dialog and action are so slow. A 90 year old could run faster than the way this film unfolds. It is funny and silly in all the wrong places. You probably won't see anything else like it for the rest of the year, and you will be happy about it. I salute Disney for not taking on this film.They obviously knew what they were doing. Lady in the Water had nothing good about it, except perhaps the good acting from Paul Giamatti. It is amazing how he could keep a straight face while saying Shyamalan's terrible dialog.I am officially off Shyamalan films. The Sixth Sense was the only film of his which wasn't that bad. But then came Signs, which was quite a mess. The Village was a disaster and so is this.It only received 24% from critics at Rotten Tomatoes and it is only getting 3/10 from me. One for Paul Giamatti, one for the unintended humor and another one for the scrunts, which I really liked.The King of the Surprise Ending ended this film with me thinking ""Is that it?"" That was probably the twist.",Lady in the Water
225,formicidae,Good Entertainment,8,23 July 2006,"Shyamalan continues to make interesting movies that are enjoyable to watch. Unfortunately, he is the victim of his own success, and it's hard not to compare ""Lady"" against his other, probably better, films. I personally don't think this picture has the suspense of ""Sixth Sense"", or the character depth of ""Unbreakable"" for example. (On the other hand, I found it more imaginative than ""Signs"" and more complex than ""Village"".)Ultimately, ""Lady in the Water"" it is different, it is interesting, and I think well worth meandering through. I give it something between a 7 and an 8.",Lady in the Water

""Lady In The Water"" meant much to M. Night Shayamalan and his kids, but as to the Joe Q. Public, they did not get it. Some will say I am nuts, but that is okay. This movie has more to it than what you see. Mr. Heep with his stuttering has me on edge, but his character changes every time he is around Story - he improves. I enjoy each of the characters as they are portrayed and interact with each other, real life to me. The down side comes from the evil Scrunt, who I must say when he tries to nab Story, it was like Jaws for the first time. I jumped, and I still do ever time. As to Mr. Heep's underwater breathing abilities, somewhat far-fetched but still pushing it, remember this is a children's story so some latitude needs to be allowed.

227,he_who_leads,Its all Make Believe,5,3 July 2007,"The setting is an apartment complex called 'The Cove.' Ordinary, kinda sad building superintendent Cleveland Heep discovers a lady in the apartment pool. She's from another place - The Blue World - and she is here to awaken a certain person and help return the world to good.Your enjoyment of 'Lady in the Water' will depend on whether or not you can surrender logic and believability and just believe. I'm not just talking about the strong fantasy elements with all the talk of narfs, scrunts and magical healing mud. I'm talking about narrative and character plausibility being almost entirely thrown out the window so that the film can dramatically move ahead. For example, Cleveland learns nearly all the rules about Story and her world through a 50-something year old Chinese woman, who knows because the information was passed down to her. Soon, everyone in The Cove is trying to do everything they can to help Cleveland and Story out, no questions asked. People hang around their apartments all the time, waiting to be drawn into the story, as if they've never gone anywhere else in their lives.So why would anyone enjoy this, you ask? Well first of all, there's a certain suspension of belief that we all like in the movies, right? I mean, we know that the characters of 'Lost' should look 10 times more scruffy after all that time on the Island, but do we really really want them to look that way? For those who can just ride with it, there are some good things to report. Paul Giamatti gives another strong performance as the stuttering, everyday hero and Bryce Dallas Howard is believable without saying much as the quiet, fragile Story. They have great chemistry and the supporting roles are quite fun. Even Shyamalan himself is good in his mandatory acting turn. And though I spent the first 2/3's dealing with the above issues, the last 1/3 is filled with stately and dramatic moments. With this film, Shyamalan successfully seems to tap into the confusion, despair, hope and yearning in these current troubled times, hinted at in the wonderfully simple opening monologue and the glimpses of the Iraq war on the news. The characters all want to have a purpose in life and they all want to do good. They all want to rally around each other and work together. They want to rebel. By the end of the film, those implausible things I mentioned earlier seem less important (but still there).The true star of this film is the score by James Newton Howard. Also working with Shyamalan on his previous films (sixth sense, unbreakable, village), Howard's score soars, moves, surprises and thrills.End verdict: Not as sharp as 'The Sixth Sense,' not as fun as 'Signs' and having the kind of murky logic of the 'Village.' However, it has a lot of trademark Shyamalan stuff and if you've generally liked his past work and you're willing to give your plausibility radar a good push down, or have a low one to begin with, then you could see this film and enjoy it.",Lady in the Water
228,motta80-2,"A pleasant surprise, his best since Unbreakable",8,20 April 2007,"I just saw this on rental last night and I was massively and pleasantly surprised that I loved it. I like Sixth Sense (loved it on first viewing but it doesn't hold up), love Unbreakable (with gets better with every viewing, like Tarantino's undervalued Jackie Brown), but Signs was only okay and I hated The Village, dull, obvious. Only redeeming feature was Bryce Dallas Howard who was very good.So after the BVI blow-up and all the critical drubbing I didn't bother to even go see Lady in the Water, and as someone who averages 150-200 films per year in the cinema you have to be pretty poor to be left out. But i just thought, why bother? But you know what I don't regret it for a moment because i think that lowering of expectations and time removal from both studio hype and critical vitriol helped.Lady in the Water is a beautiful, lyrical movie. Badly, but not surprising, miss-sold by the studio as a usual Night twisty thriller this is a fairy-tale, like a serious Princess Bride. It easily sweeps you along as a group of mythological archetype characters build a sweet, emotional story. Chris Doyle's haunting cinematography, James Newton Howard's melodic score and pitch perfect performances from a completed invested cast make for a delightful movie.I can't help but think that this movie made exactly the same but by someone else without Shyamalan's pre-existing reputation would not have been attacked to the same degree. Critics didn't like that he made himself a key actor and that he had a movie critic character in there obviously but more than that I think it's just not a movie you can see with any expectations.I had none. I had all but forgotten about it but I saw Spider-Man 3 the day before which rekindled my Bryce Dallas love and I thought oh, i'll give Lady a go.And the performances in this? Howard gets exactly the right mix of strange and intriguing with power and purpose. Jeffrey Wright is wonderful in an understated role. All the ensemble is strong. But Paul Giamatti, wow! He has this one sensational emotional scene in the final act (I won't give spoilers about why, how or what) that is extraordinary. He's heartbreaking. I haven't cried in a movie without an animal getting hurt since I was a child but his power genuinely moved me to tears, I was so invested in the man.Give it a chance. It won't be for everyone. It's really a very indie sensibility movie hiding in the guise of a studio thriller. It's a fairy-tale, literally as it says ""a bedtime story"" and should be approached in that manner.

Monkeys, rabid dogs, a swimming pool and a bunch of hippies - only Night Shyamallan could manage to use all of these in the same scene.When a person makes one remarkable movie that are followed suit by a series of incredibly overrated and over-analyzed projects that would be on-par with a B+ film school presentation, one is left wondering when will Night get the hint? Apart from the Sixth Sense, his every movie since has been progressively declining in quality. Becoming much worse than the predecessor and the only thing they seem to have in common is the underlying message of everyone's purpose in life. Well if his own purpose is to ultimately get awful then he has been very successful.Shyamallan is definitely the luckiest most overrated director in Hollywood. Being the man in the right place at the right time, he managed to score it big with The Sixth Sense. He should have stopped there and remain a legend.As for Lady in the Water, it's not even worth mentioning apart from my introductory sentence.

The critics have been Luke warm toward this film, so I did not know what to expect but I wanted to see it because it was produced by M. Night Shyamalan.I love the creativity and imagination Shyamalan brings to his movies. It's not about special effects or spectacular fights; there is a real story and a purpose to it, as in his other movies.Paul Giamati's character (Cleveland Heep) finds a sea nymph in the swimming pool of the apartment complex he manages. He tries to help her go back but there are dangers outside. Eventually he is able to get help from many of his tenants to accomplish the goal. In the process everyone learns something. Cleveland works out the pain from his past.I loved the fairytale type narration. The story unfolds gradually, and Shyamalan has done a good job as director and actor (he has a substantial role in this). He is one of the best story tellers of our time. Whether you like the movie or not, he is very original and his movies always have a message.The suspense was in 'who is who'- the guardian, the healer, the guild, etc. Every character we saw in the beginning had a purpose in the end. If not for great acting by Paul Giamati and Bryce Dallas Howard, this movie would not have been half as effective. I hope Giamati will get an Oscar nomination this year. His speech toward the end, addressed to his family, made me cry.I really enjoyed this movie. I was riveted throughout because it kept unveiling new things. M.Night Shyamalan has done it again- an original, creative, entertaining movie. Well done.",Lady in the Water
234,adudewhoiscool,A unique fairytale,8,5 February 2007,"""Lady in the Water"" was the most underrated film of 2006. Whether you like M. Night or not, you have to appreciate the fact that he is one of the rare original filmmakers in Hollywood today and this movie is no different. If you have enjoyed M. Night Shyamalan's other films, you will like ""Lady in the Water."" However, if you expect a suspenseful thriller like ""The Sixth Sense,"" you will be disappointed. This movie is a bedtime story/ fairy tale, and that is all you should expect from it.Cleveland Heep is an ordinary apartment superintendent. Until one day, he discovers a woman named Story swimming in the complex's swimming pool after curfew. Cleveland soon learns that she is a ""Narf,"" who comes from the Blue World and has a message for humanity. Will he be able to help Story complete her mission? As mentioned earlier, ""Lady in the Water"" is a bedtime story/ fairy tale. As a fairy tale, or bedtime story, this movie forces you to suspend belief, which may be a negative thing, depending on who you are. In addition, many things are not explained as well as they could have, thus it forces you to use your imagination in order to fill in the gaps. Nonetheless, if you view ""Lady in the Water"" through the eyes of a child, you will enjoy it.The acting was very good. You really do care about the characters and you like them. Bryce Dallas Howard, who was in M. Night's ""The Village,"" was great as a ""Narf"" named Story. Paul Giamatti was enjoyable as the stuttering Cleveland Heep. In addition, just like in every movie M. Night movie, Shyamalan is in this film, but this time it is a bigger role then a cameo. The rest of the actors did well too.There are very few negatives to this movie. Some people might complain about how this story causes you to suspend belief. Those same people will probably not like how some things are not explained well. Most people will probably complain about Shyamalan's ego by casting himself as a writer whose work would eventually change the world. The biggest problem with this movie, which is the same problem ""The Village"" has, is that it was falsely marketed as a horror movie.Overall, if you are a fan of M. Night, you would probably like this movie. If you want a movie that has great acting, and various plot twists that will keep you guessing throughout the movie, all wrapped up in a bedtime type story, go see this. You will not regret it. Do not listen to the critics and do not expect this to be another version of ""The Sixth Sense."" ""Lady in the Water"" is recommended!",Lady in the Water

236,cwfultz,We could change the world...,10,3 August 2006,"In a time of great disrest in this country comes a film called ""Lady In the Water"", a simple bedtime story that suggests one thing: We all have a purpose.In this film, there is a character called a Narf. The purpose of the Narf is to help someone. They have one specific person. In this case, it is a writer that must be helped. Once the person comes in contact with the Narf, they feel an awakening. Then, they are inspired to do something. In this case, it's write a book. The book in question is entitled ""The Cookbook"" and it contains the writer's opinions on the many things wrong in the world. Perhaps philosophy? Anyway, the Narf has the ability to tell the future and the Narf in this, Story, tells the writer that his book will inspire a boy to become president of the U.S. and make great changes.This is what I like to call a co-plot. The other co-plot is Story's journey and struggle to get back to the Blue World and how everyone who is designated a certain part of the bedtime story helps her.How amazing is that? This movie inspired me to do something great. It might not be become president, but it will be something good. This movie was so wonderful. It's message rang true and clear, and I fell in love with it. For anyone who is able to embrace change and is open to one of the most (if not the most) unique films in history, ""Lady In the Water"" will amaze you. It did me.",Lady in the Water
237,oldgirl,an open letter to the director,9,29 July 2006,"Sir, Thank you. Thank you for reinforcing the idea that the world is a far more complex place than we think it might be. Thank you for nudging our psyches with the suspicion and the hope that our place and our role in the universe is not only uncertain, but may actually be of vital importance. This movie celebrates the implication that somewhere, lurking just beneath the surface of the mundane, there is immense magic waiting for its moment. Thank you for encouraging us to suspend disbelief and sustain a deeply resonant innocence. Thank you for offering us the illogical logic of dreams, and for clarifying these paradoxes in such beautiful cinematography. The critics have been calling this a terribly self-indulgent film, and it is. Thank you for indulging us, the dreamers of dreams.",Lady in the Water
238,Mxzplk,M. Night Shyamalan used to be a synonymous to good surprises,6,26 August 2006,"When The Sixth Sense arrived at the movie theaters, the Indian-American M. Night Shyamalan instantly became a huge artistic promise. For each new film, however, his name evokes more frustration - and Lady in the Water won't revert this negative expectation. The excellent Paul Giamatti, the only element of the film that doesn't deserve any complains, interprets Cleveland Heep, a caretaker of a small apartments condominium, so well-meaning as solitary. Cleveland has a suspicion that someone is using the swimming pool late in the night, far from the allowed schedule. But what he finds in it is no nocturnal athlete, but a nymph named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, of The Village). Story is there to fulfill a mission: awaken in a writer a spark that will be decisive for the future of humanity. Who is this writer she doesn't know yet, and also can't tell about the designed people that are supposed to protect her from the dangers surrounding her task. Her main clue is a korean lady that recalls of a similar situation in a fairy tale that her mother used to narrate. And, by this point, the mess is already installed. In the scale of the impossible, to propose communication with the dead or alien invasions is one thing; but nymphs in swimming pools, expecting a big eagle to come for the rescue is other entirely - a tempting invitation for the involuntary humor, and one more good reason to discuss what is, after all, the gift that would make Shyamalan become as special as people thought.There is at least two ways of looking at his films: from his own point of view, as the story he pretends to tell; and of the auditorium's prism, of the movie that they are really watching. In his good moments, Shyamalan is great precisely because of the way he explores the distance between both points of view first, and then transposes them. It is his famous twists: the surprise that Dr. Malcolm Crowe is also one of the ghosts that only Cole Sear is capable of seeing in The Sixth Sense, or the fact that some data apparently random of Signs will reveal a step-by-step to stop an alien invasion. In his bad moments, such as Unbreakable and The Village, this distance widens - and here, becomes almost irretrievable. What makes Shyamalan fails is to demand from the audience to believe in everything and anything, without offering a hook, a seduction, or plausibility in proportional quantities. His method, at last, is always rigorously the same. Some stories adapt to it, some don't. And the one of Lady in the Water, that the director took from a fairy tale that he himself invented to put his daughters to sleep (must have worked wonderfully), it's the most absurd of them.Fairy tales are not child's play; they are powerful codifications of feelings and ancestral complexes, capable of crossing centuries and civilizations with its essence unchanged. Shyamalan is a talented filmmaker, that knows how to fit his images and place them in a deliberate rhythm. Also has a good intention: to celebrate the way a narrative is capable of reuniting different people in the same experience. But he is no Grimm, Perrault or Le Fointane. His legend doesn't have a foot that can sustain it nor head to echo with something at least similar to the force of the stories he proposes to tell.",Lady in the Water
239,Chibichasechan,Get Out of your own Movies Shyamalan.,3,6 June 2007,"I still remember storming out of the theater in disappointment because of this movie. I hate all of Shyamalan's movies, and if you read my previous comment on the Village you would know what I am talking about, so I am not going to get too much into that topic.Off of the village, and into The bedtime story Lady in the Water. I really don't like it at all. I thought it was very pointless, and the actors were very bad. Especially the lady who was playing the ""Lady in the Water."" I thought the story was very weird, and twisted, and I wouldn't consider it a children's bedtime story for my kids, if I had any.Not scary, though it did make me jump at parts. No parts of the movie really caught my attention, and I wasn't at the edge of my seat like most horror movies. So I wouldn't consider this to be a horror film, more like a thriller, but a bad thriller at that.Now, Shyamalan needs to get out of his own movies. I find it very low for a director to be in his own movie just to get more money. He isn't even a good actor, and they probably had no one else to be in this weird movie, so why not put our own director in it, to make it even more crappier? Or try to get a better and more experienced actor on the role? And actually act instead of standing there talking like an idiot.3/10.... I have nothing else to say.",Lady in the Water
240,movie_freak_dubai,Not the best shyamalan flick,6,10 September 2006,"I'll be frank... i did not enjoy this as much as his other movies. But let's be honest, it is not a bad movie at all as the audience still wants to know what happens in the end.The cast was pretty good i thought except Bryce Howard did not seem to have that ethereal quality that was required for the 'Narf'... maybe someone like Uma Thurman would have been nice. Paul Giamatti was good as always. Shyamalan himself was miscast i thought. Possible Spoiler : The problem with this movie was that it did not draw you in like Unbreakable, signs and 6th Sense.... the main characters in those movies did not believe what was happening to them and took their own sweet time to admit the truth and took the audience along with them. In this movie Giamatti was quick to believe and so were the rest of the building tenants in forming 'the Guild' and being the Interpreter. As for twists, there were more than enough twists..... but i felt that they were a bit too well telegraphed and most moviegoers would figure it out anyway.No matter what you say about Shyamalan... people will still go to see his movies.. even if it is just to see him fail.",Lady in the Water
241,Evil_Magus,"A Good, But Very Disappointing, Bedtime Story From M. Knight Shyamalan.",6,30 July 2006,"M. Knight Shyamalan is both an interesting writer and director to talk about. To bring up either his name or movies is to open up a cinematic can of worms. People either seem to take him or leave him, love him or hate him, revere him or loath him. Just like with people's opinions on George W. Bush, there just seems to be no middle-ground between the extremes of opinion which have governed his career.However, this is exactly the kind of ground that I take with Lady in the Water. It's not a great film, by any means; and certainly not his best. It's no Unbreakable, Sixth Sense or even Signs; yet it's still better than most other movies that have been made.It's important to note before you watch this movie that the trailers and commercials can be highly misleading. The first one was the most accurate, although it painted it as a Sixth-Sense-esquire mystery, which it is not. The more action-packed second trailer shows it as a surreal horror, which it is anything but. The mystery is explained strait away, and the tame moments of horror are few and far between. This movie can most accurately be described as a comedic dark fantasy, a perfect bedtime story for an adult mind.This movie's direction seems to be constantly at war with itself. There are moments of genius, of highly stylized and unique cinematography. But they come across as only that, as moments amid average direction. The majority of this film is shot rather bland and rather ""safe"", contrasting tremendously with the incredible moments of absolutely brilliant directing. So, while it contains some of his greatest moments of direction, it's still lethargic and average by the end of the film.The acting is excellent. Paul Giamatti was made for this role (or, rather, the role was made for him, Shyamalan claims). He is absolutely convincing as the apartment superintendent who comes across a lady in the water. He carries himself in a very sedate way, in compliance with his character, and his stuttering was never brought into question. He's an excellent actor, and played a part that fit him perfectly. Shyamalan himself gives a surprising performance as this movie's primary supporting actor.The opening sequence of this movie was pointless. It was very unlike Shyamalan to give away all of the mystery before the title even appeared on the screen, and it worked to his detriment here. Nothing was shown that we didn't find out on our own (and in a better fashion) during the course of the movie. The back-story paired up with the stick-figure animation was very poorly done, and even bordered upon laughable at times. It seemed to me that perhaps Shyamalan watched Beauty and the Beast a few too many times before sitting down to write the story. It worked in the 1991 film, but not in this one.Humor is not a factor for which Shyamalan's films are known, but which is one of Lady in the Water's greatest strengths. Hardly a scene passes without one humorous moment or another, and all keeping with the tone of the movie. The best part was Bob Balaban's character of Mr. Farber (the movie critic) who (in the true fashion of Gulliver) unknowingly satirized not only this film, but the entire film industry. He type-casts the characters of the film (incorrectly, at that) as well as had a running commentary just before he was killed which mocked horror films. I'm fairly certain that, had this movie not blatantly made fun of movie critics, it would have gotten better reviews. I've already read several that pretty well say as much.The plot itself suffers from one major flaw. That is, it back-tracks terribly. We're told that everybody has a purpose, and are given what those purposes specifically are. A plot develops around these purposes and for maybe a half hour or more builds off of this. However, we're then told that they're not what they were supposed to be, and then move on to show us who're really meant to fill what roles. It comes down to a waste of the audience's time that could have been much improved by condensing the plot and developing it, instead of spending time reinventing it when we're told that it doesn't work.The CGI in the film is good, although not great or prominent enough to be of any particular note. We see much too little of the Scrunts for their presence to be of integral importance. They pretty much just come along to delay Story's (the nymph's) return home. They seemed to demand more of a presence on-screen and a more integral role in the film. Perhaps some of the time spent backtracking and redirecting the plot could have been spent making the rouge scrunt a much larger and more noticeable threat. As it stands, it appeared to be little more than a Boogey-Man hiding in a closet or a Tommknocker knocking on our door.The score to this film was above-average, but far from great. It, like this film, had some truly outstanding moments. But it failed to make any kind of lasting impression on the listener.My overall opinion of this movie, despite what gripes I had with it, is that it's a very good film, although I expected more of this movie from the previews and Shyamalan's own reputation. This is a wonderful film that, though flawed, is better than most other films I've seen. As one viewer said, it operates like a small independent movie on a studio-budget. Fans of Shyamalan's other movies, as well as children and families, should enjoy this movie. Also, fans of Labyrinth and Morrormask should enjoy this as well.",Lady in the Water

245,james.p.taylor,Where will M. Night go from here?,6,14 August 2006,"Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) is an apartment building superintendent. He knows all the residents of The Cove and goes about his job with pride and skill. One night he discovers a girl swimming in the complex pool and she turns out to be something truly wonderful for everyone in the building.Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) is from another world, one that had deep connections with the human world until mankind began to drift away and eventually lost it's connection. Now she is trying to fulfill her destiny and has to find a writer somewhere in the complex who is on the verge of writing something truly world changing.M. Night Shyamalan is a true original. Love or hate his work he always comes up with something original in his film scripts. What differentiates this work from his other films is the relatively meekness of the contents if you don't look deeper in to the work.About fifteen minutes into the film I was honestly preparing to walk out. The early pace is dreadful. M. Night's pacing in films has always been awful at times, but here it was at it's worst. I then decided to stick it out having forked out for a ticket.What you get if you stick with it is a real emotional journey. Dark and complex with a few of the trade mark turns this doesn't have the outright twists that, say, The Village or Sixth Sense had, but it works on the emotions beautifully.One thing that I didn't like was M. Night casting himself as the writer who was going to change the world. Everything is a matter of opinion, and as good as I think he is this is stretching things a bit far. He can act though.Howard shines as Story. She is so ethereal and other-worldly that her casting is perfect. Giamatti is good, but he's done better things in the last year, films he'll always be remembered for. The rest of the cast are generally freaks and odd-balls, most of them actually forgettable despite this.If you're the right person watching this film at the right time in your life Lady in the Water will sweep you away with it's beautiful message and original thinking. Unfortunately I picked a moment that wasn't right. It's an okay film, but some of it is so sloppy and the pacing so slow it'll drive you to distraction.

This isn't his best work at all, but it will get better...right? Wrong. More wrong than you could ever imagine. Lady In The Water markets itself as a soft-core horror flick. But it is truly one of the dumbest and most boring movies I've seen in my entire life. The plot is about a nymph-like woman named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, a good actress in another of Shyamalan's screw-ups) who is a ""narf"" (a character from a bedtime story) and she is trying to find her way back home. Not the stupidest plot line so far, but that's all I knew about it when I went to see it, but if I had only read the reviews for this one. If you want to know how dumb this movie is, in it, there is a monster called a scrunt. Need I say more?Anyway, this ""scrunt"" character is trying to attack Story and a schlub named Cleveland Heep (an annoying Paul Giamatti) and he goes around an apartment complex called The Cove to try to find out more about what might happen. This is director M Night Shyamalan's most lousy and disappointing project to date (because I really wanted to like it as well). You won't find anything like Lady In The Water this summer. And that's a hell of a great thing. It is like Shyamalan's ego trip disguised as a supernatural fairy tale. He puts himself in the front of the movie, because his character knows a lot more than he should. He almost has more screen time than Dallas-Howard herself! The nicest thing you could say about LITW is that it is far-fetched. It is ridiculous and painful-to-watch cinematic mess. Avoid Lady In The Water at all costs.",Lady in the Water

Night Shyamalan could come up with some better stuff, but he takes the movie too seriously and forces us to take it seriously, and at times its just plain stupid, and just ruins the whole movie, it would have been good as like a children's fairy tale or something for little kids, its also the first movie I've been disappointed with that M.

To be honest i don't know why people have such strong feeling against this film, this film is just like M Nights earlier ones, and one of the best! I agree, it is a little crowded with too many characters, but it aided the story perfectly. Another perfect thing was the balance of comedy and suspense in this film. M Night is a master.One of the few things i didn't like though was M Nights gigantic acting role in this film. It was just too much, and i couldn't help thinking it was him, and not the character.Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard were, plainly, perfect, but despite the supporting cast being fantastic also, it made Paul and Bryce look worse than they actually were.There were, some unnecessary touches, but none that were too affecting on the overall look of this movie. I do have to say though, parents, beware, because even though there is no swearing in this, it should certainly be a 12a and not a PG. This is too complicated and scary for young children.See this!

251,JimmyZappa,Shyamalan's Formula doesn't seem to wear out,5,22 July 2006,"I liked the movie, but I can understand that anyone who hated all his other movies (including or disincluding the Sixth Sense) will not turn their heads for this one (especially my roommate).But if you're one of those people who actually enjoy Shyamalan's subtle, mainstream ""experimental"" style, you won't be disappointed. I can guarantee you on that one.The big difference between this movie and his other ones is the fact that his characters don't stare in to space and speak in monotone (well, minus one anyway). This time, the characters express a lot of emotion and personality, which ends up resulting in a lot of lighthearted moments mixed in with Shyamalan's signature ""stare-into-space"" thing. There are also a lot of ""laugh out loud"" moments, which is surprising since you don't expect that kinda thing in any of his movies. But I thought they worked well here, it made the experience more enjoyable.The story is about the same as in all his other movies, which involve the supernatural and fantasy clashing in with our reality. I won't get into anymore detail than that, but you'll see that aside from this new change in character build up and personality, you'll still see the same ""artsy"" camera angles (a few in the beginning can hurt the eyes, like in Signs), subtle horror, and ""surprise"" scares.The only thing I can say that disappointed me is that despite the fact I liked how all the characters got involved (and his ability to make you think ""X"" happens but instead it doesn't), I didn't think all the characters were fully explored. Sometimes I didn't even know what they were doing, the story doesn't exactly flesh out and explain itself very well. More details about the legend and the characters would've made a bigger difference.Also, like I said, if you're one of those people who don't like Shyamalan's camera work and storytelling from his previous movies, then you won't like this one. So it's better if you just avoid it completely, don't waste your time and complain about it later. I warned you.But for the curious and the Shyamalan fan, i'd say its worth it. Like any of his other movies that require you to be absorbed in the atmosphere and get into the moment, its more the same and its still a formula that hasn't completely worn out yet.",Lady in the Water
252,santegeezhe,Some suspension of disbelief required...,7,24 December 2006,"I've read some of the other reviews of this movie and it seems like a lot of folks thought it was wretched. This surprises me to some extent. I mean, it's not an excellent movie by any means, but I found it pretty entertaining in a ""fairy tale"" sort of way, although some suspension of disbelief is required. But doesn't that go for all fairy tales? It's true there are plot holes big enough to drive a truck though in this movie. The most glaring example is the fact that nobody asks any questions about what's going on, they just join right in without hesitation. Personally, if some dude showed up at my door ranting about some sea nymph from another dimension who needed saving, I'd just assume he was insane and politely close the door. Not so in this flick.Having said that however, I still found this to be an entertaining movie in a fantastical, fairy tale sort of way. I think it was clear from the outset that this is what Shaymalan was going for. This movie is in no way supposed to be realistic. Rather, it's a magical, fantastical story, and in a way this gives Shaymalan a liscense to get away with things that he couldn't in a ""normal"" movie. Thus, I thought it worked whereas others apparently didn't.This definitely isn't Shaymalan's best work, but I found it to be an entertaining movie that I was able to lose myself in for a couple of hours. In all honesty there wasn't much point to it, but in terms of escapism, it worked for me. And isn't that what movies are all about?",Lady in the Water

This is also great movie plurality of meanings with a great cast proves again that Shyamalan, the director even though he is one of the directors at the most professional and interesting work in industry.

254,Bigbang,Random nonsense doesn't equal brilliant,2,18 February 2007,"Awful movie. Can't believe it has a 6.1 rating. I began to understand what Mr. Night was trying to say as the movie progressed. Why the ""Lady in the Water"" herself was named ""story"". About the expectations of storytelling and how every story has been told and how one can tell a new story, or something. Why the actors were walking around confused and doing random nonsense. Even though it started to make sense to me, I still didn't care. Somebody needs to reel M. Night in. He's gone insane.Hey Mr. Night, back to Earth fella. Earth to Mr. Night. Helllo? I appreciate him trying to do something different. Great. But that doesn't give you the right to have atrocious acting, including Paul Giamatti, who is ALWAYS good. M. Night even ruined him which I though was impossible. There were an Asian mother and daughter who were awful and annoying. Just because you're trying to do something different doesn't give you free license to write terrible stupid dialogue. Different doesn't mean it's okay to have bad special effects. Boring and slow pacing doesn't equal inventive. Different doesn't mean you can have the characters walking around aimlessly doing and saying random nonsense. Hey I can make a movie like that too, is everyone going to call me brilliant? Well it must have worked because some people actually liked this movie. Great for them. But I think M. Night was just trying to be too clever by 3/4 and I saw right through it. Not fooled. Nice try.",Lady in the Water
255,CompuLOL,This is one of the few instances I'd wish I could give a zero star rating...,1,21 September 2013,"""Worst movie I've recently seen"" also doesn't quite state my disappointing experience with this awful film (except maybe for Cloverfield): This movie is so bad that I couldn't even watch it as a whole the first time. It hurt that much.- It doesn't make any sense; either lit or fig. It fails as a grown up or kid film. It fails as a comedy or drama. But most importantly, it fails to entertain as a family rated fantasy fairytale; which was it self describing selling point. It's unimaginative, unsuspenseful, pretentious, boring and stupid. The acting, of course, is horrible too. It basically involves around trying to save a mysterious woman (by extension of the entire world, really) that magically appears at the swimming pool of an apartment complex building of modern times. By merely returning it to where she belongs to and came to begin with; using solely the power of belief, while fending off nasty creatures that unavoidable will try to wreck the attempt. Of course is not that simple; like just calling the cops; there are rules to follow, or there wouldn't be any story to tell. In this particular case, for some more idiotic and cliché reason, is that you have to conjure up a party of ""special people"" (retards really, besides the movie critic) for the saving act to actually work; except that there is the catch that you don't really know who they are. So you're basically led in a blind wild chase of the people living there, since you pretty much have to guess who is who. Because only universally and nonexclusive descriptive archetypical attributes are given to you. So good luck solving that, sherlocks... Another sure tale sign of failure was the self casting of the director in a mayor role. You're not Woody Allen; genius. Deal with it; most people do.- I mean; I don't know about you but; if I see an IRL nymph on my poolside, my first impulse would be trying to shag her :) But alas, the most appalling thing of it all is that there is a character that sup devises wise and mystical meanings of out; get this; cereal boxes! No wonder people have lost all respect for Night's work (twists notwithstanding) This is what happens when you don't listen to good and constructive advice about how you are in the making of a titanically bad movie; and then just claim ""creative diffs"" to keep doing your silly and awful thing. When I try to please my children; I play with them or buy them gifts. The latter as a lame copeout. If you wanted to do the same; then you should have shot a personal project with an average camcorder. Like the rest of normal people do; instead of trying to forcethroat on us this unspeakable monstrousity! And finally; this movie feels like an obv exercise of self messianically prophetizing Night as the one and only savior of mankind; or at least childlike attributes' cinema. So in the bitter end, the only purpose this lame ""story"" :wink: inspired me to do; besides puking; was write this very review. And I'm surprised it didn't end his career as well. In a way I'm glad because he kept gracing us with even greater quality offerings; like Avatar: The Last Airbender.:/",Lady in the Water
256,loyolite,Too much of fantasy...,1,22 July 2006,"I just came back from the movie, and I can't stop believing that MNS is simply going down in quality of his movies. I am (..was ) a big fan of his movies, but I saw the pattern there. Each new movie was a little worse than the previous one. 6th sense -> Unbreakable -> Signs -> Village, and now this.Someone should tell MNS, that you can't create a fairy tale from scratch. In this movie he went all the way with fantasy. His earlier movies had just some amount of super-natural stuff, but this movie had just some amount of realism.Too many real characters, too many fantasy characters, lack of suspense and thrills. The story is something that you can think of as well, if you wanted to create a bed-time story. Just think random, put some good , put some evil, put some more good to protect the good and put your thoughts together just to give a happy ending, and there you have it -your own ""Lady in the Water"".When I go to tell this story to my friends, I am over within a minute, since there really is no story as well.The most noticeable thing about this movie is that it does not appear to be a MNS movie, because of what we are made to believe by now, that his movies end well/have suspense/awesome twists.I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, but I wonder whether I will be this keen for the next one.",Lady in the Water
257,jabarker81,"Even though this was the start of Shyamalan's downfall, I kind of liked it",6,3 March 2019,"Normally, I'm pretty critical when it comes to certain movies. But, when you have Shyamalan, the creator of The Sixth Sense, recreating a bedtime story he told his kids, and you get Lady in the Water. It may be a mixed bag for some of it, but for the rest of it, it kind of manages to redeem itself at some points. Don't get me wrong. The writing is pretty tacky, some of the camera angles are weird, especially when the camera is in front of the actors, and they look into it, and some of the choices Shyamalan made while writing this were probably him maybe trying too hard to throw in some twists and turns, mostly due to those ""maneuvers"" just crashing and burning. But, there is two aspects I liked the most about this movie I liked, and they're the night settings, and the haunting design of the Scrunt, even though I would've given it a better name. So, again I've run into a mixed bag, but I don't know which side to take. Was it good, or was it bad? It was a bit of both. It's hard to criticise this movie for odd reasons.",Lady in the Water

To feel that everyone is related and we all make a difference, which would lead to something big. And we know we are a part of it. That we have a purpose. I almost forgets how it feels to believe in magic. To feel the magical embrace that calms me whenever my head got screwed very badly. I almost forget how that feels. I also almost forgot how it feels to be IN the movie. How many times did you flipped open the remote and suddenly you are sucked IN to the TV. You are a character in that movie. You exist. You are a part of that movie and you know it. You don't just feel it, but you know it. And not only in the movie, but everything around you. That there is one pin-point direction that you are here to accomplish. That finally you live for something.I guess the reason I feel so related to the movie is because M. Shyamalan uses character so simple. So relating. So...ordinary. Giamatti proves that to be true.And out of the gray, dull world, came Bryce-Dallas Howard. A light shining among them. She is very much untouchable and enlighten the film. This movie moves very deeply as it drags on. This is a kind of movie you will either TOTALLY hate it, or ABSOLUTELY love it.But still, each and everyone should at least try watching this film at least once.

260,nujuv,this was getting a slating over here,7,19 August 2006,"There are some very uncharitable reviews going around for this flick.I hated the Village and Signs irriated me in a similar way to this film (they both try and rationalise weirdness in a by-the-dots manner, but this film does a better job) and some evil swine ruined the ending of SIxth Sense for me. Having said all that, I have a lot of hope for the future career of MNS, as Unbreakable is one of my favourite films of recent years. He seems to be - at the heart of all his most famous films - trying to retell tales so familiar in new ways, which is no bad thing.A lot of the criticism of this film wouldn't be occurring if the main characters were pointy eared or shield bearing elvesis or dwarvis or fantasy-standard-number-6411109862555.1-is. To my mind, this film is trying to break down the way a fantasy story is told and pointing ridicule at the idea of some average schmo/schmaoette going round asking ""are you the Guardian?"" if they were taken out of the standard fantasy context (ie: no pointy ears or Lamal soundtrack - never ending story???).Where this film falls foul is its reliance on the smugness of this concept and forgets to engage the audience with a plausible vision of a brilliant tale - the result is something that falls far short of its clear intentions and is open to poor/snyde reviews (channel 4 TV UK - happy to rend to pieces. Makes some good points though).Hazza for the look or the film Boo Boo for the lazy script Hazza for Giamatti and the last water related shots Boo Boo for anyone who fueds over the style of creativity at the expense of allowing public debate - lets face it, we don't know what we'll pay for until we decide whether to pay for it - ie cinema going public and the Walt feud thing (channel 4 UK articles)",Lady in the Water
261,stephen-dhondt,enchanting little fable,7,24 September 2006,"The fabulous ""The Sixth Sense"" introduced us to the phenomenon that is M Night Shyamalan. His slow but certain storytelling and his original camera viewpoints were loved by both audiences and critics. But his rising star soon took a hit when it turned out he overused his already trademark 'surprise ending'.Now, he's back, with nothing more than a bedtime story. No big plot-twists, no kids seeing dead people, no blind girls spectacularly avoiding almost every tree in the woods ... but that doesn't mean he isn't relying on our suspension of disbelief.""Lady in the Water"" is one of those films you either love or hate, there's no in-between. If you can't open your mind to a movie that's nothing more than a modern (and pretty funny) fairytale, then you're hopelessly lost from the beginning. However, if you can make yourself believe in mysterious creatures and magical beings again, then you'll probably enjoy this little 'mainstream' movie.The Music (as in Signs) is once again a perfect contribution to the images. The casting (even though Shyamalan definitely has revealed his God complex) is spot on. And the well built up mood and cinematography (a grey apartment block never looked so attractive) are sublime.so in conclusion: open your mind, and you'll have the opportunity to experience an enchanting little fable. If you choose to keep it closed, then don't even start watching this.",Lady in the Water
262,mrsknoll,Outstanding...a nice change from M. Night,10,31 December 2006,"When I first read the press about this film, I wasn't deterred from seeing it in the least. Critics have slammed ""Lady in the Water"" and M. Night Shamylan up and down, backwards and forwards from the beginning for being such a stark contrast to his earlier works. While it is not as thrilling or mysterious as the ""Sixth Sense,"" this film is in some ways better than Night's traditional suspenseful-horror-mysteries.The story itself is a fantasy, conceived from a bedtime story he told his children. The film draws you into a world of what could be and makes the viewer feel like a child again - falling into the fantasy of a bedtime story becoming reality. Night has this way of making you feel involved in his films - as though you are a secondary character - a part of the movie. He does this through beautifully shot frames and creative cinematography. Night is one of the few directors that truly understands how to use ""Point of View"" and entice the audience with it.""Lady in the Water"" is imaginative and intriguing with characters that are so true to life - people you could have, and probably have, met in your own life. From the opening credits to the final scene, I was enthralled in this world of fantasy and reality, wondering which was which, dreaming of this other realm, wondering if it could really exist. The casting is superb. The writing is beautiful. The sets are a perfect fit. This movie was truly outstanding. It left me desperately wanting to see what happens ""after"" the final credits - what happened to the ""writer"" and the ""healer"" (when you watch it, you will understand). I longed for an epilogue, for these characters got under my skin just enough that I HAD to know what became of them after the film's conclusion. Silly, I know.I would highly recommend this film. I will, however, give a warning to those expecting ""Signs"" or ""The Village"": you will be disappointed. Night did something with this film that caused him to sever ties with other film studios, brought the wrath and scorn of hundreds of film critics and even prior to its release, made him a ""scary movie"" has-been in the eyes of thousands of fans. It is NOT a scary movie and you cannot treat it as one, or you will eject it from your DVD player sorely disappointed.""Lady in the Water"" is a must-see full of adventure, fantasy and promise.

Paul Giamatti is marvelous as Cleveland Heep, an injured soul who finds new purpose when he discovers the Lady in the Water, and the supporting cast delivers as well.M. Night Shyamalan makes it easy for us to suspend disbelief, put aside our cynicism, and believe -- for a while, at least -- that human beings really are capable of redemption. Since the ""monster"" is not especially scary, most of the characters are funny, and the message is so positive, I think this film would be appropriate for children as young as eight or nine, despite the PG-13 rating.Adults will find Shyamalan's take on film critics especially amusing.",Lady in the Water
264,pswitzertatum,Not bad at all,7,14 September 2006,"Surprisingly, this film was much better than I had expected from most if not all the reviews I had read. It didn't bother me that the writer, director, producer is in the film. He did an OK - not great, but adequate - job of acting; it was not embarrassing at all as I had worried it would be from what the reviews said. The story is quite absorbing and full of totally interesting and quirky characters. The personalities and their interactions are great fun to watch. The plot worked for me as a ""fable"" or ""fairy tale"" with oddball twists and is worth the time and effort to follow. I could see this as an elaborate, continuing story that the director as a youngster might have thought up and kept adding to to entertain himself, and wanted to follow up on as a movie script. Paul Giamatti is truly wonderful as the paunchy and hangdog, forlorn and lonely, but determined ""hero."" The downside for me is as usual the unbelievably poor quality of the creatures or monsters in this director's films. They so often seem really stupid-looking and tacky, but then, perhaps they are the products of a childlike (childish?) mind that is working through some complicated inner psychological dramas? Somehow they did seem to work for this far-fetched but fetching story.",Lady in the Water

Can't watch the usual ""M"" or ""R"" rated shows, even Friends makes me nervous because, you know, old people. So I stumble on this and don't even think twice, smashing the play button. I actually ended up loving this. The acting was incredible, the story telling was amazing, then throw in a little mystery, and you've got a special little performer here. If you're now, or were previously (like me in the mid 2000's) expecting a suspenseful horror flic, or a bone chilling thriller, you'll be disappointed. This is none of those things we've come to expect from blockbusters, or if a Liam Neeson film were to meet Insidious.

268,zebraspots,A bedtime story for everyone,8,3 September 2006,"""Lady in the Water"" begins in a ""Watership Down"" way. A tale of myths is told with animation to set of events and get the viewer thinking before the movie has launched into its real story. The small animations used immediately catch your attention and imagination.Cleavland Heep (Paul Giamatti, ""The Illusionist"") works as the caretaker of a modern, yet small, apartment building. Every tenant knows one another and, for the most part, they get along. Mr. Heep isn't exactly satisfied with his life, but who is? On a late night excursion around the pool, in an attempt to figure out who has been taking midnight swims, Mr. Heep slips and falls into the pool. Story (Bryce Dallas Howard, ""Manderlay"")rescues him. Who is Story? Who is this mysterious girl who won't say anything of her origins, except ""narf""? According to an old bedtime story, a narf is a water nymph which is sent to us for a special purpose. Mr. Heep soon realizes Story's words are true and that there is more to everything than what one first sees. ""Lady"" produces thought, and, more importantly, laughs. Not only is it a meaningful film, it is a funny film. Many of you might expect a movie based on a children's story to be silly and not worth your money. Others would think an M. Night Shyamalan movie to be scary (or, considering his last two films, bad). ""Lady in the Water"" is neither. Its weak spot is the ""creatures"". They are reminiscent of the forest monsters in ""The Village"", except these are much more clearly CG. But, one should not focus solely on that.In this movie, not only does Shyamalan improve his story-telling techniques, but he also gets in some serious acting. He is a main character. One can forget he write, produced, and directed the movie, he's now really part of it all. Giamanti's performance was brilliant, no complaint's, and he starred alongside the excellent Bryce Dallas Howard. Howard's last Shyamalan movie was ""The Village"" playing Ivy Walker, the blind daughter of one of the secret keepers. In ""Lady"" she emanates a peaceful innocence perfect for her character.",Lady in the Water

The acting was very impressive, the story was one of the most original I've ever seen in a movie (recently, at least), the music was really nice, it kept me on the edge of my seat (and threw me off of it at one point), and it even had some good laughs.I must admit that this movie is SO original that it can seem ridiculous at times, but hey, with this movie around, no one can complain about their being no originality in Hollywood anymore. Ever since ""The Sixth Sense"", people have set expectations for Shyamalan that are too high. No two of his movies are exactly the same, and yet people expect another ""Sixth Sense""...and when he didn't deliver what they wanted, they trashed him for it.This movie was really good and underrated...it deserves AT LEAST a 7.0 on the IMDb rating.",Lady in the Water

Conveniently, the movie relies on a character who can provide extraordinary detail about this legend, just when it is needed most.

272,guillermotorofan,"As expected from Shyamalan, this film is a work of beauty.",10,21 July 2006,"In 2004 M. Night received a beating from critics and viewers alike. And it would seem that this film will receive the same treatment. This sudden disliking of his films is beginning to make me wonder. To be honest I simply cannot and will never understand this hatred, as I do not feel that way. Yet, I think that people are losing sight of the true meaning of his films. The beauty beneath his films are what are supposed to be noticed. He takes ridiculous plots, a plot almost always frightening and gut wrenching, and he makes you believe. He makes you cry with it. He brings a human element to fantasy. He time and time again does what no other filmmaker I think can quite harness. How his films are now continuously getting grossly mis-interpreted and understood, damages my faith in the current audience. As a man who loves film with virtually all of his heart, it is this kind of moments that make me sad, these things that make me cry. The film starts with a man who is the manager of an apartment complex called The Cove. It is a dozen story building which surrounds a pool. He is a lonely man, who has suffered probably the most terrible loss I can currently imagine, and he feels as if he has no purpose. Until he finds a mysterious lady in the pool, whom draws many people to her whom are all connected with the future, and they must discover what part they play. Acting: 10/10Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard(in a skimpy outfit, I just HAVE to add). Need I say more?Writing: 8/10I hate to give it 8, but I cannot deny the flaws in plot. The plot has its speed bumps, but it builds tremendously well towards the end and as always, Night keeps you interested and wondering what could possibly happen next. Though it contains no twist ending (see: Sixth Sense, The Village, and Unbreakable), it has many mini twists that all come together unexpectedly in the end (see Night's own Signs). Flawed, but incredibly fun, frightening, moving, twisty,turny, and original. The original part is refreshing, as the critic in the film says ""I am convinced, there is no more originality anymore"". Directing: As Roger Ebert said (and judging by his recent reviews of Shyamalan's films, regrets saying), M. Night is undoubtedly a born filmmaker. He brings such amazing humanity to a tale about bloody sea nymphs! Could you do that? I don't think so, and I definitely could not tell a story in such a way. Cinematography/Special Effects: 9/10Very few effects are there, but what is is very good. The camera work is good, often great, but rarely inspiring much of a gasp or wow from me. Score: I have made an oath that if James Newton Howard does not get at least an Oscar nomination, that I will once and for all, stop watching the Oscars. I am often disgusted with the Oscars as it is very often nothing but a popularity contest. I have little hope for that ceremony, and if James is stiffed, than I will finally just give up. This score is THAT good.On the whole, Shyamalan is in fact, a born filmmaker. Mr. Shyamalna, I bow to you.Final Grade: A",Lady in the Water
273,Gypsybelle,Do you have Imagination? If so you will love this film!,8,22 July 2006,"With Lady in the Water, Shyamalan renders a beautiful fantasy tale. Some of the critics didn't get it, because they've long ago gone brain dead and require a fast pace action filled tale that doesn't require any real mental power to understand. I wasn't sure what to expect from this one, after the marketing for The Village, but I was not disappointed one bit. While it is slow paced, I was never bored and stayed transfixed to the screen. The only negative thing I could say is that there are a few holes in the storyline. It was rather rushed and lacked some real character development. Not one of the residents really doubts Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) when he tells them he has a sea-nymph called a 'narf' and needs everyone's help because she is in danger. Maybe it was a prerequisite for living in the complex not to be a skeptic? Story, as wonderfully portrayed by Bryce Dallas Howard, brings up Cleveland's tragic past - but it is just dropped out there without warning. Otherwise, I loved the film. Mr. Shyamalan is definitely original in his material. If you like a good fantasy story as an escape from the 6 o'clock news, give Lady in the Water a try.",Lady in the Water

While it does have supernatural elements, its much more of, well, I guess a fairy tale. It's got some great scares but overall it will be enjoyed more if you know ahead of time your not going to be sitting on the edge of your seat.The theme of ""finding your purpose"" definitely is poignant in this day and age, I love all the self reflexive humor as far as story structure goes too.SFX were decent, not awe inspiring but good for what was required.

I loved some of them, and hated others, but all of them felt like the same type of movie. The Lady in the Water is much different. With Shyamalan taking a more personal story to the big screen, he hit all the right notes.First off, the cast is superb. The worst acting job came from M. Night himself, but I can forgive him. It's unusual for him to cast himself in such an important role, but I understand why he did it. This film gave me newfound respect for Paul Giamatti. He kept me glued to the screen the way that only great actors can. Bryce Dallas Howard was much better in The Village, but maybe her white eyelashes just freaked me out in this one. She was distractingly wet for the entire film, and she had so few lines I can barely call her the star of this movie. The supporting cast is made up of mostly un-knowns with a few recognizable faces thrown in. Watch out for the not-so-sly Roger Ebert references.The other 4 well-known Shyamalan movies have his traditional ""twist ending"". This one is more of a winding road that keeps you guessing the entire time. People say that about a lot of movies, but this one really will stump most people. The ending is done well, but it's not a surprise in itself.Overall, The Lady in the Water was a surprisingly entertaining ride. It won't suit mass audiences, because it takes it's time with the storytelling. But if you're looking for a good time-out from reality, I'd recommend this flick.",Lady in the Water

From there he is drawn into a world of myths and fables where the young girl's life is in danger and he must assemble the unlikeliest crew of heroes to help her return to her world.The characters in the film are for the most part eccentric and distinct, all of them 'good' people, even the irascible newcomer, although unaware of their own talents.

I can't believe why they think this movie is so bad. I thought it was great. It had suspense, very good dialogs, compelling characters, and some very effective scares.The movie is about a stuttering man named Cleveland Heep who work as a apartment superintendent. One night Cleveland finds a ""Lady in the water"" swimming. He soon finds out that the woman is a narf that has come from the Blue world and has a message to mankind. Now it's Clevelands mission to help her. The movie features some very good performances of two very good actors, Paul Giamatti (as Cleveland Heep) and Bryce Howard Dallas (as the narf, Story). Bryce character is very similar as her character in the Shyamalan movie ""The village"" in many ways. Shyamalan is still young, but has already been established as one of the best directors and screenwriters living today. His way of storytelling is very different from other screenwriters and directors. The movie features many cool and compelling characters, like the Chinese student, the weird writer, etc. They're all very funny, and makes the movie very entertaining. This movie features more comedy then in Nights previous movies. But it still has all the suspense, scares and the great direction from his other movies.One of the best thinks about the movie i think, is the music. James Newton Howard delivers again a superb score, and proves that he is one of the greatest composers ever.The visual effects in this movie is much better than in M. Night Shyamalans ""Signs"". In the movie Signs the visual effects was distracting from the story, but in this movie, it was very good.I think this movie was incredible entertaining. Everyone shud see it.",Lady in the Water
278,marioonline,Wrong extrapolation,7,4 October 2006,"The Sixth Sense was really really good (and scary); Unbreakable was kind of boring (and definitely not scary); Signs was quite good (and really scary at some moments); The Village wasn't good nor scary. So, trying to extrapolate from the available data, I was expecting Lady In The Water to be both good and scary. Well... it is not at all bad, and it scares you from time to time, but the scare in this movie is based on really cheap tricks and the goodness of the movie surprisingly comes from something that, in my humble opinion, has never been a primary factor in M Night's movies: the acting. I won't be discussing the relations between directors and actors, nor whether it is the director's task to take the best out of the cast... I'm not an actor, nor a director, just a movie-goer. But let me just say that even though M Night has always being casting great actors and actresses, they have never shone in his movies (the biggest exception being Haley Joel Osment, of course). Lady In The Water is then really different, and so no good extrapolation can come out of comparing it to the other M Night movies. The plot is based on a bedtime story, so you can imagine you won't be getting a lot of thrill out of it. Besides, the trademark plot twists are not effective at all in this movie, in that they hardly make any difference from the viewer's point of view. Kind of: ""Oh, so _________ is the __________ and __________ is the ___________"" big deal...let's move on! So, back to the acting. A nice surprise came from Bryce Dallas Howard, who has improved her acting skills a lot since The Village, even though I suspect her performance in this movie has been enhanced by her magnetic eyes and a very skillful make up that makes her look even eerier than usual. Paul Giamatti has once again proved to be a very, very, very talented actor. Even though the story behind his character is another non-effective trick in the plot, during the movie he gives an extremely intense (sort of) monologue that is without any doubt the highest peak of the entire work. Bravo! All in all, Lady In The Water is an enjoyable fantasy movie, with good direction, very good acting, a so-and-so plot, but hey...if you keep in mind that it is a fantasy movie (hence, you lower your expectations a little bit), you're up for a very nice couple of hours.",Lady in the Water
279,beam_er,Truly Disappointed ...,4,24 December 2006,"It just seemed to me that M. Night Shyamalan, who wrote this movie, should have had someone proofread the script before turning this into a movie. There are parts of the story which just do not make any sense. I know he meant well when writing this, but the story is so lacking in so many places. I really wanted this film to work. I waited in anticipation for the DVD release, having missed my chance to see this in the theater. I fell for what hype there was in the trailers I saw. It seemed like it was going to be a very good experience. Unfortuneatly, the movie just fell flat for me. I can not recommend this movie at all.",Lady in the Water
280,Bayjohn,"Disappointing, despite the cast...",2,25 December 2006,"Considering the talent involved in this project, you would have expected a much better storyline. I know that M. Night Shaymalan's work is unique compared to most modern writers, but this film reaches far out there and is hard for even the most imaginative adult to enjoy. Stories and films about supernatural topics are not for every taste, and therefore I think Mr Shaymalan's writing should not stray too far from reality if he wants to keep viewers (and funding for his films). Bryce Howard's role was an insult, mostly because all she ever does is whisper her lines and parade around nearly naked. I think that fans of Mr Shaymalan will enjoy one sitting of this film, but probably no more than that. Good try, but go back to the drawing (writing) board and try again on the next project.",Lady in the Water

282,Dave_Violence,"Immature, Surprisingly Bad",1,3 February 2007,"I purposely gave the film a ""1"" to try and bring down the overall score (had it fewer defenders, I'd give it a ""3""). It should not be liked by anyone.Story: Turns out an ancient Korean fairy tale/bed time story is true and manifests itself in the common recreation area of a suburban US condominium/co-op/apartment house/ hotel'whatever, where there's a small swimming pool. (Lafcadio Hern is spinning in his grave because he wasted his time moving to Japan when he could've studied Oriental ghost stories and such right here in the US of A).Of course, since the swimming pool is in the US, the ""lady,"" some sort of Queen Nymph called a ""Narf"" is a pale, anorexic Anglo-German American rather than an exotic, regal Asian. She's being chased by nasty beasts called ""scrunts"", all of whom are somehow governed by giant monkeys called ""tartutics."" Yeah, it's just a movie, but I gotta ask how come these beings don't have Korean-sounding names of things like ""wolf made of grass"" and such? ""Scrunt"" sounds too much like something an American school kid would call a classmate. ""Narf"" sounds like a soft ball one can throw indoors.OK, the Scrunts are compelled to kill the Narf because it's what they do. Apparently there are rules about killing narfs, though. BUT, there's a scrunt out there that's breaking the rules!Wow! There's a big wolf made of grass that understands rules! You'd think one could communicate with a being that is able to make a decision... Or you'd be able to kill it...Acting-wise, direction-wise, technically, the film is competent. The actors are real, even M. Night is believable playing himself. The story, though, comes off as though it was written by a ten-year old, NOT as though it was written by an adult for a ten-year old. There are plot holes that distract too much (how can an out-of-shape handyman hold his breath for more than five minutes? - while engaging in strenuous, underwater activity? And seeing so clearly at night? Etc.). The characters come off as though they are trying too hard to make the audience believe that they're ready to believe what's going on - and how eager they are to get us to agree that, gosh, this really is a Narf and not some paranoid schizophrenic asylum escapee... M. Night: OK, so you've read Arthur Machen's stories and similar tales of dreamland by others. Since you confess through Bob Balaban's character that there's no originality anymore (so?), why don't you make a movie about gnolls or dholes or something that would give you the opportunity for excellence in telling someone else's story? The writers of supernatural stories circa 1900-1940 are far superior to anything new, so use your directing talents to give us a film of ""the Hounds of Tindalos""? You can also make a ""kids"" movie based on any number of excellent fairy tales from long ago, not some neo-modern junk like ""the Lady in the Water.""It really cost more than $10 million to make this? No way! Rental cost to me: about $1. Not worth it.",Lady in the Water
283,RockBiter,Adult Bed-Time Story,7,1 August 2006,"This movie is really an adult bed-time story and so you, as an adult, have to ask yourself, 'Am I willing to suspend my disbelief for 2 hours?' If the answer is, 'Ah....no' you will be shaking your head after this one is over and cursing yourself for having seen it. HOWEVER, if the answer is 'Sure, I'll give it a try' you MAY get something out of it you weren't even expecting. For a guy like Night Shyamalan and his imagination you need to approach his work with that openness. I think, by now, most of his fans do. SO, here it is: a narf named Story(Bryce Dallas Howard) comes to visit an apartment building in Philadelphia, meets the Super, Cleveland Heep (Giamatti), needs to get back to her own world, and is pursued by a terrifying creature called a Skrunt. In the process she utterly changes the lives of each of the motley collection of tenants including among others, Shyamalan himself, of course, and Bob Balaban as Mr. Farber.That's the plot and the real theme of it is how the tenants can come together and work together, putting aside all their own differences in order to help Story elude this sinister creature and get back to her world. THAT, as an adult, is what you need to get out of this film. The ruined life of Heep is itself renewed as he finds himself to be 'The Healer' who can bring Story back after suffering from the poisonous gashes of the Skrunt. Each of the other tenants finds a kernel of hope from their experiences with Story, as well.Altogether an okay experience but it stretches the viability factor verrrry far.

Movies are, at their best, visual stories wherein dialogue and logic are secondary players to what is being expressed...by what is SHOWN. Shyamalan may be the most pompous big-name director in Hollywood history. He has (or at least pretends to have) an insanely bloated sense of artistic worth (see his character in this movie) and is a lousy actor; he certainly needs to hire a writer to better flesh out his films' thin thin thin premises. But, to me there's no getting around the fact that he brings home the goods when it comes to creating stunning and affecting visuals and coaxing powerfully emotional performances from his actors. You can complain all day (or until you are self-satisfied) about ludicrous plots, stilted dialogue, narcissism, etc. etc. The fact remains that M. Night can scare pants off with the best of 'em. His technique and performers pull the meat over even the barest-boned plots, and his films feel like a full meal built out of a table scraps.

I have seen several of M. Night Shyamalan's movies and i have to say i am NOT impressed they are always anti-climatic. And very disappointing. But hey we have nothing to say about it. It was so slow and boring that we left before the end. I wouldn't sit through it again, I would recommend it to anyone. And i sure wouldn't pay to rent it either.

286,wjeffer,"Not as bad as ""Signs"" and ""The Village"", BUT . . .",4,29 July 2006,". . . it's just too overworked and convoluted for its own good. For starters, the exposition is weak. While the rest of the film clears things up a bit, one is left with a few questions. I'm not asking for simple stories told simplistically, just stories with cohesive structures, solid expositions, and satisfactorily executed resolutions.As with ""Signs"" and ""The Village"", It just seems Shyamalan was more interested in making a point than providing a good and well-structured story, which (in the end) would have made his point all the more poignant. As with his prior films, including ""The Sixth Sense"", he makes good use of suspense and provides a couple of good scary moments. However, his techniques for suspense are now too easily recognizable and are less effective than they were, especially in ""The Sixth Sense"". He is running the risk of becoming predictable.Finally, will someone please tell him to stop featuring himself in his films. Were he a talented actor, that'd be one thing. This is another technique of his that's becoming predictable. Given the size of his role in this film, it borders on laughable. Had his films since ""The Sixth Sense"" been better, one might forgive his outsized ego. He needs to keep it in check and focus more on providing better entertainment.

Nights second best film, his best being The Village. Acting was superb Bryce Dallas Howard did an amazing job in both the village and this, she portrays a pale fragile beautiful person in both films. I think this movie was bullied by the movie critics, they said it was horrible. It wasn't it was brilliant. The critics have no imagination this was far-fetched for sure, but who said that was a problem. The critics have absolutely no imagination at all. I hear people saying its stupid that people like this piece of junk. I heard one man saying he laughed every time he heard the word narf...now lets just think for a moment. I heard the same people giving The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy a 10/10 but I'm my opinion thats just as far-fetched if not more farfecthed as the lady in the water. Night continues to give us brilliant movies, in fact he is probably the greatest Director/Writer of the 21st century. This movie was amazingly crafted, I prefer this to The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy and thats saying something. The creature looked amazing and very very scary. So overall i give this movie a solid 10/10. I wish that the critics would shut there stupid ass hole mouths and stop bashing it. M. night.Shyamalan never fails to deliver. I leave you by saying go see this with your kids and enjoy it for what it is a fairytale that is not only for young gild, its for every one.See this if you liked : The Village and Signs.So over i give this film a solid 10/10 or *****.",Lady in the Water
288,MobiusAg,Shyamalan Does it Again!!,9,26 July 2006,I recently screened this movie newly engaged and I have to say what an impression this movie will leave with me for a lifetime!! M. Night Shyamalan proves once again why he is one of my favorite directors of this era. He always comes up with unique material to enthrall the audience time after time. I was moved to tears in a couple of scenes and Paul Giamatti needs true Oscar recognition for his role as the troubled apartment super who finally discovers his life is still worth living. The story is delicately balanced and with all of M. Night's films-leaves you in suspense waiting for something to happen. He never fails to deliver. Watching his films is like eating Cracker Jacks...you are looking for the prize and you don't know when or what you are going to get! I am always enthralled by Shyamalan's mastery of the art of film and once again was not disappointed. Either you get M. Night's films or you don't. Those who don't I truly feel sorry for. If you can't get any joy out of his amazing work then something is truly lacking in your psyche. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next. For now...get your ass down to the movies and catch his latest creation - Lady in the Water is another Shyamalan masterpiece!!,Lady in the Water
289,samhendersonthemovieman,"Not perfect, but it's fascinating and beautifully crafted.",7,29 August 2020,"Let me start by saying that M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite filmmakers, even though The Last Airbender is horrible, but I pretty much like most of his other movies like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, and The Village. I know Lady in the Water isn't one of his best according to most people, but I actually quite enjoyed this one. The acting from both the lead actors were wonderful. Paul Giamatti was really well done. Bryce Dallas Howard, who was also in The Village, was so beautiful and sweet. What surprised me in the movie is that, unlike his other movies, M. Night Shyamalan had a role in it instead of a cameo because he usually had cameos in his movies. The movie had a pretty interesting and unique concept about a bedtime story becoming real. In case nobody knows, The movie is based on a bedtime story Shyamalan told to his children, which did made me curious. The musical score by James Newton Howard was very pretty and well done. Like Shyamalan's other movies, The movie is not too scary, but it's suspenseful. Another thing that surprised me was that it had some funny moments, especially the bug squash scene at the beginning, which was quite hilarious. For me, I don't think it wasn't as bad as a lot of people say it is. Lady in the Water is not The Sixth Sense, but it's not The Last Airbender either. It's not a perfect movie, but it's enjoyable and beautifully crafted.",Lady in the Water
290,Calibanhagseed,Sentimental and naive. Great!,9,25 March 2008,"Today cynicism reigns supreme and imagination is dead.That probably why this movie is so reviled as bad. But. ""Goodness to the vile seems vile"" and although I myself am a cynic, this film holds a special place in my heart. I was moved more by this ""incompetent"" fairytale than all the battle speeches and high-school ethics of the fantasy ""Masterpieces"" that are all the rage and seem to follow me as a bad stink.Granted the movies script jumps from childlike humor to drama and horror. Yes, the philosophical speeches and ideals where blatant and unrealistically incorporated in the film, but that doesn't diminish their message of hope and their human warmth.It's the human warmth that makes this movie so enjoyable. I liked the characters, I did not find them caricatures, despite that some of them had unrealistic quirks. In fact I know a lot of people who bear a resemblance to these fictional people.Perhaps a reason why this movie is dismissed as bad, is because it touches -gently, with the reassurance that we all have a purpose- places in our personalities we consider weak and flawed. I for one felt very uncomfortable when Paul Giamatti's character spoke of God in prayer-like plea for Story (the Lady in the water) to heal, because like most people I find that these concepts, Religion, hope and faith, point out a void most of us feel and fly from condemning them as sentimentality and ""infantility"".I think that every cynic who dislikes this movie finds a familiar note in Mr Leeds' words: ""I wanted to believe, more than most. I needed to know that there's more than all this awfulness around us! I wanna be like a child again."" (Oh yes, in the extra scenes on the DVD, he gets his wish.)This movie will touch you, but only if you let it.

You actually hear what real people think about movies, unlike some other review sites I could mention where the critics get to slam good flicks like this beautifully told little fairy tale that Shamalan wrote for his kids.If you let it, this film works on a number of levels; if you're looking for emotion it has bucket loads with a dash of comedy and a scare or two, all delivered with the unique technical skills that Shamalan has developed over his 7 movies. If you liked the 80's ""Company of Wolves"" you'll love this. However, be prepared to engross yourself in a child-like fantasy and don't take it too seriously, over analyse or apply adult values because you'll run the risk of being disappointed like most of the critics on rotten toms - they clearly don't get it - I'll bet they didn't believe in Santa when they were kids ... shame on them!",Lady in the Water

Many of the elements were there, but they just didn't get to me this time. There were some fantastical-mythical angles too, which I certainly looked for in movies like this one, but they somehow failed to lift me. Ah! One more thing! I saw too much of MNS in this. Is it true what they say, that MNS's movies have become less and less gripping these days?

Instead go and rent Blair Witch Project –even that joke of a movie makes more sense that this film. Or if your do not feel like watching a movie, you can always go walk your dog, have sex, exercise, take a nap, watch through the window of your apartment and count how many cars pass by in a minute and see if more or less cars will pass a minute later I do not really know what else you might do but whatever it is it shall be a lot better than watching Lady in the Water.",Lady in the Water
295,Skycoaster,Leave her in the Water,4,24 July 2006,"Well into the range of mediocrity, M. Night Shyamalan's fifth and least potent attempt at horror barely makes it over the halfway point of decency. ""Startling"" revelations become tiring and predictable in a plot that is unnecessarily dialog driven and dull. It is not that there are no interesting people in the plot; they are unique enough to earn whatever screen time they get, like a body-builder who only works out his right side ""for scientific purposes""; but the whole ordeal seems pointless, and we ask ourselves what good really came from the lady's appearance in the pool?For some reason, the pool of The Cove apartment complex is shaped like an eye, with its pupil shifted to one side, the lowest point of the deep end. Every night Cleveland Heep, the caretaker of the complex, follows the pool's gaze from his isolated cabin until he notices a water nymph, Story, splashing around at night.Their first face-to-face meeting, though underdeveloped, gives Story a shroud of mystery, like she's hiding a secret just beneath her pale pink lips. It is not so great when we hear it though, but it is good enough for a movie that has no other bullets in its chamber.Story, as we learn, comes out of a bedtime story, one that the Cove's Choi family has conveniently memorized. The tale is told in small snippets by Young-Soon Choi and her mother to Cleveland throughout the movie. In all honesty, I would have rather heard it all in one scene and then spent the rest of the movie watching it unfold in suspense. Sadly, Shyamalan leaves suspense for what he believes to be a touching relationship between Cleveland and Story; instead, the two remain distant to the point where he will not even enter a room to talk to her and leaves her vulnerable at a crucial moment.Saving the day is Paul Giamatti as Cleveland and Bryce Dallas Howard as Story. Giamatti lets us feel his frustration at his incredibly realistic stutter and gives us the panic of what little tension there is. The situations, though, are illogical and confusing, and the characters react as though they are taken aback by the sojourns from logic and reason. Howard, for example, jumps between being silent and timid to spouting ""secrets"" over a walky-talky. She does decent jobs with both, but the combination does not fit her character.I hope to see more from Shyamalan because I have seen wonders from him. To get future works on their level, I advise he should stop depending on his limited abilities as an actor (though I enjoyed his cameos in Signs and The Village), put more focus on a single character with less outside influence, and, if he wants better reviews, not include direct insults to film critics. Heightened expectations aside, Lady in the Water, like the right-side obsessed body-builder, seems halfway done and not smart at all.",Lady in the Water

It is so annoying.Why the mom who knows this silly bedtime story but can't speak English so we have to endure the daughter translating it??? So annoying.The movie jumps into the main character (Paul G.) believing this silly fable WAY too quickly, and then wastes A lot of time on trying to convince the audience we should also believe it...Total crap, and I have given up at 45 minutes because a movie is not supposed to keep kicking you out of the movie back to reality as you say to yourself ""What???

At all. Period. Why? There is no story to find. Not even any real trademark ""Shyamalan"" twists. I felt a drift of foul wind in the end of ""Signs"" but I hoped he would stay clear of that and return to real story writing but nooo. Mr. Shyamalan stars in the movie himself, as a saintly martyr no less, which only makes him come across as a bit of prick. There is also a pesky film-critic who through his own cynicism meets a sticky end. That might be all good and well, if it's there to make a better movie, but again he fails to not disappoint me. So maybe the critics where a bit too harsh on his later works and maybe he really has a profound message to tell the world, but phu-lease.

300,yurshta,A Modern Fairy Tale,8,15 February 2007,"This movie is a Fairy Tale, but not necessarily one just for the Kinder, and should be compared with other movies involving the elements of Fantasy like the Harry Potter series or even the Lord of the Rings. However, those two movie series are very involved and complex. This story is relatively simple and stands alone and reminds me some ways, but not in style, with films like the Dark Crystal or The Neverending Story, or Time Bandits. There have been quite a few films, mostly rather blah, about some lonely guy finding an angel in his backyard or some such, so I'll not mention them here, and usually the angel has broken her wing or some such, and is, of course, a very lovely female, and in most cases, the man falls in love with the angel but loses her when after her wing heals she returns to Heaven or some such. So that's all we have here, a simple fantasy, but a Nymph, not an angel. A nice story, and the idea ""borrowed"" I suspect from the ""angel"" movies. Yes, I must confess that I wouldn't mind a lovely and innocent (and naked!) nymph jumping out of my swimming pool (if I had one) too! And that's all fantasy really is...the world as it ought to be, but not as it is. It's a pity, for a Nature lover like myself, that the mythology of ancient Greece is not literally true and Zeus, Juno, Athena, Apollo and the other Olympians reigned forevermore, beautiful and immortal, and the forests and streams were frequented by Satyrs, Fauns, Nymphs, Dryads, and an occasional glimpse of the god Pan as he roams the forest playing his flute. Yes, it's a sad shame...but then that's fantasy. Fantasy is a good thing. In this modern world where the Natural is condemned and the Artificial is elevated to the Divine, and mankind become nothing but ants running around in an ant farm, and Big Brother and Armageddon loom over our horizon, we need some escapism now and then, and the Lady in the Water is just that. It is escapism, it is entertainment, it is high fantasy. It's a pretty story that hints that our lives could be otherwise, which is true, but don't bet on any changes for the better. It is a good movie--not a great movie--but a good one. Well worth watching.",Lady in the Water

He has no idea how human beings work, period. There is a difference between heightened reality and utterly unbelievable BS, and Shyamalan just kept digging farther down his personal rabbit hole until no one knows who he intended this for, unless his kids convinced him this was great storytelling, demonic trolls that they are. And on top of all that he wastes a perfectly good Paul Giamatti and a halfway decent cast, too.The fault is entirely the director's problem. 'Twas his story, his directorial decisions that utterly wrecked the storytelling here.

As the film progresses, Cleveland and the other tenants of the apartment block discover that they have roles to play in Story's...errm....story.Anyhoo...without giving away too many spoilers, the full tale is told (painfully slowly), and becomes so implausible that it snaps the oh-so-important element of suspension of belief, repeatedly! Firstly, there are the stupid names.Secondly, a whole apartment block of fairly diverse characters are ready to completely and unquestioningly drop their rationale and start believing in this far fetched tale, which includes giant eagles, grass rats and invisible evil tree-monkeys. Sure! Okay! It's a film after all, and let's face it, there are films which have crazier plot-lines. The problem is that the mundane and the fantastic does not gel here. (In fact, it never seems to gel in any M.Night Shyamalan film anymore). People are quite happy to just go along with the whole thing without ever questioning their reasoning or their sanity.Thirdly, the acting is just god-awful. I'm pretty sure that an actor doesn't need much motivation to play a part where the role is to just play an apartment tenant, but 90% of the cast even struggle with that! I will give props, however, to the actress who played the oriental student living with her mother, and to the guy who had to train up one side of his body, not because his acting was much cop (it wasn't), but for actually training part of his body for the role.Fourthly, there really were no outstanding moments throughout the whole film. No ""Oh no!""s, or ""YESS!"" moments that had you rooting for the characters. Even the scene where Cleveland descends into the pool was about as thrilling as the opening scene where he is squishing a bug in a flat full of squeamish sisters. Even the ending is all very anti-climatic. It just...ends (which is a small mercy, but after having to put up with the agonizing nonsense that makes up the bulk of the film, the payoff is pretty dismal.Fifthly (are we on five already??!!?), what the hell was the point with the movie critic? Was it supposed to be some sort of inner joke, or a challenge to the audience (at one point) to try to second-guess the outcome, or a metaphor for a separation of what is real and what is just a movie? Whatever Shyamalan had in mind, it didn't work. In fact, it riled me considerably.There are sixthlys, seventhly's, and even a sixteently, but I don't want to start giving away spoilers for anyone who might actually watch this film, and I'm getting a bit fed up with writing so much on this film already, when there are better efforts in a similar vein from any number of other directors.Having said all that, the film wasn't a total loss. There were a few redeeming moments, and I suppose it had a moral (something about how our actions influence others, or how you should never give up on your inner child or some-such), and my best compliment on the whole film is ""At least it wasn't as pitifully bad as the Village"", however, I personally think that the film is a Razzy contender for sure, and Shyamalan should consider taking up poultry farming. He seems to have a knack in producing some big old turkeys!ADDITIONAL EDIT: I initially gave the movie 3 stars. After seeing that Shyamalan chose to give himeslf an important and messianical role in his own film, I was appalled enough to come back and edit this critique. The sheer AUDACITY of the guy! There is nothing wrong with an ego that deserves praise, but this very act of Shyamalan implementing himself in the role of a writer who will change the course of history is mental narcissism to a sickening degree. I hope that Shyamalan NEVER makes another film ever again, no matter how good he thinks he is, he has lost touch with the very people he is supposed to be making these films for, and creating castles in the sky based on nothing more than hype and the success of one single film. He should have listened to Disney. They may be commercial, but they at least know how to make popular & successful films.",Lady in the Water
303,sponge3,Creative & Different But Not Great,6,24 July 2006,"Watching this film was a spur the moment decision. After having a nice meal and a couple of cocktails at one of the many ""all in one"" casinos here in Vegas, we decided to see a movie. I didn't have and preconceived opinions about this movie.The theater was modestly filled for a Friday evening but that didn't really mean anything (to me) one way or the other. I figured the movie was going to be a sort of fairy tale and I was right. There were some laughs, a couple of scary moments and an overall feel good premise to the story. The acting seemed fine but nothing that knocked my flip flops off. The writer/director has a role in the film but I didn't feel that it added anything to the movie, and for me, it seemed kinda forced. Even though this was a fairy tale, there were more than a few scenes that had you going ""huh""? The overall impression that I got from the rest of the audience was similar to mine. I didn't hate sitting through this on the big screen but I would have rather watched it as a DVD rental in my own home theater. I liked the fact that you can't really compare it to anything but that is where the majority of my score comes from. I think I wanted more but I'm not really sure what that would have been.If you aren't expecting great things from this flick, it might be a nice little 110 minutes for you. If you are looking to be blown away, I think you will have to look elsewhere.",Lady in the Water
304,balusmbox,Critics do not like being ridiculed.,9,22 July 2006,"I watched ""lady in the water"" and liked the movie. I was wondering why the critics hated it, Well, the only reason I can think of is that no one likes to be ridiculed. M Night Shyamalan destroys the image of movie critics in his latest offering, and its quite hilarious to watch :D Back to story, we have a lady ""from"" the water who is sent to inspire an event in this world. We also have a middle aged and lonely Cleveland Heep ( played superbly by Paul Giamatti) who discovers her and helps her. What would u do, if u are supposed to save a mythological creature, without any knowledge of their world? What follows is funny at times, predictable yet interesting through out , flawed yet entertaining and as scary as my room mates snore. The kid in all of us will enjoy this movie, and forget abt it in a few days. For adults who like mythology, it is an interesting topic for their lunch conversations. It is quite a task to create mythology in a single movie, and Shyamalan made a decent attempt ... good work Shyamalan.Sorry guys, if u are expecting a scary unpredictable flick like sixth sense, this one is not for u. This one is just as simple as a bedtime story.",Lady in the Water
305,brianwolters,Shyamalan's Folly,2,24 July 2006,"I would first like to say that I am a huge M. Night Shyamalan fan. I didn't see Sixth Sense until it was on DVD and once I did, I was hooked. I've enjoyed each film he has directed since then, including the much maligned ""The Village."" I've been eagerly awaiting Lady in the Water ever since I heard about it. The teaser last winter made me even more curious and I couldn't wait for this movie with a sense of wonder. After finally viewing the movie, I have to say that M.Night has a major mess on his hands.The movie is about an apartment maintenance man named Cleveland Heep whom seems to have a very dull life. He is good at what he does but you can't help but feel that he wants more. One night, when looking for people swimming after hours, he discovers a girl in the pool. Startled and clumsy, he falls into the pool and nearly drowns until he discovers himself back in bed with the girl in his house. She is a Narf from the Blue World who wants to return to her world and avoid the Scrunts (wolf like monster) as she tries to get back via the great eagle. She is to assist Cleveland in assembling a Guild to help her return. Little does Cleveland know that she is also there to help him overcome his grief of losing his family and quitting his job as a doctor. I have a good imagination and I was ready to see how all of this plays out. The child inside me was waiting for a payoff. I am sad to say, I never get it.The movie is a complete, convoluted mess and a huge failure of execution. Let me begin with the characters. The supporting characters in the movie were annoying stereotypes of all kinds of ethnic backgrounds. The young Asian woman, who conveniently told the story of the Narf's by interpreting for her mother was incredibly annoying. It would seem like if the story needed more explanation, she conveniently shows up to tell us more, even being available while at a dance club. Then we have the guy who is only working out one side of his body. He serves no real purpose until the end and when he does, it is completely laughable and not worth the moment of ""awe"" as the movie makes it. Then we have the movie critic, who seems to be there to serve as M.Nights poke at critics at his past movies. M.Night is also playing a supporting role but because he is the director who makes clever appearances, I kept waiting for something magical to happen with his character and we don't get it. He needs to stick with Hitchcock like appearances.The story itself unfolds slowly but when it should be getting more involving and interesting, it simply gets messier. You meet all of the characters in the film and you notice they have certain traits to their personality. Those traits are to be put to use in the Guild that Cleveland is trying to assemble. When it comes time to put it all together, you are waiting for something meaningful to happen and it just doesn't come together. Take the pool party scene. Has there been any scene in the past several years in movies as confusing and perplexing as this? They were there to protect the Lady yet stupid things happen. A girl drops her mirror who is to be watching for the Scrunt. The movie critic shows up and is given horrible dialogue. A band is to be playing inside but doesn't start on time. As a result of the confusion, the Lady is taken by the Scrunt and nearly killed. Then they realize the Guild is not correct and between a kid reading things in cereal boxes and his Dad finding clues in crosswords to shifting people and roles in Guild, I was simply confused because of the poor execution. We finally get one good scene when Cleveland has his catharsis and it was able to induce tears in audience members. But it simply comes back to the standard M.Night protagonist whom is trying to deal with personal tragedies. We saw this in Signs, The Village and again in this film. While that is a good thing to build a movie around, third time around is one too many. Finally, when things do play out as they should, we are scratching our heads and thinking ""Are we too stupid to understand this film, or is the film too stupid to understand."" I've noticed many fan reviews of this film and many liked it but I do tend to think they are way to kind to allow M.Night to have a folly. Lady in the Water is his first folly and I hope he will recover and wow us with his next film.",Lady in the Water
306,dougmarshall_94142,Oscar winner,9,26 July 2006,"Two-thirds through this movie, I said to myself, Paul Giammati is going to win an Oscar for this. I also said to myself, one of these days M.Night is going to be the main character. If this were a movie told in the usual Hollywood way, all the characters in the apartment building would have gone through at least an hour of thinking Story was crazy, or Heep was crazy. But they don't. They have come to regard Heep as a trusted man, and if he says this girl is a Narf, and we've got to help her, they do what they can to help. AND they do help. They did something, and what they did had a good affect on the outcome. There is your message. And its a good message. OK, not a Best Picture. But Best Actor?

I can't explain the story because even after multiple watching I don;t get it.It's all over the place with the storyline. First it seemed that the movie is taking place in the real world but then out of nowhere there are 100s of fantasy elements added. And people in the movie just accept everything weird going around them.The story of production of this movie is more entertaining and it shows how fame can get to someone's head.Overall don't watch it if you want to save your brain cells.,Lady in the Water
308,lee3993,From Alfred Hitchcock to Ed Wood,3,5 January 2007,"After viewing ""Lady in the Water"" at a local theater, I was so displeased and disgruntled that I had to go back and re-watch the excellent ""The Sixth Sense"" on DVD to assure myself that it was actually as good as ""it"" was. ""Lady in the Water"" and 2004's ""The Village"" were two movies that I highly anticipated seeing but were about as disappointing as I could imagine. After seeing ""The Sixth Sense"" and 2002's ""Signs"" I was beginning to believe that M. Night Shyamalan was destined to be the next Alfred Hitchcock of directors in the suspense/thriller genre. I could not have been more wrong. How can a director that was so good at creating elements of surprise and imagination fall from grace so rapidly. I guess I should have seen it coming though, because even though Sixth Sense and Signs were great, he did manage to sandwich 2000's ""Unbreakable"" between them.",Lady in the Water

310,dottyjyoung,"If I hadn't read 5000000 bedtime stories to my kid, it would have been different....",5,16 January 2007,"I have to give it an A for effort! What is a bedtime story? A cow jumps over a moon, a dish runs away with a spoon, a baby is rocking in a cradle that, for some ungodly reason, is on a treetop.......or a little duckling has lost it's mother and goes to the cow, the pig, and the horse to ask, ""Are you my mother?"" This is the effect that the Lady in the Water has on us. She is all dewey innocence and beauty, and says, ""I'm lost---are YOU the one I'm looking for?"" My incredibly verbal 16-month old will not go to bed without a two-story bedtime routine, so I've had a chance to *deeply* study this art form. :) Lady in the Water attempts to meld a bedtime story with comedy and heart-wrenching adult drama---HOW in the world is that accomplished?Well, by making a few mistakes. :) But since this movie almost defines a new GENRE, the grown-up-bedtime-story, we should allow for mistakes! Aren't we all hungry for something to surprise us in a theater? SinceI've only watched it once so far (and we have to take it back today) it's easier for me to remember those mistakes than it is to remember the high points. When I enjoy a movie, the mistakes are what bring me OUT of my fantasy-land and into movie-analysis land. The good parts just yank on my heartstrings.1) We could have done without the prologue. Could you imagine ""The Sixth Sense"" beginning with a little story about a boy who could talk to ghosts? It would have robbed the ""I see dead people"" scene of it's power. Since discovering your purpose is a huge controlling idea in this story, the prologue could have been incorporated into the action of the movie somehow.2) While I loved every single character in this movie, the Asian family's role wasn't used well. Every time Heep talked to them, the effect was, ""Here is your next plot point on a platter."" Since this is a bedtime story, why not have someone reading a story to a kid? Since kids can be both insatiably curious and very loose-lipped, that kid could follow Heep around, annoying the living daylights out of the janitor with this story his grandmother tells him, until one day he says the word ""Narf"". That's just a thought, but you get my point. If I, as an audience, am TOLD what to expect next, it takes the wind right out of my sails.3) Reggie, the right-sided body builder, was virtually unknown to us, then comes in and saves the day. Towards the end, my husband said, ""That body builder guy is probably the guardian. He's the only character who hasn't had a payoff."" I said, ""I would have thought so too, but we haven't seen him for over an hour. It would be pretty weird for him to be SUDDENLY brought back into the movie like that."" Then, lo and behold, drumroll please, Reggie is the guardian! Maybe I'm just mad that hubby won the bet, lol, but there was something off about leaving a major character out of the movie, and bringing him in like Athena on the lowered platform at the end of the story.4) The movie critic's death dialogue was too long. He needed a reason to stay there. Shivering, wetting himself, shaking and sloshing his cup, whatever---something needed to keep him in place instead of talking into the camera.5) We find out that the writer's going to die for his beliefs. The writer doesn't seem to react to that very much, so why even have that information in the story? All he says is, ""Don't tell my sister."" That knowledge doesn't create a crisis of belief for the character (or if it does, it lasts a fraction of a second and still doesn't affect the story.) It EITHER needed to be cut, or be opened up for exploration.I loved the ensemble cast. I loved Heep's deep wound opening up and being healed by *his* act of healing. I really liked the 1-armed body builder just because he was weird, and I love butterflies and bedtime stories. This movie was great, and it could have been even better if someone had seen the genre blend and stopped saying ""This is really weird"" long enough to give the script the attention it needed. :) I just hope Shamaylan keeps making movies.Dotty J.

And, while most who have written a review here have either loved or hated this movie, my feelings lay somewhere in the middle. M. Night Shyamalan shows us a piece that is a bit more self-indulgent, unnatural and ill-conceived than Six sense, Signs or even The Village. Unlike previous Shyamalan films, I found it difficult to fall in love with the characters. Rather than face imminent terror most of these characters were called to fantasy. This film did have a few redeeming qualities, such as artfully crafted chills and a unique, creative, albeit off-beat, story. Not enough to rank high in my book though. I really hope this is not the direction of Shyamalan's future films. If it is, he has lost one fan.",Lady in the Water

314,u2bme102,A Terrific Movie! The best of the summer flicks CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERS,9,20 July 2006,"I saw this tonight at a preview. It is the best of the summer flicks so far, and would be the best movie of the year if not for United 93.From the previews, I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised.The movie is based on a bedtime story M. Knight Shyamalan made up for his daughters. M enjoys telling modern fairy tales, and this one is a doozy! (note - there is no twist ending) This is his strongest movie since Sixth Sense. I enjoyed Unbreakable and Signs (I didn't see The Village), but neither movie lived up to Sixth Sense. This one didn't either, but only missed by a little.During several scenes, the entire audience (and the theater was packed) was completely silent, with the exception of a crying infant whose parents mistakenly brought to the theater. This should give you an idea of the involvement of the audience in the movie.I'm not going to tell you anything about the plot, because I would not want to give anything away.I found the fairy tale to be contrived, but the way in which M let the story unfold was terrific! In addition, he knows a sense of humor will help along a movie, and several of the scenes (including the very first scene) had the audience laughing out loud! M put himself in the movie in a part which left me wondering if he has had visions of his own future. He was quite good. In fact, the entire cast was terrific, and included outstanding actors such as Tovah Feldshuh, Sarita Choudury, Cindy Cheung, Bob Balaban, and Mary Beth Hurt, among others. oh, and Bryce Dallas Howard, daughter of Ron Howard.Lady in the Water was definitely worth the price of admission plus a large popcorn and medium soda. I would have given it a large soda if M had left a little to the imagination at the end of the movie.",Lady in the Water

I loved the way Bryce Dallas Howard portrayed her: this beautiful young actress made a deep impression on me and I certainly want to see other movies of her.

317,jpmd88,What was he thinking?,1,19 July 2006,"The first time I saw the trailer for this film was about year ago inside a movie house. It showed a lot of promise, I was even mesmerized as it used Josh Groban's Mi Mancherai to great effect which left the viewer with such a teaser that I could not wait to know more about the film and its plot. Soon after wards a lot of internet hype went into this film based upon the fact that a lot of people are anticipating M. Night Shyamalan's movies. With the lackluster ""The Village"" as this film's predecessor it was time to look into a refreshing albeit familiar direction one expects of M. Night and after a year or so of waiting I finally saw it tonight. It is by far, the most unimaginative of all of M. Night Shyamalan's films and to me the most self-indulgent. Most of the time the film seems to be trying too hard to put that mystery and suspense that it feels contrived. I have also noticed a shift in his story telling style particularly his use of a lot of ""Hollywood special effects"" instead of the use of natural surroundings to create that distinct Shyamalan style of storytelling suspense which I loved and saw in his previous films. This feels like a sell out film and I think a wee bit egotistical to put himself as an important though not central character instead of his usual cameo appearance. This I think was the most detrimental to an already obtuse storyline. In closing, I think he should go back to the style that he became famous for and not try too hard to get lost in his own myth and persona.",Lady in the Water
318,standeman1984,I'm sorry but no....,4,30 July 2006,"As a fan of the man himself, I feel the best way to describe M Night Shyamalan's latest work is as childish, naive and pretty boring. The first 30 minutes are slow and introduce characters clumsily, Paul Giamatti does his best with a script that even idiot Hollywood execs would find badly written. Shyamalan has created a fairytale, just not a particularly good or captivating one.It appeared to me that Shyamalan was trying to appeal to a young female demographic, after appealing mainly to young males with Unbreakable (the whole mermaid-like fairytale as opposed to the comic book superhero). Now being a male maybe i didn't quite connect with it as he intended, so my opinion probably isn't that important, but i can only look at it from my perspective. It didn't draw me in and was quite often pretentious and forced, as though Shyamalan was ticking off fairytale on his to-do list of films. However, i do feel it had some redeeming qualities around the middle mark.As the story finally gets a bit of momentum after Cleveland (Giamatti) and Story (Howard) have sat around with very little happening or developing, and the discovery of one of the apartment's residents knowing the story of, erm, Story (i see what he did there, wow!), the plot begins to roll along as Cleveland unravels more of the fairytale which she is from and himself and his residents become embroiled in the fairytale themselves. This was my favourite part of the film, as all the characters realise their roles in the fairytale and quite hesitantly begin to take them on in order to help this mysterious woman. That was fine, and worked very well, as did the cynical writer played by Bob Balaban who presumes to know the plot and ending to all stories and films which, as he puts it, is because there is no originality anymore. You can see that Night was using this as a mouthpiece to speak to viewers like me who presumed to know how it would all end. I liked that, the only problem is, having done that, you didn't surprise me Shyamalan. The ending plays out exactly as it should, minus any shocks and twists we have come to expect from you. I was left thinking, so....what? That was it? That's the story? You can kind of see what Night was trying to do, and i do praise him for some originality, and he is quite good as the character he plays in the film, as are the rest of the cast. The negatives concern firstly, a very unscary monster as the threat, a patchy script, a ridiculous fairy story at its heart full of religious references whereby the eponymous Lady and her people are the saviours of the human race, a presumption by Shyamalan that we are all going to sit through his films wide eyed and expectant, taking in all he throws at us without question or objection. The film also lacked enough exploration of doubt around this character or where she had come from. Everyone just goes 'oh, right, she's from a fairytale, so how do we get her back'. A little more realism would have worked well and given her story more impact. It may sound strange but i found it harder to believe cos everyone was finding it so easy to, and by the end you're just left frowning.Some bits were good, especially the one sided body builder, but the rest was bad and just made me angry. But i'm interested to know if it was just me. Either way, i think Shyamalan's gonna be struggling to get financing for his next project as easily as he must have done for this one, and i hope it is less self worthy and more capable of firing up my imagination as his previous films have managed to do.",Lady in the Water
319,wolverinejmc,Great entertainment,10,21 July 2006,"Lady in the water, the newest film from M. Night Shyamalan, might just be his most original and most entertaining movie. There were so many things that were extremely likable. One great feature was the great array of characters. i have never laughed so much in a suspense movie because of characters. the level of suspense, or lack there of, is also a bonus of this movie. When Night wants to scare you, he will with his trademark creepiness and his jump moments. But many people have forgotten that this is a fairy tale, and when Night wants to be in awe of the original story, and trust him on its many twists and turns, he will make those moments very charming. There are many shots of the Lady, and sometimes she may just be standing there, but there is something very storybook-esque, that keeps your eyes riveted to the screen. The moral to this story is a very true one too. Finding your purpose on earth, and using the powers that were given to you to make everything better in life. There have been many movies that are shown during the summer season, but Lady stands out a a small fairytale that will charm you to the credits, and will have you thinking about it after the lights in the theater come up.",Lady in the Water

The acting is laughable (I ended up laughing a lot throughout this movie) and the overall environment didn't do it for me either.

I mean so MANY plot holes and question marks that not even swiss cheese has that many holes combined. Stay away from this movie.,Lady in the Water
322,VideoJoeD,One of the Few!,1,14 February 2007,"A significant number of IMDb voters have assigned either a maximum 10 or minimum 1 rating to this film. I have viewed a couple of thousand films (not an exaggeration)over the years and would assign these extreme positive or negative values to fewer than 100 of these films. Unfortunately, this film is one that I have selected for an extreme negative rating. I was very disappointed with this rental. I normally try to avoid viewing films which I have any serious doubts about in theaters. I did have a few doubts about this film, but there were several reasons why I anticipated that I would find it entertaining even if I did not find it to be exceptional.One reason, was the cast which was headed up by Paul Giamatti and also included Mary Beth Hurt. There are several films in which these stars displayed their considerable talents (Sideways, Cinderella Man, The World According to Garp, Compromising Positions, etc.) that I have enjoyed and which are also a part of my own personal film library. Another reason was the writer/director (M. Night Shyamalan) who also wrote and directed The Sixth Sense (which is also a part of my personal film library). Although both of these Shyamalan works project haunting surreal type atmospheres and involve plots which are not normal run-of-the-mill story lines, the differences in the two were immense in my personal opinion. The Sixth Sense presented an off-beat story, but one that I could truly get involved in. The Lady in the Water was also unusual, but one that I could not envision or be drawn into. This plot revolved around an ancient bedtime fable which slowly unraveled. Although the acting was extremely professional, the way the films' characters accepted and acted upon the various elements of the fable was incredulous and too difficult for me to relate to.It is obvious by the voting tabulation, that not all viewers agree with my assessment. That is what makes many aspects of the IMDb site intriguing and valuable to members and other visitors. Movie viewers may want to decide for themselves what their reaction to this film will be, but they should be alerted to the fact that even if they thoroughly enjoyed The Sixth Sense they may not have a similar reaction to this film.",Lady in the Water
323,SandyLiz,Strange and Unique,10,7 August 2006,"This movie is a unique and strange work of art. It cannot be compared to any other movie made...the cinematography was very artistic and amazing to see, the plot was not predictable (unable to guess what was coming next.) This movie is ""adult fairy tale"" or a mega-fantasy and as such was magnificent. I was thinking as I left the theater that this country needs more fantasy without war, killing, monsters, etc. This one was suspenseful, at points scary, and even humorous, but otherwise it was gripping in a wholesome, deep, archetypal way. I especially like the fact that M. Knight played a bigger role in this movie than others. He is a genius, as far as I am concerned, in writing and directing. And not hard on the eyes either. The movie is full of layers and layers of symbolism; so more than one viewing is advised. If you go to see it, just watch it and don't try to analyze or compare it to anything you have ever experienced before. Suspend your disbelief (like your inner child wants you to, the way the people in the movie did. Thanks for that, by the way.) It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will amaze you. (And yes, it is different than Shamalyan's other movies. SO? That's GOOD. We don't want a creative genius stuck in a rut or sucking up to hollywooded-up stereotypical pressure, huh?) And above all, don't even try to compare it to any thing else. It stands alone and is incomparable. I think I am going to purchase the movie when it comes out of DVD. I want to read some of the dialog on closed captioning. Additionally, the lead character Paul Giamatti was beyond excellent. He's a gigantic talent -- this movie will help moviegoers overcome the Hollywood stereotype that a magnificent actor/lead character has to be pretty and sexy. Be sure to see it with an open mind and enjoy the movie for what it is without trying to force it to fit a preconceived notion about stories and movies. It's a round peg and will not fit into a square hole. My rating, beyond 10.",Lady in the Water

The characters are rich, odd, funny and just like the sort of bizarre folks you meet in a small rental unit.
The idea of a new fairytale is wonderful, beautiful, and Giamatti gives an astonishing tear worth monologue at one point that broke my heart and made me long for faith.

The acting as usual was very good, shyamalan is able to get the most out of his actors.There's a kind of twist in the end, which i really liked, though at first i wasn't able to interpret it but when i though for a minute or two i understood the beauty of the twist.I will surely recommend this movie to everyone because once you will watch it only then can u understand the intense or warmth of the movie.",Lady in the Water

It's obvious that those doing the reviews have no idea what this movie is about, and could care less. M.Night's Shyamalan's work is too intellectual, and too brilliant for them to understand. A superb cast, an exceptional script, fantastic photography, and delicious humor, make this one of the best summer movies around. The twists and turns it takes are Shyamalan's cleverest yet.The cost of a movie here is now $10, and this movie is worth every penny of it.",Lady in the Water
327,imaginarytruths,Hollow misguided vanity project disguised as a paean to childlike innocence,3,26 July 2006,"This film actively made me angry. Shyamalan has the skills to be possibly the greatest director of horror thrillers ever, but I feel like he constantly mistakes having style for having philosophical depth. In the past this hasn't prevented me from enjoying his films. So what if the symbolism is corny and obvious? So what if he's more interested in faking out the audience that in logical progression and story coherence? So what if he was constantly implying that there was some big important New Age message but in the end only delivers homilies? His films were well-acted and delivered thrills, so what difference did it make if some of his loftier ambitions didn't pan out? LitW represents all of Shyamalan's worst tendencies taken to extremes in the context of a metafilm that raises Shyamalan to the level of intellectual Christ and devalues the humanity of his critics. It's not merely an interesting experiment that didn't work or an auteur being a little too self-indulgent...it's vile.",Lady in the Water
328,vincentgeorge-98430,M Night's descent continues.,6,24 December 2018,"How far has M. Night's career fallen? This is just a bad film whichever way yu look. It is the biggest misfire of M. Night Shyamalan's career, including his pre-Sixth Sense movies. In addition to being dull and uninvolving, the film fails to draw in the viewer sufficiently to facilitate suspension of disbelief, which allows the plot to resemble a rejected Ed Wood screenplay. There's probably a cult following that's going to love the film, and laud its spiritual overtones and none-too-subtle redemption motif. To me, however, it felt silly and artificial. When a filmmaker tells a story that transports the audience into an alternate reality, his first objective must be to get the viewers to believe in this world. Shyamalan doesn't do that. He assumes we'll accept it, and that mistake sinks the movie. Not having bought into the story, we spend nearly two hours making fun of the grass-backed wolf, the shocked monkeys, and a bunch of other missteps.",Lady in the Water
329,Hotwyre6,About average on the Shyamalan scale,6,30 July 2006,"It is a likable enough movie for a patient audience. If one is inclined to watch a plot unfold carefully, taking up time others might consider to be ill spent, Lady in the Water will not seem a boring film. But there will be a significant percentage of the theater goers bored by the pace.Setting that aspect of the film aside for the remainder of the review, this one comes out in the middle of his five big movies; not nearly as good as the masterful Unbreakable, but better than the disappointment that was Signs. One can never accuse Shyamalan of lacking in creativity, and Lady certainly has that. It has some highly entertaining moments and probably will leave a smile on the face of the viewer by the time the film ends.The problems come from the fact that certain plot devices are just too contrived. There are simply elements that could have been made more believable, an important aspect if one is going to tell a modern fairy tale and have it taken seriously as a film. But overall this story is one that audiences will probably be glad Shyamalan told, despite the few slipshod moments interstitially woven into the fabric of the plot.",Lady in the Water
330,vince_montgomery,A new fairy tale,7,6 August 2006,"Much of the talk about ""Lady In The Water"" has been unkind, I won't re-hash it here, but I do wonder why it's so negative.It doesn't interest me how this film compares with the other Shyamalan films. Seems to me that most comparisons are quite a stretch, and unfair. ""Lady In The Water"" is a fairy tale. A fairy tale based on an original fairy tale world. That is just one reason why I give Shyamalan credit. I don't know of many who have created an original mythology. Lucas didn't, nor did Spielberg; even Roddenberry wasn't completely original, his ideas were, even if the space travel wasn't. Shyamalan did create a new mythology and dropped it in the middle of our 21st century lives. That strikes me as very new and creative. Like most here, I heard versions of Little Red Riding Hood and all the others, when I was a child. As I recall these these now, the secondary characters have specific roles they perform to aid the hero/heroine toward the happy ending. They where not intended to be complete characters, just helping along the way. They may have benefited, or may have just done their bit and moved on. This is seen in Lady in the Water, no one character in the film could have completed the end of the story alone, a team effort was required. There isn't a need to go into all the fairy tale-esquire detail, you know what I'm getting at, right? None of this is a bad thing.This film has great performances all around, humor, suspense and sadness, add to that Shyamalan's patient and slightly voyeuristic style that draws the viewer in, and you have a wonderful story.",Lady in the Water
331,abajoue,Shyamalan brings IMAGINATION back to film!,9,27 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan's movies tend to trigger one of 3 knee-jerk reactions in viewers: (1) you love them; (2) you hate them; or (3) you don't understand them. After seeing some abysmal critics' reviews for LITW, I honestly went into the theater with pretty low expectations, and was pleasantly, and impressively, surprised by this movie. LITW is truly a modern fairy tale / bedtime story for grown-ups. It is a cerebral fantasy movie that demands equal parts thinking-cap and imagination from the viewer, but if you are willing to let Shyamalan lead you through the story, the rewards are well worth it. On the other hand, if you are not prepared to follow the abundant nuances, metaphors, symbolism, and subtle character developments in LITW, and are looking for a cut-and-dry thriller or light weekend fare, then this is not your movie. I think that some viewers (and critics) didn't really understand LITW, because they wouldn't let themselves take in all of the stylistic originality and artistry that the movie has to offer.I won't spoil the movie (for those who haven't seen it), by describing the plot/character details here. But, suffice it to say that you are so busy becoming engrossed in the characters and the story, and trying to figure out the riddles in this movie, that it is only at the end that you realize the LITW has left you with a lesson that makes you think well after leaving the movie theater. The movie's subtle, but powerful messages about true leadership, catharsis through altruism, the power of human togetherness, and self-discovery resonated with me and other viewers who were willing to open their minds enough to see them. LITW is not a movie that can be enjoyed ""on the surface."" You have to either totally immerse yourself in the movie, or not watch it at all. Otherwise, you're left with a sense of dissatisfaction that some viewers have reported feeling at the end of the movie. On a related side-note, I can't help but think that the way many negative movie critics reacted to LITW had, at least, something to do with Shyamalan's tongue-in-cheek portrayal of the movie-critic character in the movie. After all, the movie critic is a know-it-all who almost derails the other characters' efforts with his high-and-mighty (and ultimately WRONG) advice. Shyamalan had the guts to slyly thumb his nose at the movie-critic establishment, and was, of course rewarded with excessively bitter reviews from some of the targets of his fun-poking. Mere coincidence? I think not.I am typically not one for fairy tale or fantasy movies, because the plots and characters seem so far removed from reality that I can't relate to them. For that reason, neither the Lord of the Rings nor the Harry Potter films moved me much. I think it says a lot about LITW and Shyamalan's unique style that I actually came to CARE about the characters and the outcome of their story. Balancing suspension of disbelief with elements of reality is a difficult and delicate task; one which I think Shyamalan pulls off very well with LITW. The characters all seem so real (like people you might find in your neighborhood), but yet you don't find it odd that they all participate so whole-heartedly in a scenario that goes far beyond the logical and explainable. If J.K. Rowling can invent ""muggles,"" why shouldn't Shyamalan have his ""narfs"" and ""scrunts,"" especially when he uses them to such wonderful effect? At the end of this movie, the kid in me wanted to cheer. Shyamalan achieves a fairly-tale ending without melodrama or sensationalism, while still leaving the viewer feeling positive and uplifted. After all, isn't that the whole point of a fairy tale? ;-)",Lady in the Water
332,sparkster24,A typical M. Night Shyamalan film?,8,24 August 2006,"Lady In The Water is a story about an oriental fable which comes to life for one man - Cleveland (played by Paul Giamatti). However, just to avoid any confusion, in reality this story is neither oriental nor mythical  it comes straight from the creative brain of M. Night Shyamalan  the director of Unbreakable, The Signs, Stuart Little and The Sixth Sense. The anecdote is about a Narf (which is a type of Sea Nymph,) who comes from 'the other side' to save our souls. However, despite the confusing summary of this film, the relationship between Cleveland and Young Soon (played by Cindy Cheung) helps the audience understand the mythological framework in which this film conducts itself. In this way, considering the complexity of the task in hand for Shyamalan, he has pulled of a stroke of genius. As the fable begins to develop the film follows.So, the Narf, who is called Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard), attempts to return home (according to IMDb.com although, I don't actually remember the film stating that -) and save humanity from its own vice. The idea of this story is clearly based on the Christian doctrine of Original Sin. Story is benevolent in her motive and, as per usual, humans are the bad guys. Story is waiting for an eagle to transport her back home crowning her the 'Madam Nark' (Queen Nark if you like), where she will put an end to our evil. Again, here we can see similarities between Jesus and Story. Even physically Story's pellucid complexion is angelically white  coincidence? I think not. Cleveland, who discovered Story in the swimming pool, takes it upon himself to care for her. As the story unwinds we discover Cleveland's family was murdered and that looking after Story gives him a purpose in life.There is, of course, the enemy who are a group of mythological creatures that want to kill Story so the evil of man may continue. For protection against the slayers, Story has been divinely delegated a guardian, a healer, a guild and a symbolist - the only problem is she doesn't know who her 'protectors' are other than the fact they are human. Thus, on one side there is the 'nasty' human species who are trying to save her whilst, on the other, there are some fantasy beasts who are trying to kill her. There is no explanation as to why the fantasy beasts are trying to kill her  I guess the 'devil' doesn't really need an explanation for its intrinsic malevolence.Moreover, as consistently indicated throughout this extract, I think there is a strong fundamental link between religion and this film which is what will AND does produce a very strong response  whether it's positive or negative. The film is brilliant in parts but at times I fear Shyamalan has got caught up in trying to give us a 'who is it?' as opposed to concentrating on the essential parts of the film. To make a fair judgement of this film, it is a case of weighing up the positives (e.g. the intertextual references to the Scream(1996)-type-comedy where the film parodies a novelist's basic narrative guidelines) against some the negatives (e.g. the weak narrative structure in places - I never felt any kind of attachment to any of the characters).Overall Shyamalan tried to do too much in this film. Unfortunately for us, he had done the hard part and forgotten about the easier things such as that suggested above.",Lady in the Water

I went with some trepidation having disliked the village so much, then the critics. Well I was overwhelmingly pleasantly surprised. If folks are looking for a lot of action this isn't the movie for you. If however you are patient enough to let the story unfold in its own time, you will love it.Highly relevant thought provoking story telling, that touches upon current themes both globally and personal, he intertwines this with a master storytellers gift. At times touching, at others ludicrous, other times tragic, and then there is hope but all of these elements are needed to tell the tale, no super special effects required, nothing needs to be blown up to get its point across.Gorgeous story by a Master Storyteller....My favorite movie of the year thus far and that is saying a lot as I think most films well are crap.",Lady in the Water

I loved this story, and Bryce has been one of my favorite actors for a while and also Freddy Rodrigez :) This movie was just fun and spooky and strange all at the same time. I can't wait to see what else he'll been working on in the future. Did anyone else crack up at the part in the beginning when Cleveland was killing the spider or mouse or whatever it was under the sink and everyone behind kept screaming??

335,ctizon,Bizarre...but that's not to say it wasn't a good watch,8,23 July 2006,"I really did like this movie. I have liked every single one of Shyamalan's movies thus far (yes, even ""The Village""). I feel that critics are unjustly bashing everything about it...but, while I do love the movie, I can see why many would dislike it.I'm still not completely sure what the heck I watched...yes, I did love it. I loved the way it made me feel, the wonder and everything. However, it was really out there. It involved a water nymph with changing hair colors, a fat wolf with grass for fur, evil tree monkeys, a gigantic eagle, a guy that has one arm 4.5 inches buffer than the other, a punked out study-freak Asian teenage girl, and Paul Giamatti trying to pretend to be a kid by curling up in a couch after eating cookies and drinking milk. Yes...this is definitely not a typical movie, even for M. Night Shyamalan.I thought there were a few discrepancies with the plot...like, how did Story (wtf was with her name, anyway?) end up in the pool? How did nobody notice this door thing down there in stark daylight, yet Giamatti's character finds it in the middle of the night? However, the direction and cinematography more than make up for this. The wet, dreary atmosphere is present all throughout (with an undercurrent of wonder and oddness), and I loved every bit of it. The acting was great, although I was a bit surprised that Shyamalan's role was so big this time around. He was pretty good anyway, even though he wasn't given much to do.I will admit, however, that I burst out laughing at a few moments of the dialogue. When Giamatti awakens to Story, one of the first things she says is ""Do you feel an awakening? It should feel like pins and needles"". Now THAT line had me howling. And the terms for the creatures alone were pretty out there... ""narf"" and ""scrunt"". They're pretty funny words. But, I guess that doesn't matter.Another criticism would definitely be the critic character. His character stuck out like a sore thumb, was completely misplaced, and his death scene was just...bad. I can stretch my mind for some logic, but his dialogue in this scene was just inexcusable. I was like ""Good lord...just shut up and die already."" And that's not a good thing.All in all, I thought it was a pretty captivating film (also with a great score) with an interesting message about humanity and an outstanding fairy tale type of mood (and no...not the sweet Disney sugar-coated fairy tale type). I do recommend it, but don't go into it expecting anything. Because there's really nothing to expect. This film is such a mish-mash of completely new subjects and is so outlandish that you shouldn't go into it expecting anything. If you do, you may be disappointed. I went into it not knowing what to expect...and I'm pretty glad I did. If I was expecting a straight-up fantasy or a horror film, I would have been let down in both departments.Just don't have any prior thoughts, see the movie, and wonder about it. Whether or not you like it, you will have to admit that it has some sort of affect on you, be it the atmosphere or the odd situations. It's certainly not a movie you will forget any time soon.",Lady in the Water

If you were asked to perform in a 'ceremony' that sends a girl back to another world - wouldn't you want to know just a little bit more! No not in this movie, the characters just shrug their shoulders and do as they are told. Believability is NIL. The worst parts are the development of the story, with the main male character acting 'thinking', most of the time you've usually guessed the outcome or he dashes off and the result is so improbable that you just think WHAT. The girl is absolutely pathetic as an actress and the part she plays you just wish she'd get eaten by the monster with lots of blood and gore just to get rid of her.

I found signs slow, boring and taking itself too seriously, and didn't even bother to go to the village because the trailer even made me feel bored. Not so with Lady in the Water though. It seems to me that this movie doesn't take itself as seriously as signs did, and as a result dares to be humorous. The characters are quite convincing, but at the same time they can be hilarious in their own subtle (or in some cases less subtle) ways. The story that is told, is entertaining, brought well, and doesn't become predictable at all (even though I did guess some things right halfway through the movie). If you go see this movie, don't go in expecting some dazzling plot (and certainly don't go overthinking it) or mindblowing action scenes, just sit back and enjoy the movie for what it is. I used to be one of the people that overanalyzed every movie but honestly, since I let that go, I can enjoy movies a lot more. If you can watch without prejudice, go see this movie, you'll thoroughly enjoy it. When I watched this movie, there weren't too many people in the cinema with me (which might also be because it was a 5 PM showing, not typically a crowded time), but of the people that were there a lot of them didn't immediately get up when the credits started, which is usually a sign that people were impressed with the movie (I know I was).

We go to be, entertained, to laugh, to cry, to scream, to feel, to imagine, to escape, to wonder & question To hope, to dream, to fantasize to believe, to inspire, and to jump, way out of our seats... and so guess what? You will do all off these. In an article in USA Today, 7/19, director Shyamalan, (Six Sense, Signs, The Village) says, he was concerned how about this horror/fantasy/comedy/drama, would do with the critics, but mostly with the audiences. Well, in my opinion he should have nothing to worry about. I don't see how anyone could not like this movie because there is something in it for everyone. Paul Giamatti convincingly plays the Apt Building super, and does a fantastic job of it as well as Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron Howard's Daughter) as the pale skinned sea nymph, that he tries to save. I know that most movie studios do these ""pre-movie"" screenings, so they can get a feel for how audiences will feel about it, to see if they like it or not. Well when I saw it and it was over, the fully packed theater was applauding. Hey ya know what, if the critics don't like it, so be it. But don't listen them and go see it anyway.

Great fun to watch and and an awesome story worth watching in a film. Lady in the Water can be said to be nothing special but it is. Its a bedtime story put into a film that really doesn't disappoint the film fan of all ages.Paul Giamatti is fantastic playing the main character who finds the sea nymph in the pool. He brightens the movie going experience when he is able to make this roll so believable. Giamatti makes it more than what it is with a masterful performance in a film that in many peoples eyes is less than a sub par movie.Lady in the Water is only good to those who keep an open mind when watching movies. Keeping an open mind during this one makes it that much better and that much more fun to watch.Great film with nothing that really disappointed me it was fun to watch and very original from start to finish. Bryce Dallas Howard is one great actress. She doesn't come off as one who needs to be focused upon but she can let others take the spotlight even when she may be playing the main and most important character in the film.

341,megunticook,"Don't go near the ""Water""",1,25 July 2006,"This film was terrible. Forehead slapping leaps of logic, way too precious in performance and a ""message"" that should inspire the audience but only serves to deflate it (while simultaneously framing the film's writer-director as its symbol--the ultimate irony), ""The Lady in the Water"" couldn't be enjoyed even by the children for whom it was apparently written. Utterly useless waste of time and resources on the part of everyone involved (including the audience). That's pretty much all I have to say about it, but I need ten lines to be elligible for posting. There's only so many ways you can say a movie truly is terrible, too terrible to consider watching. Even an insomniac couldn't be put to sleep by this thing.

342,elandyll,Very good modern day Fairy Tale,8,26 July 2006,"M Night Shyamalan is a talented director. Well, I do think so, in any case. But I cannot say that I find all his films to be equally good either. From a true masterpiece with the 6th sense (starting with a mega hit can be a problem), he went to a radically different theme with still a very formulaic treatment in ""Unbreakable"". I found this story of ""realistic"" superhero/Villain opposition excellent, but he did apparently disappoint his larger public, looking for more ""conventional"" thrillers it seemed. Then on to ""Signs"", which was in the opinion of many a step down from ""Unbreakable"", though still good. And then ""The Village"", which probably was the biggest let down from Mr Shyamalan, while I found the visuals and treatment to be oho superior to ""Signs"". Let us only say that M. Night is very uneven in what he can produce.I am happy to say that ""Lady in the Water"" is amongst his best work to date, but certainly will surprise if not infuriate his more traditional thriller core audience. Once again, the director uses his old demon (last minute surprise), but it works very well here -much better so than in ""The Village"", or even ""Signs""- and let us really feel for the characters.The acting was excellent over the board (with a special mention for Paul Giamatti as Cleveland Heep. The visuals and effects were equally good, and the story was what I was expecting: a modern day fairy tale (and one that started as a bed-time story fairy tale that M Night was inventing for his children).My only problem during the movie was with ""actor"" M Night, not because he is inherently a bad actor (notice, he is not that good either), but because you can't help thinking ""Hey, that's the director!"" each time you see him on screen. For a short apparition, it works. For a secondary cast that you see about 10-15 minutes during the movie, it is unnecessarily distracting.Others might also have a problem with his little ""Vendetta"" with critics during the movie, but I found it rather enjoyable if a bit ""in-your-face"".In the end, for all of us with an inner Child still, this is a wonderful movie, and should let you hope that you'll get to visit ""The Blue World"" someday.8/10",Lady in the Water
343,dentonsfarm,Simple Movie With Complex Meaning,9,23 July 2006,"I love this movie as I love every Shyamalan movie; from the Sixth Sense to the present, Lady in the Water. However, this film takes a somewhat different approach in its unraveling. No one really questions whether or not the character STORY is really a Nymph. Each character seems to accept the seemingly impossible as being very real and genuine; something we as adults loose at some point in our lives.This movie is about simple people with simple faith. Where the diversity of the melting-pot of characters should be, commonality dominates. Everyone, the world, has a common history. And no matter where you were born or how your life is lived we all share in that same ancient heritage.",Lady in the Water
344,thunderfoot1812,Well worth watching -- several times,9,24 June 2009,"I strongly recommend seeing this movie for yourself and making up your own mind.This is a special movie, and very much unlike the usual Hollywood fare. Its most outstanding quality is that it tells a story, and takes you to another world (hey -- that's not such a bad thing when you go to the *movies* right?) with almost nothing but camera work, sound, the script, and acting, to do so. It has the feel of, ""So let's see, we've got this apartment building, with a pool, let's get some cameras and some friends together and make a movie!"" Personally I would much rather see, and hear, something unusual like this -- but yet which works very well -- than just sit through another re-tred of the tired Hollywood formula. Because the storytelling here is so strong, you just drop into a believable, but completely odd, world played out inside a few motel-style apartments and next to a motel-style pool.Structurally the story is full of symbolic characters -- even named outright as ""the healer"" ""the protector"" and so on. The bedtime-story style also gives us an interesting, and rich, set of well-defined characters using very little screen-time, and very few words. Nothing is wasted.There is humor in the movie too, with some playful bits from Shyamalan himself, an Asian mother-and-daughter comedy team, and a deadpan Bob Balaban.Paul Giamatti is, as usual, just right as the everyman.M. Night Shyamalan is a wonderful craftsman, a great storyteller, and a director/writer that will wear very well over the years.This is not a horror movie (my five-year-old liked it and yours probably would too -- although you'll want to cover their eyes a few times). It does not have sex scenes, or get into deep adult emotions. On the other hand, it is not a fairy-tale for kids either. It is more of a fairy-tale for cultures, that only hints at a fill-in-your-own grand message.There is a mystery to be solved, and some action too, but these are not really the main point of the movie -- the story is the kind where you can enjoy it just as much the second time around. I suppose the biggest mystery, to me, is how they managed to spend $75 million making this film!A good thing about this movie, which is true of all the M. Night movies I have seen, and also is true of all good filmmakers, is that you could drop in on any thirty-second slice of this movie, completely out of context, and it would have something to offer.While many movies will show a flash of popular interest when their ads are still bombarding us and their stars are currently popular, most of those are going to fade into obscurity while this movie continues to get checked off the shelves for years to come.I recommend it.",Lady in the Water
345,mbidemi2002,The Amazing Shyamalan,9,3 October 2006,"I am an M. Night Shyamamlan fan so forgive me if this turns out to be an eulogy rather than anything else. I have often called him the preacher who whispers but with this film i think he finally shouted all he has been trying to say with his previous films.The story of this movie is brilliant to say the least and carries a powerful and moving message that we all can learn from that each has a purpose, that everything happens for a reason, that hope is not a stupid thing to have and above all life is a wonder.I love the way Shyamalan dares us to believe in the extraordinary, it is a challenge he throws us almost like a man on a mountain shouting, come all who dare! He is a brilliant Director and the way he steered us flawlessly through this eclectic, magical and almost unbelievable tale has left me in no doubt whatsoever of his genius, not that I was ever in any doubt.Here is one Director who promises us a future of well scripted, wonderfully directed films. Thanks.",Lady in the Water
346,plegowik,"An okay movie, but what ego!",7,26 July 2006,"As a movie from a different point of view, this is a good movie. I really appreciated the anti-heroic main character and the un-Hollywood nature of the actors (not all perfect beings and an ethnic mix that reflects contemporary American society fairly well); and the fairy tale nature of the story was very appealing. Everything fits together well, and the meta-fictive aspects of the story were amusing. However, when the ego of the story's creator comes through in an attempt both to stroke his own ego and to lambaste the critics, I have a hard time taking the movie seriously. I thought the brother resembled the author, whom I saw in a television interview last week. Turns out, it was Shyamalan himself portraying the brother, who is . . . a writer, of course. The pity party of his foreseen death is really too much to take, not to mention the reference to the greatness of his work. Gag me! Shyamalan could take a lesson from Shakespeare's self-effacing creation of dramatic art.",Lady in the Water
347,blashco,horrible,1,22 July 2006,"Hey, I just saw the movie titled in the subject, here is my review.The SIxth Sense marked the debut of M. Night's fame and popularity. The atmosphere and vibe that he created, along with a clever plot and a twist ending made movie-goers everywhere realize the importance of Shyamalan. He, to some extent, created a cult following.Now, four movies later, many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense. With the OK-at-best movie Unbreakable, people were wondering if he was just a one-hit-wonder director. Then, with Signs, there was some hope that he would make a comeback.But, then he released The Village. After he lost thousands of fans due to that horrendous movie, he attempts at making another good movie. He most certainly fails.The movie places a stuttering man who lost his entire family in an Apartment complex. He, as the super, notices someone swimming late at night. This is the Lady from the title. You see, M. Night created an entire ""Bed Time Story"" about how land people used to coexist with the people of the ""Blue World"" (the ocean). These people speak English. But Land people got greedy and started fighting. But the Blue World people stayed pure, like water, as the Super points out. To help out the greedy people, huge birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land, and they must confront a ""Chosen One"" (no really, that is how the put it) and show them the way. The way the chosen one is directed will end up helping the land people as a whole.The Chosen One is, of course, M. Night himself. He can write, direct, produce and now act. He must be the chosen one.Anyways, there are wolves that aren't wolves, but are Scants or something. Their fur is grass and they are green. So that is why no person has seen them. These Scants attack people from the Blue World, but not the land. But there are rules. The night that the Snarf (lady of the blue world, The main Lady) returns to the blue world, the cannot attack them. If they do, these monkeys that aren't monkeys will kill them. There are three. And they are also made out of grass. But normal Scants wont attack Snarfs unless they are Rogue Scants. And those usually wont do it either, unless the Snarf is a Madame Snarf. And she is.So now the protagonist, Cleveland must find people to help him.You see, there are some normal people that help the Snarfs. Among the people are the Healer, the Guardian, the Guild and the Interpreter. These people are the only people who can see the Snarf leave. No one else can... or else it wont work or something.And the moral is that no one knows who they are. I'm serious.Anyways, the main bulk of the movie is Cleveland looking for people who can help, and being wrong a lot. And then he keeps stuttering. And it is annoying.This is definitely M. Night's worst directed movie. Many of the shots are out of focus and hurt your eyes. And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying. And there were a lot of unnecessary close ups.The writing is by far the worst in any movie. The Interpreter figures out what to do by looking at cereal boxes. I am not kidding. It hurt me inside when it happened.The acting was decent by many, but some of the people should not be actors. M. Night was pretty good, but his lines were kept at a minimum.Despite the absurdity of the Bed Time Story, every single person Cleveland told it to believed it immediately. And that is about 15 people. Just imagine someone telling you that a human that looks like everyone else... that doesn't even have gills, lives in the water. Nope, not happening.The only good thing I could find was the music... and only the last song. A few of the other songs were out of place and unnecessary. But the song during the climax was very well composed.M. Night should, in my opinion, stop directing and maybe pick up a different hobby. Like not directing. Or writing.Overview: This movie is in my top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. I laughed at how absurd the story was, but never laughed at the so-called 'funny parts.' Do not see this movie unless you like pain.Final grade: 3/1000",Lady in the Water
348,escapeN2flixtion,The Film That Started Shyamalan's Nosedive,1,25 May 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan was once a promising director. His first few films were so good. Many critics described him as a ""visionary"" and a ""true artist."" But over the years his reputation was sullied to the point where merely speaking his name was enough to repel viewers from the theater. What happened? Well, Lady in the Water happened. Before this film, even Shyamalan's poorer efforts had their share of admirers; after this, he was little more than a joke, and a favorite target for derision amongst critics and audiences. This was the film that derailed the once-great director, and unfortunately, neither his career nor his craft ever fully recovered.The story centers on a water nymph who shows up in an apartment pool one evening, and the tenants' attempts to help her find her way home. The film is supposedly based on bedtime stories that Shyamalan invented for his kids. Nothing wrong with that; I seem to recall the Hobbit was based on stories Tolkien made up for his children. But while the Hobbit turned out to be a well-rounded tale, Lady in the Water is a fractured, unstructured mess. It really feels like Shyamalan is making the story up as he goes. He establishes that the Scrunt, a sort of fairy-wolf monster, is hunting the nymph. But don't worry; he won't attack her now because the Tartutic, three monkey rulekeepers, have forbidden it. But wait! The Scrunt attacks anyway. It turns out the nymph is actually a queen nymph, and queen nymphs are so important that Scrunts WILL break the rules to kill them. So now the nymph needs a whole bunch of new characters to help her - they need to find a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer. When did this ""bedtime story"" become a game of Dungeons & Dragons? These new ""reveals"" about evil monkeys and Symbolists feel tacked on, and don't really justify their own presence. The Healer and Guardian are the only ones who seem to do anything; the others could've been removed. I'm guessing that M. Night's bedtime stories weren't quite deep enough to justify a feature-length movie, so he embellished them by shoving in a bunch of additional details, none of which add any real weight to the flimsy narrative. Maybe this would've worked better as a short story?The film as a whole is too grim. Shyamalan loves slow-burning films with lots of atmosphere, and I do too, but this one is way too dour. Every character seems to be in constant misery. This may be the fault of the actors, none of whom seem to be enjoying themselves. Performances are all-around lackluster. The nymph herself strikes me as a tad haughty; the other tenants risk their lives repeatedly for her sake (one of them even dies), but she rarely seems to give them any consideration in return. You don't really care about any of these characters at any point in the tale.Then there's Shyamalan's character. Talk about self-indulgence. He plays a writer whom the nymph prophesies will be martyred for writing a controversial book that will revolutionize the world. Add to this the character of the film critic, who lives in the complex, wants nothing to do with the nymph, is written to look selfish and unsympathetic, and meets a bizarre and violent death when he is attacked by the Scrunt, and this film really comes across as Shyamalan's whiny attempt to extol himself and demonize his detractors. It's comically ironic to look back on this now: despite casting himself as a revolutionary whose writings would benefit the human race, in real life his writing quality steadily grew worse with each new film. Ha ha.This is one of those movies that really has nothing to offer. The characters are bland, the performances uninspiring, the story unfocused, and the overall experience, in the end, forgettable. Even the CG is bad. Not that Shyamalan's special effects have ever been top-notch: the alien in Signs didn't look that great, but the director at least had the sense to keep the alien mostly hidden in the shadows. Here the Scrunt and the Tartutic are on screen in full glory, and man do they look bad. CG isn't the most important part of a movie, but when it looks THIS unfinished it can absolutely break the immersion.This film was one of the lowest points of Shyamalan's uneven career. While his later movies, like The Happening or Devil, were still bad, they were at least so bad they were funny. Lady in the Water can't even appeal on that level. It's just nothing - an hour-and-a-half-long yawn. Were it not for The Last Airbender, I'd call this the worst thing Shyamalan ever made. Even if you love his other work, you'll get nothing out of this. Watch it only if you'd like to see for yourself what caused Shyamalan to go from cinematic visionary to pariah. Otherwise, this is a film you should definitely avoid.",Lady in the Water
349,rmssw,Shyamalan missed his chance at redemption,4,21 July 2006,"I am a huge fan of Signs and The Sixth Sense. I think M. Night Shyamalan did amazing work with the horror genre in both films. He breathed new life into a dying breed of movie, giving them something new among all of the cliché-ridden movies that share the genre.So, I really wanted to like this movie. I, along with pretty much everyone else, was very disappointed by The Village and I very much wanted the director to redeem himself. He failed. Miserabley. Now, I could see his intentions throughout the entire movie. I knew what he was going for and really, it could have worked very well if it had been done correctly. The biggest problem I saw was that he tried to make it be too many different things at once. It was part fairy tale, part horror, part comedy, part fantasy...it goes on. If he had chosen just one and focused his efforts on it, I think the movie would have been very good. Instead, it ended up being a long-winded, pretentious, illogical mess.The movie is self-aware in some ways, often mocking itself and its own ridiculous story and explanations. This works in other movies, like Scream, for example. In this one, though, the subject is so outlandish that even the prodding the movie gives itself can't make it forgivable. You have to buy into a lot of insane stuff before you can even begin to get sucked into the story. In some movies, such a leap of faith is easy to make and the movie is thoroughly entertaining. Not many people question the rationality of Star Wars because the movies make their universe believable. Lady In The Water's universe is so confusing and muddled that it's distracting and the viewer spends more time calling it out than getting involved.There are times when I found myself laughing and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to or not. The scenes play out as completely serious, but it's hard to believe that anyone could have written such scenes and intended them to be taken seriously. It's impossible not to laugh at dialog that includes creatures such as narfs and scrunts.Ultimately, I would call the movie confusing. It doesn't know what it's supposed to be, so the audience is left even more clueless.",Lady in the Water
350,Stevebuerk,Myth and boredom,2,1 December 2006,"This movie does the worst thing a movie can do: it is boring. And the reason for this is very easy to see - the rules for any mystery were completely ignored. The movie starts with an explanation of the myth, that we are going to see and every step in the movie is explained in advance.I have given two points because of the good Performance of Paul Giamatti. He has the hard task of giving life to a character that stands out in a group that can only be explained as human shells. Hollow.The strangest things happen in front of their eyes and they react as if it would be normal to find out, that a myth is reality. ""Hi, this is a fairy (of narv or whatever)! You are chosen to help her!"" ""Oh, really? How nice. Glad to be of service."" Wouldn't it be much more interesting, if people reacted with the whole human spectrum of emotions? I will only comment very shortly on the role Mr Night Shyamalan has created for himself, because it speaks for itself: He is the writer, whose vision will one day change the face of the earth.I think it is a good idea to bring myth into the movies, but this movie fails because, in my opinion, it lacks the most basic tools of storytelling.",Lady in the Water
351,nop_inc,Wait What?,8,2 April 2007,"The only movie that M. Night Shyamalan has made, that I liked was Unbreakable. Before Lady in the Water that, I think, was his peak in the movie business. With this movie, I think he has done his best. The writing, acting, overall emotion in this movie are top notch. A lot of the random shots he places kind of threw me out of the movie, but it was easy to get back into it. The highlight of the film is Giamatti, his emotion made me care about his character along with Story (Bryce Dallas Howard).Shyamalan has gotten so much better at writing with this film. Before I watched this I would rather watch a worm farm than see one of his films, but this movie has changed my mind about him entirely. 8/10.",Lady in the Water
352,Mudsharkbytes,How The Mighty Have Fallen,2,31 July 2006,"It is difficult to imagine that the same filmmaker who displayed such outstanding vision and sensitivity in ""The Sixth Sense"" was responsible for this silly, turgid waste of two hours.Many people seem enamored with this so-called fairy tale, but nowhere in the plodding monotone of a plot did I discover any semblance of believability, crucial when dealing with the fantasy genre. Even fairy tales must have some sort of internal logic or they are just nonsensical.What have we here? Heep, discovers a Nerf in his pool. Not understanding the purpose of the Nerf, Heep luckily (conveniently) discovers one of his tenants is well versed in fairy tales that deal with wet Nerfs. Turns out the Nerf has to deliver a message to a prophetic writer (Shyamalan, natch), said message being that he will change the world with his brilliant writing - uh huh... Meanwhile, a grassy Shrek wants to put the bite on the Nerf before Big BIrd can swoop down to take it home. Turns out the Nerf is no ordinary Nerf, but more like a Super-Nerf Blaster. Shreks hate Super-Nerf Blasters so much that they will break long establish fairy-tale Shrek rules to put the chomp on 'em. Luckily Heeps tenement building is full of people with very little credulity so he is able to enlist their aid without the annoying plot inconvenience of trying to convince them any of this is true. Luckily too, a convenient Smurf is able to read prophesy from cereal boxes on the pantry shelf, and puts everybody straight. It turns out that Shreks like to chomp down on party-pooping film critics too (Bob Balaban, playing the most likable character in the movie), especially film critics that can't appreciate the originality and genius that is Shyamalan by espousing the view that nothing new can be done in movies anymore (or some such, I paraphrase). Thus the only character in this opus that behaves reasonably normal is quickly dispatched. Eventually, a half- bodybuilder stares down the Shrek until the Deus Ex Machina in the trees manages to dispatch the noisome beasty, allowing the Nerf to catch a ride with Big Bird while everybody gazes skyward looking like one of those black velvet paintings of kids & puppies with the really big eyes.Give me a break.Now, given the proper handling, this story could have been entertaining - a lighthearted animated film maybe, or directed by somebody with the sensibilities and taste of a Rob Reiner, or the wackiness of Mel Brooks. Anybody besides the ego-maniacal Shyamalan, who seems to favor turgidity, visual & audio monotony, ham-handed acting, and more downright gag-me moments that make you want to run to the lobby and demand a refund than any movie since... well any movie I have ever seen!How the mighty have fallen.The only way this wet turkey could be entertaining would be to enlist the services of Crow and Tom Servo.Two out of ten, and only because Shyamalan finally broke free of the 'gotta have a twist at the end' rut. Hmmm... maybe that wasn't such a bad rut after all.",Lady in the Water
353,kyle-florence,"Well directed, well acted, but still falls short",5,27 July 2006,"I saw this film the day it came out and I didn't go in there with high expectations. The film started out wonderfully, the acting was on-par, the cinematography was great and you even felt compelled by the story. However, that said, you soon lose interest in the story-line.The overall idea of the film was fairly good. It's purely fantasy, so you'd have to forgive a lot of stuff and not look too deeply into it, but if you can look past that it had promise. Unfortunately the story was very poorly developed. What (I'm guessing) M. Night intended to be a series of interweaving themes in the movie turned into one big jumbled mess. You couldn't tell where he was going with stuff half the time, he would drag out meaningless sections of the film and throw in humor and horror at random. He threw so many twists into the film that by the end you could easily guess what would happen next, it was almost an insult to the viewer to think they are that gullible. If the film was meant to be a serious suspense there were many scenes that should've been changed or left out. So all-in-all I feel the script has failed the film. What we could've seen as a well shot piece of art was ruined by the constant interruption of poor scripting.Asside from the story-line, the film was very well acted. Paul Giamatti pulls through as always delivering a great performance as Cleveland Hepp, the bumbling landlord of the apartment complex. Bryce Dallas Howard does well for the most part as Story, the ""narf"" from the Blue World, although you tend to get bored of her by the end of the film. M. Night as an actor seemed sort of out of place, he made the scenes feel awkward, I would've cast someone else in the role (not to mention this draws attention away from more important aspects of the film and leaves you wondering if M. Night is getting full of himself). Many of the side-roles made this film somewhat bearable, such as Jeffrey Wright as Mr. Dury (the one armed body builder) and Bob Balaban as Mr. Farber (the local movie critic).To sum it up, if you look at this film purely as a piece of art, it was very well shot, acted, and directed.

He produces yet another stand alone story that makes you wander what his kids dream about at ""night"". Like his other movies, this film, although the pivotal character is not human, emphasizes the importance of overcoming your own self doubt realizing that love is a key tool to hurdling life's obstacles that we, ourselves, put before us.Like a chess game, Night moves his pieces (characters) in a playful game of ""who am I and how do I contribute to the story?"". From Building-Maintenance-Guy to Weirdo-Wight-Lifting-Attendant, each character discovers within him or her their importance in a pivotal moment in mankind's history. Who would have thought that all this orbits around a mystical Lady in some Water?! The underlying theme is that believing in yourself is the key ingredient to working real life miracles. Don't ever give up hope! Also, there is a lot of enjoyable humor. This is not a horror. This quite in fact, a bed time story. There's even a book for kids written by M. Night Shyamalan based on the movie. (or vise-versa) I enjoyed the story very much, due to it's originality and clever acting.

Saying this film is flawless is absolutely the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a long time! I honestly had high hopes for LITW. I had heard it was horrible, but I felt it unfair to the movie to prejudge without any real background information about it. Hey, at least I gave it a try.The main point-Shyamalan needs to stick with what he's best at: the semi-creepy thrillers most've come to know and love. LITW was SUCH a failure, although I did have fairly good expectations due to what I've seen earlier, like Signs and The Village, all decent flicks. But LITW failed to bring anything whatsoever, no interesting surprise endings, strongly intense scenes, or good acting on behalf of Bryce Dallas Howard. The story was just stupid, and it wasn't anywhere near cut-out and developed enough to become a major motion picture. It needed lots of work before it was even considered to become a film.It was difficult to follow, partly because little things were just thrown in here and there just so the story could continue with some sense of any logic. Nothing was very well explained, leaving the viewer just barely holding onto the weak concept and storyline of the movie.Hopefully Shyamalan will pull a better plot out of his head for his next production. I've really enjoyed his past films, mainly because they leave you thinking about the movie and really getting a great thought process going. However, with LITW, one, and only one thought came to mind: ""DUMB."" By the way, I do think I've been exceptionally nice with the rating I've Given (4/10).

I didn't really have any good expectations of this movie but when I saw it I was dumbfounded. This movie had its trailer played constantly and it made it look like a thriller, which I knew not to expect a thriller after the same thing happened with The Village (also crap), but it turned out to be some kind of modern day fairy tale story, and failed miserably.The people in this movie made no sense at all. The Narf, or whatever she was, was injured badly and all that happened was about twelve adults stood and stared at her trying to figure out what to do. CALL 911! Some guy slightly suggests to get her to a hospital but everyone looks at him like he's stupid and they completely ignore his advice. And some kid can read a prophecy from cereal boxes, give me a break.The one thing that really made this movie bad for me is that it put me to sleep.

The story is interesting and different. I felt really involved with the characters. I even got chills at one point. There is something inspiring about the story. Paul Giamatti is outstanding. Bryce Dallas Howard is beautiful and ethereal. I enjoyed the twists and turns and the way Paul Giamatti's character tried to figure out how to help the girl. The whole cast is wonderful. The director's appearance in the film was not distracting to me, as it seemed to be to the film critics. I thought he did a fine job. I remain very impressed with his ability to create these films. Of course the greatest film he has done, in my opinion, is The Sixth Sense. I think it's one of the best films I've ever seen. I think Lady in the Water is my second favorite of his films.",Lady in the Water

364,ghostofmrpalmer,"Not a great movie, but certainly not as bad as you've heard",7,19 June 2008,"To start off with, I actually liked this movie, and at first I couldn't understand why some many people hated, but upon reflection i can see what some people reacted to so harshly.One thing I liked about the film is the simple story, or more accurately, the atmosphere. M. Night has always been better at creating a mood than fleshing out a story, but the premise of Lady in the Water works for me: It about people reacting to a fairy tale happening in real life. This concept probably put a lot of people off, the fact of the matter is this concept hasn't been used a lot (but it has been done before, i.e. Peter Weir's ""The Last Wave"", a deeper and more philosophical film), and people aren't used to it. Like I said, I liked it, but most of my friends thought it was stupid.The main thing that people hated was M. Night's own acting in the film, and on this I agree. He was without a doubt the worst thing in the film. It was a disgusting example of self-indulgence and self-importance, and more than that, he's just a terrible actor and he should stop.The one thing that I really had a hard time stomaching was the extended sequences with the party band, Silvertide. They were so awful I wanted to walk out of the movie. Picture a blonde version of The Black Crows with even less talent ripping through and f*(^king up a version of Dylan's ""Maggie's farm"".Those few things aside, the rest of the cast was great, I thought the story was simple and decent enough, the ""film critic"" part with Bob Balaban was funny, but M. Night was asking for it with that one, and the movie as a whole was entertaining.M. Night started out as the new golden boy of Hollywood with ""The Sixth Sense"", but many have felt he's lost his touch. The truth is he hasn't lost his touch, he just hasn't grown as a director. With ""The 6th Sense"", ""Unbreakable"", ""Signs"", ""The Village"", and now ""The Happening"", he keep tilling the same field. it's getting old. ""The 6th Sense"" was great, mostly because it was fresh, ""Unbreakable"" was entertaining for me at least due to the comic book references, but ""Signs"", ""The Happening"", and especially ""The Village"" were just plain terrible. ""Lady In The Water"" was a nice diversion from his formula, but it's getting tired. Perhaps M. Night would benefit from directing a script written by someone else, and not built around some moronic ""twist"" at the end, and most definitely not acting in it.",Lady in the Water

However, Shyamalan is wonderfully creative and imaginative, and I did enjoy the myth aside from the deus ex machina ending. It's also funny at parts, especially in regard to Bob Balaban's character, and holds your interest especially when Paul Giamatti runs around interacting with the various tenants. Perhaps if there were more of this personal drama and interaction rather than Shyamalan's grandiose metaphor of ""Story"" and self-vindication as a writer (he appears as a writer in this film, basically as himself), this would be a better product. Still, it was enjoyable despite being problematic, and those Scruts are sure scary!",Lady in the Water

367,swusterb,"Entrancing Film, Very Well-Acted",9,22 July 2006,"I was entranced by this film. It is very stylishly directed and very well-acted. Each actor was chosen perfectly and did their full duty.The direction is very up close, giving the film a nearly claustrophobic feeling, which I believe helps to give the film the credibility it needs for the story to unfold. We accept the motivations and actions of the characters because we feel so close to them. We feel their individuality and are in tune with them.Paul Giamatti is perfectly chosen for this film. He carries the film extremely well, keeping it moving forward by his simple acceptance of the strange events unfolding. I can't imagine any other actor carrying the film as well.Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderful as the nymph. She makes it clear that the character is just about just as confused as the others in the apartment complex.There are humorous events perfectly placed in the film to give a bit of lightness that adds to the momentum of events, but the real winner is the creature causing all the ruckus. The effects of making it as real as possible were very well done.The supporting characters are a perfect ensemble, adding to the realism of the film. In fact, that's what makes the film work so well: it is a fantasy taking place in the realm of reality so that it becomes believable. Through it, we are able to discern messages or themes of hope, desperation, love, hate, happiness, melancholy, etc. There are many possible interpretations. I'd say it depends on what you're going through. The movie speaks to many moods.I understand that M. Night Shyamalan went through a lot to get this film made. I believe it was worth every effort he put into it.",Lady in the Water
368,haquenin,I'm a movie lover and I try to see something positive in every movie I see,1,24 June 2007,"In Lady In The Water, however, I don't see much.I have to say that I'm not a fan of Shyamalan's films. I think he's a fine director, but an absolutely terrible storyteller. I think the number one thing that a storyteller owes his audience, even before establishing a storyline with central conflict, before conceiving his characters and their motivations, a storyteller must establish a world that is consistent unto itself in which to stage the action.I had problems in that regard with the Sixth Sense. I had a feeling that I was being manipulated from the very beginning because Bruce Willis chose not to even question why his wife didn't pay attention to him or people in general would ignore him. At least once, I would have thought, if Willis had the genuine belief that he was alive, he would have come up to someone and tried to grab them and ask them why they were ignoring him. I have a feeling it was a manipulative gimmick just so that Bruce Willis could have a sudden revelation at the end that he was actually dead.Signs disappointed me in the same way. The aliens simply weren't believable and Shyamalan never drew me into the special world of his movie, as there were no coherent rules. I cannot believe that an alien race would come millions of light years to planet earth and communicate with each other by tiny crop circles barely visible from a thousand miles up instead of through high tech communication systems. And how is it that incredibly advanced aliens would choose to fight humans on the ground in bare hand-to-hand combat against knives and baseball bats? These elements are important in a movie in getting the audience to suspend belief and believe in the special world in which the characters live. All along, I felt that the world of Signs was contrived and that aliens were coming along to fight without weapons just so that Joaquin Phoenix could rediscover his self-worth by swinging a baseball bat and Mel Gibson could regain his faith.Similarly, the world of Lady In The Lake never draws the audience into the special world of the rules of the movie to suspend belief. At all times, I'm aware that Shyamalan is on the other side sitting in a director's chair yelling ""action"" and ""cut"" and that the characters are actors waiting to get a paycheck. There are no Korean bedtime stories involving narfs and scrunts and the like. Bedtime stories don't require a rule book to make sense. I saw no point to the story and its complex rules and came away saying ""so what"". In Harry Potter, the rules reveal themselves through the ACTION of the story. Here, dialog and questions revealed the rules, which is bad storytelling. Also, I saw no connection between the main character and the Lady In The Water. She just sat throughout the movie, dripping water and barely moving. I saw no exchange of emotion with the main character and therefore I saw no motivation in him as to why he would risk his life to save her. Again, I think Shyamalan is building a contrived world that never lets you believe in it but instead exists just so an important moment near the end of the film can give the hero a reason to feel redemption of some sort. To me this is the opposite of storytelling as there is no story, no motivation, no building of tension, no heightening conflict or adversity, just an internal and private climax for the main character.The only positive thing I can say about this film and for which I gave it 1 point is in the monster. I thought the idea of a giant dog or wolf (or whatever it is) that has grass growing on its back and that can flatten itself and hide in the lawn is clever and imaginative.",Lady in the Water
369,rrogers2-1,Dead in the Water,2,2 October 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan owes me $48.75 and an explanation. The Sixth Sense surprised us all but rewatch it. It lies its ass off. It cheats to make you think that Bruce Willis is alive. Candlelight dinners with the wife, visiting with his star patient's mother before a session, these are all activities that a very much ALIVE child psychiatrist would do. But no, he's dead. If you liked that movie then you should go make friends at a prison because apparently bold-faced, shameless lies are cool to you.Signs, while it has a couple chilling moments am I really to believe that Mel Gibson's daughter has to be freakishly obsessive-compulsive (the hundreds of glasses of water), his son has to have crippling asthma, his brother has to have a miserable baseball career, his wife has to die in a horrible car accident AND aliens have to invade the Earth just so he can get his faith back? You're a wily one M. Night.Then The Village, this movie could have been cool but wasn't. M. Night cops out because he couldn't come up with an interesting ending. And, this has vexed me since I saw it, if these people did start a simple society then why did they feel the need to speak as if they were from the 1800's? Oh wait, it was a cheap device M. Night used to trick us, again.Barring Unbreakable (that's a sweet movie) I'm noticing a trend. Yes, M. Night Shyamalan's movies suck but Mr. Shyamalan has created his own brand of sucking and Lady in the Water is the crowning achievement.M. Night Shyamalan has become synonymous with crap movies just as Kleenex means quality tissues or just as ipod means I'm hip to the jive no matter how many gigs I got. And this is by M. Night's choice. The first credit at the end of the film reads in Times New Ego ""Directed, Produced and Written by M. Night Shyamalan."" Not to mention he plays a major role in the movie (as a character whose writing is so important that it changes the course of history). It is no accident that the previews say M. Night Shyamalan's, Lady in the Water or Signs or Infuriating Piece of Crap.Lady in the Water is the tale of Cleveland (Paul Giamatti), a lovable apartment manager that stumbles into a world of fantasy when a water nymph appears in the pool. Through some hare-brained explanations, that I will spare you 1. because they are boring 2. in case you want to waste $10 at the theatre, we learn of a world full of scrunts, narfs and other nonsense words.Paul Giamatti delivers a particularly weak performance but I don't blame him. Acting in something like this can only be so good. Giamatti's character is nervous for some unknown reason and suffers from a severe stutter. So severe that is sounds 100% phony. It sounds like a cartoon automobile struggling to turn over, puh-puh-puh-puh.But where Shyamalan really shines is with the supporting cast. You see, Cleveland manages an apartment building with Z@NY! characters everywhere. Man, what an eccentric group of people! Of course all of the eccentricities come back into play when we least expect it (or exactly when you expect it, depends if you have half a brain or are over the age of 8) It is so transparent that it is sickening. It fits together so perfectly that it feels cheap. Like a porn star.In the most brutal scene in the film a snot-nosed film critic tries to make a funny, breaking-down-the-fourth-wall analysis of his predicament. You know the ""this is the part in a scary movie when X, Y and Z"" bit. It is painful to watch and Scream already played that game. For shame M. Night. You got me this time and you'll see me next time. Only then you'll owe me another $9.75.",Lady in the Water
370,a-laly,Lady in the Lake should have been drowned,2,29 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan lost his muse soon after the huge success of his widely acclaimed The Sixth Sense. The man is a one trick pony and keeps hounding his effete subconscious into pumping up his creative juices around the ""other"" world. He should leave it well alone and diversify his story telling craft. There is enough reality around that is stranger than fiction. Lady of the Lake is truly bad in many departments. I am surprised that Christopher Doyle offers up such bad cinematography, this from a man who has mesmerized audiences with his visual genius in Asian films. Shyamalan should seriously think about not putting himself in front of the camera ever again. None of the characters ever take traction. Giammati's role as manager of an apartment building that boasts ethnic diversity, is as flat as the pancake he would never eat. Sarita Chaudhry has a few good lines but that is about all the humor you will get in this entirely tiresome movie. Why was this movie ever made? It's too bad that Shyamalan is running his credit as a good storyteller into the ground.",Lady in the Water
371,cyrilvc,Another Shyamalam Dream brought to Life,10,30 July 2006,"Please don't go by the reviews the big times critics are blabbering on and on. Go with an open mind to expect anything. It is a typical Shayamalan flick. Considering it's just a bedtime story that he used to tell his kids, imagine the kind of stuff this man can come up with!! It's a brilliant tale if are willing to believe the story without questioning it on the logics.Shyalmalan movies always have a message and his take on every genre of movie. In this case, its bedtime stories which was way different from what a Disney movie would ever be. He was trying to say how important it is to believe in yourself and help yourself achieve what you are capable of. No matter what you go through. You always have to be willing to take the second chance even if it may seems highly unlikely and totally offbeat or out of character. Though you may think that there are some people who would be the last people you goto. You never know who comes in handy at any point of your life. The best part of the movie is, he doesn't really give you a proper tale in the way it is obvious enough for everyone to understand. He leaves gaps in the movie, which tends to be a little confusing. That in a way is like reading any novel in which it's up to you to imagine and see things for yourself and assume things for yourself. I am a big fan of Shyamalan and he surely kept me on the edge of the seat the whole time. Amazingly, it has its light moments too.The idea of a guy experimenting with himself by being different and exercising only one half of the body is truly a funny thought. The way in which he ""brought down"" the movie critic was hilarious. He is surely taking the fight to them. I just wish his creativity is not deterred with the ""not so great"" show with the audience. He sure is the wind of change in Hollywood. I recommend this movie for everyone to see. If you just want to see a truly different vision of thought you must try this one. I would love to buy the DVD with the extra features :)",Lady in the Water

374,directorstouch,A Beautifully Woven Tale,8,10 May 2007,"First, I will say that I can see why many folks didn't enjoy this movie. M. Night Shyamalan has a style all his own. I remember when the trailer for 'The Village' came out and it sold the movie as a horror flick, which it wasn't at all. The trailer for this movie was equally as enigmatic and I really didn't know what to expect.Night's directing style is very subtle and he tells a story very gradually and softly, like a person reading a bedtime story would. It is not a horror flick, or even an action film. The magic is in the story.Before I get into the story, I will say that James Newton Howard's score for this movie is truly epic. The climax of the film is colored with a musical score Howard Shore would be proud of.The story is quite simple. In a lovely prologue that impresses on us just how ancient the act of storytelling is, we are told a story about make-believe creatures called Narfs who are protected by giant eagles. there is so much more, but that's the very bare bones.Then we meet one of the most charming ensemble casts I have seen in a long time. An apartment complex filled with eccentric folks, each with a slight oddity that sets them apart from the rest of the world. Throughout the movie, each person becomes an important player in this fairy tale that unfolds.This is where we must suspend disbelief for a time. One of these Narfs, named Story, ends up in the pool, hiding from beasts that are searching for her. She meets the landlord and asks for his help in returning her to her world (the Blue World).One thing I really respect about Night is that he doesn't rely on CGI. There is one creature, a giant eagle that is computer generated and some various shots of other things that may be CGI, but all the creatures are either animatronic (even a wolf-like-creature that runs through the grass is a moving, remote controlled creature) or elaborate costumes, which is astonishing because they are so real and in the hands of any other director would be unconvincing, but Night handles them beautifully.The tone of the movie is constantly shifting. After a somber prologue, we are thrown into a humorous scene involving a Hispanic family, a broom and a very large bug. Night keeps you on your toes constantly.Some have criticized Night for appearing in his own film. I see nothing wrong with that. When Kenneth Branagh directed an uncut, 3 and a half hour version of 'Hamlet' and cast himself in the lead role, it worked perfectly. If you're looking for a scary film, this isn't it. It could more be considered an art film, a film that looks, not at storybook characters, but people. just like Signs (which was about a family dealing with loss, not aliens), this film is about people and that potential that all people have.I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone who still has a passion for fairy tales.",Lady in the Water
375,FlyingZombo,I liked it. So Sue Me. *SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER ALERT *,8,22 July 2006,"I've been hearing a lot of negative feedback from critics about this movie. Truth is, I liked it a lot. I think the only reason critics didn't like it was because the film critic who's in the movie gets killed. I think M. Night Shyamalan finally learned that you don't need to put twists at the end of all of your movies to make them good. Hell, after ""The Village"" that method just stopped working for him completely. That was all he was starting to become known for, not for the fact that he was actually a GOOD storyteller. This was a GOOD story that he tells, and I really enjoyed it. It was interesting, and it was even somewhat intense at points. With this one, he doesn't try to scare the audience, nor do I think the audience gets scared. I'm really glad that he's started to realize that, while most of his thrillers were good (with one already mentioned exception), he was getting too repetitive. Once again, as is the case with pretty much all of his movies, it was visually very good. All this negative feedback around the movie was because it wasn't what the critics expected it to be. Those going to the movie expecting to be scared, you will be disappointed. But those who now know not to expect the usual Shyamalan film, there's hope.

But that's not what this movie is supposed to be. The way the team members are discovered and then lost, they ridiculous specificity of the characters and their talents, the collapse of the ""regular"" plot, these and many more are designed to provide an obvious critique of how so many movies, shows, stories, etc all follow the same predictable yet unrealistic pattern. The hero finds his team with very little guidance. Everyone suddenly knows their role. The creatures' ridiculous names never fully make sense. Lady is intended to overplay all of these tropes as a critique of the industry's reliance on those tropes. In and of itself it's ridiculous. But taken as a critique of lazy writing, something that everyone seems to complain about these days, it's still goofy as hell, but an interesting and enjoyable ride.",Lady in the Water
377,kvinneslandr,"A strong 7, a lot more depth and heart than many reviewers are giving it credit for.",7,8 June 2008,"Spoiler warning: I can see why many people would not think much of this movie. There were many instances where tying seemingly unrelated or insignificant details together got a bit sloppy, unlike all of his previous movies (and I always felt this was MNS's major skill).For example, I was convinced the half-muscle guy was going to play the role of the guardian, but there should have been some greater tie-in on why half of his body needed to be super strong (I envisioned him holding the beast by the scruff of the neck with his strong arm while his 'normally-developed' half did something else necessary for the scene to be believable... instead, all he did was stare and then nearly messed up even that simple task). Also, the young son of the puzzle guy suddenly being the Translator by being able to read symbolic meanings from a wall of cereal boxes was too conveniently deus ex machina, although I can see what MNS was trying to do there, and many fond memories of childhood for us all did indeed entail the morning breakfast study of the cereal boxes in front of us as we ate from our bowls.But compare that with how clever the 'by listening to the critic we were steered wrong' theme turned out to be... which was a nice twist because everything up to that point seemed reasonable and logical, as far as the critic's advice went... it's a well-known pitfall to judge everything by its cover, or to miss important aspects of life by viewing everything strictly from our own stereotyped experiences, no matter how true they might be MOST of the time... I seem to recall a maxim along the lines of ""If you judge things and make your decisions only by what you've seen happen before, you'll be right most of the time, but when you're wrong, you'll be tragically wrong"" or something to that effect.Or how about the 'twist' of Giamatti being, not the Guardian, but the Healer (I call it a twist because by that time I had forgotten that he used to be doctor), the man who himself was in such need of healing, and because of his deep, deep grief being able to spiritually transfer that depth of feeling into saving the Angel, who in fact really wound up saving him, in the end ('thank you for giving me back my life' is how I believe he ended the movie). That's heavy stuff, and extremely moving, especially to those of us who are older and have children of our own.I don't mind MNS's overt bash at critics or the egocentric casting as writer-whose-ideas-will-change-the-world stuff... I don't judge the movie based upon the director's personal life or motives... in fact, I thought the writer was very human and without the hubris that many here are accusing him of having as a director for playing that role himself... furthermore, I think Giamatti was playing a sort of John The Baptist role (unlike a previous poster who likened the writer to John The Baptist), because the writer himself will become a martyr.All in all, if this movie is a failure, then it's a noble one. The fact that MNS tried something different, and it wasn't quite the same calibre as his previous work, is no reason to dismiss TLIW lightly.In fact, I think the movie's reputation will grow as time goes on.",Lady in the Water

And ""Lady in the Water"" is a significant mark in his legacy.Now to the opinionated part of my review.""Lady in the Water"" might be Shyamalan's best besides ""The Sixth Sense"". It definitely beat ""Signs"" for me. Possibly ""The Village"" too. Regrettably, ""Lady"" had a very stupid advertising campaign. Especially the one with the whispering child, singing ""Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?"" As if America couldn't expect all of M. Night's work to be scary, that or hate it, enough!

And use it for the better.As M. Night fans already know, in each film, Night has a little cameo. Signs would be his biggest as the role of Ray Reddy, the man who accidentally killed Mel Gibson's character's wife. But in ""Lady"", Shyamalan takes on his biggest role yet as Vic, the writer whose book would change America. He's as great an actor as a director, with a spot-on performance.The scene where Mr. Ferber gets killed by the scrunt is the greatest scene Night has written and directed yet. The monologue of how situations like that would take place in films was amazing and funny! I think Night was kind of criticizing critics and the predictability of American cinema all in one.Speaking of scrunts, the special effects in this film were really good. Despite M.

His character's name is Cleveland Heep. (Cleveland means a place of high cliffs or precipices (the apartment complex here)...and Heep refers to Uriah Heep from Dickens' David Copperfield. Uriah, early in Dickens' tale, was one who did anything for anyone, a servant, a toady, a shy yet hurt man with something very sad in his past.) Briefly: Cleveland Heep is a servant of sorts, a maintenance man. He is burdened by the loss of his family and his inability to express grief. The power of the memories of a story that he once knew (that we all once knew in one form or another), brought back to mind by the allegorical insights and help of those near him, allows him to reassemble the power stories can have. Thus Cleveland is able to release his guilt, his overwhelming sadness, his sense of loss...and regain personal comfort, happiness, thankfulness and a sense of purpose. The two key scenes in the film are when Story find Cleveland's diary, and then when he reclines on the couch -- lowering himself ever so slowly as he returns to the shelter of a ""remembered"" warm bed to hear his ""remembered' story once again.The other characters in the film represent the elements of the story he (we) knew/know. Scary monsters, happy friends, grownups we can't understand, grownups we love, silly situations, jokes we don't get as kids, jokes we still don't comprehend, dialog that sounds like code...and the try-and-try-again effort story characters go through to reach a happy ending.This is a powerful and essential film, the best yet from this writer/director. It points directly to Cleveland Heep's personal demons (and ours), and how --story-- can help lift the weights age and self doubt bring to every person.",Lady in the Water
382,LittleGirlLost,Charming and magical bedtime story,6,14 September 2006,"I don't understand all the criticism M. Night Shyamalan has gotten after ""The Sixth Sense"". So what if he has gone astray from the ultimate thriller, and is trying new kinds of mixed genres...?! What I admire the most about Shyamalan is his narrative joy, his unique stories and originality. His movies are exiting and fresh in Hollywoods predictive mainstream and re-make universe...!! If you know that ""Lady in the Water"" is developed with basis in Shyamalans bedtime stories for his 2 children, it's a wonderful piece of work! Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard are clearly the right choices for the two leads. Bryce is perfect as Story, and she seems vulnerable and graceful and ""out-of-this-world""... Paul does a good and convincing role as the lonely yet hopeful Cleveland, carrying around a tragic and overriding family-secret. Shyamalan manages to create a new world in this movie, a magical universe where everything and everyone has a purpose. If I was to criticize anything here, it would be that they could have done the creatures a little bit more ""realistic"" (in the sense that fable creatures from other worlds actually exist...) instead of the obvious digital work... All-in-all I liked the movie. It's a cute fairy-tale story that has an underlying message to all of us. Don't give up on life... we all have a purpose... and we can all make a difference!",Lady in the Water
383,amamistyed,The Night is young,10,23 July 2006,"I heard a lot of bad things about this movie so I was kind of worried...I don't want to see M. Night Shyamalan fail. Tonight I saw it. Now I don't know how to condense the expression of my thorough appreciation of it.A gentle man who has a mundane job as care taker of an apartment building encounters a mystical Narf in the swimming pool who has been delivered from the Blue World to this world to change the future for us all through the writings of one man. And, in the process, many of the people in the apartment building need to get together - bind around a common goal - and save the Narf to allow her to be returned to her world where she can fulfill her purpose and lead her people.This is a bedtime story. It really is. But you have to have the eyes of Cleaveland Heep to see it that way. Or the heart of Vick Ran. Or the desire to love life like Young-Soon Choi.And it is a real life drama with depth and meaning in every space. But you have to listen to the dialog and look into the individual apartments and see the images on their televisions and listen to the different music coming from them...and become part of The Cove.But most of all you have to let yourself go and allow yourself to feel these characters. Each one makes it easy for you if you are willing. Paul Giamatti is exquisite as Cleveland Heep and gives an Oscar winning performance throughout - especially in one of the last scenes of this unique and awesome movie. M. Night Shyamalan as Vick Ran was perfect. His credibility as an actor is sealed in my mind. He made me think, and cry and hope I could find such nobility in myself if it came to it. Cindy Cheung is delightful in her part as she exudes life and expectation. Each cast member should have something special said about them. They were real. They were great. Dallas Howard is beautiful as Story...and subtly played as she should have because the story while focused around her isn't really about her. Its about them. The other characters who she comes to help.M. Night Shyamalan is only 36 years old and he has already created at least 5 classic films. Each one is unique...each one has depth and purpose. I believe, like Vick Ran, Mr. Shyamalan has something to say...a lot to say. This is a man who cares about things...like humility and honesty and tolerance; and is an artist. He uses actors who are artists. He uses the camera like a an artist's paint brush and the world in front of him is his palette. Somehow...no matter how you think you are going to feel when you begin watching his movies...at the end there is something in your heart...a smile on your face...thoughts in your mind...feelings you didn't expect to feel...and they are good. Exceptionally good. And M. has just got started.",Lady in the Water
384,klbowersox,That was no lady that was a Narf.,1,28 July 2006,"I have been pulling for M. Night Shyamalan as he has bravely battled his ego all of these years. I loved The Sixth Sense. I found Unbreakable flawed but intriguing. I loved both Signs and The Village all the way up until their endings drove both of their plots to Dopeyville. In all of these I could see M. Night held a truly great talent, but also saw that no matter how talented anyone else thought he was, M. Night's opinion of his talent was immeasurably higher. In fact I have been expecting a day when he starts insisting that his name be followed by the phrase ""Super Genius"" like Wile E. Coyote back when he talked. (M. Night came dangerously close to that when he gave himself the largest screen credit in film history at the end of Signs.) Well something worse than that has happened, and that thing is Lady in the Water. I went to this expecting to be enthralled and intrigued for nearly all of its running length. Sure I knew there was a good chance that I would be grossly disappointed in the last five minutes, but even then I expected the bulk of the movie to make the disappointment worth it. Instead I got a ham-handed sledgehammer of an allegory filled with sub-par (for M. Night) cinematography, technical goofs (the boom mike operator should be fired), Ed Wood level dialog, a hackneyed inane story (Narfs? Scrunts? Dr. Seuss M. Night ain't) that seems to think it is treading new ground, and hollow characters. No mystery, no twists of any interest, none of that M. Night charm.The only really good performance was by the Lady herself. The rest seem to phone in their performances. Even M. Night himself. (Did anyone else find the dialog between he and his sister more creepy than humorous? Maybe it was because I expected him to fly into a violent rage at any moment, shouting ""You dare mock me!?"") I cannot fathom that some of these reviewers actually saw the same movie I saw. This was a pretentious, high-handed, naked emperor of a movie that had no idea what it was trying to do. You will definitely want to wait to see this one on DVD, and then just to mstie it.",Lady in the Water
385,billschweitzer,Overrated Film From An Overrated Writer/Director,3,22 October 2006,"""Lady In The Water"" seems to be little more than a poor excuse to stroke Shyamalan's own ego by writing himself into the script as a noble writer who's work will change the world so much that he becomes a martyr. The story seems like he's making things up as he goes along, with new rules and characters in the fairy tale surrounding the ""lady"" every ten minutes.Paul Giamatti did an outstanding job in making an absolutely terrible and pointless script watchable. He is an incredible talent, and certainly deserves to be recognized for his work. As for Shyamalan, he has always been hit and miss. His supporters will sing the praises of even the most average and ordinary of films (Signs, Unbreakable) as well as his heavily Rod Serling inspired movie twists (The Village, The Sixth Sense), but Lady In The Water falls under neither category. It is not average, nor does it have a twist of any kind, stolen or otherwise.With this film, Shyamalan attempted to create an ""ET"" for a new generation, and failed miserably. I would compare this film to unsatisfying sex , in that it feels like a lot of buildup with no release (or point) at the end. This film will be all but forgotten by this time next year.I would advise anyone to not bother wasting their time. This film falls flat on every level. When the credits came on screen in my theater, just about everyone in the crowd, including several children, looked around each other and said ""was that it?"" and ""what was the point?"". I am left wondering the same.",Lady in the Water

Touching morale",8,29 December 2006,"While this movie caught my attention by being falsely marketed as a seemingly-horror flick... thriller or whatnot, I did not feel tricked or betrayed by its content.Some will say it wasn't scary: But that's because it's not a horror, nor a thriller. Some will say the story is insane, but again, I beg to differ.The word is ""formidable"". Prehaps ""touching"" could also be added. While the story seems to unroll in a very unorthodox, disordered fashion along with more than a few mistakes, the viewer is brought into a child-like fantasy world, topped with a touching morale that many will fail to grasp! (most of these people will be bitter through the first 30 minutes over the fact that it is not a horror film and simply give up on the story's strange, unusual twists) See, this movie paints a message in big friendly fluffy letters: Although we are not told our purpose in life, we mean much, much more than we often give ourselves credit for.I almost got in the boat of bitter viewers after a while, but as the story became more complex, I began to trust where the film was taking me. Fortunately, this trust paid off.I have not felt like this since seeing the first Neverending Story! I was just a child back then. This one brought me way back. To any potential viewer: This is a fantastic fairytale that if followed carefully will make you think very deeply of who we are as one, and what you individually mean to this world.Also, it should be a feature of choice for the younger ones. It allows to dream, while keeping touch with reality.I was impressed by this work of art and hope the creator gets proper credit for it.",Lady in the Water

Bob Balaban's acting is excellent. the most absurd thing is the kid who interprets the message from the packs of cereal. could he be more absurd than that? what does the Chinese old lady want from bob Balaban? was she a child molester in her young days. she wanted to see a grownup man behaving like a child before she would tell him that stupid bed time story. i cant believe it that there could be an absurd film than this.",Lady in the Water
388,lynxspyder,Contrived and clumsy,3,22 January 2007,"The best stories create metaphor subtly and craftily. They lure you in with an engaging tale, forcing you to have a vested interest in the characters and the plot even as the metaphor is being crafted from the components within.Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" is the most contrived and egocentric work I think I've ever witnessed. Who would have the arrogance and audacity to cast himself in the role of the writer in his own film about story telling? Now we know. And not only does he play the storyteller here, but the movie reveals a prophesy that his story reaches someone who ultimately brings about great change in our world. Now THAT's arrogance.That could all be forgiven if the story weren't so heavy handed and contrived at making its point. The elements are drawn with obtrusively broad strokes here. This is a manuscript written in black crayon--not the slender kind that you get in the 64-pack; oh, no, this is the big fat black crayon the kindergartners use.Hawthorne's ""Young Goodman Brown"" used similarly obvious techniques in presenting its allegorical elements--a wife named ""Faith,"" for example--but at least Hawthorne had a real point to make. The allegory actually stood for something. We could step away after having read it and ponder what it's saying.The same cannot be said for ""Lady in the Water."" The only thing that flies here is the eagle.If you can ignore such obviousness and contrivances, then some the characters are actually intriguing and enjoyable. Unfortunately, they just don't do enough here. Giamatti is wasted here. I genuinely liked Heep and was interested in his back story. Unfortunately, that occupies too tiny a space in a film that is preoccupied entirely with bludgeoning viewers with its moral.I think if Shyamalan ever ceases being self-absorbed he may go back and make this the movie it should have been minus all of his ego and contrivances.",Lady in the Water

From the start to finish it just meanders from one moronic scene to the next. The whole plot is a modern-day fantasy that has no real sense to it. I literally groaned out loud during several scenes. Later on, some scenes made me laugh out loud. From that point on I could not take the movie seriously and could only anxiously wait for the end. That was the best part of the movie...seeing the credits at the end.This is what happens when movie makers have early successes and then try to follow-up with even better films. It seems the maker of this farce is going in the opposite direction. I would have expected something better for my $9.00 ticket, my $5.00 bag of popcorn, and my $4.50 soda.

391,skatman44,Why Lady in the Water could be good for you.,8,31 March 2009,"There is no doubt that M. Night Shyamalan over the years has established himself as a visionary whether good or bad. Shyamalan creates films that very few else in writing have the imagination for. Sometimes, so far out that people bash Shyamalan for a bazaar craziness seen in his films. Lady in the Water is a film that does demand an open mind by the viewer, but is all-in-all a very entertaining film. Shyamalan plays a more extensive role in Lady in the Water then he has done in his previous films, and does a pretty good job. Paul Giamatii, like in many of his roles no matter how big or small gave a tremendous performance. Giamtti right off the bat has a very strong connection with his co-star Story, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. M. Night Shymalan with his followers seems to put out very hit and miss films, with some people disliking Signs but loving The Village. I believe that to each is his own, and that Lady in the Water is one film that should not be passed up.",Lady in the Water

The hum our is one of class with side characters which make usual fall guys but make no attempt to hide the fact that they are quirky stereotypes. The film starts by introducing the major players in a general sense but this act allows the viewer to fall into the story as if it is the bedtime story they have been waiting for since they were kids. The moments of fright are perfectly balanced with heart and bravery. Go into this film with a mindset that is child-like in its innocence and open-mindedness and you will walk out with a feeling of happiness and excitement that only a child can get away with.",Lady in the Water
393,porbeagle_zen,"Uneven, pretentious, and occasionally just bizarre",4,18 April 2007,"So much has been thrown around about ""Lady In The Water"" that it's hard to cut through the discourse it's generated. The film itself is not as bad as you've heard, but it's not nearly as masterful as the fans claim.We start off with an animated prologue worthy of Sunday-school class: knowing, somber, didactic. This kept my expectations mercifully low, probably why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 1. The next 15 minutes of film is a collection of related scenes that might have passed from an forgotten Robert Altman film, had they been filmed with vitality or intelligence.When the plot kicks it, ""Lady In The Water"" settles into its default mode: talking heads. People are on screen. We see their faces. They say something. Cut to another person. Their face. They say something. Cut back to the first... And so on. This isn't Chayefsky level dialogue. It's talk about Narfs, scrunts, rules, what happens when rules are broken... One hundred percent exposition. Many have commented that Shyamalan seems to be making up the rules as he goes along. I couldn't agree more. Believe it or not, this back and forth pseudo-profundity is the bulk of the movie.By the time of the inevitable climax and credits, I walked away feeling very little for the characters. In fact, feeling very little at all (except being glad it was over). Why? Maybe, as the fans accuse, I'm a hardened old cynic who doesn't believe in fairy tales anymore. Eh, I doubt that. It's more that nothing in the film FEELS convincing. We believe in the characters, the silly plot because we're SUPPOSED to. Not because Cleveland is an endearing dude, or because Story makes a cool Sea Nymph. There are plot holes you can drive a truck through. We're supposed to ignore them: Why? Because we're supposed to ""believe""! Duh! To make things stranger, Shyamalan seems intent on deconstructing the film as it's playing out. Some moments (like Story on the walkie-talkie, nearly every time the Critic speaks,) are so bizarre they play like self-parody. It's almost as if Shyamalan knows how convoluted this all is, and really wants to rub it in. But in doing so he breaks the semblance of story logic he's worked so hard (ahem) to establish, threatening to turn an innocent bedtime story into a postmodern, Pynchoneseque nightmare of clashing codes. Unfortunately, he doesn't.One of the most interesting aspects of LITW is the illusion of depth (not unlike a swimming pool at night. Heh.) Characters ramble about ""meaning"", ""purpose"", ""God"", etc. without saying anything important or meaningful. One common tactic Shyamalan uses is to throw out a New Age platitude whenever the plot starts to feel pointless. To someone reared on cinematic cotton candy, this must appear pretty deep indeed. For the rest of us.... let's just say that this is not Ingmar Bergman.Much has been said about Shyamalan casting himself as an messianic writer, so I won't go into it in depth. I will say - dumb move. Really dumb.To top things off, ""Lady In The Water"" looks boring. There are only a handful of shots that I thought looked intriguing, or even decent. The color scheme of badly lit. whites, greens, blues and browns is so overwhelming it makes a $75 million (!!) movie look like a student production. Where did the budget go? This could have been a really cool movie. I mean it. If Shyamalan had either (a) constructed a believable, coherent fantasy world, or (b) upped the conflict between premodern myth and postmodern confusion, this might have been genuinely interesting. But the almighty Ego seems to have gotten in the way. In his quest for True Vision, the auteur has forgotten many of the essential elements of storytelling, leaving us with a threadbare plot held together with ""Johnathan Livingston Seagull"" clichés.""Lady In The Water"" joins the ranks of would-be masterpieces hindered by hubris, like ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""1941"" before it.",Lady in the Water
394,analyst12,Watch with Wide-eyed Wonder,9,4 February 2007,"Critics have largely given negative reviews for this film, which isn't surprising considering the fate of a prominent movie critic in the plot. However, don't let this stop you from renting the film. Suffice it to say, critics don't like it when someone gets them where they live, and this is no exception.A friend put it best: watch the film as if you're a kid again. When we're children, fairy tales are pure magic. They remind us that the world is full of special people, that it's a place where anything can happen, and with the right opportunity, we can have a life that's full of meaning. The major motif of the film is about finding out a person's purpose in life, and simultaneously, a realization of how exactly profound and dangerous these realizations can be.Shyamalan's got guts to spare in this film, as it's powerfully acted out by a great working cast, and his own cameo role is one of the most poignant in the film. What makes this film equally fun and mysterious is the way that there's no singular ""plot twist"" or stunning revelation endings in this one. Everything's a matter of guesswork and perspective. One character defines the adventure as profound journey to discover ""one's purpose,"" which is never easy or predictable.This is a really rewarding film, emotionally, if you watch it with a sense of wide-eyed wonder; the skeptic and the critic alike will lose the magic as surely as a dream on the wind of time unless they learn how to hold onto it like a child's promise.

399,nickspinner-65201,All over the map; even the thought-provoking material is confused or simplistic.,5,7 August 2020,"I think this could have worked well if there was some focus/unity. For example, have a guy read his kids a bedtime story (of his own making). Portray him as a dreamer before that night, with his wife working and he is taking care of the kids. He's an artist or something along those lines. After his kids fall asleep he goes to clean his pool, slips and hits his head, and then appears to awaken to find a creature from his bedtime story come to life, etc. Then at the end we see him in the hospital and it was a ""Wizard of Oz"" sort of situation. Still, it would have to be made for an children's audience (with enough for the adults to enjoy) or make it ""dark"" and more or a horror movie, perhaps with some absurd or black humor. The problem I find with his movies is that there is too much much that should be edited out or some ""touches"" need to be added to maintain the audience's interest, but instead it just becomes more muddled over time, until the twist ending, which makes one think it should just be a half hour Twilight Zone episode and then it might work.",Lady in the Water
400,Ironclad,Lady in the Water: A Wonderful Escapist Fantasy Film,10,18 November 2007,"I just saw ""Lady in the Water"", and I was quite surprised by this film. When watching the previews for this, I thought it would be another B grade horror film. However, I was extremely surprised and pleased with what I saw.The basic plot is that there is this superintendent of an apartment complex in Philadelphia, named Cleveland, who is doing his maintenance job duties in the apartment complex: killing bugs, plumbing, cleaning the pool, emptying the garbage, etc. We get a snapshot of the various tenants in this apartment building, including a new tenant whom Cleveland is showing around. A tenant is complaining about the scummy pool, and the reason why is a bit of a mystery. He finds someone, a woman, swimming in the pool. He goes in after her, and hits his head and falls into the swimming pool. When he wakes, he finds that she has brought him back to his apartment and that is where the adventure begins.Cleveland tries to do the right thing, feeling it inappropriate to have a scantily clad young lady in his apartment, and he tries to take her out at dawn to give her coffee and get rid of her. However, some sort of wolf like monster comes after them, and they run screaming back to his apartment.As the film progresses, we find out, from the Korean university student and her grandmother's and mother's bedtime story, that this person from the water is a Narf, and the monster after her is a Scrunt. She wants to return to the oceans, but this monster is preventing her from doing so. A host of human helpers are recruited from the apartment to assist her harrowing escape.I won't say how or whom or why, but suffice it to say, this film is very creative, with twists and turns and edge of the seat suspense, humor, and nice special effects. I like the cinematography a lot, and the musical score is also quite lovely and appropriate.I was pleasantly surprised with Lady in the Water.

401,reismark,"Once again, the critics missed the point.",9,24 July 2006,"The major problem M. Night Shyamalan has had to face in recent years is exactly what he strikes out against through this film: being typecast, erroneously and viciously, by the production companies who steward his pictures and by the critics who go into his films expecting something ordinary and then bashing him needlessly because he ended up giving them something completely unexpected. Isn't that the point of film-making - to try new things, to think outside the box, and most importantly, to tell new, original *stories*?I was so hopeful when the initial advertisements trumpeted this film as a ""bedtime story"". Why Warner Brothers abandoned that direction and went with the more conventional thriller angle (which this film, by all means, is most definitely NOT), I'll never figure out; if they had continued with the ""bedtime story"" idea, it would have played better with a movie-going public that's led around blindly by the pied piper that are the movie critics. Are there moments in the film where a strong suspension of disbelief is required? Sure, but isn't it that way with any bedtime story that you might tell your kids?What I'm ultimately saying is that the critics looked past the big picture to nitpick on the small details, as if they're trying to top Shyamalan's admittedly arrogant attitude out of spite. (It's true that by casting himself in the role of the writer whom Story inspires to change the world, that he's opening himself up to those kinds of attacks - but can you really fault him when his performance is as strong as anyone else's in the film?) This is a wonderful *story* with many layers that will reveal themselves upon repeat viewings, and a more intelligent piece of entertainment than other films that will earn more at the box office (like Click) or received more praise from the critics (like the Clerks sequel) could ever dream of being.

Unlike his other movies this one does not depend on his trade-mark surprise ending which has, at least in my opinion, disappointed at least once. There is a surprise ending but it is more charming than shocking and caps the story off brilliantly. More like Unbreakable than the Village, this ice-cream cone simply has a different flavor at the core, not sour bubblegum.Throughout Lady in the Water I felt a certain pleasant nostalgia. It only struck me later that the movie bears a number of similarities to the very successful Never Ending Story (the original movie, not the string of progressively more confusing sequels).Lady in the Water took the deadly risk of self analysis and capped that off with a bit of morbid comedy when the reviewer came face to face with the reviewed. I think it worked.I really enjoyed the elemental theme of water which was so strong throughout the movie. I really enjoy water, swimming, life guarding and teaching swimming lessons but I guess it's not for everyone. Water seems to play an important part in Shyamalan's movies. I wonder if he had a near drowning experience. This is a fascinating way of dealing with such an issue.So much wasn't said in the movie and that I really appreciate. He gives the audience a little credit and doesn't spoon feed us. It was never said that the monster was afraid of water, yet all the time it was clear that it was. The water seemed like a protective barrier. It was a symbol and a shield, and a surprise to make you jump out of your seat.Many elements were just disturbing but there was a clear sense of right and wrong and morality. The guardian and his weightlifting were just bizarre and that is what I remember most strongly about the movie because I've never seen that before. The morality of the healer and that the movie did not need gratuitous adult scenes to work was a welcome relief.I thought it was a fantastic movie. I'll have to agree that it is not for everyone. It is only for people who dream.Mark Charke www.Charke.ca",Lady in the Water
404,puneet2004,A story well told but nothing else,6,19 January 2007,"As is expected of Shyamalan, Lady in the Water was a story well told yet unlike him, the story was nothing to write home about. It was a weird kind of a flick, not not irritating in any way. The best kind of audience would have been kids or young teens. In fact, they would not have understood it that well, as all of Shyamalan's movies do have a fair share of intellect required and same is the case here, but then the story is hard to digest for most adults. We could treat it as a science fiction, but i guess it cannot be classified as that either. So what we do have in the end is a movie devoid of a real genre and ambiguous with regards to the target audience. I give it a 6 on 10 just because the direction was good as always and the acting performances were also pretty decent.",Lady in the Water
405,britneeharvey,not worth seeing..,1,3 October 2006,"I really didn't like this movie. I went in expecting to see a scary movie, but come to find out, it wasn't even scary. It was scary in like, 2-3 scenes. But the commercials definitely had me wanting to see a good horror movie. It was all very confusing and very.. odd. It was about this girl that came out of a BOOK? And she had to find her leader or something. I don't really know, I probably feel asleep. Lol, no, but come to find out she was her own leader and she had to secretly escape this monsters.. that only the leaders could see. Man, I don't know, I saw this like a month ago, I forget some of it, but what I do remember is it wasn't worth my time. It's a very unrealistic movie. It was misleading, it more ways than one. I didn't like it one bit.",Lady in the Water
406,maroonmagik,A little disappointment?,5,29 December 2006,"I thought that for a Shamaylan movie, Lady in the Water was a little disappointing. I was expecting the big twist at the end that is signature to Shamaylan, but it never came. It was an original idea on Shamaylan's part; here's one bedtime story I've never heard before. But certain parts of the movie were a little disappointing. Why exactly was Reggie the Guardian? He had one of the smallest parts in the movie, yet he had the biggest role in bringing Story home. The movie did leave me hiding behind my fingers on a couple of jumpy moments, which is a good quality for any movie in my book. I was a little disturbed by the lack of Story's wardrobe. Do they not wear clothes in the Blue World? Overall, I think it's a DVD worth watching.",Lady in the Water
407,Dribbleglass,Am I Missing Something?,1,30 January 2007,"I'm no film scholar or deconstructionist, so I may have had the gist of this movie go over my head. Having said that, I felt a mixture of puzzlement and a vague sense of betrayal after viewing this film.I thought ""Sixth Sense"" was an excellent film (I had the good fortune to see it early on), possibly the best movie of it's kind I've ever seen, but M.Nights turnout has been sporadic at best since then.The story is an absurd hodgepodge of archetypical nonsense with words like ""narf"" thrown in and references to the ""blue world"", whatever the hell that is. Apparently it's underwater or something.It is a beautiful film to look at, and there's some great actors in it. I almost felt like I was watching some hidden-camera show where talented actors are assembled to be made fools of.It's hard to even find a starting point in the ridiculousness. The apartment building has a pool. In the bottom of this pool is a human-sized grate which leads apparently into some sort of catacomb. A paunchy middle-aged handyman can swim around in there for quite a while on a single eight-ounce glass of air.There's a monstery sort of dog-like thing which looks like it could be dealt with quite effectively with a weedeater, and some monkey guys in the bushes. I guess it's all symbolic, or something.Then there's this eagle-ish guy who carries the lady who lives in the pool away at the end, although the camera-man had apparently and inconveniently been pushed into the pool at that point, so you really don't get to see too much of him. My feeling is, if you're traveling to a destination deep in the sea, an eagle may not be your ideal mode of transportation. But what do I know? There's no end to the idiocy, as the tenants band together to try to ""solve"" whatever the mystery is supposed to be, with people representing different meaningless archetypes like ""healer"" and ""guide"". Crossword puzzles seem to have something to do with it, and then they don't. I almost felt like Shayalaman was trying to see just how bad a hunk of crap he could sell the public. Just because it's pretentious doesn't make it art. Sorry. Back to the drawing board. His juice from 6thS may have got this movie made, but he's running on fumes with this clunker. Or am I missing something?",Lady in the Water
408,samuri5,Shyamalan Finally Hits Back...,10,25 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan has the enviable/unenviable position of being an original. This can be a double edged sword. Having a huge hit such as The 6th Sense puts added pressure on such a relatively young filmmaker/visionary. For every Michael Bay, we need a dozen Shyamalans to bring balance to American film. The two are polar opposites, Bay driven my noise and chase, while Shyamalan respects the craft of story. He can still deliver a jolt in most unexpected ways, and there is no shortage of jolts here. I saw it last night and there were a few SCREAMS provided.M. Night Shyamalan gives us depth. While the ""blockbuster factories"" stick with ""the formula,"" with carefully calculated ""plot points"" occurring at specified moments, even PAGES, of a script, Shyamalan instead lets character and story drive his films, over chases and explosions and over the top, overloud soundtrack.(okay, here's a SPOILER...skip this is you haven't seen it...) His frustration with the smothering studio, dollar driven manufacturing heads is becoming the stuff of legend in Hollywood. This certainly is evident in Lady, especially given the treatment of the film critic and his monologue prior to his demise. There was a great giggly irony that Bob Balaban portrayed the critic, given his body of work and independent roots. (minor SPOILER...) Shyamalan makes great films. The Village was under-appreciated, as this film is already apparently destined to be. By casting himself in a pivotal role, I felt Shyamalan was speaking directly to audiences and critics and film execs. He could look them/us in the eye. He speaks of his ""cookbook,"" his view of the world and what's happening in it. His films appear to be his ""cookbook."" (end SPOILER alert) Like Wells, Kurosawa, and Spielberg (lofty comparisons, I know, but I feel worthy), Shyamalan's ""good"" films are still superior to the typical mainstream films dumped into theaters. This, however, is beyond ""good."" I'm not sure it's his BEST, but compared to the noisy, plotted by numbers films cramming the other theaters, this is easily one of the better films this summer, and this has been a good year. Some soul seems to be returning to developing characters, most notably in Superman Returns.Shyamalan makes a great plea for letting independent artists work independently. I hope the studios here it, if they are not deafened by the sounds of coins being dropped into the hopper. I wish this film great success. We need more high profile directors championing story over sequel.",Lady in the Water
409,shadyzlady555,The previews ruined my expectations,1,26 June 2007,"The previews for this movie made it seem like this scary ghost story of a lady in the water. I was excited to watch it because I was waiting to be scared out of my mind. I went with plenty of people to watch this movie and my expectations were shattered. It was a ridiculous movie that was far from scary. I don't think that any part of the movie, AT ALL, made me scared. The thing that was supposed to be scary was a paper thin glowing animal that looked so ridiculous. The movie was actually funny, so I give it props for that. However when you're expecting to see horror, you get a little disappointed when it becomes a comedy. I really disliked this movie. I doubt I'll ever watch it again because it would feel like pure torture. It was too corny and misleading for me to ever watch again.",Lady in the Water
410,ashe0211,Underrated and a good watch :),7,7 December 2015,"I saw this in the theater when it first came out, after seeing all of M Nights others movies I was sorely disappointed. It wasn't until after talking with a few friends and buying the DVD that I really got an appreciation of what the director was trying to do. I found myself in a dark room and let all other thoughts leave my mind. That's when I started getting engulfed in the story and really connecting with the characters. I felt all sorts of emotions during the movie and even learned some things about it that I had missing previously. I know a lot of people hate on this movie, and I was one of them. After seeing it again I was completely taken by the story and had a new feeling for the movie.",Lady in the Water
411,lpas220,"Another great, misunderstood film by M. Night",8,22 July 2006,"As I read the reviews by both professional and amateur critics, one string connects almost all of them - they've been duped again and don't like it. Every time a new M. Night movie comes out, the movie-going public expects a rehashing of The Sixth Sense - they want the scary suspense movie with a TWIST. Shyamalan's genius as a filmmaker comes from his talent to surprise us every time. The Sixth Sense made us jump out of our seats and then lean forward with our jaws dropped open in shock at the ending. Unbreakable challenged our perception of the world around us; Signs did the same. The Village took our perception of the world he presented and twisted it on us yet again. Lady in the Water is a great film simply because Shyamalan is refusing to fit into the little square hole we've got ready for him. He's certainly not the standard round peg, either. He's been a different shape every time and the critics are raving mad about it.Lady in the Water takes place in an apartment complex in which a motley crew of people live. There's the Korean girl who goes clubbing every night under the pretense of studying and her mother who prefers she marry a dentist; there's the single father with his five daughters who squeal and scream in unison at a giant insect under their sink; there's the guy who wants to be some strange science project by working out only his right side; there's the hilarious group of stoners who refuse to follow the no-smoking rule; etc. In charge of them all is the superintendent, Cleveland Heep, played by Paul Giamatti. Heep is a stuttering, polite man who fixes that broken lightbulb and still manages to play ringmaster to the circus his tenants make up. The action begins when Heep catches that elusive person who has been swimming after 7pm in the pool - a girl named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard). She says she's from The Blue World and needs to get home. The premise revolves around her role as a nymph from a bedtime story and her enemies who are trying to prevent her success.Shyamalan weaves a brilliant fantasy in Lady in the Water that takes the public's perception of him as a filmmaker and drowns it. He himself plays a major character and his acting is rather good. Also brilliantly played is the ""new guy"" - a film critic named Harry Farber(Bob Babalan). This man is so egotistical and pompous, you can't help but loathe him, yet at the same time, you love his tirades about movies of all genres.Shyamalan speaks directly to the audience in this film. He is laughing at us and at our discomfort. He refuses to be pigeonholed as one kind of filmmaker and he uses this film, masterfully, to yet again knock us off our pedestals. What viewers of Shyamalan's films need to learn is to have an open mind - expect to be surprised and that's all. Learn to NOT know what's coming. Because if you've learned to expect a twist, Shyamalan is prepared to give you a different kind of twist with Lady in the Water.",Lady in the Water
412,jshardy13-1,"Just wait for it, you'll like it.",9,29 July 2006,"I must say that I went to see this with my girlfriend, at her request, and not even half way through the film she wanted to leave. I have a very reasonable expectation from movies and generally go in with the suspense of all belief and accept what the writer has put before me. I found it interesting and knew that a backstory was building. She was ready to leave because it was moving so slowly. Needless to say I asked her to wait it out and let herself get to know the characters and to pay attention to the story itself. As soon as the tempo picked up and the action started happening I asked her if she wanted to leave and she quickly, and without hesitation, said ""NO!"". She loved the movie and was impressed with how she got to know the characters better. Basically all I'm saying is that it's a good movie and not a horror, action, drama, suspense, thriller, or any other type of movie that the mass majority wants to pigeonhole films into. Just sit down and watch it, you may enjoy it. The problem is that too many people want everything to fall into this little, narrow field of understanding and don't like to think for themselves. This movie makes you slow down and look at things from a different view. Give it a shot, you may be surprised. And as for the critics, what do they know. They get to sit around a trash talk other people's work for money. If they're so great then why aren't they writing, producing, or directing?",Lady in the Water
413,daviddiamond,"How to watch ""Lady in the Water""",10,20 August 2006,"How to watch ""Lady in the Water"" This was one of M. Night Shyamalan's best movies. My wife and I absolutely loved it.We were both wondering why the movie received so many poor reviews. We didn't expect much from the professional critics anyway, but M. Night's direct panning of the critics cinched that. It is understandable that he feels the way that he does about the critics, and that he expresses that in the movie. We have also found that viewers, in general, vary widely in their ability to appreciate and/or understand movies that do not fit a standard mold, or movies that present concepts, assumptions or states of consciousness, outside of typical, everyday experiences.The movie is perfectly what it is. It is not a horror film designed to be as scary or gory as a chain-saw massacre, although there is enough suspense and danger to create a riveting tension. It is not a chase movie designed to hold your attention with non-stop action. It is not a real-world drama that has rigid requirements for believability. It is not designed to be a comedy, although it certainly has enough humor to keep a lightness about it. It is a story. It is a story about a story, which is the story. It is a bed-time tale, carefully balanced using feedback from the children for whom it was written.Nor is the movie an ego-trip, as some reviewers suggested, designed to portray M. Night as savior of humanity. He is simply casting himself into the role to which he relates and aspires most closely. Many of us day-dream of being able to do more for mankind, and to invest the time and energy to effect positive changes. M. Night shares that dream, but also realizes that the true activist for change faces grave dangers, and must be willing to accept them and proceed anyway.This movie is a work of art, and must be viewed as such  a dynamic play of composition, motion, relationships, and unfolding ""reality"" and understanding  a little bit at a time. It is a bedtime story, and must be viewed as such; it is to be experienced though the innocence and openness of a child. It is a mystery, with enough complexity and twists to actively engage and deceive the audience until its conclusion. It is a celebration of rich diversity of ethnocentricity and personality, which M. Night highlights through his delightful caricatures. It is a celebration of community, where each person has a special role to play in the synergy of the whole. It is a study of fear, hope, error, danger, courage, strength, faith and resolution, and hope for the future.M. Night Shyamalan tells us how to understand the movie throughout, with his metaphors of film critics, of repressed talents, of cookies & milk, of story, of Story, of community, of misinterpretations of relationships & roles, of prophecy, and of gradual piecing together of a larger understanding.""Lady in the Water"" is a totally enveloping experience, containing all of the support needed to bring the viewer into its alternate reality. But in order for that magic to happen, the viewer must suspend existing beliefs, concepts and expectations, and experience the movie with total openness.",Lady in the Water
414,fender12str,Don't give in to the critics,8,22 July 2006,"No matter if M. Night Shyamalan completely catches us off guard or you wait for the twist and go ""OOOH"", he is always entertaining. Anyone who criticizes this movie has put this writer/director in a class and they want him to follow their idea of what he should do next.I believe Shyamalan is a formula director/writer. I also believe that he knows this. He just happens to have created a new formula that works. If your looking for a Canns or Sundance Film festival winner of a movie then by all means, avoid this one. But if you're a Shyamalan fan, then go see it.The reason Sixth Sense was so good was because it was a new approach. Throw the audience a curve ball. But how many times can anyone do that? Shyamalan didn't try. He took his skills and used them in a new way.This movie was thoroughly enjoyable for exactly what it was. If it was marketed as a horror movie and you didn't see it that way, then blame marketing, not the film itself. It contained horror, fantasy, comedy, and drama. Giamatti's acting did make this film for me and Shyamalan knows how to draw the right stuff from his actors.It's a Shyamalan formula with a unique Shyamalan story. Go see it",Lady in the Water

The movie is billed as a horror movie in the trailers. You can summarize this director: 2 good movies to start, 2 stupid movies that followed, and 1 movie--this one--that doesn't even deserve recognition. Maybe the makers of King Kong should have shown Japanese teenagers racing motorcycles in the previews for Kong. Sure there's no relationship to the movie King Kong, but similarly, there is no relationship between this movie's trailer and its content. Just annoying. Save your money.

How can a trailer be so wonderful, and the film be so awful? What was the point? Simply stated, this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. The actors give it a great try. And there are moments of comic relief, some tongue-in cheek humor. But to me, they looked like they were going to crack up laughing at some parts. I did not get any spiritual message from the film. I did not understand the meaning or intent. The film is boring, and I found the main character (Story) to be uninteresting. I didn't even understand why she went to The Cove. There was not one minute I was rooting for her to get where she wanted to be. Even Cleveland is more appealing in the trailer. I was emotionally moved by the trailer and during the film I was very emotionally detached. I could continue, but why waste more time discussing the film? I already wasted two hours today seeing it.",Lady in the Water

I found the characters all to be most unlikeable and uninteresting. Personally, I like offbeat plots and science fiction, but I can only describe this script as silly, ridiculous, and totally laughable. The ads for this film said something to the extent that the movie will make you believe the unbelievable. That's a real joke. Shyamalan doesn't do that at all. I personally never bought into the story, and after two hours of a swimming pools with hidden underground caves, grass-backed wolves, and countless glassy-eyed, ""I went to acting school for this"" stares into space from the Lady in the Water named Story(Bryce Dallas Howard), I couldn't wait for the ending credits.",Lady in the Water

Lady in Water is an all around gratifying experience in every aspect of film entertainment. This film has many different levels of entertaining the audience. One moment there laughing hysterically in there seat, the next there holding back tears of emotion, then finally the audience is coiled in an enigma awaiting a climatic fright. Critics and those looking for the next Sixth Sense will probably be let down. Lady in Water is a beautiful and uplifting film about the greatness of humanity, you have to allow yourself to become a child and just enjoy a great film/folk-tale.",Lady in the Water

Night weaves an epic tale of a mysterious girl, who appears from a hotel swimming pool, whose life and purpose seem to coincide with an old Chinese bedtime story...what to we get from this? A really fun movie!!! Don't let adverts deceive you, as they may have with Signs or The Village, somehow, ever since The 6th Sense, Night's movies have been advertised as horror, but they're not. They are wonderful, original stories, and while it may be a stretch to call some ""wonderful"", i defiantly have an easy time praising this film, and giving it my full recommendation.Pros: Suspense is played with very well, through use of good lighting and good music. Never great, but good. The story is amazingly original and inspiring, portrayed well with excellent actors, for the most part very wise casting decisions. The pacing is excellent, and the movie ends just on time, without cutting it short, or trying to stretch. Held my attention all the way through, and really got to me on an emotional level. Also, a few VERY funny moments...Cons: Few and far between. Some may say a poor casting choice was Night casting himself as an important character this time around, but I think he did an excellent job! Really, the few cons I can think of...the main character seems to excepting of whats going on around him, not stopping to question the bizarre. Also, the opening story telling sequence was weak and mostly irrelevant..Overall, 8/10...a jewel among the rough this summer, I highly recommend this.

Since Sixth Sense, he has made one great film after another, in my opinion. I even liked The Village. Well, here is his first movie that sucks. This movie should never have been made, quite honestly. It's a boring, amateurish story that Night used to tell his kids as a bedtime story. Whatever made him think this would be a good movie is beyond me. I never saw LITW in the theater, and I'm glad I didn't. What a waste of time. Now I know why Disney didn't want to distribute it...it truly made no sense at all. The plot actually felt like they were making it up as they went along. There is even a writer character (played by Bob Balaban) who mocks the story from within the movie! And Night casting himself in a key role was also a mistake. It also should have been rated PG instead of PG-13, since there is really nothing scary in it at all, outside of a grimacing, bad-CGI wolf.",Lady in the Water

422,june_ai,Better Than What 'They' Said,7,5 April 2007,"""Lady In The Water"" is not as good as ""Sixth Sense"". But it is his second-best, well if not third-best (I also think ""The Village"" is a good movie). Because I had heard so many negative reviews about LITW, I was prepared to see a 'bad' one. And in the end of the movie, I thought to myself: ""Hey, it isn't as bad as they said. It's even better!"".I know the background for the story is a bit 'out of this world'. This is a consequence. But I don't think it would bother you as much. If you already accept the fundamental of the story, this movie is actually quite enjoyable. The movie runs a bit slow, but it allows the time to understand the story. It allows just enough time to watch the characters develop.Paul Giamatti is believable as a stressed-out character, quiet but kind one (of course how he could trust a stranger in a snap is a bit odd, we should just leave it out, however this is the kind of movie that you don't want to be logically explained). He feels such a heavy burden, and I could get the feeling. The mystery woman, ""Story"" really shines. She is almost inhuman. I mean, you can see (or feel) that she is the other creature.As usual, I keep looking for the morale in the story. The scene that has the most impact on me is actually when Vick asked Story the reason why he will create a chain-reaction, despite the fact that he is a no-body. I can not explain why, but it makes me thinking that great people with great thoughts do sacrifice for the sake of humanity.I think it's well-done.

""Lady in the Water"" is filled with characters who are shallow racial stereotypes, devoid of all personality or interest, and the film's attempt at humor is pathetic at best.

From the creatures to the story, this movie was very original and it flowed well from beginning to end. This movie contained many twists. It made me gasp! Overall its a great mythical story.This movie had many different moments. From very emotional moments to very frightening moments. The portrayal of the story was very well thought out. The acting in this movie was superb enough for people to enjoy.You must watch this movie NOT as a supernatural thriller or a horror movie, but as a mythical tale with deep meaning into it. This movie is VERY DIFFERENT compared to all of M. Night's movies.However, In technical terms, this movie had its flaws. The camera angles appeared a bit shaky in the near beginning of the movie, but improved near the end. The special effects surprisingly improved from his previous movies. The creatures looked well and the CGI was good. James Newton Howard really captured the moments with his moody and calm score.Overall, Lady in the Water is an enjoyable movie.

426,Jeffscr5,The Parable of Lady in the Water,10,29 July 2006,"Parable: An earthly story with a heavenly meaning.First, in order to understand the Truth behind Lady in the Water, we must understand the semiology of the characters and elements involved in the story. Each character in this narrative represents a part in all of us that either enables or hinders us from carrying out our ordained purpose.Character Representation: Cleveland Heap- Cleveland represents the average person who is living an idle mundane life. He represents the individual as a whole who is not fulfilling their purpose. This individual avoids their calling by preoccupying themselves with mundane labor that ""anybody can do."" But, eventually their mind sees a glimpse of light and they come to the turning point in their life, which is why he is aptly named Cleveland, ""Land of Cliffs"". He can either jump or stay on the land to make the difference God intended for him. We all have an ebenezer, something that is holding us back from acting upon our purpose. Cleveland's crutch was his prolonged mourning and suffering over his family's death, causing him to live a futile life. Only when Cleveland submitted his burdens before God did he become revitalized because his purpose became clear.Story- Story represents faith and purity and Christ. Faith comes to us through Christ to make us pure in the eyes of God. Faith is difficult to understand and isn't always clear. Faith becomes stronger when others believe, like having the guild and witnesses present during the resurrection. By accepting faith alone we can be redeemed and our eyes will see our purpose in this world.Mr. Farber- Mr. Farber represents one of the devil's greatest tools; he is the cynic, the empiricist and the pragmatist in us all. He is the devil on our left shoulder telling us that there is no purpose for us and that ""everything has been done, originality doesn't exist."" Mr. Farber allows history to be his guide instead of faith. Mr. Farber is that reclusive pessimist that will not allow us to take the risk of believing and in turn hides behind intellectual security. Mr. Farber is the person who was standing in between Cleveland and his pure heart (the pool) when he awoke after his encounter with the scrunt.Vick Ran- Vick represents that ambition or passion in us all that knows our purpose but gets stymied by petty environmental distractions (laundry, light out). Vick has a powerful purpose, but he will not be able to witness his impact on this world directly. His influence will captivate another who will go on to captivate millions. Many people give up when empirical results are not achieved on the first attempt, but the impact of one person's life can only be measured by the legacy that he or she transfers to others. The message in this bedtime story is: as long as you are carrying out your purpose you will feel complete. Even if your purpose seems insignificant in a worldly sense at the moment, it is contributing to a greater design.Young Sun- ""Young"" represents the childlike faith in us all. We are told that we must have a childlike faith when we first believe; we have to deflect the influence of the degrading society, scientific theories, and have a strong desire to pursue faith and wisdom.Mr. Dury- Mr. Dury (crossword-puzzler) represents the technical part of our mind that can only take us so far. Technical wisdom reaches a dead end when confronted with interpretative/analytical thought and leaves no room for faith. Technical intelligence can only satisfy a portion of our purpose, without faith we are empty, which is the feeling Mr. Dury got when he could not contribute any further to the cause.Reggie- Reggie, the man who works out only one half of his body represents our physical strengths and weaknesses. There is a dichotomy in us all physically. We all have physical strengths and weaknesses that make us unique. That uniqueness enables us to fulfill our ultimate ordained purpose. However, humans tend to focus more on their weakness, which can ultimately blind them from their strengths.Smoking Hippy crew- The smoking crew represents the phlegmatic part of us all that hinders the manifestation of our true purpose. If the phlegmatic part of us prevails, we become stagnant and end up clouding our finds and filling the voids with sinful acts and ideas. Idle bodies do not fulfill their purpose; therefore, they are not propelling the advancement of themselves or society.Mr. Leeds- Mr. Leeds represents the voice of God in us all. His first statement after years of silence is ""does man deserve to be saved?"" Just as God, Our Father sought wrath on the sinful man, he has redeemed us through his Son. God wants to see the child-like faith in us all, just as Mr. Leeds said during Story's resurrection. Cleveland's answer of ""Yes"" to the question is wrong because man is undeserving and he needs to submit himself to the higher power and allow himself/herself to be used for His purpose. Mr. Leeds also exhibits omniscience as the only one who knows that the death of his family is what's keeping Cleveland from living his purpose. Which is why Mr. Leeds constantly refers to Cleveland as ""son."" Mr. Leeds represents our Leader.(continued in message boards)",Lady in the Water
427,byanoski,Great!,9,1 February 2007,"M. Night Shyamalan is amazing. I myself do films as a hobby, at age 17, I can't really say it's a profession or anything but I work a lot on creating movies/films. If someone were to ask me ""Who is your favorite..."" my answer would probably be M. Night Shyamalan for both writer and director. He's brilliant. I've seen all of his movies, except for, ironically, The Sixth Sense. Each movie I've seen, although some not as good as others, were great for the way it was done. Plot's aside, the composition of each scene, the angles used, the acting expertise and his trademark of including himself in every movie...it's great. I can't say that there is another person in the film world that is as talented. Steven Spielberg is great, I love his movies, but they're all too Hollywood. I love Jerry Bruckheimer as a producer, he's one of the best but again too Hollywood.M. Night has this way of making a movie look great while not making it too ""Hollywood"" and I love his work for that.This movie continues this tradition, it was composed well, and has an excellent story with great acting, great composition and more. It's well worth watching.",Lady in the Water
428,BRomer88,M. Night delivers yet again!,10,22 July 2006,"I must start by saying that M. Night is without a doubt one of my favorite directors/writer. I feel very satisfied after all of his films. Unlike many I even really enjoyed The Village. I was so excited to go and see this movie in hopes that I would love it as much as his other films and as I expected I did.I loved seeing another side of M. Night. This movie was more focused on the characters rather than the ""scare factor"". And unlike I'm sure others will interpret Lady in the Water, I was very pleased with this version of his creative vision as well.I also thought that the acting was superb. I was very impressed with M. Night's acting ability. He had had smaller roles in all of his movies but he had a much more central role in this movie and I thought he was wonderful. Paul Giamatti was also perfect. He mixed all his sides of acting in this movie. I was perfect with the drama and did beautifully with the comedy. Bryce Dallas Howard also did a great job. She was given less lines that Byrce but she did a fabulous job showing her emotions through her looks and eyes. Even all of the smaller, but important roles had perfect actors to play them.I also loved the comedy that M. Night had in this film. There were many points that had the theater giggle and one point in the film that had me crying I was laughing so hard. I thought this was very refreshing that someone could so perfectly mix comedy, drama, and suspense. Just another example of what a genius M. Night is in his writing and directing.The plot was also very interesting. I found myself wanting to know the end of this fairy tale so much. I really found no holes or dull moments in this film. All in all, I thought that this was a great movie and just another example of why M. Night is such a genius and also one of my favorite, if not my favorite, director. Go and see this movie with an open mind!! P.S. I you don't want to go see this movie because you don't like The Village don't let that hold you back because I would in no way compare these two movies except for the classic traits that M. Night puts in all of his films!",Lady in the Water
429,kreagan82,Similar to a small breathless child creating a story at the dinner table.,3,1 August 2006,"This movie is horrible. Continuity was forgotten. Plot line is whimsical. Screen shots are weak and uninteresting. Everyone follows a stereo-type. Actually, a lot of characters are so shallow that their only personality are their stereo-type - from the stoners to the Jewish New York. The fairy-tale made hardly any sense and we, the audience, are just forced to swallow this sporadic muck. M. Night Shyamalan needs to get off his high horse - I swear he wrote this movie to make him feel better. Annoying observation: Almost all the characters lack depth or any character development. Quite a few ""important"" characters do not surface until the end and are quite passive in the story. These characters are just there - holding hardly any form of importance in the movie - but have importance in the fairy-tale that encompasses the 2 hours of confusion I had to watch.",Lady in the Water
430,Nessy_Gliana,Beautiful...,9,22 August 2006,"I think I was one of the very few who actually looked forward to this latest project by M. Night. I saw the teaser for it in cinemas when I went to see Star Wars Episode III and from the very beginning it piqued my interest. I downloaded the official trailer during the summer and became even more excited. The days up to its release were almost torturous-I wanted to see it so bad! I can safely say it was well worth my time.Sure, the acting may not have been very brilliant, and the story may have been a little hurriedly put together, but hey, that's what bedtime stories are like. They don't proclaim to be artfully and masterfully scripted, but they have a quality of wonder that widens the eyes of children in spite of that fact. The only thing I was really bothered by was all the tight close-ups. But even that wasn't so bad. Once I got used to it, I realized this was M. Night's way of bringing us into the world of the characters.This may or may not be M. Night's best work-I'll leave that to the real Shyalmalan enthusiasts to decide-but it definitely had that ""storylike"" quality to it. The story had an original mythology behind it, which I liked. Bryce was lovely as the Madame Narf. None of the helpers were who you'd thought they were. The scrunt was creepy. The music was haunting. And the dialog was absolutely beautiful. Clevland's speech to his children took my breath away.In the end, Lady in the Water is not about cinematic brilliance, shocking and scaring the audience, or pleasing the critics. It's about telling a bedtime story that even adults can enjoy.That's enough to please this fantasy fan.",Lady in the Water

In all truth, M Night S movies have been delightful treats in the worst possible ways. I watched LITW twice by now and i still wish i know what are the underlying message on top of 'we are meant for a purpose' theme. I mean, could there be political symbolism in the fairy tale of the narf? is there more to the story? Or is it meant as a treat to the pressuring minds of the people of this age. A cookie mix to simply enjoy the ride in the world of fantasy. The scenes are beautiful, the script is brilliant. Yet, you cant watch and expect something 'logical' not in this movie. There is no surprise to the conclusion of the story. No big surprise like The Village or The Sixth Sense. But its a story spinned to entertain. Perhaps i will find out the message MNS is actually trying to instill. But until then, i would simply enjoy the tales of Story.",Lady in the Water

Night Shamalyn keeps fighting the good fight and sticking his neck out for the sake of those who can sit through an entire movie without getting distracted. Still, he gets such bad press, and here is another brilliant movie that has been described and labeled ""stupid"", simply because some have no imagination anymore, and they would rather watch a movie where the characters are simple, the plot self-explanatory, and the storyline common. ""Lady In The Water"" is quite the opposite. It is something so uncommon and foreign, that no one will take a chance on it, with fear of being looked down upon by the 90% of people who hate this movie, and despise Shamalyn even more for continuing to make movies.I advise you to see this movie, and not to listen to the guy in the rental line, who reeks of marijuana, and tells you, ""Man that movie sucks(holds up the movie he is renting)...you should see the new Jackass movie.""

This movie is something incredible. I am not going to describe the story or the characters, that can be seen in the other reviews which are detailed and well made. I am just going to say my word since almost every review in the papers are negative.this movie is something that cannot be described as a genre itself, its something more. when watching the film i really was imazed how the characters weren't troubled at all about the new information that would blow a normal person's mind. some people hate that lack of reality; the movie should not be watched with that kind of mood. Lady in the water is a piece of art, who looks at a picassos painting and hate it because of it's lack of reality, some people do but at the same time picasso is considered to be one of the greatest painter of all time. i think Shyamalan is one of the greatest directors and writers of present day, he has the courage to do something nobody else has. Im really sad lady in the water didn't pay off and i hope that doesn't discourage Shyamalan and wouldn't stop him from making another movie like this.to end my crappy review i would like to say that the soundtrack in this movie is gorgeous, really imazing.sorry my English",Lady in the Water
434,sdv30-1,Horrible - just horrible,1,20 December 2006,"all the people you see giving this movie a good review are hired by the producers of this movie. there is no other explanation. this movie is absolutely horrid. i just watched it on DVD and it took all i had not to claw my eyes out. the plot is laughable, paul giamatti makes a valiant effort in his role, but he has nothing to work with. i know many people will be seduced by shyamalan's name and will watch this movie anyway, and then you will come to the same conclusion as me. this is definitely one of the worst movies i have seen, and i have seen many bad movies. if this review makes one person not to waste their time and money on this drivel, it would be worth it. apart from giamatti, all the characters are so unlikable, you wish the big bad wolf would feast on them. at least that would be worth watching. shyamalan has completely lost it, and this movie proves it. it is really a shame, given the brilliance he displayed in ""the sixth sense"". but all his movies after that have been progressively worse and this one is so laughable, that one can only wonder what he will come up with next. again, don't fall for the morons giving this movie a good review. this is a terrible movie, and not in a good way.",Lady in the Water
435,Cosmic_Cre,An interesting premise that became a God awful movie.,2,20 April 2009,"How people can think this unforgivable mess of a movie is the be all and end all of cinematic excellence is beyond me. I won't stoop so low as to insult anyone for liking it. I may question their taste in movies though.Just so my review doesn't get lumped into a lot of the reviews on here, let me go on record by saying that...A)I'm not an M. Night Shamalayan hater. B)I wasn't expecting ""the twist"". C)The plot didn't ""go over my head"". D)I wasn't expecting a horror film. E)I don't had ADD. F)I don't hate nor fear originality. G)I didn't let the critics sway my decision. H)Fill in any other silly conspiracy theory for anyone not liking it here.Now, with that said, these were my problems with the movie and I'm going to explain this as calmly and respectfully as I possibly can...For a movie that is suppose to be a fantasy film, it was incredibly bland and not very fantastic at all. A film like this is suppose to give the viewer a sense of wonder, amazement and the anticipation of what's going to happen next. All this did was literally bore me to sleep and that has never happen to me before.A naked woman swimming in a pool at an apartment complex says her name is Story and she's a ""narf"" from The Blue World here to inspire a writer to write the book that will inspire a future president that will basically bring about world peace. Oh and there's a huge grass-wolf creature called a ""scrunt"" after her and a giant eagle she has to catch to get back to her world after she's done. Ummm... okay, that's all fine and good, but what truly bothers me is how the residences just automatically go along with this requiring no proof whatsoever.No one thinks she's possibly insane, on drugs or even does something as logical as calling the police. They just agree to help her, no questions asked. I know there has to be some suspension of disbelief here, but not so much that reason is completely abandoned. There has to be some kind of grounding in reality to make the fantasy aspects stand out. This is where the film loses me and fails to get me back because there's no recognizable human behavior to be found here.The pretentiousness and overall silliness is just too much to overlook and forgive. The whole film felt completely improvised, like M. Night pulled a bunch of stray ideas out of a hat, then strung them together without regard for logic, even internal logic. It had one bizarre, outlandish moment after another. As if the self-indulgent casting of himself as the gifted author who will inspire a future president wasn't bad enough, consider the scenes in which Story sits in a shower while all the other tenants stare at her as they try to find hidden messages in a crossword puzzle, where the little boy gets clues for helping her somehow by reading the sides of cereal boxes and of course, the blatantly obvious stab at his critics by turning one of them into scrunt chow. All of this is just beneath the dignity of a respectable filmmaker. With all that going on, how exactly are we suppose to take this movie as seriously as it takes itself?With that said, the movie wasn't a total disaster. I can admit that, yes, the premise was original, the score and the cinematography were beautiful and the actors, despite the horrendous dialog they were stuck with, gave it their all, but that in and of itself wasn't enough to consider this mess remotely ""inspirational"", ""brilliant"", or ""life-altering"". Originality without any sense of real direction is just a huge waste of time, energy, talent and celluloid for all involved.",Lady in the Water

This is definitely the worst movie I have seen since 'The Happening', I cant quite believe this movie was made, and for that it gets a one.The funny thing was I did not know that M.Night was the director to begin with... but slowly the picture began to emerge.. characters that would hardly make cannon fodder in any other film, bizarre references to the movie itself.. to the point where a character is jesting with the viewer about and immediately preceding his imminent demise, oh and what really gave M.

437,jkitts,"a wonderful, wonderful film",9,22 July 2006,"OK...enough of the M. Night bashing. This is a great movie that makes you THINK for a change. 98.9% of all movies made today lack this great quality. They visually treat you but do absolutely nothing for great discussion or moving you out of your comfort zone to think of areas that are important to your life and maybe even re-think those areas. This film does that, not since ""Saving Private Ryan"" have I enjoyed discussing a movie so much. This movie hits on certain levels that I wasn't prepared for. The level of involvement in other peoples lives to the extent that you think you know people you're around but never see the ""real"" gift of them. The level of faith or belief that one must have to continue life even when life is not kind and even downright cruel to you. The level of working together to achieve a greater goal, a goal that seems unobtainable and even unbelievable, but when factions of seeming different people from different backgrounds come together amazing results can happen. REMEMBER M. Night said this was a bedtime story for his kids... the story isn't that deep itself, but what is great and even better than ""Signs"", ""Unbreakable"", ""The Village"" is the development of the relationships between the characters, a depth that rings true to what's happening to the world right now in which we all live. What is lacking in our society is the hollowness and shallowness of relationships. This movie speaks to us in that vein, using a bedtime story to tell it. Great work Mr. Shyamalan.

I happened to like and appreciate the originality of his story concept. The film delivered in many ways and on many levels, blending heartfelt tale with reality w/funny lines/humor and fantasy. It's a gentle tale with a matrix of good vs evil and involving several archetypes. You're likely to like this film if you can handle Peter Pan and other fantasy. Acting was very good and that can't be easy for such a story/tale. The scope and variety of characters was impressive. As for the negative reviews. Don't bother with them.

439,janhatesmarcia,Shyamalan is having us on!,1,2 August 2006,"About 1/4-1/3 of the way through this movie I decided that Mr. Shyamalan was having us on. The clues are all there: the film critic (Bob Balaban) who describes film clichés (which are included in the movie), the over-the-top characters (who were mostly fun, actually--like ""Six Feet Under""'s Freddy Rodriguez playing a one-sided weight lifter), the ludicrous creature names (""scrunt"" ""narf""), the way every little thing was spelled out for the audience--even the name of the title character (""Story"").It was a bad sign from the very beginning of the film, when--with pseudo-primitive drawings--a narrator essentially tells us the entire plot of the film(!). There are some good actors totally wasted in this film, and that does NOT include the director himself, who, if he feels the need to appear in his own films, should limit that appearance to a brief Hitchcockian cameo.As my friend commented, Paul Giamatti (excellent actor that he is) looked at times as if he were wondering ""What on earth was I thinking!"" He is, however, very funny as the stuttering handyman in this apartment building of misfits.On the other hand, if Mr. Shyamalan was not having us on, then this is one of worst films I have ever seen. And, even if seen as satirical or ironic, the satire is so heavy-handed that I can only suppose the the director thinks film-goers are complete idiots.It's a shame, because ""Sixth Sense"" was so good, so original. Even ""Signs"" worked, for the most part. I walked into the theater with low expectations, but I still wasn't prepared for the laughable script and plot.There are no horror or thrills in this ""horror/thriller"" film.",Lady in the Water
440,fishbulb11,Great Film!,9,23 July 2006,"Once while studying theater I was told that in order for theater to work the audience had to give away their ideas of how the world works in order to buy into the reality of the show, this was called a...A Willing suspension of disbeliefThis translates into film as well. I mean audiences today are so used to checking reality at the door. Movies today, especially summer movies need to have big unbelievable things happen in order to get the audiences into the theaters. However, M Night Shymalan's films do something different. They challenge the audience to except the story being told in front of them as reality. Sure his films have dealt with Ghost, Superheroes, and Aliens but they all are grounded in reality, specifically our reality. I think this is actually why audiences have such a hard time with his films. In Lady in the Water he asks even more of his audience when he presents a fairy tale as something that could happen in our reality. The amazing part of it is, it works. This movie entertained me more than any other summer film so far. If I'm telling the truth it moved me emotionally more than Superman Returns. If I'm being even more honest I will admit that I actually had a few tears in the old eyes.Every single character in this film is rich in detail no matter how much time they have on screen. I felt like I knew them all. This is no surprise, as Shymalan always seems to care very much about every character.

441,xlined,The Lady In The Water,7,27 December 2006,"Before you watch this movie, you need to be prepared. The plot and its delivery are profoundly strange, but what's pretty incredible about this movie is that it's actually an allegory for the process of change in the world. New ideas and the changes that they bring about, especially ones that go in the face of common reasoning or social norms, require nourishment and support to be fully realized. Random yet critical events need to take place, and important individuals need to play out their roles without anyone having any true understanding of the overall picture. This movie shows us the doubt and confusion one faces in their quest to find out who they are and their purpose in life. In this movie, nobody is truly certain, and the obstacles they face are overwhelming. The characters take great leaps of faith in the name of the greater good, and when they do not succeed, they try and try again; exactly what people need to do in order to accomplish their dreams. This movie is even an allegory for its own self, because such an obviously bizarre movie would need exactly the kind of support and faith that its characters depict in order to be a success. I'd like to point out that the lady in the water's name is ""story"". I could go on and on, but I'd like to leave it at that.Overall, I absolutely love the true message of this movie and I found it wildly entertaining. Unfortunately, it's so bizarre that most people who don't want to take the time to understand it will be frustrated and think it's terrible. That's why I give it a 7 out of 10. This one needs an open mind, but M. Night Shyamalan keeps the hidden meanings in the foreground; all you have to do is pay attention and enjoy the show.",Lady in the Water
442,Favri,Still the worst film I've ever seen.,1,19 November 2013,"I had the pleasure of watching Lady in the water about a year after it came out. I say pleasure because after watching it I found comfort in the fact that I knew the odds of seeing a worse film decreased substantially. Admittedly, The Last Airbender and The Happening were serious contenders, but didn't quite have all the elements of awfulness that this little gem has. I don't enjoy bashing M Night. I studied The Sixth Sense and I am actually a big fan of Unbreakable, which I will happily watch whenever it's on. Why is this film so bad? Well, think of any reason which makes a film bad, and you wouldn't be wrong. The plot does not even attempt to engage you and is absolutely ridiculous - not in a ""oh that could never happen..."" kind of way (because let's be honest there are plenty of unrealistic good movies, that's hardly a flaw in itself) but in a ""why have you written this ridiculous pointless ting"" kind of way. The characters are... nothing. That's what they are. They barely fit the definition of characters. They are not explored, they have no journey, they just happen to be fictional and in a ""film"". As many people do, I really like Paul Giammatti. I mean, he's an excellent actor with an impressive range. He is does comedy as well as he does drama. I really can't go on enough as to how good he is. Barney's Version being a just one example of his talent. So, this film is redeemed by an excellent performance by good ol' Paulie, you are thinking, with new found hope! No. I am surprised he has left this film out there to be seen. Don't get me wrong, he is still a good actor in it, he's a professional at the end of the day. It's that the rest of this film is so bad that it crushes his good work. So sorry, I realise I've written so much and not even told you what the film is about! So, there's a water nymph that lives in a swimming pool of a crappy motel, that needs to go home. Oh, OK, you're thinking, that doesn't sound bad at all! OK. How about no context at all is given and all the questions you have won't be answered. Not enough? OK, how about we throw in a very unsubtle dig at film critics by... putting a bad person who is a film critic in the film in quite a pointless role. Just to be sure, let's throw in some entirely pointless characters like a guy who has one hugely developed muscular arm. I won't ""spoil"" the end for you, not just because M Night does an excellent job of that himself and I could never compete. What I can say is it will make you angry, make you wonder if any thought whatsoever was put into this, make you question why you even bothered watching this thing and whether you should ever watch anything again. Ever. It may even make you question life itself. Then, that's where the magic happens. That is when you will realise that you've seen and touched the bottom of film making. And that is where you will find comfort and reassurance, eventually realising that anything else you watch after this will be better.",Lady in the Water
443,wozza10,The audacity of the man,1,26 August 2006,"M Night Shyamalaan is an excellent film-maker. OK, the twist in The Village was obvious after minutes, but it was a film that did not deserve some of the lashings it received. But 'Lady In The Water' is a different story. It is a film that fails in everything it's trying to be.Primarily it's trying to be a family, fantasy adventure movie and I cannot imagine what kind of child (the primary audience for this genre) is not going to be bored out of their mind from the off. The reason it fails is Night and Night alone. Again he has made a slow burning dialogue heavy movie set completely in ""reality"". Where this film should be bright, lively, fun, exciting, magical it is instead dull (this is the worst work Chris Doyle's done), lifeless, turgid, bland and, dare I say, boring. The world of the movie is inappropriate for the genre it's living in.The reason that this style doesn't work is that the whole point of the movie is that's it's a fantastical bedtime story, yet it's devoid of anything fantastical. This film should be set in a world like ours, but not ours. Night - not everything in your imagination can happen in Philadelphia! This movie also feels like it's only ever gone thru two drafts. First draft was a straight up bedtime story which Night has read back and realised ""man, this doesn't work... at all. It's terrible"" so he's written in a whole layer of character (allegedly... horrifically inaccurate caricature's more accurate) and dialogue who are there solely to justify how bad some things are. sadly he doesn't seem to have read draft 2 to realise that the layers justifying how rubbish everything is are even worsely executed meaning the script is two layers of $h1t on top of each other.And then you have the complete audacity of the man in casting himself as the man who will (essentially) write the second bible. This would be ego gone insane if he was actually any good, but his performance is the one in the movie that really isn't anywhere near what it needs to be. There's a moment when the character finds out what his fate will be, a scene which an actor of quality would have been able to wrench your heart with, but a moment where Night actually looks like he's realised the film he's made could destroy his career (although I hope not)! Man, I could go on and on from the backstory being explained to you chunk at a time for no reason other than to flesh out the idea beyond what it ever deserved in such a way that it feels like Night's rewriting the rules of his own film as he goes because he's never had any solid idea of what the rules are at the start to the film critic who's only film criticism is ""it sucked"" which instantly destroys the attempt to set him up as an arrogant highbrow critic (he also gets possibly the worst cinematic death ever) to how blatantly obvious the red herrings are.I genuinely cannot see what anyone can see positively about this movie (as a whole), unless they are so sure Night's a genius they cannot see beyond the name to the film that's actually there.",Lady in the Water
444,cbrunson100,another Shyamalan winner,7,24 January 2007,"My lovely bride chose LITW from Netflix and I chose 'Eraserhead,' and we watched them together within a few days. We liked LITW much more because LITW tells you what it is, a bedtime story. It's also a movie you can appreciate as superficially or as deeply as you desire to go (I watched 'Eraserhead' three times and still don't understand what D. Lynch was trying to do/say to the viewer, and neither does anyone else if you read its reviews). It's clear from the beginning that LITW is a fable. 'How can a woman live under a swimming pool?' you ask. It's a fairy tale and that means things like that can happen. I have liked all Shyamalan's movies so far and this is another one I liked very much. His movies make it easy to suspend your sense of disbelief and are very satisfying even though you know there's going to be a twist or two before the end. I appreciated particularly the revelations of the Defender, Guild, Healer and Interpreter and the twists when we find that the original choices were all the wrong choices. I thought the film critic's demise in the hallway was funny and brilliantly tongue-in-cheek. Even if you write off the mythology of the narf and the scrunt and the tartuca (or whatever) and the giant eagle, the story of the building residents was funny and entertaining on its own. Yes, the characters might have been a little thin for some film devotees, but the storytelling (which is the essence of movie-making) was terrific. Interpreting the universe by reading cereal boxes was great. It was funny and unexpected. And while it is far-fetched, is it any more ridiculous than reading tarot cards or tea leaves or palms? Paul Giamatti was very good in the movie. Sure, it was formulaic; in the beginning he's scared (of life and the past as well as the scrunts) and by the end he has the courage and resolve of ten men, but he was believable even if the situations wasn't. My wife and I don't always agree on movies but we both thought this was a good one.",Lady in the Water

446,KyleWest,Absolutely Awful,1,26 July 2006,"Think back...remember how M. Night's movies throw you off by giving you a crazy ending or an unlikely outcome. Usually leaving you severely disappointed...Well, this movie for a change doesn't have one of the key aspects. It doesn't have the part of the movie that makes sense and that is enjoyable. This movie is the disappointment ending of the village and unbreakable for almost two hours. The film is filled with cheesy dialogue, unlikely scenarios (everyone in the building believing in this water land fiasco) and last but not least...a plot that isn't horrible. M. Night has skills as a director, you can tell by the way the film looks.....But nothing on two feet could've made such a silly screenplay into a work of art...Narfs, evil monkey like creatures with sticks in their heads, guilds, guardians, healers... Ignore all positive reviews, because this movie sucks.",Lady in the Water
447,urthstripe321,His best since The Sixth Sense.,8,19 July 2006,"I saw this movie at a free pre-screening in Atlanta, and I have to say I was a bit surprised by how good this movie was. I am a fan of all of his movies, they are unique works that you don't find very often in the movie market. That being said, Lady in the Water fits his profile and improves drastically on it. It's his most simple, most straightforward, and it is compelling and beautiful. It's a modern day fairy tale set in an ordinary place, where the mundane blurs together with the extraordinary, and the people are willing to accept it, because they miss the day when the impossible was as close as your thoughts. It's sad, but not melancholy like his previous film, The Village, or even Signs, it's hopeful, it's funny (hilarious in many parts), and it may very well be his best since The Sixth Sense. He's made quite a step forward with this film, and I look forward to what next he has in store. Highly recommended.",Lady in the Water
448,edbelcher-2,M. Night Shyamalan fan not very impressed,6,22 July 2006,"I am a big M. Night Shyamalan fan who respects and enjoys his personal revivification of the Twilight Zone era story telling genre. The Rod Serling influence is evident in his grand story telling technique that is usually punctuated with a bait and switch revelation moment of true insight (what I term as the cold-chill moment).M. Night is unlike most of the ""Hollywood suck-up types"" because of his willingness to take creative chances with his story telling regardless of whether or not the story seems formulaic enough for potential box-office gold.Having said that, I think his latest endeavor has much to be desired. First of all I must agree with a previous member who said his role in the movie went a little overboard. It is fine when he has a cameo appearance but in this movie, his character role was a little distracting. I kept hearing people whisper... ""that is M. Night."" And ""By the way, did you know that is M. Night?"" However, I can not criticize his actual acting ability since it was good.The other point that became a little drawn out and predictable was the way the characters had been mistakenly identified... Movie viewers know what I am talking about here. The ""guardian"" turned out to not really be the guardian, and the ""healer"" wasn't really the ""healer"" and so forth. The misidentification of roles theme got a little old really quick.All in all the acting was very believable especially by Giamatti. However, from an entertainment value standpoint, I was a bit disappointed with the movie. I felt the movie was a little on the long side. It is very unusual for me to watch the clock at any M. Night movie.Considering all the negatives I was put in the unfortunate position where I was happy to finally say: ""the eagle has landed!"" Movie viewers understand and know the pun was intended.",Lady in the Water
449,marknovack,Yet another miss from the same.,4,28 October 2006,"Contrived. Motionless. Impossibly false characters. Boring. Without reason. A 10 minute movie packed into 105 minutes. So much for the story line. The director's name is the first that appears in the closing...nice of him to remind the viewer of who is responsible for the outcome.Mechanically, the movie is well filmed, well edited (I guess), and looks decent on screen. Paul Giamatti is a fine actor who deserves much better writing for his talents.This is the third film by this director that I have seen and they are all too similar in format for my taste. The dialog is performed with a ""who cares"" feeling, almost like the director filmed the cuts before the actors were awake. Monotone lines, an inflatable date has more passion within.",Lady in the Water
450,GSiessel,This is NOT a Horror Movie,8,9 January 2007,"Most people were disappointed because this movie was more of a Fairy Tale than a Horror Movie, the trailers making the film portrayed as such. That may have been the fault of the studio/advertsers. I don't believe M.Night wanted this to be a horror flick. Basically he has created a Fairy Tale with his classic twist.The story deals with an apartment super discovering a mysterious woman in the complex's swimming pool. She turns out to be a creature from the ""Blue World"" (listen carefully to the prologue to understand this). She needs to contact special humans in order to return to her world. Other creatures wish for her NOT to return and will try to stop her at all costs. M.Night weaves a new approach to a scenario where the humans in the apartment complex learn to become their true potential in solving this ""otherworld"" mystery. Don't be put off by this being a Fairy Tale (it might be too scary to young kids) and look at HOW the story unfolds.",Lady in the Water
451,tda-2,Fantasy filled with humor and good acting,5,21 July 2006,"I understand this movie is not for everyone. Night's movies take their time to reach the end. Sublety is a gift that he continues to use and some people may find it to slow. However the plot is unique and interesting. Characters are thrown in with purpose and the acting is solid. I only wish there could have been more of Bryce Dallas Howard. Fleshing out her background might have helped. It is shot wonderfully and you feel these fantastic things could be happen anywhere. Bringing out the ""rules"" in humorous scenes were a great way not to have it not become too cheesy. And finally the visuals were very good. As much as I like the sublety in Night's movies it's more satisfying to actually see the monsters. And see them we do. The shots of the wolf creature were perfect not only in realism but in the angles that they shot it with. Overall a very wonderful movie. I don't understand most of the complaints against it. Perhaps they are just to cynical...the movie after all is about hope.",Lady in the Water
452,david-1639,Water Torture,1,14 August 2006,"Let me start off by saying I love fantasy films and was more than prepared to accept the world created in this movie. I have a very vivid imagination and am not at all cynical towards films of this ilk. For those wondering I felt it necessary to say that as those who defend this film always seem to accuse those who disliked it of lacking those sensibilities. I hated this film. It was boring, pretentious, self glorifying rubbish. The dialogue was poor and the pacing dreadful. I did like the scrunts (wolf like creatures) I only wish that they had been those we do not speak of in The Village, then that movie might not have sucked quite as much as it did. If its a good fun fantasy flick you're after go and see the superior in every way Monster House.",Lady in the Water
453,chadsarah,What an Enchanting Film,8,3 August 2006,"In a time where many of our movies are remakes, adaptations and/or sequels, I am always looking for an original film based solely on an artist's imagination. M. Night Shyamalan makes these kinds of films and is an artist I anticipate because he delivers. LADY IN THE WATER is a bedtime story, a fantasy film. I find it difficult to understanding why so many people are so vehemently attacking this story. If you intend to watch it with an expectation that it's suppose to scare you or surprise you with some amazing twist, you will probably be disappointed (but this is not the film's fault.) Critics who write that the film's plot is preposterous seem to think fairy tales have to conform to realism; all this proves to me is that they lack an imagination. What we have here is a fable, a magical one that left me inspired and thoroughly entertained. Paul Giamatti's work is incredible (as always) and the rest of the cast was equally committed and believable. If you like movies full of magic, parables layered in metaphor, I highly recommend this film. So far I have yet to see a movie this summer so deserving of my time and money.Note: Some seem to think it awful that Mr. Shyamalan casts himself in his film, proving in their eyes he has some giant ego-- which if he has is irrelevant. Why is this so repugnant? Woody Allen casts himself in his movies all the time. Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, Kevin Smith and countless other directors act in their movies. Yet Mr. Shyamalan does this and is considered a loon. I might agree with this critique if he was a horrible actor but as a supporting character he is quite effective.",Lady in the Water

What i got was something rather wonderful (and in this age of computer generated re-runs of tired story lines)- a rare thoughtful film that appealed to more than just the groin or was aimed at an audience with an attention span of less than two seconds. It is a film that is, in the main, well acted and really well directed (i loved some of the camera angles). This is a gem that does not deserve the criticism or the low mark it gets here. I am sure it will gain cult status. Yes, it has its faults. Some of the scenes are uneven as is some of the acting from secondary characters (the director included) But the overall effect is to lift the soul....and that, sadly, is an increasingly rare event these days.",Lady in the Water

Village was a let down and I am thankful that he actually pushed out another great movie. I went to see it thinking it would be entertaining to watch but not much more. I walked out of the theater still in awe on how well the movie thrilled and entertained. He thrilled, scared, and kept myself and the audience on edge during this great adaptation to this international folk-lore!! I think people will watch this and next week it will have more viewers and a bigger impact to the amount of money it makes. I actually cannot wait for his next movie to come out!!",Lady in the Water
456,the_scandal_cha,"I know I am in the minority here, but I enjoyed it",8,22 July 2006,"First off, I can see why this film is going to be a box-office flop and why critics and audiences alike will not like it. I, who usually disagrees with most audiences, at least, thoroughly enjoyed this film. The storyline itself is rather ridiculous, I must say. Some girl shows up in a pool? She's a what-a narf? I went into the movie thinking I would hate it, but I came out knowing that I had seen a work of art. That's right. It was art.First of all, it's a good family film, with enough tense moments to keep you watching, and enough laugh-out-loud moments to calm you down. It was refreshing for once to see a film with good, clean humour. The dialogue was not necessarily hilarious, but the actors, especially Paul Giamatti (Cleveland) delivered the lines extremely well.The acting was tremendously well done also. Paul Giamatti is always fantastic, and while Bryce Dallas Howard seemed to act in the same manner as she did in The Village, she was still convincing. The ensemble cast worked well together. Some might bash M. Night for casting himself in a not-so-cameo role, but he proved that he can actually act! No, his performance will not win him an Oscar, nor should it, but I think there is definite talent there. I hope to see him in bigger roles, in films not his own.The plot had many twists, maybe too many, but no matter. I kept trying to guess what was going to happen, but it I was always wrong. It was quite interesting.What most made this film a work of art was the directing. M. Night has a rare talent that will go completely under the radar for this film because no one will see it. The camera angles were inventive-that's right, inventive. I may be one of the few who actually cares about camera angles and how a scene looks, but it looked great. The final product was polished.I truly believe this film is M. Night's best work. He made the story up himself, wrote a screenplay that made us laugh, smile, cringe, and jump just a little, and directed a great ensemble cast including himself. Quite a feat. So before everyone starts ranting about how stupid the storyline is or how ""so-not-scary"" the film is, just appreciate the uniqueness of the film, and remember what makes this film good. Forget the crazy story. It's everything else!",Lady in the Water
457,CybaGirl,Awesome Movie Totally Loved It.,10,18 December 2006,"Just finished watching it and thought the movie was just so beautiful. The music, the depth and understanding of ones purpose was just lovely to see in this movie. It sure makes a lovely change to most of the garbage that seems to be coming out of Hollywood these days. So thank you very much Mr M. Night Shyamalan for a wonderful and heart warming movie.Furthermore, it's not very often I will watch a movie twice. Yet I am pleased to say that Lady in the Water and Flyboys are just two movies I will be watching again.I wouldn't worry about the uneducated and microscopic minded critics who claim this movie is terrible. They can't help not having any understanding of what this movie is about anymore than having a brain inside of their heads.

I believe in something, that we got to have a grownup mind and a heart of a child, if we loose this, we die inside. You see, when we grownup we start to worry with material stuffs, money, and we forgot how to live, and that ( and it is necessary, money ) consume us, bring out the very worst in us. And life start to provoke situations to remind us that, that we need balance. This movie was that for me, a very nice way to show this balance, that we have to stop thinking only in ourselves and start thinking in others. OK, he had not need to use a critic for that, to show the selfish side. He could use another form. But, a lot of them have fall into the net. I thought it was a difficult theme, a theme that a lot of us want to hide, the purpose, the believing, the stop thinking in ourselves. If you do not have this feeling inside, the feeling of help others, you will not care for this movie, otherwise, it is a masterpiece !!!Cheers !",Lady in the Water
459,castanza_91-1,'Lady' Drips Magic and Wonder,7,21 July 2006,"Words cannot express how skeptical I was about M. Night Shyamalan's new feature Lady in the Water. Everyone single one of his near perfect movies have been on my top ten list of the year it came out. Lady in the Water is no exception. The twist we are all used to by Shyamalan is not present, but that does not stop Lady in the Water from being a thoughtful and magical experience.M. Night Shyamalan pulls away from his usual horror/thriller movie formula and brings us into the world of Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). A superintendent at an apartment complex called The Cove and feels like life is fixing tenants problems and managing the very hectic place. This all changes one night when a young woman emerges from the pool. She calls herself Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) and asks for him to take her back home to the Blue World. She is a Narf (spelling?) whose job is to find a writer to help her. Once she finds him, she can then return to the Blue World.Things don't seem as easy as Cleveland thought when menacing creatures called Scrunts prevent her from going back to her world. They can camouflage into the grass and appear as wolves. Cleveland finds out from a Chinese woman and her party happy daughter that Story is from an eastern bedtime story. He spends the rest of his time finding out how to beat the Scrunts and gather a group of chosen people to get Story back home.Believe it or not but M. Night Shayamalan created this bedtime story himself, and he used to tell it to his kids. The big screen adaptation of his story is very well written and flows well. Not only that but it's one of the first of his movies where I laughed my head off. He mixes intrigue with humor perfectly. There are a couple of spots where you may be misled and the ending felt a little weak with the amount of repetitiveness it went through. That didn't stop me from feeling complete in the way it was so magical and creative.I predict that many people will find this movie incredibly dull since it was marketed the wrong way, as with Shyamalan's earlier project The Village. It is not a horror, nor is it a thriller. Sure, I jumped in my seat once or twice and there are some times of suspense but I clearly state that this is a full-fledged fantasy movie. Lady in the Water is a movie about learning who we are and what are part is in this ugly world. This is a message that will prove hard for many to understand and find in this movie. That is what Shyamalan is about and he has hidden these types of meaningful messages in all his masterpieces. Paul Giamatti maybe new too acting in a whimsical type picture but he is just excellent here. I can say the exact same thing about Ron Howard's daughter, Bryce Dallas Howard. They have amazing chemistry and they just look so great on screen. The other actors are fun but some can be a little stale. The most comical character is a snobby pretentious know-it- all film critic who suffers the complete opposite of a fairy tale ending. That is going to make many critics cringe in anger. The only character I felt stupefied with is a young man who's only working out one side of his body, played by Freddy Rodriguez. This wasn't funny, or very original. Lady in the Water is one of Shyamalan's best works and I know there are a lot of ticked off people who would be happy to debate with me. You'll leave the movie theater with a smile on your face and you'll feel cheerfully delighted. Now another long wait ensues for M. Night Shyamalan's next movie. Oh man.",Lady in the Water

I mean what the hell ""some crazy lady shows up in a pool naked and wants to change the world"" ..but people took it seriously.

461,sdb_1970,First of his films that I have found to be disappointing,6,23 July 2006,"I was not a big fan of M. Night Shyamalan out of the gate. In the waning months of the summer of 1999, I was far more impressed with a pre-hype showing of 'Blair Witch Project' than the somewhat predictable debut, 'The Sixth Sense.' Maybe timing is everything. Nonetheless, although 'The Sixth Sense' was hardly a disappointment, I was far, far more impressed with 'Unbreakable,' 'Signs,' and 'The Village.' In my opinion, 'The Sixth Sense' is one of those films that is completely driven by plot, with very little character. These are the types of films that often drive box office revenues and serve the viewer who simply wants to be entertained. But with each of Shyamalan's successive films, fans of 'The Sixth Sense' have become more and more disillusioned with the writer/director. For me and a lot of viewers however, his characters have become richer, and even if the plots have become sloppier and sloppier, at least the works have become more thematic.With 'Lady in the Water', the theme is a significant one - power of storytelling, but the film itself ends up being nothing more than a relatively unaffected exercise in meta-storytelling. Shyamalan can build a wonderful plethora of characters in the first 30 minutes of the film, but he cannot inject them into the mythology he is trying to create in any convincing or meaningful way. Shyamalan has made the grave error of assuming that we will accept this mythology without him doing the hard work as director and writer. Combined with a marked increase in Shyamalan's own screen time (well beyond his signature cameo role), the film drips with hubris of the type of a talented filmmaker who has finally come to believe his own hype. I truly hope that he will come back down to earth for his next film and go back to writing and filming great stories instead of writing and filming stories about stories, neither of which are convincing.",Lady in the Water
462,dsnicol,A work of philosophy - not horror,9,21 June 2007,"This film is just a bit too intellectually complex for many people to appreciate. For those who can see the eternal and profound real-world significance of the political and philosophical aspects of Lucas' Star Wars saga, this film should be amply rewarding and a pleasure to watch.The story unfolds more like a fable of Aesop rather than a 'scary movie', and shows the interconnectedness of people based upon their separate and unique abilities. This opposes the modern cultural myth that we are all the same and basically equal. Instead, by people having and lacking abilities, we are drawn together to pursue the Good because we need each person's separate abilities to accomplish our goals.This film has some wonderful performances, and should quicken the heart of any person who has kept theirs alive within this world of cold stone we inhabit. Not a perfect film by any means, yet the imperfections should not diminish the impact on the open-hearted viewer in any way.",Lady in the Water
463,edenhall,Not at all what I expected,10,22 July 2006,"When I first thought about seeing this, I told my friend, ""What a stupid idea - a movie about a fairy tale."" M. Night had noted that this movie did not have twists, which turned out to be true. I must say that the movie was absolutely awesome. M. Night is a genius. I was so shocked to had liked this movie because from an outside view it is so ridiculous. A woman in the water seeking help to return to her world after her mission in the real world has been complete - it seems absolutely crazy. However, after watching the movie, I loved it. Definitely one of my favorite. You need to realize that this movie is, in a blunt sense, a fairy tale that takes place in modern times. The movie does exactly so. M.

The elaborate mythology outlined by M. Night Shyamalan is wonderfully weaved. The funny and complex main character is given a sudden blast of responsibility when Story, a Narf from the Blue World, appears in the Pool. The film has deeply terrifying moments, scarier than any horror movie I've seen this summer. (much scarier than The Decent.) The film also has a lot of heart and deep emotion. I'd say that the only thing that keeps this film from a 10 is the fact that the ending seemed to stop short of where the film felt like it should have ended. It would be great if the end would've dragged out a bit longer. Otherwise, this whimsical film is top-notch. One of the best this summer.",Lady in the Water
465,johnstoa,A great new genre for Shymalan,10,26 July 2006,"Lady in the Water is one of those movies that you will either love or hate depending on what you are expecting from the director. Previously, all M Knight movies have been thrillers with fantastic twists that leave the general audience in awe and frightened or enlightened. Lady in the Water does not have a twist which may leave you feeling cheated. However, taking the movie for what it is without trying to figure it out makes you walk out of the theatre having seen a truly excellent movie with a great plot that allows us all to go back to the fantasy of old bedtime stories and actually believe it for the 2 hours you are watching it. The characters are all unique and beautiful (character development always being a great talent of his) and the mystery and fantasy of the story leaves you feeling inspired and lifted or dare I say ""awake""? The Cinematography and the sound editing is superb giving excitement, humor, suspense, and illumination all when it is needed.

467,xlivestrong32,Big Bad Wolf,8,21 July 2006,"Good job, M Night! Lady in the Water was very good, appealing to the eye.I just came home from seeing it, so it should be fresh in my mind. Okay, the movie starts with introducing the movie critic Mr Parker by Cleveland to Reggie, the guy who works out ONE side of his body. One night, Cleveland hears splashing in the water (it's after 7pm, no swimming at the Cove after 7!) and who is it, you might ask? The lady in the water, silly! Cleveland proposes this mysterious lady, Story, to be a narf, and asks the Oriental university student what a narf is. She explains its a bedtime story, but has to ask her mom for the story. So, it turns out for the narf to return, she has to be taken by this huge eagle. But, there is a scrunt who is trying to prevent the narf to be taken back. The narf who is chosen to be taken outside the Blue World (they place where they hail from) is called the Madam Narf.Cleveland asks Mr Parker about how to piece together a plot before the story is over. Mr Parker explains each character as Cleveland explains them. So, Cleveland sets out to find the Guild, Interpreter and Guardian by assuming each character is a tenant of the Cove.The first time Cleveland tries to get Story back to the Blue World, is during a party, and it goes horribly wrong because who he has assumed to be the characters is wrong, wrong wrong! One part during the party where some of the Guild members left their ""post"", Story is dragged into the woods by the scrunt. She is found unconscious by Cleveland and then the rest of the movie goes on by showing how Cleveland tries to re-find each character of the story.Finally, they all get it right and she is taken by the giant eagle to go back to the Blue World!

From the beginning i didn't expect them to like it and I suspect many of them didn't. At the end of the movie I kept my post-viewing ""glee"" to myself and agreed with the crowd ""Oh yeah, that was OK"". Around this time I found out that many people actually hated the movie. They said it was way too far-fetched and ""the monsters"" didn't look real. 1--- WHAT DID THEY SUSPECT from a movie that is A BEDTIME STORY by M. Night. 2-- HOW ARE MONSTERS SUPPOSED TO LOOK REAL? At no point in time is the movie set up to be convincingly realistic. THis movie was a unique twist on all of the tales we hear as children. A movie does not need to be a cartoon to be far-fetched.Personally, I LOVED this movie. It made me happy, it made me sad, it scared me and most importantly it made me think. M. Night is a master story teller. Don't let the slew of poor reviews mislead you. Most critics are advising normal movie goers who judge a movie at the surface and quite frankly don't know what the hell they are talking about. Just because there wasn't an awesome chase scene, heart felt love scene or a politically charged message doesn't make this movie anything less than its mainstream counterparts. The only flaw in the movie was the ending. I feel it was way too quiet and would have a more powerful effect in a theatre that wasn't crowded with over caffeinated youth. So if you were to ask me ""Should i go see this movie?"" I would reply with another question. What kind of movie viewer are you? Do you like a simple story that follows the heavily treaded path of most movies, or do you enjoy something different. Something that boldly goes out on the limb to try something different. SOmething that has never been done before. If you are this type of person, this movie is highly recommended, if not don't bother the trip out to the theater, Turn on the TV and watch prime time sitcoms. Someone has to appreciate mediocre films (so stick with whats tried in true). SOmeone also has to be here to appreciate true art and its that person that will love this film.

The movie was not that scary but the parts that were scary were kinda intense. GREAT FILM!",Lady in the Water
471,milamontagne,"An awesome fantasy, whether your a child or adult.",9,29 July 2006,"This movie, as another reviewer has pointed out, is excellent if you go into it expecting it to be a child's bedtime story. In that regard, it exceeds expectations. Plenty of tongue-in-cheek moments (The best would have to be the film critic's fate :P ) Many have commented on the plot as being absurd or unbelievable. To this, i would ask the question: Just how absurd are many of the fairy tales you heard as a child? This movie brings out what we see little of in Hollywood: Imagination on the part of the watcher. The movie, to the right kind of person, leave's you wondering about much that you weren't told. What of Story's 'Blue World'? What of the writer? The film does an excellent job of calling to the fantasy-you-would-love-to-believe part of you. In closing, I would hope that this kind of movie catches on.",Lady in the Water
472,bluewolf222,Did I miss something? Was this supposed to be terrible?,7,28 July 2009,"I am a fan of M. Night Shyamalan's. When he was announced as director of ""The Last Airbender"", I was excited, but had only seen three of his movies, so I have been watching his films, starting with ""The Sixth Sense"", in order of release. When I got to this one, I prepared myself for a movie along the lines of Steven Spielberg's ""Hook"", one with some good elements, but overall disappointing. Instead, I got a rather entertaining movie. First, what this film keeps consistent with in terms of M. Night's other films is the beautiful cinematography, lead acting, and the music score. I cannot emphasize enough how amazing James Newton Howard's score for this movie is. M. Night's supporting role in this did not bother me. It wasn't Oscar-worthy, but not like, as one reviewer said, ""pouring petrol over your head and lighting it"". The movie is too well-acted by the main leads to be considered crap, and the suspense is effective, if not nearly as good as in M. Night's other films. A common complaint I have heard is that the characters believe in the fantastical part of the story too easily, but I disagree. I think they simply put their trust in a man (Cleveland) who has basically taken care of them for years at The Cove, despite how ridiculous it may have seemed. Also, isn't it better to skip over every scene of Cleveland trying to convince everyone that this woman he has met is from another world? The bottom line is that you will not enjoy the movie (or probably any of M. Night's films) without suspending your disbelief a lot, which I simply happen to be good at. If you disliked this movie along with M. Night's next movie, I remind you that the greatest filmmakers always make at least one bad movie. Spielberg has ""1941"" and ""Hook"". Shyamalan, if you like, has this and ""The Happening"".",Lady in the Water
473,opallu,See this original movie,10,6 August 2006,"Terrific movie, original, well cast, well filmed, doesn't fit into any category out there. It is beginning to seem like the whole country is determined to punish M. Night for controlling his product, for having an individual vision rather than a collaborative one, and sticking to it. That is the very thing that makes his movies so interesting, even the filming in Pennsylvania is an intriguing characteristic of his work, although I am sure it is one of the things the for which the industry is punishing him. The opening tells us that this is a children's story, pretty much about good vs evil and visually suggests that the people from the water are like angels. The whole plot is laid out right there; the depiction of it in character, in dialog, in camera shots, is compelling to the very end. I think the monkey creatures are hokey but the other concepts are in the best of story-telling traditions. I even like the way M. Night summarily dealt with critics. His appearance in his own movie is appealing too. Go to see this movie and keep something different coming to the mainstream cinema.",Lady in the Water

Basically, there is a ""narf"" that has came from the ""blue world"" that comes out of the pool one night, and she is trying to return home, but there are certain obstacles in her way.If you liked Shyamalan ""Signs"" that he made earlier, then your sure to enjoy this, it is a great film and worth every one of the 7 stars that i gave it. The ending as well i loved, when every one in the apartments had a purpose, and it all came together.It wasn't until the middle of the film that i started getting into it so it is a slow starter, but doesn't leave you disappointed at the end.If your not one for far fetched films, then i wouldn't recommend this to you.

Night Shyamalan since Sixth Sense, but it seems that over time, with the exception of The Village (which was a brief upward blip), each film has generally gone downhill. This latest film is no exception. First of all, it's hard to follow, and I'm a pretty smart guy. Second, the plot drags on for most of the film, and really doesn't take the viewer much of anywhere. As a matter of fact, one is left with a feeling of ""That's it?!?"" after the film is done. Spoiler alert: Bryce Dallas Howard is a fictional creature who has to brave dogs made of grass to inspire Mr. Shyamalan to write some life-changing work? Perhaps even he sees what many of his viewers are starting to see: That his works of late lack inspiration, let alone the thrills, chills and plot twists that accompanied his first film. Maybe someone can reach into this movie, retrieve his fable nymph, and bring her into his real life to inspire him to write something more worthy of him than this drabble. Until then, I fear we're due another film from him that will only continue the trend he's been on.",Lady in the Water

Since then however although the concepts of his movies tend to be continually thought-provoking and do contrast to the typical Hollywood movies currently being churned out at increasingly alarming rates. I found I was rather let down with this offering. It didn't have that great twist and wow factor that the sixth sense had. Nor did I leave the cinema thinking 'value for money' because it wasn't. Bryce Dallas Howard's performance was more disappointing than her performance in The Village...'Yawn'. The plot although interesting was predicable as I figured out the 'twist' half way through the movie, from which point I lost interest and would have walked out of the theatre had it not been for the good acting from Giamatti and the scenes with the funny Young-Soon Choi and her mother.

They could not have chosen a better actress to play the character called Story, she's outstanding. Me and my friend talked about maybe having Cate blanchett in the roll, but she would only be ""lady in the woods"". Bryce Dallas Howard was the perfect choice.Paul Giamatti is also perfect for his role, acting a tormented, quiet, yet caring building-manager. Everything is this movie, the different characters, the scenery and the pace could not have been done any better.Definitely one of the better movies i've seen this year and it was easily worth 8 Euros to see it. It was 110 well spent minutes.The only thing that stops me from giving it a 10/10, is that the ending is abit to emotional for me.And one more thing.

Yes, there are some scary moments, but the theme is not one of horror stories. I felt like this movie was more like his older one, Wide Awake (which I also highly recommend), but from someone now more experienced and who has refined his story-telling skills.I applaud you M. Night Shyamalan. I had others tell me they didn't like Lady in the Water. I LOVED it.

I paid to see this film and i would list it as the worst movie experience ever. It was such a low budged boring film that should not have been advertised and trailer-edited as an entertaining film. All the actors are uglier than the beast that certainly created by some amateur CG animator. They all acted overwhelmingly like a bunch of soap opera extras. The cinematography was totally outdated trash. I had seen ""the sign"" and ""village"", both are not so good but ""lady"" simply was the worst golden strawberry-like example. Thanks for all the effort by the director,I yelled""MONEY BACK"" when the film finished in cinema and lots of people agreed. Go back to film school and re-shape yourself,Night!",Lady in the Water
481,longjohnslass,I wouldn't say Night is egotistical...,9,28 June 2013,"OK, true. It's NOT a very fast-paced film, and the details of the ""Bedtime Story"" are a bit far-fetched, but bear in mind - this movie is based off a story Night created for his own children. Being able to take something meant for that initial target audience, and turn it into a movie meant for a world of viewers seems like quite a task, don't you think? And something that kind of rubs me the wrong way, is how so many people seem to like attacking Night for his own role in the film. Now, I'm not out to bash anyone's opinion here, I'm just stating my own! But all this talk of self-righteousness and pride seem a tad harsh to me. I never saw it in that light until I heard other people start going on about it. What MY interpretation of his character was, even if you have very notable viewpoints on things, it most often takes some sort of big event (like a tragedy) to get anyone's attention before they'll even consider what you have to say. Especially if, as he said, it's opinions about leaders and political problems. His character says, ""I'm not anything, you know. I don't think I'm anything special""... ""I don't know who's going to want to publish the thing""... ""How is this gonna happen? Why are people gonna start taking me seriously?"" As kids, we're often brought up to dream big and reach of limitless possibilities (It isn't until adulthood that the hardships of life start to really beat us down and try to put us in our place). And since this WAS originally a story for Night's daughters, I can easily see that he would be going for such a message, and thus: it makes sense that he should want to play the role himself. And who knows? Maybe he wanted to steer away from cameos and just TRY being a full character for once. Seems like as good a time as any.Trying anything for the first time is always a risk, especially in Hollywood. The movie world is savagely critical and unforgiving. But I think this was a beautiful movie with more going for it than a lot of people notice. I think it was well-cast, there's a good amount of humor throughout, and as always James Newton Howard delivers a wonderful, heart-felt score. The only thing I can see wrong with this movie is the advertising. I don't think it should have been labeled as a ""scary movie"" or ""thriller"" or whichever Night was going for. Because that would only further disappoint a lot of people. Shots of a woman by a pool in nothing but a shirt in a film pegged as ""scary"" leads to some expectations, doesn't it? When I went to see this in theaters, there was a group of guys in the very back row who were NOT pleased when they left. Clearly, they'd received the wrong impression.",Lady in the Water

It was serendipitous that I even got it - Netflix sent it by accident, but I was so pleasantly surprised! Approach this movie with an open mind; see it as a child would hear a bedtime story (as that is what it is). It's sort of silly, yes, but it's wonderful, and it's nice seeing a movie that has such a hopeful message. Approach this movie without super-high expectations, and you won't be disappointed.

483,philosopher-8,Only unempathic zombies hate this movie,9,31 December 2008,"There are cries of ""Narcissism!"" from the assembled delineators of taste, simply because the writer cast himself in a positive role of great import. Who Cares? I couldn't care less who the actors are as long as the story presented conveys feelings and ideas of great worth.This film does.This film shows human alchemy. Each average person is, under normal conditions, really of no actual worth to humanity. Most people just go through life without really DOING anything of value for the world at large.But within the same exact people there exists the potential to do great things, and to be singularly important.The way that we can turn these base humans into beings of lustrous gold is for them to be given a cause to strive for TOGETHER. When this happens, each average individual finds their unique voice and special role that benefits the entire group.This is exactly what this film shows. And by people filling their roles and working symbiotically together for a Great Cause, we see how everyone (except the critic - just like many of you out there) is empowered and feels a greater joy and purpose in their lives.This film INTENTIONALLY set out to irritate you sniping, anal, critics. M. Night cast himself in this role specifically to irritate you, and by doing so, to make you all examples of how humanity has lost its focus. YOU people are the ones filled with pretension and arrogance, for you have utterly failed to see past the irrelevancy of CASTING and focus instead on the MEANING of the film.It is you people who cause mankind to no longer listen. And this is precisely why we inhabit a world so cold, lonely, and futile.This film presents a plan for the way forward, just as The Cookbook is said to do. And in this way, M. Night is completely justified in casting himself as he has done. This film, itself, IS THE COOKBOOK.

I am enlightened, or I think I am, relatively as everything is, and the movie ever so lightly brushes up against those avenues that lead one to enlightenment. From the exact way M. Night goes about subversively illuminating the horrific truths that exist in life, real life, I can see that he isn't fully aware of the problem's immensity, but something sparked him nonetheless and he was inspired to show the layer of it that he is currently aware of. That aside, the themes and messages of the movie are the best of the year/years. Telling people to follow feelings because that is the only indicator of truth. Saying everybody has a purpose... you know maybe M. Night does know the whole truth, maybe the bedtime story is an allegory for what is happening now in our world, but who are the monkey's in the trees protecting justice? I can understand why Disney didn't like the movie, because of its themes. And M. Night is very brave for making it.",Lady in the Water
485,theclarkone68,M. Night gets worse and worse,5,8 January 2007,"A bedtime story coming to life? That's fine, M. Night, but did you think to make the movie interesting, entertaining, compelling and such? It was that in some parts, but overall it just didn't hold up for me. Some characters were thrown in merely to throw people off, but to me those characters did nothing but drag the movie and waste time. Is that the extent of his imagination? He has to throw in characters and elements merely to waste time? That might work for a bedtime story, but movies aren't meant to put people to sleep. Shyamalan was seemingly so self conscious about the movie and criticism for it, that he threw in another unnecessary character, a movie critic by the name of Harry Farber who did nothing more than bumble through unnecessary lines, patiently stand in place waiting for something to happen (probably like a lot of the audience was doing) and to meet his demise (take that movie critics!) in a contrived way.The story is little more than a jumbled mess, but hey, it's a bedtime story so that doesn't really matter. The fantasy world doesn't really have to make sense, but it should be entertaining. You can make up the rules, but there's more to the fantasy world than just making up the rules for it, M. Night. Explore it more, flesh it out more, don't spend so much time wasting time, and possibly give it some sort of meaning. Why didn't he stop and think that his bedtime story just might not have made for a very good movie? Others do, but those tended to travel outside the confines of an apartment complex. It was almost like Shyamalan watched Melrose Place and The Neverending Story back-to-back and his story sprang to life.If this is the extent of his imagination and creativity, then Shyamalan is in trouble. Maybe he has run out of ideas, but I'm hoping that he just wanted to have some fun by trying to take a bedtime story he created and bring it to life. I hope he learned from this movie.",Lady in the Water

From the very start, this film draws you into a simple enough story. Yet, you are unable to take anything for granted and it is these nuances that keep you glued to screen. The plot twists and turns and demands attention. This is not a kids movie. It is about a group of people who have stalled in life's goal to become great in your own eyes and nobody else's. Like so many people in this world who go through bad experiences, its apparent that you can stop and let the world pass you by. Unity within a community, a family, a group of friends can push you to achieve. Push you through the darkness that may block your path and this film focuses on the thin line of coincidence, self-belief, self-worth and the ability to let go. This film will feel personal to so many people in this world that the end titles will cause many tears. Lookng around the cinema tonight, many people were visibly moved by this touching picture.

The movie is filled with outstanding characters, the sort one might expect from Ray Bradbury or Spielberg. The camera work was very clever, in my opinion. And I love how Shyamalan can come up with unique story ideas as if they were based on mythologies already in existence. I went to SUPERMAN and PIRATES with high expectations that were only met in part: SUPERMAN was only a continuation of what had been started years before, and Lex Luthor was not particularly impressive, though I love the actor; PIRATES was wonderful, but tainted in the way I felt that second movies (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK came to my mind) often are. I wondered if there would be anything else this summer--I was panicked and begging for a film that would satisfy my craving for good entertainment. I found THE LADY IN THE WATER thoroughly engrossing and entertaining. It was exactly what I needed, quite unpredictable, and fascinating throughout. I hope M. Night Shyamalan lives a long, long time.

I can't even believe how I could watch it to its end...I try to forget about this movie, so I don't really have anything else to say. But one thing is sure: this is a piece of sh*t (sorry, but I have to) that makes me wonder how people can keep letting M Night Shyamalan produce and direct movies.

Night is trying too hard, for too many movies now, to be brilliant and delivers mediocre to lousy performance as director, story teller and story author - and he cannot act, please tell him.For all M. Night fans, Sixth Sense was a remake, of at least two movies I know of, one Spanish and a french movie which portrayed the 'I-am-dead-and-I-don't-know' better than Sixth Sense, and even better story, but since such movies hardly make it to the US box office, you think Night has been writing an unique story and movie, this is NOT so.Sixth Sense was good because of the revelation at the end, but imagine the story you are interrogated in a police station, and you are accused of a homicide, and you are declining all charges, and the police office pushes you to tell your story and admit the killing, and you are refusing, you are simply not remembering, and the time goes on, and you are bullied and finally you give in, after 90 minutes you believe you watch a police interrogation thriller, then you admit of killing ... yourself ... and the officer is gets up and says, ""now you can go on, you have freed yourself from the denial"" . . .",Lady in the Water

Lady in the Water was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The story itself was jumbled, weak and uninteresting. The characters were non-existent and the dialog was an atrocity. The plot was strung along on a piece of thread, only to be knotted and discarded by the anticlimactic ending of the film. The cinematography was watchable, at best, and the music and sound were run-of-the-mill. Is this the same director that gave us the 6th Sense? M. Night is contrived in his interviews, comparing himself with Alfred Hitchcock, and in this film goes one step further by making himself a main character with a revelation so self centered it would make Mel Gibson blush. Why is this man still getting to make such predictable, stuck-up movies? I know...the money.

I would not want every movie to be a duplicate of The Sixth Sense --how boring. As for Lady, it is a charming tale that even my 15 yr old son found exciting and fun. And I was moved by Night's speech about being a writer; he put into words the heart of any creative writer's dreams regarding personal immortality.

I actually found the film to be very touching and meaningful. While perhaps not one of the director's most exciting films, it is nonetheless intriguing and entertaining. Giamatti's performance was excellent and the overall atmosphere was fitting. I think much of the film's lack of success with audiences is due to the expectations people may have had going into this movie. It is unlike any of Night's other films.

The plot isn't thick, but it is beautiful and existential yet accessible. It gives viewers hope and depth of feeling, and it leaves you wanting more. I am personally a fan of Shyamalan's work and this is up there with Signs, and the Sixth Sense. Truly a quality film",Lady in the Water
497,jumpy5,Listening with something other than our ears.,9,23 July 2006,"In the beginning of the film, there are animated figures similar to what one might find on a rock painting in the desert southwest of the U.S. As we come to the last of the series of figurines, which is a person inside a cubicle/cave working on a computer, we are told by the voice over that we have stopped listening. Perhaps one of the reasons for the confusion over this film is because we have lost our connection to mythology - we have forgotten how to listen. So the question arises, how does one speak to an audience that no longer understands the language of symbols? This is what The Lady in Water is trying to do. The language of myth tells us that everyone and everything in the story is one person. All of the different elements, from the characters, the building, the pool, the creatures, and even the sprinklers - everyone and everything - are one character. This character is stuck in a psychological attitude, and the film instructs us how the various elements of the soul struggle so that the hero can become unstuck. If you read the film this way - mythologically - then it makes sense. If, however, you concretize the symbolic elements  attempt to read them as facts rather than metaphor - then they lose their meaning and become absurd. After viewing the film, ask yourself which character really is the one who was stuck and what happened in the story so that they became unstuck? Then ask yourself what the seemingly disparate elements and characters represented in this one single character. The symbolic language of myths speaks to a place that transcends the human mind. Accordingly, if we are to hear the wisdom of their message, then we must learn to listen with something other than our ears.",Lady in the Water
498,enigmatic_evil,A enjoyable and emotional experience.,8,23 July 2006,"I have not watched too many movies made by M. Night Shyamalan. Unbreakable is one of my favorite films, where as The Village was a movie I could have gone without watching. Thankfully, Lady in The Water was a movie that did not follow the same path.The original teaser for Lady in the Water left nothing to be desired, a preview to a story I didn't want told to me. Given what i've seen of M. Night, I wasn't too sure if I was feeling motivated enough to go out and watch this or not, early signs were not optimistic.The movie is not perfect. It takes a while to get going but eventually leads you into a very imaginative and original story, a very modern fairy tale. A beautiful movie.Paul Giamatti plays a superintendent at a apartment complex. One day he saves a young woman from the pool of the apartment. He soon discovers that she is no ordinary young woman. The journey that follows is a captivating and engaging tale that you just can't help but feel curious about.This movie is too good to disappoint anyone who still has a little bit of of imagination left in them. I wasn't disappointed, and neither will you be.",Lady in the Water
499,angryman2004,One of the best films I've ever seen by a long shot!,10,16 April 2008,"I went to the cinema to see this with my family and we were expecting to see a scary movie. Instead I saw something that blew me away. A work of art that left me wanting to watch it again and again. In fact I did!I don't understand why so many people dislike this movie because, as a film in the fantasy genre, it soars above so many other films i've seen.Now as far as storyline goes I would have to say BIZARRE! But that did not worry me ... and why would it? Most of M. Night Shyamalan's films are like this. The acting (especialy from Paul Giamatti) is fantastic and unique and very appropriate for this kind of film.Overall I would have to say that this is my favourite of all Shymalan's movies! Apriciate it for what it is ... An excellent telling of an excellent fairytale!",Lady in the Water
500,FlickerDreams,A Success in Storytelling,9,21 July 2006,"Do not listen to the critics. As if they know what a good movie is. See this movie with the eyes of your inner child and you will enjoy it. I always wonder why people love to trash Shyamalan's work. Jealousy perhaps? He is one of the few people making good movies anymore. Movies built around story instead of CGI for CGI's sake. The performances were great. Giamatti was perfectly cast and carries the movie easily. The rest of the ensemble was terrific and did exactly what they should have done...support. The only problem with M. Night Shyamalan is that he keeps putting himself in his movies. He's not a great actor and his presence on screen always pulls me out of the movie. Aside from that go see this movie. But go to enjoy it, not to tear it apart.",Lady in the Water

Night did right by trying to do something different, but he failed at trying to make a good bedtime story movie. The characters, aside from Giamatti, are so unbelievable, it's uncanny. They tell them that there's a mermaid who's being chased by dogs in the grass and needs their help so an Eagle can take her home, and they just believe it and come running. This entire script felt so rushed and never once intrigued me. The point at which the guy was trying to tell the future by looking at his crossword puzzle, or when the kid was telling them how to get her home to safety by looking at a cabinet full of cereal boxes. Give me a break. So over the top, so NOT entertaining. M. Night gets an F.",Lady in the Water
502,carl_cx,Purpose,10,21 July 2006,"I have been a fan of M. Night, ever since the first film I saw of his, SIGNS. After that, I was a HUGE fan...I had to see the others. While SIGNS had always been my favorite, I love how he blended moving stories, with thriller aspects. After the critics bashed the VILLAGE (which I found to be a very well made movie) I wondered if he could recover or not. And here is is answer.This movie, much like the other ones, is a ""theme"" movie, that goes deeper than nymphs, ghosts, or creatures in the woods outside. This movie explores ""Purpose"", a theme we don't hear from much from movies. Paul Giamatti is fantastic and real in this movie, and that's why he is one of my fav actors. He could actually nab a Oscar nomination for this movie. He is INCREDIBLE.Bryce Dallas Howard is stunning...and while I think she was robbed last year at the Oscars for Village, I think this year, she will miss out on the award. She didn't stand out, because there was not as much depth to her character as their was for Paul.Shyamalan actually performed a huge part in the movie, and a very moving part. The story was well crafted...and I actually think this may have been Night's most original and daunting task of a story he has written yet. I also think this is one of his best. It's not scary. It's moving. And actually has some comedy in it, which he missed in some of his other movies. In how many thrillers do you see a guy who performs an experiment, and only works out one side of his body, so it becomes 4"" more muscular than the other. I love how he brought some many diverse people together: a critic who sees no originality in the world, a crossword puzzle genius, a stumped writer and his comedic sister, an old woman who has a thing with animals, and a man locked away in his solitude. The way they come together is incredible.One of the best parts of the movie is the music. BY FAR, the BEST music in any of Shyamalan's movies. James Newton Howard has created a masterpiece soundtrack, that's sweeping chorus of angelic voices and swelling violins and cellos will leave you awestruck. And don't believe Shyamalan's lies about there being ""no twist"". there's about 10 twists...the entire movie will keep you guessing until the very end, which is to say the least, perfect.People will tell you that the movie isn't worth 6 bucks, I'm sure, because it's not scary. They'll say that your getting gypped. I say you're not getting gypped. I'll say that Night is the one getting gypped. This movie is worth a lot more than 6 bucks.",Lady in the Water
503,melon_fire0902,Quite...enchanting.,8,25 July 2006,"Despite friends and movie reviews telling me that Lady In The Water didn't live up to M. Night Shyamalan's other works, I decided to go to the theater and find out for myself. I was shocked to find that, in all, there was only 4 people in the theater waiting to see the movie. To those who don't want to go see this movie simply because they would rather rely on reviews than decided themselves, you don't know what you're missing.From the very beginning I found the movie quite...enchanting. Maybe I'm just a sucker for a good Korean fairytale, but I really did enjoy how the story unfolded. The characters were interesting and unique, though a bit more could have gone into the development of them.Bryce Dallas Howard was wonderful in this movie. Her portrayal of the character Story was just what I would expect from a person from a fairytale-come-true. Paul Giamatti was great with providing the stutter essential to Cleveland Heep, his character.I laughed, wanted to cry, and jumped during this film. All in all, I would say that this movie is definitely worth going to the theaters, or at least renting when it's available on DVD.",Lady in the Water
504,tired_cornelious,Totally disagree,10,25 July 2006,"I saw the movie this past weekend, and for the life of me cannot figure out how anyone could not enjoy this movie. What the critics called 'farfetched"" and ""faniciful"" is exactly what made me fall in love with this film. Of course it couldn't happen (not even a little bit)... but that is what a fantasy is supposed to do! M. Night ditched his normal twist ending schtick and dedicated his imagination to straight story telling. Each character lends to the story's dynamic, creating a world of dream like wonder that I could only wish to visit. If M. Night created a fairy tale, than Paul Giammati brilliantly succeeded in turning its pages. Far-fetched?... thankfully. Fanciful?... wonderfully. If you grew up wishing you were one of Peter Pan's lost boys, or imagined yourself following Hansel's trail of crumbs than this film is for you.",Lady in the Water
505,IrishLassie1982,We all have a purpose...,10,21 July 2006,"As a child, we are apt to believe in fairy tales. Coincedentally, Shyalaman wrote this as a bedtime story for his kids. The feel from this movie is that of a fairy tale. An interesting, and unexpected direction from Shyalaman.Cleveland Heep, played with such poignancy and feeling by Paul Giamatti, is a superintendent at an apartment complex, The Cove. Personal tragedy has led him to this position, in the form of his wife and children being murdered. He is here to lock away his pain, and to forget.While going about his daily job duties, he notices someone swimming in the pool after hours. He goes to investigate, and falls in. The next thing he knows, he wakes up in his apartment, rescued by the narf (water nymph), named Story (played wonderfully by Bryce Dallas Howard). Cleveland is very confused about why she is here, and asks her who she is and how old she is...she says ""narf"", which leads him to ask an elderly Korean woman what it could possibly mean. She tells him of the story of underwater creatures from the Blue World, who sometimes emerge to give guidance and encouragement to humans.Once done, she needs help in returning to her home world. That is where Cleveland, and certain ones he knows in the apartment complex, come in...to help her return.I saw it just this evening, and was enthralled, absolutely enthralled with the story. Some teenagers in the theater got up and left in disgust, disappointed that this movie was not ""suspenseful"" or scary enough. This is not meant to be a gore/blood fest movie. Like The Village, this movie has a message...everyone has a purpose in life, and it is up to you to find your purpose.",Lady in the Water
506,Tornado363,A great movie,8,29 July 2006,Lady in the Water is about a building superintendent who finds a woman in the pool and is fight to send her home. I found myself happy with the movie. The acting was well done as well as the script.I went to this movie mainly because I knew of the cinematographer Christopher Doyl and knew that the movie would at least look wonderful. Christopher Doyl is king of cinematographers whether the movies itself is great or not.Lady in the Water is not just about a woman trying to go home. There is much more to the story. There are many deeper themes. The most obvious one is that sometimes we feel like we have no purpose in life. Also dealt with is sometimes we loose our childlike qualities and how sometimes they can be important.Maybe there are too many characters. Maybe there are too many plot points. Maybe it is too simple. The point I'm trying to make is that there is more to the movie than all that. M. Night knew what he was doing. Watch for the small things. M. Night is trying to get points across like he always is.,Lady in the Water
507,jim-1348,Dumb as a mud fence,3,24 July 2006,"Unlike a lot of people, I didn't care for ""Sixth Sense,"" mainly because it was like a drawn-out one-liner--once you knew the punchline, the rest of the show was just an overlong setup. I went to see this one on the strength of ""Signs"" and ""Unbreakable"" but that's a mistake I'll never make again. As far as ""Lady"" goes, the only thing that outstrips this movie's inanity is Shyamalan's ego. Casting himself as a writer who will ""one-day change the world"" is the ultimate in chutzpah. Shyamalan's films have always trod the edge between clever and weird, but this one tumbles from the edge into the deep chasm of stupidity. I don't know how Paul Giamatti kept a straight face through the filming. The beginning ""explanation"" of the movie's premise, with its silly stick figures, should have been the tip-off; I should have walked out then and gone to see ""Clerks II.""",Lady in the Water

509,LeoSaysGrr06,A movie that almost had potential...,5,23 July 2006,"lady in the water mixes fantasy with modern day reality so deeply, that i found this movie sometimes hard to tell whether it was being serious or not. the times i didn't feel the movie was serious when it was trying to be, made me feel very awkward. like the part where the little boy who reads cereal boxes to find answers acts so depressed and serious and says, ""oh no, i read it wrong. it said HE would be the healer not SHE."" that left me thinking, ""are you serious? how is someone in the audience supposed to take it seriously that a 7 year old boy, who found ALL that information on kids' cereal boxes, got the phrase 'she' wrong instead of 'he?'"" and which fool in the film thought the idea to give the kid all those cereal boxes (which happened to be put together in the exact right order to read all that info) and find a big clue? i made that out to be humor rather than something serious.secondly, how did Paul giamatti (Cleveland) convince all those people to get involved? wouldn't someone have thought it was crazy or needed some convincing? i think the smartest one was the guy who said ""she needs a hospital, not us all sitting around here!"" and thirdly, i feel the ending was incredibly abrupt. i mean, OK, when story goes home with the eagle everything's OK. i realized that, but i didn't know that he was going to end the film exactly that quickly, with no follow-up to whether Cleveland changes his life now (by going out to find the murderer of his wife and kids) or if he just stays the superintendent for the rest of his life.oh, and one more thing, i felt it was hard to grasp the humor sometimes. it did have some humor thrown in, but some of the things about this film (even if it is fantasy mixed with reality) were very hard for me to grasp as possible. for instance, when the film critic is about to be eaten by the ""scrunt"" he gives the audience a very long speech about why he feels he isn't going to be eaten and he'll get away...who would say that? honestly, who talks for a good long minute to themselves like that, standing in possible face of death, about how it relates to a movie? he'd be running as soon as he saw it. maybe that's just M. night shyamalan's way of expressing his view of film critics, but in the real world, i highly doubt this has ever happened to ebert & roeper, or any others for that matter.when it comes down to it, i'd have to say this movie ""had"" potential, and could've been much better than it was. but it was just put together too poorly in a sense that, ""if you don't have the exact same mind as m. night shyamalan, you will be left after the movie wondering what was half of the stuff going on in the movie."" i feel the movie could've done better with a twist at the end, some major twist explaining everything and showing that they were all nuts to believe they were the ""guild"" or ""guardians"" or ""scrunts"" and what not. but this movie was not the case. Mr. shyamalan attempted (key word, attempted) to make a film with no surprising twist at the end, just a very straight-forward flick, and i think he rushed it too much. it just didn't come out as great as most people think it could've been.",Lady in the Water
510,eddie_fast_fingers,"a beautiful movie, not a very good one...",7,18 November 2006,"I awaited it with great anticipation- for its Shyamalan's labor of love. All his previous movies had lived up to insane expectations and more: one would watch it for the impossible premise; the whispered dialogues, obtuse and profound; the sparse and understated performances and the TWIST- that would make it unnervingly real, would make your head buzz and would make you watch it again and again so that you appreciate the aforesaid unto crazy worship.And hence, the obvious disappointment when you watch 'Lady in the Water'-it leaves you hungry and unsatisfied for it does not stay with you, not even as you walk out of the theatre. But I am biased and I am a believer. And so I would give you 5 reasons to go watch this movie-1. It is a Shyamalan movie- it has atmosphere, its ridiculous, childish yet childlike, it insults your intelligence, it challenges the same.2.Because Paul Giamatti is great, as usual; and Bryce Dallas Howard is soinnocent that you'd wish to be her guardian-angel...3. Because in parts its extremely funny, something rare in Night's movies, with an incredible ensemble that only His imagination could conjure up- sample the idea of a guy who works out on only one side of the body to demonstrate the difference.4. Because this is a fairy tale- and it tests your belief. The question is can you possible suspend your 'sense'- would you ever even recognize a fairy tale coming true around you.5. Because the TWIST is that there's no twist...To conclude, watch this movie with an open mind- you will make some sense out of it, though you'll have to work hard at it.",Lady in the Water

This story is not for you. Granted, certain elements of the movie require a certain amount of naiveté'. The aforementioned is what the director was seeking to bring out in his audience. Night does a masterful job of involving the audience in the microcosm of an apartment complex. The ordinarily mundane becomes involved and detailed, as the story develops. This film could be an excellent study in story development technique. Giamatti and Howard gave magnetic performances and were expertly cast. The critics killed it at the wide screen distribution level, but it is still a good view on a home entertainment system.",Lady in the Water

But other than that there are no redeeming qualities to this movie. Coming from a director of Sixth Sense, there was not a single twist or a change in a plot that was surprising. In fact only one of them made any sense at all, the rest just appeared to be filling in so that the protagonist has something to discover. Nothing in the story/background has made his discoveries any more likely or believable than his original beliefs. Seriously. I am pretty sure he could just as well go from his end-of-the-movie discoveries and learn that the truth was actually his original misconception. And everything would make just as much sense if not more!In general, I am willing to accept at least ONE of the two: Either a great engrossing story or great special effects that mask the lack of a story. This movie had neither. The story was absolutely ridiculous and X-Men has managed to do 100x as much in terms of effects with same budget (75M).Oh, and did I mention that Mr. Shyamalan managed to cast himself as a rather significant character in the movie?

They tend to critique a movie based on how closely it resembles modern art. I personally couldn't care less. I don't go to the movies to see the latest piece of art by the newest avant-garde director. I go because I want to be ENTERTAINED (what a shocker). I don't want to be reminded of the troubles of my own life (thus, my avoidance of movies with sad endings)--I want to be entertained with a good story.""Lady in the Water"" IS a good story, and it's well done. It isn't going to bring about the change it talks about in the movie, it won't radically alter people's lives, it won't wake you up in the middle of the night to question your whole existence. If you want that kind of experience then go see... well... some other movie. ""Lady in the Water"" is just a good ride--interesting and imaginative story, engaging characters, some really funny moments, some ""boo"" jump-at-you moments, and good performances by all involved.It is NOT for everybody. Yes, the teenagers in the audience seemed bored and could not stop talking and running in and out, but I don't know that that's so much a sign of a bad movie as a sign of how stupid and inconsiderate our teenagers are. I'm sure they would have had no problem staying glued to their seats if we were viewing ""Scream 14"" instead.This movie is also NOT ""The Sixth Sense"". Yes, I loved the ""turn your whole world upside down in two seconds"" moment at the end of ""Sixth Sense"", but it is unfair to expect that from Shyamalan every time and not judge him on his own merits as a director. (And I'm not just a Shyamalan ""yes man""... I hated ""Unbreakable"").My only major dislike was the music for the end credits.

It seemed like you had to know a little bit about the story before hand to truly understand what was going on. Secondly, M. Night could have gotten some better acting for this movie, as both Giamatti and Howard where big let downs. Third, you would have thought that he could have put a little bit more ""horror"" into the film, as he did with movies such as ""The Village"" and ""The Sixth Sense"". Honestly, the only true parts that made me jump where when the theater was dead quiet, and the sprinklers turned on. Overall this was the worst M.

And truthfully, don't bother reviewing the film even if it's your job because all it does is show your lack of versatility as a film reviewer.Lady in the Water is a fascinating film. It's a fantasy, a mystery, a drama, a comedy, it's a lot thrown at you. But don't let that fool you. Shyamalan uses strange creatures because he's creative but remember, not everything is as it seems. The characters in The Cove are much like all of us.

I really enjoyed ""Lady in the Water"", but it certainly has its serious flaws.The acting is superb. Paul Giamatti is certainly one of the finest actors working today. He brought heart and soul into the part. Bryce Dallas Howard could not have been more perfect for the role. She is incredibly beautiful, but in such an ethereal way that it seems she does indeed come from another world. And I think Night himself did a fine job. And as an aside, I really never realized how attractive he is. And Bob Balaban was dead-pan funny.The cinematography and score are up to Night's usual high standards. The script is beautifully written, and it is indeed original.But let's get back to that storyline. You know, it really is pretty silly. Narfs, grass creatures, monkey-looking things, a long involved myth, eagles (LOTR, anyone?), healers, interpreters, etc, a kid who can read the myth from cereal boxes? Uh yeah, it is kind of silly.

Picture a fairy tale within a fantasy within too much of the ""Signs"" story (and music?), and you have a ""Lady in the Water"". As a big fan of Night, I've been enthralled by his tales of space creatures, comic book heroes and...yes...dead people. This movie is being critically panned, and, unfortunately, for good reason.

It is visually stunning, and the acting is great, but the plot is just bad, but whats good acting and great Cinematographery without a good plot!This would have to be Shyamalan's funniest movie yet but there is not enough funnies in it to be considered a comedy. Although there are a few intense sequences there intense enough (or there are not enough of them) to be a thriller. There is also not enough scary sequences in the film to be a horror movie! So basically I would have to call it a film that fits only one genre, the Dumb Plot genre.OK, you still might be saying that does not matter there is always a plot twist! WRONG!!! Not this film! It is left with a long drawn out ending that could have been cut in half. So now the question is not if you will see it, but the question is will M.Night. Shyamalan get another chance? As we know he walked out on Disney (but you can say Disney just said ""Your losing your touch, so we are done"") but Warner was there to lend a helping handing which now I am sure they did not.Well Disney was right M.Night IS losing his touch which is a shame, because he was such a good director and writer.

Night scraping the bottom of the barrel!",1,14 August 2006,"I would like to start off saying I like the other M.Night films, including the village which I think is much better than it is given credit for. Therefore, when I heard that Lady in the water had been given a right royal roasting by the critics I basically ignored them and went in looking to enjoy it. Boy were they right. Lets start off with the good points, Paul Giamatti. He has been brilliant in everything for the last couple of years and this is no exception. He holds your sympathy throughout, with a wonderful piece of melancholic comedic acting. But even he struggles with the utterly diabolical script. Oh sweet God above why didn't anyone stop the man. It is awful. The Narf, the Scrunt, the eagle of doom, the Ooglies Booglies, shut up. Stopping spouting this MINCE. You can type this sh*t but you sure as hell cant say it (to paraphrase). I could moan all day about the inadequacy of the plotting and the terrible dialogue, but am sure you will be glad to know I wont, I'll move on. The other negatives: if this film was meant to be a bedtime story (sweet Jesus calling your main characters Cleveland and story isn't cool it fr*cking annoying, whats happen to great, y'know proper names like Dave and Molly, anyway....) why shoot it like a brooding horror film. It shouldve had a light feel to it, which may have made me relax a bit and roll with the childish devices of the narrative including the character names. Furthermore, if you are writing a film about a writer who work in the future will save mankind then by all that is good in the world do not cast yourself as the saviour of the world you egotistical divvy. If you thought his cameo acting in his other films were bad, and everyone I know did, then even you are not prepared for how just downright bad he is in this film. I mean he is woeful. The film as a whole just does not work, with Bryce Dallas Howard as captain plot exposition (yeah her name is story I got it, its not big nor clever) Paul Giamatti hung out to dry by the script, Jeffrey Wright given nothing but the crossword to do. Good actors cant save this mess. Just one final point - if you are making a film with a character which is a film critic then don't be petty git and make him an d*ck and kill him brutally in sub scream style. That just smacks of cheap meanness. ""You don't like my films, eh? How'd you like that horrible death""......Anyway to sum this vaguely literate rant up, this film is so bad that at least four people died during the film and I only managed to survive the screening by chewing my own leg off.",Lady in the Water
522,tantrik,It is the story of a narf princess who comes into the real world to influence the thoughts of a writer and to help him write a book.,5,22 July 2006,"I have always liked and appreciated movie directors who like to experiment, especially the ones who try new ways of storytelling, an essential ingredient that seems to be missing from most movies now a days. M. Night Shyamalan is once such director who can create so much interest in a movie purely by his narrative. I liked sixth sense and the subtle horror in his movies that he achieves mostly from playing on the viewers emotions. He does not seem to care much for too much special effects in trying to scare people, as evident from his four previous ventures. The thing that I liked about signs, again, is his vision of what it would be like if an alien invasion really happened! No gigantic sets or Computer graphics, but seeing the horror and the shock of unnatural things happening to regular people seems to be his way of film making. Although, in the village, the end was disappointing, it arose more from the fact that there was nothing spectacular beyond the woods. Unbreakable, once again was a different story that manoj tried to bring to us in his own way. In all his previous movies it seemed more like he was making the movie for the audience but this aspect seems to be missing from his latest offering, lady in the water. Firstly, the movie was about a bed time story that he used to tell his kids. If the story was something that everyone knew then they would identify the characters and accept them all the more. Secondly, the script does not seem to be as tightly woven as it was in the case of the sixth sense. He reveals only a part of the bed time story to us, from time to time, just as much needed for the next few scenes. I still have some questions that are unanswered, maybe because I just couldn't watch the movie with the usual attentiveness that I watch his movies with. How did the narf get into the swimming pool and what about the undiscovered tunnel inside a swimming pool? and why cant the narf go back to the blue world from the pool? But maybe these questions are just as stupid as the story itself and one cannot expect to see any reasoning in a bed time story (is it really something that kids wanna listen to before they go to sleep?)! It seems like it was a good decision for Disney to have backed out of this project, although they have been quite supportive in the past. M Night seems to have made a movie for himself and not for the audience. It is still a daring move and I will certainly give him credit for trying out something different. I have been an ardent fan of his movies and I will continue to watch his movies with the same excitement. One should not be too hard on him for LITW. He is still a good writer and a director and we can still expect some very interesting stories and storytelling from him.",Lady in the Water

But there are rules, rewards and punishments in Fairyland.The movie has touching moments, a bit of humour in places, and the odd ""jump in your seat"" moment.

524,evilnutta,A classic in waiting,9,9 February 2007,"It's a shame that critics (both professional and casual alike) cannot get past three main issues when watching this film.1/ The ego of M Night Shyamalan. Yep, he knows he's good. Because he is. Get over it.2/ The postmodern, self referencing nature of the film. Its a story about storytelling. Many find this clumsy and distracting..which may be true to some. However, it'a ashame when more and more dross is being produced, especially by Hollywood, that an intelligent, contemporary art movie, dressed in blockbuster clothing, is dismissed because it's themes are too distracting from the entertainment aspect. Where does it say a film has to hide its themes under a veil of popcorn fun-stuff?3/ Illogical events happen in the story (a giant eagle appears!!!) and characters do Illogical things (they accept the fantasy elements without question). But this is about faith, storytellers and fairy tales. In such tales, the story is made up as it progresses and faith is placed in the characters and storyteller to ensnare us in the narrative. Alas, many critics lack the innocence of childhood to accept this fairytale, just as Shyamalan predicts.Without these concerns an audience is able to experience a profoundly moving movie with layers of thematic content which are fascinating to unravel. Those who don't get it lose out on the story thanks to their own preconceptions and limitations. Their loss. As the movie states, ""Man has forgotten how to listen"". Unfortunately and predictably, so have critics.",Lady in the Water

527,LunarArcane,Extremely Far-fetched Art,4,16 December 2006,"Sitting through this movie was different. Throughout the entire length of this movie I was flip flopping through what I was going to give this movie (1/5? 2/5? 3/5?). I was loving the characters; Giamani shows a great performance in this movie, and Shamalyn himself has one of the best and heartfelt moments when Story tells him that he is going to die because people don't agree with his words. But overall the entire concept of this movie just isn't believable. This would be different if it takes everyone a long period of time to believe the story, but as soon as Clevland (Giamanti) tells the story, they all seem to believe him instantly. This is why throughout this entire movie back and forth I could not decide on what to give this movie for a rating. This movie is original in many ways, the way the plot is developed is done in a way I haven't seen before in many aspects. But it is in the end missing something, maybe its the random ways things develop and how all these people that are needed are magically in the same apartment complex. I think that in the end I would give this movie a 2/5. But then again a 3/5.

I agree that Mr. Shyamalan has really tried to make something out of nothing but I'm sorry to say that in my point of view he wasn't quite successful this time. OK. I had high hopes after I saw the first few minutes, so I kept watching, but after a short while I got the feeling that this story wasn't going anywhere.

If you liked Signs and The Sixth Sense and The Village you will love this well put together film. I would give this film 8 out of ten. but also this film was rated PG i would have thought a more correct rating would be M. This film would not be a film to take small children to this is more Teenagers up to adults movie. NOT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN! The reason this movie would not be suitable would be because not many children would understand the concepts of this movie. However if you have a very bright child that understands adult concepts please take your child along because this movie is a must see.,Lady in the Water

It was original, tasteful (which a lot of ""indy"" developments are not today), and flows nicely. If you enjoy M. Night Shyamalan, you will not be disappointed with this film. Even my child liked the fantasy story to it. Had a few nice little ""jump"" scenes, and the characters are all very interesting. It all seemed very original, well developed, and very imaginative, creating a world of characters, that were entertaining and likable. Its very nice to have an original story thrown out finally in a time of movies that character development is based on how many guns they can shoot at once.",Lady in the Water
531,jilliant-1,Great Movie,8,28 December 2006,I just finished watching this movie and feel compelled to add a comment. I was a little leery to watch Lady in the Water because I am a person who tends to like either action or drama and this movie is not classified as either. The movie was much better than I expected and it kept me guessing from the very beginning. I felt myself being drawn into the plot and wondering if I would believe any of this if it were to happen. I was surprised to see the larger than usual role played by M.Night and really enjoyed seeing him act in his own movie. I have a great deal of respect for his writing and acting. I would and will recommend this movie to people of various ages and interests. The lead characters did such a good job in their roles and have kept my interest even though the movie is over. Great Movie..,Lady in the Water

535,zoemorn,Lady swims but may be too slow for some,7,16 January 2007,"Without giving anything away, I felt that Lady in the Water was fine. This statement sounds, as it should, like a response to many around me who felt it was not fine, many stated it was the worst that Shyamalan has done. I am a fan of his films thus far and was excited when hearing about this one. Perhaps his earlier successes lead up to some feeling like Lady didn't cause them to react as much. Shyamalan is well know for his style of movie-story telling using twists, turns and subtleties to detail his suspenseful work. Really, I found that he basically adhered to his normal style but it didn't seem to hold the impact its predecessors. The speed of the movie felt slow, similar to ""Unbreakable."" The storyline is based on a bedtime story that Shyamalan would tell his kids, which you'll find out in the DVD Extra's but I almost enjoyed the setting of the storyline better than how it was setup in the movie.Overall, a decent movie at least worth a movie rental. Perhaps some felt like the movie didn't contain twists that were as potent as previous movies, seemingly substandard to Shyamalan's previous attempts at fooling the audience.Also, many I've talked with didn't appreciate the nature and level of role that he wrote himself into. In past films, it seemed novel like an easter egg for there to be Shyamalan having a cameo somewhere in the film- people enjoyed noticing or hunting for him. In Lady, he has a major role (as a great writer no less)- and this seemed a little haughty whether intentional or not. But still, an interesting fantasy with humble characters- at least worth a look.",Lady in the Water
536,groove75,Pretentious and unremarkable... True disappointment from a fan.,5,24 July 2006,"I honestly have no idea where to begin with this film. I found almost every aspect of the movie to be intrinsically flawed in some way. Let's start with the story: Problem number 1: There is nothing remarkable or inherently believable about MNS's ""bedtime fable"". It's a pretentious attempt to enchant the watcher with a compelling and intriguing fantasy story that fails in every attempt. The story itself is replete with incongruities and ambiguity. (Not a spoiler since it is explained at the beginning of the film..) Sea nymphs estranged from Man since the beginning of time with the ability to empower mankind with probity and moral integrity? Mankind has become depraved and subverted and awaits ""enlightenment"" that only the sea nymphs can bring? I'll certainly give it merits for originality, but the story fails to compel and is lost throughout the course of the movie in ponderous and delphic details of the sea nymph legend. This was one of the primary mistakes from MNS in my opinion. It was arrogant presumption on his part that the masses would find his bedtime story as enchanting vis-a-vis the classics of literature. If you're going to pick a fable, pick something that rivals the greats, not a confusing, unbelievable, sophomoric and decidedly unintelligent story that fails to make the audience care what happens.Problem number 2: This film is 110 minutes. That's one hour and 40 minutes of screen time. I can think of almost 15-18 quasi-important characters that we are introduced to in this short amount of time. There is absolutely no time for any character development whatsoever. Yet, MNS uses dramatic scenes (Giamatti's tearful scene with Howard 2/3rds of the way through the film..) that are designed to stir emotions within the audience through an empathetic connection that ultimately fails due to the poor development. At the end of the film, I hardly knew any more about Giamatti's character than I did 15 minutes into the film. Every one of the characters is one or two dimensional, and is not properly developed to provide any sort of connection with the audience. I found myself not really caring about any of the characters even though I knew that I was expected to. The irony is that a couple of characters that are given the most screen time and ""development"" are mysteriously lacking from the end of the movie or given extremely minor roles.Problem number 3: There's an almost intangible element of dichotomous incongruity between some very fundamental aspects of this film. I had a difficult time putting my finger on it, but I'll try to articulate as best I can. MNS provides us with a poorly sketched fantasy fable where we are expected to suspend belief in reality and extend belief in the supernatural. The problem is that this fantasy is too firmly grounded in a logical framework of realism. It's set in an apartment complex with modern day people carrying on their modern day lives in a world that could readily substitute for the one we live in today. It's not enough to ask the audience to suspend all belief for the mere sake of a facile fantasy story if you are going to so firmly entrench it in the trappings of modern convention. The audience expects a quasi logical framework to the fantasy that makes it more believable in such a realistic environment. The film fails in this regard. The characters' actions are laughably unbelievable compounded with a fantasy fable that makes no sense whatsoever when held to scrutiny. Moreover, the ""twist"" is no twist at all I'm afraid.Positives: Giamatti gives an impressive performance and I thought the cgi effects of the malevolent creatures was done very well.Final comments: All in all this is a pretentious film that aims to enchant, but ultimately fails due to poor character development, short runtime, and a lackluster fantasy story.My vote: 5/10",Lady in the Water
537,Talamascaa,Review of the movie,8,21 July 2006,"I saw Lady in the Water tonight and I quite enjoyed it. M. Night Shyamalan's movies are pretty much hit or miss with me, so I was glad this one touched me the way it has. It was nice to be able to see a movie in modern times that was not a constant, in your face every second type thriller. Instead, the story unfolds in layers, forcing you to think instead of having everything handed to you like most films these days. The film was more of a journey of a lost soul trying to find himself rather than just another horror film. Sure, there were some moments that the entire audience jumped, but as I said before, this movie has many layers. It was also nice to see a film with regular looking people and not Hollywood glam. Bryce Dallas Howard is an attractive woman in real life, but in this movie she looked more plain than I have ever seen her. Paul Giamatti was slouchy looking and had a bad stutter. All the neighbors in this film were just regular looking people making the movie easier to relate to. I give this film an 8 out of 10, which is very fair I think. This is a movie that I would see again, but not so great that I'd call it one of my favorite movies. It's definitely worth the money. Especially if you typically like M.

This is his 7th movie that I watched and I had low expectations considering the bad rating.After watching the movie my love for Shyamalan's magic has only increased. I still don't understand why this movie has poor rating. This was released in 2006 and maybe the audience at the time had a different kind of expectation or maybe as in the case of the movie The Village, even this movie was marketed wrongly.I read some extremely critical reviews and they seemed more like a personal attack than an well thought out critic.

But I keep watching his films with great anticipation only to leave the theater disappointed. ""Lady in the Water"" has some good moments, but ultimately falls short. Without writing spoilers, I can say the biggest flaws are the lack of suspense and the lack of character development of the ""Lady."" (Hey, even fairy tale characters have endearing quirks or charming qualities.) As to the first point, we know from the beginning the Lady will return to her world without much ado. The only surprises are the parts the other characters play in helping her do so. And while the supporting characters are amusingly eccentric, the Lady's character is so flat, I found I didn't really care if she got back to her world or not. Obviously the fairy tale is a backdrop for larger themes of healing and redemption but with little substance to the fairy tale, it simply comes off as a flimsy structure on which to hang ""Author's Message."" Shyamalan obviously loves Bryce Dallas Howard's face, as her endless close-ups reveal. Yet the actress isn't given much to work with here. At the same time, the director gives himself a larger role than usual, which I found distracting--he's not much of an actor, and I don't think we needed him in the film. Paul Giamatti shines in the leading role, and his performance brought tears to my eyes. True, there are poignant moments as well as a lot of humor in this film, but I left the theater feeling as though I'd eaten cotton candy--it was sweet, but not filling at all.7/28/06--Forgot to mention ""Signs"" as one of his best movies!",Lady in the Water
542,shambam1987,Lady in the Water,7,31 March 2007,"I apologise if I seem bias in any way, I am a big fan of M Night Shyamalan's work. I do think his movies are visually beautiful, his characters quirky, his art of telling a story is impeccable, and the story itself is, funny, strange while remaining moving and emotional with some sense of importance and meaning. His characters are interesting each with their own story. His protagonist's usually have both the A and B story lines which run alongside each other, and the B storyline usually orbits the protagonist's past life, revolving around his family, which works to amplify the meaning and quality of the A story. The cast for his movies are very strong, each lead actor keeps me entranced, especially their relationship with the supporting cast. Also enticing is his movies' visual merit, and strange, twisting story tying to the paranormal and fantastical.To the reader of this review I really only have to say one thing, Lady in the Water is no exception to all of the above.",Lady in the Water

Night Shyamalan (The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village) Synopsis: The film centers on ""The Cove""; an apartment complex maintained by superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Night after night, he hears the crashing of water from the complex's pool, and believes the pool is being used after hours.But on the night that changes his life, he meets a girl named Story (Bryce Dallas Howard). Cleveland realizes that she is called a ""narf""; a rare type of sea nymph from a bedtime story, who is trying to make the journey back to her home in ""The Blue World"".But the creatures that lie in the grass are bent on preventing her from going back to her home, and Cleveland and the fellow tenants start to realize that they are part of a bedtime story that is becoming real, and start to help her get home.Any big movie buff will have heard the negative reviews and the fact that the film currently only made 45 million dollars in North America since its release on July 21st. But I can say that this was one of the best films I have ever seen. Everything about this film, the acting, direction, cinematography, writing, is superb and perfect!The film is about having faith in yourself, and of something bigger than yourself. Some people will respond to this film with negativity and will have a different opinion, because they will have different ideas about this film, and the important message in it. For writer/director Shyamalan to make a story so personal is what I think is the mark of a great filmmaker. Ever since the mega-hit ""The Sixth Sense"" opened, his films have had a major impact in North America, and the world. This film is no exception. Even though it is a box office flop, the film still got attention, good or bad.Now you might think of the plot and laugh, and go about your ways. But consider this: I've seen my fair share of bad reviews for a film. It is one thing to express your opinion of a film or a book. But I've seen people on site reviews and message boards try to ruin Shyamalan's reputation and career, and I don't think that is right.So if you want to see this film, by all means go and see it by any means. I hope you'll like it. If you don't, that's fine too. It's a matter of opinion. But I am writing this review, hoping that the film will get somebody's attention.In Conclusion, this film is a work of art, and by far in my head the best film of 2006, and the best film I've seen in a long time.",Lady in the Water
544,dred110,Microphones!,6,27 July 2006,"Not a bad movie, but Shyamalan should have spent more time with the character that he, himself, portrayed. This character had a very interesting predicament that wasn't fully developed. I think the reason the character was somewhat shallow was because Shyamalan didn't want to seem anymore self-indulgent than people are already accusing him of being, but he should have cast someone else in the role and wrote the character stronger. Paul Giamatti knocked out his role, excellent job. But let's get to the microphones... what the hell? Boom mics in something like thirty shots! No kidding! Once or even twice is forgivable, but this was unreal. It completely removes you from the story because you've got boom mics following the characters around, bobbing up and down above their heads. That's just ridiculous. I mean, isn't that the first rule on how to be a director? Don't get your friggin boom mics in the shot! Was Gary Coleman holding the mics? With CGI and all they can do today, it's totally unforgivable. Lazy. Oh, and I'm sorry, but the monkey-people gotta go.

545,tudor-baltoiu,"Interesting story, but boring",4,1 March 2015,"Since Signs, I've always approached an M. Night Shyamalan film with some sort of fear because he went downhill from there. When I got to see Lady in the Water, I gave him a chance and I said to myself: ""How bad can it be?""The story, based on a bedtime story written by Shyamalan, was quite interesting, but kind of short for a two hour film. Because of this, it drags on, giving the film a very slow pace. It also features Shyamalan's trademark plot twist, but this one seems forced and somewhat predictable (at least it was for me).I think the greatest fault I find with this film is Shyamalan casting himself in an important role. He made cameo appearances before this one, but here he has quite a lot of screen time, even though he's an awful actor. Bryce Dallas Howard (Story) didn't give a good performance either. Her acting is dull, uninteresting and over-dramatic.When I looked at the film's budget and saw $75 million, I couldn't help but think where did so much money went? The whole movie takes place in an apartment complex so there aren't many sets, the visual effects are very few and look kind of cheap and the film doesn't have any stars to say that they asked for a big salary. The cinematography isn't that great either. Actually, this almost looks like a low budget film.In my mind, this film has two redeeming qualities: Paul Giamatti's performance and James Newton Howard's masterful music score. He's a standard collaborator of Shyamalan and I think that this is his best work.Overall, this is a boring and uninteresting film, but still decent and watchable. It is certainly not Shyamalan's worst film, but still miles away from The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. However, it is quite solid compared to The Happening and The Last Airbender, so I consider it to be somewhere in the middle in Shyamalan's canon. Not awful, but could have been better. 4 out of 10.",Lady in the Water

One night, he sees a woman swimming in the lake who reveals to him that she is a narf, a creature from The Blue World, who is trying to get home. Unfortunately, there are other creatures from The Blue World who are trying to prevent her from doing so.The first scene of the movie involves Cleveland trying to kill a bug successfully. After that's finished, he goes outside and talks to the most stereotypical Vietnamese character I've ever seen, who I thought was a prostitute at first. At this point, I had no idea whether I was witnessing character development or comic relief.Not far away, Cleveland meets up with the title character, named Story to be specific, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. Although she is supposed to be a mysterious, elegant character, her words lack any emotion. Although her name is Story, the one she tells is not very interesting and most of the movie, she is spent staring off into the distance or snooping through Cleveland's personal belongings.Cleveland is desperately trying to help Story, and for some reason, everyone in his apartment building believes what she's saying. The other tenants are ridiculous characters, all of whom make complete fools out of themselves unintentionally. It's as if M. Night Shyamalan has run out of ways to explain his muddled fairy tale and therefore, he throws in characters who are wise, or who know about this particular story, or who can offer some sort of insight on what to do.The aforementioned Vietnamese character, named Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung) has a mother who knows all about the lady in the water and the blue world, but is always reluctant to tell Cleveland more. Mr. Dury (Jeffrey Wright) loves crossword puzzles, and thinks he can learn more about what to do next by solving them. Why do they know so much and why are they all living in the same apartment building? Sheer coincidence? All these characters become jumbled together, which leads to several drawn-out, awfully written sequences that are boring, unnecessarily complicated, and lead up to zero payoff. It's as if M. Night Shyalaman does not know what he is doing. He is making the story up as it goes along with no explanations for what is happening. Trying to make the story complicated loses many viewers, but never fear. There's no real essence behind it anyways.At the very end of the movie, in order to wrap up one loose end among many, we are thrown a deus ex machina which seals up exactly how I feel. M. Night Shyamalan is not being smart, he has not written something that is too deep for us to understand, and he has not delivered a social message or lesson. He is improvising. Improvisation does not work in a movie like this.",Lady in the Water
547,Sir_oZner,"People should drop the twists and ""dead people"". Nice movie!",7,9 September 2006,"With some high expectations of his new movie, I thought it was a nice one, but not his best. He started good with the Sixth Sense and after that I already had a feeling for M Night. I didn't like Unbreakable and The Village the first time, because of the expectations I had (mostly from Sixth Sense (and for Village the trailers). But if you look beyond that, M Night is a great storyteller and he puts it on film even better.I think that everybody should drop the ""M Night things"" such as the twists in his earlier movies and the scary ""I See dead People"". The lovers learned that after the Village!LADY itself is a beautiful masterpiece, the direction, the music and the camera and the cast! The story is just a nice fairytale, nothing more. Most of the people complain about the stereotyped cast, I can agree with that, but you should not forget: most productions (and mankind) ride on stereotypes! I don't accept that reason for bashing this movie. And with this and The Village, M Night proofs that he can tell any story. And people can appreciate it when they drop the expectations... Otherwise M Night is not your storyteller! ;)",Lady in the Water
548,tarkanking,A Fresh Night Breeze,7,22 July 2006,"Night has produced another unique film, with its own unique twists (though not nearly as major as his other films) and its own unique message. It may not be the thriller that his other films have been, but it still contains its suspenseful moments. Night succeeds in creating a entertaining story with humor, drama and meaning. I recommend seeing it with an open mind, after all, Night has impressed us in the past by breaking conventions and trying new things, and if this movie followed the same formula of his other movies, it wouldn't be that original. Oh, and for all you who try to figure out movies, Night has a little ""tribute"" to you. And that's all I have to say about that.",Lady in the Water
549,jatie001,"Possibly Night's weakest, but still worth seeing...",8,22 July 2006,"...only if you like his other films. If you didn't like The Village or Unbreakable (in my opinion, his two least accessible, yet amazing films) then you're not gonna like Lady. I, however, really enjoyed all of his films ever since he released 6th Sense, and found this one to be very intriguing and very well shot. Christopher Doyle, who is Chinese director Wong Kar Wai's cinematographer, does some amazing focus tricks with the camera and M. Night knows exactly when to use hand-held and when to use static tripod shots. Also, James Newton Howard, who scored all of his films, does a great job at the score. It's not as good as score to The Village or 6th Sense, but it works.There are some moments where the story felt weak and some characters that don't seem necessary, but overall, great movie and definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of his other films.",Lady in the Water
550,CaliEmoBoy,Shyamalan will turn your expectations on its head yet again!,10,22 July 2006,"I saw this film twice today. the first time I saw it was in the morning, and there weren't that many people. I thought it was good, but not great. The second showing, however, I saw at night and the auditorium was sold out.The audience, much like the first time I saw Signs, was electric. They laughed at the right places and they screamed at the right places. I'll admit that the reviews had gotten me down, and my expectations were a bit lowered going into the movie. However, I can see this being the crowd pleaser that Signs and The Sixth Sense both were. I imagine it will have a bigger open than expected as well.To call this movie a departure for Shyamalan would be an understatement. For one, forget the advertisements -- this is by no means a horror. This movie is in the spirit of '80s fantasy movies. Watching this was like watching E.T. the Extra-terrestrial, Labyrinth, Poltergeist, The Dark Crystal, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and The Never Ending Story all for the first time. At the same time, the marketing is genius. Unlike The Village, those going into Lady in the Water will be pleasantly surprised with a clearer, more precise and poignant story about finding your purpose. If The Village was an ensemble about running from the world and sheltering innocence through fear, then this is on the opposite side of the spectrum. This is about going out into the world, even though it's a scary place sometimes, and serving your purpose.Paul Giamatti's character -- Cleveland Heep -- is easily my favorite character of all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies. He made me feel something and a lot of this should be accredited to Giamatti's incredible talent. The Summer of 2006 will go down as the Summer of mediocrity, but this movie stands out to me. It moved me. It gave me chills, and I felt like crying for Giamatti's character. I sympathize with him. I want him to find his purpose. When he does, it got to me.A theme I'm noticing in all of Shyamalan's movies is the idea that we're all connecting. This is his passion piece, and it shows. I've heard him say that the experience that got him into film-making was sitting next to strangers at a packed screening of Raiders of the Lost Ark. That the audience became intertwined with one another while watching a movie, and he no longer felt alone -- he felt connected. My prayer is that this movie can do that. The audience I was with responded well, and I hope this one finds the audience The Village lost. It certainly deserves it. In addition, I think kids will eat this up.Shyamalan is here to stay.",Lady in the Water
551,anne-198,Leave your baggage at the door,7,23 July 2006,"I honestly have sympathy for Night. Sixth Sense, in my opinion, is practically flawless. And now no one can go into his movie and just WATCH it. They are always analyzing it and looking for the clues for the twist. Just appreciate it! He isn't making Sixth Sense part 8, he is making different movies! Now I know that all of them up until this one have had twists but my point is I constantly people (and critics) compare their experience of the current movie to Sixth Sense, or how they felt about the movie up until the twist.The Village is probably the biggest example. I enjoyed it and felt it was thought-provoking. But as others have said, the marketing to make it seem horror ultimately led people to be disappointed.So now to my thoughts on the movie....it is a great fairy tale. Paul Giamatti is fantastic. Watch it and forget who directed it. I bet you a penny you will enjoy it more.",Lady in the Water
552,siwikoli2,Gotta play Shyamalan's game to like this movie,8,28 July 2006,"If you are not familiar with and like: myths, mythology, fairy tales, and ready to suspend all disbelief, you will not like this movie. Not only did Shyamalan write and direct it , he also had a supporting role. Giamatti is great as the super in a large apt. complex and someone is swimming in his pool at night ---against the rules. You absolutely must be there for the opening credits. They explain the myth/story you'll be dealing with. The most fun is deciding which of the kooky people living in the complex will fill the myth's necessary characters. About 3/4 into the movie Shyamalan almost lost me with a preposterous scene with a child and some cereal boxes - where was the editor???? But all, in all it was a lot of fun. Wouldn't you love to see Shyamalan and Deepok Chopra do a TV talk show together!!!!! Great looks and great brains!!!!",Lady in the Water
553,Mayzini,Waste of time,3,5 November 2007,"I love some M. Night Shyamalan movies, like 6th Sense and the village.But movies like unbreakable, signs and this one are in mine opinion real bad. 6th Sense was a real tense movie, with a great ending. So was the village. I was totally surprised by that 2 endings.With this movie there just isn't a surprise ending. And the movie is just childish. A wolf, monkey and eagle as the mysterious creatures. And a women who must go back to her world??? That just ain't a good story. I hoped during the movie that the ending would me somehow surprising, so you would like the see the whole movie again to relive the story with the new facts you've got from the ending. But the ending was just disappointing. Also the characters were lame and it was all to big of a coincidence. Not only is the movie bad, but it irritated me all the time. Like when the movie-criticus was attacked by the wolf, he just keeps on nagging about the resemblance with a horror movie :s. Sometimes i did laugh, but that was at the moments you weren't supposed to.To conclude, it looks like M. Night Shyamalan made a bad parody on his good movies... Hope his next one will be better then this piece of crap.",Lady in the Water

556,anadyr21,Actually not bad,8,1 February 2008,"I avoided this movie after hearing the horrible reviews and being utterly disgusted with The Village. This movie was surprisingly pretty good. I liken this movie to Signs in which I didn't really GET it until the second viewing, so I suspect not everyone GOT this movie either. While the movie is a ""bedtime story"", I also took it as a meta analysis of literary criticism as a whole, not just on M.Night's work in particular. Who is to say what a writer meant when he wrote a character or a scene? Only the writer can and one can't assume all classic conventions of storytelling always have to occur (hence the critics erroneous analysis of his possible fate).I only have 2 complaints: 1)there were so many characters in this movie, you could easily completely forget about them until they were pulled out in the end. 2)directors should only do cameos, not be a necessary character to the plot. I just didn't buy the ""actor"" or character as writing something as influential as creating a world changing movement in consciousness.M. Night's movies have been promoted as being ""scary"" and with a twist. This could potentially be his downfall as this movie has neither. It is mostly character driven and for the ADHD audiences, this movie would be too slow and boring. Too bad.",Lady in the Water
557,Tyger_Typer,"Lady is not a nightmare, but a splashing good time!!!",10,27 July 2006,"M. Night Shymalan is one of the most talented directors today, he has the ability to bring out the emotion in his movies. He can make us laugh, jump with fear, feel creeped out, feel sad, jump with joy. He can make a very serious creepy/scary situation have humor in it. His recent film that has been getting very very few good reviews from critics is one of his best i think he has made (plus there is critic in the movie and i can see why critic wouldn't like it), but this movie is more about the story than visuals, in others words more dialogue than action (but there is still some action).Lady in the Water is about ""The Cove"" apartment complex superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) who discovers a women in the ""The Cove"" pool. Her name is Story (Bryce Dallas Howard) who turns out to be a narf or sea-nymph. Cleveland tries to help her get home but there is a problem, one of Narf enemies called a Scrunt (a wolf-like creature) is roaming the hotel waiting for a chance to grab her. Can Cleveland save Story from the Scrunt and help her get home? I actually really liked this movie. It had suspense, humor, and some good story themes to it. Now most of you probably have the impression that this movie is a Horror film or a Scary movie with a huge twist like Shymalan other films. The truth is IT DOESN'T. You will absolutely be very disappointed in this film if you expect to be scared out of your mind and have huge twist in the end. There are parts that will make you jump but there a very few of those. Another thing, some people didn't enjoy this film cause they didn't think it was OK to laugh,this film has tons of humorous moments which made it more enjoyable to watch (but it is not a comedy). For being a Shymalan fan though, I probably enjoyed it more than most, so I suggest that you go in with low expectations. But if you are looking for a fun suspenseful, humorous movie, Lady in the Water is the movie that should be on top of your list!",Lady in the Water

Charming, funny, and truly one of the best fairy tale themed movies I've ever seen.It is sad to think this movie flopped due to poor marketing; A tragedy in its case.And now it's time to answer the big question: Is M. Night Shyamalan a self-absorbed narcissist? No. This may shock some people, but let me explain myself. M. Night made a movie before this entitled The Village. People didn't like it (excluding myself) because the ending and because like Lady in the Water, it's marketing portrayed it as something it wasn't. It took a lot of effort and time to make The Village, and to have people dislike it must have crushed Shyamalan. That's why in Lady in the Water, a critic dies. It's why M. Night Shyamalan cast himself as 'The Chosen One'. He was just trying to regain his ego. And when people disliked Lady in the Water, it killed Shyamalan.",Lady in the Water

The rest of this movie is so convoluted that the cast has to gather every 10 minutes to try and figure out what the hell is happening. They literally change who plays what role, right in the middle of the movie! It's like no one wrote this. Shyamalan just said ""Ok, there's a lady in the water at some point, aaannnnnnnddd ACTION!""This is a hatchet job of a film.Wow trying to find the energy to write 10 lines about this 2 hour waste of my life is really difficult!

I never ever put much faith into the general critique of a movie. If a person is not in touch with that inside themselves which the movie is trying to make them feel, their perception of it will be obviously be totally different than the writer/director intended. I have fiercely protected my inner child, and the shreds of innocence that I have left. It's a huge part of me, one of the best parts. I feel that his movie intended to give us back some of our innocence, to help us feel that even the least brave or ""significant"" of us may somehow be important to furthering the noble and good things in the world, to somehow make things better. Innocence and purity of spirit? That's a fantasy movie I can get behind. I feel better having watched it, surely that is a wonderful thing, better than any drug I know of.

562,hauptmann-1,psychological drama,8,14 July 2007,"****************HERE BE SPOILERS********* Perhaps I read too much into the film, but what I saw was the 'Narf' symbolized Giamatti's acceptance of the death of his wife & children at the hands of a murderer.He was a psychologist that, this time, needed to cure himself.The doctor was surrounded by all sorts of people with problems, and in the film, their problems manifested themselves as real people.I'm guessing the apartment complex is full of Giamatti's own patients.The cookbook writer really was dual-personality - he was his own sister. I'm guessing that the 'sister' was the 'real' one only because the brother was told 'your sister will have seven children, you will see two' - her dual will be gone by then.The crossword solver had inside him a kid that had been traumatized by his Dad having forgotten to pick him up from school - yet, in the film we see the kid.The student was 'living' with her mother, who was influencing her life to a major degree.'Story' was just that - a vehicle Giamatti used to cure his own patients, but this time he needed to create one for himself - to 'go home'.",Lady in the Water

Certain parts of the movie even moved me to tears. And as with all M. Night Shyamalan's movies, the acting was top-notch. Paul Giamatti deserves much credit for his performance, as do all of the supporting actors.Before I saw the movie, I read countless reviews that described the movie as almost laughable. I can understand how it would be laughable to some people. It would not be because it is a bad movie, it would be because of their expectations going into the theater. This movie, as with just about every other Shyamalan movie, does not follow the typical Hollywood formula in any way. But that is his niche, and he does it very, very well.My advice: If you're a fan of M. Night's other movies, this one will not disappoint. Ignore the people who are trying to put themselves intellectually above it, as is the case with just about every Shyamalan movie. There is so much to enjoy about this movie. Go into it with an open mind and take it for exactly what it is.",Lady in the Water
564,simon-875,A rare but very curious cinematic treat.,8,31 August 2006,"I watched this movie, without reading any reviews beforehand, on it's penultimate night on the second screen (of 2) in a small rural English theatre with six others people. I guess from that and the viewer rating on this site that the film hasn't made a great impact.I can see why that might be the case. It's very curious and rather hard to pin down. One gets the feeling no-one but a very bankable director or an A-List cast could have secured production in the first place. Imagine trying to pitch this one to the money-men? Shyamalan is undoubtedly a bankable name and he does write the most unusual and unexpected stories. He can certainly direct them with enormous effect but this really is a very hard film to sell! It's hard even to describe it to anyone who hasn't seen it and perhaps therein lies the reason so few people joined me on that rainy Wednesday evening. How does one pass on the joyful essence of this movie by word-of-mouth? How can it be described without sounding ridiculous?Two of my fellow watchers were ten-year-old kids complete with buckets of popcorn and baseball hats on backwards. I was a little surprised they chose this film at all when ANT BULLY was on the other screen and more amazed that after five minutes they'd quietened down and stayed right to the end. This is certainly a fairly tale but doesn't seem like the kind of movie a 10 year old would normally happily sit though until the action chimes in. This is, initially, a slow-burning film but it obviously hooked them in the same way it hooked me. That says much for it's quality.I left the theatre with a smile on my face. I enjoyed this movie. I enjoyed the ensemble acting, the comic moments, the chills and shocks, the demurely sexy Howard, the likable Giamatti and the sinister Balaban (doesn't Giamatti resemble Balaban in CLOSE ENTCOUNTERS?)I liked the on going battle between Cindy Cheung and her grumpy mother , the claustrophobic atmosphere, the stylish but understated cinematography. And I loved the ending which seemed to be perfectly timed and scored.But I still can't describe this movie adequately. To anyone who hasn't seen it yet I'd just have to say please do give it a shot.

People who love this movie must have lost their minds totally - and it has really made me a skeptic about the voting on this site ... The movie is badly directed. The acting is horrible. The 'Dark forces' in the movie are so laughable, wicked 'scrunts' punished by wicked, wicked monkeys ... you just don't believe it before you see it.

The interactions between characters serves no purpose to the film's plot, least of all the Critic (whose last words made me question what possessed Shyamalan to write this film). Story's mission to go home serves no purpose but to lengthen the film. The fairy tale itself is poorly constructed and random.

Nevermind the mythology, it is the point of the story and the characters that made the film. The point I get is that everyone has a purpose in life. That's all. Sure the characters seemed very ready to believe Cleveland when he told them what was going on, but maybe that's because something inside them wanted to believe and then meeting with Story had an effect on them just like it did with MNS character. Some people think that this movie was self-indulgent and a matter of ego for MNS, and if so, so what? One thing that stands out to me is that this site is filled with so many pretentious dicks who think their opinion is the end-all, be-all truth, and that everyone else is dumb for not agreeing with them. Different strokes for different folks. Some people may think that movies like XXX are great movies, then some people find movies like this to be true brilliance. Parts of our own personal character help us attach to some films, and not others. If you didn't like this movie, then you are probably not the kind of person this story was meant for. The people that M. Night meant this story to be for are the ones that get it.I know some smart-ass is about to comment and say this movie was meant for kids and for liking it I must be a kid too.

I think the number eleven is there so it must be connected to 9/11 and a man's communication problem is solved by facing his past and literally getting in contact with (hi)Story and blah blah blah.

The serial decline in the quality of his films has obviously had an inverted effect on the growth of the director's ego, to the point that no other voices - even a studio head - can influence a solid commitment to bad storytelling, casting, and cinematography.Hopefully, Shyamalan will be truly humbled to the point that he may actually collaborate with the producers and craftsmen on his future projects.

My family and I were really rooting for this movie since we make up bed time stories for our kids. A lot of my stories have been good enough to hold people's interest but I have never tried to turn a profit on them. Nor did I write myself into the screenplay so that the world has to suffer through my acting (AGAIN!).This movie was kind of like the cliff notes of Lord of the Rings or Narnia. The movie seeks to create an entire world full of alternate races of mythical creatures (and their history) like the Narnia books do. The only difference being that Narnia was defined in a large number of full length novels which build off of each other. This movie attempts to CRAM all the information about the way things work into this (hopefully) one movie. It seemed that the movie started out as one sentence regarding someone in the kid's swimming pool and that the rest of the movie was a desperate attempt to explain why and how.The one happy note is that this movie does succeed in putting adults AND kids to sleep so at least I got a good nap. Luckily this was my free rental for the month or I would have been REALLY perturbed.,Lady in the Water

So did it serve the purpose???...I don't know about the purpose or anything else, because when I was out of the hall I could not speak you know why? Because I was a victim of what we commonly call as MOVIE-MAGIC. How can a man come up with this kind of story??? M.Night is a genius he has entered the GREATNESS zone, where he elevates himself and defeats all his opponents (his critics) and his weapon of choice A BED TIME STORY. No wonder the GOD himself called for his help (""SIR STEVEN SPIELBERG"" called M.NIGHT to help him write Indiana Jones 4-Script).

But all you other people out there, you will most likely be disappointed.The storyline is extremely confusing and thin. It seems to be an improvised bedtime story where the storyteller try hard to save the story long enough so their child finally go to sleep. But it makes no sense, unless you're on drugs or extremely tired.The audience that i shared the moment with actually laughed out loud and commented the movie out loud to be miserable.

As with all of Shyamalan's movies this too is about finding yourself and finding your purpose within the world. Everything about the movie is tremendous although I have a feeling only a handful of people will feel this way, but it feels like Donnie Darko did when it was first released. I remember how horrible that movie did until word spread that it was actually worth watching and I honestly feel that, that is exactly what is going to happen with this movie. It will find a nice little cult following for the people that are looking for it. Amazing flick and definitely worth your time.",Lady in the Water

A fairy tale for adults that is so fantastic that it can drive you to tears! Just excellent! All who say that this film is bad, have not understand the message and the meaning of the film. This film is a counterstrike against the new wave of handy-snuff-violent-video-films like Hostel. Lady in the Water transports real feelings and goods.

There are good stories everyday (recently The Ringer, Benchwarmers), but with the execution of Mozart. His films progress to greatness with The Lady in the Water. He takes Paul Giamatti's weakness and creates strength. He takes everyday characters with their quirks and even stereo-types and makes them lovable and he does it with ease. The humor is real humor, not humor spurred on by sarcasm or defeat, and the whole theater laughed with him. He makes fun of himself, while eating film critics alive. The continuity of writing, directing and producing make it untouchable by the box. He does not have to use foul language, nudity or violence to display his work. M.

Everyone is integral to the story, however the journey was finding your role in the story. It is a sense of circumstantial ties that link humanity that director M. Night Shyamalan tells in his most recent tale, The Lady in the Water. His last film, The Village, studied the awesome force of love. Before that, Signs pondered faith. Unbreakable was a classic tale of Good verses Evil. These are the central themes that he wishes to focus on while at the same time telling his eerie tales. He is a very unique director and story teller. I see visceral raw human emotion wrapped around an Alfred Hitchcock type suspense. While you may be disappointed that the film won't scare you, or you are too old for fairy tales, think again. When M. Night Shyamalan tells a story, that story touches a chord with the soul.",Lady in the Water

The acting is so heartfelt and involved, and in addition, the film has one of the most effective musical soundtracks i have ever heard in a film, contributing tremendously to the overall experience.This is not a crowd pleaser film, not a mindless entertainment (not that those kinds of films are unenjoyable, sometimes that kind of film is just what you need), but a film like this touches the spirit and mind, if you are open to that, in a deeper way.Anthony Plumer",Lady in the Water

The film is good for the entire family; it plays like a fairy tale meets a ""Who Done It?"" Don't go in expecting too much and you'll leave very satisfied. Disney lost out on this deal. The professional critics are complaining about M. Night's extended cameo -- there's nothing wrong with acting in your own movies, especially if you can pull it off, and I thought he did -- and the lady I was with thought he was very easy on the eyes. There is a very humorous scene where the actor ""breaks the plane"" of suspension that the adults enjoyed immensely, and there is another good subplot of redemption. Take your family to the matinée and you will have a good time together.",Lady in the Water
583,XtraCrispi,What garbage....,1,30 July 2006,"A friend took me to this movie although I was not really interested in seeing it. I find that if I go in expecting crap I can at least come out thinking 'I'm pleasantly surprised it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.' That was far from the case here. LITW was really awful.This is how the creative process must have gone... 1. M. Night wrote this movie on the crapper - actually in interviews he said it was a bed time story he started making up piece by piece for his kids. Well it shows. There are many holes in the story that I wont go in to because I don't want to ruin it for anyone who does want to see this trash.2. ""I have this movie and I need to think of a name for it."" -""What's it about?"" -""This girl in a pool."" (2 mins of serious thought) -""I've got it... how about Lady in the Water."" How creative!I wish he wouldn't put himself in his own movies. If he can't see his limitations as a director or writer, one would hope he'd at least see his limitations as an actor. What horrible acting! He is doing all he can to model himself as the new Hitchcock but it just isn't happening. Putting yourself in a movie and having an aerial shot of the pool (a Hitchcock-esqe shot) doesn't make you the next Hitchcock.I am very tired and rather upset I spent good money on such a bad flick. It was a Sunday night at the movies and there were 15 other people in the theater and they all went 'ugh!' at the end and we all walked out talking about how bad it was. On the way home while stopped at a traffic light we saw two of the people that were in the theater and we started talking again. They had even said since leaving the theater they had not stopped talking about how bad it was. In case I haven't made my point. The movie... it's BAD.In essence he made it up as he went a lot, holes in the plot/story, Shamalan is in the movie way too much, and no ending. He wishes he was the character he wrote himself to be - the man who will alter the worlds perception with his writing. Not happening.",Lady in the Water

For those people who might try to take it too seriously, just remember it's advertised as a 'bedtime story'. I had been waiting for what seems like a very long time to see this movie since I first saw the trailer I don't know how long ago and I was not disappointed. I did stay until the very end to see if there was a scene at the end (which seems to have started with Ferris Bueller's Day Off and now I can never leave the theatre until the credits are completely finished rolling no matter what the movie is or who is waiting on me to get to the parking lot).

I am finding that his movies have always been ""message"" oriented... and this one was particularly odd in that he put himself in the film as the messianic character whose words would eventually bring about changes in the ""world of the land dwellers."" Is this arrogance, or does he see himself like this? At first I was annoyed at how slowly the story developed... until the first good joke. Bob Balaban's character was superb. M. Night's stories are always so full of misfits and misanthropes. This was no different. After ""The Village"" I had almost signed off on this filmmaker for good.

This premise is only slightly original and does not strike my interest. Based on what I saw in theatrical trailers, I went to this movie expecting a frightening, eerie movie of a lady who mysteriously appears out of the water to haunt an innocent man. The plot couldn't be much farther from a frightening, eerie movie, due to that the scariest part of the movie isn't even frightening whatsoever, but simply startling. This movie didn't come close to what I expected to be a thriller/horror film, due to that the plot revolves around a corny Asian folktale, with much detail left out of the picture. Even the introduction of the movie which attempts to explain this ""saga"" doesn't explain why all these people in the same apartment complex part of this great legacy of the lady in the water.

Everyone else was great as well.Two diversions from his usual formula. 1) He had a major role in the movie and 2)It was missing his usual reveal at the end, but it was still a fantastic movie.

The story is unique. And personally, I don't like Paul Giammati. I watched ""Sideways"" and thought, ""What a pathetic loser."" But there couldn't have been a better choice for this part. He played vulnerable very well. Maybe the media didn't like the movie because it didn't have the requisite STAR ACTOR to draw in the gullible crowds. Yes, the ""Beautiful People"" took a break on this movie. Most of the actors are regular people, not Tom Cruise or any of his wives, Mel Gibson, nor the like. I think a big name actor would have detracted from the story. So, if you like a good story with good acting, see this movie. My husband and I both enjoyed it.And one last thing, I read some of the comments on this page and didn't read one bad comment. So why this movie has a low rating, I have no idea.

After the severe disappointment of ""The Village"",I was thoroughly convinced this would be yet another over-advertised, under achieving film from M. Night Shyamalan. And, yet another movie with a creepy commercial leading you to believe it will give you chills. This time, however, I did not go expecting a horror movie, but a slight thriller. Still wrong!The movie opens with a sequence of black and white tribal drawings telling a story that seems to lead no where. Then, a slow-moving beginning attempts to build up, only to fall down-hill. Story, (""the lady in the water""), gives almost no direction to the stuttering super who finds her in the first place, yet, expects him to help her. The story changes so many times and moves so slow it becomes very hard to follow, and, with so many sub-plots you're not sure what to hope for. The slow pace is then awkwardly interrupted by a monster, or creature, trying to spice things up. This is where i'm lost.Quirky characters and a great performance by Paul Giamatii are the only things i enjoyed in this movie. It got more (uninteded) laughs than it did jumps or screams from the audience i viewed it with. It doesn't need a PG-13 rating because, the way i see it, any person mature enough to watch ""Harry Potter"" may find a new mythical story to love. But for horror,suspense, or good movie fans, i would not recommend this.",Lady in the Water

I think people expect way to much from directors anymore. Does everyone want Night to make another Sixth Sense. Sixth Sense wasn't even his best film. This movie uses imagination and you can get lost within its story. That's why I enjoy his movies. You can put yourself within the story. The movie isn't really scary it's more innocent. The musical score was incredible. I thank M. Night for sticking to his guns and making fascinating movies, no matter what. This movie is definitely worth seeing and buying on DVD. Young kids would enjoy it as well. So go and enjoy with an open mind and an open heart.",Lady in the Water
594,kruhft,finally a new 8 1/2,10,24 July 2006,"A totally amazing movie. Beautifully shot, wickedly abstract, symbolistic and mythological story, entrancing actress in the lead with a great supporting cast, and Slash (and you even get to see his face). I walked out of the theater with so much to think about and will definitely see it again (and again, and again).This is true cinematic art, hence my comparison to 8 1/2, but that comparison is also because of the similarities of creative technique between the two movies. No, the stories are not the same, but the idea of the director needing and wanting to make a new movie without an idea of where to go at times and just *doing it* to keep production going is refreshing and just might have come up with something new (or as close as we can get in the current age). This makes the story a bit confusing at times due to it's randomness, but that's what also made it fun for me because it just makes you think (and I don't love anything more than art that makes me think).I walked out of there thinking 'Movie of the Year', and hence my 10 rating. I know that will not be the general consensus of everyone that watches it, but it's nice to see directors doing things not just for everyone, but also for some of us that need to see that 'Yes, someone else get's it too' aka. artists and such.

595,pickleblaster,"Spectacular, Shyamalan does not disappoint",10,24 July 2006,"Now, as long as I remember, I have been a fan of the works of M. Night. Shyamalan. I loved the Sixth Sense, I loved Signs, I even loved The Village which everyone seems to dump on. So I entered the theaters with high hopes and expectations. They were met, in every way, shape and form. The movie started out quickly, with only a few minutes passing before he meets the lady in the water. Finding her quickly was a big relief, because most directors would lead up to it, taking away time from the story-line people could find out from watching a commercial or two. Thus leaving time for his many ideas to come forth.The events took place in unexpected ways and took unexpected forms, with something odd lurking around every corner. The film worked in ways you wouldn't believe, but, I must say, it had some truly strange characters. The amazing thing about Shyamalan is that he can make the strange characters act like normal people, only with strange characteristics. It made sense because everyone fit into the story so well. During the periods when suspense was the highest, Shyamalan added in small comical bits to lighten the mood.The movie is done very well, and I'm reserving a spot in my DVD collection for it. I would recommend this movie as something to see in theatersand at home, on a portable DVD player, and at random social eventsthat's righteverywhere.",Lady in the Water

Like i said before, the plot of the story is VERY far out there, but in my opinion it contributes to the greatness of the movie. IF YOU GO INTO THE MOVIE EXPECTING TO SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU BELIEVE IS REALITY, YOU WONT LIKE IT! Go into the movie expecting something creative and interesting.

There was no plot progression, and Bryce Dallas Howard plays EXACTLY the same person she did in the village, except being blind she was wet and nymph-y.

600,redmanna,A New Direction,7,4 August 2006,"First of all, I'll reiterate the premise of several other commenters I've seen on various sites---this movie is a fantasy, NOT a horror movie. I feel like a lot of the negative reactions I've heard from friends have revolved around unmet expectations in terms of shock value. What I found intriguing about this particular film was that M Night managed to tie a lot of the themes from his other movies into a very different kind of film than his previous works. The general idea behind his crazy twists seems to be the unpredictability of life. If you've seen this most recent film, I think M Night's general point about the unpredictable, often serendipitous nature of our world is solidified by his choice of who dies in the movie. The bottom line: life is unpredictable, it has no formula. We all get our fair share of curve balls, and often what we think we know of life gets flipped upside down or just thrown into the garbage can. Shymalan's choice of several smaller twists rather than one large twist in this film reflects well the overall message. While I did find some of the monster moments a bit over the top, its completely excusable because again, we're dealing with chance, not mathematics. A totally mathematical, rational, scientific world is boring, and M Night assures us that we don't live in one like that. While we don't live literally in a world of monsters, creatures etc. (as far as I know), we do live in a place dictated by something more magical/fantastic than what that movie critic character likes to believe. And while there is room for some fantasy, some magic, some chance, then there is also room for hope. And so that is M Night's magic, and while I won't call it the best movie I've seen this year, I will call it a film of hope, and a lighter, more positive endeavor on the director's part.",Lady in the Water

I am here to tell you that this is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. The story grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let go. And with the help from brilliant actors Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard, a score that WILL be nominated for an Oscar, you have what is truly a work of art.There are so many well crafted twist and turns throughout this adventure of a film, and they help stress one of the many themes of this movie: finding purpose.

I enjoyed it and cant wait to see the next M. Knight movie. Let's focus a little more on the talent of the actors, the intrigue of the story and the brilliance of the direction. It's a movie that draws you in and allows you to lose yourself in the lives of the characters, it helps you reflect on those people in your own life that seem to be living simple unremarkable lives but that have their own challenges.

Honestly, there were about seven people in total in the showing! All I got out of this movie was sheer disappointment. The only reason I went to watch this movie was because an old school friend wanted to meet up and we couldn't really think of anything else to do, we had both seen all the big titles of the summer.It's one of the worst films I have ever seen, I wouldn't be surprised if it went straight to DVD.",Lady in the Water

Lady In The Water is full of suspense and creativity. If you like watching a film that will keep you guessing, this is surly the film for you. The actors do a wonderful job at playing their part without giving away the story to the audience. It keeps the audience at the end of their seat looking for more clues. Once the credits begin, the viewers have to sit and stare at the screen for a while to put together everything they saw. I know I did.

I found this film pretty boring up until the ending which was great and wanted more action, more monsters and more fun overall. I wouldn't recommend this movie, but it had a kind of 80s feel to it which was cool. The last ten minutes beats the rest of the whole film. Village was definitely better. Unbreakable I'm not sure. If you're going to watch this based on the cover of the DVD like I did, prepare to be disappointed. A fantastic idea and Shyamalan seems not to have made the most of it. The intro is a (much less inspiring) copy of the Watership Down cartoon intro animation and the whole film is a bit of a joke really. As a fairy tale, it just lacked the magic I want out of a fantasy story. ""Story"" - the main character bored the hek out of me and it was just same thing again and again. The archetypal ideas were quite cool though and I want to give Shyamalan some credit. Maybe 3 was a bit harsh, but I have to say I forwarded most of the movie because I wasn't up for it.",Lady in the Water
606,abinandhan-1,For the Educated!,10,21 September 2006,"This is a totally different movie from M.Night.Shyamalan. He was criticized for his stereo-typed endings of each of his films. May be he was forced to take a movie like this. No matter what, he has done a creditable job. There are a few things that need to be pointed out here. 1. This is not a horror movie and so do not rate it in that perspective. 2. One has to accept the fact that the movie is portrayal of a bed-time story coming to life. What would we do in case it happens is what is shown. 3. Questioning the possibility of such an occurrence just for the sake of it is pointless, simply because we have already accepted so many such concepts for a movie's sake and made it huge hits, like (a) we believed aliens in alien, (b) Jedi and Darth in star wars, (c) the bullet time concept in Matrix and so many futuristic movies. Characterization in the movie is good, and the music is even better. The rising tone of the background music followed by silence to emphasize the intensity of the scene in progress is unique of the director's style of movie making. True, the movie lacked a racy screenplay, but was one needed for this movie in the first place? Common, this ain't a Bourne ultimatum! On the whole, i think the director has done the best possible job given this storyline, and makes me wonder few would have bettered it, may be the likes of Spielberg, Kurosawa, etc...",Lady in the Water
607,laurie_plan,Lady in the POOL??,3,18 October 2006,"I should offer an extra warning here, the main issues i discuss here are all plot related so this is a big spoiler.'Lady in the water' is the latest offering from director M.Night Shyamalan, an Indian born but American raised director, whom audiences might best remember from 'The sixth sense'. He also was the subject of a documentary, or what turned out to be a mockumentary in 2005, entitled, 'The buried secret of M.Night Shyamalan'. Amongst other supernatural entanglements, the film suggested that Shyamalan was obsessed with the idea of water in his films, because of the drowning death of a young boy near his home when he was eleven. So the fact that this film was steeped in water, and what I mistakenly believed from the trailer to be horror, was of immediate interest.For those of us, who like me, were led astray, this is not a horror film. It is actually kind of a modern day fantasy. I think the best way to let you know what your in for is a brief situation run-down. There are these creatures called 'nerfs' which live in water, but seemingly at random, they will come out of the water to fly up to heaven as a phoenix, which saves man-kind, and this is what the nerf (played by Choudhury) is doing. The funny thing is that this nerf doesn't live in a lake or stream or something - she lives in the pool at the bottom of an apartment building. However that's quite lucky because it turns out the caretaker of the building, who used to be a doctor, is the 'healer', and can help her turn into the phoenix.Now the only problem is that there are creatures called 'scrunts', which is a red-eyed wolf, made out of grass, who hate nerfs and when nerfs come out of the water, they will try to kill them. The scrunts are only supposed to attack the nerfs during the night, however, because this particular nerf is a 'queen nerf' - if she manages to get through she will be a fantastic inspiration to all the other nerfs, who presumably also live in swimming pools - the scrunt is breaking the rules and attacking during the day. There are these other green creatures, although these looked like they were made from green wood, who are the most evil creatures in the world. I can't remember what they are called, but lets call them 'chuzwazzas'. Anyway these evil chuzwazzas are supposed to kill the scrunt if he attacks during the daytime, however they don't do this till the end. The chuzwazzas live in the gnarled forest that this apartment block also backs on to.Anyway, the pool sweep toting, janitorial 'hero', 'Doctor' Cleveland, gets told this whole story by a Chinese lady that lives in the building, but she never meets the nerf or is even told by Cleveland about her, for some reason she just starts spouting this story to Cleveland, who cleverly puts two and two together, and realizes that must be what's happening in this instance.The scrunt nearly gets the nerf a few times, but luckily, she has this special mud which heals her. There is also a guild, an interpreter, and a protector to help her. The protector is a body-builder who only works on one arm. Shyamalan also plays a character in this film, the writer. He is the one who will write so that the nerf may fly. The nerf asks him if he wants to know the future. He does, so she dutifully tells him that he's going to die, and that his sister will have 7 kids, and he will live to see 2 of them. He thanks her.In case you haven't realised by now, its the plot of this film that completely lets it down. Its not that its a fantasy. A lot of fantasy films are really great. However even fantasy films must have some sort of coherence, and a path of logic, that once established, it does not deviate from. This film just kept moving the goal posts and demanding too many leaps of faith from the audience. I just kept thinking that I must have fallen asleep and missed half an hour of this, which I almost did! For example, all the people who end up helping this nerf, just accept it as fact that she is a magic nerf that lives in the pool, without ever questioning it. But the fact they don't question it is not explained. They must say that 'people who are destined to help will know instinctively that they are so' or something like that. Wherever you twist reality you have to reconcile it with the audience, and this film never does.The acting in this film is quite good, especially newcomer Choudhury; man that is an annoying name though, it had better be real. Paul Giamatti stars as Doctor Cleveland the janitorial hero, and does a reasonable job, but I feel like there's just nothing here for him to work with. Even so though, he didn't blow me away, something about his screen presence was just a bit bland. Shylamalan does as reasonable job as his poe-faced serious wide-eyed doomed author character, but he doesn't speak much. Nor do any of them actually.Visually, this film is shot quite nicely, although the CGI on the ferocious grass dog, and the tacitly evil but belatedly helpful green wood tree men, leaves something to be desired. I dunno what to say, this was one that I had floated a lot of hope upon, but, it turned out to be a real sinker, I mean stinker. ; )",Lady in the Water
608,FDidriksen,Brilliant!,10,27 September 2006,"I won't say its better than ""The Village"" or badder! Its an entirely different movie. The pictures, the music, the plot of ""The Village"" was breathtaking.But the characters, the feelings, and the demonstration of collaboration between people, only connected because they live the same place, is awesome.Just watch the movie. I left the cinema with renewed energy. And i can't hardly wait for this brilliant writer and director to do another movie.If you like a good bedtime story, don't miss this one!",Lady in the Water
609,cleermethod,Now that's Better,10,14 January 2007,"OK, so truthfully M. Night is not my favorite director. To me there is such a thing as twisting the hell out of a story. And as he seemed to get further and further into his career, the twists just got too ridiculous. OK, I don't really need to talk about these movies, but to explain my unbiased opinion, I am going to describe my appreciation for the past films I have seen of his. I liked the Sixth Sense, thought it was a good movie. Unbreakable, to me, was the best he'd done through the Village. Then he took a plunge with Signs. It was good, but I wasn't thrilled with it. The Village, now that movie almost made me angry. So, I didn't see Lady in the Water in the theaters. And I hesitated on renting the movie after it came out on DVD. I didn't know anything of the story at all because frankly, I was not interested. One day I was in Hollywood video and I saw it, and couldn't hinder the battle of whether or not I should rent it in my head, so I did. WOW... It was absolutely stunning. A completely original tale full of imagination. I loved the characters, everybody had such a unique and interesting story. M. Night left nothing out. He covered every detail. Plus once again, there was a monster in this movie, HOWEVER this one was terrifying, not ridiculous. And yes, there was a twist, but this time it was all too appropriate. It just pushed me to the edge of my seat even more. I have to say, when I finished watching it, I really could have started it right back from the beginning and watched it again. In comparison, the story had a fantasy to it that would compare to The Never Ending Story. The movie was absolutely brilliant. Not to mention the tale that the movie is based off of comes from a children's story- which M.Night ALSO wrote. Very good",Lady in the Water
610,alde_64,What people miss while watching this movie,10,19 October 2006,"Imo its a serious mistake to flag LinW as a deep down fairy tale movie like majority of comments seem to point out here. Definitely it is a way to see things, after all, it had been reclaimed publicly to be one, though. Yet, I fail to understand how big of an impact does the fairy tale scenario actually have for this movie. True, without having this, it might not make much sense, but 'cataloguing' it as a simple fairy tale movie with a goodie, baddies and people with extraordinary powers is just a way to overlook the whole point, imo. So what is the point ? The point is pretty straight forward really, as I see it. It's the ultimate 'what has happened with the world?' type of deal. You can't have another movie which would explain that problem better than LinW does, and last but not least, it succeeds in doing it through a one-man-made myth and definitely through a perfectly written and played out dialog which brings up questions about our nowadays world, tries to answer them and through all those questions eventually tries to point out the weak points about the world in which every single one of us lives today. The lack of originality in world, people who are scared and/or doubting about their purpose or even if they have any, people who are scared to act out and rather flee somewhere where no one knows them, people who are being disappointed about the world and even going as far as wanting to be an innocent child again, new thoughts that will shake the world at one point and through what a new leadership will arise or naturally the idea about unlocking people's abilities - Those are just several among many ideas this movie so genuinely points out. I guess you'd be lying, if you'd say that you haven't thought about things like those yourself. Furthermore, as someone mentioned before, at this time, the idea about 'finding ones purpose' is more and more poignant. Basically, you can go on saying how not scary it was, how nice of a make-believe it was and so on. But in that case, though, you'd misunderstand completely why this ideal flick was even done. Kudos to mister S for making yet another perfect movie without showing any signs of running out of ideas, even vice versa, this movie was completely his making from top to bottom. A myth written from scratch.",Lady in the Water
611,Ryancoke25,"One of the best movies I have seen in a while, and definitely not what I expected.",10,1 January 2007,"Although I am not a fan of any of M. Night Shyamalan's other movies, this one blew me away. Some of the previews I saw for LITW made it seem more like a horror movie than what it turned out to be, and although the storyline moves slowly in this film, it is very well presented and methodical. The cinematography is very well done and the way in which the characters are built up and initially presented is especially well done. The actors chosen for this film are nothing short of perfect for their roles, and the ""Lady"" herself has a very mythical aura about her. The CGI in this movie is also quite well done. I'm sure that if you are a person with a bit of patience for the storyline to build, that you will also throughly enjoy this movie. And although I thought that I was renting a Horror movie, this movie was not a disappointment, and it even had it's scary moments. All in all, I still think that Shyamalan's other movies aren't very good, but with that said, this is one bedtime story that you will not want to miss out on.",Lady in the Water
612,secrettruth,The film is a beautiful modern free-form fairy tale.,9,24 September 2008,"I think the reaction this film had worldwide is very ironic. The film is a beautiful modern free-form fairytale with all Campbell-esk avatars and a well-executed heroes journey. The problem eventually came down to one thing, the role that the filmmaker gave himself. Light Spoiler warning: M. Night plays a writer who's work changes the world, and if anybody but the director of this film played the role, no one would have cared, and the film would have had a great reaction. Do we scoff when Bruce Willis saves the world over and over? Do we think he has delusions of grandeur? He surely picks the scripts and roles he plays! But if a director chooses a role he thinks would be interesting to play (and let's face it he has always like to jump in front of the camera, look at his first feature) then the whole world pans the film because of it (and he wasn't even the lead). So a critic dies in the film, big deal  it was supposed to be ironic. He was playing into specific motifs that were adapted for modern times. Once everyone gets past that, what they will get is a very well made, both cinematically and well-written modern fairytale with a central core of love, faith, hope, and unity. It is a very sweet film, and all the characters are very well developed and unique, which is refreshing after seeing the Happening (which I thought, was a flat, messy film with a good moral.). I personally found it very fun to watch. The casting was strange (and I DON'T mean M.Night being the writer) and there was some funny moments, same dark moments. It's an adult fairytale, no less  it's predictable, but all fairy tales are. People have to stop taking things so seriously and just enjoy a good story. Some people commented on the lack of bringing the audience into the world, making it believable. When will anyone believe that a water nymph comes from another world to inspire a writer? I quite liked how it doesn't try to be over-fantasy in its execution, and keeps things on a real level. If this became Stardust or Harry Potter mid way through it would have fell flat. By keeping it real it makes it much more believable then people gave it credit for. The film only asks one thing of you, to allow yourself to go on a ride and not question every little thing. If the fact that M. Night plays a character in the film annoys you, then you're missing the point of films altogether. Besides, he's an OK actor",Lady in the Water
613,KrisHole,what a let down,3,28 December 2006,In my opinion the the best film made by M.Knight.Shamalan is Signs. When i saw Unbreakable at the cinema i had to restrain myself from walking out on it. If you want to see a good film and don't want to feel like you have just wasted your precious time do not see this film. Lady in the water was so over the top i couldn't help but add my own commentary throughout the film to make it more interesting. The acting was below average especially with MKS acting. His character was so dull and uninteresting. All i could picture was MKS in an acting class doing terrible dialog and at which point he decided that he was good enough to star in his own film. I hope that he does not have a repeat performance. I don't think this film deserves a 6 on IMDb. M.Knight.Shamalan has his moments in films...this is not one of them.,Lady in the Water

615,michiel-vanaalderen,poor storyline,5,4 January 2007,"Knight Shyamalan has proved himself to be one of the most original writers/producers out there. The sixth sense was brilliant, and in my opinion, Signs was even better. But after these movies things started to go downhill rapidly. Unbreakable was not able to impress, nor was the village, which I must admit I found better than Unbreakable. However Shyamalan proves things can even get worse with lady in the water. The scenario is so weak, that I have a hard time accepting that an actor like Paul Giamatti lent his acting skills to this movie. In the beginning, it is still quite credible, but as the movie progresses it gets weaker and weaker. Even though the genius of Shyamalan still somehow manages to radiate through the thin storyline every now and then, he fails to live up to the expectations. Either Shyamalan should spend more time (under less commercial pressure) working on his stories, to perfect them, or he should arrange a bigger budget to make a more elaborate movie.",Lady in the Water

I wish more people could see this and appreciate the way it portrays the hope we all have inside for a better world where people care for each other, and for all people. I also wish this could be less than 10 lines as I run out of things to say entirely too early.

617,szndbad,Another plot less and pointless fantasy movie,2,20 February 2007,"Definitely one of the worst movies ever.It is strange, it is not conventional in the sense of mixing ""bed-time"" stories and imaginary creatures with modern world. So far nothing that might sound bad about it, right? But the way the story unfurls is so artificial and predictable, the way the supernatural creatures are unveiled and the whole construct of their imaginary world is so awful, that a 3-years old child could do better.The plot is ridiculous, the characters are linear and lack any depth, are merely outlines of some stereotype. (All right, in this kind of movie there is no need for complex characters.) To make it brief: the worst about the characters is the uptake of this (nowadays) very fashionable motive of ""misunderstood or unknown Saviour"", who doesn't know who he/she is, but has a purpose that he/she is bound discover and fulfill. Sort of loser who becomes overnight a ""Random Messiah"" - in this case the caretaker Cleveland Heep.And another recurring idea, I am getting really tired of: the continuous self-victimization that summarizes today's American culture and identity and which eventually channels into violence (in other movies) or most of the time (like in this one) condemns the character to an existence as a loser, see Cleveland Heep, again.All in all, I didn't award this **** mark 1 just because visually I found the picture very well polished and elaborated. Still, I'm going to criticize this too: a good picture is merely a matter of technique, an excellent picture is a matter of poetry. And this one is just a piece of technique.",Lady in the Water
618,aewardiv,"Embracing Innocence, Compassion, and Altruism",6,19 June 2008,"Sub-par fare from Shyamalan that still deals in his important themes of tragedy, fear, heroism, and innocence. As with all of his films, seemingly ordinary people rise to heroic proportions by overcoming their tragic pasts and resultant fears through embracing innocence, compassion, and altruism. Shyamalan teaches us that no matter what tragedies we have experienced and how afraid we may be, each of us has a purpose and an ability to be courageous on behalf of others. There is much to learn from Shyamalan whether we are schooled through first-rate treatments such as the Sixth Sense (1999), underrated pictures like Unbreakable (2000) and The Village (2004), or middling fare like the Lady in the Water (2006).

Not even Giamatti could save them here.How long does it take the eagle to land? See that part again and enjoy the laughs. Must of had trouble finding the address.One final thought - just how much trouble did this stupid narf cause everyone in this complex?

620,rosencrantz905,best to watch if you're a Shyamalan fan,6,18 June 2007,"Lady In The Water is very much like The Village  it starts slow and dull but then you can't help being pulled in when things begin to speed up a little, despite the growing ridiculousness of the plot.The bedtime story which the film revolves around, develops into something much more complicated and it does seem a little tricky to follow. Because of this, it's easy to become distracted from the magic of the story and just try and work out what's going on. Despite this though, it still keeps you drawn in enough to reach the climax of the film.Paul Giamatti carries the film by playing the stuttering caretaker and helps to ground it a bit more. Bryce Dallas Howard is decent enough as the role of Story the narf, as are the rest of the cast, although none of them really stand out.Shyamalan loves to use unconventional shots in his films, but, as with The Village, this is where the film falls. The majority of these shots are used in the first half and so it is immediately hard for the audience to connect with it. A more traditional approach is taken for the majority of the second half, which assists in building the climax and involving the audience more.James Newton Howard's score is one of the best components of the film, although the two never feel like they fit together. The music seems like it's possibly too neat for it.On the whole though, it is worth a watch if you're a fan of Shyamalan and understand his imagination and more unusual style of film-making. If you've never seen one of his films before, I wouldn't watch this one first.",Lady in the Water

I don't understand how someone can invest money in something like this. Night Shymalan should now that this is crap. Its just as awful as the hour of power at Sunday morning.

The problem probably was that it was marketed as a horror film which it is not. It is an excellent fantasy film at par with many the recent fantasies....and certainly far more better than Twilight. I guess people dumped the movie in peer pressure as there was this phase when dumping Shyamalan was a fad. His worst movie was Avatar... certainly not this one. I would rate it better than ""The sign"" or ""Unbreakable"". Watch this movie and decide for yourself whether its good or not. I wrote this review as I did not see any other review.

624,wheresirenssleep49,Imagination is more powerful than knowledge.,10,28 February 2011,"If you don't understand this film or what it is about or think it's illogical, let me explain.. This film is about finding wonder and magick in the ordinary. It is also about ""purpose"". Obviously, being able to find wonder in the ordinary is a source of purpose and hope. It is what makes a child innocent, pure, and childlike and what makes a person feel alive.There are hints all throughout the movie that clearly explain so many of it's meanings.. why it confused people I have no idea.Even the part where the Asian girl tells Heep he has to act innocent and like a child to win the trust of her mother so that her mother will tell him the story is a hint.Reading prophecy from the cereal boxes was not absurd either. Again, it was about finding wonder and the unordinary in the ordinary.. about the power of the imagination to heal and to create.In most fantasy movies mages use crystal balls to scry prophecy and the future, but who says children cannot use cereal boxes? Both are just tools that set the imagination free. Really, it doesn't matter what tool you use. That's why it doesn't matter this is taking place in an apartment building in the most unlikely of places to the most unlikely people.And why do they believe? She obviously has magnetic power over them. The writer only needed to be introduced to her for her to stimulate her ""awakening"" in him. That was all. Then she was ready to go home. They didn't even have to talk. Heep's stuttering mysteriously stopped anytime he was simply in her presence. Yes, she seemed ordinary, but she clearly wasn't. Why is it so hard to imagine this effect would not spread to the other residents? Water faeries, in case you do not know, are known for their magnetic, irresistible power to seduce. Have you never heard of the evil sirens that lure sailors to their deaths with sweet songs? This film could be about many things of course and everything is subjective, but these are just a few of the meanings I saw in it. This film seemed a touch inspired by the classic Neverending Story by Michael Ende. I am very curious if Night is familiar with Ende's work. Certainly, Indians are more spiritual and their religious literature is littered with talk of nymphs, fae, and spirit beings of all kinds so they are more spiritually minded and open I guess than most westerners. His Indian background is becoming very evident to me the more of his movies I see.Night Shyamalan is good and he does not at all deserve all the hatred he is getting. So many worse movies come out constantly and even if you think these movies aren't like Sixth Sense or don't understand them, they're still more imaginative and creative than most the drivel that comes out of Hollywood. You could hardly honestly call any of his movies bad in comparison to most others, so why is everyone picking on him? Because you think he's egotistical for starring in his own movies? xD What about you for acting like such a know it all and getting so offended by that? That's not just a tad bit egotistical? As if all these critics complaining and attacking him do not have egos. xD I do think he's simply creating unique art more these days and using his artistic license because true artists desire to experiment and not submit to convention, but that's where the critics always try to come in and destroy someone's creative spirit and act like they know it all when what do they really ever know? Their opinions are no better than anyone else's and everyone sees something different when they look at something. Perception is subjective and it always will be. You can't put walls and chains around the act of creation as so many try to do. So many have lost their true purpose, are only acting out a caricature of what they think others want them to be, and this is why.. the critic is more than the destroyer of stories.. he is the destroyer of dreams. I doubt most caught on to the even deeper meaning of the critic character in this movie.. he could represent not only the authoritarian literary and film critic, but the jaded cynical scientific and tyrannical materialist.. the jaded cynical pessimist.. the cynical dogmatist that comes in all shapes and sizes.. In killing the critic of the story, MSN was restoring hope and wonder to what has become the lifeless and mundane and hopeless world of mankind. Ponder that. He is the messiah of his own story, and I see nothing wrong or egotistical in that. We are all Gods of our own stories. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so is art.This movie takes a bit of imagination to enjoy. Set your imagination free, the way children tend to do, and maybe you'll see it clearly. Then maybe after watching it you'll be rewarded with that childlike sense of wonder again for a moment that has become such a fleeting feeling in your stale and corrupted cynical adult life. Movies like this don't come along often. MNS is deep. Way too deep for most to understand apparently. People think he's insulting their intelligence when actually he's trying not to. :-/ But you know it's a bad argument when someone has to resort to character attacks and accusations that a person is ""egotistical"" to try to prove their point.Thank you M. Night, for being true to your art and not selling out for the sake of pleasing others.

I watch it every few months because it just draws me in...it's fantasy, not meant to reflect reality, just enjoy the beauty of it! The characters are really easy to get into, although the reader of the signs reading the signs on boxes of cereal was a little far fetched but who cares? It was fun!Why are there so many people down on this movie?

626,goddessalien,A whimsical break from reality,7,11 August 2006,"Presenting the concept of ""destiny"" to an audience is a tricky process. The filmmaker must be able to suspend the disbelief of the moviegoers, even the skeptical ones, and pull them into a universe where fate exists explicitly, and each character has purpose and meaning. In M. Night Shayamalan's Lady in the Water, ""destiny"" holds true. If you have seen other works of Shayamalan's, you will recognize it as a common theme in his films, most notably within ""Signs."" While not a fan of ""Signs"" myself, I enjoyed ""Lady in the Water."" I felt a small tingle at the base of my neck as I waited for each piece of the puzzle to come together, wondering to myself ""who will this person turn out to be?"" The time spent discovering each character does make the movie drag a bit, but while some critics have complained that this is filler for too simple a plot line, I feel that the combination of the lives and personalities of these characters are what gives the movie it's heart.Paul Giamatti's performance is subtle but beautiful to behold. It is often said that this actor does not get the recognition he deserves, but I hope that viewers will be able to appreciate his skill with this role. He is able to present a broken man that slowly begins to build within himself, as well as the audience, that small events and small people can offer hope for the future. Bryce Dallas Howard also shines as a catalyst for that change, pulling the colorful characters of a small apartment community together in their efforts to aid her. If whimsy isn't your cup of tea, then maybe this movie isn't for you. Like any fairytale, there are archetypes that fall just a bit too smoothly into their roles, and there are always a few loose ends left lying around. The story is simple, but it is the interaction between the characters that makes this film go from predictable to enjoyable. I was able to let go of the real world for a bit, and if you think you can too, then I suggest giving this movie a try.",Lady in the Water
627,WilliamSchweitzer,Overrated Film From An Overrated Writer/Director,3,12 August 2006,"""Lady In The Water"" seems to be little more than a poor excuse to stroke Shyamalan's own ego by writing himself into the script as a noble writer who's work will change the world so much that he becomes a martyr. The story seems like he's making things up as he goes along, with new rules and characters in the fairy tale surrounding the ""lady"" every ten minutes.Paul Giamatti did an outstanding job in making an absolutely terrible and pointless script watchable. He is an incredible talent, and certainly deserves to be recognized for his work. As for Shyamalan, he has always been hit and miss. His supporters will sing the praises of even the most average and ordinary of films (Signs, Unbreakable) as well as his heavily Rod Serling inspired movie twists (The Village, The Sixth Sense), but Lady In The Water falls under neither category. It is not average, nor does it have a twist of any kind, stolen or otherwise.With this film, Shyamalan attempted to create an ""ET"" for a new generation, and failed miserably. I would compare this film to unsatisfying sex , in that it feels like a lot of buildup with no release (or point) at the end. This film will be all but forgotten by this time next year.I would advise anyone to not bother wasting their time. This film falls flat on every level. When the credits came on screen in my theater, just about everyone in the crowd, including several children, looked around each other and said ""was that it?"" and ""what was the point?"". I am left wondering the same.",Lady in the Water
628,TrueHorror29,A good little original movie,8,18 July 2006,"This movie will surely earn its detractors due to its slow story telling. Todays audiences become bored the second something does not explode or die. This film isn't going to be a broad hit but instead it feels like a curious little independent film with big studio backing. Its more so a tale of finding ones purpose and will to live on as opposed to the fairy tale story that is ultimately its background. A nice change of pace from the stuff like ""Little Man"" and ""Mission Impossible III"". Not all movies are going to be liked by everyone, but given the chance Lady in the Water will find its following and make them feel a little bit better after seeing it.",Lady in the Water
629,KennyfieldHeroes,A stupid thriller film that's worth throwing into the trash can,3,4 October 2010,"The Good: Some action can amaze the viewer, puzzle-style scenes can be fun to watch The Bad: Not much is introduced in the beginning, the story's good, but ruined by the director's direction and acting, the types of people needed to send Story back to the Blue World gets confusing later in the story, the director's reliance on his kids to make the plot can/may not cause the movie to be taken seriously or get viewers to believe in the movie's movie world, the characters surprisingly believe in the Blue World stuff even though they had not thought about it The Ugly: Story's appearance is poorly done and her hair color changes in the end may be confusing.Conclusion: Lady in the Water is yet another failure for Mr. M.

630,YarkoTheWarbler,"Deacon Pan Demonium says: ""FUNNY LADY!""",2,1 October 2007,"From mid September on the BoardsI just saw The Lady In The Water, and I must say I was pleasantly surprised... It's about time M. Night tried his hand at making a comedy, and this one is a laugh riot!! I waited until this one came on HBO because I thought it would be another obvious, self-indulgent exercise in tedium like ""Unwatchable"" or ""The Village Idiots"". But, the more I watched TLITW, I realized that it was actually a brilliant Zucker Brothers-style spoof. I was only disappointed that Leslie Nielsen didn't get the role of Cleveland Heep. In his short career, M. Night Shyamalan has created a sort of genre of his own, and that is the key to the brilliant comedy that is The Lady In The Water. Much as ""Blazing Saddles"" was a spoof of Westerns, or ""Scary Movie"" a spoof of Horror films, this movie satirizes M. Night Shyamalan movies! That's right, Mr. Shyamalan has finally taken his storytelling gifts to a bold new place: Self-Parody!!! And it is funny, funny stuff!! Night takes a satirical look at the heavy-handed symbolism, painfully contorted plots, and maudlin sentimentality that have been downfalls of even his best work. From the insultingly simple-minded moralism to the racial insensitivity, the yuks just keep coming. Just the names (narfs, tartutic) were enough to keep me in stitches throughout this zany, madcap farce. Especially hilarious is the role Harry Farber (Bob Balaban). Normally, creating a character who is a critic that exists only to say mean things and then die violently would seem bitter and immature, written by an overly sensitive artist who can't stand criticism. Instead, the Farber character is obviously meant as a parody of such insecurity. Why, I haven't seen such a comical ""f-you"" to critics since Godzilla 1998's ""Mayor Ebert"" and his Aide ""Gene"". So, if it is an uproarious laugh-fest you're looking for, look no further. This is one funny ""Lady"".",Lady in the Water
631,rehaxton,Very Good,7,24 July 2006,"I too found the movie to be very good. It is refreshing to see someone take a stab at something different. First the critics pan for being to commercial and then they pan for being too different. Imagination is what M. Night is showing, and I'm glad that he was able to get his vision to screen. Seems like today no one has imagination and can just sit back and enjoy a good story. I read one critique saying the characters in 'The Cove,' were stereotypical...then I guess the tenants in the surrounding buildings in Rear Window, were stereotypical too. Were the characters entertaining is the question? Did they keep you engaged? Were you curious about them...why would a guy just develop one side of his body.I like M. Night Shyamalan's work, but I'm no Kool-Aid drinking follower. I just think his stories work. Sometimes not everything, like in Signs where very intelligent beings don't first check the weather conditions on Earth and bring a rain coat, but over all he's a very good story teller.My only disappointment with Lady In The Water, is Shyamalan being in the movie with a big role. He's not a very good actor. Stick to writing and directing. I found him distracting, because he cannot act and it was drawing me away from the story.So, I would give it a 7 overall.",Lady in the Water
632,scottspearl,Seen for what it is- an amazing film!,10,22 July 2006,"Remember when you were just a child and you would be read or told a fairy tale? for most of us those times were filled with wonder and magic, when we were at an age where we could accept the ""rules"" of the world the story took place in- before our enjoyment was clouded with cynicism and analysis of whether what we were hearing was actually possible. In watching this film, M Night Shyamalan asks us to return to that time of wide eyed innocence and believe- if only for a couple of hours- that ""some stories are real!"" If you are planning to see this movie expecting something creepy like Night's previous films, you may well be disappointed. this is not a horror movie, a thriller, or a ghost story. it is just what Night himself has always called it- a bedtime story. It has its moments of hold-your- breath suspense, and even a few jump scenes that make it fun, but most of the more memorable scenes in this film are filled with magic and wonder. It is a beautiful movie,and a bedtime story that i would love to have in book form to read to my children. In the end, like every good bedtime story (and every Shyamalan film) it has a meaning that goes beyond the context of the story that will hopefully inspire us all to seek out and embrace our purpose in this world, seeing that each of our lives has an impact on everyone else's.",Lady in the Water

I, for one, found The Village, an enjoyable movie. Interesting plot, symbology out the wazoo, and delightful casting. Bryce Dallas Howard really captured my attention with her role of Ivy. Lady in the Water was really nifty story. Had you guessing the whole time. I knew there wasn't going to be a big plot twist at the end (because it seems that people are associating Shyamalan with Plot Twist), but the subtle plots throughout the movie made it seem like a fairy tale (which is what it was supposed to be) and I loved it.I would recommend this movie to anyone that would like to see a movie about hope and inspiration, which are some of the symbolic elements of the movie.Can't wait for his next project!",Lady in the Water

My only question was why would they make the previews and commercials make the movie look scary, and actually serious...but make the movie a TOTAL JOKE?? Now, don't get me wrong, that was the best laugh I've had in YEARS, and it was actually pretty fun to watch, but they should have warned the people that there will be A lot of comedy in it. 1 star overall for a horror movie. 4 stars for a comedy, so just about in the middle, overall 2 STARS, go figure.

This movie tries to bring to life a bedtime story or a girl who lives in his pool and came from another world. The only thing keeping this movie together (and not sending it straight to DVD) is Paul Giamatti. The movie starts slow and continues that way for the duration of its 73 minutes. I'm glad I didn't pay for this garbage. Horrible movie, absolutely terrible. Pointless from the beginning. My Super ex-girlfriend was better than this trash. I guess I have to write a few more lines about this awful movie because I haven' written 10 lines yet. There isn't much else to say except the acting is horrible, the characters are all people who obviously do not question anything. I suppose its a fantasy and not in any way representing of real life.

Yes, people may want to kill him, but it's definitely not because he's written something that will change the world. (it doesn't help that he's not much of an actor, either) 2) Narf? Are you kidding me? People are supposed to hear that without laughing? 3) I watch movies because I want to be entertained or moved or see something intriguing, not because I want to walk away from it dumber than I was before.I hope Shamalayn's ready to soak up ever bad review because by jove, he's earned it.",Lady in the Water

Night Fan but this movie SUCKED!,3,24 July 2006,"this movie was a royal piece of crap. i felt cheated and robbed of my 8 bucks. i was really in the mood to see a good, substantive movie. but this piece of feces that was hurled at me severely disappointed. I loved Signs and Unbreakable. They had a lot of build-up and a slow pace but you were glad you had been so patient because it led up to something amazing. this movie had the same slow build-up and pace and it led up to absolutely jack-$h!t. and the switching between who was the healer and who was the guardian and who was the damn guild. WHO GIVES A RATS ASS!??? and the little oddities like why the guy only worked out one arm and all that stuff, none of it tied together at all. when the theater people raised the lighting I couldn't believe it, I thought ""wait, its not done, is it!? turn the lights back down!"" but I was wrong, it was over and it was 2 hours of my life I can never get back.

638,WJArvay,A bedtime fable worth seeing,7,13 March 2007,"Not everyone will like this film. I happened to think it is a small gem, and that it will grow in popularity and esteem as more people come to know it. However, it seems to have been marketed as a scary, horror thriller, which does it an injustice. I almost missed it because of the hype, and my teenage daughter skipped watching the DVD with me, because she does not like ""scary movies."" She was clearly misled.It's hard to categorize Lady in the Water. Suffice it to say that the author himself calls it a bedtime story.I predict that you will enjoy this film if you have enjoyed: - The Princess Bride - Paul Giamatti's characters - Rod Serling's Twilight Zone - Stephen King's ""It""Like the Princess Bride, Lady in the Water is a romantic fable about love, but not about romantic love. The love in this film is love of neighbor, a good Samaritan kind of love.Paul Giamatti is the core and fiber of this film. No other character is developed as much as his character. He plays a Jimmy Stewart for our generation, a bumbling everyman with a core of integrity and humble good will.To me this movie resembles the best of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone. It's an eerie morality play, where the audience gladly suspends their disbelief in order to enter the author's realm. It also strongly reminds me of Stephen King's ""It"" (read the book, rather than watch the mini-series)in that it follows a band of outcasts whose characters grow enormously as they discover their own latent talents in a foreign world that exists just beyond the perceived reality.And for the record, I thought M. Night Shyamalan's acting turn in his own movie was rather good.Lady in the Water is not a perfect film, not even a masterpiece, but it does not deserve the scorn that has been heaped upon it. If you harbor a soft spot for fables and fantasies, do-gooders and **SPOILER ALERT** happy endings (LOTR anyone?) then take a chance on this lovely little film.",Lady in the Water

I was a wreck after King Kong and I'll never watch it again for that reason! However, Lady In The Water is not a sad movie. What made me cry was the fact that I was totally blown away by the quality of the story and the film-making itself. The characters were very well drawn, and even though the story was a touch confusing at times, it didn't seem to matter.There were times when I thought the movie was going to trip up over itself. I needn't have worried. This has been talked about as Shyamalan's movie without a twist. However, the story is full of small twists, and when it all comes together it's exhilarating.Whenever I sit down to watch Shyamalan's future movies, I'll go with the flow all the way because he is truly a master storyteller and filmmaker, and on this evidence, I trust him never to leave me feeling short-changed.Despite what you may have heard, try not to go to this movie with any preconceptions. Simply sit back and let the story be told.",Lady in the Water

I had three emotions for this movie, and not all the movies can make you feel this. I was scared and suddenly laughing and the crying. What a beautiful movie, and of course the music is just overwhelming. So if you haven't seen it, just run! Paul Giamatti is excellent, you want to believe in him, in his madness to find out how to help the Narf. The colors of the movie are also beautiful, and the secondary roles are so well found.

I was stunned to see such a low rating for this film amongst the ranks of movies that should have never been financed. This movie was thought provoking, elegant, frightening and funny. M wrote this originally as a bedtime story for his children. The genius that it takes to write, direct and act in all of his projects is monumental.Paul Giamatti was perfectly cast.

The acting by Paul Giamati and Bryce Dallas Howard was superb. If your aren't to busy listening to the ""Know it All"" critics, you should go see and enjoy this movie. I'm afraid it has now become a popular trend to bash M. Night's films. Once he was praised for his style, now everyone thinks they could make a better movie than his.

At a time when Hollywood seems to be out of original ideas, a theme mocked beautifully in Lady in the Water, Shyamalan gives us something original. I especially liked his treatment of the film critic; sweet revenge, no doubt, for the bashing of ""The Village.""If you liked ""The Village""and you liked ""Signs""you will probably enjoy ""Lady in the Water.""

The film is quite like a fairy tale itself, which I found to be very entertaining and held my interest throughout. The real strength of Lady in the Water lies in Paul Giamatti's and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances. Paul, who definitely deserves an Oscar at some point in his career, was superb in his role. He has no trouble performing highly emotional scenes or making you believe he actually has a studder. I always look foreword to Shyamalan's appearances which never disappoint. He has an expanded role in the film compared to previous one's. Finally, like other Shyamalan movies, Lady in the Water is very atmospheric.

The storyline itself may be that of a bedtime tale, but it echoes sentiments that no matter what your age, ring true.I often wonder why people, including critics, seem to always bash M. Night's movies. Then I began to realized, that maybe they just don't ""get"" them...sometimes people don't see the forest for the trees. This seems to be the case with M. Night's movies. People complained that the aliens in ""Signs"" weren't scary enough...when the movie had nothing to do with the alien invasion. The same people said the monsters in ""The Village"" weren't believable, when once again the movie had nothing to do with the monsters. I'm sure these same people are complaining that ""Lady in the Water"" was just a lame bedtime story brought to life on the big screen...once again missing out on the bigger picture.Another M.

649,NotCoolEnuff88,Great Movie...Despite What People Say,10,23 July 2006,"So Friday came around, and the reviews were posted. Mediocre, Shyamalan lost his touch, this is indeed the downfall of Shyamalan and his career. The village was a disaster, and so was this movie. So after hearing all of these reviews, I really considered not seeing this movie. I thought the Village was ""okay"", it wasn't as bad as people said it was, but it was a let down for me. So why should I bother to see another movie that's so terrible? I took the risk anyways, and I'm glad I did. This movie was amazing, its a great story with amazing actors. I must make this clear however, this movie in NO WAY is rational or believable, its literally a ""bed time story"", its pure fantasy. It's very different from all of Shyamalans other movies, and this is what surprised me the most. From a director thats so formulaic, how could he come up with something like this? I've seen all of his movies, and by far this is my favorite one. The story was just so heart felt, and interesting. It was beyond my expectations, and I can't understand for the life of me why so many people low-balled this movie. Heres the only reason I could come up with, as to why this movie was thrashed by critics/fans.M.Night has a certain fan base, mostly horror and mystery fans. All of his movies contain what we see as ""every day"" people who deal with ""super-natural"" events. Almost all of his movies contain twists, they deceive us. They have have the audience thinking its going to go this way..when it end ups being completely opposite of what we thought. This movie however, steps out of that formula. Since M Night has his own following, a lot of them probably were baffled, frustrated at the fact that this was a ""fantasy"" movie. Afterall...they were already let down by the Village, so why would he go and make a fantasy movie. It really is a shame that this movie isn't doing good at the box office. I wonder...if this movie would of been released under a fake directors name, if it would of done better. I seriously think it would of. Fans of fantasy, and just people in general, would of gone to see it. But instead, we get the Shyamalan fans, that have come to expect the usual from their favorite director.I recommend this movie to all ""fantasy"" fans, it truly is a great story. (It's not only for fantasy fans). Remember, its by no way logical or rational...its a bed time story, and if your content with seeing something like that, you'll like this movie. The only beef I have with the film, the camera angles were a little frustrating at first. The whole movie is filmed in a ""zoomed"" in fashion, especially in the beginning of the film. As the movie goes on, it goes away from that. This movie was a 5/5 for me, but thats because I thoroughly enjoyed it. But if I were to take in the account of some of the camera angles, and some of the minor stuff that was wrong with the film...4/5.Hopefully some of you will give this movie the chance it deserves.",Lady in the Water
650,rskaletz,"sigh, still a huge Shyamalan fan but this movie didn't help.",6,25 July 2006,"Let me start by saying, I so badly wanted this movie to be good.I loved Sixth Sense, I thought Unbreakable was just as genius, thoroughly enjoyed the Village, and thought Signs was pretty decent though a couple things could have been done differently. I think M. Night Shymalan is a very skilled director and a creative story teller...and is probably most known for the huge twists at the end of his films as he shows you everything that you missed that was right in front of you.I understand its not the ending that makes the film, but ""Lady in the Water""'s ending was a bit absurd. The giant grass dogs (creative and creepy creatures, in my opinion) are attacked by -and I kid you not- giant monkeys that look exactly like a cross between the alien in Signs and the 'creatures' from the Village. And their attack makes NO sense.Even keeping in the mindset that this is a bed time story and completely fantasy, the film still has a weak plot. ""Story"", the narf (which is the word Pinky from ""Pinky and the Brain"" would always say so I couldn't take it seriously), needs to come up from the water to tell a writer his future and importance in writing a book that will change mankind, but she can't go back into the water without Tatsuis (grass dogs) attacking her before the giant eagle comes because she is the queen narf. or something. So she needs the help of Cleavland (the groundskeeper with a secret past) who is either the guardian, healer, or guildsman, or symbol reader. The plot couldn't be saved even though Paul Giamatti was absolutely fantastic and, in fact most of the actors and actresses did a great job (though i prefer Shyamalan as a cameo rather than the major role he had), the camera angles and cinematography were so inventive and what you've come to expect from a Shymalan movie.In the end, its not that this is the worst film I have ever seen, or even that it is a terrible movie. The film is just disappointing and pretty much forgettable. The moral ""everyone has a purpose and everything has a reason"" has been done before in Signs, and actually basically every other Shymalan movie. I still love him, but he needs to stick to directing until he can write up a more original screen play for next time.",Lady in the Water
651,nataniaf,Strange but awesome,9,23 July 2006,"I'm not going to pretend that this movie was the best piece of art ever created. It had elements that could have been done better (the one that stands out in my mind is that the characters were not well-developed), but I found it an amazing fairy tale- it is a fun and entertaining story with layers of meaning you notice when discussing it later. Don't let the previews fool you- it is not a thriller with jumps and scares, it is a fantasy tale.I felt that this film was very personal to Shyamalan; he plays a major role in it and it seems that he almost wrote himself into the script. Some say that it was self-indulgent for this reason, but I think Shyamalan just meant to express himself and the clearest way to do so was to say the lines himself. Also, we all know that Shyamalan has been having some trouble with film critics, and in this movie he chooses a hilarious way to get revenge on them.

653,dushyantw,Some men listen...,8,21 July 2006,"After watching the movie, I imagine critics scurrying to their writing machines to rain severe criticisms on M Night's ""Lady in the water"". They, no doubt, will speak of the movie's predictability and how there is a complete lack of surprise endings or ghosts talking to kids. I only hope they have enough grey matter to recognize the pot shot taken against them in the movie! And as always, I am going to completely discard these reviews. I think M Night has done it again. The dexterity with which he takes up and eccentric topic and goes berserk on it, is simply amazing.Think of the movie as a modern age fairly tale. I could draw metaphoric interferences but I don't think the director would want me to. Instead, I wiped my slate clean as I always do before I see his movies, and enjoyed this magical story telling experience. And like always, there is a plethora of morals and conclusions that hit you as exit the talkies and head towards the car.Perhaps my only gripe is that this movie shares a similar theme with ""Signs"" (His best creation yet). But make no mistake, M Night guarantees you an alternative movie experience. A pure, unadulterated, storytelling under dimmed lights, like no other",Lady in the Water
654,kderpder,Lady in The Water,10,5 August 2006,"Some people will certainly not get this film. I am a fan of M. Knight Shyamalan and if you are too you will like this movie.Like many classic youthful films, this movie takes a gentle story and matures it with suspense, action, fantasy and mystery. With an ""Eastern"" fairytale as a basis for the plot I am reminded of movies from my youth such as Labyrinth and The Never Ending Story. This is summed up by a character in the movie ""I wanted to believe, to feel like a kid again"" (may not be exact wording). As this story is revealed you become enchanted and, as usual with M. Knight Shyamalan's work, I was totally immersed in the suspense of the film. This is a movie that would be great for a family night as it is hopeful and uplifting, but stick to the rating of PG-13 some scenes may be considered too scary for young children and the plot too mature.Some people have preconceived notions about movies when they see patterns in director's or writer's works. Leave those notions at home. See this with an open mind and you will be truly charmed and entertained. This film is a unique, beautifully told story and should be considered a classic.",Lady in the Water
655,IATSECamera,baby's on the half tip!,10,22 March 2007,"I really like all of M. Night's films. This was no exception. A very original, unique, and well-crafted tale. Granted, the story doesn't make a lot of 'sense', but it has its own internal logic. There's so much charm and playfulness on display that whatever shortcomings the film has are easy to ignore. The story unfolds a lot like a real bedtime story. Anyone who has kids will know what I mean. When the kids ask you to tell them a story, you make something up, filling in details and bringing in new ideas as you go. Bedtime stories are unedited, raw; sure there's loose ends and things that don't add up. But what makes a truly great bedtime story (and I'm talking about the kind you tell on the fly, improvising as you go) is that what counts is heart. This film has heart in spades. I love it. M. Night is slowly but surely building a body of work. In ten or twenty years, he'll be up there with Hitchcock. Mark my words.",Lady in the Water
656,cneiss,Textbook,7,4 August 2006,"I walked out of the theater thinking this was not on par with M. Night Shyamalan's other works. I was feeling disappointed by the thin story and transparent characters and I started talking about it with my wife. By the time we left the parking lot, I realized that we had not seen a movie so much as gone to a class on how to tell a story. All that was missing was an instructor standing on stage echoing what the film was already saying. The real kicker is the name of the narf: Story. It's really a strange, simplistic name until you take it in the context of the movie. M. Night Shyamalan remains one of the best story tellers of our time. As a film maker, I put him on my personal pedestal next to Peter Weir.",Lady in the Water

It hasn't deserved the shafting it's getting.Lady in the Water has a magical feel to it. It's a bedtime story, put on film. Like a fairy tale. There's good guys, bad guys, danger, and mystic. What's not to love? It's not like his other films, though I think each one has been kinda different anyway. Unbreakable, which I didn't like at all the first time I saw it, I actually enjoyed the second time through. There was something about the way in which he put the Willis character against the Jackson character. It was like.. watching a comic book. And while it wasn't the glorified sorta.. Superman/Batman sorta.. bright colours.. big powers.. that you get from lots of comics.. it was subtle, and watching it again, I actually thought really fascinating.Anyway.. Sixth Sense was another one that you almost enjoy more the second time through. You watch it, this time knowing the twist, and notice that Bruce Willis, after he gets shot, only ever talks to the Osmund character. You don't notice that the first time.And I just loved the Village. Flat out.I think what makes his films so enjoyable to me are the subtle things. Things you might not catch til the second time through. But I loved Lady in the Water, the first time through. Just as I did the Village. It was an awesome story. Sweet, engaging, well acted, and just a little surreal. But hey, if you have totally forgotten what it was like to be a kid and enjoy a story, then yea, you might not like it. :)",Lady in the Water
659,Donna-144,Psychologically Stimulating,10,26 July 2006,"I find that most that enjoyed ""Lady In The Water"" have an affinity for psychologically stimulating movies. The thought process throughout the movie goes deeper than what is displayed on the screen. Allow yourself to read more than what is projected and the lessons learned within its contents will amaze you. This is more than a fairy tale movieit compels one to think outside of the words and actions of the characters. Recall his other movies which took the audience by the hand and lead them directly to the irony and the fact that there was more to the story than what was being said and done. Apply that information to ""Lady In The Water"" and you'll 'get it'.",Lady in the Water

661,neilkale,Highly Original,7,22 July 2006,"If not for anything else, Shammy deserves credit for writing and directing a highly original film. In fact the whole film in my opinion is based upon originality. Throughout the film there is back and forth interaction between various narratives(The old Chinese women, the critic, and even the Lady in the Water) and those who are trying to put together the story(mainly Cleveland). Serving the theme of originality; the story never quite follows the narrative. There is always some detail from the narrative that doesn't quite fit, or which is interpreted in the wrong way. Shammy even goes as far as to add a scene where he ridicules the predictable events in most horror films( I'm pretty sure he himself is guilty of this in previous films). The film was very intelligent and the direction was superb as usual, but I felt there was something missing.",Lady in the Water

His films have all been amazing to me. The Village is actually my favorite movie ever. With that all said I was baffled at what I had seen after the movie ended. I sat there as my whole theater formed a mob and began to bash the film as the credits rolled. I honestly did not know what to say or do, so I just sat there. When I got home, my family asked me if it was good or not, I said I have no idea. This movie definitely had something special going on but that something special seemed to get lost. The movie just seemed empty. It was not full of all the wonderful things his other films were full of. I still suggest to go see this movie because as to everyone I have talked to, it sounds like some people thought it was very good. I for one think the film is very interesting and when it ends it still seems interesting to the full extent as did in the beginning of the film. That is a bad thing because none of the interest was fulfilled, it still seemed out in the open. In the end, I will label this film as the one that got away for Shyamalan and I hope everyone else will consider watching just to see how it affects them.6/10",Lady in the Water
663,nadidas99,"Went to the theater with an open mind, came out chastising myself for not taking drugs..",2,5 August 2006,"Let me first acknowledge that I am an M. Night Shymalan fan. I was a huge fan of The Sixth Sense, Signs and the movie that was torn to pieces on all levels, The Village. My thinking going into the theater was ""All of these negative reviews, these are the same people who wrote negatively about The Village, and I thought that was a killer movie."" However, my intuition told me that these people were right and my intuition once again didn't fail me. This movie is a catastrophic mess, more of a mess than I have ever seen in a movie. And the sad thing is that there are no ways to fix this thing. It is irreversible damage. I kept telling myself from the middle of the movie on ""Am I really seeing this?"" ""Am I in a dream?"" ""Maybe if I would've taken drugs then this movie would've been more appealing.I could waste my energy giving the 1,000 reasons why this movie was so sloppy, non sensible, over the top. However, one must find out for themselves. It seems that M. Night was trying to create a Mulholland Drive kind of plot, one that takes a bunch of twists and turns and which is ultimately left to the interpretation of the audience. That is the way I see it. However, there is no way to dechiper this mess. And all of those who say ""oh, it's only a bedtime story."" Well, I am a fan of such things..I love fantasy stories and bedtime stories as well and this is a BADDDD bedtime story. See at your own risk",Lady in the Water

This is not a horror movie, but a fantastical mythological mystery set in present day and time. It truly is a great story, well shot, and different from anything you would normally see in theaters. Don't go into it thinking it's a horror movie, because it's not, go see it for a really great and engaging story. Paul Giamatti turns in an award worthy performance, Bryce Dallas Howard is beautiful, and M. Night Shyamalan (besides being a great writer and director) is top 50 most Beautiful Men for sure.

Yes this is a 2015 review of a 2006? movie that I saw with my son in the theater in 2006. I just watched it for perhaps the 4th time over the years. I still enjoy this and I feel it has many hidden meanings and can impact people in different ways or even different ways the more you watch it. It brings up the disconnect of current humanity and that we are better than we think. Don't underrate this film since it's not as obvious as say SIGNS. It's a movie to really make you think out your own meaning and inspirations. Not every movie is meant to impress all with a carbon copy answer to it's meaning. I thinks that's the beauty of this film and has made it a sleeper. Watch it, take what you like and leave the rest. Don't over think it. It's an enjoyable film with excellent acting and production as all of M Knights movies tend to be.",Lady in the Water

But you had to pay me to sit there and watch.2.) Freddy Got Fingered, I only walked out because I was younger at the time and my friend's sister made us leave.Anywho, back to this movie.I was so tempted to walk out several times, but I just sat there and watch the trash that we were being fed. It wasn't clever or interesting one bit. The Cinema aspect was awful, you'd think some of these people never used a camera before.Basically, M Night is awful at telling stories. It didn't make any sense and was too vague.I don't see that we are ever going to see anything half decent from M Night ever again.I just don't know how to describe this movie, it was just plain awful. We barely even got to meet any of these characters, we weren't invited in. We were just thrown into this shitty storyline where characters automatically believe anything they are told. I can't really say much else......This is basically a series of thoughts that went through my mind when I was watching this movie.",Lady in the Water
667,bbieri99,almost a great movie,7,29 July 2006,"Some directors are known to be very good actors as well. M. Night Shyalaman should have learned a lesson from his brief, uninspired cameo in ""signs"". Instead, his character wavers and speaks in dialog that sounds alternately human and science fiction narrator. Unfortunately, his is not the only questionable acting in this movie. This sets the stage for a movie that is both cute and not exactly complete at the same time. Paul Giamatti did an excellent job, but that is as surprising as the sun coming up at daybreak. The story is very intriguing, although I am still left wondering why the things that police the ""laws"" are supposed to be very evil. Overall, I was slightly disappointed. This folk tale could have been so much more, and appeared to be heading in the right direction. I loved that it was enclosed in a small apartment complex. I give it a 7 because even though it is not a great movie, it would be fun to watch again.",Lady in the Water

I was not sure what type of movie I expected based on the trailer, but what I saw was nothing like what I thought I'd be seeing. The actual storyline was somewhat silly. The characters were by no means believable. I thought I liked Paul Giamatti, but his acting seems be the same as in the Cinderella Man. Bryce Dallas Howard is someone I cannot place, although she has been in a few big movies. She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, much less out of a swimming pool. I have grown really tired of stereotypical Asian butchering of English. My wife is Chinese. Her second language is English. She doesn't sound like the Young-Sook Choi character. For that matter, few to none of the people I met and taught over my three years in China sounded like the Choi character. Overall, I thought the acting was fairly bad. I should have waited for it to come out on video.",Lady in the Water
669,owenarnold,Whats wrong with all of you?,8,13 August 2006,"Normally I agree with 99.99% of IMDb average ratings but I could not be more detached from IMDb users when it comes to Shyamalan's Lady In The Water. I thought it was his second best film next to, of course, The Sixth Sense.Now from most of the reviews the focus has been on the fairytale story, mentioning the ""Ludicrous"" gnarfs, scrunts, etc. Yet this focus puzzles me. Like Unbreakable, a Shyamalan spin on the comic book genre, this is M. Night's spin on the fairytale genre, where humans try to make sense of their mundane lives through the enchanting mysteries of the universe that surround them, and this film manages to capture the beauty and scariness (seriously, there are some scary moments) of life, with this film definitely being Shyamalsn's funniest film.In other words its not just about the fairytale, in fact, the fairytale element is not even secondary in central themes, the film is about human civilisation and its inability to see beauty in the ordinary, becoming so immersed in conventions and normality that we have lost touch with the magic that is communication. A theme Shyamalan dealt with better in The Sixth Sense.The film is about all these different people living in this apartment block, from Chinese to Porto Rican, and they are all linked with one common theme, they are drawn by an unknown force to ""be"" there. Every character is connected, and this is confirmed when the protagonist, Clevelend (Paul Giamatti) discovers a lady in the water and realising she is not of this world, he attempts to return her to the Blue World, but ""something"" wants her killed.Strange occurrences happen, a wolf like creature appears, people start to realise their purpose in life, Clevelend starts to stand up to his demons from a past family tragedy.All this builds up to a nail biting ending that still proves Shyamalan has what it takes to be not just an Auteur, but also a Director who can produce emotionally charged films equivalent to Spielberg.Overall I recommend this film highly.",Lady in the Water
670,hdvdeo,Prophecy or subtle joke,8,6 December 2006,"Nice movie. Just when watching do not forget it is kind of fairytale mixed with reality like sometimes we have in our dreams. By the way it is not the first M. Night's movie which mixes fictional and real worlds. Somebody sees prophecy in this movie in place where narf tells about a boy destined to become the president of the United States. But for me it's more like a joke. Actually narf says that the contents of the book will be the 'seeds of the minds of this boy which will become the president'. Ironically the book called ""The Cookbook"" (although the book is not about the cooking). Isn't that the critics of current president of United States?Definitely must see, but not in cinema. DVD only with appropriate mood.Would I want to watch this movie one more time? The answer is: YES.",Lady in the Water
671,martinidry,This director has lost it,1,23 December 2006,"This movie is nothing if not incredibly boring. It seems as if was written and directed by a high school student. I think that the director simply had one load in him and he shot it with The Sixth Sense. After that, he's created a series of movies that require his fans to essentially be apologists for his later work because they were so moved by his first work. The acting is stiff and even juvenile. This is no fault of the actors because even the most talented cast could not have made anything out of this inane script. Beyond being boring, it's so incredibly self-conscious and self-aware--always explaining itself and its plot through clumsy ""plot explanation"" lines that are thrown in from time to time. I cannot imagine what the reaction of the studio execs was the first time they saw what they had spent their money on. And the director's role in it is so distracting. If he is even 1/10th the egomaniac and narcissist that the film portrays him as I'd be concerned for him. His character's sense of universal self-importance may reflect his own view of himself that his status as a short-term Hollywood golden boy has generated. If that is true, he must disabuse himself of this notion immediately.",Lady in the Water
672,outoffocus04101,Great departure from the crap that Hollywood is putting out.,9,14 August 2006,"I went to see this movie without any expectations. I didn't even know the story. All I knew was that this was more of a fantasy film.I was quickly swallowed by the characters and realized this was going to be a character and story driven movie. Hmmm, there's a concept. Yes, it had its share of special effects but didn't rely on them to keep the film going. It didn't even rely on editing to keep the audience engaged. And if you think about it, when was the last time you saw a movie without the tricks of eye-jittering editing? I'll admit that the long, static shots of many of the sequences made me feel odd, mainly because I'm not used to them anymore and because it helped build the tension in the story.I'm one of those people that always cheers for the villains of a film. But this is the first movie in a long time where I sided with the protagonists. (I think the last one was To Kill a Mockingbird.) No one had to fight with tanks, guns, missiles, etc for the great American dream or to prove that this was the only way you can feel safe in the world. At its core, this was a story of HOPE. In a crappy world where we're all killing each other, Lady In The Water is a welcome distraction from the mindless, mass-produced slop that Hollywood is forcing down our throats.Many people are slamming it and I say they should be criticizing themselves. One, for being too lazy to watch a film where you need to listen to the story unfold. And, two, for being stupid and not getting the bigger picture.And to the 13 year old girls sitting in front of me at the movie theater that said at the end of the movie, ""This sucked. It was so boring. I don't get it. That's it."" I say to you, ""Yes, that it. For you. You'll never get anything out of life because you're already another monkey on the assembly line of conformity."" And to those who don't agree with me, and I know there are a lot, I say go see the movie again with an open mind and let the story fill your head. Let something actually take up space in there.",Lady in the Water
673,laurence-simner,Couldn't have been more empty,3,28 July 2006,"I have always placed a high regard on M. Night's work and his ability to tell a story without allowing too much information at one time so as to keep us guessing. I have been a big fan of his films (save 'Signs' which I found to have a weak ending that negated the rest of the film). I have always supported his visual style and his ability to surprise and to remind us that good storytelling takes us to another time or place and keep us there long after the story ends.With 'Lady in the Water' I have found that my faith has been shaken. Instead of writing a nicely illustrated children's book, it seems that Night chose to use the financial backing of a major studio (not his first choice in studios mind you), as well as his pull in Hollywood to gain the assistance of some A-list stars, in order to put on to celluloid a fairy tale that until now was reserved exclusively for his children. A fairy tale, the purpose of which was to bond father to child and ultimately to induce sleep.Anyone beyond Night's children may have a difficult time bonding with him through this story, but might have an easier time finding sleep when it is all over.I am not implying that the film is dull, or even slow, as the pacing is generally good and the acting is above average in most cases. The problems lie in the absence of value in any of the characters, and more importantly the complete lack of a satisfying pay off when all is said and done.Anyone who watches this film with any base of knowledge in character development, and a basic sense of which characters will play an important role in later acts, will undoubtedly guess the role that each character will take long before they do. The result is a film that is mearly a confirmation of what the audience has already figured out for themselves. As such, the 110 minutes spent watching this film leave the viewer feeling completely empty, without having been given anything to fill the space normally reserved for the excitement of a revealing moment or the thrill of witnessing new visual magic or a piece of human nature previously unknown.In the end, when the story has completely unfolded, and the final act is playing out, if the storyteller has (on more than one occasion early on in this film) revealed what the happy outcome will be, it has to be expected that when it does come to pass, there will be little surprise or revelry in the audience. Likewise, without giving the audience any post-climax follow up, insight or even a glimpse into why this ending will benefit any of the characters in the long run, there will be little there to benefit the audience in the long run either.I wanted to like this film, despite the reviews, but as I watched the end credits start to roll, all I could do was turn to my friend sitting next to me and ask, ""when is the movie going to start?"" and in a few days, I won't even remember that I watched this film at all.",Lady in the Water
674,americanme81,Piece of absolute tripe.,1,20 August 2006,"This is easily one of the bottom 3 movies I have seen in my life. To be frank, I have never liked any of Mr. Shyamalan's movies, with the exception of Unbreakable, which I still found only entertaining at best. I was expecting some kind of fantasy story with some predictable twist that made it all seem real at the end, but I couldn't believe it when he had made a movie worse than even that. I guess it's what I get when I am so bored I lower myself to watching something like this. I wanted to ask for my money back, but the only relief was that I had gotten to see this for free, thanks to free passes I had gotten. I am honestly surprised to see some good comments for this film on this site. I think the fact that this movie causes some kind of emotion is no sign of this director's genius, as I am usually angered when I waste my time and energy with a crappy movie. As for the acting, easily the worst I have seen in a year. I mean, I honestly believe someone like DJ Qualls(Road Trip, The New Guy) is a better actor than any of the actors in a movie and I already had him pegged as the worst. I can't believe I had some actual respect for Paul Giamatti before this movie. I now put him in the lowest echelon of actors. And the fact that he just recycles some ""loser"" character in every movie he does makes me sickened. As far as the Asian girl everyone finds entertaining, I thought she was annoying and not only that, but I was outraged as she was portrayed as an ugly stereotype. The worst thing of all was that Mr. Shyamalan would put himself into such a big part of the movie, and as the savior of the world. He really has some ego and a whole lot of audacity. Watching this movie, it was hard not to laugh out loud at the absurdity of the whole thing, as many people were doing. There was a child in the audience making loud comments during the whole thing and normally I would be enraged, but he was about the only entertaining part of the whole shebang. I think that the fact that people are reading so much into this movie and trying to find some brilliance in it is a sad statement about our society today. People will try to find some false ""art"" in any piece of garbage they can find. As one character in the movie says, ""Originality is dead."" This movie proves that. I sincerely hope Mr. Shyamalan will never be allowed to make another movie again.",Lady in the Water
675,hilroy2005,"I forgive, but I won't forget...",5,26 July 2006,"Let me start by saying that I am possibly the biggest fan of M's movies. Unbreakable, Sixth Sense and Signs are three of my all time favorite movies. A lot of people gave the village a lot of flack and although it was not his best work and was fairly predictable I still enjoyed it very much as well. Sadly the same can not be said for LITW. This movie was just plain bad. I can't even see how M made this B rate movie. I was madly excited to see this and took a date with me. Without a word of a lie my date fell asleep about 5 minutes into the movie because it was so boring. A loud noise awoke her eventually and shortly there after it was a battle for her to remain awake... she did fall asleep 3 or 4 more times even tho she denied it. I on the other hand was bored as well with the film but was waiting....waiting for what I knew would be the amazing twist that makes watching the boring stuff so worthwhile. Then nothing, absolutely nothing happened that I was not fully aware was going to happen already. This is not the best review of a movie, but thats because there was nothing in the movie worth reviewing, it was just plain bad as I said earlier. I sincerely wish M hadn't made this, its tarnished his whole career. Yet I will forgive him because he has made me shocked, terrified and awe stricken with his other films.

I thought the cinematography was beautiful (the predominate colors being very cool and soothing, and of course Shyamalan's trademark red as a contrast). The last shot was beautiful, too. CONS: It was commented to me that the residents in the apartment complex seemed all-too-willing to automatically believe the situation at hand, but I think that that was Shyamalan's point. To make it seem that humans haven't succumbed to all that is wicked, and that there might just be some hope, some will to believe, left in us.I say, take this movie for what it is.

It's so good to find a movie with such original story! The story is full of fun, creativity, some good thoughts, charismatic characters and a lovable ambition to bring fantasy to a real world by ordinary stuffs such as cereal boxes (you'll get it) These are ingredients to make you feel good and ready to sleep and have nice dreams. Well that's supposed to be for children! People who didn't like the plot were just expecting something that was never promised. It's not supposed to be horror! (You wouldn't tell a bed time story that would make the listener stay all night awake with fear!) Nevertheless, the creatures are still scary and original (once again revealing that aspiration of bringing fantasy close to what's as ordinary as grass)! Everything that happens in this movie has a purpose! You feel like every scene, every character, every line is worth your time, even those you didn't get at first. So very well directed, so very well done!!! One of those that make you leave the theater with a silly smile on your face, but that just feels good, right? ;) Shyamalan created a story that we'd all love to hear before going to bed if you think you're too old for that, try telling the story to someone younger; it feels as good as hearing it! ;)PS: (For the haters and the ones that want to understand why this movie is so underrated)First of all, talking about the Shyamalan Vs. Critics ""fight"" is not talking about the movie! So, you may question the way Shyamalan defend himself, but you can't say the story isn't funny and that you wouldn't like it if you didn't know what the ""fight"" was all about, if you only looked at THE MOVIE. Some of the reproofs you find in the hating reviews are just misunderstood. And I'm not talking about subjective matters (such as liking or not the fact that cereal boxes are important, the director having a big role (SO WHAT? Sorry, I couldn't help that), etc). I'll give you just 2 examples and you'll get my point: 1. Someone considered stupid the crying of the narf because she can see the future and should know everything will go well. You may think like that only if you forget something very important she said she can only see some parts of the future! That changes all your thinking, doesn't it? If there's doubt, there are reasons to feel insecure! 2. All those complaining about the fact that there's no characters questioning ""reality"", also forget something important. It is said that all those somehow connected to the apartment are there for a reason, even though they don't know it. They don't question because they are the ones that wouldn't do it. That's why they were ""chosen"" and destiny led'em there.So don't go on this hating bandwagon just because it's fun and gives you smart status. No! You'll give the impression of being distracted while watching the movie.",Lady in the Water
679,eengner,"Deeply entertaining, original story telling",10,25 January 2018,"You should know, and thoroughly accept, that this is a presentation of an original children's bedtime story, and a GREAT story it is. This is an example of story telling which involves many characters, each with a specific and cryptic role to fulfill, and the more you understand the background on each character, the more enjoyable it is. The story is unpredictable and keeps you guessing - and guessing wrong, while the characters each represent some nuance of society. I must mention, that Paul Giamatti (Cleveland Heep) plays, perhaps, the most believable character EVER. He is a broken-broken, lost, lonely, shell of a once happy man and I believe every second of his performance, and it's never over-acted. His performance is brilliant.
Here are brief statements about how it ""made me feel"": I stayed captivated by the story and where it was leading (great original story telling). I was memorized by Cleveland Heep and his state of mind (his character is relatable to me). It made me laugh out loud at times, and made my heart race at others and sometimes it made me feel silly. I am sure I smiled and leaned forward for the entire movie. It made me hopeful and uplifted my spirit. After the movie, I knew I had been on a great adventure, through story telling - and that's the reason I watch movies. In my opinion, it's one of M. Night Shyamalan's best stories yet. Congratulations Sir, I get it... even if the populous criticized it too much.",Lady in the Water
680,pillagepeople,Suspension of disbelief is required.,9,22 July 2006,"While many of the critical responses to this film have been negative, those reviewers seem to have spent most of the film trying to make sense of why residents of the Cove (where Giamatti is the superintendent) would go along with the film's unbelievable plot. I find the fact that reviewers expected this film to be somehow realistic or believable even more mystifying than the completely fantastic plot of the film itself.If you can suspend your disbelief for a couple of hours, and allow yourself to become caught up in the film's wild tale, I believe you will enjoy it. I am a programmer at an art-house cinema, a Pauline Kael fan, and an all-around film snob, and I loved it.Some of the critics' hang-ups not only mystify me, they upset me. Why is everyone up-in-arms that the apartment complex is ethnically diverse? Where film critics live, everyone may be the same color, but in the low-to-middle income neighborhood where I live, every other household has a different cultural background. In the five professional reviews of this film I read, every one chided the film for including this melting-pot cast. I thought the casting was great. Freddy Rodriguez is especially funny as an exercise freak with some strange habits.The central lesson of the film - that people never believe that they are capable of being anything great - is very ham-fisted. Point taken. And the plot's mythical elements and E.T.-like characters are unbelievable. But whoever said that film has to be believable? I loved this movie for being what it plainly intended to be - a fable. No more and no less. In one review, the film was criticized for being like a horror film as directed by Jim Jarmusch. I would praise it for exactly the same reason.",Lady in the Water

By the end of their first sentence, you will know how deep they go. You may also see the same about yourself.Between the time the credits began to roll, and when I walked into my back door about ten minutes later, I felt as if a universe of meaning had dawned on me. The really beautiful thing about this movie is how, afterward, you realize that something wonderful and meaningful has just unfolded before your eyes, and you didn't see it coming. Like others of M. Night's movies, this one has to do with finding one's purpose in life. I believe the crux, though, is that in this movie, everyone finds their purpose through... are you ready?... through ""Story."" I happen to agree. I believe stories are the primary way of communicating truth and purpose.To me, Lady in the Water is simply a storyteller saying to his audience, ""This is why I do what I do. Maybe you can find your purpose through it.""So, as you walk out, when the guy behind you says to his girlfriend, ""Well, that just sucked!"", you can probably guess that for him, probably the best movie of the year so far is Fast and Furious 3: Tokyo Drift. But, when you leave, and you find yourself feeling the movie unfold inside you... if Story has caused an awakening, and you feel the pins and needles... consider yourself deeper than the average moviegoer.

And no wonder. Myself, I was mostly moaning, wishing I had sat closer to an aisle or an exit. And I actually went into this film expecting to like it......The script is incomprehensible and illogical. I realize this is ""meant"" to be a fable, but it's mostly the director --- who mugs his way through a key role in his own film, getting his own good side most of the time --- who's really out to lecture us. In passing, we get a middle class housing project in ""Philadelphia"" which seems to be situated with suburbs on one side and a national wildlife preserve on the other. We meet a mythical beast which looks like a crocadoggy, which appears at a building wide party but no one notices. Paul Giammati, who wears glasses in the film, manages what seems to be a hyper-athletic underwater dive without glasses or goggles that would have taxed an experience scuba diver. A film critic gets torn apart by the monster in a building corridor but no one notices (is M-Night suggesting something here?) and there is a really nasty racial sterotype of an Asian girl, a ""college student,"" who speaks we-all-sound-same funny-rice-girl English. Uh, why funny accent for Asian girl, Mr. Filmmaker, when Indian-American film director-actor talk so good? Funny accent no essential to plot, so why include, hey?

Night allows his inquisitive viewers to try to and put the puzzles together before their truths are revealed. If you enjoy magical realism, or folklore very much this film is for you. If you expected a mundane and oversimplified horror flick than this film is not for you. Lady In The Water in my opinion is for everyone, but you if don't have an open mind or you cannot at least enjoy a bit of a more pragmatic approach to the supernatural world you are wasting your money.

I entered the cinema very doubtful that I would enjoy such a piece, but emerged inspired. Sure, it WAS just a movie, but it's one that asks whether we might rise to greater things, if this world did contain an element of the magic we once believed in when we were young. Spielberg asked this in Hook and ET. Shyamalan does no more than to ask it here. For me, this was first of all a film about compassion, hope and courage. And while it may have been woven into a contemporary fantasy, isn't that the case with all fairy tales? Definitely one I'll buy on DVD when it comes out, so I can visit that 'what if' world Shyamalan is so good at creating.",Lady in the Water
685,Maestro232,Well crafted adult fairy tale,8,28 July 2006,"There are many things I enjoyed about this movie:1. It is an expertly crafted and implemented fairy-tale that is both far enough out of and close enough into our world to make relevant comments and observations on humanity in both an entertaining and encouraging fashion.2. It is genuinely funny! Because the overall ambiance is tense, the humorous moments are sweet relief, yet never forced. The several characters have such unique characteristics that their natural behavior is simply laugh-out-loud delightful.3. The balance of drama, humor, fright, philosophy, and mystery are so well-balanced that it is like a full course meal when your done. Some go to movies just for desert, just for a main course, or perhaps just for an appetizer. This was all three of them.4. The acting was spot-on. Giamatti really drives this thing home. He plays a complex character who needs only sparse development for us to know him fully. Other's were perfect for their smaller roles.The critics have proved once again that they are unable to just watch and enjoy a movie. They let all of the emotional baggage attached to the project spoil their ability to see the film for what it is. I don't care what they say, Shayamalan's acting is comfortable and confident.* MINOR, MINOR SPOILER * The role of Shayamalan as one who has to accomplish something very important to effect world change is perceived by all the critics to be the ultimate act of hubris by Shayamalan, but it's really not a big deal. I think they are just jealous or something. He really is not the main point of this movie. He is just, in some sense, explanation for why the Narf is there. The movie isn't finally about why she's there, though. It's about how people work together to try and get her back. * END MINOR, MINOR SPOILER *Go see it. If you want to know if your kids will be too scared, consider it to be slightly less tense than the Village. That is a fair barometer.",Lady in the Water

I was entertained for about half of the movie, but soon after realized what a ridiculous piece of self indulgent crap this once loved director/writer had made. I felt as though my brain was being raped, while Shyamalan sat in the back of the theatre getting some kind of sick, snuff-film-like pleasure out of my horrible pain. I totally understand wanting to view this movie to see what the horrible reviews are all about, but I strongly suggest to just find something else to occupy your mind, and wait for the DVD (because I'm sure that will be packed with special features, most of which will be Shyamalan explaining the unknown genius of this ""masterpiece"" we have been so graced to have in our presence.) AND, as a matter of fact, I will be the first one in line to view the DVD extras to hear ""His Excellency"" explain the (ridiculously unimaginable) six or seven scenes where the mic seems to find itself at the top of the screen and then tries to stealthily sneak itself out as if it were never there.",Lady in the Water

What I don't recall from the TV trailer, was seeing a rating. Imagine my disappointment, when we sat down to watch a 'PG'. Not only was it not scary, chilling or by any means as exciting as the trailer leads you to believe; but this wasn't even suitable for kids! Watched by any of those movie buffs who pick up mistakes and changes, you will find the lead character's hair changes colour (unintentionally) in a couple of scenes, which was the most excitement we had as my boyfriend and I, as well as other audience members, giggled away at the new appearance of what was supposed to be the same person, from scene to scene.

Night Shamalan movie I decided to go see it.The opening to the movie made me very concerned, little cartoons, and a story that just seemed like a bunch of nonsense. But oh how I was wrong. As the movie went along I started to fall in love with the characters. Each one with there own purpose to the story. A great ensemble cast including Paul Giamatti, Bryce Dallas Howard, and the director himself M. Night Shamalan.This is though a movie that you can only love it or hate it. But I do recommend everyone see it. To me, M. Night Shamalan has redeemed himself from the mediocre ""The Village"", and you can even compare it to The Sixth Sense.Three words.

Night: I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" adored it...saw ""Signs"" didn't hate it...then I saw ""The Village"" and despised it. I went into the theaters each time expecting a thriller, because that's how his movies are sold in trailers, and was each time utterly disappointed.I went a couple of years thinking that this directer was a one hit wonder, then I heard that ""Lady in the Water"" was coming out (again being sold to audiences as a ""thriller""). I wasn't going to even go, when a friend of mine forced me to watch ""The Village"" again, this time not as a thriller, but as a drama. I watched the entire thing, and in the end I was in love with the story. I realized that M. Night isn't trying to be Hitchcock (despite his cameos in his films and his use of suspense). I think his movies have such a tenderness to them, such profound simplicity. When you try to analyze his films, you're missing the point. His work is about throwing all the rules out the window. He trying something different, and that never goes down without a hitch. People resist that kind of daring. I DID go to see lady in the water, not as a thriller, but as a fairy tale. When you watch it like a fairy tale, you don't NEED to understand every single detail, because you suspend your disbelief and are swept into the emotion of the story. I recommend this film to those of you who can watch with an open mind, suspending judgement until after you've given your heart a chance to connect with the story.",Lady in the Water

It is a refreshing reminder that someone still believes in the art of story-telling being the principle of a movie. Watching Lady in the Water, it almost seemed as if Shyamalan was dumbing down his approach, as to keep the audience in the loop. But moviegoers still filed out of the theater prematurely dissatisfied with the slow-paced story. It is without a doubt that Shyamalan is a clever writer/director; from the odes to his past movies, to the cinematography. what I found most intriguing was how Shyamalan played the roll of VIC RAN as the writer chosen to write something significant enough to change the thinking of mankind. I just thought it was pretty ballsy for M. Knight to play that roll, slightly indicating that he understood this story he was writing would not be well perceived by today's audience, but someday could be the seed to some mid-western child who will watch this movie and understand it's message.

Why this deranged man (M Night Shamalama) didn't follow his family's advice and become a doctor would be a far better topic of tragic discussion than spending another nano-second trying to analyze why he has so much contempt for his audience. What is evident to me is the fact that the inflated audience scores on IMDb and metacritic for this waste of celluloid could only be the result of M Night sitting in front of his lap top, frothing from the mouth, while repeatedly registering under different names to give his own movie one score of 10 after another.

I have liked every movie he has done (except this one), and I think they all have their own merits. On top of this, he is one of the better technical and original directors of our time. His pacing is usually magnificent, as well as his shot framing and selection. However, Shyamalan's writing has never been superb. His dialogue is contrived, verbose and sophomoric. While his plots are mediocre at best, and usually use a gimmicky ending to save them. His themes are shallow, and lend themselves to the worst type of pretentiousness. This is to say, Shyamalan could be a great director, if he would use someone else's script.Lady in the Water: The technical directing extolled above, is no where to be found in this movie. Sadly, what I enjoy most in Shyamalan's work seems to be purposefully removed. The plot is more than typically bad for Shyamalan's writing, and the dialogue is ten times worse than any of his other films. The dialogue is so terrible, that even great performances by Giamatti and Howard cannot save it. Further, the movie takes absurd jabs at critics, and one cannot help but think the audience itself. It has an ""I don't care, you still got suckered into buying a ticket"" attitude, which I found maddening.

It tries to be a comedy, a horror, and a drama, but fails to deliver one good laugh, one good scare (a few cheap ""boo-jumps"" don't count), or one good tear.The basic premise is a good one: mythological characters invading the real world. The problem is: Shymalan did not borrow from a strong, existing mythology to create the story, instead he invented his own very weak folk tale as the device.

The music is amazing and while the end contains no twist it is very satisfying.Night tells the story and executes it very well and in a way you've probably never seen before. As the story progresses, the characters must learn their own roles and the ending is layed out much before it is ever revealed.

Yes the film is a fantasy, and no there is no twist, but the lack of A: an ending, and B: much of a resolution, kills the mood and leaves the audience thinking, how was that supposed to work? From the point of view of a guy who is a fan of Shyamalan's work, and consider's himself to be someone with an open mind, this movie was just plain underdeveloped. The movie started just as any other Shyamalan film, dull, slow-paced, and boring, yet it never seemed to pick up as his films tend to do.I understood all of the themes, and I got the message that he was trying to send forth, but the movie otherwise was a mediocre display of Shyamalan's infinite talent.",Lady in the Water
708,roy_m_white,Fascinating Charming Enthralling !,10,8 September 2006,"An unusual, intelligent gem of a film. Excellent performances by all the cast... especially funny scene from the ""Party man"" (Film Critic). I may be an idealistic romantic but I think if people have patience to watch and give it a chance they'll find something beautiful in this film. It is beautifully and cleverly shot, composed well and has a quirky energy. The central character goes through a trial and I think that the films message is one of hope and how we each can be true to ourselves and selflessly contribute. A real message of hope laid upon the innocence of childhood fairy tales which leads to a simple tale that we can all strive for truth, honesty, struggle, joy and selflessness.

709,strikefire83,"Pedantic, contrived exercise in tedium and boredom",1,24 July 2006,"As someone who loved The Sixth Sense and Signs, and who liked Unbreakable, I've got to say it's disappointing where Shyamalan seems to be taking his movies.Lady in the Water has none of those attributes. For one thing, it's boring, something none of his other movies were. Here we have a sloppily unstructured mess of a film filled to the brim with incoherent bedtime story ""mythology"" that changes from one minute to the next, so even if you try and follow the world of the story your efforts will only be met with frustration. The film's flaws are many, and as others have and will point them out with much more dexterity than me, I'll simply list the films greatest foibles.1) Shyamalan casts HIMSELF as a John the Baptist character who will inspire ""a great leader who will change everything"" from a hastily constructed presumable political treatise entitled, of all things, The Cookbook. Give me a break! As someone who styles himself as a modern day Hitchcock, M. Night should take a page from that man's book and continue to play cameo roles, not central ones.2) His supporting characters are a mish-mash of ethnic and cultural stereotypes. The ""Asian"" student who attends university but cannot string together a coherent English sentence. Of course the otherworldly ""mythology"" is the remnant of some vaguely Eastern legend based on truth. The old Jewish woman is tackily dressed and her husband is always in the bathroom. Please.3) The film/movie critic is one of the ONLY interesting and rounded characters, and Shyamalan kills him off as he rattles off trite contrivances. This character's appearance seems like a defensive self-conscious way to preempt the critical panning of this film. When a writer forces one of his characters to go on the defensive in dialogue, you know something has got to be wrong with a movie.4) Shyamalan continues his now hackneyed convention of having a protagonist who's suffered tremendous loss in the form of familial death. Enough Already. Paul G is a great actor, the unnecessary back story about a dead family and a lost medical practice trite and out of place.The list goes on and on, but suffice it to say this movie is a waste of celluloid, or hard drive space if you'd prefer. Avoid like plague.",Lady in the Water
710,chrome_face,Forget the lady in the water...Save M.Night! His films are drowning!!,2,29 July 2006,"Now right off, I want to apologize to anybody who liked Lady in the Water, in advance...Actually, I'd like to apologize to your senses of both sight and sound, for you putting them through that beast of a crap fest. I don't want to hear how I can't bare to hear that some people like this film. That's fine. That's obviously their right. But I sat in boredom, for 2 hours, listening to and trying to decipher, what appeared to be M. Night's script trying to suffocate me with it's semantics. This makes 2 movies in a row from M. Night that I thought was horrible. "" The Village "", being the first movie. I'm not sure, but I think for the next few projects, M. Night needs to just translate other people's writing onto the big screen, rather than trying to create a suspenseful masterpiece himself.The central theme of Lady in the Water was supposed to be "" finding a purpose for yourself "" and "" to not be afraid ""...or that's what I got out of the anti-convoluted plot and sociology professor style dialogue. The first hour of this film, I kind of just sat and waited for something to happen, while just trying to enjoy the fact that Paul G. was playing the main character of the film. But, the last hour of the movie I spent essentially shaking my head and snickering at the ridiculous dialogue and lack of interesting sequences. I wanted something interesting to happen at the end of this movie...I really did. Because it would've warranted my sitting through the first hour and 45 minutes of it. ((SPOILER ALERT!!))Instead, I comically stated to myself "" SPECIAL EFFECTS TO THE RESCUE!! "" as the computer generated eagle came flying down to take the queen Nurf to her sanctuary..or whatever.This was the worst movie I've seen all year long. M. Night is an extremely talented director, but he's got a really crappy film batting average right about now. I hope he can regain his past genius soon. Either that, or just stop making films like "" The Village "" and "" Lady in the Water "". Gasoline in California is pretty expensive, and instead of sitting through this film, I could've utilized my 7 dollars on a couple of tablespoons worth of regular unleaded.",Lady in the Water

I'm tired of seeing the same movie over and over and over again. Do people really want to know what happens before it happens? I sure don't. It gets boring. This movie is one of the BEST movies I have seen in a while. It is beautifully creative. I went with a couple of people to see this movie and I loved every moment of it. Just because the story/plot is something different doesn't mean it's a bad movie. M. Night Shyamalan has imagination and that is what it takes to make movies; IMAGINATION!

That's what movies and stories are about, after all. The child inside me loved the fantastical elements of the story, and the adult me enjoyed the thrill and the suspense of what was going to happen.If J.R.R. Tolkien can use mythical creatures to tell his tale, then M. Knight Shyamalan can do the same. The plot and themes are good enough to allow for that. There's meaning to this story. There's a message.I guess there are two types of people who go see the movie. There are those who come out of the theater wanting to laugh because the mythology is so unbelievable (one of my friends), and there are the ones who come out smiling (me) or crying (my other friend) because it spoke to them.

Was it the lady, because she was safer around water, or was it the dog-creature to further his camouflage? 2) What exactly was up with the 3 monkeys? The old woman (through translation) basically said they were 'so evil', and that they helped to enforce the 'rules'. Well, where were they throughout the movie when the dog broke the rules and tried to attack? And, if they are pure evil, then why are they not attacking the lady? 3) The guy that ended up being the 'guardian', the one that only worked out on half his body. Once they revealed that he was the 'guardian' I thought for sure that his 'strong half' would be used to help kill the dog or something, but it wasn't.

What I saw was a script that must have been put together in less than a day. Dialogue was amazingly bad and the characters were cast as unimaginative typical stereotypes.As a ex-M. Night Shyamalan fan, I am truly disappointed. I will even go as far as to say I will probably never watch another M. Night Shyamalan film again. I'm embarrassed not only for him, but for his family and friends as well. I didn't leave my apartment for 2 days because I was so disgraced and embarrassed for not turning off this movie 10 minutes in.Pray for M.

717,mkeys10421,Another Good One,9,25 July 2006,"M. Knight continues his tradition of making a movie that inspires and keeps you guessing till the end. The story, similarly in Shattered and Signs, leaves you with that belief that we all have a purpose in the world, that we are all connected and part of a bigger picture. I'm sure I wasn't the only one with a little lump in my throat when that was revealed. He upholds his unique ability to weave story into reality and to make you wonder if maybe we all have blinders on. Additionally, there were some interesting and colorful characters in Lady, with a bit of comedy at times. While I will always love how M.Knight's movies push perspective and one's beliefs, it makes the story more endearing to be able to laugh along side being serious and on-the-edge-of-your-seat. This is the first time there is a lengthy appearance by the director, and as my beloved beau commented, ""he seems quite comfortable in front of the camera.""

Behind a lighthearted tale of a girl trying to go home is a deep, thought provoking secret, and it makes for a truly unforgettable movie. At times, the viewer will feel completely and utterly lost - at other times, the viewer will be entranced. Eerie, heartwarming, and amazing all at once. M. Night Shyamalan is a genius in every sense of the word, and this is probably his best work yet. There are a few scares and jumps, but most of the movie is very calm, serene, and mellow. That is not, of course, to say that it's boring. Not in the least. The movie grabs you at the very beginning and draws you in, keeps you keen on every tiny detail, wraps you up in everything the plot has to offer. Then it throws you off, turns you around, kicks you about, steps on your foot, and then pulls you back in and ties everything together not a moment too soon. It is brilliant. It is enchanting.

719,lockstockmike,Garbage?,3,26 July 2006,"Okay. I, unlike a lot of people on this board, went into the theater with a very open mind. I have seen all of M. Night's films and, to be honest, expected a great movie. I mean afterall, Signs and The Village did not even compare to The Sixth Sense in terms of creativity and execution. Both were incredibly predictable and unoriginal, in my opinion. So I was expecting M. Night to redeem himself. I went to a 10 PM showing and there were no annoying kids, just people eager to see a good flick.I could not have been more disappointed. No offense to the director, writer, producer, etc., but I could have come up with a better movie idea whilst sitting on my toilet. There were so many things that detracted from the movie. I understand the context of the film, and that it is being billed as an ""adult fairy tale,"" but to have a bunch of guild members randomly being compiled, all of which do not question the scenario whatsoever, makes for a reeeeally awkward movie.When Giamatti's character goes to Balaban's character (the new tenant) to ask about ""plot advice"" I almost wanted to shoot myself. Like some random movie critic would impart his knowledge to his landlord upon request, while just happening to answer all of his questions exactly, pointing to the traits of every character involved. The idea is trite and entirely weathered. The fact that a child could interpret what needed to happen by staring at a cabinet of cereal boxes is NOT creative - it is laughable.I capitulate that there were some quality aspects to the film. It is unique in the fact that it isn't about some 20-some-year-old trying to make it in the _____ industry, but it was poorly executed and trite. The ending was anti-climactic and predictable. After the movie, the entire audience had a half-smirk on their faces. ""Did I like that?"" ""Was that good? I can't tell."" I'm sure as they were getting into their cars, they realized, ""No, I actually really hated that movie. I feel taken advantage of. I am going to send a letter to the director requesting my money back."" Because that is how I felt. I am hearby boycotting M. Night Shyamalan's movies.",Lady in the Water

Shyamalan doesn't create movies for the masses. He creates movies for the few people who have high enough intelligence to get things out of them. He put his soul into that movie and you have to be at a certain level of intelligence and maturity to be able to understand the workings of a genius. I think its the same way with a lot of his movies. The sixth sense was, i think, the least like that, i mean, it was made more for the masses. I think that the more he has lived out his career the more personal and intense his movies get. It makes you wonder what his next movie is going to be like.",Lady in the Water

After seeing The Village, I almost gave up on him.Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard both give amazing performances.

In fact, I was surprised at how good Paul Giamatti was. He nailed it. It was scary when it was supposed to be, mysterious when it needed to be and riveting. So what that the director cast himself in a role? It was a big cast. I watched it twice through.

The movie revolves around Mr. Heep an average, affable man that is the lowly maintenance man for an apartment complex. The setting appears to be more the dilapidated motel, of course in the middle of nowhere. We have all the necessary and unnecessary characters introduced to us. The fact that M Night seems hell bent to keep us guessing as to who might be ""the chosen ones"", we truly go back and forth on this issue. This time around the ""monster"" is some lame grass creature that looks strikingly wolf like. Oh yeah we are seeing a movie that is suppose to be based on an old bedtime tale. A story related to Mr. Heep through the daughter of an old Asian woman who does not speak English (insert comic hilarity). We are to be drawn into this fable by Bryce Dallas Howard (the Village) not that she is not a good actress, but. The whole story of life altering proportions by the outcome is lame! Again I leave the theater felling bad, not because I wasted 110 minutes of my life but rather that M Night again got up to bat and only got a base hit.I however look forward to his next movie in great hopes that he will achieve the greatness that is within him.",Lady in the Water

The commercials sure made it look like horror, but it isn't. This movie really opens your mind and truly makes you think. The audience though..was really annoying. There was some old people laughing at the intentional humorous parts, and than the groups of kids laughing at the serious part when most of the theater was deeply involved in the movie. It gets off to somewhat of a slow start, with sloppy camera work, and constant scene changing, but when the Madame Narf from the Blue World comes into the story, the plot begins to become more clear and it gets better and better from there. At the end, you will probably leave the theater in awe and amazement after an incredible ending. It also is unlike anything else, and is one of the best movies ever made, unlike some of the other trash thrillers like ""Pulse"" and whatever other non scary scary movies are out now.

Lady In The Water wasn't quite what I had expected, and it was very refreshing. So many of the movies that are released now are awfully predictable, sometimes boringly so. This one wasn't, as well as most of the other M. Night movies. LITW was a modern-day fairy tale, not a horror flick. What would happen if the impossible appeared into the mundane? The characters are like so many people we all run across - the odd ones, the freaky ones, etc. Call me sentimental, but I think this movie was about transformations; Story helped to meet her destiny, Heep in facing his past. The other characters were involved in much the same way - as a group of 'normal' people who become part of an impossibly important moment. I loved this movie because it threw the daily cynicism that is all around us and transformed it into hope, peace, and friendship. What would you be willing to do for a stranger, or a group of strangers - even strangers you live with every day? View the movie again with that in mind.",Lady in the Water

This movie was slow from the get go, never really picked up and didn't give us a reason to even justify spending the 7$ bucks to see it. I genuinely felt cheated when the credits began to role. The writing was bad. Much of the dialogue was simple. I thought Giamatti at times was guilty of overacting, perhaps he felt the weakness in the plot and overcompensated? There was no mystery???? We are basically given an outline of the movie in the first 30 minutes. No suspense- I know this may be geared towards children, But parent must sit with children-because children cant go to movies by themselves- So we must make the movie at least a bit enjoyable for the adults.

These are the same people that have a good time watching Stick It.This movie had a solid story, and when you get past the childlike qualities (that you'd normally find in any fantasy story) there's something much more meaningful there. This movie wasn't about a narf trying to get home, it was about the world and the people in it and so many other things besides a big, silly bird flying to take a magical creature back to her world.And anyway, why would Lady In the Water be ridiculous but Lord of the Rings is not? This was an excellent movie, and people, really, just seem to love giving Shyamalan a hard time.I went with my friends, all of whom laughed at the movie. The rest of the theater consisted of a bunch of teenagers who kept running down the isles to go get candy while flashing their cell phones at each other. I know my friends, and they love the stupidest movies. I can't respect anyone's opinion who argues that this movie was ridiculous.YES, that's the point. It's a fantasy story. But so much more, if you'd PAY ATTENTION.And I apologize if this offends anyone, because I know I probably sound like a jerk, but people would rave about anything that has to do with terrorism or fire fighters, even if it completely sucks.

Your backyard becomes the most important place in the world. Things aren't as they seem and there's twists and turns. If some child in the world was being told a tale, the child's imagination is whats shown here.It is similar to Night's previous work in his method of wrapping a person's inner struggle around amazing twilight zone situations.

Honestly, I left laughing. At the beginning, the plot was believable, and I started to identify with the struggle the lady would have to face. There were many points at which I thought the dialog was exceptionally weak, but I figured I would not let it bother me if the movie turned out to be good.As the weak dialog became intertwined with the increasingly complicated story of the narfs v. scrunts, Story's story became less of an outlandish but curiously intriguing story, as I had originally perceived it, and evolved into a picture where I waited tensely with my companions for Harry Potter to appear on screen.The opening sequence was reminiscent of some of Jean Cocteau's film work, particularly some similar scenes from the Orphic Trilogy, and the rest just seemed like another mediocre Hollywood product. Shyamalan had a terrible habit of deconstructing his film from the inside, with comments made by characters that claimed that all stories follow the same outlines, and that ""this is like a scene from a horror movie."" I'm not convinced Shyamalan is a master or genius for this film, because if it was a statement about the progression of writing, why on earth did he waste two hours of my life to tell me everyone is emulating the Bible or Shakespeare by doing it himself? Anyway, it turns out the monkeys that are the most evil creatures in the world are so evil that they uphold the laws governing scrunt/narf relations, and that the Mama Narf just needed to go home, much like in a Disney Movie.

He must have seen a rerun of the movie ""Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid"" with William Powell and Ann Blyth, as this is so similar to the plot that Guy Jones and Constant Jones should be getting credit for the writing.The story is excellent, however, it belongs to someone else as far as credit of the writing goes.For the man to find a narf in his swimming pool is what William Powell found on a vacation in the hotel swimming pool, except it was a mermaid. The man in Lady in the Water protects the narf, just like William Powell does in protecting Ann Blyth the mermaid. The man in Lady in the Water is trying to get the narf back to story land and in the William Powell movie he is trying to get the mermaid back to the other mermaids in the sea.",Lady in the Water
736,NinjaGrandma,A joyous delight of a film!,10,13 August 2006,"This is probably the most delightful film I've seen in years.The key thing, as I see it, is to come to this film without any preconceived ideas of what it's going to be like. It's easy to say, ""Well, this is the latest Night film, so it's going to have a twist, it's going to be dark and scary, etc."" Umm ... it's not.What it does have in common with his other films is its detailed complexity. Little things mean a lot, just as in Signs or Unbreakable or any of the others. That's about the only similarity. In all other ways, it's a new departure. Matter of fact, this film is a new thing in film-making.It's not new, however, in bedtime stories--which is what the writer says it is, and he should know. This isn't a horror film, although there are some scary things; it's not a romantic film, although there are some sweet moments; it's not a comedy, although there were some things I just couldn't stop giggling about. It's a STORY. Wow. That is so rare today--nothing blows up, no car chases, just a good story.So who am I to make comments? I'm a mom, a grandma, a teacher (literature and history, middle school), and a martial artist (2nd degree black belt). I've told lots of bedtime stories, I've read a ton of books to students, I've read student stories, and I explore legends and traditions from all around the world. I love a good story. That means I'm probably like a lot of movie viewers--probably like most of the people reading this.At first, this film just seemed odd to me. That changed about ten minutes into the movie when I made a conscious decision to put aside my ideas of what the film was going to be like and just experience it, savor it for what it was. That's when it became a delight.I plan to see it again, and to buy it when it comes out in DVD. I will show it to students in my literature classes, as an example of good storytelling. It has all the elements of ""Story"" (in the literary sense, not the character in the film); it has a protagonist who is Everyman, a damsel in distress, a heroic quest, a frightening monster, and lots of wonderful everyday heroes. How can you not love a story in which a child reading a cereal box has the answer to a life-or-death question? One of the most perplexing elements was the ease in which everyone in the apartment complex (in my opinion, a microcosm of society) accepts the situation, which is obviously incredible. I loved it. That kind of suspension of disbelief, which is such an element of bedtime stories and fairy tales, is usually missing from our cynical culture. The belief in goodness and mystery is rare. One of the characters says, when things don't look so good, ""I really wanted to believe."" I think that's true for many of us. We want to believe in goodness and light. I really loved this movie for showing a vision of a group of people who believe.This movie is on my list of lovely films, along with The Princess Bride and Finding Neverland. What do they all have in common? Hope. That's a rare commodity today.Please see this movie with an open mind and open heart.Blessings, Ninja Grandma",Lady in the Water
737,sflood-5,Great Novel Storyline,9,18 July 2006,"I highly enjoyed this movie. It fits nicely with M. Night's body of work while carving out a more unique niche in his genre. It has good tempo with consistent theming that are punctuated with some comedic relief absent in his previous endeavors. The characters are nicely developed, and keep you guessing for a bit of the movie as it is not as predictable as you may think. All in all it was one of the more refreshing and original movie going experiences I have had in awhile. I would recommend this film whole heartedly, but some thematic elements and sequences may be a bit too frightening for younger children. As with original fables and fairy tales, it has scary elements imbued in it that are effective in their points. Enjoy.",Lady in the Water
738,pwr66569,Absolutely terrible,1,18 July 2006,"Wow! I have never been so annoyed by a movie in my life. If it weren't for the fact that I had driven a friend to the theater and had met others there for the sneak preview also, I would have left in the middle of it. And I never leave in the middle of a movie.Within the first half hour, the characters were already getting on my last nerve. The basic premise somewhat interested me, but the stupid characters coupled with an obvious attempt to solicit laughs based on a few ridiculously exaggerated situations and the main character's stutter throughout the movie really clinched it for me. And no, I'm neither a critic nor a fan of Shyamalan. I judge each movie on its own merit and don't give a damn about whose name is on it. I loved Sixth Sense. Unbreakable wasn't exactly my type of movie, but I found it entertaining and wouldn't take issue with it because of the genre. I really didn't care for Signs at all, but I didn't completely detest it. But I really hated this movie. I kept hoping that some bizarre twist would at least give the movie some redeeming quality in my eyes, but almost every turn they took was completely predictable. And the few things that were a bit of a surprise didn't help because they just seemed to me like an obvious attempt at being ""cutesy"".Oh well, I know there will be people out there who like the movie. I did hear a few people laughing at the stupid attempts at humor. Although, by the end of the movie, I was fairly convinced that people just wanted to laugh in order to avoid the awkward situation of silence when laughter is almost expected. It reminded me of when a lousy comedian takes the stage and you get a few people laughing at things that are completely not funny just because it seems to be the thing to do.At any rate, those are my thoughts on the movie. I have never written a review at this site before because nothing has ever moved me to do so like this dud. In fact, I hadn't even registered at the site even though I have visited it regularly for years. I've been kind of curious to read some threads, but was too lazy to take the few minutes to register in order to do so. No more ... the one and only good thing I can see about this movie is that it spurred me into action and now I'm a member here and can take a peek at the discussion threads whenever I want to.",Lady in the Water
739,kcboiz,Disappointment.,1,19 July 2006,"I could NOT WAIT till this movie was released!! Now, I wish I could take back my 3 hours wasted at the sneak preview last night! HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! I was ready for a suspenseful thriller & received nothing but a huge joke. :-(Want a suspense thriller? Than I suggest you watch the Previews for this movie, since I do believe they used them all in there. The rest of the movie was filled with a JOKE. You could not resist laughing at how stupid it was.I am glad this was a Free Sneak Preview, otherwise I would have demanded a ticket refund for this Falsely Advertised movie.",Lady in the Water
740,KRiccardi,touching and original,10,23 July 2006,"While I can't say this is a great film, I can say i was moved at one point to where there was a tear in the corner of my eye. There is no twist in this movie but as everyone's purpose is revealed it is entertaining. I found M. Night's performance believable but he is not necessarily a terrific actor. I have my theory as to why movie critics are so hard on this movie and I think because one of the central characters is a movie and book critic who is pompous and meets an untimely end. I loved the characters and M. Night's message and his obvious feelings about the state of the world. For the most part every actor did a fine job including Paul Giamatti and I am not even a big fan of his. I was moved by his story and the fate that was going to await the M. Night character as told to him by Story who is able to see a person's destiny. Be warned this is a message movie and a thinking movie so if action movies are your thing you probably won't like it. The ending is a little hokey but remember it is a FAIRY TALE so keep that in mind when the movie ends. I have also read some of the other people's opinions on this movie and I don't think they understood what his movie is about. It may be being marketed as a scary movie but it is really about human emotions and people coming together for a cause even if it is something that may not be believed. I say even for all of it's flaws it is a truly touching film and I recommend it to anyone with an open mind. I have thought about this movie since I saw it and I am also planning to see this movie again with someone who has not seen it. I think seeing it a second time will make me appreciate it even more.",Lady in the Water
741,MyDogSkip,Amazing!,8,20 July 2006,"9 words... You must be this tall to ride the ride.I originally came in to this movie with the intention of seeing a wholesome family movie filled with fairy's from another world much in the line of a Peter Pan I however came out of there with a whole new respect for Shaymalan's craft. It's been year's since I've experienced a roller-coaster ride of a film like this and let me tell you it delivers.The story can be summarized as little red riding hood with a modern twist. Judy lives in Manhattan. She's your regular paper pusher, for that regular big magazine firm. She drinks her regular coffee and eats her regular McDonalds. Well today was not going to be any regular day for her. After losing her job, spilling her coffee, and getting the wrong burger at McDonalds, she runs in to Peter Wolfsberger. Or as his friends call him ""Wolf"". Wolf comes on strong as he likes ""the cut of Judy's jib"". So after that it becomes a chase and a romp through Manhattan for her approval. In which during the chase she is approached by gangs, drug dealers and pimps. Things can't get worse for Judy. How does it end, well you'll just have to see for yourself!I took my children to this expecting a typical nursery rhyme story, but I came out with much much more. And above all, my children left with some good family values. Which is more than I can say their good for nothing mother is teaching them. This film delivers!",Lady in the Water
742,raj99,Original and Brilliant,10,21 July 2006,"This movie is Shyamalan at his best, the casting is brilliant and the story is fantastic. I had reservations about the movie after reading all the bad reviews but was surprised by the originality of Shyamalan's new movie. Paul Giammati plays Cleveland Heep and gives a great performance, as he always does. The story is well written and shown with brilliance. Cleveland finds a lady in the pool in his apartment building, where he is the manager. The lady is actually a fantasy character from a story trying to get to her own world and is stuck in ours. There are no big surprises, unlike Night's other movies but will keep you glued to the screen throughout the film. Shyamalan is simply a master movie maker.",Lady in the Water
743,rockerbaby662,very cute story,8,22 July 2006,"I really loved this movie. I liked the village, but i was a bit disappointed. I was really afraid this film would do that. Absolutely not! This is the type of film that was brilliantly cast, and it keeps you wanting to know what happens next. Bryce Dallas Howard needs and Oscar sometime in her career because she is a breath of fresh air and a joy to watch. She was very real in this film as was Paul. I'd say out of the three M Night Shyamalan movies i've seen (Signs, The Village, and Lady in the Water) this one is my all time favorite. I don't know why in gods name the critics are giving this movie poor reviews. I absolutely loved watching this movie and i can't wait to see it again.",Lady in the Water

I watched this movie in a theater packed with other people all excited about this film, however after its showing, more than half were at the box office demanding their money back. We pay money to be entertained in theaters, many were not entertained and therefore received rain-check vouchers. Bottom line,... go rent Sixth Sense.This movie was a tall order to swallow. Shyamalan has let all of his followers down and really has failed the viewing community this time. Please like I said go rent something else or watch Clerks 2!!!!!",Lady in the Water
745,cobradad,The Lady in the Water: a reaction,8,24 July 2006,""" in my opinion, despite the sometimes misleading strangeness of his works, it is difficult for an unprejudiced and knowledgeable viewer to deny or question the naive truthfulness of his art ...his continual search for the essential sign of each thing, a thousand significant details undeniably assert his profound and almost childlike sincerity."" The Isolated Ones: Vincent van Gogh by Albert AurierThis was perhaps the first kind review of Van Gogh's work; it was published six months before his death. Reviews of Lady in the Water find it ""far fetched,"" ""cock and bull,"" ""alienating"" and ""incomprehensible."" Some call it among the worst of the year. It affected me, like a van Gogh. A bedtime story, like water, is clear, simple and transparent. It is often heard in numerous iterations and piece meal, only reaching its conclusion when sleep comes too slowly.Like building superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), we can only receive this story once we have regressed to a milk-and-cookies simplicity, preferably letting the story roll over us in consciousness' twilight. Little wonder reviewers are having such trouble with it. Bedtime stories are filled with unequivocal characters and tidy, spoon-fed plots: angels, demons, heroes and heroines. The stories, originally oral history, are handed down generation to generation, culture to culture; they survive on the strength of some archetypal familiarity. The Lady In the Water struck profound chords amongst the group I brought back with me for a second viewing. Luckily half the group didn't know Shyamalan on sight or that he played a character in the movie. Their experience was so different from the reviews I've read that I found myself writing.The central intellectual question of The Lady in the Water spoken by the-man-whose-opinion-we-respect, Mr. Leeds played by Bill Irwin: ""Does man deserve to be saved?"" The emotional core of the film is Cleveland's absence from home when his world was destroyed. Cleveland's role in this story, his openness to the Narf and his healing power sources from grief and guilt. To save the Queen Narf--and perhaps the world--a cross section of mankind residing at The Cove must discover their powers and their true places in the unfolding story. Add to this the film's heart-beat background of war coverage and its final message delivered directly to the subconscious by Bob Dylan's lyrics (If your time to you Is worth savin' Then you better start swimmin' Or you'll sink like a stone, For the times they are a-changin')and it is easy to see this film as a cautionary tale exhorting us to ""be home,"" listen to nature, find our powers and help save our world from destruction because, like it or not, the times they are a-changin'.There is something new in the water we drink. Perhaps it is newly arrived, trickled-down melt from beneath our poles, something both antediluvian and prediluvian that's seeped into us while attempting to quench a spiritual drought. But we are writing movies like The Lady in the Water and (when not dissuaded from even being present by a hostile, critical world) we are hearing voices from the water. Many may not yet fully understand, authors and audiences can feel a truth without giving it a name, but this leads, hopefully, to an awakening. In these changing times if we do not awake to our power and our roles in that which is unfolding, our story will end badly. Time is running out for a happy ending. See Lady in the Water, feel the inconvenient truths you may not be willing to hear and please awake.Come mothers and fathers Throughout the land And don't criticize What you can't understand Your sons and your daughters Are beyond your command Your old road is Rapidly agin'. Please get out of the new one If you can't lend your hand For the times they are a-changin'.Bob Dylan",Lady in the Water
746,matt1704,"Not his best work, I miss Signs",1,21 July 2006,"How can I summarize this movie? Although the movie did have some very creative grass/tree monkey creatures, it was still a spectacular crapfest. Unlike Night's other works there was no plot twist in the end. In fact, there was hardly any plot at all. The story was drawn out, slow paced, and incredibly boring. The acting was OK, Cleveland Heep and the ""lady"" were portrayed well. Night, however, needs to stick to smaller roles if he wants to act in his movie. He came across pretentious in this film, a role that would have suited any of the other actors. The laughter emanating from the small crowd in the theater was not a positive reaction, but the same reaction as the crowd I was in when I saw Batman and Robin. Ouch. My only words of warning: If you must see this movie, don't spend the money at the theater. Watch a home version of it. And don't expect much.Have a great day!So I need more lines: Signs - My favorite, Unbreakable - Great comic book hero in the real world movie, Sixth Sense - Nice scary movie, Great surprise ending (but Usual Suspects did it better), Village - OK but went downhill once the creatures turned out to be fake, Lady in the Water - Crapfest, see above.",Lady in the Water
747,jolly_ranch_er,"Boring, Confusing and annoying.",1,21 July 2006,"Someone should have clearly slapped M. Night Sherman when he directed this film. Not only was it dull, it wasn't scary at all. There was no reason at all for it to be rated PG-13. At best, PG, for Pretty Gay. The main character is a bedtime story come to life. A red eyed dog with grass for hair is her only enemy. What kind of story line is THAT? An eagle is supposed to save the day, when really, he shows up at the last minute. The ending was much appreciated and quite abrupt, really. I couldn't decide if the girl just disappeared again or if the movie was really over, until the credits started rolling. This would definitely be a thumbs DOWN.",Lady in the Water

Maybe he figured or hoped we would just draw conclusions from what he laid out. I love this movie, with its humor, and suspense taking you up and down like a giant roller-coaster at an amusement park. Ron Howard's daughter did a wonderful job in her role, and I hope to see her in many, many more films of this quality. The Camera tricks, and feel reminded me of old horror movies, from the eighties. The cast was very diverse, and well chosen. Lots of surprises make for a GREAT movie.

749,debrath,There is healing in this movie!,7,21 July 2006,"I went to see the Lady in the Water and could not get up and leave once the movie was over, simply because it takes a couple of moments to absorb. It wasn't what I expected, and certainly had meaning beyond what you would think. It shows that every person has a purpose and everyone's purpose fits together for one reason. Also, until we release our pain, healing can't come for ourselves or anyone else. It proves that our lives are tied together and we affect all the lives around us. Go see this movie and give it a chance, because it will show that there is healing and purpose for all of us if we will allow it. There are a lot of spiritual truths in the movie, you just have to look for them.",Lady in the Water

With its inside jokes it gives you a sense about the commonality most big blockbusters have become. Then there are movies that truly grasp ones creative genius, and challenge you to think outside the box to find a more deeper meaning, I expected this from M. Night Shyamalan and I expect nothing but great films from him in the future. So here is the rundown, if you want the same old bang, shoot em up, sex, drugs, profanity, and of course remakes, then this is not the film for you. But if you want a truly unique journey into the mind of our times most brilliant writer, director and producer, then this is the film.",Lady in the Water

I fell in love as soon as the prologue started! I would say that this could be a spoiler. The creatures after Story (The Lady) were absolutely stunning in design, but lacked a more solid background and information. But they were certainly nightmare inducing.A Scrunt. The vague appearance of a wolf-like creature who could blend in perfectly on your front lawn, even in broad daylight! A very interesting and unheard of idea. And being a monster lover myself, I'm in love! The graphics were amazingly well done. I plan to make a desktop of one! Of course, the storyline itself was beautiful. And right on the verge of becoming a love story.In all, a terrific movie Shyamalan!",Lady in the Water
752,movieguy54,M. Night's new movie is fantastic!,10,21 July 2006,"The entire movie kept me on the edge of my seat with constant action, a great plot (something new and not like any other Hollywood film I can think of), and great acting. Lady in the Water takes place in an apartment complex and Paul Giamatti plays the superintendent of the complex who stumbles upon an ancient mystery involving Bryce Dallas Howard who holds the key in bringing the world change for the better. M. Night Shyamalan continues to impress and entertain the audience with amazing direction and a good use of symbolism and plot twists. He is one of the great movie makers of our time and I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes movies.",Lady in the Water
753,marinatedfreak00,Did I see the same movie as everyone else?,5,21 July 2006,"Let me start off by saying a couple of things.... I am not a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, but I did appreciate ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and ""Signs."" With that said, I went to see this movie with several friends expecting a fascinating film with a Shyamalan-esquire storyline, and not necessarily of the horror genre.Instead, I spent my $9 on a comedy.As everyone has stated, the movie is about a man - Cleveland Heep (Giamatti)- who runs an apartment complex, whose pool has a passageway that leads to the home of a Narf named Story (Howard). After Heep discovers Story, he slowly begins to notice bizarre and *horrific* events around his complex involving Story, and matches it with some Chinese Folktale.So the story is a unique and creative one, which I will give to Shyamalan. The fairy tale aspect is set ten minutes into the story, and I found the first half hour to be enjoyable. But when the movie takes its turn in trying to describe exactly what is going on, I, along with everyone else sitting in the packed theater, lost everything. What had started off as a simple storyline turned into an ultra-complex, bizarre, and rather silly plot that had me on the edge of my seat.... cringing and laughing. I mean... what? Why did a guild, an interpreter, a healer, kid talking to cereal boxes, grass covered monkeys, crossword puzzles, and eagles ever come into the equation? It almost seemed as if, in the middle of writing, Shyamalan decided to just become really lazy and just put all that junk into the script without developing any of it or giving any history to it at all. If the movie somehow gave a history or development of all the saviors of Story, then maybe I would have liked it. But the sudden comedic developments of plot that come out of left field, which somehow easily convinces every other character in the story, simply turned this movie into an utter disappointment.I can understand why fairy tale lovers would enjoy this movie. I can understand why people who want originality would enjoy this movie. But for me, the sloppy development and random junk ruined what could have been a potentially-great masterpiece.5/10",Lady in the Water

And if you don't pay any attention to the beginning black & white cave man stick figures that are basically narrating what the lady in the water is doing then you won't have a clue during the rest of the movie. The lady next to me fell asleep. The only reason why I went to see it, is because I thought it would have been scary. It wasn't. There was only one scary creature in the film called a Scruff; it was a grass dog with red eyes that tries to kill the Lady in the Water. And of coarse he doesn't kill her.

Lady in the water was a terrible, non-coherent film with no big twist (as in The Village), or real suspense. I literally was falling asleep. Personally i feel that M. Night should have stayed behind the camera. I'm not saying that his acting was poor, but he should have concentrated more on directing and less on memorizing lines. This movie was all over the place and the story was generally poor as well. To see all of these positive reviews reminds me of a quote by Mr. William Ferrel in Zoolander when he, as Mugatu, says ""I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!"" that pretty much sums up how I felt through the entire movie.",Lady in the Water

I feel this movie is for all ages. Even my husband liked it. A LOT! I think children ages 6 and up would really get this movie. Nights movies are meant to be different.

That Dialogue mentions Atlantis(The Blue World), and the Orator Prohecy. Yes, that story refers to a Midwestern President know as The Great Communicator. Am I right, could hint your political views?

760,pinkcoconut26,Lady in the Water is a beautiful piece of work,10,23 July 2006,"Lady in the Water is one of the most beautiful, touching movies I have ever seen. It is a movie where the theater does not need to be packed, nor does there need to be loud ""ooing"" and ""ahhing"" to keep your adrenaline pumping. Instead it is a movie which I feel is very personal to the viewer. It is one that will awaken something in individuals that they are not aware was ever there. If it does not accomplish this task in each viewer it has not failed. Instead it has succeeded if it has touched at least just one in this way and it did for me. M. Night Shyamalan has a beautiful soul and I am so in awe of his movie making abilities and how they react to humanity. Some may be skeptical and ask ""Lady in the Water"", how more unimaginative of a title can you have? Or may question how the trailers all paint a different picture of the movie. What I can say is that the movie shows how four simple words are a description of a woman who has a deep and powerful story unravel around her, where all the trailers' views come together to complete a view of life that cannot be felt in many of this summer's blockbuster hits. Go out and see the movie. You may choose not to but I know if you do, even if you do not have a positive opinion, you will be left with an opinion. And opinions bring change. Whether it be to the cinematic world or to the real world. And change is needed everywhere. Whether it be a village, a lady, or a little boy, all of M. Night Shyamalan's characters or settings provide a different outlook on life and where it can lead. Wonderful, wonderful piece from the director.

This was the message given in the movie Unbreakable. Similar one is given here. One should know his place in this world.Mr. Heep who is a doctor forgets he is a doctor and works as caretaker of that apartment The Cove, fixing pipe and bulbs. He forgets his actual job of a healer. He thinks himself as a guardian just because he saved the Knarf.People do the job all their lives... But when they know that is not what they are meant to do, they look so ordinary. Same is the case with the Mr. Interpreter. He looks so ordinary when things do not work for the first time with his crosswords. He knows it was not his job. Mr. Manoj Night Shyamalan has certainly carved an entertainer. Unlike most of his movies he starts on a comic note which is quite refreshing.Mr. Heep (Giamatti) does justice to his role. Howard also expresses with her eyes... Her face is blank but her eyes say a lot. The diversity in his characters is wonderful.

762,sparrow4242,Much better than I was led to expect.,8,22 July 2006,"While rather too self-explanatory, ""Lady in the Water"" was a surprisingly good movie. I'm a Shyalaman fan, and also a fan of modern-day fairy tales, so I may be biased, but I found myself riveted by this film. The acting was great, the special effects were good without being overwhelming, and both Paul Giamatti and Bryce Howard were excellent. I won't say that there weren't plot holes, but they were relatively few, and forgivable. If you don't like Shyalaman, don't see this, and if you don't like fantasy, don't see this. If, however, these are your cup of tea, then go, relax, and enjoy a well-told modern fairy tale.",Lady in the Water

Loved the obvious blurb in the movie to that effect. Had no idea that M. Knight wrote this story for own children. And a big plus for an optimistic plot. I knew there is hope for the world yet and the movie industry as well. Thank you Mr. Shamalan for seeing that need. I think I was a young narf at one time my parents always yelled at me for staying in the shower to long and to get out of the pool before I turned into a prune. Who knew I was a narf!

I went in thinking it was going to be just another twisty movie that he is famous for (which i like, but i was looking for something a bit different)but i was taken back by how well everything was done. The filming was amazing and different, and the story literally gave me goosebumps. The complexity of the characters is really what did it for me, he really developed them so you feel like you know them personally. I love the humor in the film, which was very smart humor, and indeed really a breath of fresh air, from what else I've seen lately. There are certain things that do make you jump, which keeps the movie very exciting. I really enjoyed the film and i plan on seeing it again this weekend. Maybe a third time as well.",Lady in the Water

Finding strength and faith inside your self. Lady In the Water was more then I had hoped for. The characters are so vivid and beautifully drawn that you immediately grow to love each one. Bryce Dallas Howard was beautiful and has followed up her role in the Village with another outstanding and heartfelt performance. Night has also proved himself to be not only an amazing director and screenplay writer, but a consummate actor as well. Paul Giamatti in my opinion deserves an Oscar nod for this performance. Cleveland steals your heart the moment he steps on screen, and keeps you riveted throughout the film. The story itself is both mystical and frightening. People who were disappointed by The Village because it did not have the ""scare"" factor they were hoping for will most likely not like Lady In The Water. But for those people who enjoy a story filled with drama, intense suspense, and a little magic will fall in love with Night's latest masterpiece. See it!!

But I've never seen anything like ""Lady in the Water"".If you watch this film expecting it to be like something you've seen before, you're going to be disappointed. If you come with an open mind and let MNS pull you into his fairy tale, you'll have a wonderful evening.It's tense, touching, funny, and encouraging.

767,manidalgo,"""Lady"" - Filling In The Empty Shell",10,23 July 2006,"Though there are many plot conveniences and moments when we're asked to suspend our disbelief more than the usual film, Shymalan's plots are far from the empty shells that critics are calling them. When watching Lady, my mind kept going back to the ancient mythology of early civilizations. Those creation myths and stories were always just a bit too fantastical and simplistic for me, in the modern era, to be able to experience them as more than ""empty plots,"" albeit in their time they had as much power as the Christian bible does in ours. The reason for my experience is simple - I didn't live in an early civilization.The myth of the Lady in the Water, related to us at the beginning of the film, is like an early civilization myth. But what keeps the movie from becoming an empty shell for me is precisely what makes myth a significant form of narrative. When you talk about myth you're not talking about plot. When you talk about myth, you're talking about how the symbols in the story resonate among people that created it. Myth is about a shared communal experience. Lady in the Water is a movie that centers around neighbors. And these neighbors soon discover they are the principles in this myth story, and must figure out who they are in the plot and how to make this bed-time tale come true, lest someone die and the potential for a positive future is lost.It's way out there, I know. But when these neighbors start figuring things out and the myth starts breathing, this viewer's empathy drive went into fifth gear. Shymalan's appearance as a pivotal character does nothing to detract from this. Sure, the plot is plenty full of ""conveniences,"" but so is the Bible and that didn't stop the Christians. The humanism in the story is enough to make you want to believe. The heart of the movie is explained by the very serious and pessimistic Mr. Leeds, played by Bill Irwin, when he almost desperately tells Cleveland Heep, ""I need this more than anyone else here. I need to believe that there's more purpose to this world"" (words to that effect).Looking back, I can accept that Lady in the Water is about empty shells. But these aren't the empty shells of a plot, these are the empty shells of people, yearning for a myth to give them meaning.",Lady in the Water

I asked an assistant at the checkout before buying my ticket was the film scary, and she said 'no not really, there is one place where you will jump but other than that its not extremely frightening!' I don't usually get frightened by films, and was scared by this film!! Fantastic film though! and very good performances from the cast, very convincing!!!! the music score is also excellent.

This movie is a breath of fresh air. It is an intricately woven bedtime story/fable/parable that offers twists and turns, some predictable, some less so, and even a dash of humor and commentary. It's a tapestry.The performances are at times quirky but never over-done. James Howard Newton's score is evocative and sounds like a James Howard Newton score. M. Night Shamalama-dingdong has done a really nice job with this piece and more than makes up for the debacle that was ""The Village."" He actually is a pretty good actor, too.I hope this movie makes buttloads of money because I enjoyed it way more than I have enjoyed a movie in a long time. No offense to Captain Jack Sparrow.

He IS the writer that will some day make a difference. I need to see it again because in my own excitement, I did not get the reference to Reggie having strength in only one side. Did anyone? Also, I wonder if M. Knight intended Story's trove cove to be similar to Ariel's in Disney's Little Mermaid. Mr. Shyamalan has, again, provided such a poignant message in a very innocent and fun back drop.

Not for the viewer who is expecting a horror flick. Lots of funny, witty dialogue. One must watch the movie knowing that it is a fantasy story. I would say that it is like Big Fish meets Signs.Absolutely fabulous. M. Night is brilliant. The plot is so original, and he executed it beautifully. All of the quirky personalities really brought the movie together. One of those movies you can watch over and over again. Not a ""chick flick"" by any means either. I went to see it with my boyfriend, and he couldn't stop talking about it.",Lady in the Water

Night did a great job of capturing that bed time story feel....and if you just understand that you get it....so let the little kid come out and sit back and enjoy....It has a good sense of humor attached to it, a bit of a scare and a big heart....concerning people from different lives coming together to work together.",Lady in the Water

I regretted spending my $8 (and talking my friends into going and seeing it with me) as soon as the movie began. I understand it is based on a bedtime story, but the cheesiness factor far outweighed any actual substance in the movie. The only thing my friends and I got out of it was a funny new word to use... ""scrunt."" The silly names, constantly changing out the roles of the characters, and overall uninspiring acting (although I thought Paul Giamatti was entertaining) made it basically a comedy. Having loved his previous movies, I hate to blast it, but it simply was not up to par.",Lady in the Water
774,mike_shep,An excellent 'Story',10,25 July 2006,"Before seeing this movie, I gathered the impression that people either loved it or hated it. I have to say that I fell into the 'loved' it category. As a fan of Shyamalan's previous works since The Sixth Sense, I was not disappointed with Lady. Paul Giamatti gave an Oscar worthy role as Cleveland Heap and Shyamalan gave a noticeable supporting role as Vick, who is a writer that lives with his sister.The setting being an apartment complex called 'The Cove' brought in a unique collection of actors that Shyamalan lets you love or hate or just 'wonder' about. Add in beautiful and mysterious Bryce Dallas Howard as the mystical 'Narf', you are lead down a long suspenseful road for most of the whole movie. Also really noticeable was the musical score which was beautiful, soulful and haunting at times. Dramatic scenes either had you jumping from fright, weeping at sorrowful times, or laughing with pleasure.To me Shyamalan is a master of storying telling. And this is exactly what this is, is a bedtime story for adults that have forgotten how to wonder at things in our world, and accept imagination as readily as reality. People who expect this to be a rehash of The Sixth Sense or Signs need to know this could not be further from the case and might be disappointed their are no 'major' twists. Their are a few minor ones that make you go whoa when you get near the end, but it has an incredible ending that you wont be disappointed with.I definitely think this has been the Best Movie of the Year, despite what critics say and how much money Pirates takes in.",Lady in the Water
775,mmaximus25,A wonderful tale for the child within the adult and for those who are still children,8,24 July 2006,"I feel sorry for those with little or no imagination that find themselves in a theater watching a fictional movie. Those individuals that want to hear and see a story, want to be surprised a bit; yet see and hear blank reality. They are truly unable to let a story use their imagination to help fuel the fire. They should stick to non-fiction books, road maps and steer clear of M Night Shyamalan.I sincerely enjoyed the movie. The critics that believe the movie was bashing the fairytale out as far as revealing the tale itself are mistaken IMO. This is a fairytale for adults not primarily children so it's inevitably hard to go from an adults mind of reality to the imaginary belief of the tale with those of little imagination period. I think M. Night is good at creating an environment where the tale is possible.I appreciate the way a child can watch this movie and simply believe. It gets tiresome trying to tell anyone what state of mind is best for any movie but it is true; In order to watch any movie, including M. Night's it depends on your state of mind.I loved the idea of the people living and being for a reason but a reason so berried; not a thought is given as to why. I enjoyed the fairytale and can only say that if you are a critic, say over and over to your self this is a fairytale for adults that children would more than enjoy; that a 12yr old and much more importantly the 12yr old in me could careless how abrupt Heeps begins to unravel the mysterious new comer ""The Lady in the Water"".For movie goers that love new stories, fantasy, ( not non-imaginative non-fiction drones) that want to forget a bit of the days responsibilities, reality and escape into a movie, this ones for you.

776,ethomas17,A Rich and Compelling Story,9,24 July 2006,"Once again, Shyamalan has crafted an amazing tale which invokes emotions, draws the audience in and still illustrates the possibilities of creativity and imagination on-screen. As always, one could be inclined to proceed in a cautious manner since many viewers are skeptical of Shyamalan's work. However, from the onset of the film, Shyamalan proves that his ability in storytelling and the subsequent translation to film is nothing less than extraordinary. Drawing upon a strong cast including the under-rated Paul Giamatti and incredibly alluring Bryce Dallas Howard, Shyamalan introduces the audience to a world of characters not unlike those found in a children's story. The plot unfolds appropriately and although it seems bit contrived at parts, it works to convey the crux of the story. One of the finer aspects of the film is that it does not step aside and allow critical components of the story to wane without in some way explaining or resolving it. This is a bit different from some of Shyamalan's other films in which the conclusion is compelling but sometimes hard to digest and ultimately not very palatable for some viewers. Overall, I highly recommend this movie for those who are both fans and not fans of his work as it opens up a few new doors while still keeping to the suspenseful and rich template Shyamalan is known for. Those who enjoy a good story will not be disappointed.",Lady in the Water
777,val-191,Don't believe the critics' nasty reviews of this movie!!,9,24 July 2006,"""Lady in the Water"" is one of M. Night Shyamalan's best movies as far as I'm concerned. I don't think that I have seen critic reviews that so differ from the movie experience as much as with this movie! Mr. Shyamalan must have made some people in the critic business very angry; could it maybe have something to do with what happens to the cynical film critic character in the movie? Either they are being vengeful in their reviews or they plain don't get the gist of the film! The characters are quirky and funny, and Paul Giamatti is an absolute joy to watch in this movie. The pace of the film is typical of Mr. Shyamalan's work, and it unfolds with many plots and twists. Just when you think you have something figured out, you discover a new tidbit around the bend. One thing people must remember is that it was based on a fairy tale he told to his children. I think that you must have a heart that lacks jadedness to enjoy and understand this film. It would be a real pity if people avoided seeing this film based on skewed reviews designed to hurt the director.",Lady in the Water

Well I actually think that Shyamalan did a rather splendid job with this movie. This movie has a very bizarre, yet mind-bending plot that I think was superbly written. The actors delivered their lines exquisitely and were just great actors. Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) captures you with the lonesome life he is living with the horrible events that happened in his life (I won't give it away). He seems like an innocent man who doens't know his purpose in life. Until he comes across a girl who changes his life. Giamatti, being the superintendent at a hotel, or apartment complex, joins the extremely unique residents with unique powers to set out and help this girl, who ends up to be much more than they all expected.I really think this movie was great and definitely worth the movie tickets.",Lady in the Water

As others may have stated, the whole time you are guessing and the plot twists take you by surprise. I think it went further than most M. Nights movies. Directed to let you know enough at the beginning to set the mood and once it takes off it keeps you completely glued to the screen. The point of the movie is less than subtle - symbolicly makes a stab at the humanity of man and the will to believe in the unbelievable. The cast was also great. If you are trying to decide what movie you want to see this summer, see this one, you will not be disappointed.

Problem #1 he was in his film for to long, Leave the acting to the actors. I'm not saying that his cameos are unwanted, don't get me wrong, I cant wait to see night popping in for his 3 minuets of acting fame but he needs to be behind the cam. Problem#2 The movie was great but for a M.Night film it felt like it was missing something. It could be the element of surprise or that mind blowing twist that not a single soul sees coming, I don't know. I do know that any other director could have made a film like this and night is not just any director. Sorry Night not your best film!!!",Lady in the Water
786,ChicoBridges,Great movie for the inner child,9,2 August 2006,"Personally I love this movie. It was so much fun and just had a fairy tail feeling in a real life sort of world. But on the same note it is one that you have to be in a certain mood to watch. If you go into the theatre thinking that it is going to be cheesy and stupid... it will be. But if you go into the theatre ready to accept the absurd and downright strange than you can have a blast.The plot line is very original and unfolds in a way that kind of keeps you in the dark (surprise surprise with M. Night). The warping and modifying of our vision of reality is great fun in my opinion. That combined with the humor, fear, darkness, and hope filled atmosphere really allows you to take what you want from it. The ending was very touching in my opinion and has a great message of redemption and, like I said, hope.Not everything was perfect of coarse, there were a few scenes and parts that seemed kind of cheesy and detracted from the movie. Lots of terms and names were kind of childish, but I suppose that makes sense since it is a child's story. -----The bottom line is that the acting, camera-work, and message of this movie that made it special for me. The sometimes childish and weird names and or words is what I didn't care for. Overall a great film-----",Lady in the Water

Having viewed most of his catalog, I can come to no other conclusion than this guy is the most overrated Director working in Hollywood. Avoid at all costs (along with the rest of his work). The scariest thing about this film..... apart from the fact that it'll probably do well at the Box office... is that it may be successful enough to allow him to create another.

And once nosy neighbors find a naked woman acting strange in the super's apartment, doesn't anyone think that's a little odd? Disney did the right thing in cutting ties, he no longer has it. Paul Giamatti is a fine actor, but I actually felt sorry for him, having to put up with this trash. I understand why the movie came from the bedtime stories M.

This is one of that kind of masterpieces that you find every few decades. The film talks about the dramatic, self-hurting and liberating act of creating. The pain inside Cleveland Heep (Giamatti) moves around the sad world in he which he lives in: certainly a great, dark cinematography. In this point, I want to remark Shyamalan's master class of image composing: superb. But the very point is the Story (both screenplay and character). They are mixed as one: reality and fiction, audience and characters... I read in a newspaper here in Barcelona (La Vanguardia, August 27) that Shyamalan is the ""writer of the impossible stories"". Oh, certainly, nobody else in the industry creates by now such a metalinguistic, poetic, creative, new-in-all-senses films like this. And no-one can make you feel like Shyamalan does. He is a romantic man.Neither Coen brothers when directed Barton Fink (another excellent film about creation) could imagine that the storytellers and their stories can be the same as ""The Lady in The Water"" proves.

791,cqford,quite a trick to crash and burn in the water,2,27 July 2006,"By far the worst of M. Night Shyamalan's films. It seemed like he wrote the entire script in one setting, making up convenient and predictable plot lines as he went along. Like one of my parents introducing new fairy tale characters with odd names when the plot of their on the spot bedtime stories got a little thin. Except I'm not five anymore so it couldn't keep my attention. The audience laughed much harder at the serious or poignant moments than they did at the jokes and satire. He made some small attempt to delve into the metaphysical, but he brought up pretty on the surface questions, which he made little attempt to answer. In short, the plot was all over the place and there was nothing about it that made you think, which was very disappointing considering the lasting effect of some of his other films. I don't know if he's just getting lazy or losing his touch, but I don't understand how someone who wrote the ""Sixth Sense"" could think this was an okay film to attach his name to. The only redeeming quality of the film was Paul Giamatti's performance. How he delivered some of those lines without them sounding completely laughable I can only sit back and admire.

Anyways, LADY IN THE WATER was worth every penny. M. Knight didn't disappoint me or my husband.There was no swearing, no sex and a feeling of faith and hope. Who cares if he was in his own movie. I never gave that a thought. I just sat back and enjoyed the story. It was nice not seeing guns and people getting killed and every other words a swear word and people jumping in an out of bed.His stories always leave you thinking and wanting more.

Well, a crime against woman-kind, anyway. So for all of you out there criticizing Shyamalan for stealing the show: sour grapes, baby. He's got it, and that's the way it's going to be.The movie, by the way, is a good one; the only way to get yourself disappointed is if you have expectations of what a Shyamalan movie ought to be.

Moviegoers need to suspend belief and enjoy this modern day fairytale.I laughed so much through the movie, but I was also moved close to tears several times. As in the other Shyamalan films, there are messages in the movie. What may seem to be a simple story is a complex interwoven film. I can't wait to see this movie again...and again...and again...till it comes out on DVD and I can own it.Lady in the Water may be my new favorite Shyamalan film!",Lady in the Water

The fairytale story reminds me of the hundreds I have read when I was younger and I love how the story is set in a modern day setting. The acting is fabulous and I was specially fond of the digital work of the ""scrunts"". I still cannot figure out what the major plot twist that everyone told me about prior to seeing the film, I can say that it lives up to it's reputation and is light and refreshing to see a film with such a variety of characters. Even if you happen to be a person such as myself that figures out M. Night Shylaman's plot twists far beyond when they are revealed, I still seriously recommend this movie and defend it.",Lady in the Water
796,owenvich,great start... suicidal finish,5,29 July 2006,"To me a great start is what usually keeps me from turning off a movie and thats definitely the only reason why i watched this flick.... I have to say i hate movies in which a story is predetermined by a cheesy myth.. for example in vampire movies or whatever (although they are skeptical about the actual existence of them) still always know that crosses and garlic and wooden impalement will kill them... how corny is that??? Thats the same in this movie, there is a predetermined Chinese myth that tells the story and finds the solution... It isn't an original movie.. same formula as any other extravagant tale but different caricature... In stead of vampires or wear wolves its a water chick and a canine with grass as fur.... hahahaha... if seriousness is the point of this movie, they missed the mark... if humor was the aim the hit it right in the bull (s).... matt owen (holland)",Lady in the Water
797,jamesledzeppelinbuchanan,How can anyone like this movie?,4,29 July 2006,"Lady in the Water was a huge disappointment to me, and was without a doubt M. Knight's worst work. The movie was as stupid as the bedtime story it was based on...what a narf? Oh and a scrut? How long did it take him to write this movie?This movie could have been so much better had it been thought out a little more. Or maybe if it would have been written by someone else.The only part of the movie that i liked was its cinematography, which seems to be M. Knight's strong point. Visually I liked this movie, but during the dialouge I couldn't help thinking to ""What?""I was so surprised at all the reviews on this website that I had to go as far as write my own review. That's how terrible I thought the movie was.",Lady in the Water
798,jo_virtanen,This is such a bad movie.,2,29 July 2006,"This movie is awful. It feels like M. Night is letting his past success get to his head and here is a movie that made me lose a lot of respect for his writing. Like someone already mentioned, I find it highly unlikely that the main character manages to gather a group of 15+ people to work together to free this nymph living in their pool. A pool frequently visited but yet people failed to find the entrance to her home at the bottom. Obviously, this is a fairytale, a bedtime story, but I feel it could have been done with some logic to it. Movies that are fictional still need logical and reasonable reactions from the characters!!! If I didn't watch this at my house, I would have walked out and not finished the movie. I gave this movie a 2 out of 10 simply because of the fact that Giamatti performs well and manages to save his part of the half-ass script.Another reason for my disappointment in this movie is that M. Night plays such a big role and has chosen to make himself out to be a great martyr in the movie. It's almost as if he made this movie only to have a chance to put himself in a role like this. To show the world how great he supposedly is. I think the fame and success is getting to his head! Hopefully M.Night will recover after this movie flops completely and come back fresh, realizing his mistake.",Lady in the Water
799,edibooks3,Great bedtime story,8,29 July 2006,"My husband and I read the unfavorable reviews this movie has garnered, then went to see it because I had loved the music and mood in the trailer. I understand the negative reviews but thoroughly enjoyed this movie. If you accept it as a bedtime story and watch it as a child (a major theme of the movie), it works. In fact, it brings a pleasure and satisfaction that more critically acclaimed movies do not. It was a lovely tale, complete with mythology, oddball characters, unexpected saviors, a sprinkle of humor, and a very gentle and kind pathos. Some of the plot may have been contrived, but then it usually is in bedtime stories.",Lady in the Water
800,markcov,Disney was right in turning this one down.,5,30 July 2006,I had been advised before viewing that the plot is not believable and to think of it as a bedtime story. It didn't help. The fantastic acting wasn't enough to pull this mundane script out. I laughed a few times and enjoyed the richness of some of the characters but didn't really feel like I'd been entertained enough for the admission price. Supposedly Disney asked for a rewrite of the script and M. Knight opted to release it with Warner Bros. They probably figured they'd lose money on this one but make it up on the next one that hopefully M. Knight will listen if told it's not ready for release. I'm still a fan of his and will definitely see his next movie.,Lady in the Water
801,killanugz,"No sir, I didn't like it!",1,30 July 2006,"This is my first time reviewing a movie, but I thought I had too because there is no way I can get the couple hours of my life back I wasted watching this movie. To me, the rest of my party, and apparently the entire audience, there was no point to this movie. I thought the general idea was good, but there was absolutely no plot to it. The movie is a fantasy, but at least the human elements of the movie could have been realistic. First off, every character in this movie seems to believe everything they are told. IF some guy came up to me and started rambling on and on about a ""narf"" I would laugh in his face. Yet, he doesn't even have to work to get people to help him out with whatever he is trying to do with this woman. Then watching a group of 35-50 year olds party like they were at a fraternity keg party was priceless. Weird beasts are running around outside that are covered in grass (another thing that had me laughing) and yet nobody seems to notice. Eventually the narf is saved and the grass covered wolf thing is beaten up by grass covered monkeys and an eagle comes to get the woman. Then it just ends. You don't see where the woman goes, you don't see what happens to anyone else for that matter. I wish I could let myself believe a bed time story from somebody in order to try to save some strange woman whom we never find out why she needs to be saved. At least I stuck it out and watched it until it ended, which I can not say for half of the audience. This is the first movie I have ever been to where half of the people just got up and left because it was that bad. It made no sense to me. I have read other reviews from people who liked it and it still doesn't make sense to me. I hope it never will!",Lady in the Water
802,katiestrawberry5,His borrowed ideas,10,31 July 2006,"I have found that, in order to understand the movie, some background is helpful. M. Night's ideas in the movie are not new. The story in which he brings the ideas to life, however, are. The idea that humankind has become too preoccupied with acquiring goods and has become deaf to the words of their helpers that reside in another world is a notion also held by James Redfield, author of ""The Celestine Prophecy"" (also a movie) and ""The Tenth Insight"". The idea that each being has been placed here with a specific gift is also relayed in Redfield's books along with the author Duane Elgin. I think one of the greatest messages in the film is that no one is left without a gift. Everyone believed without a doubt that they were just normal, semi-boring people living together in a mediocre apartment complex. Story even confessed that she was often times clumsy and the other girls would make fun of her. She couldn't fathom that she was one of the most important tools in setting humankind on the right path. Even better, the entire world-changing event played out in an apartment complex, sending the message that we can change life as we know it even in the most mundane places. It didn't happen in a Buddhist's sanctuary, or inside a church, or on some supposed ""holy land"". People spend their lives and money searching for ""it"" (whatever that is) all across the world when it can be found wherever you are. It's a wonderful message that should empower you after you've walked out of the theater. To know that YOU have a specific gift inside that can help the world evolve into a more loving place is all you should need to begin the search.",Lady in the Water
803,fbiaturne,Bryce Dallas Howard's Best Perfermance Yet....,9,31 July 2006,"This movie has all of the elements of a Shyamalan hit, but is tempered and underscored with restraint. It does not contain the 'in-your-face' twists or blatantly bizarre story-line changes; however, it does have one of the most provocative plots Shyamalan has presented an audience. The symbolism is still just under the surface, and the acting put forth by Bryce Dallas Howard is amazing. You are no longer just an audience member watching a movie, but a part of the community of the apartment complex, drawn into the story to help the characters. Shyamalan has found a rare gem in Howard, and I look forward to seeing many more of her movies. This movie's contrasting subtle tone and strong storyline displays not only Shyamalan's great capabilities, but Howard's stellar growth as an actress.This movie is not only entertaining and thought-provoking, but well-written, solidly acted, and thoroughly produced. I will see it again in theaters, and then buy the DVD.",Lady in the Water
804,Sydermelon,Bring a pillow; and have someone smother you with it.,1,31 July 2006,"OK, I'm a Giamatti fan. But this movie was terrible. Flat, trite, oozing false emotion and sentimentality. The story is weak, if you want to be generous and not curse. The directing is horrible, with long lingering shots that are actually out of focus. He's trying to be arty, I know, but the back of Giamatti's neck for 40 seconds, most of which is out of focus, was a bit too much.The only things to applaud in this movie are Giamatti's and Bryce Dallas Howard's performances. He is like Sisyphus rolling a heavy rock up the hill, and just when you think he's going to pull it off, Shyamalan pulls the rug out from under him. Howard is perfectly cast as an other-wordy beauty. She has ethereal looks that are strange and beautiful all at once. The one non-cliché in the whole movie.Also, Shyamalan cannot act; his scenes are painful to watch, and when you realize he was directing himself, his narcissism astounds. Course he's going to change the world and be this terrific martyr. Puleez!",Lady in the Water
805,trogglbey181,Awesome Film,10,31 July 2006,"This movie was one of the best I've seen in many a ticket. It was as refreshing a shift from the ordinary as ""The Sixth Sense"" and as mind-blowing as ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."" The symbolism, thematic continuity, and strategically placed ""jump moments"" combine in a way rarely seen in film today. The film was aptly called a ""bedtime story,"" but with a twist I think Shyamalan alone could have pulled off. His signature is on the film from the beginning (not to mention his face ;)). I was delightfully surprised and eternally ""on the edge of my seat"" as the saying goes. Its ability to create tension without predictability was beautiful. It also contained an originality I have not seen in recent times. The present obsession with remakes and forgotten ideas has been draining and it is a blessed relief to see such a film in theaters today. I repeat; a refreshing and marvelous film that is well worth the price of a movie ticket. Spoiler: *Just beware of those damned sprinklers!""* B.",Lady in the Water
806,moderatefanatic,I've got some ideas,5,31 July 2006,"This movie seems like a little experiment. I think he made a normal Hollywood movie and simplified it to show its own absurdity. more of a lesson in not watching stupid movies than an attempt at writing a good movie. or maybe its some metaphorical masterpiece that i am not able to understand, which is possible, either way i feel the same about it as of now. if you do watch the movie i think its important to ask why? why does the wolf thing want to keep her in the world, why does the eagle take her away, why do the monkey things uphold the law, what and why is there a special narf, why does one guy have a really big arm and a normal arm, what does it all mean??? i don't even think it means anything but i don't know. i do think its rather telling that this was originally a bed time story he wrote for his kids-KIDS. i think he was saying something there. if you have any thoughts on it i would like to know so drop me a line.",Lady in the Water
807,Isotope11,Offbeat but beautiful story,10,1 August 2006,"The story starts very slowly, so the average viewer will no doubt be bored and do nothing but complain for the rest of the film and miss all the quirks and beauty of the story. That said, if you're ready for a trip back into the innocence and naiveté of childhood, this is the movie for you. As with any fairy tale, the story is not complete and holds a thread of speculation that will not be resolved by the end of the story.The characters were wonderful in that they all had a cynical personality that faded fast in the promise of a glimpse into a magical world. In addition, I loved the fact that Story, the narf, was not a great beautiful mythical creature, but instead seemed to be cognizant of her faults and as surprised of her important role as the humans who were gathered to help her.Contrary to my expectations, the movie was not frightening nor the least bit creepy, just filled with a childlike sense of wonderment. Obviously, this movie is not aimed at young children, or even a family, but at the adult who still wants to believe in fairy tales. This is definitely a movie to view with an open mind.",Lady in the Water
808,ScreenTreats,A Fantasy Not a Horror,8,1 August 2006,"Lady in the Water (LITW) has surreal and lasting effects. I experienced a charged sense of awareness which lasted for hours after the movie, and the moral of the movie has me writing this review, actually motivating me to action more than a week after I watched it. (Can An Inconvenient Truth claim that? Or anything Michael Moore has touched?) The movie is powerful.Certainly, there are several conspicuous flaws in the script which are distractions, but the story itself is admirable. The direction is sufficient, held back by a pedantic sequence introducing the eccentric characters. This is disappointing coming from M. Night Shyamalan (MNS), as were the absurd scenes with a stereotypical Asian mother and daughter. MNS's name by now is synonymous with masterful direction, as it should be, but he makes these terrible missteps here. There are creative visuals and his confidence in what he shows (and doesn't show) which redeem his reputation, for the most part. His style is obviously progressing. It is worth going to the theatre for his style alone, I think, but there is more to the film than style.The character Cleveland Heep earned my sympathy and interest, especially as evoked by Paul Giamatti. Perhaps MNS's characters this time around are more an array of oddities than complex, substantial individuals. Truthfully, the whole weight of the movie is carried on Giamatti's slumped shoulders, and he supports and carries it supremely well. He raises Heep above the mere eccentricities and clichés that are passed off as characters for the rest of the cast (the mythological beings exempted here). MNS is entirely fortunate to land Giamatti, although as I went into the theatre I thought it was the other way around. But that is the way with MNS's movies. One walks away from them viewing the world  and hopefully oneself  a little more keenly and gently and with a little less certainty and complacency. Some of the audience will leave LITW emboldened because of Giamatti's performance and MNS's power to transport audiences into his creation, seducing them into embracing his message.If you prefer not to be engaged on any genuine level, then please avoid LITW and go see the regular fanfare that gluts the market. Please stay away from LITW, so there are no more disparaging and wrathful reviews of it. Why is it that Marquez can write ""A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings"" and is handed the Nobel Prize for Literature and MNS writes about a narf and the full brunt of Western criticism censures him? Is it because the movie is too self-aware? Is it because MNS reveals his cards too steadily and unimaginatively and cheats us of some of the mystery? Okay. These flaws annoyed me too, so I even squirmed in my seat from uneasiness because the exposition was embarrassingly naked. Okay. Good criticism. I, too, wished Shyamalan would have forestalled the blatant explanations and committed more of the mystery to us. But what about Giamatti's adept portrayal of a man exquisitely lonely and yet unreconciled to this fate? What about the affirmations the movie has for its viewers? What about MNS's craftsmanship? What about the jumps and starts he gives the audience? Don't they deserve praise and approval? If it was a different director they would. Shyamalan is treated the way a teacher treats the gifted student. He is held to a stringent standard, which the reviews do not explain, whereas the likes of Oliver Stone, George Lucas, or Kevin Costner, the average pupils, are heralded as geniuses and/or awarded Oscars based on a poorer scale.Despite the atrocious marketing, this is no horror movie. MNS has never made one, so why do audiences expect that this should be? LITW is a fantasy, a tribute to the significance each of us has, and for that I applaud it loudly. It stands comfortably alongside Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter (closer to Potter). I'm not on my feet applauding, but I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out. This movie will endure, admittedly not on a mass scale because most of the movie-going public wants to be anesthetized, not inspired or invigorated. For the few of us ""remnant enslaved"" who need encouragement, let what is dramatic, poignant, and inspiring in this movie lift and transform you. It did me.",Lady in the Water
809,criticsilverlpz,Lady in the Water,9,3 August 2006,"Although it seems like a lot of people really did not enjoy this movie, personally I loved it. I think people look too hard into the fantasy side of this movie and expect things in all the wrong places. Lady in the Water is probably one of M. Night Shymalan's best movies yet. The negative reviews on this movie reminded me of how many people did not enjoy the Village. Again, I loved the Village. The problem is people are expecting too much out of just the previews. The Village, for example, was not a horror movie, yet many people walked away disappointed because they were determined to get scared. Lady in the Water is a character-driven movie that starts off weak but ends extremely strong. Hey, if the Japanese can send their confusing story-lines in horror movies to America than we can definitely look deeper into Lady in the Water.",Lady in the Water
810,nefaramolantsu,Mr. Shyamalan Lightens Up a Bit,8,3 August 2006,"As per usual, M. Night Shyamalan tried to bill this movie as a mindless horror thriller, and this time I think he really should have given that reputation a rest. We know that he hasn't made anything that's actually chilling since The Sixth Sense, and that what we really love his movies for are their originality, imagination, and story telling (and of course, those famous ""twists""). What we have in Lady in the Water is actually a light-hearted mystery turned fantasy, with moments where the audience is trying to make guesses like an old fashioned who-dun-it. The movie pokes fun at all those who try to guess his endings, the critics who claim there are no new stories, and those who say that the ""creatures are best left unseen"". Paul Giamatti does an amazing job at being ordinary and inexpressibly real. One of my favorite things in fiction is when the author of the world stretches its boundaries and plays with the idea of its own falsehood. Shyamalan used that device carefully and intriguingly. There are moments where the characters refuse to believe in the fantasy of the story, and the whimsical fairy tale pokes its head out into reality. The underlying message in the end being one of hope, ""re-illusionment"", and to tell the dreamers to keep on dreaming. I came away from this movie inspired, and with a feeling that I had just watched the new Peter Pan for adults. It's a wonderful story, that can be uplifting and enchanting for it's duration, and then leaves dumps you back in to real life.",Lady in the Water

As usual we ignored all of the negative comments and decided to go any way. A group of us, family and friends, went to this movie. We all really enjoyed it and felt that it is getting bad reviews because a movie critic in the end comes to a nasty but delicious end. Even the kids liked the movie. There were many instances when the whole audience was laughing in unison. Wonderful quirky characters, a slightly scary story and great actors. No scarier than the Wizard of Oz.

812,jimcin01,A story of connection and purpose-one to remember.,10,4 August 2006,"As usual, this is a thinker's movie. As usual, there are trademarks and references to faith. There are some questions that may arise: ""How can something evil judge rightly over evil?"" ""Is the evil judge truly evil or has man created rumors, due to a lack of understanding that something might exist without the benefit of having been created?"" Oh, the questions! My spouse and I happily contemplated ideas and concepts all the way home. Unlike other of Shyamalan's movies, the story within a story with it's ultimate message, was a little bit harder to decipher this time. Somehow, though, it was still wonderful and dreamy, perhaps even more so because there's so much to think about after leaving the theater. Absolutely, it's understood that there is purpose for every human, and that there is no room for power struggles if we plan to work together for the common good, or even for the good of a single being.There is just enough horror without being horrible, and just enough humor without losing the seriousness of the mission. We greatly enjoyed it, never became bored, and were very glad we chose it over the others available tonight.",Lady in the Water
813,hawkman12234,That was the worst movie i've ever seen,1,4 August 2006,"Shyamalan's lady in the water left a bitter taste in my mouth after i finished watching it. I have to say, that was the worst bedtime story i've ever heard.In all honesty Shyamalan's only success has been the Sixth Sense, given its originality; however, his attempts at replicating this originality in his other films has earned him the scathing tongues of movie critics.Shyamalan loves to borrow things from his old movies, he loves to borrow ideas as well as people. Bruce Willis: The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Joaquin Phoenix: Signs, The Village, and Bryce Dallas Howard: The Village, The Lady in the water. He's used water as the weakness for both the hero in Unbreakable and the aliens in signs, and now he uses water as the cure for the narph in the lady and the water. This play between people and ideas gets boring and the movies become frighteningly predictable.The Lady in the Water goes further it tries to present a ton of elements in simple ways, and ends up creating an amorphous plot. Half the time i was confused as to what was going on, and the other half was spent yawning at the predictability. Nothing flowed well together, and the characters lacked true conflict. It seemed that everything worked out in the end, with very minimal effort on the part of the apartment people. The narph only ends up getting a few scratches from a wolf creature that just looks like its had adobe photo-shop done to it. Nothing exciting happens,and everything follows along the same path as the eastern folklore recited in the story.Honestly watch the first 4 minutes, that explains the entire 102 remaining minutes of the movie (give or take a few minutes)",Lady in the Water

The story kept me interested the whole way through right up to the happy ending.(isn't that what we all want some of the time?) Sometimes it is nice to see a movie that is direct and fresh without superfluous special effects and that is precisely what M. Night Shyamalan does here once again.

That little girls part wasn't in the movie at all. They advertised the movie before it came out as a scary movie and then a week after it released it changed to a magical, fairytale story. I thought the movie was awful. The movie had a lot of holes and everyone just kind of went along with everything and didn't ask questions. It was a strange movie with weird character names.

Disappoionted as I am now, I would have to label my thoughts ""idle hope"".The film is not doing anything but putting forward a good example of how trying to mix a little fantasy with a flavour of the real world could turn out to be a tasteless blend. It's truly nothing more than a chain of corny events. From Cleveland Heep communicating with Story who's in the bathroom through Anna Ran to the writer who seems to know that he's starring in a film. Instances of Shyamalan trying to use a little comedy in ""Lady in the Water"" are numerous, but his creations are just not funny.Halfway through the film I wondered: ""Well, is there anything gonna happen?"", to which the answer is ""yes"", surprisingly. Though, only one thing which is Cleveland healing Story which involved confessing to his laid wife and children. After that, the film is just as boring as it was before that one moment.In closing; it's a shame..the film could have been so much better.

I think it very hard to believe that there are so many closed minded people in the world. And who could possibly over look the humor. Shyamalan did an absolutely brilliant job. I can't see this story being told any better. It's obvious how much work he put into this. Call him self absorbed if want he has every right to be. And believe he picked all the right people to play part in his master piece.",Lady in the Water

Odds are that most will go ""oh, this is the most incredible movie on the year  gonna be a cult etc."" This will happen because people are frightened that they may be ridiculed for their ignorance if they admit they have absolutely no idea what the movie is about. Think of H. C. Andersen's The Emperor's New Clothes is all I can say. THERE IS NOTHING THERE. No brilliance whatsoever  just a really really bad movie that one should not waste time or money on.

Absolute rubbish from start to finish. I'm in shock it made it to the cinema. There is no continuity, the story doesn't make sense, the little bits of info you are given about the characters are irrelevant and never gone into in more detail. The characters have no depth as you don't get any history on them apart from the odd tit-bit which as I said then isn't explained so isn't worth anything.

826,hatchepsut1,much ado about absolutely nothing at all,1,28 August 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan has always been one of the greatest directors and story-tellers in my opinion. In fact I saw the movie JUST because he was the director. Masterpieces such as ""Sixth Sense"" and ""The village"" are more than enough to make a director-screenwriter-producer a master. But I did not expect such a lousy movie as ""Lady of the Water."" I spent close to two hours expecting something to happen, trusting the good taste of Shyamalan, Trusting that there would be something that made sense (other than the characters trying to regain their innocence, in some way), but the only thing worth mentioning, and he did an excellent job considering how unworthy this movie is coming from Shyamalan, is Paul Giamatti, who plays the main role. I understand it's a fairy tale for adults, but the way in which it's told is so wrong, so disconnected. What a waste of time. ""Night"", (I know that was your nickname) I really hope you do better next time! I KNOW you can do better! But don't repeat anything like this. I could tell that the audience left feeling cheated. It wasn't only me. I've wasted a whole evening I could've spent doing much more interesting things, such as cutting my toenails! Please use your incredible talent as you used to!

I will instantly add it to the very short list of films that I give to friends, suggest people watch, and watch again myself for the sheer fun of it.I found 'Lady in the Water' to be a delightfully classic feeling fairytale, though that is just the beginning of this film's genius. In addition to skilled performances on a master story, this film gracefully delivers forgiveness, wisdom and compassion. These messages and examples imbuing a story that is beautiful, funny, and scary? That is a rare treat indeed.Bravo Mr. Shyamalan!",Lady in the Water
828,dunkle908,"Absolutely loved it, despite flaws",9,9 October 2006,"My boyfriend and I decided to go see Lady In The Water at our university last night. They show movies that have just left theaters and haven't quite made it to DVD. I had read many poor reviews of this movie over the months, so I went in with low expectations. I must say, however, I was pleasantly surprised.Story, a narf, or sea nymph, is discovered by Cleveland, a super at an apartment complex. She saves his life after he slips and rolls into the pool. Long story short: he enlists the help of other tenants to help her get away from the scrunts (sp?) and get home to The Blue World.Now, after reading all these terrible reviews about how awful this was and how Shyamalan has slipped downhill, I felt compelled to write this. First off, the story is a STORY. Yes, it is set in present-day Philadelphia, as are all of his major films, and yes, it has ""realistic"" characters (aside from the faerie-tale types like Story and narfs and all that). But he wrote this story as a fantasy. It's not a horror film, although there are some rather creepy parts, it's not a comedy, or a romance, or an action film. It is FANTASY. There are reasons the film has such unbelievable characters--what bedtime story doesn't? Take a look at Cinderella or Snow White. Who goes around wearing glass slippers and has some old bat turning mice into people? Who poisons apples and who keeps girls in comas in glass coffins? Come on, people...see it for what it is.I felt this movie was highly imaginative, though somewhat flawed. There are a few too many characters, so that tends to clog up the plot and the screen. The university student always seems to expound on the faerie tale whenever it is convenient. And the when-to-stutter/when-not-to-stutter thing kind of got on my nerves. But overall, I loved this movie. I found it to be far different from his other films (all of which, except Unbreakable, I also loved), but not so much that it was as far beneath the others as most reviewers like to say.",Lady in the Water

You will hate it with the passion of a thousand Latin men.The characters are wooden to the point of being all carved from the same tree. They're static, stupid, and worthless, with gimmicks just tacked on so that we can differentiate. The Director's arrogance is unheard of, and let's not forget the blatant attacks against film critics. This film will fill you with hate, anger, and rage, if you have any sense at all.",Lady in the Water
830,shamelmom,What a pleasant surprise,9,27 August 2006,"I walked into the theater today knowing exactly what to expect from Mr. Shyamalan's newest movie! Was I surprised. I did not jump out of my seat once, nor was I certain throughout most of the film that I had not missed something significant. At first I felt a growing sense of disappointment, however as the movie progressed I found myself developing relationships with the characters, especially Mr. Heaps and Mr. Leeds. The character development for many of the roles was great and I found myself wishing some of these characters and I mean ""characters"", were my neighbors.For me many of these characters were people I know and their stories were stories I have heard before. Although a bit slow in some places, (very few) and confusing at times, I found myself transported back to the days when Hans Christian Anderson was read to me, bringing back fear and excitement and the desire for a happy ending, (not always the case with Anderson). I loved the whole idea of being drawn into a Fairy Tale to assist the characters of the story.I so love Mr. Shyamalan's other films and once I let go of trying to turn Lady into a mold that fits his other films, I found myself delightfully entertained and smiling like a child on the way out.I do hope there are future Village and Sixth Sense films, likewise I am so excited about a new Shyamalan future. I believe he is another Spielberg, an artist who will provide me years of surprises and brilliant entertainment. I recognize now that this is an individual who will grow, change and continue to challenge the industry. He has given me the chance to be surprised with an industry that does not often provide surprises. To be sure I love films and surprise is not all that is required, however what FUN!! I already want to see the film again and have now convinced my daughter it is not too scary and she must see it on the big screen.I do not make a habit of reading reviews. I read story lines to eliminate those stories not to my taste such as slashers, excessive violence etc., however I was told by several friends that this movie was not any good. Don't listen! Don't go into it with preconceived ideas either, but by all means go and ENJOY.Is it my favorite Shyamalan film, well yes. It is my favorite new style Shyamalan film. I hope there are still some future Sixth Sense and Village stories, but I also hope there is no end to his changing ideas and stories. Thanks again for a wonderful experience Mr. Shyamalan.",Lady in the Water

Thanks Shyamalan.",Lady in the Water
832,jaipir,"Lack of ""punch""",6,31 August 2006,"Maybe, most of the people who have seen the movie, was expecting any kind of final surprise. I understand that, regarding the previous films, Shyamalan has, in a certain way, created some expectation toward his films, due to that ""final surprise"". But this one is quite different. Don't be mistaken, there will not be ""final surprise"", there will not be that sensation that something hidden is happening throughout all the movie. There's some lack of ""punch"". Personally, I think this movie lacks of that ""subtle mystery"". Everything is shown. In part it can be good, as we can be used to Shyamalan's new ways.

834,veronikakapoor,"""Lady in the water"" is not kind of movie to be labelled at once, provokes deep afterthought",8,3 September 2006,"What I really liked about this movie is that just after watching it you cannot figure out whether you liked it or not. But you can say for sure that it intrigued you to the core and provoked some deep afterthought.For example, while watching the film, one gets abashed by such gullibility of the tenants of the building, how they can so easily be taken in by this implausible pool story. Some viewers here find readiness of the main characters to help Narf (Lady in the water) quite far-fetched. That's what our mind tells us. I suggest to watch this movie with an open heart without trying to analyze each bit while watching it. Don't forget, it's a bed-time story meant for kids. Do they question and rationalize fairy-tales their mothers tell them before going to sleep? We are in a way these kids, as well as the characters in this movie who are helping Story to get back to her world. If you watch this movie without any prejudice, the message becomes quite clear. It's all about us being linked in this world, helping each other, loving each other. When one realizes all that, it's easier to understand your purpose of life, as it happens to the characters of this movie. Most of the modern movies are meant to be devoured one by one, some of them are enjoyable while watching, but forgotten the moment they are finished. Thank you, Mr. Shyamalan, for all your cinematic chef-d'oeuvres, which luckily do not fall into the category of such kind of movies.",Lady in the Water

836,ldrinkyourmilkshake,"Not bad, but takes itself too seriously",6,7 January 2007,"Anyways, I think that this movie was a really nice idea that just didn't work out that well because it was trying to create a meaningful story built on a legend we basically learned about five minutes ago and actually haven't finished learning until basically the end of the movie. While this was probably the format night wanted for the story, it loses us a little bit because we aren't concentrating on how great it is that everyone has found their place, we are trying to remember what exactly what is going on.This movie might have worked better if the background that we had to learn about the blue world was not treated as such a grave and serious legend, because honestly, it is very hard to take seriously. I think that was the fatal error of the movie - it took itself a little too seriously. If the story hadn't been treated as such a grave LEGEND and had been treated more as the whimsical bedtime story that it actually is (it is referred to as a bedtime story at times in the movie, but is never treated as such) I think that the movie would have been a little easier to take. It would have been nice if the movie went a little more for the Princess Bride sort of vibe - a story you can get sucked into because its simply a story - its not gospel.LITW wasn't m. night's best film, but it definitely could have been worse.",Lady in the Water
837,longlegs_2000,review,9,9 September 2006,"The story came from a fairytale, a children's book but the fear came from the soul, it will scare the pants off you, and grip your brain with the mind-puzzling adventure. Your emotions will confuse you, as you laugh, as you cry but the only thing to want to know is, will the narf survive? M.Night.Shyamalan (writer of the Village, Signs and The Sixth Sense)has brought us a magical, exciting, sad but scary film, with 'Lady in the Water' The film begins with a stuttering middle-aged apartment superintendent, Cleeveland Heep (played by Paul Giamatti) continuing with his daily job at a hotel, when he sees someone (or something) in the pool. As he investigates, he finds a creature. A beautiful narf called Story (played by Bryce Dallas Howard). The fairytale then unravels as we follow the story of this narf. We watch and learn that every single character is as important as the next, and every person has needed qualities. At parts you will jump with fright, laugh at the classic humour and no doubt cry with real sympathy; this narf is just trying to get home to the blue world, which she came from through a porthole in the pool to send a message to all mankind but will she survive? The dog/wolflike scrunt hunts narfs while hiding in the grass and the tortutic hunts scrunts. Who will win in this epic adventure? Other actors/actresses include Bob Balaban, Jeffery Wright and Sarita Choudhury This is a film for puzzle lovers, the story twists and turns and confuses your brain and you sometimes end up not being sure what is going on. Then something unexpected happens and you end up being more confused or understanding it more. If you are simple-minded, this is not the film for you. However, the characters are fascinating, and the exciting storyline keeps you gripping on to the edge of your seat. James Newton Howard has composed a masterpiece soundtrack and set to fantastic, moving music, the film amazes you and you are never really sure what exactly is going on, but this just adds to the quality of the film. At a mere PG and only running for 110 minutes, anyone can watch it, and it is a film for the whole family to sit down and watch, do not be surprised if you have to pause, to ponder on exactly what is going on and you may have to watch it a few times to really understand the amazing work and plot of the story. The originality in the film is awesome; have you ever heard of a guy who only works out on one side of his body so the muscles on his arm are 4 inches bigger than the other arm? I did not think so, but M.Night.Shyamalan did. Compared to most films, this movie is packed full of all of the qualities that make a film great. To miss this would be unbelievable. A wonderful film for all ages; a family film or a late night film. Whoever you watch it with and whenever you watch it, the story is still the same; a magical journey and incredible film.",Lady in the Water
838,crimsonsmirk,Not for Everyone,7,11 September 2006,"Let me start off by saying that I completely understand why people might hate this movie. I will in no way say they don't have a point, because in truth, they do.Yes, the narrative is unconventional to a point where you *could* call it bad.Yes, a lot of elements *could* be considered ridiculous and too far out there even for a fantasy movie.Yes, there are cheesy moments of the Sailor Moon/Captain Planet kind.Yes, a lot of the characters are not defined to a high degree and some elements may be considered random/disjointed/....Yes, Shymalan is certainly not the best actor out there and casting himself as the writer of The Book that will ultimately change the world *could* be considered arrogance.... and so on...BUT This film's subtitle is ""A bedtime story"".And as lame and too simple an excuse as that may seem, it's the only excuse there is, and it's one that entirely redeems this film for me.""I want(ed) to believe!"" - an exclamation uttered a few times in the movie. For me it's pretty much the essence of the set of mind you have to be in when watching it. It's about leaving logic and one's precious common sense behind and just allowing the story to weave its web around you.In the end, Lady in the Water is a bedtime story. It radiates the feel of a parent making up something as they go along to their child's amusement and, possibly, education. It doesn't have to be perfect in every regard, planned through from one end to another, because that would go against this very unusual subgenre's premises.Likewise, the end isn't as final as one would expect... you always need a backdoor so that if your child insists on a sequel, you can go on in some way. The ideal bedtime story leaves you with a more or less finished story arc that, however, leaves enough room for your subconscious to create dreams about how it might continue.It's not the best movie in the world, but it is original, especially in the way it's structured, the way it works. The personalities may not be characterised like in some deep psychological drama, but seriously, when does that ever happen these days in the fantasy genre and who *wants* that to happen anyway? This bunch of oddballs is just another spice that makes this film interesting - my opinion anyway.So watch it if you're ready to abandon all those annoying limitations of adulthood. Stop questioning everything, accept, believe - and you might enjoy Lady in the Water as I did.Why only 7/10 then?

I liked trying to figure out who the people were that needed to help the Narf. It was fun. There were lots of twists, but it is not high adventure or thriller. I would say it was more a slow moving suspenseful mystery with lots of emotion and some commentary on movie critics. (He obviously has a lot of pet peeves about them, and prejudice against them).

I give him credit for his originality and creativity in ""The Sixth Sense"". However, that ""originality"" has been blow out of proportion and overused to the point where its just annoying.As is evident by his last two films, ""The Village"" and ""Lady in the Water"", he tries way too hard to be deep and it just comes out sounding ridiculous. The entire dialogue in ""The Village"" was hammy, overdone and just plain funny. I laughed every time William Hurt said anything in that movie.The ""imagination"" everyone keeps praising M. Night for in ""Lady in the Water"" is equally ridiculous. ""Lady in the Water"" was a well produced, poorly written, lame and unnecessary ""bedtime story"". His inclusion of himself as a main character made the movie even more humorous.M. Night is NOT a genius. He prides himself on his ""gorgeous camera shots"", his ""interesting dialogue"", and his ""creative twists"", all of which are overdone to the point of absurdity.

844,dvassilopoulos,"Beautifully made, hard to categorize.",7,30 October 2006,"As a Greek, I grew up with a lot of tales, myths and mythology. Our Ancient history is full of Nymphs, heroes, beasts and dream worlds. That is exactly why I dislike Hollywood. CGI cannot in any way create the atmosphere of a great fairy tale and a director paid millions of dollars is impossible to be a pure and undistracted story teller. It's just not working. Then Shyamalan came. He is definitely a talented man. His early work created great expectations. Afterwards all his movies seem to be a little bit out of pace. But this is only for those who love Hollywood. The man is actually a story teller and Lady in the Water it is his weakest movie because it is his strongest story. Putting the character of Harry Farber to talk so cynical about movies is a great, brilliantly made irony. He speaks straight to the viewers of the film telling them that ""this may not be in the Sixth sense level, it's definitely not Hitchcock, it's just a fairy tale. A bed-time story."" Forget about finding early clues to impress the beautiful girl sitting next to you. It is just a fairy tale simple as the shirt that Story wears but at the same time complicated and confusingly beautiful as Story's big blue eyes. Go and watch it just for the atmosphere and the simplicity of the art that hides. For this, hard to explain, feeling that escorts you as you going to the underground parking of the theater to your car. Definitely not a masterpiece. At least not yet. After all, History itself reveals that only those things that have been simple to its design and complex to its purpose shall be treated with respect by Time.

I believe only a certain type of person, certain genre if you will, can appreciate the movie. it has nothing to do with stereotypes, and i could not tell you what type of person would like this movie. i can only tell you how it touched me. (me, a 20yr old college student) i actually went to see it alone twice. This is a story, fairy book style. Its about a man who has lost everything. Instead of ploughing ahead and losing himself in his work, or dissapearing and becoming an aimless alcoholic, he starts a sort of new life for himself. A quiet life where he is always there to help people but gets little if any recognition for it. Though he has chosen a new path, he is lost. We meet various characters, and the beautiful thing about them is each has a unique quirk or two. These aren't people you would look at twice on the street, but how can we dismiss them or tell them they aren't important? And the irony lies in there, because in the end they are the key to the story. Ordinary man kind. Then story comes along and says some beautiful lines (that i cant find on the internet anywhere!!! argh!) She tells us that man thinks he is alone, but he isn't. We are all connected. That really touched me. We do all need to realize we are connected, each affecting one another. Here in the US we are so isolated and alienated at times. we drive alone to work, school. there is no sense of community. and in our depression (it hits us all at times) we feel alone. but we need to realize everyone feels the same way and we are universally connected on so many levels. my favorite part is when a man says i wanted to believe, i needed to believe, more than i knew (not a direct quote. like i said, cant find them) and THAT IS THE POINT We NEED hope. we NEED to believe there is something out there that could change for the better, something after all this crap, etc. doesn't matter what we believe in, but we need a belief that gives us hope and makes us carry on in the everyday (which they show everyday in a beautiful, simple light)so thats what i think. if you pay attention to the message, it is absolutely marvelous and moving. at least it gave me hope for that night and gave me something to believe in",Lady in the Water
847,endre-ajandi,The Graphic Novel of the Movies,8,4 November 2006,"The Lady in the Water is a nice movie. It has everything for everyone. Like the movies should have. Mr. Shyamalan it seems is looking for something new in storytelling. He was doing a good job with the Unbrakeable, and had a go on ""comic book movie"" again with this one. I really like the approach he has on storytelling. The rest of the comic book movies are always about characters trying out the newfound powers and developing to a real hero at the end of the screening. It's like reading the first issue of the comic book. Mr. Shyamalan develops characters fast and takes us on the road fast. He uses every narrative tool to show us the main streak of his idea. This is a love or hate kind of movie and that fact tells us that you have to use your braincells when watching. I gave it eight because it isn't his best work (yet) making the best ""movie graphic novel"". I wish him good luck with the next one, and a nice time a the movie theater to all who are going to watch it.",Lady in the Water

849,Class1,Just brilliant,10,21 November 2006,"The word ""fairy tale"" usually prevents me from watching a particular movie. But never be fooled by it though. What made this great was the way that the horror and mystery was combined with a fairy tale to give it a new meaning. I lived myself into the story and tried to figure out, just like Cleveland, whom and where they fit into the tale needed for the survival of a young woman. His quest begins when he mets this young woman and she explains her situation. Thinking it is an easy task, he agrees to help her, but a certain law changes everything and then things become more intense and complicated and more puzzles needs to be solved. In my opinion, this is a not to be missed movie. Do yourself a favor and watch it.",Lady in the Water
850,horsesense789,A beautiful film that everyone should see,9,24 November 2006,"I went to the theatre a little nervous, since scary movies aren't really my thing. I'd seen The Sixth Sense and The Village, and had been frightened, so of Course, going to see another M. Night movie made me a little apprehensive. But boy am I glad that I saw it! The storyline had a much deeper meaning that a lot of people missed because they took the film at face value. DON'T DO THAT WITH THIS FILM! Sit back and let your mind think about the underlying message that M. Night wrote in the story. If you see it then you'll probably be as moved as I was.The lighting, camera angles, and all around mechanics of this film were stunning, and truly exhibited M. Night's talent with the camera. Bryce Dallas Howard's character is an aquatic being and therefore mostly shown in tones of blue light, and whenever she's not, she seems as if she doesn't belong in the frame. It's very subtle, which shows what a genius Shyamalan really is. Who cares if he cast himself in a role much larger than his normal cameo, it was gutsy, yes, but not a bad decision at all. He proved that he has acting ability as well as directorial and screen writing skills.Overall i believe that this film was an amazing success, and anyone who decides to take the time and watch it properly, using their brains while sitting through it, will find it to be just as artful and beautiful as I do.",Lady in the Water
851,XHonest_IagoX,This is a great movie.,9,30 January 2007,"What movie lovers need to understand about Night is that his movies are above and beyond the ordinary in all senses of the word. His movies has progressed into worlds and scenarios which are intended to make you ask the question,""What if?'. LITW is a movie which tries to connect the mundane and the ordinary to the fantasy world. This idea is similar to his previous movie Unbreakable where Samuel Jackson's character implied that superheroes in comics are based off of real events in history only perhaps distorted somewhat. The beautiful thing about this movie is that it shows that even the most simple acts and the distant most people can be connected in ways never thought imagined. Night's messages can be interpreted in a number of different ways but in the end they are intended to be applied to life as we know it, or rather think we know it. Night dives into the realm of mystery and wonders, 'Maybe?'.",Lady in the Water

Nights conveys in his films? It would then seem that we have some very shallow critics out there, and only you the viewer should decide, but only if you watch with your heart.There is a message here in this one, won't go into his others, but it's delivered in this film in just a few lines.""We are diverse, we are all precious, we are all interconnected, we all matter."" Look past the issues that are always inherent when you try to put to film complex feelings, they will always be there. There is no perfect movie, so stop looking.

Paul Giamatti is phenomenal as Mr. Heeb. Bryce Dallas Howard shows us that she truly is Ron Howard's daughter.

Although the storyline was an interesting one, I felt that the interpretation of the storyline in this film wasn't interpreted well enough.The characters were of slight interest but there could have been more to them. Within the story line there could have been a few more twists to the story. I didn't find this film as thrilling as the first two films that were directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Unbreakable and Sixth Sense both had a really good plot and twists at the end which would make the over all film intriguing to watch for the viewers.All though with his past two films I don't feel they were as successful.",Lady in the Water

It has been worth the waiting I have seen this movie and think that it for me is one of the best movies in 2006. The way it was filmed and the music that was used in this film is remarkable. The story has as expected from Mr.Night always many different sides. Cant wait to see the next film from Mr.Night. A must see if you are a film lover as I am. I have no negative remarks for this film. I would consider getting the soundtrack although perhaps it is nicer to hear in the movie than to hear on my ipod on my way to work. I loved 6th sense and am of the impression that this movie is just as interesting.,Lady in the Water
856,cjbookworm,M. Night is Brilliant,10,19 December 2006,"With this movie there have been a lot of negative responses. This has also occurred with other Shyamalan movies, and I'm pretty sure I know why. Shyamalan's movies go beyond ""Okay, there's a villain, I'm a hero, get me my gun"". It takes deeper thinking, and some people never took the time to do that. If you just look on the surface, some of Shyamalan's movies might seem a little lacking, but delving deeper you find a hidden wealth of thought.Some people have said that the fairy tale story in ""Lady in the Water"" was lacking and not deeply developed, or that Shyamalan didn't take enough time to convince us of it. He wasn't supposed to. A major theme in the movie was thinking as a child, believing as a child, and simply accepting strange ideas as fact, like a child. Accepting that we will believe as a child, Shyamalan is then free to continue and weave the rest of his story.Shyamalan's giving himself a larger role in this movie than normal is not about self-indulgence. Comparing him to his character, he is saying that his movies carry important messages that he will deliver even if it means he gets hurt in the process by critics and others.As with so many of his other stories, the movie is not just about escaping a monster, but focuses on the social bounds and regulations that society has placed on us. To fully understand this movie you must look deeper than other movies require you to. If you want to understand what the message is in this and the other Shyamalan movies, you have to be prepared to think outside of the box that we have been placed in.This movie, if you follow what I have said above, is excellent. The lessons taught, as well as the story told, contribute to a film that is definitely worth the watching.",Lady in the Water

Before renting this movie, I couldn't find a single review by a critic that said anything good about this film. I have come to truly feel sorry for people that have lost the ability to simply enjoy an old fashioned fairy tale, or any other movie for that matter. It seems that if critics wrote words such as ""a wonderful, heart-warming tale, guaranteed to renew your spirit,"" they'd probably be ridiculed by the Film Critics Guild or whatever dark club they all belong to. Is it sappy in some places? Yes...but what's so wrong with sappy? Or heroic? Or full of strange but interesting twists? The same critics hated ""The Village."" I loved that movie also. I think the world is an unfair place where written words of an elite club convince would-be movie-goers to not frequent a certain film that they might otherwise tremendously enjoy. Rise up and resist! Go see this movie that the critics hate, but that you are sure to treasure.",Lady in the Water
858,laiuppa,A rare dog from M. night,3,25 December 2006,"I usually like off beat movies, and I am almost always willing to suspend a little disbelief to allow a story to get by the rough points and blossom. I gritted my teeth through the stilted dialogue during the romance scenes in the last 3 Star Wars, but I stuck with it because the special effects and action were pretty much the story. It took me two viewings to really enjoy the Big Lebowski and finally appreciate the laid back charms of the Dude. And I also have to say that I am a fan of M. Night's other films. I like the surprise twists, the unexpected endings. But when I watched the first few minutes of the film and the new-age Starbucks latte inspired cartoons popped up, complete with a full description of the story, I almost shut off the player.It reminded me of the theater showing of David Lynch's Dune, which I saw many years ago. Apparently afraid that Dune newbies would be completely lost, someone decided to hand out a booklet of terms. It seemed a complete abdication of responsibility by Lynch to tell a cohesive story, to capture and keep our attention, and not to let the narrative get lost in the details. One mitigating factor for Lynch's Dune was the amazingly complex alternate reality that couldn't easily be shoe horned into a 2 hour movie.Unfortunately, there is no mitigating excuse for the Lady in the Water. M. Night wrote AND directed the movie, so there is no one else to point the finger at. There is no complex world to explore, and the whole story occurs in the confines of a single apartment complex. Whether this was related to budget or plot I don't know, but regardless, somewhere in between writing and directing, he forgets to get out of the way and let the story tell itself. Within the first 2 minutes, almost everything you need to know about the movie is revealed to you in the goofy narrative I mentioned before. Then he repeatedly clubs us over the head with ridiculous dialogue and lazy plot devices. There was no real attempt to let the story reveal itself. It is almost as if he did not want to tell a twist at the end, so much so I think that he tells you everything up front. The lack of a twist at the ending may be just that - a twist on M. Night Shyamalan endings.That said, the story itself could still have been interesting, given a little more direction, a lot more character development, and some realism in people's reactions. Say, you are part of a magical mystery that's taking place in the pool area of our apartment complex. Uhhh....OK! I believe you, seems pretty plausible! Unfortunately, there is no life here, just message, and the message is, play by the rules or the three tree monkeys will get you. And by the end of this one, you wish they had dragged M. night away instead. Or maybe just traveled back in time and flung poo onto the script so no one could make a film out of it. Come to think of it....maybe that's what happened! Hopefully M. Naught will turn back into M. Night and give us a movie worth watching again soon. We miss him.",Lady in the Water

The movie is definitely scary and in a couple of places you may jump out of your seat. But, for the most part it is a touching look into ordinary people's lives in a very NOT ordinary situation. I found some of the scenes absolutely hilarious. A great mixture of laughing, tears, sensitivity and terror.The surrealism of the setting along with the swimming pool and the sprinklers is really fun.Be sure not to miss the special features on the DVD. It is really interesting how the story began as a Dad's bedtime story (in real life - M. Night Shyamalan) and also the development and creation of the creatures.Pay attention to each apartment's dweller's surroundings. Who is watching what on T.V., decorations and furniture.I let my children (8 and 10) watch it. There is no bad language, sex, or inappropriate behavior (other then some people drunk).

So sad that there must be blood, guts, or things blowing up for people to like a movie. Perhaps watch it with a open mind and give it another try. It is a fantasy film and I don't think it was toted as such in the previews. M.

I am sorry that not everyone has liked them but, I think he does a brilliant job with writing, directing, and acting. ""Lady"" was a great movie. Shyamalan did not disappoint us with any aspect of the movie. I love how you try to guess at who's doing what or as in ""Lady"" which of the tenants would play the roles that she needed. I also like that he takes a person (or two) from his previous movie and has them in the next one. The whole movie was different from what I expected. When previews of his movies come out, they usually look a bit scary. And they are a little bit. I am glad they are not filled with gore and blood and all kinds of profane language. A suspense movie does not need that. These are like ""starter"" suspense or scary movies that I could show my kids. I am thankful for that. M.

I had a hard time relating to the actions or reactions of any of the characters. They seemed very illogical and unrealistic, further enhancing the unbelievability of the whole story. At no point in the film did anyone question the ""I have a nymph in my apartment, she needs you to help her"" line.The plot could have been good, if time and energy had been placed into developing the realness of the characters, the complexity of their lives and situations.

And so great that I'm loosing interest in almost every other movie I see out there.""Lady in the Water"" drew me in and held my heart even after it was over. All I can say is: ""WOW"". But I'll try to say more. ""Lady..."", like the rest of Night's movies, are beautifully paced. He draws his viewers in so that we may... fall in love with the characters, wonder what will happen next, and gasp when he reveals the genius of this plot turns. I also appreciate that Night doesn't compromise his movies with swearing and sex/nudity. ""Lady..."" meshes reality with fantasy to a level that can be appreciated by adults who have that feeling of ""pins & needles""; it's not just a children's bedtime story.

For what is basically a far-fetched children's bedtime story, it takes itself quite seriously and holds up very well against many other larger-budgeted films in the genre.

I hope that no one has been eagerly awaiting it's release, because if you have you will be disappointed as all hell!Basically, this movie had bad acting, an awful, unbelievable storyline, and it seemed to be improvised as the actors went along.The director himself has a main role in the film. He should have stuck to just directing. Acting is not one of his talents, and after seeing this film, his talent for movie-making is going bye-bye as well. The cast is full of nobody's except Paul Giamatti and a very tiny role which stars Bob Balaban, who played the NBC boss, Russell Dalrymple, on episodes of Seinfield. The other actors are either annoying or just plain bad at acting and very unconvincing. Sometimes it seems that they are reading their lines off cue cards instead of from memory, like they should be doing. Some of the characters are also very stereotyped.Do not even get me started on the plot! It opens with this asinine story about people in the sea communicating to humans, complete with narration over badly drawn stick figures. The story becomes increasingly ridiculous and unbelievable throughout, and it seems too much at times. People would just not take to the situations presented in this film so willingly as is shown. It just becomes a confusing mishmash of strong coincidence and unrealistic crap.There is no really scary parts except when the odd loud bang comes in.There is a scene that sums up the entire movie which starts with a viewpoint from behind some leaves of a bush on the ground with terrifying music playing in the background, cut to a man with one large, muscled arm holding a broom to fight a grass-dog.There is just too much to say about this film but I would have to give things away to say them. I have never seen a worse film and I have seen Troll 2...I even own it. At least Troll 2 is funny because it is so awful. Lady in the Water is not even funny because it is awful, it is just awful.

882,moose473,exciting adventure,10,17 February 2007,"I, personally enjoyed this film very much. Although, many people I've talked to about Lady in the Water do not like it, it was interesting enough to keep my attention. I thought it had a good plot, although unrealistic, it takes the audience on an exciting adventure that will you keep you interested/guessing until the very end, which is a satisfying ending by the way. This movie gave my imagination a great work out. I mean, it's not everyday that you find a character (Story) from a bedtime story in an apartment swimming pool. The quest to protect Story and help her return home safely proves to be an difficult task for Cleveland Heep (and other apartment tenants), and great entertainment for the audience. Lady in the Water is in a category by itself. It is different from most movies you will come across and Shyamalan does a great job of making the audience question the mundane and ask ""what if?.."". The characters were portrayed perfectly. I think with this movie, people either love it or they hate it. . but you should at least watch it and find out for yourself!! It's great!",Lady in the Water

Nights work so far, so after 'Lady in the water' came out on DVD in Germany, I thought this would sort of guarantee two hours of solid entertainment....but: I wasted money on the rental of the DVD. After 45 mins into the 'story' of this blatant failure, we switched it off, realizing that we had just been ripped off by another Hollywood marketing trick. The story of the movie is boring and ridiculous. It's ridiculousness even evolves and turns into madness to fake something like fantasy. It does not contain any plot line logic and the 'special effects' were made by crazy morons with an Atari ST. This stripe is a disgrace.

I kept waiting or something good to happen, but nothing ever did. I thought my head was going to explode after watching it. I have never seen anything so bad in my life. The characters are called narfs and scrunts, which is lame enough. But they didn't have to have a little kid reading prophecies off of cereal boxes. If there was any effort to make a serious movie here, I certainly couldn't see it. If it was supposed to be a mockery of fairy tales, then that makes this even worse. Soul Power.",Lady in the Water
885,ppickard123,Going beyond the daily routine,6,18 March 2007,"(This contains spoilers) Cleveland (Paul Giamatti), the manager of an apartment discovers a true fairytale creature who made a home in the pool. This creature, also known as a Narf, was there to inspire one person to greatness. The theme of the movie shows that people have the ability to step outside of their normal lives to help someone in trouble, no matter how weird the situation may seem.There are many scenes that support this theme; towards the beginning of the movie, Cleveland (Paul Giamatti) ends his normal routine to help Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), a sea narf, get home safely. Cleveland goes in search of what Narf means. All the information he learns is based on a fairytale provided by an oriental woman who lives in his building. Based on this information, Cleveland searches for the individuals within the apartment building who can help get the narf home. (Chapter 6, track 2130) These special people are known as the Symbolist, a Guardian, and a Guild. (Chapter 15) These people do not know of the role they must play nor of their special gifts.Cleveland reaches out to several individuals who seem to fit these roles. Once again, without questions, these people show up to help Story. If we take a look at the shower scene where everyone is together, you'll see Story sitting in the shower, the Symbolist, a Guardian, the Healer, and a Guild. I believe this shows the willingness of these people to help. However, I believe the director is trying to show us through this scene that they are not on the right track. Notice the shower curtain separating everyone; possibly meaning there is a disconnection. Also, take a look at the walls outside the bathroom; they are yellow and the curtain is in red; this could mean they need to be cautious and that they are in danger. These individuals are risking their safety and possibly their lives for this person they have just met.In the healing scene where we have the true Guild and Healer together and laying hands on Story, the high-key lighting, the Guild in pink could symbolize hope. This to supports the theme, because these individuals are being asked to perform a ritual of healing that they have never done before.Certain people within this group determine they are not the ones ordained to help, but even with this knowledge they continue to help. (Chapter 21) Right before the Eagle finds Story, everyone is holding a weapon trying to guard Story. This is another good example of people helping others in dire situations.The Lady in the Water's theme is somewhat similar to another one of M. Night Shyamalan's films, The Sixth Sense, staring Bruce Willis. Both films focus on a supernatural event and a person's willingness to help resolve a problem no matter how unusual it may be. Dr. Malcolm Crowe,(Bruce Willis) a child psychologist helps a young boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment). Cole has a problem with seeing dead people. In the scene where Dr. Crowe realizing the boy may really be able to see dead people, he takes a leap of faith and continues to work with Cole.In both movies the viewer is kept guessing as to how it was going to end.The director, M. Night Shymalan, utilizes the plot very well. The storyline shows how people have the ability to go out of their way to help others.",Lady in the Water

Paul Giamatti made a great performance, along with Bryce Dallas Howard who was perfect for her character role. M. Night Shyamalan did great writing and directing on the film, and I can't see why he would get two Razzie Awards for Worst Director and Supporting Actor, he was great! It was well written, the cinematography was unbelievable, I don't think a lot of people get the story line of it. I understood it perfectly and I think people who didn't get, they should at least try and watch the film again so they can get a heavier look on how it was well made.

We all know this is a fantasy film, so why even try to make sense of the movie? I read so many reviews saying the film is illogical and all that, come on guys, you need to loosen up.This movie is original, and Shyamalan has once again shown that he's creative and has a wonderful mind. Unfortunately for him, too many people out there have dead brains and sad childhoods, leaving them with no imagination at all. I also sense jealousy in some reviews even. The characters in the movie were well played, and Shyamalan's acting is not bad too! I think acting in your own film is an interesting thing to do, and I am not sure why people object to that.Good movie, I say again, simple and enjoyable.",Lady in the Water
889,taharat71,Absolute garbage.,2,9 December 2013,"Lady in the Water is by far, Shyamalan's worst movie! It's mainly because of a very poor script, that failed to make any bit of sense from the start to the beginning.There isn't a single thing likable about any of the characters in the film, even the brilliant Paul Giamatti couldn't shine in his role ! Some people have reviewed the story of this film as unique. Yes, it's unique in the sense that the storyline is the most contrived piece rubbish ever written. Last but not least, M.Night's acting in this movie is just beyond pathetic. I couldn't stop laughing every time he came on screen !",Lady in the Water
890,bmgreen,Fairy Tale of Hope,9,22 July 2006,"I had read several reviews of Lady in Water before I saw it Friday night. I usually ignore more reviews I read anyway. The movie I saw was nothing like I the one I read about in the reviews.This movie was excellent. If you don't go with the expectation that it is a certain type of film (suspense film noir, etc.)I think you will enjoy it. I think most professional movie critics are idiots.The movie is as M.N. says a ""bedtime story"" or fairy tale. It is supposed to be a fantasy, have mythic qualities, but still have a message--and it does.This is an entertaining film. A engaging story, humor, characters your can relate to, Heep and Story, and-oh my god, I know this is difficult for movie critics--makes you think! I think the problem with the film (from the movie critic perspective) is it is not predictable, it is not formulaic, either the formula they want M.N. to follow, or some other director's formula. Hello, it is a fantasy! The movie critics actually have to stay and watch the whole film and maybe even think about it afterwards for a couple of hours before they can start writing their review.I think M.N. is much too subtle for the movie critics. While a movie like F.9/11 is in your face with it's message, Lady in the Water has more of a traditional allegorical message. This is a story about being able to have hope in a time of war. Of people coming together that barely know each other and helping each other with a common cause. Of people who may be from different backgrounds/ethnicities (e.g., immigration ban)seeing the good and possibility in each other and working together to help someone & a cause in need. This story's message is that there *is* still hope for humanity if we only *listen* to each other and *listen* to the messengers that are sent to guide and redeem us.But then a movie has to have all the subtlety of ""Crash"" to win an academy award...(sarcasm intended)I admit, I am a big fan. Unlike many people, I think The Village was brilliant. THis is not quite as good, but then again it is a different film and he was trying to do something different with this. But the reviews have been much too harsh-go see it for yourself.",Lady in the Water

I ask myself, is it really that wrong to get a refund for a free movie that was this terrible. If there was a way to get a refund for something free, I would demand it. I feel cheated and it cost me nothing. I have lost roughly 2 hours of my life to this film. Time I could have spent staring off into space and would have been more entertained. I cannot stress that this movie has no redeeming qualities. The acting is horrible, the plot has no flow. There is never a moment where you feel you have witnessed a horrible events.

Many of the good reviews of this film are hopeful, well-written /articulate and seem refined...hmmm...this appears to go beyond simple fan-devotion.I suspected that a lot of these ""user-reviews"" were fake padding put up by internet-oriented publicity companies paid by whomever to at least get people interested enough to buy or rent this movie (ie spend money on it). Interestingly, it seemed like every fanboy-reviewer that I clicked on had reviewed this movie and only this movie despite many of them claiming to be devoted M. Knight Shammy fans...not damning evidence, but curious none the less.This is also my only review, but I intend to comment more on this greedy manipulation/fraud that is taking place on the net.PS: I thought Unbreakable was great, very unique, but what's with the ""M"" in your name, Shamz?

I was shocked that the ""big reveal"" actually happens at the beginning of this movie, where the shocker was always at the end in the previous movies (and as is normally the case in Hollywood). I was disappointed. But then, the movie grew on me. I found myself rooting for the characters, feeling their emotions, laughing and being afraid at the same time. This movie moved me like few others have. If you *only* want movies like Star Trek, the Matrix, Fast & Furious, etc., then stay away. But if you can appreciate different types of movies, and can appreciate the artistic qualities of movies and the cerebral aspects, and can actually use slower parts to think through the events (as the characters are), then you very well may love this.I've seen this movie a half a dozen times, and I love it.",Lady in the Water

But really the subtle message is very uplifting. Even when it does not seem so, even when you think you are ordinary and that everyone around you looks ordinary, maybe, just maybe, there is more behind what things and people seem to be.

The vitriol that critics spew on this sweet, hopeful story is surprising, but in some cosmic way it is balanced by the intense affection its fans feel compelled to communicate. (This is my first IMDb review - a result of this obligation).I walked out of the theater with a new sense of wonder at the world - the direct result of the fantastic world-on-earth that Shymalan created in Lady. While I agree that, oftentimes, there was more tell than show and the movie required the suspension of much disbelief, its function as a modern myth mitigated these potential detractions. Are we really too cynical to even IMAGINE how the presence of the fantastic, with the world teetering in the balance, might affect our mundane lives? Isn't that the point of a fantasy story - to imagine? This film is original on so many levels - the story, the characters, the camera angles - often to a breathtaking degree. And all the furor around the ""quality"" of the film only serves as a testament to Shymalan - he got people heated up and talking, the mark of an artist.",Lady in the Water

At times, the girl could not speak, and at other times, she was speaking as well as a news anchor on the walkie-talkie with the male lead actor. That really did not make any sense, and in other parts of the movie, she needed someone to interpret her signs, because she could not speak apparently. It was worse than watching the boom guy lower the microphone in the scene each time. Really really bad directing and the most unbelievable non-existent plot ever. I am usually not compelled to write a bad review of a movie, since I figure everyone should have their own opinion. However, in this case, I feel more compelled to warn people to not spend even a dollar on either renting this film or wasting the almost two hours watching it on HBO.

The characters were made of humorous, sad, lazy, troubled and so on, but really they were portrayed as human as any of us. There are themes of redemption which run just like any fairytale but the characters are just like people we know or have come across. They all had some role to play even if it seemed that the story changed their calculable roles during its course. The healing themes highlight 'New Age' ideas but offer only hope which is all anyone can offer another. The analytical mind does not always see the whole picture as in the films 'writer' character who is attacked.

It isn't going to meet expectations for conventional story, plot, or characterization.Instead, this is a movie of ideas, and ultimately, hope. Sometimes, movies that deal in the abstract, with supernatural themes and characters, venture into such outlandish fantasy that it's hard to keep up, or difficult to see the ""message"" through the metaphor. Not this film. It kept me with it from opening to final frames, and also, rare for a summer movie, made me feel things along the way.It's tempting to advise people to go into this movie as a child hearing a bedtime story. (Even the poster advertises it as a bedtime story.) But the risk would be that people would prejudge it as childish. There's a big difference between childlike and childish, though. A childlike approach let's you check your reasoning at the door and be caught up in a good story. A childlike approach let's you have some hope. I guess that's what left me liking this film so much.

902,Tobyrella,A Journey of Self-Discovery,9,9 November 2009,"Okay, so when I first received this film as a birthday present I felt slightly let down. The cover looked boring, the blurb even worse and compared to all of M.Night's other films, a bit of a one off. My sister one day asked me to watch it with her and so I did, just to give it a chance. I so regret now not watching it earlier! The story is consequently of a creature called 'Story' except, we learn more about the main character, the janitor, than anyone else. I, personally, believe that it is the story of self-discovery, how someone so unknown and ignored can achieve so much with the right people and M.Night has shown this on a backdrop of a simple fairytale, which I think was done especially effectively.The actors fit their parts well and I love how it is comic at times and even though it stereotypes a few, I think i is good how it shows all aspects of modern society and things we can relate to e.g. the stuck-up film critic and the cat-lady. M.Night also plays a role in the film, which I neither agree nor disagree with- he plays the part well and it's his film and if I made a film, I too would love to play a part.The score is immense- I have never been touched by music before this film and I didn't think twice about buying the soundtrack- it is unforgettable and certainly not one to miss. I have learnt that the composer, James Newton Howard,has actually worked with M. Night on nearly all his films if not all. He makes the film come alive.This is definitely a Marmite film- you either love it or you hate it but my advice is watch it.

All the characters are entertaining. I was on the edge of my seat wondering how the mystery would play out! Ebert comments on some of the creatures in the movie, ""monkeys with Mohawks"" he calls one of them, although this is an accurate description I did not find them silly at all. Tree Beard in Lord of the Rings was pretty weird looking! What about all the Star Trek characters? Why aren't we mocking them? Just because the monkeys with Mohawks are out of a scifi/fantasy context why should we mock them? Oh wait this IS a fantasy, it's a fairy tale!

I do not base my reviews on any one's opinion but my own. Most people seem to be attacking M.

In fact, the reviewer gave a seemingly positive review of the movie, but in the end, gave it a C minus.This movie is not a thriller, it is not full of action. It is an honest tale.

In the ""Lady in the water"", the audience is transported in to make believe world of a fairy tale being enacted in a contemporary Los Angeles apartment. The central character of the movie is played by Paul Giamatti (who delivers a fine performance) who has a tragic past and struggling to come to terms with it. Much of the movie is about rediscovering his purpose again for a man battling against his torments of his past and coming to grips with it. As with a typical Night Shyamalan film, the central theme of the film is not what it seems it is and every scene has a hidden purpose and a meaning, a parallel plot runs beneath it and the audience is encourage to imagine, explore and find it out. This surely has to be one of Night Shyamalans best work and one of the best movies of the year. Don't listen to the critics; it is clear from their attitude and failure to understand this movie that it does not require much intellect or education to be a critic these days.

Not only do the trailers lead you one way, but his films themselves are never what they seem. The trailers for Lady in the Water seem to portray the film as horror. However, while there are great moments of suspense and some genuine ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" startles. This is definitely not a horror film. With that being said... this is an incredibly brilliant film with a tremendously engaging story, superb acting from the cast, particularly Giamatti, and Shyamalan's trademark stellar direction. People seem to get upset with Shyamalan because they go in expecting one thing and getting something else. The Village is the perfect example. People were hoping for this horror creature style movie, but ended up with something completely different. I like that. I enjoy having to think a little bit at the movies. Don't just tell me everything in the trailer. Use the trailer to get me interested and then surprise me. Shyamalan has done that with excellence here with Lady in the Water. Do go in expecting The Ring or any of the other formulaic scare pictures Hollywood has been churning out lately. Go see Lady in the Water because it is a remarkable film with a great story, fine acting and incredible originality.",Lady in the Water

I haven't seen a movie quite like it before. If you like fantasy bent heavily towards mystery and magic then you'll love this movie.There are perhaps moments you'll have to overlook to keep the magical energy flowing but if you keep an open mind you should have a wonderful experience.This is quite possibly the most emotional movie i've witnessed to date, sharpened delicately with the help of the stunningly drippy score from James Newton Howard.I know I have overdone it with the adjectives but I can't praise this movie highly enough.",Lady in the Water
909,hondareport,Review: Lady in the Water,8,26 July 2006,"http://www.hondareport.com/free/archives/000587.htmlThe only way to enjoy this film is to listen to it as a child would. That may be the biggest reason  along with the writer's outright brutal treatment of a character who is a film critic  why this movie will likely be hated by reviewers eternally. Me? Loved it. 3 stars (out of 4).By Paul Honda Editor, hondareport.com July 25, 2006There will be the usual silly uproar from the bleachers, so to speak.This is no Sixth Sense. Not Unbreakable. No Signs for a rebound. In fact, the boo-birds may be signing M. Night Shyamalan off as a has-been, fluke or even a whimsical, bloated egocentric wanna-be who simply forgot how to churn out a blockbuster.Truth is, if Lady in the Water had been made by an unknown foreign indie director-writer, we would be singing his (or her) praises to the high heavens. I haven't read a single review, at least not in detail, of Lady, which was released on Friday. I went into the viewing with the expectation of a fable, a bedtime story, which is what Shyamalan drew upon for this film: a creation of his own for his two young daughters.I'm not going to spill details as I usually do in film reviews. But I will say this: the mythological proportions of his story are never subtle, and he does miss with a mighty swing on more than one occasion. M. Night's writing goes that way, a slugger with a prodigious home run swing and plenty of strikeouts to show for it.In this case, the loopy humor, one-dimensional second-tier characters and fast-forward method of tale-telling are too obvious to criticize. Only someone expecting something other than a bedtime story would expect more in this scenario.He does himself no favors with the way the (new) resident in Apartment 13B is portrayed. Shyamalan's blunt disdain for film critics is way over the top in this character, and is one of the flaws of this flick. But honestly, it didn't bother me from an entertainment perspective. As a storyteller, though, I would've wanted more subtlety in the way the critic was handled.This certainly wasn't just about flaws or critics, of course. Bryce Howard is seamless as the Lady, provocative and innocent, vulnerable and alluring. Paul Giamatti was perfectly cast for this role, over the top as a stifled, conscientious building super. The relationship between Howard and Giamatti makes this film work for me, and that's all I'll tell.The marketing of this film was a bit mundane and head-scratching, using a child's voice to narrate the trailers from beginning all the way to ""Opens July 22."" But in hindsight, it wasn't a bad idea, especially considering the fact that Shyamalan views this film as appropriate for most kids over 10. It was his giveaway to the fact that this wasn't a true thriller or horror flick. This was an homage to every story heard from India to Indiana about good versus evil, a reluctant vehicle for heroism who could be any of us, or any supernatural being who has oh, so human fears and vulnerabilities.Are they around us, much closer than we ever imagine? If M. Night has his way, they're right next to us, and his courage to tell such a simple, endearing tale is worth half the battle. Whether you like this film (or hate it) depends a lot on how easily you suspend your grip on reality to see through to simple virtues, just as child would.In a world of severe injustice, it bears worth remembering that even in words of the most supernatural, common folks are asked to adopt the mindset of a child in order to believe. Reason is imperative in the world of crusty, middle-aged movie reviewers. They work on deadline, have bills to pay and peer pressure to yield to the masses. Watching a film, or hearing a story the way a child would? It's beneath them, most of them anyway.If myth has a way with us, we will believe, and more importantly, we will continue to hope. The boo-birds in the bleachers will fade into the background, white noise in the night.Rating: 3 stars (out of 4)",Lady in the Water
910,Stephj329,Slow pace but powerful message,7,4 January 2007,"If you can wait out the slow pacing of the beginning of the movie, the scene where the narf tells M. Night about his future is worth the whole movie. ""You will write a book that a boy will grow up with (in his home, the ideas discussed and accepted). It will plant the seeds of change and influence him-he will become a leader and change the world."" The idea that however insignificant you feel now, something that you do will effect millions in the future even via violent change was well put. I was a bit annoyed at the spoon feeding through the dialogue. I wish more directors would/could convey their story visually instead of someone reading us the story on camera? Give us the opportunity to figure it out and understand instead of showing us everything? He did that in the Sixth Sense. He has great ideas, just needs to be a little harder on himself I think.",Lady in the Water
911,Jesse_Ofner,Great movie and very good story telling,8,24 July 2006,"Depending upon your view of reality and plausibility you may or may not like this movie. However, if your like me and love just being told a great story then you will love this movie.Forget for a second that you are watching movie and remember what it was like before you were cynical before everything needs to be commoditized and made simple and easy. do that then go watch this movie. if there was ever a time when I needed a good story it was now. With all the things that are going on in the world it's nice to see a movie that doesn't try to pretend to be anything else. this is a story with a message that is very simple and also complex.I also just loved the idea that someone takes a break from trying to scare with sensationalism or grossation. He makes you laugh to diffuse the intensity and to keep you moving with the story. An earlier review said that he didn't know if they were supposed to laugh. I believe that his movies are supposed to bring the audience through an emotional ride and humor is important to him. I also think that if your watching a movie for no other reason than to try to understand the directors vision than you are not getting anything out of the movie. I think a movie should first entertain then effect the audience. this movie does both and if you watch it to be entertained you will and then after that once it starts to sink it you will be effected.I think he keeps the main messages in his movie really close and dosen't disguise them to much with symbolism. Symbollism is important and the idea's in the movie however it's not important to understand them while watching the movie. understanding the symbols and metaphors is always for afterword and is of course subject to interpretation.Lady has a lot of things to it but m. has a lot to say I think. In the end each person has to see it for what they see it. I loved it and thought it as good as he has done before and better than what other people are doing.go watch this movie...be entertained and then think about it and I believe you will be presently surprised.",Lady in the Water
912,dmfreck,"A brilliant work of art, in context...",9,24 July 2006,"I love Shyamalan's films, and while I thought this flick was far superior to his last effort, The Village, I walked away from the theater still a bit disappointed...the story seemed somewhat thrown together and a bit lacking in focus, and while I won't argue that it's not still flawed in some ways, I think I finally *got* the movie today after reflecting a bit more: We all know that this was supposed to be some kind of bedtime story that Shyamalan told his girls, but what I didn't get was this is *exactly* how the story was doled out to us in the movie, itself: Heep kept returning and returning (and returning) to a tenant in his apartment complex to get more and more of the story/myth, laboriously so, I thought at first...but then I realized that this is what parents do when they're making up a bedtime story...they dole it out in bits and pieces, sometimes even changing things as they go along since they forgot or had to amend part of the story to fit their next part...(Were you frustrated when Heep kept returning to the Korean lady over and over for more of the story/myth?) It all makes sense in this light.I won't argue whether or not it's an effective story-telling method for this medium, but I think the movie gained a couple of stars in my book after thinking of it in these terms. I really believe, as a whole, this was exactly what Shyamalan was after...Giamatti/the audience was being told a bedtime story. It's a story within a story, but in the genre of a make-believe story a parent might conjure up and parcel out each night to his/her kids.One of the movie posters for LitW reads ""A Bedtime Story"" at the very top. It's a bedtime story...and not just for his kids, but for Heep and very much us as well. This is a bedtime story come to film.",Lady in the Water
913,apollon-1,Hideous,1,26 December 2006,"Won't even cut it as a flick for the little ones; awful production, shameful acting, just stay away - don't waste your time. I'm sorry I did. The plot is hanging by a strand in the best of times, most of the time it balances between ridiculous and downright stupid. The special effects are all but special. The soundtrack, absolutely cheesy -- add that to an appalling sound production. The myth elements are ridiculous. The lines are often barely audible, but that might be a plus. Photography is ... poor. The last few minutes found me rolling eyes and staring at every other possible direction except for the screen.

914,Krepusko99,I want to punch Shyamalan in the face.,2,17 August 2006,"How is it that the film isn't simply, ""Lady in the Water,"" but ""M. Night Shymalan's Lady in the Water?"" Could it be because our acclaimed director is a pretentious, self-indulgent hack with the aesthetic sensibilities of a 16 year old fantasy nerd? Every one of his pictures (with the notable exception of Unbreakable--which was actually good, as he did not write it) has some grandiose, mind-bending twist that no one is supposed to anticipate. Leading to the revelation of the twist is a series of awkwardly emphasized clues that the not so clever audience is supposed to store unconsciously, and at the correct, climactic moment, assemble to sufficiently realize the genius of what it just experienced. For the reasonably intelligent viewer, however, these ""clues"" are insultingly obvious, pedantic and incongruous. One of the most infuriating aspects of this film is the fact that Shyamalan himself portrays the man who will one day write the brilliant political treatise that will come to change the world, and compel people to love one another. What kind of an asshole writes such a role for himself? Another thing that annoyed me is the monologue delivered by the cynical critic's character before he died. His verbally putting faith in the reliability of tried cinematic clichés to save his life, only to have them ripped to pieces a moment after is supposed to demonstrate for us how Shyamalan is single-handedly destroying the artistic barriers of film norms and narrative conventions. Wow! What a douche bag... What an amazing douche bag. I would like to punch him in the face and demand some recompense for the 6 hours wasted (or however painfully long it was) of my life.",Lady in the Water
915,theblackfedora,A story about Stories.,10,23 July 2006,"The lest said about the plot of the film the better. Not because it's bad because it's an imaginative one, and you should really go in having no idea what you're in store for. That's part of the point of the movie.The introduction of this movie is done in cave drawings. It's a fitting opening and a good clue that this movie is about stories. No, not modern film, which many critics and audiences today think is about pushing boundaries and constantly doing something 'new'. This movie is about the good old fashioned story. The reason why our ancient ancestors sat around fires and told them, and their ability to inspire and save souls.There isn't anything truly new about it (it has roots in the classic fairy tales and epic poems of antiquity), other than the fact that it dares to be a great film made in the mondern era in spite of being littered with elements of the now despised classical story (which apparently isn't good enough for modern film makers anymore).The thing about these classic stories and the one that Shaymalan is attempting to tell is that they have a purpose, and strive to inspire society and humanity as a whole. They lead people to do great things, and make us all feel better in the end, where most modern 'stories' feel more like egotistical attempts of ""artists"" to make themselves feel great and leave us in awe of their great greatness.Christopher Doyle lends some excellent shots to this film, which some how manage to make a scene of an every day loser frigthenedly warding off a were-wolf type monster with a pool skimmer seem exceptionally epic. At the same time it helps the story (for me at least) pull those same strings that great stories like Gilgamesh, and the Aeneid pull.I saw this film the day it opened and I was delighted. I came home, as is my habit, and read all the reviews. A good section of this movie is directed at attacking assanine, jaded, film critics who think their opinions are authoratitive (it depicts them as being the ruiners of the classic story), and so, all of the assanine, jaded, and authoratative film critics seem to have panned it.No one seemed really sure what the movie was about, but were all quick to pan M. Night as being arrogant for casting himself in the role of a writer destined to change the world. They, ironically, claim that he was being arrogant, completing unable to fathom that their own presumptions about why he cast himself in that role could in fact be a good deal more arrogant...I'll have to admit that I've been the jaded film critic before, but one I came out of this one I remembered why I've always loved stories, and why they don't' always have to be new and fit into some silly sense of ""reality"".",Lady in the Water
916,rugbygrrrl,WOW - I didn't expect to love this film,10,8 January 2007,"I almost didn't see this film because of all the negative comments and lukewarm reviews but I am REALLY glad that I did. I actually found myself watching all of the DVD extras and replaying the ending several times because I just didn't want it to be over. I laughed, I cried - it was a great yarn, expertly told.I loved the story and I am sad that the film didn't get more of a positive response when it was in the theater - I actually wish I'd seen it on the big screen in order to really experience all of the very fine cinematography. I think, because it's a bedtime story that the director made up for his children, you have to utilize the ""willing suspension of disbelief"" - really let yourself be a bit of a kid again and enjoy the story unfolding. I thought that Paul Giamatti and the other actors were perfect and there were several stories-within-stories and bits of humor that really added a lot to the fabric of the film.",Lady in the Water
917,singinblues26,"Good film, stop criticizing it so harshly.",8,28 January 2007,"I was told not to watch this film by many people and so, I passed it by the first time around. Recently, I was told by other people (who have good tastes in films) that I should give it a chance, that it wasn't fantastic, but it was worth a watch because it was original and creative.Everyone has such high expectations for Shyamalan's work after the huge debut success of Sixth Sense, and I think that is unfair. The Sixth Sense was amazing, but just because it was his most successful film to date doesn't mean that all of his subsequent films should be just as amazing.Lady in the Water was an entertaining film and an extremely creative story to tell. It may not have had the huge twists everyone expects from a Shyamalan film, but it had many little twists that kept the story fresh and moving along. It was like an ornate puzzle that both we and the characters had to figure out, and discovering which characters took on what roles in the story (Guardian, Guild, Healer, Interpreter) was fun and exciting.It also had a message that was touching and inspiring, and the storyline with M. Night's role was interesting and touching. Everyone wants to change the world, and in small ways everyone does. Lady in the Water was like a fun fairy tale for adults, but most of the adults who saw it wished it were more sophisticated (like the Sixth Sense!).Take it for what it is, a fun film with more to offer than big star names and a huge shocking twist at the end. That kind of success only comes once, and after such success, Shyamalan is only doing what he knows, and I applaud him for it.",Lady in the Water
918,renegadeclownn,Don't like the genre labels mislead you.,7,26 July 2006,"I was very skeptical about buying a ticket to see another M. Night movie... I liked the Village better than most people, but still thought it was definitely lacking, so I wasn't sure what to expect from his newest film. Finally I decided to watch it, and found it to be a surprisingly entertaining movie! The story presented to us isn't a horror movie, it isn't a psychological thriller, it isn't even a mystery. It's just a nice story, with some good moments and laughs and interesting characters. That being said, it's important to note that Paul Giamatti held this movie together. I especially liked some of the supporting characters, but they would have been out of place without a strong lead. Without him the story (which being a fantasy is already slightly unbelievable) would not have been accepted by the audience. The plot could have had Easter Bunny fall from the sky and steal all the chocolate in the world, but somehow that would have been okay as long as we got to see the stuttering Heap's reactions and emotions.Bottom line: don't sit down to watch this movie with any prejudices or previous expectations. Sit down, and watch each minute as it passes. It may not be what you thought it would be, and some people may be disappointed by that. However, this movie is genuinely entertaining, and I challenge anyone to watch it without smiling at least once.",Lady in the Water
919,WayneJSheppard,"Lady in the Water, a profound message beyond a bedtime story",10,30 July 2006,"This film is as valuable for these times as Close Rncounters and ET were for previous generations. This film in itself is a seed for action and hope in a world greatly suffering. Never underestimate the profound power of expression through film. This film, Lady in the Water is added substance to the growth of the word wide movement for positive change that cannot be stopped by negative forces. It touches a common heartfelt place in all but only the most hardened consciousness. It addresses our own doubts and fears that we allow ourselves to cower to too often. M. Night Shyamalon shares with us his wonderful hope for the future of people and life on this planet. As usual this goes so far beyond merely a fantasy film or children's bed time story.",Lady in the Water
920,crooked_starr,"From such a creative director, ""Lady"" is uncreative, lacking",4,22 July 2006,"Shymalan is director notorious for creating imaginative movies that inject fantasy into the everyday. Lady in the Water however lacks that magic. All the fantastic elements of this movie can be captured withing a minutes. All else is very everyday and normal. It feels like watching a bunch of adults play make-believe. This was so much so that the audience was laughing at parts that weren't intended to be comedic. Even the fantasy elements of this movie that do shine through are not very innovative or special. The creatures that appear do not have very unique designs; they are just animals. Events that happen are not something that audiences haven't seen already. Overall, the story and ideas intended are unique, wonderful, a great bedtime story. The main actors do their best to bring the story to life (except for Shymalan--he really should've just gotten another actor to play his part). But this story looks so much better on paper than on the screen.",Lady in the Water
921,Wanna_be_critic,Fails to live up to its potential and promising opening,4,22 August 2006,"I've found the majority of M. Night Shyamalan's movies enjoyable even though the critics love to put them down so when my g/f suggested seeing it I went in with an open mind. 'Lady In The Water'starts off particularly well due to an excellent opening narration by Paul Giamatti whose voice promises a clever, griping story. In my opinion it is from here that the film goes down hill. The plot involves Cleveland Heep (Giamatti), an apartment building superintendent, discovering a strange but friendly woman (Bryce Dallas Howard)in the swimming pool he maintains. When he discovers she is from another world and must return there he does everything in his power to help her do so while attempting to protect her from the evil creatures hunting her. While possibly sounding good on paper, I found the story dragging with only the entertaining acting performances of Paul Giamatti and Bryce Dallas Howard keeping the film alive. However the story is intended to be a modern fairytale and admittedly I was hoping for a more mature form but it does appear to be intended for a younger audience who would most likely enjoy its fantasy story although possibly find its evil creatures scary. The plot really falls apart in the middle and becomes frustrating as it becomes increasingly unbelievable and really quite silly leaving the feeling that the director is just making up the story as he goes along not that you will care as you lose interest and begin looking at your watch. I spent most of the film shaking my head and thinking how I could have made the story better myself until the forgettable ending arrived. Overall an instantly forgettable film that only gets a rating this high due to Paul Giamatti's warm performance and the promising opening narration.",Lady in the Water
922,Vapid42,The book sounds great...,3,4 February 2007,"I just watched this movie on DVD. I have to be honest, I did not like this as a movie. My main problem with it was that the audience is thrown into the thick of the fantasy and mystery too quickly. We are presented with a fantasy world in its entirety, and there is almost nothing to draw us into this world. It doesn't really work on an adult level.Than said, I watched M. Night Shyamalan talking about the movie as a bedtime story he told his kids, and discussing his book version of it, and in that context I actually liked it. Hearing him read the book, I think I would read this to kids in a second - I could see myself getting really into this with kids - describing spooky scenery around the pool, doing voices, making faces, whatever. There's nothing wrong with the basic story, it's fun and silly - but it's all wrong for a big-budget film aimed at a mainstream audience.It's got to be fun for his kids, though. I'd like it if my dad could take me favorite bedtime story and turn it into a movie.",Lady in the Water
923,tophilis,literally a bedtime fairy tale,7,31 July 2006,I went to watch this movie with a lot of bad reviews in my head. But half way through the movie you know why the critics are after MNS.After sometime into the movie I felt the concept pretty silly and childish later i realised that this literally is a fairytale for the kids and some of the adults. After the realisation I felt myself drawn into the story. The second half was better and quite thrilling. Overall the movie was good and the story was very creative and original.The acting in the movie was great(Paul Giamatti) while the title character had very little to do. There are enough scary scenes to throw you out of the seat and the climax will pull you to the edge of your seat. But there always lies a possibility that MNS could have made the script crispier... But then he had made the right decision by ditching his usual last-scene-twist-thrillers.loku,Lady in the Water
924,tonguecutsparrow,Advice before and after viewing this film...,8,29 July 2006,"I have been an M. Night fan for quite some time, and while I must agree that ""the Village"" was a very weak story, ""Lady in the Water"" is pure cinematic gold. As one user comment said, ""it is art."" and that's what you need to know going into the movie or if you're reflecting upon it. M. Night advertised the film specifically as a bed time story. Now last time I checked, bedtime stories are for children, so the fantastical and nonsensical aspects of the story are completely fine. There are ""scrunts"" and ""narfs"" and so on, but come on! It's a bedtime story. Go into this film knowing that it is made as if told to a child, and you will enjoy infinitely more. Open up your minds. That's what's lacking so much in today's cinema. Everybody wants explanations handed to them on a silver platter with no thinking or imagination involved. What's the point of cinema if we can't take realistic situations and put a childlike spin on it? It's that sense of just unflinching commitment to fantasy and imagination that makes this movie so enjoyable. Because it requires you to leave your bills and insecurities and job woes at the theatre doors. It's true escapism. And the best part is, when you leave, you might have a couple more answers on how to deal with those woes and insecurities. ""Signs"" was absolutely incredible because it told a large-scale story on such a small scale. M. Night loves his fans (even though he has slipped up from time to time, like with that mockumentary), and he doesn't think of you as stupid, unintelligent zombies working a corporate machine. He has a lot more faith in you as an audience than that. So try giving him a little faith and just go with it. Just sit down. And go with it.",Lady in the Water
925,jmarke,Agree to disagree....(potential spoilers),8,7 August 2006,"There are lots and lots of film genres out there... sci fi, fantasy, drama, comedy, etc. Why?.. because different things appeal to different folks. If everyone liked exactly the same thing, it would be very easy for writers and directors to tailor their handy work directly to the viewer. As it is however, we all like different stuff...I personally like M. Nights movies. Some better than others. Lady in the water is not my favorite of his creations, but I still like it better than most the other stuff in the theaters these days. Will everyone agree? A resounding NO! Why? Because, as they say, ""different strokes for different folks"". I could post my list of favorite M.Night movies, in order of preference, and most of you would disagree. But guess what...it's MY preference. Yours is different... big deal. I can argue with you 'till I'm blue in the face, and I will not change what you like... The same goes for me. How can someone be ""wrong"" for liking a movie someone else doesn't? Lady in the Water takes some chances... it dares to be different than the standard formula. That is one of the reasons I like it. The self contained apartment complex almost feels indeed like a fable or fairy tale, enclosed between the covers of a book. It's almost ""dream-like"", yet based in reality. I also like how it points out that without purpose, there is despair. Yet, with a purpose and ""role"", there is hope.There were things I personally didn't like. The movie felt a little slow in the first half, and like another poster has already said, I felt there should have been a scene where Cleveland has has to question the ""reality"" of the whole fantasy/fairy tale situation.All in all though, a fun, interesting movie (in my opinion) :)",Lady in the Water

I like the fact that MNS performs cameos in his movies. Did he get that from Stephen King? I think MNS's movies are appreciated by the movies goers of higher intelligence.

The idea is rather unique outside of children's movies, and I think is played out very well in this movie.

You don't even realize what's the audience this movie it's intended to, for sure it is not for kids, not credible at all for teens or adults, I know I know, it is fiction, but, for me the idea of fiction in a movie is that, somehow, in a very remote way you'd eventually think that there's a chance sometimes in a parallel world for that to happen, to be real, in this case isn't like that at all, simply, you won't buy the story.

Yes, it's not a Sixth Sense, nor an Unbreakable, not even close to a Village...but who said it should be. Strangely, we are being told from the beginning this movie is just...is just a story, a normal fairytale.Knowing this, you can sit back and enjoy the twists in the plot and the tongue-in-the-cheek comments on movie critics, and not to forget the stunning cinematography and the portrayal of everyday mundane things in a very sensitive way.Like all fairytale stories, there are some points that border on the unbelievable and unrealistic, but none of his previous movies didn't do the same. Lady in the Water is for those with imagination. For those who want to believe.After seeing The Village I was initially disappointed by it, because I had expected more. And that's when I had realized that I was putting Night in a box. I wanted him to perform in a certain way and if he didn't, I would respond like many did about Lady in the Water, ""I just don't get it."" The truth is, that this movie's plot is so simplistic, that if you ""don't get it"", you probably won't get Sleeping Beauty or Rapunzel either. What makes it beautiful, is the presentation and in my opinion, accompanied by a stunning soundtrack.This is fresh for me. I liked it. If you can think outside the box and just for once NOT expect a Sixth Sense, you will begin to truly enjoy Lady in the Water.",Lady in the Water
932,physco_of_09,Lady in the Water will blow your mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,17 July 2006,"When I went to watch a sneak peek of Lady in the Water my expectations were very high. I have liked all of Shaymalans movies and the trailers for Lady in the Water looked very good. With my high expectations I was sure I would be upset a little after the movie, but I wasn't. Once the movie was over I stood up and applauded. I'm not saying Lady in the Water is Shyamalans best movie, but it is definitely his most creative and most unique. All aspects of the movie are incredible: the acting, cinematography, the music. YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS MOVIE! or you'll regret it. I've seen a lot of movies this summer and this is definitely the best.GO SEE LADY IN THE WATER!",Lady in the Water
933,realblackmist,Shyamalan's message is good and clear,9,22 July 2006,"M. Night Shyamalan is one of my favorite directors, and Lady in the Water does not change that fact. I have heard several people say this is the worst movie they have ever seen. Before I saw it tonight I was worried if he had lost his touch. I know people bashed The Village (which I thought was beautiful), but there was even more bashing for this film, which I think is equally as beautiful. Like most every movie, it had it's flaws, and it's not is best movie. But it keeps to his style as a director, was a good mix of humor, suspense and art, and it accomplished Shyamalan's task of making it's message clear through a well thought out story. Why are people hating this movie? Here is why. Shyamalan's returning audience happens to be a large number of people looking for the next Sixth Sense. I agree that this remains his best work, and it also happens to be his work that can be appreciated by the largest number of people because it has a ""twist"" that everyone can be surprised by. Unfortunately now everyone thinks his movies need to have large elaborate twists to shock them by. He is supposed to be Hitchcock and everyone has expectations for his films. HE is ""required"" to shock you or scare you. My response in his defense: No, he isn't.A film, and his are perfect examples, is about story and meaning. Lets not forget what a film is. Storytelling has been passed down to us by the cavemen, and this is a form of storytelling. This means a good story will have a theme, and everyone of Shyamalan's films have been backed by themes better than most of the stuff thrown at us today that gets better reviews. Lady in the Water is about a person's purpose in life. We all have a purpose. He told his story beautifully and the message was clear to me. Can you look past your expectations to be scared or shocked to see his message? Or will you be like most people disappointed because you didn't get your cheap thrill?",Lady in the Water
934,mrbunkles,sucked a$$,1,1 August 2006,"i think that explains itself. i know the movie was not intended to be funny but there were many instances in which i almost died laughing due to the dim witted plot and background of the film. this film seems to be very similar to Shamylan's last film ""The Village"" just in the sense that i went in to the theater with such high expectations and then walked out realizing i just waisted my hard earned money on such a load of crap. I really wanted to like ""Lady"" but the premise of the movie was just so awful.spoiler alert!!!!!!!!! i can honestly tell you i will never look at a box of waffle crisp the same way in my life. Thank you Shamylan for once again lowering my expectations on what a trip to the movie theater should be.",Lady in the Water
935,hkpop,One of the most satisfying experience in the theater,8,21 July 2006,"I just came back from 12:00 pm show on Friday.What should I say, now everything is clear to me. This should be the best MNS movie so far. The serious tones in all of his previous films were significantly tuned down in this one, even though the theme is still very serious. Audenices laughed at all of the appropriate scenes supposed to be funny. It is a very bizzar journey, I laughed, a little bit surprised occasionally, but most unexpectedly, I cried at the end, watched all of the credits, and still had tears in my eyes after I got in the car. I am still not clear why.This is MNS' most personal and emotional movie. As for personal, I don't mean being egocentric. I can see why a lot of people, especially critics said that. My take on this is that MNS firmly believes his message in the film, and wants to tell the audiences by himself. However, his character was extremely humble in the movie. His book was called The Cookbook, and his purpose was told by a narf called ""STORY"". Hello?! How serious that could be? Therefore, I saw MNS carried his message in a very balanced way in this movie. All he wanted to tell us was that we all have our purposes in our lives, and he chosed to tell us by himself. That is not translated into egocentric to me. It is just the message is very personal.As far the critics, well, he has already predicted exact reasons why critics would hate LITW in the movie. Go see for yourself. I am surprised after seeing the movie, any critics would give it a positive review. It is like after being beaten up by him, turn around kissing his ass. That is not happening. He outwitted the critics on this one.This movie will create a loyal, cult-like fan base for him, but I doubt it will please the general crowd. Because it takes certain personality and believes to love it. One has to be pure and innocent in his/her heart in this adult world to appreciate it. If you play the rules of this adult world by heart, believe that power (or greediness) is the way to survive and succeed, this movie is too naive for you. You have to be like Cleveland Heep, laying down on the sofa like a real baby, then, really believing the myth told by the Korean mother.Also, as an Asian (not Indian), nothing offended me. I thought the scenes were light-hearted and funny.",Lady in the Water
936,dvmichael,Typical M. Might flick and that's not a bad thing!,8,1 August 2006,"Let me first say that I love Shyamalan films. I've enjoyed everyone of them, yes, even ""The Village."" I just saw ""Lady in the Water"" yesterday and once again I loved every minute of it. Well, I know Shyamalan likes to put himself in his movies but I think he may have gone a bit too far in this one. Seeing him in such a large role made it very difficult for me to stay in the film. Anyway, he's my favorite director working today. I like that he writes, directs, and produces his own material. I like that his films are unapologetic in their style and content. Even with this latest film, Shyamalan creates this wonderfully odd fairy tale that is totally absurd but within the world he creates works and is great escapism without losing a sense of purpose. I can say that if you don't like Shyamalan films this isn't going to change your mind. And once again, that is why I go to his films. I want to see a director's fingerprints on a film. I want to know purpose without losing that playfulness. I'd rank this film above The Village, about on par with Unbreakable. I'd like to see it again. Then again, though not his most popular film, I""ll argue to the grave with anyone that ""Signs"" is his best film. It jumped up to MY TOP FIVE LIST the moment the credits rolled.",Lady in the Water
937,banksj,Lady In The Water - A True Bedtime Story,8,17 July 2006,"Bottom line: Phili must be a crazy place to live.I walk into every M. Night film knowing, good or bad, I am going to see a picture that is imaginative, original, and full of hope. This is one of very few writer/directors who actually strive to bring something new to the cinema on each different outing.So, how was the film? Good. Dare I say, great? If you like his films, this one will definitely hit you deep. You'll put it at the top of your ""M. Night List"", and be glad to have it in your DVD collection later this year.First, the acting. We all know Night has a habit of picking actors from the same pool. People he knows, trusts, and has worked with before. Willis has helmed two of his films, while Joaquin another two. This will be Bryce Dallas Howards second as well. We are used to Night writing his lead characters as more of a shadow of a man that once was. A tragic figure; this is no different in ""Lady In The Water"".Giamatti plays Heep very, very well. But, because of Giamatti's inclusion into Nights' world, we see things much lighter. Willis, Gibson, and Phoenix had a habit of turning everything dark and dreary. And while Giamatti is still a tragic figure, he is eager to believe and more than willing to take the word of a half naked girl in his home. I, personally, believe that he is the greatest actor Night has worked with. And the result? A much lighter film. Thank God.This is a fantasy. Not a horror, not a film with a twist (spoiler: there is none), which is good, because a twist would have put Night into an early grave. As a fantasy, a bed time story, Night treats us like children. Characters speak their inner dialogues, creatures with interesting names plague us at every turn, and the residents of this apartment complex are as interesting and comic as they are important.There is still the important Night message: Purpose. We all have one. We all are meant to be somebody. Now, all we have to do is figure that out.Even the intro reads like a children's' book; illustrations dance about in order to create a younger element to this tale.The plot is simple. Nymphs, beasts, guilds, healers, etc. Almost like a role-playing video game in a sense.The music and cinematography? Night kept his all-star team, and the project was helmed and sculpted beautifully.The faults? I dare say Night could have done with less characters. They all seemed important, but it crowded the screen, and left us with a question: Is this that persons' only purpose? That's sad.But, have fun with this film. It's a treat, as rare as Nights' films are.Night brings a world of reality into a world of dreams, and the saddest point of the film, was when we had to wake up.",Lady in the Water
938,pi314-1,Give it a chance... Maybe 2.,8,23 July 2006,"I just finished watching Mr. Shyamalan's film and, though I usually enjoy his work, I must say that I had a more difficult time enjoying this one. Aside from the 15-year-old kids who I wanted to be summarily euthanized for ruining my movie-going experience, I still could not seem to get into this film as much. My theory, and feel free to ardently disagree, is that the most successful Shyamalan films have achieved said success because they derive their story lines from already formed mythologies.The Sixth Sense was a ghost story. Everyone loves a ghost story. That was the hook that drew people into the theaters and from there, Night had them. TSS was definitely an entertaining film and seriously, who doesn't enjoy dead people? Unbreakable was essentially a postmodern superhero film created before the comic-book-to-screen renaissance ushered in by Spiderman and the like. As an American, I found I could really relate to what was going on in this story. Superheroes were ever-present in my not-too-distant childhood.Signs: Alien invasion. We've been concerned about beings from another planet since far before H. G. Wells seminal work of fiction came about.Once Shyamalan had his audiences with these enticing ""hooks,"" he could begin to tell his real stories. Much like Hitchcock, the director to whom many have drawn (premature) comparisons, Shyamalan's films aren't ABOUT ghosts, superheroes, aliens, creatures in the woods, or water nymphs. They begin within these contexts, then tell their stories based on these premises. TSS was more about lost love and abandonment. Unbreakable more a family tome. Signs was much the same. In the Village, what were the REAL monsters? These would constitute what Hitch called his ""McGuffins."" ""Plots"" intended to attract as well as distract from the real meaning.The reason LITW hasn't done quite as well is because it lacks that sort of coherent artifice that MNS' first four films had. There is no established cultural mythology surrounding narfs, skrunts, and turtikics (sp). We can't understand them as well as we can ghosts and the like. What was hard for me and, I think, many audiences, was simply grasping this film. I need to see it again to give it a better evaluation, but I think that the story is simply SO contrived that the film's plot is all the less apparent. The real story IS there! Is it Cleveland's denial, sorrow and eventual redemption? Is it his tenant's sense of community? Again, I think this film warrants a MUCH more objective eye and, at the very least, another chance.",Lady in the Water
939,pasmcninja,Writer/ Director/ Producer?,5,23 July 2006,"After having seen M. Night Shyamalan's portfolio of films, I find myself wondering what all the hype is about? I sit to watch the movies and find that they are visually appealing, and the story is generally content rich. However I never get any real message out of the film, and continue to find myself one or two steps ahead of the plot development.Lady in the Water, was again no different for me. It is my personal favorite of the Shyamalan set, but will give credit for that to Paul Giamatti and the comedic portions of the movie. The actors in the film, do portray their characters very well; Shyamalan actually getting a substantial role as Vick was very enjoyable.I find myself wondering if anyone else has been disappointed by the hype associated with these films. Sixth Sense took me all of 25 minutes to figure out - Unbreakable took even less time.Shyamalan seems to be a very talented individual, but I would like to see what he would bring to the table if he were a little less intoxicated with his own story. It seems that if he spent less energy in one area, he might be able to be more creative in another. Get a script and build the rest. I understand that being a ""visionary"", could be difficult if you let others help you form your idea, but I would still be curious as to what the work would become.",Lady in the Water

To that end, he has created an enjoyable film that to me rectifies my disappointment with the Village. The acting was solid with yet another wonderful performance by the amazing Paul Giamatti as well as a fantastic supporting cast. The fact that Disney would so quickly cast such a diligently crafted film seems foolish at this point. I think we can look forward to many more great films from this stellar director.

944,velvetbeatle,Fantastic fairytale - but not for everyone. (Minor spoilers),9,10 September 2006,"I went to see Lady in the Water last night and have to say I loved it. I do think that you have to view the movie almost as if you're being read a bedtime story, some of the set pieces are unlikely to happen in the real world (obviously) so you really need to leave your reality hat at home. The performances were excellent, especially the great Paul Giamatti (Cleveland) and the enchanting Bryce Dallas Howard (Story) who manages to convey the lost, sometimes bewildered, narf perfectly. Even Shyamalan does a very respectable job as Vick, the writer with a block.The whole thing has an almost theatrical feel as it is set entirely in the apartment complex where Giamatti is the maintenance man - this for me adds a cohesion to the whole story, placing the narrative in the confines of one ""enchanted"" area.There are flaws in the movie though, the ending is a little unsatisfying and Giamatti must set records for his breath holding abilities, but like I said earlier if you leave your reality hat at home it all works supremely well.I possibly may be biased as I love M. Night Shyamalans work, even the much maligned The Village and (for some) the unsatisfactory Signs and Unbreakable. Definitely a movie I will be seeing again and will continue to think about in the weeks ahead.",Lady in the Water
945,urbanrhino,M Night Blows it again,3,21 July 2006,"The film goes nowhere that it doesn't tell you it is going to go in the first place. There is so much hand holding in the story telling, that the only thing that keeps you interested is the possibility of maybe a surprise happening in the future. There are no surprises. Quite the opposite in fact, the film tells you what is going to happen and how and then it happens. I was hoping that Night would redeem himself after the Village, but that is definitely not the case. It is more like an interactive children's ride at Disney than any sort of ""suspensful mystery"" that Night has gotten a reputation for. Don't waste your time with this film. Wait for a rental.",Lady in the Water
946,Wormie1,Dead in the Water,2,15 August 2006,"With his last four movies - The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs and The Village - M. Night Shyamalan stuck to a successful formula of placing ordinary people in extraordinary supernatural or extra-terrestrial situations and putting a big twist into the story. Lady in the Water has no such twist, but it also differs from his previous films in that it is a total disaster. There is a prologue which explains the mythology of creatures such as narfs (sea-dwelling people) and scrunts (wolf-like beasts), which is reminiscent of the opening sequence of Watership Dow. The story then moves on to the present day in which an apartment block janitor, played by Paul Giamatti, discovers a narf, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, in the complex's outdoor swimming pool. Scrunts are attempting to stop Howard from returning to the pool. This is really all there is to the plot. Shyamalan first told this tale as a bedtime story to his kids, and it must have put them to sleep, because it almost did me. The mythology is really not worked out, and, more crucially, neither are the story or characters.Giamatti does his best, but his character is saddled with a speech impediment (presumably to make him appear more humble, which every other aspect of his character and performance already tells us). The rest of the cast is also OK; the only standout being the hilarious Korean girl. Shyamalan himself plays a writer destined for greatness (talk about delusions of grandeur!), while Bob Balaban plays a film critic who gets it all wrong. It was a bit mean of Shyamalan to have a dig at the critics given that his previous films were generally well-reviewed.This film does not work on any level, it is a complete bore, and even the cinematography has a murky look to it. The only upside is that it does have an original concept, but it is entirely understandable why Shyamalan's usual backers, Disney, passed on this turkey.",Lady in the Water
947,intjames,Did everyone miss this?,10,23 July 2006,"All the comments I've read thus far on M. Night's new flick say that it is silly and somewhat frustrating. What viewers may not realize is that the sloppy camera angles, stereotypical characters, and completely predictable storyline are all commentary on movie-making in this day and age. The film is extreme self-reflexive, and there's a reason! Take, for instance, the most notable example, the essential characters of the story that Cleveland unites based on the fairytale. He recalls the most stereotypical characters (described to him by the movie critic) and brings them together to form a protective net around STORY (i.e., these characters will legitimate/hold up the story). However, his plan obviously falls through when the wolf breaks through the whole plan. Round 2, Cleveland changes all of the roles, exchanging the guild, the interpreter, etc., thus generating a new story, and thus curtailing the stereotypical characters and plot lines. It is such a blatant commentary that I'm surprised anyone could miss it. If you think of such utter letdowns in film today (Superman, The Breakup...), and the fact that studios are capitalizing on remakes of stories already told, it makes perfect sense that Shyamalan should come up with a completely novel bedtime story (as opposed to comic book action-adventure) to call out the monotonous and redundant films that I've payed to see this year.",Lady in the Water

Let me just say I Loved It.I thought it was beautiful and original in every way. The CGI effects were superb and the plot was magnificent. The jigsaw storyline had me entranced throughout the movie, and my attention never left the screen. The plot is fairly simple. A janitor finds a water nymph in an apartment complex's pool and finds out all of the people in the apartment complex are characters in a Japanese bedtime story. The problem is, trying to find out who is what character. That is the basic plot outline, but aside from the plot and the magnificent screenplay, there is a whole slew of things that were almost perfect. First and foremost, I'd like to commend James Newton Howard for his amazing score. It made me feel as if I was actually in a fairy tale. The cinematography was amazing and the CG effects were marvelous. The whole atmosphere was mystical.My favorite part was the acting. Paul Giamatti did a great job, but it was Bryce Dallas Howard who stole the show. Her face conveyed every emotion she was probably feeling in every situation, and any actress who can do that is worthy of recognition. Overall, it was a great movie with nothing going against it.",Lady in the Water
952,xfusejc,Shyamalan did it again.,9,22 July 2006,"I just got back from a late night showing of the movie. Shyamalan delivered once again. I'm one of those ""weirdos"" who greatly enjoyed 'The Village' and as far back as I've gone with him (Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs), he has yet to truly disappoint me.I've been reading a lot of the reviews from the movie so far, and in most of them there seems to be a running theme: the acting is great, while the story (or the explanation thereof) is completely idiotic. I went into the film expecting a movie based on bedtime story from Shyamalan's mind that grew with the telling, and it didn't deviate from that. I didn't expect a twist, since I knew it wasn't coming, and even after watching the trailers, I expected thrilling moments, but not a ""scary"" film per se. People tend to compare all of his movies against 'The Sixth Sense', and I find it so amazingly stupid that somebody would do such a thing instead of actually seeing the film for what it is, standing alone, without trying to find a pretense on it... people are just odd.The acting is phenomenal. Giamatti, bless him, is such a great actor; Bryce Dallas Howard, who, once again, did not disappoint me in any way, is given a great role, and she works it wonderfully. I have to mention Jefrrey Wright because he was (besides Shyamalan himself) the only other supporting character I recognized from the film, and he was his usual great. Shyamalan surprised me. He took on a much bigger role than his usual cameo and he was actually very good at it. I loved the digs to the critics. I liked that he set let his political point of view show.The story is good. It is made up of rules that keep on appearing as it goes along, but it doesn't preach them to the audience. It really does tell them as if they were being told to a kid, which I didn't find condescending or as a way to preach to the people watching it.I highly recommend it.

954,mastertherion,Worst Shyamalan yet... crappy and cheap,3,31 August 2006,"Close-down clearance sale! Shyamalan, formerly hailed as a scriptwriting genius, has finally come to a point of pathetic creative impotence. With his latest feature, Lady in the Water, he unflinchingly sells out the last scraps of faint ideas he has left, offering a kind of ironic and overly explicit reflection on his own (former) writing method  no wonder he appears in a more front-row part this time. And believe me; you don't get much beyond this lazy and hackneyed meta-position game, but a handful of feeble jokes bearing the taste of cheap sitcoms plus the usual rather disgusting Syhamalan-crowd-pleaser: the conveyance of a sense of THE GREAT BEYOND, an untruthful and naive spirituality. (Okay, this time, being more  and again: in an over-expressed way  fairytale-like, it is not so horrendous like in Signs.) There are no three-dimensional characters, no real plot, not to mention an intriguing twist at the end... and even the special effects are somewhat lame. It's time for Mr. Shyamalan to take the words of the film critic in his flick seriously and realize that his originality has run dry. He should move on and start directing other people's scripts like his idol Hitchcock did. My advice: avoid this movie from far  re-watch The Sixth Sense instead.",Lady in the Water
955,ghostintheshell_71,Good story but not for everyone,7,22 July 2006,"When did Terry Gilliam start writing M. Night Shyamalan films? Lady in the Water really brought films like the Fischer King to mind for me. This is an absolute freak show, very silly and even a bit corny at times but was essentially enjoyable, has a good story, interesting characters and leaves you with a big warm fuzzy at the end. This is also the funniest film he has ever produced- the audience could not stop laughing, unfortunately there were also a lot of snorts, and though I could not see them, my sixth sense told me a lot of rolling eyes as well.Lady in the Water revolves around an Asian ""bedtime story"", and that is about how the film feels, like a kid's fairy tale. I personally liked it a lot but I think the corniness won't work for many people looking for typical, scary Shyamalan fare.",Lady in the Water
956,neoluca,"A brilliant Movie, one of M. Night's Greatest.",8,24 July 2006,"As we all know, M. Night SHymylan has created some of the best works of our time, including the Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs. This is not a movie that is par to those, but nevertheless worth watching and seeing on all levels, especially if you like M. Night's style of directing.Music: The score that Night uses in all of his movies has always been grand and sensational, causing a ripple in your back. This has that same effect and doesn't cease to amaze. The music is definitely worth a 10/10.Plot: I have to start of by saying that it is a bedtime story. Because of that it can be somewhat silly and far-fetched, especially with the odd creatures and ideas. Nevertheless, it is well put together and flows well, with a few jerks here and there. 7.5/10 Acting and Characters: Separately, the main actors and actresses in here acted, well, beautifully. Paul played his part very well and gave you the sensation of a gentle, kind, peaceful man just wanting to get by. Bryce gave you the idea that she was indeed a lost, scared, and confused child, which is more or less what she was. The rest topped it off with humorous little aspects or strict little twists (in the characters) that brought it together nicely. M. Night himself plays a much larger part in this one. In total, he probably plays more in this one than he does in total for all of his other movies. 9/10 So there you have it:Overall 8.5/10 and well worth it. No matter what anyone says this is definitely a move to go see and own on DVD!",Lady in the Water
957,ericgendron,Give it a chance and you'll like it,8,6 August 2006,"OK so believe me when i say that i am among the scores of people that thought ""The Village"" was weird, had an incredibly nonsensical ending, and just overall not a very good movie. However i went into ""Lady"" with an open mind. When i left the theater i had decided that it was one of Shaymalan's most entertaining films to date. The critics led a full on assault on this movie dubbing it ""his worst to date"". Not true...that was the Village. I can understand why it didn't become the box-office smash or even cult classic like it hoped to be. But i feel that is the fault of the viewers and critics, not in this case the film it self. I heard several times that viewers thought the movie was bad because the famed ""Shaymalan Twist"" never comes. Granted. It doesn't, but that's because it's not that type of story. It doesn't need a twist because it's a type of story telling that instead relies on building action, and uncovering secrets throughout the movie. So were many people think that Shaymalan failed to pull off the twist they expected him to pull, he was actually using a different type of story telling. The same terror and suspense that we've come to expect from Mr. M. is still there and in full form, he has just brought the whole thing about differently. Howard and Giamatti both deliver fantastic performances; Paul in particular (his climactic emotional speech he gives while holding Story is beautiful). All of the sub-characters delivered entertaining performances and the cinematography was dazzling as well. My point is if you've seen this movie and decided that you didn't like it, my advice is to see it again and approach it with a different outlook on it. If you haven't seen it yet, you'd do well to keep in mind that you're in for a quite different Shaymalan story telling experience.",Lady in the Water

It's absolutely brilliant. Though I tried to convince myself that M. Night Shyamalan didn't put a twist in this movie, he did. Because I read the comments about Lady in the Water on IMDb before I went and saw it I knew what to expect. The comments helped a lot because I think several people went to this movie expecting something a bit more scary like Signs or The Village and got this incredible tale instead.

The link however between mermaid and grizzly wolves seems slightly out of touch of what one might expect from the mystical world (wolves being alive and present in our modern reality), perhaps a more a mystical enemy would have provided heightened entertainment. In the end, the mix of modern quirky characters with the mystery of magical mermaids and eagles is endearing.

Take them to this uneven, tedious and, at times, quite senseless belly flop of a film.There were points in this movie where ""the rules"" set forth by the protagonists became so horribly convoluted that all we could do was simply look at one another with strained laughter.The premise is an absolute train wreck. It's like watching a group of drunk tech school nerds play Dungeons and Dragons: ""The Narf must find The Guild and The Guardian to protect her from the tree monkeys and the lawn wolf so that a giant eagle can come take her back to the Blue World."" There are a few genuinely frightening moments-- mostly revolving around a wolf made out of twigs, branches and a sundry of lawnmower debris. There were also a couple of funny moments centering around Giamatti's character, Heep-- a bumbling superintendent and unwilling, tragic hero.Despite Giamatti's luminous presence, the movie tends to meander and poke along at a snails pace-- often doubling-back over issues that seemed to have been resolved two or three times. You know every character must fulfill some sort of niche and in no time, you have figured it out.Unlike most of Shymalan's movies, you have all the angles figured out before the end. No one is who they seem, all roles are reversed, key events happen at a predictable and stale moments. There's no zest, no perversion of the course of events-- everything is telegraphed to you long before it happens.It gets a three because Giamatti works so hard to make the movie watchable. He's still great, even in this bloated corpse of a movie.",Lady in the Water

A pretty bad movie, and truly the worst of M. Night's filmography. Question do water nymphs have any distinguishable features? Story had no gills or webbed feet, what's the deal?, not enough budget money for costume or make-up? Also, who exactly are the monkey men? Why do the people of the Cove have no difficulty in accepting that a water nymph lives in their pool? Why does the kid see messages in cereal boxes of all places?

I can only think that the reason it was universally panned is self-evident in the story line. I also enjoyed Mr. Shyamalan's performance. I thought he was absolutely credible. I viewed this movie as one wherein the message is hope. That we are not alone and that one always has a chance for redemption. I can't see where that message cannot appeal to all viewers. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Mr.Shyamalan's movies. This and Unbreakable are my two favorites. In both instances,he has gone way outside of the norm and come up with a totally original idea.

Night knows how to tweak the normal to constantly add uniqueness to his film making. The camera angels, the score, the colors...There were three people in front of me, and before the movie they seemed disinterested in being at the theater, were text messaging and just being young adults. I was a bit nervous. Even when the movie first started, they were making a bit of small talk, but after a few minutes, they were all fully engaged in this film. That is why I noted this film as a film ride. It starts down the track, and as it picks up speed, Shyamalan begins to tweak with you. He keeps you on the edge of your emotional seat during the entire ride. And this is what makes him a modern master filmmaker. When the film ended, everyone took a deep breath and just sat for a moment collecting themselves after the thrilling ride.I sat through Pirates 2, and there was just no emotional interest. Perhaps a few chuckles at most. ""Lady in the Water"" is the exact opposite. I am glad to see that creative films can still be made and brought to main stream theaters in this day of ""blockbuster"" or bust. Personnaly I am tired of crazy chase scenes and explosions ala' the Bruckheimer's of Hollywood.

I think critics are just annoyed at the annoying critic in the film that fills all stereotypes. A great movie to see, one of his best. All of this is based on the idea of a bedtime story that turns out to be true. The suspense is believing the story to begin with and translating it into reality. Giamatti's character is hiding himself in a crummy job in a hotel of interesting characters that are necessary to fulfill the plot in the story. It is far fetched, but is based on belief in the extraordinary and not reality. A solid enjoyment for my wife and I, highly recommended.",Lady in the Water

Paul Giamatti's performance was superb. However, the movie was so predictable, unlike ""The Village"". I found the story itself too twisted and at time impossible to understand. A sure sign of disappointment is the reaction I heard through out the theater at the end. It's sad when there is a consensus of ticked off movie goers. Maybe ""Scary Movie 5"" could do a recap of this and actually have Sesame Street's Big Bird show up for the ""big bird"" they say will come and collect Story.

However, humor me and read my opinion : I feel Shyamalan is the victim of his first popular movie The Sixth Sense. While i find it to be a very good movie, it gave people the wrong impression. I gave people the impression Shyamalan's movies will be about twists and that it is all you can expect from him. However, M. Night Shyamalan is a poet. A story teller in the purest sense. And Lady in the Water is the illustration of this in all its metaficticious joy. A story changes its author. A story changes its readers. And you should always believe the story, not the story teller. What's more, you should fall in love with Story, especially when she's that sweet. So please, forget the serious adult inside you, bring back the kid who wants to go out and play.

Paul Giamatti as the stuttering superintendent is absolutely amazing. Everybody initially thought that 'Night' would be appearing only in a couple of scenes but his presence was felt all through the movie.

I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you just sit and amerce yourself in the story, you can just soak in the information and think nothing of it. It's like saying the Sixth Sense is bad because it's a ghost story. Signs is bad because no one knows if aliens are real. Unbreakable is bad because the concept is based off of comic books. I think you get my point. His movies aren't conventional, and that's what makes them great. If you enjoyed his others, I'm sure you'll love this one too. If you just want to nitpick at every little thing, then you won't enjoy it. If you can't enjoy fantasy or fiction, then don't go. Don't believe the critics either, find out if you like it for yourself. Frankly, my opinion shouldn't matter to you either. Go see for yourself.

974,Blakea234,"Riveting, Phantasmagorical Fantasy",10,28 July 2006,"Don't hate. That movie was genius. Imaginative, original, and at times humorous, Shyamalan has concocted a fairy tale for adults who are still kids at heart. Just seeing it makes me want to go watch it again, at least two more times just to be able to take in anything I may have missed.A lot of critics are reviewing the film negatively, saying that it is too over-the-top, that it had such a potential but wasn't achieved. That M. Night himself was too self-indulgent for playing his biggest on-screen role to date, but really, this story isn't about adhering to the norms of Hollywood and what Hollywood wants in it's theaters. Shyamalan's movies are genre bouncing, well-photographed and amazingly scored films that always provide his social commentary, whether symbolic or overt, on faith and the supernatural.In one scene in particular, the ""scrunts"" are trooping around the pool area waiting for Story to come back out after her first attack, and Heep finds out that the Tartutics (monkey things) somehow weren't keeping the peace as they should be because everything is supposed to fear them.""They weren't supposed to be able to do that. Where aren't the Tartutics helping? Where is the justice?"" Heep's overdubbed dialogue says.This is just one example of the extended metaphor of war that Shyamalan has entwined into the plot. Notice, every television set has news reports with military images. Helicopters, Tanks, Explosions.This fairy tale, as most are, is another symbol for real life. If the US is feared by most, if we are the peacekeepers (much like the Tartutics) then why are there rogue scrunts (the people who commit crimes, the terrorists) that do not fear us? Where is the justice? Apparently they know that the deliverance of the Lady (or the realization of something universal) is too high a cost to not put their lives at stake for. Movies like this leave me thought-provoked and pensive, wishing I could keep interacting with the characters. I think, however, it is easier to resort to bashing a film that to understanding it. ""Big Fish"" was imaginative and inventive as well on that fairy tale level. The difference here is that Tim Burton expanded the story over many different settings while Shyamalan kept his fairy tale inside the boundaries of a not-so-fairy tale place in Pennsylvania (much like you will see all of his movies take place in). I won't expand anymore on this, but just know that another fan has been won over, inspired, and motivated to find his own existence in that ""way we are all connected.""

All characters are likable, and if it doenst contains any surprise in the end, is nice how he sees normal characters (or antiheroes) in a new light because of the circumstances.Well, thats my thought, i don't think its a great movie, but is very nice.",Lady in the Water

LITW would fit in on par with Signs, as the more I think about this movie, the more I reflect upon it, the more I realize how much I love it.The simple idea of having an apartment complex come together as a whole to attempt to rescue something most of them would never believe in is, in my mind, refreshing. Usually, all these types of characters would never believe such a thing, but we know how M. Night feels about people trying to figure out his characters. ;) Anyway, the mood of the film was perfect, I enjoyed every single character in the movie, it was as if I could have watched a separate film about the lives of the other characters and been enthralled in those movies, they all had such a past to them.The story, I'll admit, did seem a bit forced, it kind of went from a slow build up to everything and suddenly we're being chases by creatures out of no where, but after that it maintains a steady pace and keep you hooked till the end.Finally, M.

Shyamalan is a master story teller and the continuity in the story is just profound. It touches humanity on much deeper level than any of his other movies and he actually even gave himself a pretty big role in the movie (which I originally thought was a bad idea since he's so recognizable, but he actually made it work.). Durng the movie, I kept thinking that this was an epic kind of movie but then I realized the setting is some cheap apartment complex with overgrown grass and not some exotic countryside with amazing shots of jagged, snow covered mountain tops. Yet the epic part of it just can't be ignored. It's an amazing way to give the audience the feeling they are actually participating in this epic story, because your like, ""I pass that apartment complex everyday on my way to work,"" or ""those guys are my neighbors.""

I see it like this: what's ""happening"" in LITW is just a metaphor for the path to self-healing of a man who suffered an existential unbearable tragedy - he's lost everything that he loved, and there was an inner implosion - he collapsed (like Parry in The Fisher King). The whole film is Cleveland's dream, his path towards salvation from an altered state. The scene with Cleveland healing Story by facing his own story (!) is very suggestive in this sense - it's a version of the ancient story of the Fisher King. The Holy Grail is just a metaphor for accepting, and dealing with the truth - for Parry just as well as for Cleveland. Here, ""the truth"" has almost a religious acceptation, as in ""the truth will set you free."" Of course can't be just a mechanical analogy - in many other senses those two films are very different. But I can see LITW as very similar to a TFK told from Parry's point of view. After his loss, Parry was living in his own world, he had his own visions with that ""knight in flames"" and with the Holy Grail that would heal him. Similarly, Cleveland is living in his own world - the whole film is his vision. Taking LITW as a normal plot involving some characters, it may look nonsensical to some people. But this film follows a purpose, just as each character in LITW serves a purpose. Purpose is a very important concept in both TFK and LITW films. The characters who surround Cleveland are highly archetypal. They may look real, but they're not - just like the ""narf"" and the ""strunt"", all of them are creations of Cleveland's mind, as everything in this film is - from the top of The Cove to the bottom of the pool.",Lady in the Water
986,princemusicrocks,Lady in the Water is cool!,10,21 July 2006,"M. night did not disappoint me. Like I told everyone before I saw the film, M. Nights movies are all about the theme underlying the story, also his top notch quality of cinematography, soundtrack, and overall movie making. His concepts are always original, especially compared to current Hollywood fare..I think that is what a lot of M. Night naysayers can't handle. Maybe they would rather see any other of the regular movies coming out lately in theaters....you know, a remake or a sequel or a TV show or a video game turned into a movie. Count those types of movies out of the current movies playing and see how many are left. Probably zip, unless its something cool like Lady in the Water.",Lady in the Water
987,mavnick,M Night has lost his muse,3,24 July 2006,"M Night has lost his muse. He had such promise after the 6th Sense and Unbreakable. The whole film was so utterly without purpose. Tired dialog, characters that you could only guess as to their inner demons. He used devices that are to shock the audience that have been used in his other films. When Story tells the author that he will write a great book and that his sister would have seven children, the audience laughed. She should have told him that your next three films will be duds and you will end up working the graveyard shift at a Seven Eleven in South Philly. I can see why the folks at Disney passed it up. When he first came on the film scene, I thought he was fresh and full of new ideas that really made you think about film. But now he seems to have exhausted those fresh ideas and repackages them in a new wrapper, hoping that no one will notice.",Lady in the Water
988,am_cutler,"Lame, if I could give it a zero I would!",1,8 February 2007,"For starters I was excited by the previews, this looked like an adventure movie, action, with at least one name character, although the rest were no names. I was bored 10 minutes in but thought maybe it would pick up. The plot, well there is no plot really. The story is boring. The budget for this must have been zero because it is really not what I had expected in the form the preview was. The humor that they try to bring in is not funny. Part of the movie tries to explain a movie (kind of like scary movie did) and what would happen, by one of the characters saying what he thinks. The viewer ends up scratching their head wondering what the writer was trying to accomplish by doing that. I am very disappointed in this work as I like most of M. Night Shamalan's movies but by far this is the worst movie I have ever seen.",Lady in the Water
989,masonmd,Lady in the Water continues M. Night Shyamalan's philosophical/religious themes.,10,26 December 2006,"I see Shyamalan's films as consistently treating philosophical/religious themes and Lady in the Water is perhaps the deepest of them all so far. But the film cannot be taken literally. If the LITW is seen only as a literal story it becomes comical at best and more likely an absurd break from Shyamalan's past tradition. Given Shyamalan's history of presenting philosophical/religious topics, it seems unlikely he would now turn to farce. However, if seen figuratively I think the film becomes deeply religious and potently meaningful. Each character from the myth that plays a central part of the film's plot becomes significant to us today if their factual counterpart actually existed...a divine messenger from another world coming with information to turn the tide of evil which is destroying humankind; someone who has suffered enough of life's hardships to become deeply bitter yet remains loving, serving and kind; a prophet or foreteller who interprets the lives of others and can see the eternal in the mundane, etc.If interpreted as a symbolic message about religion for a world frightened by what seems to be endless chaos, fear, and death, LITW brings a sense of the mysterious intervention each of us is hoping for. Certainly the humor of the film adds to the intrigue of life. Life is bizarre. People are comical. So often we take ourselves so seriously, and life seems so very serious, yet what if in our naiveté we were all capable of doing something far greater than we thought, if we could only tap into a divine source of communication. In an intriguing way Shyamalan forces the viewer to ask the question, what if divine communication came to us, how would we react? Wouldn't we want it to be real, even though it might seem fairy tale or possibly childish? Maybe the film truly speaks for each of us when saying, ""I've been wanting for something real to believe in for too long!""",Lady in the Water
990,vsreed24,I LOVED this movie!,10,22 July 2006,"I'm a pretty big fan of M. Night, only because you never really know what to expect when walking in. Before my plot was even delved into, my friend and I looked at each other and said, ""we love this random cast of characters!"" In the apartment complex, there are so many different personality types to get to know. That's just one of the things I found to love. It was a little scary, but there were still a lot more kids than adults in the theater. I only jumped out of my seat once, but it still kept me wondering from scene to scene what was going to happen next. The acting is wonderful, even a very nice performance by M. Night himself. Again, I'm definitely giving it a great review. Nice escape for a summer night!",Lady in the Water
991,scortillum,Giamatti,9,21 July 2006,"Examining the reviews, the critics seem to be quite split as to what to think of this movie. As to whether it is a flop or a masterpiece I am not contesting, I hold my own opinion. However, I do feel this movie was made by Paul Giamatti, and he should be applauded for his stellar performance. From his convincing stutters, to his screams of terror, you can certainly feel his character as a real person.I admit though, having Giamatti mixed in with all the other lower-grade actors definitely emphasized their badness.One thing I was wondering though: why was NO ONE in this film in utter disbelief of all the crazy crap going on? It seemed from the very beginning Cleveland (and all the other characters) were willing to believe what Story had to say.",Lady in the Water
992,cameronlovesjesus,Stop being a cynic and relax.,10,21 July 2006,"For those of you that have seen an M. Night movie, you know that the movie will contain scenes of suspense, broken adult male leads (ussually those with the loss of a loved one) and a supernatural element. Until now M.Night has worked with Ghosts, Superheroes, Aliens, and Monsters. This latest outing was the genre of Fantasy/Fairy Tale. Lady in the Water could've been told in two very different ways. One way would be a movie for children, with characters that are very visual and static, and foreshadowing that requires very little brainpower to figure out. Or he could have made a movie for adults, with complex pasts and dialog heavy sequences that all lead up to something dark. Lady in the Water is interesting because it accepts both ways as one way. M.Night somehow made a movie that is compatible with children, and just as compatible with the adult. His earlier works have been very cynical, and sometimes dark. This film is different, the characters are light. The humor doesn't lose it's touch halfway through the movie, and in some respects the humor adds to the sadness. In order to watch this movie for what it really is, is to stop being a cynic, or a tough critic, and just watch the movie from start to finish without trying to outsmart it. Yet that's how you watch a movie by M. Night. You just let it take you through the journey, and you can decide how you liked it afterwords. Worth a watch, but don't expect something incredible.",Lady in the Water

Yea the sixth sense, unbreakable and signs were really good, but i believe the village and lady in the water are his best works because they deal with life. Real life. Not ghosts, or aliens or superheroes but people in general. Our generation as a whole and how messed up it is. The village dealt with the deranged people and how innocent people die in society, and lady in the water was the same thing.

First, it breaks with Hollywood rules and norms and thus is unlike anything seen before. In other words, unique, definitely not Hollywood. Second, it is important for M. Night Shyamalan as it represents something of a breakthrough for him. He has finally gotten out of the rut he was in. All of his films after The Sixth Sense were basically the same movie with different stories. They followed the same formula, they all had surprise endings, or at least had surprises in them. They all had the same pacing, the same music. That's why this film is so important because Night has finally broken the mold, and now he can grow as a director, producer, writer and actor. Well, maybe NOT as as actor! Leave the acting to the actors, Night!",Lady in the Water

Night didn't know whether to play this movie seriously or as a spoof. Just when the audience began to understand the stakes involved in getting this girl safely back to her world, Night would introduce another ""merry mixup"" in who was the Interpreter, the Guild, etc. and portray these oddballs as hardly believable instruments in the quest to return this girl to her undersea world.

Many small details cropped up that had no prior history or development and no apparent reasoning behind them. Additionally, there were a lot of things left hanging at the end. The ideas of the story had a lot of potential, but it didn't come together. It seems as if this was a 30-second sneak-peek into some storybook world that the audience is supposed to somehow already know about.

They were really intrigued about the idea of it being a bedtime story and were very interested to find out if it was a real story or not.I feel like all of his movies have such a great message just below the sruface---and this one was about faith, healing, and love.

I went into this movie with no expectations, no doubts, and no thoughts. I did not know what to expect other than a fairy tale created by Shyamalon. There are many things he, Shyamalon, is trying to do with this film other than just tell an innovative bed time story. There are so many depictions that this movie displays it is hard to pick what Shyamalon wants you, the viewers, to get out of this movie. I believe that he wants you to reserve your own opinions because everyone is going to come out of it thinking one of two ways, that Shyamalon is a freaking lunatic or that what he was trying to say was brilliant. If you come out thinking he is a lunatic than you haven't even began to scratch the surface of that movie and I recommend you go and see Lady in the Water again. You probably left that movie and said something of along the lines of ""what the hell just happened in there"" or ""what on earth is a scrunt.""

1000,sharkro,This Movie is Smarter than You,10,21 February 2017,I have read countless reviews of this movie and it makes me so happy that M has gotten the best of so many people with this movie. The simplicity is the genius behind it. The story and the characters are so much more complex than what you can gather from watching it. It requires one thing to watch a movie and understand what's happening and that's a willing suspension of disbelief. This movie requires two - WSD and Willingness to Understand something you can't actually see because you are distracted by the movie itself looking and seeming dull and uninvolved.THE COVE - is the place where damaged and strange outcasts all wind up (a cove by definition is a small SHELTERED bay) Mr. HEEP - (heap - a messy pile or great amount of stress put upon someone) Harry Farber - Cleveland's emptiness & loneliness unimpressed and uninvolved Story - Cleveland's fragile faith in god or love or life needing to be savedThese are just a FRACTION of the subtle genius in this film.Spend some time considering that this movie is probably one of the most well- developed and thoughtful ideas every put on screen.

I agree with you about the camera angles, the unique story, and Giamatti's impeccable acting. I have to admit I was surprised to hear critics call his character ""unrelatable"". Anyone who has ever endured pain in their life could easily see that world through Cleveland's eyes. And as for M. Night, though he could stand to use some acting lessons, he wasn't painful to watch.

1004,medalforbenny515,"M. Night Shyamalan makes his ""8 1/2""",2,22 July 2006,"It's hard being M. Night Shyamalan. Year after year, his works of uncompromised genius are poorly received by theatergoers and film critics alike. Even Disney didn't want to make his latest film, Lady in the Water, fearing that it was poorly written, featured too large a role for the writer/director, and contained an embarrassingly self-indulgent attack at his detractors, the crrritics. And as much as I hate to agree with Disney, they were absolutely right.The story, as convoluted as you've come to expect from the man, is not the main problem here. Sure, it's chock-full of narfs, tarturic, and poorly drawn stereotypes, but the larger issue for me was the cringe-inducing self-indulgence that runs rampant throughout the film. For instance, Shyamalan plays the role of an author, misunderstood in his time, who will one day influence a boy destined to become the president of the United States. Self-fulfilling prophecies, anyone? His acting is embarrassing and unintentionally hilarious in turns, and his reactions to pivotal plot points had me longing for the brief, campy cameos of years past.While I can understand M. Night's desire to respond to the unenlightened critics that failed to see the staggering brilliance of his previous works, one has to question the response itself. Shyamalan is multitasking here, attempting to transport his audience through the magical realism of his self-proclaimed ""bedtime story"" while simultaneously denouncing his critics for trashing the gospel of M. Night. In the end, we're left with a fairy tale too aware of itself to fully envelop us and a pseudo-manifesto too delusional and self-important to inspire us in any way. In the end, Shyamalan made a film that can really only be enjoyed by himself. It's just a shame that the likes of Paul Giamatti, Bob Balaban, and Freddy Rodriguez have to go down with the Good Ship Shyamalan.",Lady in the Water
1005,januaryflower,Good Work M. Night!,10,21 July 2006,"While the critics may have slammed Lady in the Water, I have no doubt audiences, especially fans of M. Night Shyamalan, will enjoy this movie.I loved this movie because the storyline was very unique and different from M. Night Shyamalan's previous works. Different is not bad in this case, it's just different. His latest work stars Paul Giamatti and the beautiful Bryce Dalls Howard. If you've seen the trailer of the movie you pretty much know the beginning. Howard's creature, a narf named Stori, has been discovered by Giamatti's character, Cleveland Heep, swimming in his pool. She has come from the blue world and needs assistance getting back to her own world. This assistance includes finding various members of the apartment complex to make sure she gets back safely. Safe from what? Like The Village there are monsters who try to stop her from an eagle carrying her back to her own world.If you've seen all or almost all of M. Night Shyamalan's movies you will notice a pattern of twists. This movie is mostly different in that M. Night himself said there is no twist. The 'no twist' thing however does not necessarily make this a bad movie. The movie isn't totally predictable and it is full of some nice moments and scenes, my favorite being the whole ending sequence, particularly when Cleveland tries to heal Stori and has his own little speech about his dead family. The supporting cast of actors who are not really famous yet also made this movie great, especially M. Night himself. If you've heard bad things about this movie, ignore it. Go see it for yourself and conjure up your own opinions! If you're not expecting a tremendous amount, you won't be disappointed.",Lady in the Water
1006,wahoowill01,Night is now 5 for 5,8,23 July 2006,"At the showing of Lady in the Water that I went to on Saturday, the theater was less then half full. Compare that to the packed houses that greeted both Unbreakable and Signs when I saw those films. What to make of this low attendance? Were that many people really turned off to M. Night Shyamalan because of the ""twist"" at the end of The Village (a movie I liked, by the way). Maybe people were just apprehensive after seeing the mediocre to negative reviews that Lady in the Water has been getting in the media. Perhaps they are put off by Shyamalan's perceived arrogance and egomania. Whatever the case, folks are really missing out on nice bit of storytelling.First of all, a lot of the negative reviews for this film state that it doesn't live up to the standards of horror films. However, Lady in the Water is NOT a horror movie, it's a fantasy. More to the point, it's actually a bedtime story brought to life. The basic story is that a mysterious woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) is discovered in the pool of a suburban Philadelphia apartment building by the building's superintendent, Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti). Heep discovers that she is not of this world, and sets out to return her to her own realm. The scary parts of the story are provided by the wolf-like creature that tries to kill her whenever she is out of the water. Apparently, some reviewers are mistaking this standard fairy tale convention as an attempt at horror, but Lady in the Water is no more an attempt at horror than anything Shyamalan has done since The Sixth Sense. In fact, all of Shyamalan's films, including The Sixth Sense, are better described as ""suspense"" or ""mystery"" than as traditional horror films. The meat of all of his films is the storytelling, and the emotional connection to the characters in the movie. The scary bits are just the gravy. In Lady in the Water, the scary parts are more scarce than in any of his other films, but there seems to be more humor, both subtle and otherwise, than in any of the movies that preceded it.Shyamalan has also been criticized for casting himself in such a large role in this film. While he had cameos in each of his other four movies, his biggest part previously had been as the local man who killed the wife of Mel Gibson's priest in a car accident in Signs. His role in the current film casts him as not only a major character, but without (hopefully) giving away too much, let's just say he's almost Christ-like. Obviously, Shyamalan's critics are having a field day with this one, saying that his egomania has finally taken him over. Would the critics, however, really have liked the film more if Shyamalan had switched roles with Bob Balaban (as a pompous movie critic) or Jeffrey Wright (as the resident who is gifted at solving crossword puzzles) or even Bill Irwin (as the eccentric resident Mr. Leeds)? I think not. If he plays a similar part in his next film, I'll join those who criticize his ego. Until that happens, he's merely playing the role that best suits his vision of the story.In the end, it's all about the story, or rather the Story. That's the name of Howard's character in the film. She plays the part with a wide-eyed detachment that suits this sort of ""outsider"" character. The film is teeming with interesting, slightly off kilter people, and much of the film's surprising humor is derived from the supporting cast. It's the interplay between Giamatti and Howard that gives the film its emotional center though. Despite his looks, it appears Giamatti may make a leading man out of himself yet. The man can flat out act. He played mostly bit parts until his breakout role as ""Pig Vomit"" in 1997's Private Parts. I loved him as Bob Zmuda, Andy Kaufman's best friend, in Man on the Moon, and of course in his lead part of wine connoisseur Miles in Sideways. As with the rest of Shyamalan's movies, it's the slow buildup of the quirky story that pulls you in, but it's Giamatti's superb acting that keeps you there. His scene of emotional release near the end (don't want to give anything away) is truly heartbreaking. You really feel the pain of this man whose life had lost its purpose.The bottom line is that Shyamalan is now five for five in good movies. While The Sixth Sense is probably still his best made film, and Signs remains my personal favorite, this one is right up there with them. His critics say that all of his films stick to the same basic formula. I agree, but I don't feel that's a bad thing. As long as the plot lines and characters remain interesting, I enjoy going into a M. Night Shyamalan movie knowing that it will be done in his signature style. Night has turned out another winner.",Lady in the Water

There is an eery feeling to the whole movie, although it is done with as much love as I've seen in any movie. The story is original, scary, loving, and thought provoking all at once.

The film evokes curiosity, happiness, sadness, humor, fear, and hope. The acting on the part of Giammatti, Dallas- Howard, and Jeffory Wright is excellent. The Score is wonderful. The CG is awesome. And the movie has a very positive moral like all good fairy tales do. I believe that most people who are giving this movie horrible reviews are really just disappointed that the film did not fit into the expectations that they have grown to have for M. Knight's films.It is sad that M. Knight lacks the creative space that all other writer/directors have. Because his most noted films have all had a similar formula, whenever he makes a film that differs from the formula slightly, (i.e. Village or Lady in the Water), it is met by undeserving horrible reviews. People can not step back and see a M. Knight Film for what it is; an excellent film. People always wish to grade his films by a different grading curve. People will give Lady in the Water a 1, and turn around and give Lord of the Rings a 10, and Harry Potter a 9. These are movies of the same genre. Are those films really that much better than Lady in the Water? The Answer is no.

I can see what the director was TRYING to do with the film, but it was obvious he tried WAY too hard. The story of the narfs was completely convoluted and contrived. Shyamalan cast himself in a major role, which I think is a mistake since he is not a good actor and doesn't have a good screen presence. Paul Giamatti's acting was good, but his character was very bland and unbelievable given his past. I could see Shyamalan trying to milk the audience's emotional response at certain points in the film but it felt wholly contrived and fake. Very poor writing.

I've gone into many good movies and come out a bit disappointed afterwords simply because I expected more, and come out of a number of others happy that the mediocrity they achieved was still better than the garbage I expected. I don't think I had heard a single good thing about Lady in the Water, my friends all made fun of the trailers, the few that saw it said it was terrible, and the expectations on IMDb weren't very good either. I saw it tonight almost by chance, picking it out from a list of what I believed were all going to be disappointing or at best average films.Before the film was over I had already decided to comment here on IMDb, something I've never bothered to do before. Usually I feel that those movies worth the time already have enough good reviews for them, but skimming through those for Lady in the Water I find myself disagreeing with even the positive remarks.After those two perhaps pointless paragraphs, I would basically describe the movie as: a delightful storytelling experience, simple yet elegant. The best comparison in my mind to another recent film would probably be Pan's Labyrinth. The people who expected another characteristic Shyamalan twist and the people who expected nothing of the sort were both wrong, he retains his ability to foreshadow without his usual and at this point perhaps even overplayed shocking surprise, instead using it to steer the movie in such a way that every advancement in the plot makes sense without being easily predictable.As I said at the beginning, going into a movie with preformed opinions can alter the after-impression. I would perhaps normally rate this movie a 7, but I'm so happy that I watched it despite all the bad things I had heard during its release that I'm giving it an 8 anyways. Go out and give it a try, even if its not your cup of tea its better than most other recently released rentals.",Lady in the Water
1013,andreg-3,Refreshing,10,20 August 2006,"I'ts good to see a director doing something different. His one of few people that can make a big story seems so simple. It's very clear that he is not only very talented but also a very intelligent man. Well done! The casting was close to perfect, and the acting was as good as i've seen. I live in south Africa and the previews showed this movie as a thriller/horror, well it's not or maybe a little of both, but it's more about telling a story very different than trying to scare the viewers. If you liked signs and the village this one is a must see, but if you didn't don't bother. This time the director plays a bigger role in the movie than before, and i have to say there is a lot to say about his acting skills - very convincing i think he should do more of that.",Lady in the Water

Lady in the Water is no exception to this admiration. It is a thought provoking story that will entice some, while leaving others wishing they had gone to Clerks II where the story would explain itself and its meaning in a simple to understand fashion. The main difference between those who love it and those who leave it is intelligence in the area of analysis. To any who enjoy finding symbolism, this movie is a fantastic adventure of faith and purpose. To any who prefer not to use their minds when they go to a movie, stick with easy stuff.",Lady in the Water

1016,bigpoppa932,Some Scares but mostly Magic,9,22 July 2006,"""Lady in the water"" was relatively fun to watch, but has a few slow spots. It is a magical fairytale of a movie that highlights Paul Giamatti and Jeffrey Wright. If you are a fan of either actor or of Shyamalan, this is a must-see.people who are looking for something deep or artsy will like this movie more than those who just want to be scared. I enjoyed the surreality of this movie, and you need to be on that wavelength in order to not criticize the story. you definitely need to leave your ego at home and come into the theater with an open mind for this film because it is somewhat unrealistic. the CGI is well-done and obscured with lighting enough to blend it in with the set. Interesting camera angles are used in this movie, but this doesn't add much or take away any of its effect. Not many set changes either, so this could have very easily been done on stage with a few special effects required of course. Also recommended: The Never Ending Story, Signs",Lady in the Water

On the path toward reaching her goal, secrets are revealed and frogs are turned into princes.",8,24 July 2006,"After reading all the negative reviews I almost skipped this movie. I'm very glad I didn't. Before commenting on the film, I'd like to suggest this to all the negative reviewers: Let's see you do better!In addition to being very imaginative and creative, M.N.Shymalan is an idealist and a dreamer. Along with his very fresh and innovative story lines, his last three films have also given us an opportunity to view the harsh realities/tragedies of life in new ways, or prays for us to think about making our world a better, more loving place to be.Lady in the Water is an ADULT FAIRY TALE. Anyone who didn't get that doesn't deserve to write reviews for the public. It was not confusing: The parameters of the story were pretty well established even before the story opened. There were also plenty of diverse characters and their developments were sufficient to establish audience buy-in. My only criticism is that I found it moving a little slowly toward the end of the second act, but hey, so did National Treasure (my husband fell asleep!)LADY was mainly very interesting, compelling and thought provoking. (I definitely did not want to leave for more popcorn!) For those of you who like those qualities in a film, I recommend it. I'm glad I was not put off by the nay-sayers. And like THE VILLAGE, I expect to have this film ""echo"" in my consciousness for several months revealing new insights each time. As far as Mr. Shymalan ""NOT delivering another 'SIXTH SENSE,'"" let's face it: That was a rare and wonderful, one-of-a-kind film and we were all lucky to get it. I'm glad he has kept writing because each time we get something very new and different and, besides, at least with his stories, we aren't getting the same old formulaic rehash again and again. ALOHA!

1018,ixineo,Great Experience,10,22 July 2006,"I loved this movie. It had a great story to it. Some people are just too critical of movies because they have broken film making down to a science. I think film making is about an experience. The experience of seeing a film is like the experience of being in love, or feeling triumphant. The way I can tell a movie is good is right at the end. If the movie is over and I don't want it to be. If I wonder about the characters and how they live ever after, then I know that the experience was worth my 8 dollars. I felt that way about lady in the water. The acting was very good I felt. It was not over the top, not trying to hard to be great, it just was. The story was compelling, from the beginning. MNS did an excellent job with this movie. I left feeling moved by the film. I also think that the main character was played very well. Story was a character that was great to watch, especially her evolution as the film progressed. I would recommend this film to anyone. I cant wait to see MNS's next film. This one has made a fan of me. It was a good experience, and thats all I think one can ask from a film.",Lady in the Water

1020,sabian30,Fantastic World in an Apartment Building Pool,10,21 July 2006,"Wow, wow, wow. Mr. Shyamalan really took my breath away with this one. I'm against one person writing, directing, and producing (Mr. Lucas) because I think they need someone to tell them when something doesn't work UNLESS they have a really strong sense of what they are doing, which really, really works in this movie. I have a feeling that 10 people are going to see 10 different things here, but it's beautiful and affirming and really captivates those of us who suspect that there really is a Santa Claus, Tooth Fairy, and sea nymphs that look just like Bryce Dallas Howard (her dad must be so proud!). Bryce is so ethereal that she almost floats off the screen, but I hung on every word. Mr. S has said in interviews that this movie is about everyone having their own special gift, but I think it's about everyone trying hard to get through life. Like this fairy tale inside a movie, it tells the colorful apartment dwellers the quest they are on, but doesn't tell them how to get there or even who they are within the tale. Suspenseful and tragic in places and humorous in others, Mr. S knows how to tell a tale and make it ours. Thanks, M. Knight! Absolutely magical! I figured out the cereal kid early, but still don't know how the Healer knew what Reese was. I may have to go see it again!",Lady in the Water
1021,megalith420,Wow!,9,21 July 2006,"After seeing ""The Village"", I was a little skeptical to see another M. Night Shyamalan movie. I was amazed. The movie ended, and no one stood up. I waited through 20 seconds of credits before I stood up. (God I hope I didn't miss anything).This movie initially comes off as childish, and being made up of very irrelevant mini-plots, characters, and scenes. Thankfully, Shyamalan makes a point to bring it together, ""giving all things purpose"". Its tone becomes a fabulous blend of tragedy and a childhood story that leaves you one step ahead of confused. Stay on top in this movie, or you will be left out...again, everything has purpose. You may feel that he is giving you too much information...I think its because he is trying to mask a deeper meaning.I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys finds meaning in movies, distances themselves from the cliché, and wants to feel inspired.INCREDIBLE!",Lady in the Water

Aftrer Signs and Village I said to myself: that does it! but I made another mistake and paid for this. He should kiss his commercial makers asses a million time a day. they know how to create a false picture from the actual movie. the story is not logical, funny, or even entertaining. This was just a joke. M. Night's acting sucks... God,the worst of the year. I do not know why he insist on acting too. Where I saw this, half the theater was empty and half were sleeping. You should also add very weak special effects and sound quality to the whole package .",Lady in the Water

This is the first time I've seen that happen in a theater and the first time I wanted my money back.I really liked the Sixth Sense; it was a wonderful film, but after that, M.

Paul Giamatti who plays manager Clevland Heep does a great job as he tries to help and protect the Narf Story played by Bryce Dallas Howard (who was in M. Night's recent movie The Village)who has come from the Blue World for an important purpose.

It started when one of my friends suggested watching the new thriller ""Lady in the water"" after watching it's trailer, on that doomed day we went to see it and was the tragedy.The people in the movie didn't seem to object or even disbelieve Cleveland (Paul Giamatti) when he told them that he found an nymph and he's helping her to get back to her world and needs to protect her from other creatures that want to kill her (Which was a wolf made of GRASS, yeah am not kidding ,Grass),the people simply agreed to help him without asking !!! Also,What's with the guy using the newspaper's crosswords to help them solving mysteries and making sure they are on the right path (it would turn out next that his son was the one supposed to do so and he was the real symbolist using a pack of cereals WOW), well i dunno if am the only one who feels this way but that's LAME people. The movie that was supposed to be a thriller turned out to be a joke,my friends were laughing at the cinema,all the people were.even one of my friends suggested that at the end of the movie the Director and the actors should come out to apologize to the audience and saying they tried their best to make it a better movie but they couldn't.

I read all of the negative press when the movie came out and avoided it like the plague after the horrible disappointment from The Village (still irritated by the potential and the let down of that one), but I genuinely enjoyed this movie from the standpoint of pure fantasy. If you try to take it too seriously, or critique the storyline for its realism, or demand some sort of explanation for the supernatural, then of course you will hate the movie. If you loved bed time stories as a child and still enjoy creative fantasy, you will love this movie. Paul Giamatti evokes passion, frustration and emotion like no other actor in film, and brings his best to this role. I think the harsh critics have misjudged this movie, perhaps based on pre-conceived notions that were a result of the marketing team, as the previews and the real movie are clearly dis-similar. For a ""let yourself go"" type of movie, I found great entertainment in Lady in the Water.",Lady in the Water

It is like a Bollywood film in Hollywood settings - the only missing ingredient was a 100 people dancing behind the leads. The only saving grace in the movie (albeit for a short moment), is the satirical display of the critics at the time when the critic is eaten up by the wolf-like thing covered with spiky grass (???!$#@!$#). Don't watch it. Never again am I going to Shyamalan's movies without reading the review first. The movie makes the folktale look pathetic, not to say about the actors. The lady in the water is the weakest creature I have ever seen (Frodo with the ring scores over her). She does a great job of crying her eyes out. The lead actor in the movie looks bored and does a horrible job of stuttering and talking, which he is supposed to do naturally. Overall, don't even watch this movie if you have nothing better to do.

Lady in the Water has simply whet my appetite for more (excuse the pun). Shyamalan's talent is severely underrated & I am disappointed that his work does not have the following it warrants.I entered the cinema with high expectations and was not disappointed. I believe the majority of the audience will take the film for its surface value: ""a far-fetched overgrown bedtime story"". I disagree. Night tells stories. And he tells them beautifully.Shyamalan has connected with his audience & created common ground. Everyone can relate to believing in a fantasy world as a child and it is through this mutual understanding that the story is told. Night makes us want to believe it's true. The political undertones of this film fascinated me. I liked the way Night only subtly touched on them (the television in the background, and other things that I don't want to spoil) and then of course they were brought to the fore through 'The Cookbook'. Night wants us to have faith that things will change. But he also makes us see that humans need to be ""pushed"" before this can happen.It was also great to see him playing a lead character. I hope we see more of him in the future :)Another brilliant movie from a gifted director.",Lady in the Water

I call it boring and one-dimensional.There are no surprises at all in this movie - you can guess it all from the very beginning. After the regular ""cameos"" in all of this movies, the director (Shyamalan) appears in a leading role for the first time... He would have been better off looking for someone else to play his part, but anyways he does a regular job in a poor movie which requires little acting talent...Afters having seen the trailers I had expected an interesting movies with some exciting scenes (somewhat comparable to signs or the sixth sense) but after the what-so-ever-it-was-called wolf-with-grass-on-the-back-monster had appeared I knew that this one wouldn't freak me out at all.All of the characters remain flat - not even the little nymph (or narf to be more precise) played by Bryce Dallas Howard manged to save it this time (as she had done in the village).Not at recommendable...looks as though Shyamalan is running out of ideas!",Lady in the Water

I don't understand the moaning about narcissistic self indulgence, boring plot, ridiculous plot points, etc. It saddens me how many out there lack the imagination to appreciate this lovely, whimsical film.What M. Night Shyamalan has given us is an urban fairy tale that reminds us that everyday life matters, everyone has a part to play in the big picture, and there is still magic in the world. Yes, a child interpreting the meaning of events by observing cereal boxes seems absurd. So does the idea that a fairy godmother sends a young lady to a royal ball and tracking down the mate to a lost shoe ends in happily ever after. Fairy tales follow their own logic, rules, and language. LitW is original, well acted, humorous and delightful.

1035,bmarluse,"Great Film, Tough Sell",8,21 July 2006,"I just got out of this film not an hour ago, and it was excellent. Unfortunately, I don't see major box office success in its future. One of the main reasons for this is misleading advertisement. I'm not sure how I feel about current modes of film advertisement in the first place, but usually it's a tool that helps you develop feelings about the film before you see it (among other things), sometimes aiding in your enjoyment/understanding of the film, and at times hindering it. In this case, there were so many mixed messages in the movie's trailers and commercials, I would understand how an audience member would be disappointed if 'Lady' turned out to be something they hadn't bargained for.The second problem is that there isn't really a plausible mass audience for the type of movie this is. 'Lady' at its heart is a fabulous story told with complete earnestness. It's a real-life fairy tale with scary parts, too, just like real life. Minus the suspenseful bits, it would have been a great sell as a children's movie (tsk-tsk, Disney). The fairy tale story requires too much suspension of disbelief of most adults (people not like myself).Whether you like the movie itself or not, the imaginative story, solid acting, and sheer talent of M. Night Shyamalan cannot be ignored. I'm sure I'm not the only one impatiently his next film, but I'd like to see him do something very out-of-genre for him.",Lady in the Water

Because of the all the bad reviews we put off watching it until tonight. I wish I had not let others influence my decision. This movie is just as good as his other movies, it's just different. So if you are someone who only likes one type of movie or if you aren't imaginative then you probably shouldn't see this movie. But... If you do like movies that haven't been done like this before, or if you want to see an interesting heart-warming movie that at times can make you laugh, then you should by all means see this movie.

For people who gave a negative review to LITW they are bringing in too much baggage while watching it. FOr some reason they see M. Night as pretentious or egotistical because of the role he plays in this movie. To me that is very telling about the people themselves giving the review. M. Night is anything but egotistical in playing the role as Vic, the writer. It was a role made for him. He plays a man who , with his writing, will save the world. M Night is trying to bring back the magic of the movies to the world with his films. Movies in the past 20 years have pretty much sucked. The Hollywood system is nothing but a money driven machine that pumps out sequels and remakes. The system basically stifles creative ideas. The first signs of the downfall of a society is its lack of anything creative in its art. Movies are in a dire need of being re invented.watch this movie like you did when you were a kid.

But I guess if he's going to make a bad movie he might as well put his name on it and spare the original author the pain of admitting it was their idea in the first place.Shyamalan has obviously lost whatever ""touch"" I ever thought he had and I'm sorry I wasted my money and time.

Sure, there were certain spots that were meant to be comical, but it did not make up for the lack of suspense or horror. If the television show Mystery Science Theater 3000 was still making episodes, one could not doubt that Lady in the Water would be easily used in it. The acting is not to blame though.

The commercials would have you expect a horror movie, the site a thriller, and the forums here, a bit of everything. I found the movie to be none of the above. Rather, this movie is a fairy tale come to life, with comic relief making up 90% of the movie. The character of Story is both adorable and endearing, and the acting is actually better than most would have you believe, especially when you remember that they are acting out what Walt Disney would churn out in the 50s - unadulterated cheesiness. Not scary in the least, the movie has excellent actors, adequate effects, and plenty of humor. The only problems that I can find in this movie are Director/Writer related - Corny and predictable plot, and a slight political undertoe, but not bad enough to completely negate the positive effect of Story and the other actors.

Like everyone i was very exited at The Sitht Sense, Unbreakable was a cool story, Sign had a very good style and was scary sometimes. But when The Village came to the theater people began to get negative about Shyamalans work. The blame for that was the trailer, which gave the impression of being a very scary thriller. I liked the movie so much while there were lost of people saying "" this movie is bad"" ""it is not a good movie because it is not scary and the story is boring"". I like that movie so much that i have seen it 3 times in the theater. what I like about his movies is his style: Good characters with their own backgrounds, good music to support the emotions on screen, and one of the most important things, his genre. His movies cannot be placed in one category, its not a thriller and yet there are some thriller moments, its not a drama movie and yet there are drama influences. That is the same with ""Lady in the Water"", there is story that has been based on a Chinees bedtime story ( a myth from China), the story is about a Girl that comes to a certain place to support mankind and after wards disappears. The way how Shyamalan Wrote this and directed it is great and I personally cried at the end of the movie, everything has its meaning and almost every character that showed up had his own part in the movie. For Thriller fans that were a bit disappointed at The Village, i can surely say that the trailer from this movie gives a better view, there are some really scary parts and when Story ( cause thats the name of The Lady) begins to tell about the creatures who play their part, you get nervous and keep wandering when they gonna show up.I am waiting for M Night Shyamalan's new work and hope that it will be the same mysterious style he always uses.Bas Bouwman ( Baarn, The Netherlands)",Lady in the Water
1045,debohun,Much better then reviewed...,9,22 July 2006,"...but for unexpected reasons. This isn't an excellent film, it certainly isn't a Hollywood-type film, or have much box office potential, however it is a truly original story and not the bad film the pretentious reviewers would have you believe. It is totally without formula, and most importantly, it tells a story. It doesn't rely on special effects, unnecessary action, or star power, but actually tells a story, and more importantly the story is a parable with morals about the power of ordinary individuals to do extraordinary things. Yes, it often feels like college experimental theatre, but that is refreshing. The director, rather then typically becoming more conformist with experience, is doing just the opposite. This films feels younger then Sixth Sense, a much earlier work. However it is also rawer, even less predictable, much more complex. Especially for fans of the unusual, fans of magical realism, it is worth seeing.",Lady in the Water
1046,jaaaaakke,A GREAT SUCCESS By Shyamalan!!!,9,23 July 2006,"There have been a lot of hard misses this summer, but Lady in the Water was absolutely INCREDIBLE! This movie combines fantasy elements with real world characters that lead us through an exciting journey. Shyamalan shows his creative genius by captivating our attention through suspense. Lady in the Water was enriched with symbolisms, and deep thought, which is nixed by many critics. Many critics seemingly stereotype this movie as another self-indulging, pretentious Shyamalan movie. However, there is a lot of beauty and raw emotion that was captured by Shyamalan's brilliance. 4/4 stars, definitely the best movie of the summer!",Lady in the Water
1047,ryanbuxton2008,"Suspending Disbelief Is All It Takes To Enjoy ""Lady In The Water""",8,22 July 2006,"When it comes to the high standard that I and many others hold M. Night Shyamalan's films to, Lady In The Water just barely keeps up with the quality. When compared to Shyamalan's other wonderful films, Lady In The Water may not be his best, but it definitely is a great movie.Before I went to see Lady In The Water, I read a few reviews online. Many were negative, citing the fact that the plot changed quickly without much reasoning and the characters never got around to saying ""What the hell is going on? This is nuts!"" But, I was determined to enjoy the film and I promised myself that when I got to the theater, I would suspend all disbelief and just allow myself to enjoy the movie.I'm so glad that I did. Without the inhibitions of ""How are they not thinking this is insane?"", I was sucked in and enthralled by a wonderful, imaginative plot and beautiful imagery and cinematography. I love fantasy films, and this really delivered. The mythology of The Blue World, narfs (narves, perhaps?), scrunts, and the whole thing really kept me entertained.It wasn't until near the end of the film, though, that I found myself yet again marveling at Shyamalan's great skill as a filmmaker. While he kept me feeling as if I was just along for a great ride as I was sucked into the story and imagery in the beginning of the film, he quickly pulled me out of my ""along for the ride"" feeling and brought me into the situation with the characters, asking me to think about who might fit the roles of Story's world. I found myself and the friends that I saw the movie with wondering who would fit each role and how the story would turn out. The great balance of marvel at the film and the active ""detective work"" made for one of the better movie-going experiences I've ever had.Another thing that, in my opinion, makes Shymalan a brilliant filmmaker is his ability to create creatures who have a great presence without overdoing it and making it look cheap or cheesy. A great example of this was in Signs, where the aliens were hardly seen yet the suspense kept me at the very edge of my seat. Shyamalan does a great job in this film with the wolf-like, dog-like Scrunt. He does show us the scrunt quite a bit, but I never had the feeling that it looked fake or ridiculous. There was a misstep, however, with the Tartueks, or monkey-like creatures that keep the law of the Blue World. When they descend from the trees to pull the scrunt away, I felt that they looked silly and almost comical. I think Shyamalan should have kept their screen-time to the bare minimum, perhaps only leaving the last shot of that scene, where the Tartueks pull the Scrunt into the darkness of the trees, which was a great shot and could have stood alone. He made up for that problem, however, with the very last moments of the film. I was wondering how he would show us the Great Eagle coming to rescue Story and returning her to the Blue World without it looking silly as well, but Shyamalan pulled through with a beautiful, excellent shot from beneath the water of the pool, only giving us a blurry glimpse of Story being lifted away. And even when we were shown the Great Eagle flying over the city, it felt genuine and it was a great note on which to end the film.I'd also like to mention how great of a job the gorgeous Bryce Dallas Howard did as Story. She did such a wonderful job of getting so much across without having many lines at all.All of that said, I think Lady In The Water is a great film. It was so nice to allow myself to suspend my disbelief and be sucked into a marvelous picture by extremely talented filmmaker M. Night Shayamalan.",Lady in the Water
1048,rainman01871,Shyamalan is a genius,10,22 July 2006,"This movie is great, without a doubt. It's not made for idiots by idiots. It's made for smarts by smarts. So please if you're not smart, don't go see it and don't post bad messages about it. I highly liked the technical aspects of this film.To me the best scene was when Paul is running to save Bryce; it was done by the camera zooming in while the director moving the camera back, creating an amazing effect--thank you Shyamalan. And traditionally in movies the character who is talking is usually in focus, while the back is out of focus, here, however, Shyamalan intentionally sometimes kept Paul out of focus, while the back was in focus; I thought it was very good.And it makes fun of critics, as you already know, do you? The story is very simple to understand and very enjoyable. Some have argued about the readiness of people who would believe in fairy tales, but they just didn't get the movie (or failed to see the technicality). Shyamalan is suggesting either Paul's character had to have huge conversations with the apartment tenants (this is hinted, but not important to the story), or the characters would believe it, since their lives are horrible, for example, the butterfly lady had a granddaughter (or daughter), but no husband, they puzzle guy had a son but no wife, the war guy had no life--the implication is that they're willing to believe, got it? And I loved the wolf creature, the cgi was excellent. The music was excellent, the acting was excellent, the comedy was excellent, the directing was excellent, therefore the movie--if you understand it--must be excellent, got it? Thank you Mr. Shyamalan.",Lady in the Water
1049,ashley_tikker,Lady in the Water,9,28 July 2006,"I swear, why does everyone compare M. Night's movie's to the Sixth Sense? Yes, the Sixth Sense was fantastic. It was a great movie, and I loved it. But seriously, why do we have to say that every movie Night has after it sucks because it didn't blow the audience away? It doesn't have to have a surprise ending to be a great movie. Take the Village, for example. Fantastic. Gripping. And a marvelous surprise ending. But, oh no, it was too slow. Which part - the great acting, good plot, beautiful cinematography? Holy crap, Night just can't win. Why can't we look at his movies like he's never made one before? Signs, Unbreakable, Lady in the Water - all of which were great movies but got crap acclaim. I'll bet that writing and directing The Sixth Sense was almost the worst thing he's ever done, because he gets no love afterward. So when you see it, why not look objectively? You might realize that he writes and directs one hell of a movie.",Lady in the Water
1050,critter2482,"Good, but without a sufficient climax",6,24 July 2006,"Another good movie from M. Night Shyamalan. I read the bad reviews for this movie before I went into it. I will say that most were dead wrong about this movie. I thought it was a good movie for what it was. Not as great as Signs, or The Sixth Sense, but good none the less. I thought the only flaw in it was the fact that there wasn't a very good climax to the movie. It was very flat as far as that was concerned. Otherwise it was a good movie. Good genuine believable characters, and decent casting. One thing I wasn't expecting was the comedy. I think I laughed more in this movie than all his previous movies combined, very nice touch. I would recommend this movie for others to see.",Lady in the Water
1051,bconklin1,M. Night Shyamalan: Cinematic Genius,8,31 July 2006,"I have been a big fan of Shyamalan's movies ever since I saw ""Signs"" which is now one of my favorite movies. He is so unique in that every one of his movies is guaranteed to make you think the plot through over and over again.However, I must admit that after seeing the trailer for ""Lady in the Water"" I was not very excited, for it didn't seem to strike me as a worthwhile film. But I knew I would go see it anyway in theaters, due to my huge faith in the director.The story is fascinating, and it evolves from an actual legend in the film. The finest element about this movie is how Shyamalan creates a jigsaw puzzle for the audience and the characters to put together. Although the movie starts with a lot of loose ends and is slow at times, it all comes together for a gripping climax. It is suspenseful, dramatic, enchanting, and also humorous at times. It has all the elements of a good movie and requires your full attention to understand it entirely.It also features a great performance by Paul Giamatti and a surprisingly well played role by M. Night Shyamalan, who usually only makes small appearances in his films. To top it off, Bryce Dallas Howard does a fine job.I think the advertising for the movie as a 'fairy tale' and 'a bedtime story' is a turnoff for deciding whether to see it or not. But I am telling you, if you go into the theater with an open mind and don't go to simply point out flaws, you will undoubtedly enjoy the film.M. Night Shyamalan has lots of critics, and you either love him or you hate him. I happen to love him, and ever since I saw ""Lady in the Water"" last Wednesday, I literally cannot stop thinking about it! I left the theater stunned, and I urge you to see the movie no matter what your current opinion on Shyamalan. So pick the next rainy day, and go enjoy a great movie!",Lady in the Water
1052,LadyLupin,I loved this film.,10,26 July 2006,"This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while. Everything that ""The_scandal_cha"" said I agree with 100%. I think that anyone who claims to be a movie buff should go and see this film. Everything about it is incredible. I personally liked how M. Night was in it. I didn't think he could act, but he really can. Go and see this film. Appreciate it for what it is, which is art. Expression. Afterall, that's what real movie are about, right? Not some factory produced cliché, overdone film with no heart. This is probably one of my favourite M. Night movies along with one of my favorite movies I have seen. And, I am a huge movie buff, so ... I have seen a lot of movies. This had a great message to it and I think it would be beneficial for everyone to see this film.",Lady in the Water
1053,mystero-1,"It wasn't a masterpiece, but could have been.",7,24 July 2006,"First off, I took most of the feedback from others as a grain of salt, realizing that some judge of movies can be vague in comparison to older endeavors. That being said, I thought this movie had a great story going for it. M. Night truly knows how to keep the pace of a movie at a steady pace, never to make you look away for a second.The movie follows Cleveland Heep (Giamatti), your normal superintendent, with out of this world tenants. As the beginning progresses, you can tell there will be much character development, perhaps way to many characters for an 1 and half of movie for my taste. Non the less, the big story of the Apartment Complex is about someone swimming in the pool, at night. Note: 7 O Clock Curfew on that pool. Saying that, its easy for you to assume who it was.A lot of the story is Giamatti discovering the bedtime story. A lot of comedy in this movie, mostly the dialogue between him and the Asian women telling the story. M. makes a appearance, which you learn latter, he has a big role in it, more than it seems as first.I liked the movie, I was looking for more of a twist than just a misconception of who the actual Guardian, Guild and Healer were, but I'll take it non the less. I give it a Solid 7/10.",Lady in the Water
