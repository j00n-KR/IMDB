0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very, very good",8,12 May 2011,"The book is an excellent read, while more extensive in its story elements and structure, it is funny, moving and compelling. The movie is also very, very good. I personally would have liked the first half of the movie especially to have slowed down a tad, some of it felt rushed and skimmed through. And while it is not as extensive or quite as developed as the book, it is every bit, if not more so, as funny, moving and as compelling. The whole movie is beautifully filmed, the soundtrack is beguiling, the excellent is suitably adroit and the script is funny, sharp and witty. And the more poignant scenes were genuinely so. The whole cast give sterling performances, Hugh Grant is on excellent form, and Nicholas Hoult is very believable as the troubled boy. Sharon Small, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz also are solid. All in all, a very good film. 8/10 Bethany Cox",About a Boy
1,SnoopyStyle,Both Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult amaze,8,29 December 2013,"Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) thinks of himself as a self-sufficient island. He doesn't need any connections or dependents. He's never worked a real job in his life, living off the royalties of his father one big hit song. After a setup by his sister, he finds that single moms make for the best dating potential. Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) is a freakish outcast at his school, and his mother is suicidal. Will and Marcus are brought together by a lie and a single parent help group.Based on a Nick Hornby novel, it is a comedy about a man growing up helping a boy and his fears. It is a witty film about family and friendship. Most of all, it's about love and the need for human connections. The characters are well drawn. Importantly, Hugh Grant is at the top of his game, and there is a great newcomer in Nicholas Hoult.",About a Boy
2,kosmasp,Quite funny he is,6,21 July 2009,"As another reviewer stated, Hugh Grant is quite funny here. And Rachel Weisz is beautiful and inspiring as always too. But the principal story line didn't really work for me, as it was/is supposed to. While it's obvious that the movie has a boy in it (clue is in the title), it also is clear, that this boy will affect our main character (nothing that hasn't happened in other movies before or will happen in feature movies with a similar story).While a more recent effort has Dwayne Johnson (aka the Rock) in a similar role, this effort with Hugh Grant, tries to stay more/closer to reality. While some might find this very attractive, some others would've loved it to be more comedic. I personally thought, that it wasn't funny enough, but actually liked the first steps. Not trying to fit the bill, trying to escape the blue-print of this movies. Unfortunately in my eyes it isn't really good, but not bad either. Just a nice movie",About a Boy
3,jboothmillard,About a Boy,7,24 March 2005,"Based on the best selling book by Nick Horby, this is a simple but likable comedy from the makers of American Pie, Chris and Paul Weitz. Basically, the story revolves around both rich Londoner Will Freeman (Golden Globe nominated Hugh Grant) and twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), both with no real friends. When Will poses as a single father with a fictional son, to try and woo the attention of single mothers, who he finds very attractive, he manages to have some time with them, before letting them go not long later. As a result of one of his single mother relationships, he meets Marcus, who at first don't really see eye to eye, but after a few more encounters become good friends, teaching each other how to be cool, and growing up. Marcus's mother Fiona (BAFTA nominated Toni Collette) is a big problem in his life, being suicidal, and she does not pay enough attention to him as she could, but after Marcus, with some help from Will, go to the local school talent show, everything is settled and both the boys have each other and others for a happy ending. Also starring Rachel Weisz as Rachel, Isabel Brook as Angie, Sharon Small as Christine, Victoria Smurfit as Suzie and Nicholas Hutchison as John. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Adapated Screenplay, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!",About a Boy
4,tavm,Hugh Grant's About a Boy wasn't as hilarious a comedy as I thought it might have been,6,6 June 2019,"After years of only hearing about this movie, I finally put the DVD on and saw this with Mom. We both agreed that some of the British accents made it hard to understand what was being said sometimes. Overall, she didn't think this was a very funny movie. I, myself, laughed a little during the beginning scenes though I realized that it was meant to be taken a little seriously near the end especially concerning that boy's mother and her occasional depression. In summary, About a Boy was pretty enjoyable but since it wasn't completely what I expected, also a little disappointing...",About a Boy
5,wes-connors,Boys Just Want to Have Fun,8,12 August 2010,"Shallow London bachelor Hugh Grant (as Will Freeman) doesn't need to work for a living as he lives comfortably off the residuals inherited from his father's 1958 Christmas hit ""Santa's Super Sleigh"" and spends his time looking for short-term sexual relationships with attractive women. After a successful fling with a single mother, Mr. Grant decides to set aside his disdain for children and court more lonely young mothers. He invents a son named ""Ned"" goes to an event for single parents. Already good-looking and well-heeled, Grant's invented fatherhood gives him the character needed to be a triple player. On a date, he meets geeky twelve-year-old Nicholas Hoult (as Marcus Brewer). Young Hoult needs a mate to help watch his mum, Toni Collette (as Fiona), who has an occasional tendency to sob and get suicidal. Grant isn't interested in shagging the kid's ""hippie"" mother, but is blackmailed into being a father-figure for Hoult, who has discovered Grant's secret (he has no kid). Eventually, Grant asks Hoult to pose as his son, hoping to score with comely Rachel Weisz (as Rachel). ""About a Boy"" is a pleasant surprise, mostly due to the casting of Hoult, a complete natural, in the pivotal role; he not the annoying movie star kid you're expecting. The film also flatters Grant and its cast, with only Ms. Collette's character being slightly underwritten - we aren't given enough information about her condition, but the actress and story suggest she's going to be okay in the long run. The two supporting youth roles, Natalia Tena and Augustus Prew, are also nicely played. All kidding asides  Paul and Chris Weitz were known more for producing the low-brow ""American Pie"" franchise  which had nothing to do with the 1972 ""American Pie"" hit single  but ""About a Boy"" very effectively uses the Roberta Flack classic ""Killing Me Softly with His Song""  which was originally written about ""American Pie"" singer/songwriter Don McLean  and became a mega-cool ""hip-hop"" hit by The Fugees in 1996 ... connections which are not ""Badly Drawn, Boy""  yes it was John Donne, not Bon Jovi, who said ""No man is an island""  but Paul Kantner added ""He's a peninsula!""The co-directing Weisz brothers, with writer Peter Hedges, do a beautiful job translating the Nick Hornby novel to cinema. It's nice to see filmmakers are still able to make refreshing changes to excellent source material. As the DVD describes, this is a ""lesson about life from a bright, but hopelessly geeky 12-year-old named Marcus"" taught to a ""smooth-talking bachelor whose primary goal in life is avoiding any kind of responsibility,"" with both ""boys"" benefiting in the end. ******** About a Boy (4/26/02) Paul & Chris Weitz ~ Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette, Rachel Weisz",About a Boy
6,studioAT,About two boys really,2,14 July 2016,"While not being one of his three outings with Richard Curtis, this is still one of the films that Hugh Grant is best known for.When I first saw it I instantly dismissed it. Whereas 'Curtis world' is happy and jolly this film actually surprises you by dealing with some pretty heavy issues. The DVD cover makes it out to be much more cheery than it actually is.Grant gives a good performance, albeit one that isn't far away from any other role that he has played before or since. Nicholas Hoult gave his break out performance here, and has rightly gone onto other things.I can't say this is my favourite Hugh Grant film, or even the one he will be remembered for, but it's an interesting enough film.",About a Boy
7,sunwarrior13,Awkward Relationship Between A Boy And A Man,10,13 November 2011,"About a Boy is a comedy-drama or a dramedy film about an awkward relationship between a boy and an immature young man. The film stars Hugh Grant as Will, Nicholas Hoult as Marcus,Toni Collette as Fiona, and Rachel Weisz as Rachel. The movie at times uses double voice-over narration, where the audience hears both Will's and Marcus's thoughts.It was written and directed by brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz and it was co-written by What's Eating Gilbert Grape creator Peter Hedges.which based on the novel of the same name by Nick Hornby.About a Boy concerns the parallel stories of the thirty-something Will, a layabout ""serial nice guy"" living a posh, carefree lifestyle off his deceased father's fortune; and the preteen Marcus,a bright but awkward youth who's tired of his mom Fiona's depressed, boyfriend-less state. Their paths collide when Will, deciding that single mothers are the easiest romantic conquests on the dating scene, fabricates a two-year- old son and joins a group called S.P.A.T. (Single Parents Alone Together). Marcus is wise to Will's scheme, however, and through some incessant pestering and blackmail, he contrives for Will to date Fiona. Though Will doesn't hit it off immediately with either Marcus or his mother, he gradually begins to open up to the people around him -- so much so that he attracts the attention of another attractive single mom.About a Boy is excellent in the sense that it present a coming-of-age stories of a young immature man and a young bright boy through their awkward relationship.This dramedy is fresh and original as it was neither predictable nor formulaic from beginning to end unlike most comedic features.It also uses subtlety in presenting its theme and messages especially about romantic relationships,maturity and one's search for identity in life.Finally,it maximizes Hugh Grant's boyish charisma to the fullest.",About a Boy
8,hitchcockthelegend,It didn't kill me softly.,7,14 May 2009,"Will is self centered and has cast off all his responsibilities. But during one of his more dubious scams to date single mothers, he is forced to reconsider his moral fibre after coming into contact with a 12 year old outcast named Marcus.Adapted from the massively popular book written by Nick Hornby (""Fever Pitch"" & ""High Fidelity"") About A Boy easily translates well to the screen without truly breaking free of the modest premise. Oddly enough for such a British picture, this is directed by an American, Paul Weitz, who along with his brother Chris, brought the world ""American Pie"". It works, largely to the undervalued comic talents of one Hugh Grant (Will). I would go so far as to say that without Grant leading the film, this would have been a flop, all the highlights on offer are when Grant is on the screen. Expressive with his face and delivering his lines with a natural high, Grant nicely lures the audience into the less than admirable Will's hands. Which is quite a trick considering that Will is a morally dubious scum bag!.Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) is OK as child actors go, but here he is given far to much to do. Which is another reason why Grant is so important to the film being a success, he shoulders much of the emotional burden, letting Hoult breathe what life he can into poor young Marcus (worst hair cut on film ever). Solid support comes from Toni Collette and Rachael Weisz, and Weitz's direction is smooth and unobtrusive, with Badly Drawn Boy's score an integral part of the story. Yet as much as I enjoy the film myself, one still feels frustrated that it didn't turn out better than it did. A double handed narration from both lead characters intrudes on the flow of the plot, and the pay off is ultimately an ""oh"" moment. So to me it's an OK movie made into a good one courtesy of one of Britain's best light comedy actors. 7/10",About a Boy
9,jotix100,Boys will be boys....,8,23 May 2002,"I was a bit scared about what kind of treatment Chris and Paul Weitz had given the great novel by Nick Hornby. I have to report they did a great job in bringing it to the screen with the help of the screenwriter, Peter Hedges III. It's amazing what they have accomplished in translating the book to the screen and not lose focus in doing so. A great many Hollywood brains should take note of what was accomplish in this film.Hugh Grant strikes the right amount of hipness, confusion and complete lack of responsibility in his interpretation of Will. He is an actor that brings the right attitude in playing a man about London looking for women, no matter where. He's a prowler looking for women who will fall prey to his charms. Mr. Grant is just perfect for this role.The biggest surprise though, was the amazing debut of Nicholas Hoult, who just bowled us over as Marcus, the ""boy"" of the title. This young actor has a great career ahead of him if the people behind him will steer him into the right vehicles because he is a natural. He gives Mr. Grant a run for his money. The chemistry of their time together on screen is basically what was on the book while we were reading it.Toni Collette plays another mother. Again, her interpretation of Fiona was on target. Rachel Weisz adds beauty to the film as Rachel. Someone should take a good look at this gorgeous woman and perhaps give her and Hugh Grant another vehicle where they can shine once again.",About a Boy
10,lastliberal,I am an island. I am bloody Ibiza!,8,9 March 2008,"No, I am not about to say that there is a Hugh Grant film that is better that Four Weddings and a Funeral, but this comes so damn close that it is scary.Grant was absolutely brilliant in a film about a man who was consumed with his own self interests. Reading today's newspaper, there are a lot more out there like him than we realize. Like the children of boomers, he doesn't have concern for others in the world because he was given everything.But, things do change, Sometimes you open the door to let others come in and you will be amazed. He did it by accident, he fought hard to go back when things didn't turn out the way he wanted, and he finally just opened to the world and started to enjoy life.Toni Collette was also very good in this film by three brilliant writers: Peter Hedges, Chris Weitz, and Paul Weitz (the Weitz also directed) based upon a novel by Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, Fever Pitch).And, of course, any film gets and extra star when Rachel Weisz is present, even if it was only a small role.",About a Boy
11,zardoz-13,Hilarious But Memorable Romantic Comedy,10,15 December 2013,"""About A Boy"" is an amusing coming-of-age romantic comedy that shuns the standard sappy shenanigans. Hugh Grant plays his usual self-effacing character. As the protagonist, he has been cast as a non-entity who only becomes somebody after prolonged exposure to a well-meaning twelve-year old whose mom has tried to commit suicide. Weitz brothers Chris and Paul, who helmed both ""American Pie"" and ""Down To Earth,"" directed this wholesome but hilarious epic about how British people who help people triumph over their problems. The premise that a youngster can draw an older, solitary loner out of his hermetically sealed bachelorhood provides a refreshing change of pace. Grant's character has been spared from the burden of toiling for a living because his late father penned one song, ""Santa's Super Sleigh,"" that emerges as a chartbuster. Actually, Will Freeman (Hugh Grant)abhors the song, but lives off the royalties of his father one-hit wonder tune. Meantime, life for Fiona Brewer (Toni Collette of ""Hitchcock"") has not been rewarding. She earns her living as a music therapist who helps sick children. Lately, however, she has been plagued with worrisome thoughts that prompt her cry rivers of tears. She sends her son, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult of ""Warm Bodies""), to school one morning and reminds him that she loves him. The entire playground ridicules this endearing exchange and Marcus hears everybody utter derisive variations of ""I love you, Marcus."" Marcus knows about the third degree because everybody at school gives him grief. He even gives himself grief when he witlessly warbles songs in class without realizing that he is singing.Will is shocked and astonished that his closest friends ask him if he'd serve as their daughter's godfather. He refuses to capitalize on this this grand opportunity. ""I couldn't possibly think of a worse godfather for Imogene. You know me. I'll drop her at her christening. I'll forget her birthdays until her 18th, when I'll take her out and get her drunk and possibly, let's face it, you know, try and shag her. I mean, seriously, it's a very, very bad choice."" Husband and wife John (Nicholas Hutchison of ""Miss Potter"") and Christine (Sharon Small of ""Driven"") react with surprise at Will's less than subtle response. Nevertheless, they set him up on a date with a friend, Ellie (Natalia Tena of ""Womb"") who has a child. Usually, Will displays little tolerance for children as he emphasized when John and Christine sought to recruit him as a godparent. Suddenly, he performs an about-face attitude reversal and professes no qualms about dating a single mom. He hits it off well with Ellie. However, she decides she cannot continue their relationship and breaks up with him. The idea of dating single mothers obsesses Will. He attends a SPAT meeting; SPAT stands for Single Parents Alone Together. Predictably, Will is the only guy in the group and listens to their depressing stories of betrayal. When it comes time for him to contribute, Will makes up a story that his wife abandoned him and their two-year old son, Ned, and ran off with his best friend. Later, Will lands a date with Suzie (Victoria Smurfit of ""Bulletproof Monk""), who also a SPAT member, and they along well enough. When they go out of a date, Suzie brings along Marcus because Fiona cannot accompany them. During the date, Marcus throws bits of his mom's bread at the ducks in the park pond. Frustrated with trying to pluck off pieces, Marcus hurls the entire loaf into the pond. Accidentally, he hits a duck with the bread and the blow kills it. Surprisingly, this scene turns out to be very humorous. Will convinces the park warden that Marcus hurled the loaf to see if he could sink the dead duck.After the date, when Suzie and Will take Marcus home, they discover Fiona has attempted to kill herself with pills. Eventually, the lonely Marcus becomes friends with Will and Will comes to regard him as more than an obnoxious brat. Initially, Marcus wants to visit Will and watch television with him or he will inform everybody that Will doesn't have a toddler. Later, a recovered Fiona confronts Will in a posh restaurant and demands to know what he has been doing with Marcus. Will defends his actions and points out to Fiona that her son is being bullying in school. Fiona breaks down later and admits that she isn't a very competent parent. By all indications, it appears that Will and Fiona will become a couple. Happily, the Weitz brothers deviate from this thinking. Will winds up meeting another woman, Rachel (Rachel Weisz of ""The Mummy""), and they become enamored of each other. Rachel also has a son who attends Marcus' school. He is one of the students who torments Marcus. Inevitably, Will's lies get into hot water with Rachel when she learns that Marcus isn't Will's son. Apparently, their romance is heading for disaster, but things work out before fade-out.""About a Boy"" is based on Nick Hornsby's novel. Grant imparts all his charisma and Collette plays the mousey mom who lives a depressing life. Scenarist Peter Hedges and the Weitzs have written some memorable dialogue and some of our heroe's observations under his breath about junctures in his life are clever. Mind you, this is a happily ever after opus, but Will and Fiona aren't the couple at fade-out. The finale in the school auditorium where Will accompanies Marcus on a guitar while sings a Roberta Flack tune is fun.",About a Boy
12,evanston_dad,"About a Boy and a ""Boy""",8,5 August 2010,"Hugh Grant shows just how winning he can be, and how he's managed such longevity in his career despite being a fairly limited actor, in this disarming and delightful film.With a title like ""About a Boy,"" you just know going in that there will be some question as to which ""boy"" we're talking about. This film belongs to the long line of movies about childish adults who learn how to be more mature from children who are more adult than they are, but it feels original and like a story worth telling, even if it's been told before.Toni Collette is terrific, as usual, as the mom of the boy and girlfriend of the ""boy,"" and adds yet one more captivating performance to her impressive resume.Grade: A-",About a Boy

14,Sylviastel,Marcus & Will-An odd couple!,8,9 February 2008,"Will played by the dashing Hugh Grant is a single bachelor looking for love in all the wrong places including a single parents' support group where all the other members are women who are not as attractive as he would have liked them to be. One member, Susie, draws his attention even though he falsifies being a divorced parent. Susie brings Marcus, a 12 year old boy played wonderfully by the young actor, Nicholas something, for a day at Regents' Park in London, England. The day ends with his mother's near suicide attempt. His mother is played by the unrecognizable Toni Colette in this role as Fiona, a music therapist who dresses quite like she shopped at the charity shop for her wardrobe. She is always sad, crying, and depressed over the divorce and state of her life. Her only bright spot is the love that she has for her son, Marcus who is afraid to walk in again. Marcus decides to bring Will and Fiona together. It doesn't work out that way and Will has met his match in Marcus, who is an outsider. He comes by daily to watch the show, Countdown, and leaves to go home. He has few friends at school and is taunted and harassed by his classmates.

15,siderite,"Usual Hugh Grant British humour, with the force-behind of a book",8,18 February 2006,"Hugh Grant starts this movie as the kind of guy most people would kill to be like: someone that doesn't have to work for money, ever, has all the time in the world and no personal or emotional attachments other than his breeder sister that he sees only occasionally. He sticks with the John Milton motto of ""Every man is an island"" and feels rather content about it, shagging women as he goes along.In the end, though, he realizes that he has accomplished nothing in his life, that he needs other people and the emotions associated with them and everything ends happily. Or does it? :)The movie is filled with good British humour, sarcastic and powerful, funny situations and the kind of feeling that gets you to smile during the entire film. I do despise the moral, but at least it is not soapy. It is perfect to watch with the girlfriend and even a tight bunch of guys would appreciate the movie.",About a Boy
16,JamesHitchcock,Man and Boy (Contains Spoilers),6,18 November 2004,"Contains Spoilers Hugh Grant is generally associated in the public mind with one particular type of character- the ineffectual and foppish but likable upper-class or upper-middle-class English gentleman, often the hero of a romantic comedy as in 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' or 'Notting Hill'. In recent years, however, he seems to have been trying to broaden is range somewhat. David Grant in 'Small Time Crooks' and Daniel Cleaver in 'Bridget Jones's Diary', although both were drawn from the same privileged background as most of his other roles, were both unsympathetic characters whose outwardly genial nature concealed a selfish and mercenary nature. In 'About a Boy', the film he made immediately after those two, Grant was clearly trying to extend his range a little further. The character he plays here, Will Freeman, is quite open about his defects. Will is in his late thirties but has never done any work since leaving school. He has a private income in the form of royalties from a novelty Christmas song written by his father, an otherwise unsuccessful songwriter who had one smash hit. He lives in a smart London flat and idles away his time watching telephone, playing snooker and listening to music. His relationships with women are confined to brief affairs, because he has a horror of any form of emotional commitment. Hearing John Donne's famous quotation that 'No Man is an Island', Will remarks that he is an island and happy to be one. Although Will has never been married and has no children, he joins a single-parent support group (as its only male member) in order to meet women, believing that single mothers will be easy to seduce. He invents a false story to the effect that he was abandoned by his (non-existent) wife, leaving him to bring up a (non-existent) three-year-old son on his own.He starts to change, however, when he is befriended by Marcus, the twelve-year-old son of one of the women in the group. Marcus's mother, Fiona, is both eccentric and depressive, a sort of latter-day hippie with suicidal tendencies. Marcus is an only child, deeply attached to and protective of his mother, and has grown up a shy, sensitive boy. He is bullied at school by his classmates who see him as weak and 'uncool'. After Fiona makes an unsuccessful suicide attempt, Marcus latches on to Will, seeing him as a substitute father-figure. The film can be seen as the story of how the childish Will learns to be an adult and how Marcus, a boy old before his time, learns to be a child. All the main parts are well played. Although this is not Hugh Grant's most amusing role, it is more psychologically complex than most of his other romantic comedy parts, as Will's character undergoes considerable development. He progresses from the belief that every man is an island to the realisation that even islands can be a part of an archipelago. Toni Collette as Fiona and the lovely Rachel Weisz as Will's love-interest Rachel are both excellent, but the real revelation was the young Nicholas Hoult as the strange and solemn but appealing Marcus. One of the most interesting themes in the film was the way in which it inverted the standard clichés about rebellious youth and convention-bound adults. Marcus attends the sort of middle-class school where the pupils are desperate to gain street credibility by imitating what they imagine (probably inaccurately) to be working-class mores, particularly the mores of working-class black Americans. Lace-up shoes are out; trainers, especially expensive ones, are in. Rap music is cool; Roberta Flack is social death. The youngsters doubtless see their tastes as representing rebellion against adult values, but any rebellion against their own system of values is punished by merciless mockery or bullying. Marcus's predicament is that he is caught between his love for his determinedly nonconformist mother and his desire for popularity with his conformist schoolmates, and Nicholas Hoult was able to suggest both these sides of his personality. Despite some good acting, pertinent social comment and an occasionally witty script, I did not find the plot altogether convincing. I was interested to note that Brad Pitt turned down the role of Will because he found it difficult to believe that a good-looking, wealthy, eligible bachelor would need to lie his way into a single-parent group in order to meet women- interested, because my reaction to this part of the film was exactly the same as Mr Pitt's. I found this whole idea, central to the film's plot, completely implausible, especially as all the women involved had been emotionally scarred by bad experiences with men and would have run a mile from anyone like Will who was only interested in using them for casual sex. I also found it difficult to believe in aspects of Fiona's character; she is supposed to be too poor to buy her son expensive trainers or a CD player, even though she lives in a smart Victorian townhouse in a fashionable district of London. (This is one of those films where differences in interior decorating tastes are used to make a point about differences in character. Fiona's warm, comfortable 'retro' look contrasts with the bare, minimalist décor of Will's flat, suggesting that she is warm-hearted if eccentric, while he is cold and superficial. A similar device is used in other films, such as 'Fatal Attraction' and 'Sleeping with the Enemy').I was, however, pleased to see that the film-makers resisted the temptation to end the film the way Hollywood would probably have ended it, with Will marrying Fiona. Although this is obviously what Marcus would prefer, they are too obviously incompatible to make such an ending plausible. The British cinema is sometimes criticised for its sentimentality, but it can also on occasions be tough-minded. 6/10",About a Boy

Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Hugh Grant, he's got such a charm, I think that's why we can all forgive that little prostitute incident, lol. But anyways, for the most part, Hugh Grant always takes on the same roles for each movie, About a Boy is no exception, he plays a conceited jerk, but this movie put a fresh new twist on your typical romantic comedy movies. It's just always the same story now with romantic comedies, we always have the same guy and girl who fight and fall in love, but About a Boy puts a different look and brings the single mothers in with a guy who absolutely hates kids. Who better to play it? Hugh Grant has that charm to do it and make his character lovable despite his flaws.Will is a single bachelor who is enjoying his life, so much, well, maybe a little too much. His friends are telling him that he should settle down, so they set up him up with a single mother. He hates kids with a passion, but he discovers the benefits of dating a single mother: being complimented on being a wonderful guy, lots of sex, and being able to please the kids easily. So when he goes to a single parent's group, he finds a woman he likes, the woman's friend who has a 12 year old son, Marcus, they all go on picnic together. But Marcus's mother tries to kill herself, so he comes up with the clever idea to get them together so she won't feel so lonely.About a Boy is just in general a good movie, it has a strong story and very good actors. Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult were very great together, I just loved how they hung out together, my favorite scene was after everyone finds out how Will lied to everyone, that Marcus defended him. As despicable as Will was, at the same time, we all do make stupid mistakes and just need to learn from them.

20,MovieAddict2016,"Good, But Took Quite a While to Get to Where it Was Going...",7,31 March 2003,"""About a Boy""Hugh Grant has been considered for the next James Bond according to a certain film magazine. Well, I for one forsee the downfall of James Bond as we know it. The considerations are a black actor, Hugh Grant, Christian Bale, and Jude Law, not to mention another black actor: Will Smith. Yes, you read that right. Apart from black actors--really, Bond being black?--Hugh Grant is probably the worst choice for Bond. But as far as romantic comedies go, he's not that bad.""About a Boy"" is about a childish, whiny, selfish, greedy, miserable young man (Grant) who finds that single parents are best for dating. So he enters into a single parents group, where he proceeds to tell the lie that he has a child. Soon, he is going out with a woman who believes he has a son--who introduces him to a friend's pre-teen, named Marcus. Marcus' mother attempts to commit suicide, and it screws up the kid, so he starts to go over to Grant's home every day after school. Grant eventually admits he has no child, and the woman he had been going out with pretty much dumps him. But Marcus keeps coming over every day. Eventually Grant starts to help Marcus out by trying to help him fit into his school better; he buys him ""trainers,"" CDs, a personal CD player, etc. And then Grant's character meets Rachel (Rachel Weisz), who he proceeds to tell that he has a son, for certain reasons. So eventually Rachel wants to see his son. Trouble. And then Grant gets Marcus to pose as his son while he gets personal with Rachel. Trouble solved. For now.""About a Boy"" is based on the bestselling novel by Nicholas Hornby, author of ""High Fidelity""--which was turned into a film with John Cusack that took place in Chicago instead of London--and a few other hits. I've never read his work, but I think it's been done justice for the most part.""About a Boy"" is a good comedy, with some funny British humor. It was good, but not great. I enjoyed ""Notting Hill"" more, to tell you the truth. I think ""About a Boy"" took quite a long time getting to where it was going. Ranking in at about two hours, that's a bit long for a romantic comedy, especially when the love interest is introduced an hour and nine minutes into the film. The setup itself takes over an hour to establish. Many, many scenes could have been cut to make room for more time after Grant meets Rachel. But instead, the filmmakers take so much time building up to that point, that by the time they finally arrive to the romance part, they have about fifty minutes to deal with a LOT of things that happen. Perhaps that is why the last hour seems so rushed and thrown together compared to the beginning.But it's still a pretty funny film. I'm not especially fond of Hugh Grant, but his romantic comedies can be pretty good--I really enjoyed ""Notting Hill,"" and I don't like Roberts, either. ""The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain"" was also a good British comedy. And there's no doubting ""About a Boy"" is good, but it's not great, and a lot of scenes could and should have been cut. Isn't it ironic that I think one of the deleted scenes on the DVD should have been left in the film?3.5/5 Stars--or 7/10 Stars--John Ulmer",About a Boy
21,sddavis63,"Not Unpleasant, But One Of The Least Pleasant Comedies I've Run Across",3,20 January 2012,"Let me explain. This movie isn't (much of the time anyway) unpleasant; it's just not pleasant. I didn't for the most part find it enjoyable to watch. It has a few scenes in it which are somewhat humorous, but overall I found this a heavy kind of movie. Yes, it's hopeful - in a way. It brings lonely, sad and even depressed people together and lets them build a sort of family connection with one another so that by the end there's a sort of heartwarming scene of a very diverse and eclectic group of people gathering to celebrate Christmas with an extended-family feel, but that quasi-hopeful ending struck me as empty to be honest. There was no sense that any of this was going to last; no sense of permanence. These folks for this point in time were together. Yeah - there's something to be said for that, but for me at least it didn't overcome the overall sombre feel to this ""comedy.""Hugh Grant has never really overwhelmed me. I've never quite understood the appeal he has for many people. His movies are usually pleasant in an understated, silly sort of way, and generally he plays variations on the same character - either the lost, lovelorn single guy or the guy who wants to avoid any serious commitments. He's the same here; although less likable than many of his characters: lazy, shallow, manipulative. Here his character of Will latches on the the idea of pretending to be a single father so that he can meet single mothers. In the course of the deception, he connects with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) - a sad, lonely, bullied 12 year old boy with a suicidal mother (Fiona, played by Toni Collette.) In fact, what really causes the bond in the relationship between Will and Marcus is when they discover Fiona after her suicide attempt. Marcus bonds afterward with the at first less than enthusiastic Will, and the two of them have to sort their way through life and their own relationship - all the while trying to build new relationships with those around them.I have to confess that this just didn't capture me. Yes, there were a few funny scenes, but I never really got the sense of what this was trying to accomplish, and after Fiona's suicide attempt I was puzzled. The single mother of a 12 year old boy attempts suicide, doesn't seem to be in the hospital for long, and then just goes home and takes up her role as a single mom again? In a way, that was really the vehicle for pushing this movie along, but it made no sense to me. There was also the problem that I didn't really like any of the characters - there was a shallowness and a phoniness to all of them. I could admire Marcus' devotion to helping his mom get better, I suppose, but beyond that none of them struck a chord with me. None of this really connected with me. (3/10)",About a Boy

23,secondtake,"Grant is wonderful, but it's an undemanding, if very charming, movie",6,14 December 2010,"About a Boy (2002)This is a pretty straight forward light comedy, well done, with no great insights or surprises. Hugh Grant is the anchor, and he not only stars in every scene, he also provides a narrative voice-over, which is dry and funny because he's able to express astonishment at what's happening on screen.The plot--about a boy, yes, who has a depressive hippy overanxious mother--follows a path through middle class London that might be interesting to Americans for a look at normal life in England. Except of course Grant's character, who is rich by inheritance. Eventually you can see that maybe it is this lazy, selfish young man who is the ""boy"" of the story, because he never quite grew up and the actual boy is more savvy, in some ways, than he is. But this isn't played out as well as you might hope, and the movie ends with a kind of ""all is well in the world"" glow and that's that.Rachel Weicz, by the way, who has top female billing, is a small element in the movie, and a lifeless one. Anyone might have done as well, and many could have made the magic and romance intended come alive better. The other female lead, the boy's mother, is Toni Collette, who plays an unappealing role with total conviction. Completely enjoyable, and welterweight, entertainment.",About a Boy

Watch this beautiful and extremely funny movie and your faith in humanity will be restored,10,25 May 2007,"Will (Hugh Grant) is something of a loner and even that is an understatement. He lives off of the royalties from a hit Christmas song that his father wrote and he does no actual work. Instead, his days are spent in shopping, getting his hair styled, and watching his favorite television shows. But, being a manly man, he does want to connect with members of the female population, from time to time. For goodness sake, though, no one ever better mention the word marriage in his presence! When some friends fix him up with a single mother, Will discovers a goldmine, or so he thinks. Single mothers are more concerned about their children and are more wary about making commitments, which is good news indeed for Will. Learning about a meeting for parents without partners, Will goes off eagerly to the affair, hoping to scope out some nice Bettys. But, unexpectedly, he makes the acquaintance of a single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette) and her somewhat nerdy son, Marcus. By some strange inner intuition, Marcus sees Will as a mate and begins coming over to Will's apartment, spending serious time with the consummate bachelor. But, is Will just pretending to be nice to an equally lonesome young man? This is an outstanding movie, with superb laughs and superb messages. No one could have played the part of Will as Grant does, with great humor and feeling. It is Grant's finest hour, absolutely. Similarly, the rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, is very nice indeed. The production looks swell, with lovely costumes, great London scenery, and beautiful cinematography. Nevertheless, it is the story and script that is most outstanding in accounting for the film's greatness. In fact, you would be hardpressed to find a movie that delivers such big laughs AND such important messages as this one does. It is definitely about time that you, and everyone else on the planet, got a hold of this film, for it is a surefire amelioration of the dismal, daily life splashed across the newspapers of the world.",About a Boy

28,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Redefining classic indie themes of relationship and connection,8,28 April 2010,"No man is an island -- but no film is either. The proverbial happy bachelor who is set in his ways is bound to succumb to the temptations of togetherness and love as he does in every film. ""About a Boy"" does not defy this classic character profile, but neither does it slosh around in clichéd fashion. Hugh Grant's charms and his surrounding cast of unusuals played by fine actors add just enough color to Nick Hornby's touching family story to appear fresh and even revelatory.Grant plays Will, a ladies' man living off royalties from his father's one hit Christmas song who decides to up his game by pretending to be a single parent and going after lonely, confused single moms. This leads him by a stroke of fate to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a pre- pubescent boy whose mother attempts suicide their very first day acquainted with each other. Marcus has surprising amount of self-determination for his age and Hoult gives him maturity beyond his years. Before long (but not without some persistence from Marcus), the two form an odd friendship. Marcus needs a distraction from his emotionally shaky home life and Will find unintentionally that Marcus gives him some purpose and direction.The two will redefine relationships for anyone viewing this film. The proper classification for them would be ambiguous. Will is a father figure to Marcus, but he's also the closest thing Marcus has to a friend as the kids at school have shunned him socially because he's odd, small and breaks out into song unbeknownst to himself on occasion. That said, Will doesn't do any actual things for Marcus, but his presence and attention does wonders.Will's destiny is set from here on out. It's only a matter to what extent he will discover the need for human connection in life, or as Marcus puts in in voice over, having more than just one other person. The script poignantly explores the notion of fulfilling self needs versus fulfilling those of others, while also carefully pointing out that these needs are intricately interconnected.The film is an impressive departure for brothers Paul and Chris Weitz, who co-wrote ""The Nutty Professor II"" and directed ""American Pie."" Teamed with ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" scribe Peter Hedges, the adaptation takes shape nicely. Perhaps they're light on building Grant's character into a truly independent person, but it's easier to like him this way. Better he not be a jerk, which would hurt the plausibility of Marcus looking up to him.As is true of Hornby's work, music is central, and it's especially prominent in ""Boy."" The key turning point revolved around a performance of Roberta Flack's ""Killing Me Softly"" and the soundtrack from Badly Drawn Boy creates a distinct mood. The power of song as self- expression is equally important, as music creates connections between people that are intangible.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",About a Boy

But does it hold up? Will (Hugh Grant) is a selfish 38-year-old man who leads a live of leisure. He lives off the royalties of a song his father wrote so does not need to work at all. One of his big interests is woman and discovers the untapped market of single mothers. This is how he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), a 12-year-old boy with a depressed mother (Toni Collette) and is a social outcast. After Marcus' mother tries to kill herself Will and Marcus are forced into each other's lives and an unusual friendship starts to develop.The winning aspects of About a Boy is a witty script by the Weitz brothers and Peter Hedges and a great performance by Grant. Grant is great playing a selfish, self-centred man thinking only of himself who is forced to grow up and become responsible. Grant has great comic timing through and given good lines throughout. Some of the best moments is the use of narration and when it relations to the actual conversations on screen. There are natural relationships between the characters and the drama was well handled.The rest of the cast was also strong and the Weitz brothers certainly keep the film going at both a steady pace and make it visual. There is strong chemistry between everyone and the Weitz Brothers know where to find a good editor. They also know how to subtly move the camera and use trick to enhance the film and About a Boy is easily their best film.It is not a perfect film like the Rotten Tomatoes scores suggest and the 7.2 on IMDb is more fair. If you do not like drama-comedy About a Boy is not going to win you over and this film has more of a wit then outright laughs. Plus the third act felt very rushed as Will finds a love interest in the form of Rachel (Rachel Weisz, who was underused) and Marcus suddenly befriending an older girl, Ellie (Natalia Tena) when we should have seen more of her. Plus the children at the school and their behaviour did not feel real, it did feel like what real children do or act like.About a Boy is a fair enough film, but it is not quite my cup of tea.",About a Boy

He ""discovers"" single mothers' potential as grist to his mill and proceeds to, mercilessly hump 'em and dump 'em in a most ungentlemanly manner until he crosses paths with Marcus, a needy but canny 12 year old. To me,""About a boy"" had ""Chick - Flick"" writ large all over it (as have all Mr Grant's previous movies),but a light British comedy without Mr Bill Nighy is a rara avis indeed so I gave it the benefit of the doubt and stuck it through right to the rather saccharine ending which I felt gave lie to the more gritty aspects of the movie as a whole. Nonetheless it is - in my opinion - leaps and bounds above Mr Grant's usual metier and overall is a well - acted,intelligently scripted and thoroughly worthwhile experience.The music - by a person apparently called ""Badly-Drawn Boy"" of whom I had previously never heard - is excellent. Even if you have always steered well clear of Mr Grant's work in the past,I recommend that you see ""About a boy"",even of only to watch him grow up just a little.",About a Boy

The way the initial encounter happens is that Will(the character played by Grant)lies about having a son(twice in the movie)to attract single mom's and one of the mom's friends' son(who is the 12-year old mentioned earlier)joins them on a picnic. The boy, played by Nicholas Hault, kind of adopts him and forces himself into the man's life by coming over after school to hang out. They eventually get along but the boy's initial reason for the encounters is so that Will might take an interest in his mom(but that never happens). They teach other other a few things and eventually become attached to one another. Will, never expected this to happen -- since he of course is his own island. This is a simple movie that teaches us what is really important in life by presenting us someone who is unchangeable and then shows them changing. There are a few laughs in the movie, but the story of the boy and his relationship to his suicidal mother and how Will eventually becomes a part of their lives is what makes the movie special. I wouldn't consider this a romantic-comedy but rather a relationship-comedy and the relationship is between a boy and a man and their ability to teach one another to be what they need to be.

Becaise what is it about contemporary fans of Billy Wilder like Cameron Crowe and the Weitzes that they can't bring themselves to be as cynical? At least it wasn't as schmaltzy as the previews made it out to be. The younger titular boy is more quirky and desperate for a father figure and Hugh Grant's eccentric involvement with him is believably gradual.

41,slokes,Isle Of Hugh,8,20 July 2005,"Sometimes a rut can feel like a hammock when we get stuck in one.""About A Boy"" is about a Londoner who was apparently born into one, imprisoned as it were by his father's legacy as author of one of the world's most popular and annoying Christmas songs. After years of feckless unemployed upper-middle-class living, Will views himself as an island, and sees his lack of long-term relationships as a plus. Even offered the simple honor of being an infant's godfather, Will begs off, saying he'd be ""crap"" at it and probably just ""try and shag"" the girl the moment she turned 18.""I always thought you had hidden depths,"" the mother says.""No, you've always had that wrong,"" Will cheerfully replies. ""I really am this shallow.""But of course Will does have depths, and as played by Hugh Grant in a role that gives this smooth comedic actor a chance to showcase some previously-unguessed-at depths of his own, we find ourselves rooting for Will to find them as he finds himself attached unwillingly to a 12-year-old named Marcus, played with welcome non-cuteness by Nicholas Hoult. Marcus, an abuse magnet at school, is alternately worried for his unstable mother and searching for a pal. Will, a 12-year-old at heart, is a perfect if unknowing candidate.Based on the great Nick Hornby novel, ""About A Boy"" walks a fine line, doling out easy laughs and real pathos with deceptive ease. Like Hornby's book, the movie depicts Will's perverse detachment from the world as both delightful and pathetic. Life is a full plate of pain for those who participate, but the benefits, as Marcus tries to tell Will, beat all else.Of course, most of us don't have the luxury for ""island living,"" and the potential of resenting Will, especially as played by that handsome devil Grant, might have been the film's biggest danger. But Grant defuses things with a subtle characterization that downshifts on the smugness and draws on the lost boy within.For example, when Will tries to infiltrate a single-mothers' club as a way of bagging some commitment-free sex, we watch him tell the mothers about his own non-existent two-year-old boy Ned telling him ""you hang in there, Dad,"" then reacting with uncertain fear when the mothers enthuse about how remarkable that is for such a young child.But we also see the pain Will pretends isn't there, in brief flashes as he reflects on the hard-drinking failure his father became after his one-hit wonder, and especially in one great scene where Will finds himself with a woman he really cares about, unable to break out of his artifice at a critical moment. During that scene, and a later, angry one with Marcus, Grant's acting really demands consideration from those who dismiss him as a dandy glamor boy.The directors, Chris and Paul Weitz of ""American Pie""-fame, prove they can make a film that delivers intelligence as well as laughter, and with writer Peter Hedges, fashion a script that takes some clever and daring liberties with Hornby's solid story. I especially liked the one near the end of the movie, but if I revealed anything I'd probably get some Flack for it, so say no more.The very last scene of the movie is a mistake, though, the kind of tidy resolution Hornby's novel and life itself rightly rejects. It's the one bum note in this film, but enough of one to dock it a point with me. Otherwise, I'd have to rate this above even the other cinematic Hornby adaptation, the classic ""High Fidelity."" But this is a very entertaining film, with great set design, a terrific ""Rubber Soul""-style Britpop title song by Badly Drawn Boy, tight editing, and subtle, crafty camera work. Also some great supporting performances, especially Toni Collette as Marcus' mother, who has the film's toughest role (she must be funny and suicidal) and manages to not only pull it off but gives ""About A Boy"" a wonderfully unstable center. As ""About A Boy"" makes clear, instability is a good thing when it shakes us from our ruts.",About a Boy

Will is a hip guy who lives on his own in a nice loft in London, who drives a fancy car, who wears pretty clothes and who doesn't have to work because he lives of the royalties from a Christmas song his dad once wrote, and what's even better for him: he doesn't have a family to take care of... And then he thinks of a new tactic to pick up single women. He'll go to a self-help group for single parents where he, while passing himself for a single dad (which he isn't of course), can meet a lot of young single mothers, all very eager to become his next sexual object. But Will's hope of staying a bachelor for the rest of his life is interrupted when he meets the 12-year old Marcus, a very uncool kid that will eventually teach him how to grow up as he teaches the kid to be cool...In a way this is a very typical Grant movie. I wouldn't even be surprised if someone told me that this movie was written especially for him. And it has to be said, he does a nice job. It's all rather predictable of course and you know what will happen most of the time, but that doesn't mean the movie isn't any good. I really liked Grant as the eternal bachelor and all other actors did a nice job as well. That's why I give this movie a 7/10.",About a Boy

45,valadas,Just a simple story,6,6 December 2009,"Not bad but not good either. It makes you spend about 2 hours in a good mood watching the story of two lives that cross each other at a certain moment: an idle 38 year old man (done by Hugh Grant who is not a great actor, with all his stereotyped facial expressions) and a 12 year old clever and sensible boy (done marvelously by Nicholas Hoult). The boy lives with his divorced mother who suffers from cyclic depressions with suicide attempts and has an odd behavior being (and making her son to be) a vegetarian and having the boy to wear odd clothes and using a hair-do which makes him not very popular at school and the object of bullying by his classmates. The man lives alone and besides watching TV and running about after women does practically nothing since he lives on money that comes from an author's copyright his father got for having composed a song who turned out to be famous. The story goes on smoothly with lots of lies people tell each other, with no particular aim, with the boy meeting the man regularly at the former's home with no other purpose than to fulfill his unhappy life while the man finishes by attaching himself sentimentally to the boy. After reading this one could think that we are before some kind of drama. Not at all. This is a comedy because the situations created are intended to make you laugh and sometimes you do laugh indeed at certain scenes. But in the whole you don't laugh as much as you were supposed too because the story hasn't great funny moments. An almost good movie but just only almost after all.",About a Boy

Probably because of its appeal to a family audience who can all enjoy the story and light humour.For me, the best part of this film is the exceptional performances from Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult, who play Will and Marcus respectively. The relationship between the pair and the funny moments they deliver is what makes the film.The storyline is relatively simple and easy to follow but still manages to be enjoyable and interesting.

50,jhclues,"Effective, Satisfying Film",9,6 June 2002,"Being afforded a life of independent means can be a blessing in some regards, perhaps, but it can also be the definitive test of one's character. If one chooses to use such a situation toward altruistic ends, or at the very least a venture that can provide some personal fulfillment, it says something about who that person is.  On the other hand, if one squanders the opportunity on a totally self-absorbed, shallow existence, it says even more.  And while taking the latter path may provide some interesting moments, it's a cosmetically created, external bubble that serves no other purpose than covering up an empty life, and sooner or later-- to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence-- that bubble is bound to burst; and when it finally happens, when the wake-up call comes, how one responds to it is the ultimate test of character, which is what happens to a such a man in `About A Boy,' directed by Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz, and starring Hugh Grant.As far as Will Freeman (Grant) is concerned, he has the perfect life; he lives comfortably, if not extravagantly, on the income provided by a certain kind of inheritance.  On the surface, at least, he's happy.  Admittedly, however, he's the very epitome of `shallow,' who makes a conscious and concerted effort at avoiding any commitment in relationships, or even attempting to accomplish or achieve anything at all.  He merely takes from life, gives absolutely nothing back and has always been content with it. But of late, his relationships have become a bit `sticky.'  Women are becoming too demanding, the break-ups too messy.  He needs a new conquest, a relationship in which he can flex his shallowness anew, with a woman who will give him everything and demand nothing in return. 
Fortuitous circumstances provide him with just what he's looking for; fortuitous, however, in a way he doesn't realize, as it leads to a relationship through which he encounters a young boy, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).  And it's a meeting that is destined to have an enormous impact on his life, as Marcus becomes the catalyst that changes Will's entire perspective.  For the first time, Will begins to question who he is, and what he's doing-- or not doing-- with his life.Telling this story (adapted for the screen by Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers, from the novel by Nick Hornby) presented a challenge to the filmmakers, in that it's nothing really new; the history of the cinema is filled with stories of individual epiphanies, many along the same lines as this one (recently, `The Kid,' with Bruce Willis, for example).  So a fresh approach and presentation, including the kind of performances they could extract from their actors, was essential for this film to attain any distinction whatsoever.  Which it does, and splendidly.  And, moreover, they succeed on all fronts.  The screenplay is intelligent, and the characters-- especially Will and Marcus' mom, Fiona (Toni Collette)-- are convincingly well developed.  With Will, there is no sudden leap into who he becomes by the end of the film; it comes though a gradual recognition and realization of who he is, after first establishing a starting point from which the character can grow.  The same is true of Fiona.  There's detours and set-backs which-- as in real life-- prevent a direct journey from point A to point B, and create the proverbial sticky wicket along the way.  Weitz and Weitz set a good pace, and most importantly, manage to give their film some real heart without lapsing into any melodramatic, maudlin sentimentality. Rather, the sentiments and situations they express are real and believable, and presented in such a way as to afford the audience any number of elements to which they can genuinely relate.As Will, Hugh Grant gives arguably his best performance ever.  In some respects, Will is similar to other characters Grant has created (most notably Daniel in `Bridget Jones's Diary'), but there's a depth to Will he's never previously managed to achieve, and without question this is his most three-dimensional, fully developed character yet.  Grant has a natural charm and a charismatic screen presence, but his presentation is often tinged with a bit of pretentiousness that is entirely absent here.  He does an especially nice job of effecting Will's transition in very real and credible terms, and by the end, it's obvious that this is a side of Grant we have not seen before; with this role, he has effectively expanded his range as an actor.  In the final analysis, it's a performance with real substance, and it makes Will a truly memorable character.The young Hoult brings Marcus convincingly to life, as well, with an extremely natural performance, in which he commendably manages to avoid the trappings of stereotype into which this character could easily have fallen. Some credit must go to his directors, of course, but it's Hoult who makes it especially believable in the way he responds, for instance, to certain given situations that typically seem to evoke a particular reaction when being depicted on screen (his rather introspective response to the taunts of his school mates, for example; quite different than what is usually portrayed in film).  And in their scenes together, Grant and Hoult strike a chord of reality that finally assures the overall success of this film.The supporting cast includes Rachel Weisz (Rachel), Isabel Brook (Angie), Sharon Small (Christine), Victoria Smurfit (Suzie) and Nat Gastiain Tena (Ellie).  Entertaining, as well as insightful, `About A Boy' gives a truly fresh perspective to an element of the human condition that has been explored before, but rarely as effectively.  The Weitz Brothers make the subject of their film accessible to a wide audience, and in a way that is engaging and satisfying.  This film is going to be a pleasant surprise to many who see it, in that it delivers a whole lot more than most would expect.  And that's the magic of the movies.  9/10.",About a Boy

52,Stampsfightclub,Great Grant in awesome About a Boy,9,3 January 2009,"Middle aged bachelor Will (Grant) gets more than he bargained for when he meets Malcolm (Hoult) a young lad who wants a partner for his suicidal mum.Hugh Grant, the romantic guy of the nineties. You may ask what makes About a Boy different from every other romance films. Why should you spend time watching a film that could easily be a repeat of another one of his flicks? With his roles in films such as Four Weddings and a Funeral and Love Actually, his characters were always chasing the girl but there is more to Will than these stereotypical parts. He is not Prince Charming. He is not a babbling geek. He is a git. A man with no regard for anything but himself. Grant has made Will the man any viewer would love to hate.But yet he manages to be unbelievably funny and charming, and you can't help but love him. Grant here has shed that everyday lovable loser who can't commit into a man with personal baggage and an agenda. Juxtaposed with Nicholas Holt and you have a fine on screen duo.Little would we know that the lad playing Malcolm would become a teenage hero in award winning teenage gritty drama Skins. This well thought out debut performance puts faith back into the future.The stereotypical geek protagonist is ridiculed too often by picking up on media conventions such as computers, glasses and vast knowledge etc. But there is a spin here because Malcolm is called a geek because of his appearance. The baggy hippy clothes, the bowl haircut and the solo singing make him an outcast and he is labelled a geek for it and here we explore the depths of his character and though he is portrayed as a geek on the outside he is a child wanting love on his inside, a fine representation. This sentimental technique which some may find obvious but undeniably rightful.Sounds cheesy right? Wrong. This Nick Hornby adaptation is far from it. Unpredictable, consistent, funny and without resorting to clichés and slapstick humour creates a sharp originality. The script also preaches through strong real life issues including growing up, suicide, bullying and loneliness. About a Boy is not afraid to get its messages across.Though Grant and Hoult are the stand out stars, Toni Collette (Little Miss Sunshine) gives a knockout supporting role as Malcolm's mother.About a Boy is a fine real romantic drama that preaches through hidden messages and delivers through some stand out performances.",About a Boy

54,gbheron,Surprisingly Enjoyable Flick ****Spoilers****,8,8 September 2002,"I see more than my fair share of romantic comedies. If I were single, they might comprise 5% of my move selections. Thanks to my spouse, they approach 50% (or seem to). Usually they're watchable, but usually not distinctive, and rarely daring. ""About a Boy"" although not daring, is truly distinctive, a gem for the genre. And, in starring Hugh Grant, this caught me completely by surprise. Grant plays Will, a ne'er do well Londoner living off his father's music-writing royalties. By his own admission, he's a lazy, caddish womanizer. That's fine by him. In order to meet vulnerable young women, Will joins a single-parents club, manufacturing a tale of single-parent male martyrdom.  In the course of events, he's found out by the 12-year-old son of another club member, who blackmails Will into becoming his surrogate father. Although ""About a Boy"" has its requisite amount of political correctness, it's not blatant, but woven into the texture of the movie. It doesn't drag the story down with polemics. And the characters are not all a happy bunch, some are profoundly sad.  Nevertheless, in the end, it does follow through with the requisite 'happy ending', although maybe not the one you'd expect. Bottom line: I highly recommend this movie.",About a Boy
55,jon.h.ochiai,You need backup,10,30 May 2002,"""About a Boy"" from directors Chris and Paul Weitz is the best movie of the year so far. It is a bold romantic comedy that has something to say, and whose transformation of it's lead character, Will, played by Hugh Grant in perhaps his best work, is so satisfying and touching. The screenplay by Peter Hedges, Chris and Paul Weits, based on the novel by Nick Hornby is smart, funny, and politically incorrect--which I love. Hedges and the Weitzes take on such topics as single parenting, suicide, and school peer pressure with an edge and always a sense of humor. Hugh Grant plays Will, 38 years old, single, and does ""nothing"" for a living. He watches TV, drives around in his Audi TT, and has vapid relationships with beautiful women. He lives off the royalties of a song that father wrote years ago. He tells two of his friends who want him to be their daughter's godfather, ""Yes, I really am this shallow."" Contrary to John Dunne or is Jon Bon Jovi... Will ""is an island"". He maybe shallow, and he is having a grand time. Will even stumbles upon a new dating community: single mothers. That's how Will meets 12 year old Marcus (played by an excellent Nicholas Hoult). Will goes on a picnic with a single mom who is looking after Marcus. Marcus wears dreary clothes, and sports a bad haircut. Marcus is everything that Will is not, uncool and possessing depth of character. Marcus's mom Fiona (played by Toni Collette) attempts suicide and ends up in the hospital for a spell. Then it occurs to Marcus that having two people are not enough (i.e. he and his Mom). What happens when one is gone? You need back up. Marcus is smart. The back up is Will. Marcus invites himself over to Will's everyday. The beautiful thing of it all is that Will really doesn't change all that much. He teaches Marcus about being cool, and Marcus teaches Marcus about having integrity, and ultimately doing what is important. This is put to the test when Will meets an awesome single mom, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz), with whom he would like to spend his life, and asks Marcus to pretend that he is his son. ""About a Boy"" is about ""No man is an island."" Life is funny, sad, and inspiring all at the same time. What's valuable is a sense of integrity and community. The end of the movie is sentimental and truly heart felt. Hugh Grant gives a stellar performance. He is so believable as the guy who really doesn't care about people, and finally gets that people are the only important thing. This is something that I relate to totally. Grant plays it smart and uncompromising which makes poignant Will's fall and triumph. This is Grant best work. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus is just perfect. He is so natural, and captures a young boy's suffering and joy. Hoult makes believable Marcus's wisdom which he teaches by example to Grant's Will. Toni Collette is great as Marcus's mother, who finally gets a clue. Rachel Weisz's Rachel is perfect as the woman Will falls in love with.Also kudos for the movie dealing with suicide and it's cost with an uncompromising edge, a sense of humor, and compassion. ""About a Boy"" is truly awesome work by all involved.",About a Boy
56,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A fairly unique romantic comedy that screams early-2000s.,7,14 March 2020,"It's challenging to define the aesthetic of the early 2000s, but I think About a Boy (2002) is about as close as it comes. From the music and style to themes and plot, About a Boy is a solid little romantic comedy that probably hasn't aged as well in the time since its creation. Although it is a rare sight to see Nicholas Hoult in one of his earlier film roles, knowing the kind of actor he has become (for such movies like X-Men: First Class (2011), Warm Bodies (2013), and The Favourite (2018)).I'll admit that Will (Hugh Grant) is a bit of a creeper for going after single mothers as a way to hook up and get dumped without the guilt being on his side of the equation. However, the independently-wealthy status he has based on royalties from a single one-hit-wonder seems a little implausible. Still, maybe it was possible back at the start of the millennium. The real core of this film is how Will is able to grow up a bit and show some significant character development brought about by Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).In the end, there's a bit of fun here and there, and the story is certainly unique enough not to be comparable to anything else out there in the genre. It's not necessarily great cinema, but it's not entirely bad either. It's entertaining, and that's definitely something if you want to pass the time. Despite some of the predatory ways Will pursues women, the film still holds up reasonably well almost two decades later. The music is catchy, and the writing is superb (helped out by the talent of Peter Hedges). For some reason, I've had this movie on my watch list for a long time, and I'm glad I finally got around to seeing it.A fairly unique romantic comedy that screams early-2000s, I give About a Boy 3.5 stars out of 5.",About a Boy
57,Rogue-32,Can I give this one an 11 ??!,10,27 May 2002,"About a Boy is one of the best films I've ever seen, plain and simple, and it is the best performance Hugh Grant has ever given -- quite possibly the best performance he might EVER give. His impeccable comic timing has never been more brilliantly utilized; in fact, everything he's ever done up until this point has been, it seems, a preparation for his role in this film. 
Beautifully written and realized to perfection, this movie about accepting the human need to love and be loved finds the right tone from the beginning and manages to carry it through to the very end. It's indecently witty, humblingly perceptive, extraordinarily moving, and above all, REAL - there is not a single moment in the film that does not ring true.  And it never gets too cutesy or corny or - most amazing of all - heavy handed.  From the second it begins until the credits are rolling, this film WORKS.  Peter Hedges and the Weitz brothers, who were involved in another film I love, Chuck & Buck, have written a truly remarkable screenplay based on Nick Hornsby's novel (which I haven't read but I definitely will now), and they direct this film with confidence, grace and intelligence, getting magnificently authentic performances from the cast.  Nicholas Hoult in particular is - I am running out of adjectives - superlative as Marcus, the boy who 'adopts' Grant's character Will, and Toni Collette has never been more effective. I especially loved (minor spoiler alert) how Grant's and Marcus' characters each had their own narratives going, relating their respective points of view of what was happening - this plot device works brilliantly, adding a remarkable dimension of clarity to the film.

The Core cast have proved their worth and I was surprised to find the directors are 2 Americans who's careers are chequered to say the least. But the direction on this film is impeccable, with each character delivering miles more than lines off a script. There are so many layers to them you stop seeing Hugh Grant, Toni Collette and Nicholas Hoult and lose yourself in the story and characters, and that's quite a feat considering how well we know Hugh's face.
Special note to Nicholas Hoult who's character deals with so much weight on his shoulders from his suicidal mother to school bullying to battling his own oblivious innocence. His reactions and actions are grounded and insightful. Beautifully written and acted.

59,FilmOtaku,A surprisingly touching film,7,14 July 2003,"I don't have to tell you that life is full of surprises.  However, despite its very definition, I was not prepared for the surprise I had while watching this film.  Perhaps it is because I went into it expecting to hate it, but because of my New Year's resolution to try to be more open-minded in my film viewing I decided to give it a shot.  (That doesn't mean that I am about to watch anything involving J. Lo or Sandra Bullock  a woman has her limits) But I'll tell you why I expected to hate it:  My grandmother and aunt loved it.  Absolutely nothing against their taste in films, but I've generally learned that I will never accept Meg Ryan as my personal savior, and they will never worship at the altar of Stanley Kubrick.  So I went into About a Boy with trepidation, but I went into it.What a wonderful choice, because it is an amazing film.  While under the guise of a comedy, it examines some very compelling issues, and treats them seriously.  Hugh Grant, who I feel has not done a decent film since Four Weddings and a Funeral, is brilliant in his portrayal of Will, a guy who has no idea what he wants in life and is one step worse than shallow:  He readily acknowledges his shallowness.  Newcomer Nicholas Hoult is endearing as Marcus, the 12 year old boy Will begrudgingly takes under his wing. (This kid also has the most interesting eyebrows in cinema right now)  Toni Collette rounds out the main cast as Marcus' depressed mother, a woman whose fragility is painful to experience through the eyes of her son. 
In terms of the story, the theme of `finding oneself' is certainly not new to cinema, but About a Boy addresses it in such a charming manner that even this extremely cynical viewer was drawn in immediately.  I watched this film (as I do most films) by myself, and was actually disappointed when I had to immediately interact with friends after seeing it because it's subtle profundity made me want to sit and reflect upon it.Although I generally don't like the actors involved, I don't normally `do' touching comedies, and About A Boy is the first Nick Hornby book I wasn't able to get through, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, so that makes this a great film in my eyes. And for once this is a movie that I can pretty much recommend to anyone.  So what do I think of praising a film my grandmother loved?  I'll tell you once I get the sound of the four horsemen out of my head it's so distracting.  ---Shelly",About a Boy

So he must know a few things about living life as a fake.While a fine writer, able to write well about small things, he is also light and throwaway. More like superior journalism than great novel writing, although always entertaining and down-to-earth.Grant can't really act, merely do variations on himself. Here he is a bit more like the real person, no stumbling and bumbling and tripping over his own feet, but somewhat languid. While pleasant company he makes a lot of his nice face, foppish hair (here cut short and spiky) and upper class accent.(Most English actors have come from the stage and have a range of tricks: while Grant has - somehow - grown up on film. Nearly always cast as himself.) This is a film of small jokes and situation comedy. Running gags about the one song from which he lives (Santa's Magic Slay) and the empty tedium of his life abound, but I don't believe him. People don't volunteer to tell other people that they do nothing, they create professions (such as ""investor"") which they don't spend many hours doing. Equally the idle rich are not islands, they hang around with other members of the idle rich.The film tries to not to go down the road of the obvious, the child who he befriends (or more accurately befriends him) is ordinary. If this was an American film the kid would be blonde haired and blue eyed, not so here. Naturally we are on a journey, if only towards fashion headgear and a better haircut.Where is the Grant character on a journey to? That there is a life beyond daytime TV? Did he need to meet a child to learn that? Surely not. And where does the character go after this film ends? A slightly modified version of the same? The film goes beyond the book in having a school concert in which Grant tries to save the day. Is this the best they could come up with? Character pieces are hard to end, but this is just an unpleasant pile-on-the-agony experience for everyone. Overall, hard to dislike this film because everyone is working hard (and the music - from Badly Drawn Boy - is good too), but the sights are so low that it is barely a TV movie and I am not surprised they are making this in to a TV series.

However, as a story, it was nothing special or original. It's not the typical romantic comedy; it is romantic comedy with a twist. Hugh Grant's character is too immature, and the little boy is too mature at the point where he is 'uncool' and bullied at school.

Whilst at first charming, Grant's characters had become tiresome in my opinion.2) I felt uneasy at some scenes where Fiona Brewer's (Toni Collette) mental health issues were joked about.I am sure it was the intention of the film makers to do this. Perhaps it's just an observation I have.Freeman enlists in a single parents support group to get potential 'dates'.One such single mother he meets at the group, Suzie has a troubled best friend Fiona Brewer. Whilst not particularly finding her attractive physically or mentally stimulating. She does have mental issues leading to a suicide bid.She also has a young teenage son Marcus who unwittingly befriends Will who shows him an alternative to his mollycoddled life with his caring (but troubled) overprotective mother.Bachelor Will who does nothing now is doing something.

63,RonellSowes,Wry And Definetly Above Average,8,7 October 2021,"While it may sound counterintuitive, some of the most likable characters(at least to many viewers) are jerks. Those that are selfish and mean spirited to just a point that they can be amusing but not unpleasant. Jack Nicholson and Tom Cruise have both built careers on these characters, they're probably the two best, however Hugh Grant proves himself in this film to be right with the best of them. And his performance as a riotously self-serving character honestly is not only his best, but about as funny a one as you'll find.I guess you could write off most of the comedy in this movie as a British sense of humor, but wherever its culturally derived it's: wry, a little dark, witty and pretty different than what you'll find in most mainstream comedies. Which makes sense, because About A Boy isn't very typical and in fact, superior to much of its comparables.",About a Boy
64,Superunknovvn,"Wonderful book, wonderful movie - gotta love Nick Hornby!",9,7 March 2004,"This movie really came as a surprise to me. I had read the book shortly before I saw it and when I heard Hugh Grant was going to star and the Weitz brothers were chosen to direct I didn't exactly have high hopes. I thought ""American Pie"" was funny and all but this kind of story demanded someone more mature, someone clever. This movie, however, turned out to be all that: mature, clever, witty, sensible, honest and, most of all, really funny in such a natural way. Hugh Grant has never been better in any role before or since and the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is just perfect for the movie. The only thing they overdid a little was Toni Collette's character. I've never seen a person like that in real life. What I did like was the way they changed the ending for the movie. Usually that's not a good idea but it totally worked here. After all, I still liked ""High Fidelity"" a tiny bit better (the movie, not the book), but ""About A Boy"" comes very close. If you are just as much a fan of this book/movie as I am, get the DVD. There are wonderful deleted scenes on it, which are as funny as the rest of the movie.",About a Boy

I haven't read the novel and didn't hugely enjoy the film but I appreciate that some people might. Hugh Grant was great and Nicholas Hoult as the boy in his breakout role was really quite good at acting. There's a lot of depth to both of these characters and Grant has a natural boyish charm and is difficult to dislike, a performance with class.6/10: I wasn't a huge fan of the plot and I feel like the film is rather forgettable but is good nonetheless",About a Boy
66,Geeky Randy,Undeniably entertaining,8,3 January 2015,"This adaptation by Brothers Weitz of the Nick Horny novel of the same name is a very refreshing comedy-drama that successfully uses a double voice-over narration, one of a man who hasn't quite grown up (Grant) and the other of a boy who has to grow up too quickly (Hoult). Toni Collette received several nominations for her supporting role, but the substance of her character is not quite apparent; while Rachel Weisz's subplot comes together and undone a little too easily. If this film were set during 1993–1994 like it was in the book, the overall story would have had more significance. Still, while a little too modern for its own good, ABOUT A BOY is undeniably entertaining (and even, ugh, a little cute) and without a doubt worth remembering.*** (out of four)",About a Boy

Hitherto, Grant's performances have been fine--- but always a bit theatrical ( but-- DUH-- we see him in a movie THEATER, so that's OK!). I never had the sense that his characters were anyone I'd ever actually meet, or even want to meet, particularly. This movie, however, kind of like last year's ""Diary of Whosis,"" may be signaling a departure for this actor. The character he plays here is actually someone I'd like to know (not literally, not the actor, but the vibe, the kind of person). I really enjoyed and admired this new Hugh Grant (note that the Bridget Jones' ""New Hugh Grant,"" while different from the old bumbler, wasn't as folksy-friendly-admirable-likeable as this character).Rachel Weisz is a total babe, and Toni Collete played the PERFECT hippie lady. I KNOW her!!! (You know what I mean). I know dozens of old hippie ladies EXACTLY like Collete's character, and her whole scene. And this whole scene wasn't presented as satire, or for laughs. The writers/directors seemed to have genuine respect and affection for those folks (and they see, in a kindly way, the inherent humor in their anachronistic nerdiness, too).Please don't make me say it--- OK, I'll say it: This movie is heart-warming. It MEANS something. I LOVE this movie. It is a definite ""10"" out of ""10.""",About a Boy
68,lawprof,Excellent Film DANGEROUS to Children's Health!,8,17 May 2002,"This PG-13 film features, totally unnecessarily, scenes with Will (Hugh Grant) puffing away on cigarettes with his twelve-year-old friend, Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), sitting next to him.  The Merchants of Disease no doubt are happy to reinforce in young minds that suave and cool guys (and gals too) smoke.  I was disgusted.*****Hugh Grant brings to ""About a Boy"" depth to his role as a man with neither an employment history nor a need for one thanks to an inheritance.  He proclaims with true insight that he is shallow and for much of the movie he demonstrates that quality.  His interests are totally hedonistic when they are not simply lazy.  Women are objectified for their sexual availability - he is amazed if they look for anything else in him.Of course that state of affairs can't continue and through a bed partner-hunting machination he becomes acquainted with Fiona (Toni Collett) and her very smart but out-of-the-loop with his peers kid, Marcus.  Credit is deserved for making Fiona, a single woman beyond the verge of a nervous breakdown, the unattractive and disturbed mess she is - there's no hint of glamour behind the neuroses, the usual cinematic depiction.  Toni Collett is believable, moving.No surprise that Will begins to discover, through Marcus, qualities he never thought he had in him.  Actually, he never did.  What is unfolded is the birth of a New Man.  What saves the story from being pedestrian is that Grant goes beyond his earlier patented portrayals of the vulnerable and confused male to engage in real and believable character development.  And his meeting Rachel (Rachel Weisz) has more reality to it than his earlier smooth but solely sex-directed hunting of beautiful women.Marcus is more than a catalyst for grownup transformation - he learns from Will without viewing him as an infallible role model (which he surely ain't).  Nicholas Hoult is wonderful in this role with shaded emotional nuances appropriate to both his unstable domestic life and the pressures any bright kid experiences at school when he's out of synch with the ""crowd.""Two serious bothersome points.  The first is that this story perpetuates the all-too-frequent movie story line about kids who choose to or feel they must undertake the role of helping their parents and other adults deal with very serious problems that are, in reality, never rightfully a child's burden. Marcus's maturity and commitment are admirable in the film but in reality a child in his situation probably wouldn't see a very happy resolution and might well feel responsibility for failing in his/her mission.  In movies, of course, the kid usually succeeds.  I can see kids from single parent homes watching this film and feeling either inspired to emulate Marcus or disturbed that they can't.Secondly but connectedly, ""About a Boy"" trivializes serious mental illness. It isn't done intentionally but if people could overcome their dangerously real depression through just meeting new people and enjoying good food, a lot of doctors and therapists could close their practices and go to law school.",About a Boy
69,WriterDave,"The ""Fight Club"" of Romantic Comedies",8,19 March 2003,"Think about it. Instead of going to support groups and lying about illnesses like Ed Norton did to combat his boredom in ""Fight Club,"" Hugh Grant lies about being a father and goes to a single parent's support group to pick up hot single moms and cure his boredom. These are symptoms of the same disease. No man is an island. In the end of ""Fight Club"" Ed Norton realizes that no amount of consumer goods, cathartic violence, mayhem, and bloody male bonding can make up for the fact that what a man really needs is a good woman. He tells Marla at the end of the film while watching buildings explode ""You met me at a very strange point in my life."" Likewise, in the end of ""About a Boy"" Hugh Grant realizes that no amount of material things and solitary comforts can take the place of the friendships and meaningful romantic relationships that are needed to live a happy life. Both of these men were living in compartmental, single serving, units of time, worlds that were empty and void of meaning.Okay, the ""Fight Club"" comparisons aside, this was a surprisingly charming and astute romantic comedy with a biting wit and deft sentimental touch. I hadn't been this pleasantly pleased by such a lightweight film since Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous."" This is by far Hugh Grant's best performance to date, and this is a rare comedy that has some emotional depth and uplifting things to say about human relationships. What makes this even more surprising is that this came from the Weitz brothers, who previously gave us the only marginally funny and excruciatingly immature ""American Pie"" films.

But, surprise, surprise! The film is a delight. Well-made, a terrific cast and the part of a lifetime for Hugh Grant. (To really see this man's range, rent the excellent ""Impromptu"" where he plays classical composer, Chopin) He makes the self-centered, immature character of Will so fleshed out, three-dimensional and interesting that you truly care about the guy - even though he does some awful things.

As much as I tried, I couldn't see it, until my wife made a comment that suddenly made it all clear for me. She said:'The viewers are happy because now Will has also become a loser like everybody else...'Of course, that's it, Will is hated by the viewers because he personifies all that they always wanted to be but couldn't. The viewers are jealous. So when by some mystic force he discovers that being 'normal' is the essence of life and happiness and transforms himself from being charming and successful into a regular everyday loser, people love it!

77,DavidSim240183,A true Hugh performance,7,30 March 2008,"A common theme that runs through much of Nick Hornby's work is that of a shallow man on the road to redemption. Its a theme so beloved of Hornby there are times when I wish he would change his act. About a Boy is very much the same kind of story. The novelty is that instead of a woman providing the catalyst for change, its a child. And while the film version is not an altogether successful translation of the book, it captures much of the novel's spirit, and contains two very good performances from 13 year old Nicholas Hoult and a surprisingly good Hugh Grant.I must admit to not being a particularly huge fan of Hugh Grant. He's certainly one of Britain's most overrated actors, where other more talented Brits like Clive Owen are constantly overlooked. Yet when Owen is given the chance, his acting ability leaves Grant's in the dust. I just don't care much for Grant's purely one-note style of acting. The stumbling, foppish cad who bumbles his way towards a happy ending. The only time he ever impresses is when a director casts him against type. Usually roles where he's well aware of his shallowness, and not blissfully unaware of it, like Bridget Jones's Diary (his finest hour) and About a Boy.Will Freeman (Grant) is the man most teenagers idolise. A man who is comfortably well off, has his pick of any woman, and never has to do a lick of work. Marcus (Hoult) is the teen most people wish they were at 13. Someone who is intuitive and attuned to the world around him. But as a consequence he's an outcast, socially inept and equally maladjusted.These two disparate souls are brought together through sheer circumstance, and the more time they spend with one another, the more they learn from one another. In essence, Will learns to grow up. And Marcus learns to grow down!About a Boy is a film that is almost astonishingly faithful to its novel. About three quarters of the book are exactingly redone for the big screen. It's held onto the character's interior monologues, having two narrators at the same time. In fact the filmmakers reverence for the book is such that sometimes the dialogue is almost indistinguishable. Its really only at the end that the film diverges from the path the novel laid out in favour of a Hollywood style happy ending (no doubt Universal's influence).The success of this story rests on the ability of its cast to pull it off. Hornby's dialogue (he's credited as one of the film's writers) is typically pithy and ironic, but what works on the printed page doesn't always work on screen if the actors aren't up to the task. And I'm happy to say Grant and Hoult are.Hugh Grant is always so much better when he's gleefully aware of his character flaws and doesn't give a damn. Will is a character that is almost tailor-made for Hugh Grant. A man who achieved success in his life (through no effort of his own) and is perfectly comfortable with the life he chooses to live. No responsibilities. No cares. No worries. Grant has an absolute ball in the role of a womanising layabout who coasts by on the hard work of others.But more importantly, Grant is equally (not to mention surprisingly) successful at convincing us there is a more vulnerable soul behind Will's cynical exterior. As he becomes more immersed in Marcus's problems at school and at home, he slowly begins to realise his own life is not so great either. He lives off the royalties of a song his dad wrote. Will never has to work because of someone else's accomplishments. And he slowly begins to realise his life means nothing to nobody. The shock is that Grant actually makes you feel for his plight.But as good as Grant is, newcomer Nicholas Hoult is even better. He does a great job communicating the conflicted feelings of a young man much smarter than those around him, shunned by his age bracket because of it. If that weren't bad enough, he has to look after a suicidal mother (Toni Collette) too wrapped up in her own problems to notice her son's. Watching Marcus make the transition from awkward social reject to well adjusted teenager shows some impeccably controlled acting on Hoult's part. I hope to hear big things from him in the future.Not everything about the film works. Will's relationship with Rachel Weisz never really convinces. It just suddenly comes out of nowhere, and there isn't that much chemistry between the two. Although in a (wise) departure from the book, Will tries to pass Marcus off as his son to get closer to Rachel, and once she learns of the deception, she is understandably hurt and betrayed. The book, more implausibly saw Rachel finding the sense in Will's little white lie. Perhaps Hornby saw his mistake and wanted to rectify it on film.But the way the film changes the book's ending is unforgivable. The novel had a more downbeat climax involving Marcus running away from home. But Universal pulling the strings have insisted on an upbeat, tacked-on happy ending. Involving a concert Marcus puts on to cure his mum's depression. Something purely contrived to help Toni Collette, heal the rift between Will, Rachel and Marcus all at the same time.Its all designed to bring the film to a neat resolution. Its times like this I wish British films nowadays didn't have the backing of American production companies. They end up losing too much in the transfer. Oh well, fun while it lasted. Still, there is plenty to enjoy. Not the least Will and Marcus's insightful opinions on life, some great acting from Grant and Hoult, and the superb soundtrack from Badly Drawn Boy. Worth the price of admission alone!",About a Boy
78,AvidClimber,About a Boy — What it means to be an island and what relationships are for,9,29 January 2013,"About a Boy is a charming movie about responsibilities or the lack thereof. It's a low key narrative where a boy has to deal with some realities of life he's not ready for, and where a man is confronted by reality and must connect with it.Hugh Grant, as usual, has its way with words, but his volume is pretty moderate this time around. Opposite him is Nicholas Hoult as the boy. Their character are very disparate if not entirely opposite, and they play this duality pretty well, one strengthening and helping the other finding some basic truths of life.All the acting is solid, to the point where you want to slap some sense into Toni Collette's depressive persona. The editing gives us a great pacing, and the story is engrossing and, even if it stays pretty simple, brings a couple of new things to the table, as well as some well worn out ideas. The ""lie"" makes an apparition, but is dealt with in an incredibly mature way. The environment is rich, the important characters deep, the soundtrack sensible, and you'll chuckle a good number of times.I highly recommend, except if you're looking for action or if you want to avoid sentimentality.",About a Boy

About a boy is an adaptation of the 1998 novel of the same name by Nick Hornby. Nick who is author of other film adaptations like Fever Pitch in 2005 and High Fidelity in 2000, allowed Hedges and the brother to work on the screenplay by themselves since the only film adaptation he worked on the screenplay is the 1997 British adaptation of Fever Pitch, which starred Colin Firth.About a boy is about Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) who lives a very carefree comfortable life in London, where Will doesn't work thanks to overly sufficient royalties left to him by his father from a successful Christmas song that his father composed. Due to this Will has enough time to meet women and has random sexual relationships with practically every woman he meets.Will soon discovered that single mothers are the easiest to get in bed, so he tried to nab as much as he can, his quest led him to meet Suzie and his dying need to get her in bed led him to meet Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who is a 12 year old son of Suzie's friend, Fiona (Toni Collette). A weird relationship developed between the two in a mentor and mentee kind of way, that made Will have more of a apart in Marcus life than he planned to.About a boy was a commercial success, making over 130 million dollars in the box office which is almost 7 times its production cost. The movie itself was a critical acclaim, with the AFI (American Film Institute) naming it one of the best as one of the ten best movies of the year 2002 and it holds a 93% approval rating on the critic aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.About a boy also got an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.

With some great acting from the best when it comes to this type of movie and also many great contributing factors, this is one big film which really is excellent. The script is tight, direction superb and even the setting is good too make this, in my opinion a just about great film and one that even has room to grow.The story is one that can touch the heart yet also find your funny bone and by the end you should feel well very pleasant. It is well timed all the way through and when the romantic areas are explored it holds it's ground making this better than the majority of Romcoms out there. I felt it could have been maybe slightly more laugh out loud but in any case it makes you giggle.Hugh Grant is excellent in the lead role and his relationship with Nicholas Holt is one to be savoured for the future generation of film lovers. Going on to Holt well his talent is plainly seen, not the best actor here but his work with Grant makes both of them shine so much that awards could have been won big time. People like Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz pitch in perfectly and they don't go understated when your done here.Many say this is one film which eclipses it's novel that it's based on and you can see why with such a strong script adapted beautifully and given so much rich depth that you finish the movie feeling you've seen the best of British cinema. I think Chris and Paul Weitz do a good job in directing and are part of the reason why Grant and Holt work so well, the two seem to be able to mould them to each other and get the best out of them.I think the main negativity comes from well very little, yes it lacks substantial comedy but then again, when are many films like this crying with laughter affairs. I felt Nicholas Holt can be poor(yes I know he's a child actor), I just felt he can seem to much like he is being directed and not portraying his true quality as an actor, but other than that very little is wrong with the film.If you like good old romps and a fun old adventure then this is for you as it really spans over a good year to show you truly everything about each main characters life. If your looking to be heart wrenched well I don't think it will make you cry but no doubt it has it's sadder moment but in any case, tissues should not be needed whilst viewing.Overall I think it was Just About an excellent comedy and one that will be remembered for a long time. The chemistry of the leads is truly the stand out point from this movie and without not just the characters but the two actors, this would have been greatly at a disadvantage. Love it or hate it and it be slightly soppy, this movie is sure to have some feeling warm and fuzzy but I accept some others will feel slightly more not annoyed but maybe cheesy seeing as the majority of this movie is very one liner orientated, but they all come out well.",About a Boy

Needless to say I was disappointed.I think where this movie started failing for me, for it does start off very well, is in the uniqueness of the boy and his mother. The two characters are presented as far out from an identifiable character as possible that they can't be reached by the audience. Sure, you can identify with a few aspects of their character, but they definitely stop being real.The character of Will is very close to being identifiable with, and so the audience can believe in him and feel emotion for him at the right times. Yet not for the boy or the mother, I mean when the boy declares to Will how recent events have upset him and really affected him, I felt sad and some empathy, but connection with my past or the character just didn't come. If only they'd injected a small part of reality into them then it would have.There's also a slight trouble with the clunkiness of some of the dialogue and choices that Will makes. His character is one that believes that ""a man can be an island...I'm bloody Ibiza!"", yet he makes some absurd against character choices and statements. For example when he says he really enjoys Christmas with the most bizarre bunch of people, yet he's clearly not. His character could have come to the same conclusions and the story taken the same journey, just with a bit more of a real view.Still, there are some excellent moments, the argument in the bar over Marcus coming to his house when his mother suggests he's been interfering with him is both awkward and funny, an excellently built scene.One good thing for Grant out of all this is that the movie does a good job of dispelling his previous movie parts, and he really does do a good job of what he's given.However, the poor moments did make me roll my eyes and took me straight out of the movie.

83,Mort-31,Under the line: disappointing,4,1 October 2003,"Turning Nick Hornby's sarcastically melancholic read-in-one-day bestseller into a movie with Hugh Grant as the main character Will should be a sure thing. The book's structure involves some obviously cinematic elements, so the filmmakers had the screenplay lying practically finished before them.Still, they managed to mess it up. Chris and Paul Weitz were a tiny bit too ambitious in making the film their own work. They left out character elements that are absolutely central in the book (like Marcus's childlike lack of sarcasm)  which, of course, is perfectly allowed in a film but still a pity. They cut out important scenes because they found them boring, which is why audiences who do not know the book are completely over-taxed by the mass of characters that are introduced and cleared out again within a few scenes (like Clive, Marcus's father, or Ellie, his first love).
Finally, they changed the last third, including, of course, the ending of the story. They did it, I suspect, only because they didn't want to play the film in the present and not in the middle of the 1990s, so they would have had to either distort history or leave out the entire Kurt Cobain story. So they were forced to invent a completely new ending. I do not think that the plots of books are sacrileges (on the contrary: I think they needn't be more than a matter of inspiration for the screenplays based upon them) but the ending they made up in this case, simply destroyed the whole story. It made it sentimental (not very sentimental but too sentimental), stale and abrupt. Whenever a filmmaker chooses to make major changes in a plot previously published, they must re-imagine the entire plot, otherwise the whole movie usually becomes a mess.The book About a Boy fascinated me partly because it was funny and sad at the same time.

Hugh Grant stars as Will, who differs from most of us in such a fundamental way that it makes him a very interesting guy. What makes Will out-of-sync with the world is that his late father once wrote a famous and with the royalties he collects from it, he doesn't have to work to sustain himself financially. The downside of this, of course, is that he doesn't have anything substantial or fulfilling in his life but he's very comfortable with that, at least at the beginning of the story.     What changes Will's life is the inadvertent introduction of a 12-year old boy and his suicidal mother (Toni Collette) into his life when a scheme to meet an attractive mom backfires. Like some of the best relationships in life, Will's with the 12-year old Marcus is involuntary at first but the two learn a lot from each other. With a of fear of losing his mother and an uneasiness about whom he can depend on, Will gives Marcus someone to look up to, while Marcus enables Will to find meaning in his life, especially when Will meets a woman he feels he might be able to fall in love with (Rachel Weicz).       This is the second Hugh Grant film that I've seen this year, which surprises me considering I still don't think Hugh Grant works most of the time. I credit this to an excellent adaptation of Hornsby's novel that adds more depth to Grant's role than the usual bumbling romantic lead, and also because within the setting of London Grant works better within the cultural context. The boy who plays Marcus is a cute kid who's easy to dislike at the beginning, but proves pretty bright when he takes Will's immensely useful tip that it is possible to change his level of coolness simply by changing some of the little things in his appearance (getting a haircut, buying new shoes, etc). Watching that scene warmly brings back memories of that monumental day in our own lives when it dawned upon is after years of feeling hopeless within our grade school social circles that it is, in fact, possible to change your level of coolness. The film is filled with a lot of those little things in life we can relate to so much more than we thought we would.",About a Boy

87,bix171,A Fine Hugh Grant Vehicle,9,5 March 2003,"Hugh Grant shines in this tailor-made vehicle that plays to his strengths. Grant is an actor who has to work hard with what he's got and his ability to clarify emotion with a minimum of facial expression or vocal inflection is impressive; he reveals a lot without giving too much away. (Tom Cruise, take note.) Here he stars (freed, finally, from the yoke of having to submerge himself alongside such aggressive egos as Julia Roberts and Renee Zellweger) as an independently wealthy bachelor forced to grow up when a desperate twelve-year-old boy (an endearing Nicholas Hoult) enters his life, enlisting him to help the boy's troubled mother (Toni Colette). It's clear that Grant without question is committed to his role and this infectious attitude carries over to the rest of the cast and the directors, brothers Chris and Paul Weitz, and what you have is a delicately balanced, elegantly crafted studio presentation that entertains even when it messes up--which the screenplay (by the Weitz brothers and Peter Hedges) and the pointed camerawork does quite frequently. (It equates independence with unhappiness and emphasizes conformity over idiosyncrasy.) Still, it's a successful hybrid of dark British wit and seriousness with care taken to provide a very satisfying conclusion.",About a Boy
88,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Great comedy!,6,17 June 2008,"A box-office smash in England, About a Boy went on to charm the world as another fine adaptation (following High Fidelity) of a popular Nick Hornby novel. While High Fidelity transplanted its London charm to Chicago, this irresistible comedy was directed by Americans Chris and Paul Weitz (American Pie) with its British pedigree intact. Better yet, Hugh Grant is perfectly cast as Will, a self-absorbed trust-fund slacker who tries to improve his romantic odds by preying on desperate single mothers. His cynical strategy backfires when he recruits the misfit son (Nicholas Hoult) of a suicidal mother (Toni Collette) to pose as his own son, thus proving his parental prowess to his latest single-mom target (Rachel Weisz). The kid has a warming effect on this ultimate cad, and what could have been a sappy tearjerker turns into a subtle, frequently hilarious portrait of familial quirks and elevated self-esteem. From start to finish, it's a genuine treat.Starring: Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Sharon Small, Toni Collette. Director: Chris & Paul Weitz.",About a Boy

90,refresh_daemon,a nice straightforward story,7,5 November 2006,"On my roommate's recommendation, I got a hold of this film and watched it on a night where I hadn't a whole lot to do otherwise. And... it wasn't bad.When I saw Hugh Grant on the cover, I was a bit skeptical that I would be wandering into another romantic comedy. But then I saw that it was based on a novel by Nick Hornby, who wrote the novel High Fidelity, upon which the movie by the same name is based and I liked High Fidelity plenty, especially considering that it's a romantic comedy. So I let down my guard.And I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't just another run-of-the-mill story, but rather, it was about... a boy. And a man. Or is the man a boy? No science fiction here, it's just a story about a older man learning what it means to be a human being through an expected mentor/friend relationship with a kid 1/3 his age. The characters are interesting and developed, even if the story is as clear as plastic wrap and the plotting obvious. But I like the story anyway, even if during the film, I still had doubts now and again.I did have one little qualm with the film, and that is that it's directed like every mainstream British comedy that I've seen, complete with the sad-montage sequence with some pop tune coursing through the film. But at least the characters were so well done, it didn't bother me too much that the film didn't really have much of a personality, at least artistically.So, it's essentially, a nice very straightforward story, with well developed characters and a very predictable (almost boring) style.

94,JBoze313,"Very good, but o course...the book was mucy better",9,23 September 2002,"**possible spoilers**
About A Boy is a great book, and a good movie. As is the case with most movies that started out as books, the book was much better, but in the end, the movie is a decent carbon copy. It basically is that, besides the fact that they left out a lot of the story with Marcus' father and Marcus' budding relationship with Ellie. It seemed as tho they thought they had to Ellie in the movie somewhere so threw her in real quick and dropped it. That was disappointing, because I think Marcus' relationship with Ellie and the visit to his father's house was a big reason why he finally figured out that he would be okay. Aside from that, the movie had all the book had, and it was executed very well. I like Grant as Will, he did a really good job, and the kid who plays Marcus, I must admit I have no idea what his name is (Nick maybe?) was also very good. He has the role of Marcus down perfectly in my opinion, and he had a really good chemistry with Grant. Hugh Grant, despite the public embarassment he suffered some years ago is a really likeable guy, and a very likeable character for the most part, no matter what the role may be. He's cool and slick as Will, and it works. Collette is perfect for the role of Marcus' mother. I honestly couldn't stand her in the movie, which was the point. She was annoying, too old fashioned, and very nerdy...perfect. About A Boy is cute, it's funny, it's witty...In the end...it's entertaining. This is one of those movies I could watch more than once and still get a kick out of it. Really good movie...I highly recommend it. 8/10",About a Boy
95,Gubby-Allen,Excellent Hugh Again,7,1 May 2002,"A good film, where Hugh Grant does well with a script not quite up to previous he's starred in. I've never read the book & doubt I ever will, but nevertheless enjoyed the film.It amazes me people make so much of Grant playing a 'reasonably' similar character in most of his roles. John Wayne made an entire living out of that. So did James Stewart as the unfortunate but likeable bloke & Cary Grant as loveable rogue and for the same reason, because they were great at it. In any case, in About a Boy, his role was fairly different to any of his others, probably closest to the Bridget Jones role.The film was itself was highly enjoyable, but I didn't find it overly funny. Granted there were quite a few funny scenes, but little that had you in hysterics. Occasionally the plot seemed to lose a little direction but the most irritating thing had to be Marcus's hair. Lets hope we're not going down the American road with that childs style. There was an ideal opportunity about half way through for him to have it cut too.I felt slightly disappointed coming out, but only due to the high standard of these sorts of films that preceeded it. Four Weddings, Notting Hill were brilliant & Mickey Blue Eyes & Bridget Jones very good, and Bend it Like Beckham running simultaneously next door slightly better.But this was good, recommendable & had lots to offer for all viewers, male, female, young, old etc, but just didn't quite hit the heights it could have.7/10",About a Boy

Hugh Grant's unabashed self-assessment of his shallowness and why he did what he did is refreshing and fits him so perfectly as an actor, it should be a requisite. Young Mr. Hough's performance for a juvenile actor is stunningly perfect and drives the character. Toni Colette's vegan grown-up-hippie and chronically depressed mother is brilliantly conceived and executed by one of the best actresses of our era. Around this perfectly conceived and believable exposition are terrific supporting performances including Rachael Weisz and a terrific eye for detail from the director.

Fortunately, he is almost as charming in this movie as any other time. I think he would make a good Bond - post Brosnan. And, the last 20 minutes or so were redeemable. But, that's about it.I can't comprehend how so many people gave this movie such high marks. The first hour plus was torturously slow and boring. I disliked most of the characters - and utterly loathed the kid's mom. In fact, the kid, himself, was barely tolerable until near the end and even then was (AT BEST) average. Worse, he was the co-star of the movie.Furthermore, I HATE rap! I HATE anything that has to do with it! I HATE the culture that spawns it! That isn't to say this was a rap movie. It wasn't. But, it had enough in it that I nearly puked. And, the whole idea of an almost all white school becoming almost all rap-oriented was ludicrous.I don't like English movies all that well either. I can't understand what they are saying some of the time and it is, frankly, too much work to try to listen. I want to be spoon-fed when it comes to movies.

101,Benjamin_Cox,A surprise but hardly a laugh riot - 70%,7,21 November 2007,"If the approaching Christmas season is prompting more calls from your Better Half for yet another by-the-numbers rom-com with Hugh Grant then maybe you might try and throw a spanner into the works with this. Yes, Grant plays another thoroughly English cad looking for love in the wrong places but this is something very different. For a start, it's much less frothy than his other films and a lot darker in tone. This is as far removed from nonsense like ""Two Weeks Notice"" or ""Bridget Jones"" as you can think of and you know something - it's all the better for it.Grant plays Will, a professional bachelor who sponges a living off the royalties of a Christmas one-hit wonder. He likes fast cars, the latest CDs and spending his days killing time. After enjoying a brief fling with a single parent, he decides to focus his efforts on this particular group of women in hope of meaningless sex maybe turning into something else. However, he hits on the wrong woman who turns up to their date with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). Striking an unlikely friendship with the bullied and seriously uncool Marcus, they both discover that they can learn much about life from the other - much to Will's surprise.Based on the Nick Hornby novel of the same name, ""About A Boy"" can best be described as viciously gentle. Tackling difficult issues with humour and pathos is never easy and certainly not when the movie is helmed by the people behind ""American Pie"". But this is one film that really breaks the mould and constantly surprises, Grant playing Will with almost shocking venom for one. Hoult is also very good as poor Marcus, though I did feel that Rachel Weisz was little more than underused eye candy. Toni Collette also does well as Marcus's bohemian mother but I felt the role was under-developed in relation to the role in the book. Something else that also changed was the ending, which veered away from the whole 'Kurt Cobain' theme of the novel and dangerously towards something like an American high school comedy. But at its heart, ""About A Boy"" is an affecting drama as well as a effective comedy. But rarely is it hilarious and this does hinder the film's appeal somewhat.So it's a pleasant surprise lifted by class performances in the leads but like the novel, I never really felt like it deserved the amount of praise heaped upon it. The novel left me feeling cold and unengaged and the movie does too, to some extent. The characters are too remote, almost implausible, for the audience to empathise with but in spite of this, ""About A Boy"" is a hard film to dislike. Like I said, it's a very gentle film - one that surprises and even challenges you but it just never raises its game enough. A good film, then and one that certainly goes down better than ""Bridget Jones: The Edge Of Reason"" at any rate...",About a Boy

Surprisingly he doesn't have a job or never had one for too long, but doing quite well off with a steady income thanks to his father. As he calls himself he is an 'Island'. Living alone in an apartment with his own little positive attitude towards it, Will fails to have a steady relationship what so ever. Until this 12 year old boy he meets up while trying to get attention from single mothers. Soon he finds interest in this boy and amidst all the issue the boy has at home they become close to each other. And then Will realizes that life has much more than just living alone with random dates to accompany him and his big CD collection.Coming from a Nick Hornby's best-selling novel, the script of this flick is totally entertaining. Moving back and forth from the thoughts inside Will's head and to things what actually happens around him gives an exposure of what Will's life and expectations are all about. Though he is a 'self centered ignorant bastard' he does have some thoughts of being more communicative or trying to help the people around him. But that though soon disappear and he finds himself in the same old selfish place.Hugh Grant does a good job on his role of portraying Will. Will is charming, smooth and uses his words carefully. And when it's the time to slip away he just does that without hesitating.From an adults point of view sometimes the kid will annoy you. But then he is just a kid and life is not the same for kids as adults. Especially when he got a suicidal mom! And while this kid is craving for attention, Will the totally opposite tries to hide away in his own agenda.

After all these years, I end up seeing the film two days. This was definitely not the wait and I don't believe on how long I actually had to wait to see this film. This is one of the most marvelous comedy dramas I have ever seen in such a long time.The story follows a lonesome young man who doesn't have a job, stays home and watches TV all day and basically chills out. It's not until he joins a ""single parents group"" and then meets little Marcus that his life slowly starts to change into something that he has never experienced before. This boy teaches him how to be a ""mature being"".I really enjoyed everything about this intriguing film. By the ending title credits, I was totally hooked and my eyes never took away from the screen. The actors were beautifully produced and developed, the story is an excellent scent to get into and there are many comedic scenes which will have you laughing.Hugh Grant is obviously the main star of this film and for good reason. He does an excellent job of adapting this role of Will, the selfish but isolated man who just wants to be left alone, and wants to live his life alone. I really had sympathy for the character because I knew what he was going through. I'm sure everyone in real life has experienced some of the traumas that the Will Character goes through. You really love him even if he can get picky in many areas. I could really relate to him myself in some ways. Hugh Grant of course brings this character to life. It's not only with the character's mood and the atmosphere of him but it's the comic relief and comedic dialogue which makes him come to life fully.The boy who plays as the young, lost little soul Marcus, was also quite a powerful figure throughout this film. We too also feel sorry for him as he has a hard time living at home, getting bullied and only having Will to look up to. Even though he is harmless in every way possible, it doesn't stop him from wanting to help Will in the best way possible to succeed and not be held back by isolation. The boy too doesn't have any friends and is treated badly but Will seems to be a build up of an excellence for him. The two have each other to bounce off of. But it is the boy which works on Will more with emotions and life itself because the boy helps Will to change his view on life. Will alter realizes that Marcus is the only person he has really gottan to love. This creates a semi-father son hood. It also has many funny results as some things don't go the way Will plans it.The back up actors and sound track score are also an excellent back up throughout. The story is also well scripted.The film receives: 9/10",About a Boy

Rachel Weisz is also very good, but her role in this movie was relatively small, and her character is unremarkable (slightly unlikeable, actually).The actress, who plays the boy's Mother, was very good at portraying a suicidal hippie -- she looked the part. I was glad to see they didn't bring in a famous actress for that role; it would've probably spoilt it.I would've liked it if Hugh Grant and the boy's Mother got together in the end, and if she got a makeover or something -- it would've been more interesting, but... oh, well.The child actors did a good job.

It is after all a family-movie with all its ingredients: neurotic mothers, indifferent or clumsy fathers, noisy children but in this one there are no disturbing dogs or cats.  The writer of the novel Nick Hornby knows what is going on nowadays in the cities: loneliness, no sense of life, boredom, children who disappoint... So this movie is a sociological study of modern life in the cities.  The peculiarity of this movie is that women seem to be attracted by fathers who have children, for men it is the opposite: they avoid divorced women with children.

I tried searching for good movies to watch and About a Boy was recommended more than two times. I decided to give it a try, but I wasn't really expecting anything. So basically, I started watching this movie with no expectations whatsoever. And I must say, WOW. I was blown away.This could easily be one of the best comedy flicks there are out there. The laughs I had during this movie were very numerous. The funniest scene for me was probably the first half of the Fiona-Will confrontation scene. But aside from the humor, the underlying family tones are also great.Will was sort of what you'd call a mild playboy. He wasn't as wild as Barney Stinson (HIMYM), but he does make up crazy stories to get accepted by girls that he likes. The scene where he tries picking up women in a Single Parents Alone Together club was funny. However in the end, he wizened up. He realized that there was more to life. He realized this with the help of a boy named Marcus.Marcus was a kid who kept on getting teased and bullied by his schoolmates. Aside from that, his mom, Fiona, was also problematic. Marcus seeks refuge from his world by spending time with Will who shows Marcus how to have fun. He is also a very brave kid. In one of the last scenes, where he sings in front of the whole school, that must have taken real guts. I was very impressed. But then again, it is a movie. I bet if that was real life and people were booing you off the stage, he'd burst into tears and beg his mom to let him transfer schools.Hearing Hugh Grant sing ""Killing Me Softly"" reminded me of his role in Music and Lyrics with Drew Barrymore when they sang ""Way Back into Love"". Is it just me or does all movies where Grant features have a song solo? I think the main reason why I rated this movie so high was because I really liked seeing Marcus and Will's relationship develop. This movie isn't like your average movie where the boy falls in love with the girl and they live happily ever after and blah blah blah. Well, sure, Will falls in love with another woman, but the movie's focus wasn't on them. Majority of the movie focused on the boys' friendship and how other events affected them. That was a welcome change from all the same-plot romance movies we have now.I was expecting an average movie on a lazy, boring night, but what I got was so much more. Another favorite classic movie and high standards for other movies of the same genre. I think I'm going to read Nick Hornby's book now.

Two different lives, two different sets of problems but ultimately one thing in common: depression, loneliness and unhappiness. Hugh Grant plays Will, a thirty-something bachelor who lives off family royalties and lives his life responsibility free.. Always on the lookout for women he makes up that he has a son and joins a single parents group. Here he meets a woman and on their first date to the park she brings along her friends son Marcus (played by Nicholas Hoult). Marcus is a socially awkward, bullied teenager who sees Will as a perfect match for his depressed Mother. The relationship that Will and Marcus develop is something special and takes them on a real coming of age journey together.Nicholas Hoult was only 12 when filming About a Boy and it was his first major role so the pressure was on for him to give a convincing performance when he was the co-lead actor in the movie. He had the support of Hugh Grant so it wasn't on his shoulders to carry the movie on his own but he had a significant amount of screen time and was as an important character as Hugh Grant. His performance was incredibly good, he played the anti-social, shy and nerdy kid extremely well, he didn't just get by, he excelled and really made the character his own. If you've seen Hugh Grant movies before then you will know what to expect from his performance. He complimented Hoult very well, having what seems at first as polar opposite personalities but as the film progresses we see that their differences aren't all that significant. The supporting cast all give solid performances also, adding the depth required convincingly.The story on paper seems a little far-fetched as it doesn't appear to be a story that would likely be presented in real life or even widely accepted in modern society. The message behind the story is one of desperation, loneliness, depression and companionship. It's touching and emotional at times but then hilariously heart-warming at others. It's a very charming movie that will leave you feeling very satisfied as the credits roll.9/10",About a Boy
114,DanB-4,A Better Jerry Maguire,8,28 July 2002,"For me this movie had a very strong parallel to Jerry Maguire. In both movies, you have handsome, self-involved male leads leading perfect lives. They both have an epiphany that is based on their relationship with a woman and a young boy and the film concentrates on the transformation of the lead character.I liked About a Boy much better for a couple of reasons. First, Will (Hugh Grant)'s epiphany is much more subtle and happens throughout the film, and happens as a result of him indulging his own character flaws (ie this all starts due to his grand idea of picking up single mothers at a support group meeting). Second, the relationship with the boy is not a slam dunk. Who wouldn't love the kid in Jerry Maguire? The boy here is annoying, self-righteous, talkative and understandably friendless. Dumping him and getting on with his life would have been much more in character for Will - we feel almost like a proud parent as we watch him grow more and more attached to him.This movie is Hugh Grant's finest hour. He gets to play his handsome, bumbling polite Englishman, but this time, it is wrapped in a selfish playboy with lots of money and no apparant job. A dream life, or so it would seem. Grant effortlessly draws us into this character and allows us to feel the emptiness of his life, but also his frustration and lack of will to change it. As he says, "" I was the star of the Will show and it was not an ensemble drama.""About a boy is not a chick flick. It is a good-hearted comedy about a man who makes decisions against every selfish instinct that has dictated his life. It is a breath of fresh air in the world of car chases and special effects. I enjoyed this film immensely. ***1/2 out of ****.",About a Boy
115,mweston,3 stars,7,10 July 2002,"Hugh Grant plays Will, who is independently wealthy because his father wrote one hit song many years ago. His house looks like a Sharper Image catalog and he drives an Audi TT, but his friends, who are all married with children, keep asking him if he wants anything more out of life. One couple asks him to be their child's godfather, and Will suggests that that would be a really bad idea.Will gets set up with a woman who turns out to be a single mother, which surprisingly turns out pretty well for him when she breaks up with him just as he starts to tire of her (he's never had a relationship last longer then two months). So he invents an imaginary son and attends a group meeting for single parents. As a result, he eventually meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), who is a 12 year old boy. His mother (Toni Collette) is a vegetarian hippy who dresses Marcus funny, but he loves her anyway. He ends up taking a liking to Will, and the bulk of the film revolves around them. A great deal of the narrative is carried in the form of voice overs by the characters, which works but may take you a little out of the film after a while.The acting is good. This is perhaps the most interesting role I can recall Hugh Grant playing, since he begins the film as a proudly shallow man and evolves, in fits and starts, over the course of the film. Nicholas Hoult does a convincing job of portraying a child who doesn't really fit in anywhere. Toni Collette, as my wife pointed out, is under utilized, but is still good. All in all, the film presents an interesting set of characters that I was glad to have had a chance to meet.One interesting technique which I don't recall being used before was what I would call a pan cut. The film pans from one scene to another, so that in the middle of the pan the left half of the frame is a different scene than the right half. I guess it's just a wipe, except with the camera movement of a pan. I imagine that it was probably done digitally.The film is based on a novel by Nick Hornby, who also wrote ""High Fidelity."" In the early parts of this film, I was really enjoying myself and felt that it was in the same league, but in the end it didn't feel as complete somehow. But since that's a pretty high standard, I would definitely still recommend this film.",About a Boy
116,K-Slicer,It is Tenworthy,10,16 February 2003,"""About A Boy"" is a comedy that reminds me a lot of a Wes Anderson film but it was directed by the boys from ""American Pie"". It turns that really good comedic director can make both smart funny and stupid funny films are worth viewing. There are ten reasons ""About A Boy"" is worth a trip to the video store.1) Paul and Chris Weitz did a superior job of directing the movie. They are very versatile when it comes to the material they choose. 2) Hugh Grant had the best comedic performance of the year. It was also the best of his career. 3) Nicholas Hoult was extraordinary as the rather observant and somewhat smart-alecky Marcus. 4) The writing was is definitely Oscar-worthy. The proof is in the nomination it received. 5) The music is really good. Badly Drawn Boy was an interesting choice and the songs that were crafted were of superior quality. 6) The duck scene is a classic. 7) Toni Collette plays a great mother. This is her best role since ""The Sixth Sense"". 8) The story took an interesting twist on the child teaching adult formula and formed it into something palatable. 9) The cinematography is riveting and almost unreal. 10) The conclusion was nice to view and not sappy.I think film is the best of the last year that I have actually seen.  Hugh Grant is one of my favorite actors and I hope he continues to find roles that go against that romantic lead typecast he seems to be labeled with. ""About A Boy"" gets 10 out of 10!

Marcus did the song "" killing me softly "" because it was one of his mums favorites and even though the audience was banal and cruel he still had the gumption and heart to get up there an perform for his mom. life isn't about trying to fit in and be with the cool crowd, there's so much more important things in life then that and Marcus was mature enough to understand that, with help from Will of course. well, i won't give anything else away about this movie, but if you're looking for a intelligent, heartwarming, tender, sad and funny movie, this is it. i would recommend this movie to just about anybody over the age of 10. this is one of those hidden little gems that has also a very strong positive message about what is right and what is wrong. there was not one dull moment in this movie and i think i must've chuckle or guffawed about 50 times during the duration of this movie and it's not a long movie.if you like intelligent tender heartwarming comedic movies where all the actors and actresses were in top form...then you have to watch this movie. one of my favorite comedies all-time.",About a Boy

It's very rare now for a movie to be this funny and at the same time be just as touching, too. You actually care for the characters in this movie and the ending is satisfying. Hugh Grant is great as Will and it is definitely his best performance. Also, About A Boy just wouldn't be the same without the soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy. It's disappointing that not a lot of people went to see it in theatres since it was in almost direct competition with spider-man and star wars, but now that it's on video do not pass up the chance to see it.

121,shneur,Uncomfortable relationships.,8,21 March 2005,"What I liked about this film was that it didn't ""guild the lily"" with any of its characters. In particular, Marcus's mother, who is clinically depressed, is presented correctly as emotionally numb and pretty much oblivious to those around her. This is quite different from the usual (erroneous) Hollywood version of effusive, and usually loquacious, sadness. Even the boy, who is the real hero of the story, is allowed to be not-all-that-likable. Beyond the movie itself, I really enjoyed the interview with High Grant that was included on the DVD. He was honest enough to admit that he genuinely does not much care for children, and so the discomfort and emotional distance between Will and Marcus is not fake. I think he mentioned insisting that they not cast a kid who was going to want to hug him or something similar, and that comes across clearly in the film, adding to rather than detracting from the texture of the story.",About a Boy
122,Andreas_N,Mix of comedy and drama,8,19 December 2005,"There were several aspects that made me appreciate this movie despite my personal reluctance to commend comedies of similar arrangements.First of all I found the inner monologues of the two main characters an inventive and unusual feature. This added to the comedy aspect and caused hilarious scenes. In addition it added depth to the characters themselves, which is something comedies of this sort normally lack. To put this into the right perspective, some of the thoughts we are presented with are rather artificial, but still, the approach itself and its effect on the storyline is something that needs to be appreciated.The plot is modest, but has some unexpected strengths. I was frankly surprised about the mix of realistic challenges of life and the comedy aspects, as I thought the latter would be the movie's emphases. However, they were in balance - the movie dealt with real problems many members of the audience are probably able to relate to. The comedy was sometimes too artificial, but it seems to have worked in this case.Hugh Grant and his attitude towards life is one major theme, Nicholas Hoult's portrayal of Marcus the second prevailing one. The movie then focuses on these two characters and makes them influence each other - which leads to interesting changes and challenges for the protagonists, and that is what puts this movie above the ordinary.I generally do not like Hugh Grant's humor. Here again he seems a bit uncomfortable as Nicholas' partner. He kind of aces his comedy parts with his very own sense of entertaining the audience, but as soon as it comes to difficult scenes demanding more than superficial acting, he seems - yeah, a bit uneasy.Nonetheless, considering the general lack of sophistication comedies such as these aim at, this movie is an improvement. The father-son relationship which is subtly addressed lacks real emotional depth - again something which accrues from the movie's arrangement as a comedy - but is decent to watch and carries some messages.I personally like Hugh Grant's philosophy of life - something many male singles will be able to relate to somehow - and the way he justifies his attitude. The changes which happen after he has encountered Marcus make this movie worthwhile, as they entail a character development and some messages of life.'No man is an island' - Marcus' last words and his face as the closing scene made me appreciate this movie as a whole, because it really made its way off the corny trash and has managed to mix comedy with sincere issues of life - something hard to find.",About a Boy
123,wolfhell88,Stay away from this film and better read the book!,1,12 February 2014,"I really loved the book ""About a Boy"" from Nick Hornby. Its a wonderful story about a selfish man who makes friendship with a young boy because he dates his mother. The young boy reminds him much of himself, so he helps him to make the best out of his life and at the end the selfish man becomes a caring person.There also was a subplot in the book about a Nirvana fan named Ellie who became the boys best friend. The book was funny, smart and heartwarming and I couldn't wait to see the film. What a disappointment!They turned this great book into a really bad and boring movie! Only 20 percent from the story of the book is used in this film. It's really strange because Nick Hornby himself wrote the script.You cannot blame it on the actors: Hugh Grant gives a fine performance, even when you read the book Grant comes in your mind. But the film has no drive, no humor, nothing. Just boring.Stay away from this boring film and better read the book.",About a Boy

125,crowrobot,Effortlessly charming,10,27 May 2005,"'About a Boy' is, quite simply, charming. It's got a lot of heart, it's very funny, and Hugh Grant has now made himself known to me. Before I saw this movie, I wanted nothing to do with Grant; I am not a fan of romantic comedies, and that is what Grant has made a career out of. Nevertheless, Grant really is charming and witty, and he's got that perfect swagger that lets you know exactly where he stands.In 'About A Boy', Grant plays Will, a thirty-something bachelor who has made a life out of doing absolutely nothing productive. His father wrote a hit Christmas song, and he's been living off the royalties. Will has never had a meaningful relationship that lasted more than one month, and his life (in his opinion) ROCKS. One of the things that I liked about the movie was Grant's utter believability: He knows his life is meaningless, and he doesn't care. That is, until Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) comes into his life. Will has adopted a new target group for dating: Single moms. Through a single parents support group (he lies to get in), he meets Fiona (Toni Collette) and Marcus. Marcus is rather lonely, and after a series of circumstances, he ends up at Will's house watching TV. Slowly, but surely, Will and Marcus begin to connect.Grant is, as I said before, utterly charming and believable, and Nicholas Hoult is the best young actor working these days besides Haley Joel Osment (there is an amusing reference to him in the movie). Collette is wonderful, and the lovely Rachel Weisz turns up as a potential love interest for Will.Directors Paul and Chris Weitz ('American Pie') manage to not let the movie bog down in too much sentimentality, and the finale is pitch-perfect (as well as hilarious). The movie is based on a book by author Nick Hornby ('High Fidelity', 'Fever Pitch'). I shall have to read something by Hornby, if this great movie's any indicator of his skills. 10/10",About a Boy
126,irish23,Better than average; still predictable,7,12 August 2008,"Toni Collette is the best part of the picture, portraying a completely 4-dimensional role as someone with chronic, severe depression. Unfortunately, the word ""depression"" or ""illness"" is never used in the picture, so people watching it may not understand what her problem is.Hugh Grant plays yet another version of Hugh Grant (always dependable) and does a great job at one point of removing all signs of intelligence from his face and eyes -- truly going ""blank.""This rom-com-drama is one of a long series from England (often starring Hugh Grant) beginning with Four Weddings & A Funeral, where personal relationships are placed in the greater context of family and friends. The core story is predictable, so you're left with the quirks to determine whether this will be memorable or not. About A Boy is memorable due to its handling of some of the more ""deep"" themes -- it doesn't get too maudlin and doesn't gloss over them too much, either. It allows the viewer to take it further if they want, but keeps it to a consistent degree of intensity for those who just want to see Grant be Grant.There are few surprises (though the ones that pop up can be shockers) and ultimately it's a predictable picture, but it's definitely a cut above average.",About a Boy
127,Daniel Karlsson,Great!,8,25 June 2002,"I was quite sceptical to this, being a Hugh Grant film and all, but it was a delightful surprise. This movie is fresh and clean, and every scene feels air-conditioned. The script is excellent, every line fits well, and it's good to see that the one(s) behind it know how love begins, in contrary to the producers in Hollywood. The camera work is good. Some passages I have been looking for so much in other movies are being performed with ease here. The music fits very well. Rachel Weisz is acting good and well, unbelievable beautiful, one of the top five most beautiful women on screen ever if you ask me, without doubt.So, no let-downs at all? I think the film should have been better off being more emotional. When you leave the cinema you don't remember it that passionately, it's rather flat. I am not sure Hugh Grant is that good at being emotional. And a few longer still scenes would perhaps have given the film more depth. But, it's also a comedy, and occasionally it's actually really funny.4 / 5",About a Boy
128,crypticcrytic,The price of their toys,9,25 May 2002,"Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) is the quintessential bachelor: good looks, health, independent means and completely unattached. Add an element of privilege, remove any trace of ambition and include a generous helping of self-reliance and you've got a character you love to hate. This man-child has just about all that's distasteful in the modern bachelor and the Peter Pan Syndrome has never been so well represented. Get the picture?Yet there's a hint of growth here.  Will has a new strategy to pursue more vulnerable women:  pretend you're a single dad and join a support group since that's where the single moms hang. However, a few steps into this pond and Mr. Shallow is out of his depth. Most of these joiners don't fit the demographics Will seeks. But it's through SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together) that he connects with the Boy Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).A wonderful screenplay keeps this film moving through the perilous quest that would undermine a lesser talent. Letting us into the thoughts of our hero (using voice-over) adds an unspoken monologue that tops his incredibly self-centered attitude. And he gets away with it. Marcus has his thoughts treated this way as well and here we see adolescent struggles with socialization, acceptance and responsibilities. Though 25 years separate the man and the boy, their struggles are the same. We sympathize with Marcus since these lessons are age appropriate for him. Will should have gotten past it long ago. Arrested development isn't an acceptable defense.Toni Collette sensitively plays the boy's suicidal mom.  Rachel Wiesz handles the role of the ultimate challenge (taming Will).'About a Boy' then is really about two boys, both seeking an identity that extends beyond their own needs and interests. How they do it is the substance of this film that deserves your time. Will realizes that relationships involving more than two members may have exponentially greater potential. Perhaps not in all cases, but this realization helps propel Will from boyhood. When you see this film, you'll be all ""About a Boy.""",About a Boy

I'm not sure he'll go places like Haley Joel Ozment -- whom he compares himself to early on -- but by the end of the film, once his hair style gains attitude, he's a good enough looking kid, and a good actor.Hugh Grant does a terrific job being a not-nice-but-not-bastardly-guy -- will he be nominated for an Oscar?  Well, just a few more weeks will tell, but he really did well in this.Rachel Weisz (sp?) puts on a posh London accent as flawlessly as did Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones's Diary (which also featured Hugh Grant in a bastardly role -- hmmm, makes one think ...), although it's a bit hard to believe her as the mother of a 12-year-old -- but that's me, father of a pair of five year olds at age 43!

131,Juni78ukr,About an excellent movie.,10,4 December 2004,"I love British films but it was incredibly hard to believe that Weitz brothers, who have made miserable American Pies films, could have made any worthy film. I was so wrong! About a Boy is an excellent film, definitely in my top five of 2002 and even more, it is in my all-time top ten. First of all it's really hard to decide what genre exactly is this film. At first sight it look more like romance comedy but after you have watched it more carefully and more than once it become obviously that About a Boy is an intelligent inspiring drama. This film is a very rare case when some comedy elements incredibly well harmonize with more important and complicated elements of drama. There are many reasons for considering this film as a masterpiece. First of all it's the script. At first it's in many parts different from the Nick Hornby's book, so some people who love the book can be disappointed, though screenwriters despite all changes were able to catch the book's atmosphere. So the story is a bit simpler and at the same time more positive than in the book. It contains lots of wit, heart and believability. This is a story about two leading characters Will and Marcus. Will (Hugh Grant character) is a 38 years old single man. His father years ago wrote a famous Christmas song and after his death Will has received the author's rights for the song and continually gets the money from them. He has never been working more than month or two in a row and his lifestyle is very simple. First: every man is an island. And the second: I don't care about others and no one cares about me. He spends all of his time watching TV, shopping CD and other things, stylizing his hair and dating with his girlfriends. After one of his dates he invents a new idea about dating single mothers and taking off before their relations become too serious. That seems perfect to him but when he meets 12 years old Marcus his life begin to change. I think Hugh Grant was an ideal choice for Will (in my opinion it's his best performance so far). He is always very good as a comedy actor and in About a Boy he proves his acting ability not only as a shallow comedy star. Will character could have been at least unpleasant and it is only bright charming Hugh Grant performance give us the impression that Will not as bad as he looks. There are also many minor, almost unnoticeable details which confirm such impression. Marcus is a 12 years old, smart and sensitive but gawky boy, who lives with his depressed mother Fiona (Toni Collette), perfectly played by a new rising star Nicholas Hoult. Nicholas Hoult is brilliant as Marcus. His acting is so powerful and emotional that it's impossible to look at his character without strong sympathy. Marcus easily became outcast in the school and in the whole society. He seeks a kind of refuge in Will house and while they spend time together Will learns new things about himself and take some life lessons. Will's evolution and awakening from a selfish idler to a really warm and likable character is perfectly shown through this film. These two main characters are so real that it's easy for many people to find some similarities with them. The good point is that the story never becomes predictable even for people who have read the book. Though the dialogs in the movie are quite different from the book, they are well written, funny and memorable. The music written by Badly Drawn Boy (absolutely new name for me) is quite suitable and original. It supplies some additional charms to the story. And about the comedy parts. I must say that I can't remember another film when such strong and touching drama makes you smile and laugh so many times. This film is very heartfelt and it carries lots of inspiring and smart messages. In the conclusion About a Boy is an excellent, entertained and enjoyable film, which deserves to be taken more serious than most of people did. Could this movie have been better? In conditions of such changed script that seems unlikely to me. So it's not quite a perfect adaptation of one of my favorite books but nevertheless as a movie it's almost perfect masterpiece.10 out of 10 or solid A (one of the best of the year).

Sad-sack loner Will is forced out of his self-imposed isolation by overzealous social outcast Marcus. The pair unintentionally, and unwillingly on the part of Will, reform each other's negative habits and become a family. Will is the epitome of self-centered and selfish, making all his decision to reinforce his preferred lifestyle and in the hope of hooking up with women. His constant voice over of internal monologue provides a clear insight as to precisely what the movie is trying to communicate, leaving no room for viewer error or a touching moment. The British charm that is clearly meant to carry one through the award moments and make dysfunction seem quaint falls rather flat and the lack of soundtrack in uncomfortable moments simply clashes with the up-front narrative style. It certainly fits with the style of the time, and the change in character for Will is emotionally fulfilling if a bit cliche.",About a Boy

Marcus wanted Will to possibly marry his mother to save her from depression and loneliness. Neither of their plans end up working out, but the two end up being an enormous influence in the life of the other. I think the part of the movie that I found the most moving was the very real depression that comes over people and the darkness of the reality that surrounds us. To me it shows that we really have to choose happiness in as many ways as we can. I fill that the film fits well into its category. It spans across the drama-comedy-romance quite nicely. The one thing I felt that this film could improve upon is its blocking. Sometimes the actors movements felt uncomfortable, but it was easily masked with the dialogue.

The story is about a womanizer, who has never worked a day in his life, Will Freeman played by Hugh Grant, that meets a down on his luck boy, Marcus played by Nicholas Hoult, and discovers a surprising connection that could change the course of their lives. This film is awkwardly hilarious and towards the end of the film, Marcus delivers a line to Will that should make every human take a step back and evaluate their own life.This movie seamlessly intertwines two stories in this film. The main being from Will's point of view and the second is about Marcus and his mother, Fiona played by Toni Collette, as they deal with his mother's depression and being bullied at school. Though the film doesn't have anything I can specifically relate to, it does have moments of emotional impact that will stay with me. The strength that Marcus displays as he makes conscious efforts to force Will to become a part of his family was odd, but powerful.

138,tvspace,a puddle of sap,3,3 June 2002,"About a Boy is a maudlin puddle of sap that, while billed as a romantic comedy, is neither romantic nor funny.Every character in the movie is a pale cliche:  the crazy hippie, the self-absorbed yuppie, the angry single mother, the dreamy artist, the tattooed motorcycle-jacket lesbian, the nerdy kid who doesn't fit in, the playground bullies, the nose-pierced punk rocker with a heart of gold...one after another these tired stereotypes traipse across the screen, leaving a sugary slime on the ground like a slug slithering over the pavement.There's only one real laugh in the film, and that's when Hugh Grant turns a volunteer stint working the phones at Amnesty International into an opportunity for phone sex.  The rest of the movie is too pious to be funny and too concocted to be emotionally interesting.It's extremely disheartening to read the litany of moonstruck reviews served up by those who call About a Boy an insightful examination of the contemporary male persona.  Hugh Grant's shallow character doesn't have anything to do with the contemporary male persona, or any other male persona for that matter, and thank God for that.This film is so shamelessly sentimental and badly written that I was literally hiding my face under my sweater in several places out of sheer pain and embarrassment.  At other times I was praying to God for the movie to end (checking my watch sadly revealed I was only 45 minutes into the fiasco), and on a later occasion I found myself practicing Buddhist meditation techniques in order to convert the pain of viewing it into an opportunity for growth.  It would indeed be fair to say that watching About a Boy is a religious experience.If you want to see a dashing British comedy of errors about a romantic, bumbling idle young man, go rent an episode of Jeeves and Wooster.  It'll beat the socks off of this sad little movie any day of the week.",About a Boy

Good acting, good script, good music... a really enjoyable film.  Hugh Grant is perfect in the lead role and is surrounded by an equally great supporting cast. The film is funny, touching, and just plain fun. I left the theatre in a really good mood. I can't remember the last time a movie's done that to me.

140,smithpaulusmc,"Strong Story, Poor Adaptation",3,10 December 2018,"Aptly named protagonist and bachelor, Will Freeman (Hugh Grant), disputes the claim ""No man is an island"" in the 2002 comedy About A Boy. He believes that one can venture through life's halls without having any serious or meaningful relationships. Yet, Will Freeman's assumptions are tested when young Marcus Brewer (Nicholas Hoult) enters his life. Through a series of unfortunate events and somewhat genuine attempts at reform, Will embarks on a journey that could change him forever.About A Boy is a nice adaptation of the equally named 1998 novel. At its best, it offers a glimpse at the necessity in quality human interaction to prevent depression and suicide. At its worst, it is a corny, ill-paced, Hallmark Channel-esque rip off. Nicholas Hoult's performance as young Marcus Brewer is not astounding, but it maintains a level of honesty while directing the flow of the story. Hugh Grant is, well, Hugh Grant. What he lacks in depth he makes up with that old British charm and a musical performance.The film's dialogue succeeds when it employs casual banter and awkward scenarios between Will and Marcus. But, other than basic sound editing for room tone, there is nothing special within. This film is all about character development and story. This works well in novel format, but the transition to the big screen leaves the eyes and ears wanting. As for the ensemble, the characters are believable for their environment, but there is little or no energy.About A Boy, did however offer material on which I could ponder. It ably taught the valuable lesson: people need people. For its discussion on family matters and depression, it gets an A. As for all other requisites, About A Boy requires summer school.",About a Boy

He is not actually a parent.Yet, even as he denies it, there is within him a longing to fill a shallowness which he calls comfort. The story develops around Will's growth as an adult, helped by a boy's plain-spoken natural wisdom. While the flick gets its laughs off the original premise, it develops into a feel-good light drama rather than a laugh-a-minute farce.The boy's mother, Fiona, is flawed-- suicidal in fact-- and generally unlikely material for a romantic lead. Yet, she upholds her dignity as an individual even while she is being torn down by self-destructiveness.Around 2/3rds through this film, it occurred to me that even Hollywood--so able to find humanity in the strangest places--might not in the materialistic America of the 2000's elevate Fiona, but that the UK remains after all a socialist country in which perhaps meaning can still survive despite poverty. For that matter, in the U.S. the film never would have gotten around a man privately associating with a young boy. This film is somewhat in the tradition of social realism.

142,obiwan2005,I love this movie,10,18 August 2003,"'About a Boy' is not what you'd expect from the people who brought you 'American Pie' and 'High Fidelity'. It has tremendous heart. Will (played by Hugh Grant) is a slacker who lives off royalties of his father's one hit song. Through a series of sleazy events (he joins a single parent group to meet loose chicks) he meets a boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hault) who is going through a crisis. His mom is suicidal and he realizes if she goes, he'll be all alone. So he starts hanging out with Will in an attempt to make a friend to lean on. Will takes to Marcus and becomes sort of a mentor of coolness (Marcus's mother is a hippie, so she doesn't know what's what). Eventually Will takes Marcus for granted and realizes that he is only a shell of a man, who is nothing without his friend Marcus. The movie's moral is 'No man is an Island' and that you need people in your life to make it worthwhile. From the directors of 'American Pie' and the Author of 'High Fidelity'. Hugh Grant is very charming in this and all the performances are wonderful. Stays very true to the great book, while changing the ending (which is better in the film). This a surprise movie that has become one of my favorites, because it's funny and heartwarming in a non-cornball kind of way.**** out of ****",About a Boy

It was hillarious and heart-warming at the saem time. It had witty dialouge and likeable charactors.It follows the story of shallow yuppie Will (Grant).  He's basicly just the regular sometimes cliched selfish man until he meets Marcus (Hoult), a young quiet young boy.  Marcus isn't popular at school and doesn't really have any friends other than his mom, Fiona (Collette).  After a lot of scamming and lying to women, Will finally starts realizing what a cynical jerk he is, with the help of Marcus.  The funny thing about thier situation is the happier Marcus gets (once he gets friends and recognition, with the help of Will) the more depressed Will gets.  In the end they need to help each other to all be happy.The acting is delightful.  Grant gives the performance of his lifetime (sorry to say it doesn't mean much).  Toni Collette is fabulous (is she really British?).  And Hoult is also good (was he wearing lipstick?).  All in all this movie is charming and funny.

It didn't ring true with me at all, in any way.I appreciate that it is a moral fable, but it is incredible when Marcus gets a crush on a badly acted post punk wannabee, and she takes to him and becomes his girlfriend. This just makes no sense at all. It isn't real life folks.And then the concert...What happens when Marcus goes back to school the next week?Will he be the new hero, or the former target of abuse.Place your bets.(Ignoring the ""bolt on"" happy ending of the film)Uplifting it may try to be, but I was left depressed by the glib, patronising, moralising vacuousness of it all.Loved ""Hi-Fidelity"", but was completely unimpressed by this.Cheers, Will",About a Boy

The scripting and character plots were simply brilliant. This is a witty movie of substance and humour and deserves a perfect rating in my books.Hugh Grant performed his role well and was quite convincing. I know how it is to be approaching the 30's, without a real girlfriend with no definite plans of marrying anyone, and not be established in any way as a person with something going to really talk about.Personally, I'm not ready for any real relatoinship, but when everyone else around you has either married someone, or has a girlfriend then you feel weird. I imagine being 38 would be allot worst - unemployed and no girlfriend or family. Immediately, when I saw that intro-picture, I knew this movie was meant for me and felt involved with the characters.It had elements of trying to succeed with women, similar in themes to ""Hitch"", where a prop of being a single dad is used to score on would be single mom's. It appears that creating a fictitious child could score well on hitting on a single mom to shag her - if you could keep the story together. I thought the whole skit was bold and very convincing. However, I don't think I would try that myself to try and get a girl. However, in this movie, Hugh won the jackpot in the end.Rated 10/10.",About a Boy

147,Cantoris-2,I couldn't have written this without seeing it,9,28 May 2002,"Critics who have seen many more films than I agree that this is among the smartest, most delightful comedies of this or any recent year.  Especially refreshingly, this distinction comes the old-fashioned way: with a solid and intelligent script, fine acting, and direction with a sense of-- well, direction.  We see an honest, intimate comedy of manners, with no overlay of untoward pretentions like flashy special effects or a budget to vie with third-world countries.Furthermore, its release date is a fittingly cheeky gesture itself, juxtaposing this tidy little work of art with its opposite, a sprawling, spectacular episode of Star Wars.  The world is, alas, not always a reasonable place, but there is no *reason* why it should thereby suffer from its competition at the hands of anyone who attends more than one movie per season.  There are various sorts of good movie. If perchance two are showing simultaneously, is it too much to expect that we see one and return for the other next weekend, blessing our good fortune and storing up such unaccustomed pleasure in one's hump?  Treks between the desert's oases seem to lengthen over time.But now to differ a little with the critics: I even sympathized with the character of Will.  A ""blank""? Yes, seemingly he is.  But ""a bastard"", whom audiences ""love to hate""? Where have folks been since 9/11? ""First do no harm"" is a similarly blank, or negative precept, yet as a basic ethical hurdle it fells many even whom we don't usually love to hate.  I suggest beginning with it.Will stands in the tradition of generations of ladies and gentlemen of leisure who live quietly in their homes and let others do likewise. Further, awhile back we all might have enjoyed the reminiscent comedies of, say, Noel Coward, who portrayed such with a smile, complete with equally creative strategems to beguile the opposite sex.  As for us, typically we save up because by age 65-- or 60 if we can possibly manage-- our life's ambition is to attain to Will's situation; whereas he is, shall we say, retired at 38. There gapes the gulf between us.Yeah, Will likes his sports car (although not too much to consign it to a daft woman when rushing out to save a daft boy), but apparently he doesn't habitually burn up irreplaceable resources gallivanting around the world in jets or yachts.  Such self-indulgence, hardly confined to the leisure class anymore, irreversibly deprives all posterity of not only energy but plastic. Otherwise, money that passes through his albeit frivolous hands cyclically provides employment and livelihood to others, making his lifestyle no more malign than that of most Londoners.Meanwhile, Will schemes no scams to weasel into the wallets of unsuspecting fellow citizens.  He is not selling drugs.  He doesn't blow up buildings or teach kids to kill Jews under the pretext of some exotic religion.  We might wish that he weren't quite so stand-offish for so long towards the lonely and needy like Marcus (who, I agree, with most but not all, is nicer than Will).  But, then, to such lengths one must go nowadays to ensure that gestures towards the young aren't misunderstood.  Good-old Will even passes that test-- under the eagle eye of a mother who, over this issue, suddenly jolts herself out of her free-thinking, nostalgic, bipolar haze into a shocked vigilance, in the finest tradition of properly instructed, up-to-date 'parenting.'In the sense that these scenes don't fit her character, they don't work. But I bet the directors knew and intended this incongruity full well. Given the Stygian streams that cultural spelunkers James Kincaid and Judith Levine have mapped at last, and the ritual coin in the mouth for the boatman before contemporary audiences can sit back and enjoy an intergenerational relationship, theirs was so abrupt and blatent as to constitute satire.  As Marcus would trill, this stroke was ""brilliant!"" Quentin Crisp would agree, who advised: if and when you must start going bald, the cool thing to do is shave your head.So, by today's real standards (i.e., divested of vestigial Marxist lip service), we have, er, what to hate in Will Freeman? Two generations ago we admired undisguised leisure and a modicum of independent wealth.  Now, our blue noses ever to whomever's grindstone, we affect to despise them.  If this change came from living in a society become generally freer, more just, more promising, and more gracious than then, I'd agree: fair enough, goodbye and good riddance to Will and all his ilk.  But that is not what I see outside theaters.  Do you?Does the inferred distaste arise from the fact that-- unlike countless others who live too high on the hog to maintain straight-faced that they earn their keep, however chronically ""stressed-out"" they may become on behalf of their chosen standard-- Will is a *single man*? Does a T-shirt glimpsed in the film's first minutes say it all? ""Lorene Bobbitt for Surgeon General"" reads the chest of a woman obviously eager to proclaim her independence from men, but perhaps less eager to return men the favor.From Hollywood's ghoulies and ghosties, long-leggedy beasties, things that go bump in the night, and earnest turning-over-new-leaves by dramatically converted protagonists, good Lord deliver us, as the Weitzes have already done.  Not for them the conjuration of lightning flashes. Freemasonry, it is said, quietly takes good men and makes them better. Once he'd doggedly pounded his way in, 12-year-old Marcus quietly took a blank man and made him good.  I'm happy.  Maybe even, someday, Will Freeman Will Freemason, but that's another movie (always leave room for a sequel, in which he could even defy American-imperialist bugaboos enough to give Marcus a hug the next time the kid fears for his mother's life).  Meanwhile, both man and boy-- or is it both boys-- could do worse.  Like most movies.",About a Boy

They definitely have to give out Oscars for performances like Hugh Grant's. Unfortunately, ""light comedy/drama"" doesn't cut it with the Academy. To date, Colin Firth and John Cusack have taken shots at Nick's classic ""stunted emotional man trying to connect to real life without props (Pop, Arsenal, etc.)"" but Hugh's is the best. Toni Collette also did extremely well, making a role that could have been laughable have real resonance by the end. I think I enjoyed the film so much because, paradoxically, I didn't connect to the book the way I did to Fever Pitch and High Fidelity. I just took it as a movie, rather than as an adapted version of something very close to my heart. The only downside? It lost half a point for the ""guitar at school"" scene, which seemed to be pasted into the screenplay to give Will a chance to absorb humiliation on behalf of Marcus.

It's not just that Grant and Collette and Hoult are so brilliant in their roles. It's the mix of comedy and genuine pathos, the identification with the characters, the mix of laughter and tears, the feeling of being stunned at the restaurant scene when Grant, humiliated, lets loose with the truth while the boy watches, astounded - so many riveting scenes, so much exceptional dialogue.I loved this film - a 10/10",About a Boy

Will is a fine creation - an empty, shallow and selfish man, but deep down there's a good person who just needs to make a real connection with someone. Nicholas Hoult was also excellent as Marcus and the film manages to amuse and move without descending into overt sentimentality. The 'Killing Me Softly' ending is a classic.

155,pc_dean,The Urbane Jungle,8,27 May 2002,"""About a Boy"" is the story of a superficial hipster who discovers his humanity, who comes to learn of his need and capability to love, through a paternal relationship to a troubled young boy.Even so, it's still worth watching.Will Freeman (get it?) is a London man-about-town who has raised superficiality to a form of high art.  He has no job, no interests, no close friends.  He lives off the royalties from a song his late father wrote years before (it's not a very good song, either, and watching Will's reaction as it stalks him everywhere he goes is a lot of fun).  Will's time is filled with nothing: he watches TV, he has his hair done, he plays pool, he chases women, but he has no substantive existence.  And that's just how he likes it.He hits upon a scheme to focus his skirt-chasing on young single mothers, who are eager for male attention but skittish about emotional commitment. This plan brings him into contact with 12-year-old Marcus, a bright but miserable kid who divides his time between torture at school and his unstable home life with his hippie mom (Toni Collette).  Marcus decides he needs a backup support system, and schemes by persistence and blackmail to recruit Will as a surrogate father.The scenario lends itself to being a kind of post-modern ""Parent Trap"": cute kid brings together two people who are just so gosh-darn perfect for each other that the only reason they aren't together is that they have to drag it out so the audience can finish its popcorn.  But this movie refuses to follow any easily-spotted pattern, and there are too many other characters and relationships spinning in its orbit anyway.  ""About a Boy"" takes any number of relationship comedy ideas, any one of which could have its own pedestrian high-concept movie built around it, and mixes them , blender-like, into its narrative.  It keeps all these balls in the air by maintaining an extremely sharp and witty edge.  In the saccharine world of change-your-heart movies, it's a big shot of insulin.  But in being so, it manages to beat the sweeties at their own game: its moments of emotional weight are all the more effective because we're not under constant empathy fatigue.To look at Hugh Grant, even in the movies where he plays insufferably cute, is to see a man who could brilliantly portray a rat fink, since he seems to have a lot of experience (just ask Elizabeth Hurley).  And his Will is a virtuoso of callow self-involvement.  He doesn't kid himself; he is content in his shallowness, as his caustic and funny narration makes clear (being that empty apparently requires a great deal of self-knowledge).  It is this narration that is one of the best parts of Grant's performance: his onscreen reactions are in perfect synch with his offscreen words, which makes his internal monologue a vital part of the movie instead of a clunky device. Grant expertly walks a tightrope between pathos and obnoxiousness, since if he were too likable or too nasty, he wouldn't hold our interest the way he does.Naturally, Will's shallowness is a mask for some deep and roiling emotions that he refuses to deal with, regarding his father and his upbringing (and that freakin' song).  This is nicely understated: we are never subjected to teary emotional confessions or wrenching anecdotes on his part.As Marcus, Nicholas Hoult creates a presence to match Grant's.  The boy is both smart and troubled, but they don't become the kind of overbearing cardinal traits that usually dominate and define children in movies.  His most prominent characteristic is a kind of morose calculation: he doesn't gravitate toward Will out of sentiment or affection, but just decides that he needs some ""backup"" and figures that, realistically, Will is what he has to work with.  And work he does: the movie lets us watch as a relationship based on mutually beneficial deceit gradually and almost defiantly becomes real and deep.  Hoult's interior monologue is almost as funny as Grant's. It reveals a kid who has grown up fast, who is wry and self-aware but still, and palpably, just a kid.As Marcus's mom, Toni Collette sheds the maternal seriousness and scientific stare that have become a sort of trademark for her in movies like ""Changing Lanes"" and ""The Sixth Sense"".  Her role isn't too big, but she gives us a compelling portrayal of loving but freaked-out instability with the screen time she has.  Only Rachel Weisz fails to make much impression, as a love interest of Grant's: she's not bad, but it's tough playing a late-coming and slightly underwritten character, when everyone around you is so good.The script by Nick Hornby and Peter Hedges is clever and fast-moving, so much so that at the end of the movie, you are impressed by the sheer amount of things that happen in ""About a Boy"".  Directors Chris and Paul Weitz (the ""American Pie"" guys!) keep things going at a brisk pace, with a minimum of showy camera work, though there is a rotating pan of Hoult in the schoolyard that is beautifully executed and well-placed.  It deftly evokes self-involved urban cool, the terrors of junior high, the pain of missing pieces in your life, and the peculiar joys of families, ersatz and otherwise.  Though the story strains its own believability at times (it's hard to figure how Grant gets into all these parties if he doesn't know anyone and just mostly watches TV), it charms its way to forgiveness, or at least acceptance.  Its lessons are familiar, but nicely rendered:  Everybody needs backup.  Everybody has something to offer other people.  And sometimes, you just have to get out there and sing Roberta Flack with your eyes closed.I'm pretty sure they meant that last part metaphorically.  No, seriously, stop that.  Please.",About a Boy
156,thirdi,"About a surprising, outstanding movie",10,1 March 2005,"About a boy kind of flew under the radar for me as I'm sure it did for many others. I finally got around to seeing it recently on DVD and I can say with much certainty that it's one of the best comedies I've seen in a long time. I guess I was expecting a typical sort of Hugh Grant romantic comedy, but it's nothing like that at all. I found it very similar in tone to movies like Rushmore and even American Beauty, but with a lot more laughs than either of those dramedies.I've never felt too strongly one way or another about Hugh Grant, but he is spot-on perfect in this film as a rich bachelor who lives off his father's money and doesn't have a care in the world. He prides himself on living a life of luxury and comfort, and avoiding complicated relationships. Cleary one of his best performances, Grant's interpretation of Will is shallow and cynical but layered with potential. By chance, he enters the life of a depressed single mother (Toni Collette) and her 12 year old son (Nicholas Hoult) who is in desperate need of some type of a male role model. There's a lot going on and several different sub-plots but essentially events unfold that further entangle Will into these people's lives. And ultimately he must decide if he is going to withdraw to his posh apartment and stay disconnected from people, or face the music and accept that truly no man is an island.Nicholas Hoult also gives a very strong performance for a first time actor. This is one of those films where every actor seems to be the ideal choice for the character they play, right down to the smallest roles. The moments of hilarious comedy are nicely balanced with a serious, at times melancholy, story. I'm sure there are some deep lessons here about how families can be created in all kinds of different circumstances, and are not always defined by bloodlines alone. Or about maturity, growing up, and finding meaning in life. All of that is probably true, but at the end of the day About a Boy is just a very enjoyable, funny movie that is well worth an hour and a half. An awesome soundtrack too makes this a must see film.",About a Boy
157,Jenny Ho,"Good book, shame about the film",6,3 June 2002,"Hugh Grant plays Will, a man in his late thirties who has never needed to work since he has been able to live off the royalties from a song his father wrote in the 1960s.  His relationships with women never last more than two months with no job or proper relationship, Will has never had any need for responsibility.  This changes when he joins a single parent group (Will does not have a child but he uses the group's meetings as a scheme for meeting single women).  At a single parent group picnic, he is brought into contact with Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) a twelve year old who lives alone with his suicidal mother (Toni Collette) and is bullied regularly at school.  The film tells the story of how friendship develops between man and boy.In this film, we have a hip and cool Hugh Grant: he has a new short haircut and trendier clothes.  Yet again, he comes across on screen as extremely likeable and it is difficult to imagine anyone else playing the part of Will.  One problem I had was difficulty in warming to Nicholas Hoult's performance.  He is a pretty average actor and I suspect that we are unlikely to see him on screen again.  Since the story is all about the relationship between Will and Marcus, Grant has a lot to carry and he simply is not provided sufficient support to make the film as a sure-fire comedy classic as it would initially appear on paper.  The film uses narrative voice-over by the two principle actors which serves to replace Nick Hornby's written word.  This seems unnecessary at times and I often found the voice-overs an irritation, particularly in the case of Hoult who fails to convince with his emotions. I had high expectations for the cinematic adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel and I think my familiarity with the book is probably the reason why I left the cinema feeling slightly disappointed.",About a Boy

160,yaseminturkish,"Hugh Grant proves that he has more than a good agent, but where is everyone who adored 'Bridget Jone's Diary?'",9,17 February 2003,"Hollywood was giddy with pride about `Bridget Jone's Diary' last year and the film which was adequate if fairly pedestrian, even garnered an Academy Award nomination for Renee Zellweger.  Funny how you don't hear those same people in Hollywood cheering for `About A Boy' this year, though it finally proves that playboy Hugh Grant is a real star and not just a pretty face with a good agent.  Sadly enough, `About A Boy' is a film that you tell your friend about and despite being a Hugh Grant fanatic, she's oblivious to it's existence.  It can only mean that Hollywood would rather invest in toilet humor and sequels of now rotten films, than back originality thats fit for the entire family.  Possible SpoilersIs it really possible that a few short years ago, the directors of this far superior film were destroying their reputations with the American Pie debacle?  It goes to show you that even the most clueless directors can turn mediocrity into brilliance when the public whom they cater to, desires it. Who knew that they had this level of talent or that they'd be intelligent enough to adapt `About A Boy' from the author of the also fabulous `High Fidelity,' another sleeper hit from 2000.   `About A Boy' is actually about two boys who find that puberty is an unfortunate calamity.  For Will (Grant) puberty presents the problem of coming to terms with the conclusion that `no man is an island.'  There is a sort of brilliance in casting Grant in this role as one has to believe that he's basically playing himself.Toni Collette continues to churn out great roles but she never receives the credit given to names like Julia Roberts and Nicole Kidman.  Most people remember her from `The Sixth Sense' (if at all) but I'd say that it's highly unlikely that they'd recall her starring role in `Muriel's Wedding.'  As vegetarian hippie mom Fiona, Collette does some of her best work.Nicholas Hoult could be the next child star going the route of Anna Paquin, Tatum O'Neal, and Haley Joel Osment.  I really enjoyed the KidzRock scenes with Grant and Hoult, who proves that he's not one of the movie/sitcom kids who goes upstairs never to be seen again while mom and dad engage in their usual banter.  I think that if he continues to choose the right roles and finds an adequate hairstyle, he'll be the next superstar.`About A Boy' really surprised me.  I came in expecting another vehicle where Hugh Grant falls in love despite his caddish ways and was surprised that instead the chemistry was between Grant and a pubescent, needy child. Scenes with the KidzRock contest, the duck situation, and the mother who loved it when her son sang for her were brilliant and inspired.  Much of the excellence of this film must be credited to Hedges who proves that `High Fidelity' wasn't the only story he wanted to tell.9/10",About a Boy
161,dav7nine,Good stuff,7,12 November 2004,"I really liked this film. I didn't think it would be as good as it was, and that's because of a terrible feeling I have about Hugh Grant. There's just something about him... that... I don't know how to describe it. I think it's to do with the fact that he always plays the 'same-ish floppy-haired Englishman'. But when I stop and think about it... Four weddings is alright, and he's actually quite funny. Notting Hill is alright... and this was really good. Maybe I should give him a break!The story all revolves around the 12 year-old (Marcus), and the fact that he (and his mother) don't have any 'back-up' in life. Will (Hugh Grant) realizes that he doesn't either, although he's got enough money and a comfortable life. So he decides to change this... and the rest is history. Best line in the film is Will explaining to Marcus ""Look, I can't help you, leave me alone.... I can help you pick trainers or... music but I can't help you with anything that means anything!"" - hahaha - class!Really good film that left me with something to think about: Do I have any 'back-up'?7/10",About a Boy
162,charbrom,"Read Hornby, don't watch his work on film",5,7 June 2002,"It very rarely happens that a movie, based on a successful novel, can live up to the expectations. And yet again this theory is proved. Because 'About a Boy' is just an ok, well made film that almost never excites as much as the book by Nick Hornby. Some moments are funny, others sad and in the end the makers did their job. But that isn't supposed to their main goal. They have to at least show us why they thought it was necessary to turn it into a film. And they never did in my opinion. So if you want to have an ok time, see the film. If you really want to enjoy yourself, read the book. Same goes for the other Hornby-novels-turned-into-films 'Fever Pitch' and 'High Fidelity'. 5/10",About a Boy

165,kwongers,Hugh Grant shines; great coming-of-age movie; bloody hilarious and touching at the same time,10,17 June 2005,"In the wonderfully entertaining ""About A Boy,"" Hugh Grant shucks everything that made him famous nearly a decade earlier in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (the floppy hair, the stuttering, etc.) and ends up giving his best performance to date. He plays Will, a wealthy, happily unemployed, commitment-phobic cad (slightly less insidious than Daniel Cleaver of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"") whose newest ploy is to date single mothers because they are easier to dump. However, he meets Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the son of a somewhat suicidal mother (Toni Colette), and realizes that he cannot continue living his life so shallowly.This film was based on Nick Hornby's wonderful book of the same name and retains much of the wit and touching humor. The early scenes depicting Will's ""full,"" but spiritually empty, life are particularly amusing, with Will dividing the day up into units of time and spending these units on ""web-based research"" (finding pics of supermodels with see-through tops), ""exercise"" (shooting pool), grooming, and the like. Grant makes his character irresponsible, but remains enormously likable throughout the film. This is important because we start to identify with him, and understand his fears of commitment and helplessness behind his outward superficiality. His mannerismsGrant's specialty, I thinkare v. entertaining to watch; the selfishness, hurt, anger, recognition and more pass across his face effortlessly. The other cast members Nicholas Hoult, Toni Colette, and Rachel Weisz  are also v. good in their supporting roles and play off each other well.The film doesn't follow the book too closely, however, but does one-up on the book by wisely emphasizing some parts that the book downplays. For example, Rachel (played by Rachel Weisz) only appears for a few pages in the book, but has much more presence in the movie. Through the Rachel character, we see how Will's relationship with her is different from his past shallow ones, and we realize that he is growing up. Also, the movie is filled with great one-liners and sharp, witty dialogue that never feels forced. The movie also employs voice-over function (Will's) very nicely; for example, in one serious scene, Will follows the ambulance to the hospital, looking rather serious, but in his voice-over he says. ""It was all terrible, just terrible. But driving fast behind the ambulance was fantastic."" The character would never say that out loud, but it provides comic relief and the assurance that he is, indeed, very shallow.The strength of ""About a Boy"" is in the simplicity and power of its scenes. Not one scene is wasted; each one tells us a wealth about the characters and leads to Will's self-discovery. That, along with Hugh Grant's delightful performance, and backed by a great score from Badly Drawn Boy, make ""About A Boy"" one of the most delightful, entertaining, and touching movies I've seen. It's a great feel-good movie. Highly recommended, especially to Hugh Grant fans, or anyone who has ever empathized or sympathized with Will and his situation. One of my favorites. 10/10.",About a Boy

A movie about a man who is basicly headed nowhere until he comes in contact with a young boy who changes his life.

Along the way he meets up with a 12 year old who shows him how to be a grown up. Grant is at his most charming and the movie is very subdued. Toni Colette plays the young boys mom and Rachel Weisz is the vexing older girl for Marcus. It is this relationship in the movie that brings smiles to the viewer.

173,LLinus,About this movie..,6,25 September 2013,"About a boy, is a dramatic, romantic comedy which is directed by the brothers Chris Weitz and Paul Weitz. It's about a man named Will Freeman who has no interest in children, long lasting relationship or responsibility what so ever. But is in for a ride when he meets Marcus, a boy in need for a male role model and a third family member, since his mother is mentally unstable and Marcus figures, she needs a man in her life.The actors i feel worth mentioning, who made their performance believable and shook life in their characters were Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and Fiona Brewer (Toni Colette). Nicholas doesn't get by on cute looks, like far too many kid actors, because he can actually act and shows that child actors are just as, if not more so, capable as their elders. Toni Colette, convincing as a mentally unstable single mother, you can nothing but feel empathy for her characters mental situation, it has come to a point in her life were nothing could make her happy. She was nothing more than adaptable to her characters life crisis.About the message of this movie, it's always hard to tell exactly since i don't think its ever written in stone, there are many views on just that subject. My view is, children of divorced parents, and how this is hard on both the child and the parent. It could also be about the difficulties of growing up in a society where it's hard to find who you really are, without following the crowd, you might get beaten, or bullied, but at least you're creating your own path.",About a Boy
174,zordy,the everlasting debate: book vs. film,7,17 September 2002,"A distinguished film critic said once that you should forget a film is taken from a book and consider what you're watching in itself. The problem for the one who actually makes the film is quite different, of course. For this film (and also for High Fidelity) the problem seems to be how to convey Hornby's flavour on film. And the solution is always the same: voice off. In High Fidelity it wasn't off actually, for the actor spoke to camera, but that's just a trick. In this case, we hear characters thoughts in first person (in the book is on third: quite a difference) and that's where all the fun comes from. Once again, it's Hornby who deserves credit: and though I've liked and laughed a lot, it seems to me this About A Boy on screen lacks something to be a good film and not a good transposition. Hugh Grant is better than usual, good casting, good pace. A big flaw: the bit with Hugh with guitar is cheap slapstick mixed with an evident will to make tears shed.",About a Boy

Toni Collette's suicidal character was a bit over the top but everyone else in the film did a superb job.

The writing is TERRIFIC (although we really aren't surprised by anything in the plot), and the actors are first-rate - virtually without exception. This is perhaps Hugh Grant's best performance, and the other actors - particularly the numerous younger actors - really couldn't be better. But I couldn't help feeling that they couldn't quite decide how to shoot a lot of the scenes, because in a few pivotal scenes (Toni Collette's confrontation with Grant late in the film, for example), they kept cutting back and forth between about 4 or 5 camera angles. I know it seems like nitpicking but it really annoyed me while watching, almost to the point of having a disorienting effect. In another scene, the camera kept gliding back and forth between two actors across a table from one another, and I felt I was going to start getting seasick if it went on very long. Maybe they shot scenes from a lot of angles, and then tried to keep the best moments from all the different shots and it ended up getting really choppy; I really don't know. But I do know that I found most of the camerawork really uninspired, certainly much less so than in Notting Hill.The film was cut by the same editor (Nick Moore) who did Notting Hill and The Full Monty (both of which had a much smoother rhythm than this one), though I suspect he probably did the best with what he had.. The cinematographer (Remi Adefarasin) previously worked on a number of top projects, including Elizabeth (which also struck me as having too much overly busy camera movement), and Band of Brothers (on which he probably shot a ton of footage from countless angles). My best guess is that a couple of young directors (the Weitzes, coming off a really dreadful movie) got a little overwhelmed by a cinematographer who had all kinds of ideas about camera tricks and angles.

181,dgoody,Less than the sum of it's parts,6,9 May 2002,"Early on in 'About a boy' the opinion is ventured that `no man is an island'. At the same stage I was wondering when `romantic comedy' became a euphemism for 'inoffensive date movie'. The film shed little light on the facts behind either theory, but succeeded in proving them both as true and unchangeable as rush hour traffic. The story follows Will, a fashionable layabout with no cares in the world, and Marcus, a 12-year old boy with a manically depressed hippy for a mother whose school life makes a working week in a sweatshop seem attractive. The unlikely pair end up together when Will's plan to date single mothers for some hassle free relationships backfires in the most ironic way possible. We are then treated to the usual selection of writer Nick Hornby's pop culture observations and comic characterisations of nerdy males having to contend with the concept of a serious relationship and real life. Whilst the electric prose of his debut 'Fever Pitch' has faded through his later works Hornby still has the power to leave a readers jaw hanging in the breeze by having his generally likeable protagonists commit truly nasty acts. It is this risk taking and realism that gives his writing an edge. Unfortunately the film adaptations of his books merely see him as the new Cameron Crowe, and 'About A Boy' offers a double jackpot with the smart arse kiddie factor that was so successful in Jerry Maguire and Almost Famous. It is depressingly predictable that the casting tells you everything you need to know about the film. Hugh Grant can make a mass murderer seem like an amusingly misunderstood guy, so his portrayal of Will seems charming to the point of sainthood, whilst Rachel Weitz may as well have 'attractive love interest' stapled to her forehead the way the make-up and lighting departments have obviously fawned over her. Grant's spiky hair cut and characterisations can't stop the audience warming to him, where someone like Richard E Grant could have given the character real sleaze, anger and most of all depth. Such safe playing production touches smother the original touches of the film. The homespun soundtrack, completely composed by Badly Drawn Boy, is cut so slickly into the film it starts sounding like a selection from Time Life music 'acoustic love moods' CD. This wrecks the rare pleasure of having a maverick songwriter given creative control over a movies entire soundscape (at Hornby's request no less). Toni Collete's gutsy performance as Marcus' mother is edited down to little more than a hippy-chic cameo of her Muriel's Wedding persona and idiosyncratic touches such as man and boy bonding over Countdown are poorly handled. If this wasn't enough to send the viewers higher brain functions to sleep we are given not one but two voiceovers in the film to make sure every nuance of every performance is clearly explained with no hint of ambiguity, thereby killing off any depth that accidentally may have been left in the film. Despite this Grant's charm carries the film safely to it's conclusion with a few belly laughs along the way. But this never excuses the fact that the film lacks the consistency of jokes to survive as comedy or the emotive depth to work as drama. In short it is another film which has lead to the words `romantic comedy' describing films which are generally neither one nor the other.",About a Boy

Toni Collette was great as Fiona (Marcus's depressed and suicidal mother).
Finally, Hugh Grant as ""Will"" is very believable as a jaded, self-centered, do-nothing louse (albeit a cute one). It was fun to watch him find love and laughter with a young and geeky boy who befriends him happenstance.There are a few subtle references to Will's own childhood that I would have liked to see more of. This is obviously the core cause of his current state of being, and yet the director only gives us hints and innuendo. You get a sense there is a deep sadness in Will, but it is never fully explored. Too bad actually, because I think it would have helped the audience relate more to Will.

It's very exciting to find that a movie like this has been done nowadays.The only thing I disliked is that it could have been done suitable for all audiences if it didn't have some brief strong language. I always think that a perfect movie must be suitable for everybody (except in a very few exceptions), as the classic film makers showed us decades ago.Regarding photography and art direction, it has some interior scenes which I found very beautiful and inspiring, specially those in restaurants.By the way, if you have the DVD, don't miss the suppressed scenes. It has one which makes you understand the Ellie character (Nat Gastiain Tena) a lot better. Unfortunately they suppressed it from the movie because they considered it competed against the main characters relationships.I voted it 9/10. I think it's a bit too high for my usual ratings, but the nowadays lack of this kind of movies makes me feel obligated to vote it 9/10.

This is a very well-directed movie. I suspect the target audience who will appreciate this movie will either have children, or be at least 30 years old.I would not have appreciated this movie when I was 25 years old.This movie is surprisingly well-directed. The acting is very good, with characters coming into the story that can make you believe this story is an actual documentary. But it's not.I won't give away any of the story, as it's well worth learning on your own.But I am a bit surprised that this movie is rated PG-13. While it mostly fits into this category, it does have scenes which only an older audience who has experienced love and/or a man who is a late-in-life ""Player"" mentality. The topics of sex, which the main male character seemingly sugar-coats over the real cravings of an adult, will probably be lost on the younger crowd, if not deemed inappropriate for the younger crowd.The discussion boards for this movie have proved this.

189,pronoun36,Cliched but Focused,8,24 March 2019,"Starring Hugh Grant and Nicholas Hoult, About A Boy is (for lack of a better term) about a boy who's depressed mother recently attempted suicide. The boy Marcus, played by Nicholas Hoult, befriends a grown man played by Hugh Grant. The man doesn't seem to have an agenda with life other than lounging around and hooking up with women. However, as Marcus forces himself into the man's life and even his home, the two begin to form an almost brother-like relationship and realize the importance of life and all that mushy stuff that warms the hearts of audiences. I have to give a lot of credit to Nicholas Hoult who, despite his age, delivers a very honest performance that fits perfectly with the written character. I really loved watching him interact with his mother played by Toni Collette. I never for a second doubted these two were not mother and son. They were a joy to watch and deserve a lot of credit for their work. Hugh Grant does a decent job as well, though not quite as emotional or authentic as Hoult or Collette. I also really admired the film's sense of humor. There are a lot of dark jokes that make the script stand out from other pictures of its genre. I liked that About a Boy never saw itself as too important to throw in humor, despite its disturbing subject matter such as depression and attempted suicide. The film does have a few issues, however. Toward the second half of the story, there are new characters introduced that I didn't find that memorable and I didn't see as important to the screenplay. I think the story would have held up fine if it revolved around the original core relationships. Additionally, there is a lot of narration in this film that, while occasionally funny and cleverly used, can also feel unnecessary given the classic ""show don't tell"" method of screenwriting. A few cliched moments are also thrown into the plot toward the film's climax. They're about as predictable as you would expect and they don't offer any originality. Though it's not a perfect film, I enjoyed About a Boy. I think the main characters and their relationships are written and performed superbly with the inclusion of very well written humorous moments. I recommend About a Boy for these reasons alone.",About a Boy
190,SunTzu-4,Very entertaining,10,26 April 2002,"Very well done.  Hugh Grant plays against type as a thoroughly-selfish individual who finds redemption through his (initially unwilling) friendship with a young boy.  This was extremely funny for those brought up in the English tradition of irony and self-deprecation so it may lose its audience on the other side of the Atlantic (except in New York and San Francisco): my companion, though, was Romanian and she found it hilarious -  so I may be taking too-jaundiced a line there.  Highly recommended: go and see it for no other reason than you'll be glad you did.",About a Boy
191,david_bixby,About as entertaining as I've seen in a while.,9,6 June 2002,"Based on the popular novel by Nick Hornby, About a Boy tells the story of Will Lightner (Grant).  Will is a self-absorbed confirmed bachelor living comfortably in his very chic, very roomy London flat.  As Will is occasionally forced to admit, he really does nothing for a living; his lifestyle is funded by the royalties he receives as a result of a very popular novelty Christmas song penned years ago by his father.Will lives his life as an island, careful to avoid the personal entanglements that would require him to shift his focus from himself.  He shops, he watches TV, he plays billiards, and he dates lots of women.  In his frequent, short-lived relationships, Will is able to take on whatever role he needs to become Mr. Right for a time.  Unfortunately, he can maintain each charade for only so long before he has to call it off, and then he is thrust into the most uncomfortable and very unwelcome role of bad guy.Will soon discovers what he believes to be an untapped source of commitment-free relationships: single moms.  Will invents a son for himself, and finagles himself a date through a support group for single parents. On his `date' he meets Marcus (Hoult), the painfully nerdy son of aging hippie, Fiona (Colette).Marcus initially latches onto Will as a potential husband for his mom; Fiona is emotionally erratic, and Marcus desperately wants to see her happy. The `magic', as they say, is just not there for Will and Fiona.  However, Marcus continues to visit Will's flat on his own, as an escape from the constant taunting at school and the emotional roller coaster at home.Will is initially resistant to this infringement on his insular existence, but he eventually begins to accept the visits and actually starts to interact with Marcus.  As Marcus becomes more of a fixture in Will's life, it slowly dawns on Will that he actually does care about somebody else's happiness: Marcus'.Hugh Grant really makes this movie.  He is delightfully shallow and cynical as Will, managing to step beyond his traditional role of the bumbling, hapless, hopeless romantic.   Some of his comments and asides should have you laughing out loud.  Nicholas Hoult does a good job as Marcus, (although he could work on his enunciation), and Toni Colette is appropriately annoying as the over-protective mother.",About a Boy

The movie brings talented acting, intelligent in-sights, humor, and reality to the screen.  It's difficult for us to read other reviews and find that some critics did not find enjoyment with this film.  So often, we don't get our money's worth when watching even the more expensively made films.  We can only say that this movie lifts the spirit and is one worth adding to a DVD collection.  To see the growth achieved by both a selfish bachelor on the prowl for single mothers and a young school boy in need of a father's input was wonderful.  The movie allows for character growth of not just the two main stars but also of those surrounding them.

His plumby accent also promotes a sort of stereotype for British people, which is pretty unfair - take the divine Sean Bean for a grittier model.There are two films in which I have been impressed by Hugh Grant. One is B J's diary - he seems to ring truer playing a nasty character. The other is in this film. In About A Boy, he is a lazy b*****d with few morals - the kind of person with more money than they deserve who annoys the rest of society, unless he's buying something expensive from your shop. Alone, this portrayal would be amusing. But what makes About A Boy great is the other characters in combination with this one.

196,Charles_LePoje,Nick Hornby's 1998 bestseller is turned into a funny and observant screenplay,8,19 June 2002,"Nick Hornby's 1998 bestseller is turned into a lively screenplay written and co-directed by Chris and Paul Weitz ( the raunchy ""American Pie""), also co-written by PeterHedges (a superb ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?""). The script compliments the classic Hornby sense of articulate Londoners driven by obsessive-compulsive pursuits. The peculiar creative powers behind the project turn out genuinely amusing and consistently entertaining film that boasts nicely rounded and amiable characters. By avoiding the syrup the picture doesn't fall into a predictable groove. It manages to avoid the banality of majority mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies but, regretfully, lacks the underlying philosophical concept(the brilliant ""GroundHog Day"") that could elevate it to a classic.There are two significant London-centered trilogies that originated in the 1990s. One - the Richard Curtis triptych of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Notting Hill"" and ""Bridget Jones's Diaries"" - has Hugh Grant starring in all of them. The other is the Nick Hornby trilogy of ""Fever Pitch"", ""High Fidelity"" and ""About a Boy"". Unlike in overpraised ""High Fidelity"", in which Stephen Frears, its British director (with John Cusack, a manic American equivalent to Grant) transferred that novel's plot from London to Chicago, the book's London setting is preserved here (apparently Chris Weitz has a first-hand understanding of English culture acquired during his studies at Cambridge).""About a boy"" - the name is a take on Nirvana's 'About a girl' - could have been titled just the same ""About Two Boys"". It is in essence a coming-of-age story squared. Not only is it about the smug and egocentric slacker and idle wealthy bachelor, Will Freeman, a character played by Grant, it is also about a pubescent loner dork, Marcus. Murcus' problems stem from his New Agey and seriously depressive mother who wishes to impose her rigid 1980s counter-cultural conformity on her son. Through his unlikely accord with Marcus, the story's catalyst, Will is eventually dragged kicking and screaming into the human race. Solipsists may be plugged into popular culture but they surely are utterly detached from actual people. 'Every man is an island' (Will lives his life as if his were Ibiza, a trendy European summertime playground ), but more often than not islands are invisibly connected into archipelagos. Island living may guarantee happy seclusion - 'Freeman' is all Will ever wants to be - but it also offers solitude and emotional retardation. ""The Will Show"" - aided by a series of great voice-over, self-satisfied pop referencing riffs - becomes an ""ensemble drama"". A cad ultimately is turned into a lad.Will's life springs into uncharted territory with the discovery of a brand new world of attention-starved single moms waiting to be conquered. Commitment is the enemy and single moms make good lays. Single mothers are less demanding and easier to dump than single girls. He infiltrates SPAT - Single Parents Alone Together - a pick-up heaven of perfect dating prey.Much of the film's success comes from Will Freeman's flashy politically incorrect characterization. He is a ""selfish b*****d"", in love with his lifestyle carefully scheduled into ""units"", with specific numbers of them allotted for one-night stands, expansive haircuts, cd-shopping, and watching TV game shows (It is not impossible that Hollywood may take notice of this phenomenon, leave studio cowardice aside and instead of endless and repetitive stream of anemic parts give us more colorful and unconventional characters). Hugh Grant brings Will's character to life in a grand manner. His versatile facial vocabulary, always with the hint of an edge, is fully tapped. Most male stars tend to be judged by their actions or the values they embody. With Grant, it is all about seeing thoughts and emotions cross and transform his face. Here, more subtly and convincingly than ever before. In ""About a Boy"", Grant is more than a star, he is a resource.With this handsome production The Weitz Bro's are now giving Cameron Crowe a run for his mainstream pop money.",About a Boy

200,denisejhale,See film before reading book to avoid disappointment.,7,4 May 2002,"Reading the book before seeing the film sets you up for a certain degree of disappointment. A book that has been part of your life for the best part of a week (or more) is reduced to one and a half hours of the main plotline. I had also misread the hype. The film is from the makers of Bridget Jones Diary; it is actually written and directed by two American guys, the Weitz Brothers. Their film credits include Antz (for which they wrote script) and America Pie. The plotline parallels the lives of two boys, thirty-five year old Will Freeman (Hugh Grant) and twelve year old Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). Will lives in a stylish apartment full of the latest technology and gadgets. His laidback lifestyle is funded by royalties from a novelty record his father wrote before he was born. He is happy drifting though life minimising his contact with others, except for the occasional sexual encounter. Marcus is not happy. He lives with his mother, a woman with strong beliefs who has been rendered emotional weak for reasons never fully explained. Eventually these two boys meet and a reluctant friendship develops.
Hugh Grant's performance is his best to date. His delivery of the narration, in a dry, sardonic style, hints of the hidden depths that he assures his friends do not exist. The film is very much his. Toni Collette gives an excellent performance as the alternate' single mother who fails to appreciate her son's problems. And, despite my aversion, to child actors Nicholas Hoult delivered a very credible performance as the child who is struggling to cope in environments he can not control. The casting of child actors seem to have gradually improved as producers (*see below) have endeavoured to provide real' children and not cute' or precocious' child stars.The film has its weaknesses. The best lines have been lifted from Nick Hornby's book. Whilst its first three-quarters adhere to the book, it then diverts into a crisis incident before concluding with a scene that is again Hornby territory. Whilst there is nothing wrong with this construction it wasn't quite enough. The magic is also missing in its humour, that is not to say it is not funny, it is, although not as roaringly so as the hype would have you believe. Perhaps I went to this movie knowing too much and expected something extra to be delivered. I exited with a feeling it was enjoyable but  Maybe Will's words express what I felt was missing, `Ah that's where you have me wrong. You've always thought I had hidden depths.

But when a date goes awry, he is sought after as a father-figure by a ""loser""-type 12 year old boy.  Of course, it's an old story:  he rejects the kid, is grudgingly won over, and they both end up growing as a result of the relationship.  About a Boy is actually about two boys.But while the story is cliche, the mastery is in the details.  Nicholas Hoult is good, and doesn't play the stereotypical sappy kid who's more mature than the adults; he's messed up.

I know it's hard to make a movie out of a book, especially when the book is so much based on presenting the characters' way of thinking. But still I think that the creators should  have tried harder. Or maybe their intention was to create a new type of e-book: 'movie-book'. If so, they've succeeded.",About a Boy

Everyone acted really well, I don't usually like Hugh Grant, but I started 2 respect him as an actor in Bridget Jones' Diary, now I have complete respect for him, he is such a talented actor even if all his previous film roles have made him look like a bumbling neanderthal!For the first time I had 2 fill out a questionnaire for the film company as audience feedback, one of the questions was 'would you recommend this to others?'

216,mrandy,A Real Winner...,9,8 June 2002,"""About A Boy"" is a wonderful movie.  Hugh Grant does a great job playing the blank, shallow Will who finally learns to connect with people when he meets 12 year-old Marcus.  I was hesitant to see ""About A Boy"" when I heard the directors of this film were the minds behind American Pie and American Pie 2 --although I can't bash those movies, I've never seen them. 
""About A Boy"" had several opportunities to become a cliche romantic comedy but never did -- it never took the easy way out.  The characters were fully developed and didn't do things way out of character, Bravo!  And that's the beauty of ""About A Boy"", the characters seem like they could be real people. They aren't caricatures of people.""About A Boy"" is a truly funny, entertaining, and touching movie that shouldn't be missed.  There are frustrating and embarrassing (can't look at the screen) parts of this movie (which makes it not perfect). If you liked High Fidelity (from the same author) or maybe even Notting Hill (but don't expect as much romance), I bet you'll like ""About A Boy"".  About A Boy is not an amalgam of those movies but it shares its sensibilities with them.It's a 9 out of 10 (A -)",About a Boy
217,johnnonz,another in the Hugh Grant genre....but....????,5,12 August 2002,"Hugh Grant, with 'Four Weddings and a Funeral' and 'Notting Hill' has made romantic comedy his own genre. This movie focuses on Will's relationship with a young boy, Marcus, and the romantic interest is peripheral. Nonetheless it retains more than enough of the formulaic elements of the Hugh Grant genre to retain interest. But that's all! This movie lacks the lustre of the earlier movies, and in places, seems tired, despite Grant's undeniable charm.",About a Boy

Hugh Grant displays an acting ability that I haven't seen in any of his other movies. The boy who plays Marcus is about as believable as could be; having been on the wrong end of popularity before, I could definitely relate to his character. Now Marcus's mother was a bit unbelievable. But I like the flow, the personal narration by the two main characters, and overall I would give the movie a 9.5-10.P.S. My wife really liked it too.

219,bollekeceuninx,Wrong starting point,4,19 September 2002,"Don't worry : this movie is (kind of) funny.  Usually when Hugh Grant is involved that's the one thing you can be reasonably sure about.  But whether this is a movie that will stay with you for longer than it takes to see it.... It's a pretty flimsy story about a guy who is basically happy.  Which is the first point of criticism : movies about happy people are mostly boring.  So, the script writer must have thought, let's start with a happy guy and make him unhappy. As the movie progresses the basic philosophy of the movie becomes clearer : the only way to happiness is by becoming the most average and mainstream character you can imagine.  Eccentric is wrong ! Mediocre is the highest good !  Because the main personage is happy being eccentric he has to be made aware of the fact that is actually unhappy because he is not like everyone else.  By the end he becomes like anyone else you've ever met and passed on the street and THUS must be happy. Very strange philosophy... One word about the young Nicholas Hoult : his character Marcus says he's not as good as Haley Joel Osmond and therefor has to go to school.  He's right about that alright.  I couldn't help but noticing that as the movie progresses the acting style of Nicholas starts to resemble mr. Grants' more and more.

Take your wife/girlfriend and earn some brownie points, but don't expect to be bowled over. The acting is solid, Hugh Grant plays himself, as usual, but just a little more self centered than normal for him. The mother, Toni Collette, is very good.

221,Hoshi Sato,Pretty good,7,15 January 2003,"I really hope this movie gets an Oscar nomination because it was so well made.  Hugh Grant plays Will, a 38 year old bachelor who has never worked a day in his life.  Nicholas Hoult plays Marcus, a 12 year old kid who needs some escape after witnessing his mother attempted suicide.  Apart, they are lost individuals.  But after a series of meetings and a little scheming by Marcus to hook Will up with his mother played by Toni Collette, both find themselves needing the other.  Their worlds are rocked and soon, Will finds himself unable to continue his bachelor life as before based on units of 1 or 30 mins.  When he meets Rachel, played by Rachel Weisz, Will is actually ashamed of being the person he was and continued his lie about being a single father because he now cares what other people think of him.  The film ends with Will spending Christmas dinner with Rachel and Will and his mum. And this is all because of a boy.  Although the movie is a dramatic-comedy if there is such a thing, it tends to move slowly and we do see their relationship developing over periods of probably months.  Hugh Grant was marvelous and gave probably the performance of his career as of date.  The production was good, the cast was superb, and the story-telling wasn't boring, albeit slow.  I give this film 7 out of 10 stars.",About a Boy
222,mdana,Best Movie of 2002 (So Far),9,27 May 2002,"I loved this movie.  I saw it on Saturday the week-end it came out with my wife and she loved it also.  The movie is great.  I would rank it with Fever Pitch as the best Nick Hornby film adaptation (High Fidelity was also great and I enjoy it more every time I see it).  Hugh Grant gives a great performance and doesn't do many of his tricks such as stuttering and fluttering his eyes that he sometimes has done in the past.  The child is amazing and practically perfect.  Toni Collete is also terrific.  The movie is really funny and at parts very dark and sad, but you leave the theater somehow happy and uplifted.  I really like the shallowness of Grant's character and the selfishness of Collette's character.  The movie portrayed them how they were and was not judging them to be bad people just a bit mixed up (like real people).  The voice-over of the boy's and Grant's characters were hilarious and pitch perfect for their emotional stages. The best scene is when the boy tries to play matchmaker with his mother and Will Freeman and you hear his take on what a great time they are having and Will's less optimistic view.  If you liked or loved this film check out Fever Pitch and High Fidelity, you will enjoy them too.  I would rank this movie, at least a 9 out of 10, maybe even a 10.",About a Boy

225,Eyke87,"Delightful, warm, funny movie void of the saccharine schmaltz of much American rubbish",8,3 January 2006,"It is not usual to call a movie lovely or just simply nice. This movie knows exactly what it is and to be fair is quite predictable but the tender, spot-on performance coupled with a very real script make About a Boy a winner from start to finish.The characters, start out as stereotypical cut-outs. Hugh Grant is the 21st century man, living alone with all his mod-cons and yet he does nothing. He does not have a job and lives off the royalties of a hit jingle written by his dad. Nicholas Hoult on the other hand is the archetypal geek who gets bullied at school and yet his mother is a suicidal depressant and he just wants a father figure.The relationship between the two characters is built slowly and carefully with both Grant and Hoult helping each other to be better people. Contrasting from the hilarious to the downright tragic. About a Boy is simply a good film about good people and so what if its predictable, these are characters who you cannot help but care about.Both Hoult and Grant are standouts in a cast that includes Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, Hoult especially being adept at comedic and emotional situations: You cannot help but feel for him as he stands alone singing 'Killing Me Softly' in front of his school bullies but feel that upswing of joy when Grant joins him on stage with guitar.

226,irish_psycho,Hugh Grants best film to date,8,18 November 2004,"When I heard what this film was about first it didn't seem that appealing to me as a comedy. A bachelor in his 30's living in London, England. Who spends his days enjoying himself and deciding the next party he should attend and with who. His life is then interrupted by an unwelcome 12 year old boy Marcus who wants to be his friend and this is where the story matures. Least to say I was pleasantly surprised after seeing this film only disappointed by the fact I didn't get to see it in the cinema with the addition of the crowd's laughter. Hugh Grant plays Will the irresponsible big kid in the movie that is most likely the envy of most men out there. With this character I think this is where Grant shines as an actor in the perfect part for him, a dry witted bachelor who is afraid of commitment but still gets to go out with nice ladies and have lots of cool big boy's toys in his spacious well equipped apartment. Think American Psycho without the killings.There is one feature in the film that I particularly do not like which made me realize, how important it is to choose the right 'Music' for a film. Most of the music in the film is done by 'Badly Drawn Boy' although not particularly bad when heard once but it is played throughout the whole film. It is suited to some scenes but there could have been a little variety.Even though the film does have strong themes about growing up and taking responsibility, it never gets too serious to take you out of a giddy mood.This is highly recommended for Hugh Grant fans and anyone who enjoyed 'Four weddings and a funeral'.8* out of 10",About a Boy

Hugh Grant is this film, he carries it on his shoulders and does so extremely successfully. He is simply a reservation as the remarkably self-assured Will. Whereas before his agent was prone to securing him typecast roles, with support billing for his fringe, here however he has cast off the shackles of playing endlessly nice and upper class characters and his performance is easily the best of his career. There is also a superb soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy.Recommended.",About a Boy
228,jaimesayre,a man's bridget jones!,9,24 May 2002,"This is an incredibly clever, witty little film, with Hugh Grant playing a role I've never seen him in.  I'm not a big Hugh Grant fan and I was convinced that this was probably the ideal role for him, a single guy doesn't want to commit, wanders around aimlessly looking for single mothers to shag, however, the usual gestures and expressions that Hugh is so fond of using in his acting, no matter what the character, weren't as noticeable, leaving me to wonder if he's allowed himself to act without his safety net. If this is the case, then well done.  At several points, I almost forgot that this was Hugh Grant, he allowed himself to look older, less charming, human, and it worked. But that's enough about him. The movie itself moved with a gentle pace, not so slow as to bore you and not so fast as to lose you, and I found myself entertained throughout. I've never read the book for which this movie is based, but perhaps I should, then maybe I'd understand the opposite sex a little better.  `A man is an island' is the theme throughout and it couldn't be more wrong.Nicholas Hoult as Marcus steals the show from Grant, in my book, as the strange son of Toni Collette, who worked marvels with the character she was given, but she's always been one of my favorites since Muriel's Wedding.

Unfortunately, their mixture of comedy and drama didn't settle well on the stomach.I felt as if I were watching two separate movies, a formulaic-but-amusing British comedy, and a disturbing drama of depression, suicide, and childhood angst.  I can only compliment the writers who could manage to blend these together at all, and cajole the audience into laughing five seconds after a very disturbing and traumatic scene.  But that very talent made the film very unsettling.The climax of the film was weak and a little unnerving, but it wasn't the plot that I found enjoyable.

Try as they might, the films directors could draw no more than the usual linear performance out of Sunset Boulevards favourite Englishman. And why should they even try? About a Boy will undoubtedly be a success. This is not a film that asks you any questions, nor is it a film that will move you. It's just a cheery, seamless extension of Notting Hill and Bridget Jones Diaries. If you like that sort of movie, then you'll love About a Boy. The script is just about witty and clever enough to suggest that Nick Hornby's book, on which the film is based, is worth reading, and there are one or two laughs along the way. Hornby must feel sold short, though, by the particularly low quality acting of Grant, Nicholas Hoult, (who plays the boy) and the rest of the cast. High Fidelity and Fever Pitch are far better adaptations of Hornby's work. Grant is the least well-placed actor to complain about being typecast (with the possible exception of Vinnie Jones) when he delivers the same persona in every film, regardless of his role or the plot.",About a Boy

Maybe not as shallow, but you never know.On the technical side, this movie was very well done. Hugh Grant can act, and can act very well. The kid who played Marcus was awesome. The supporting characters don't just come in when the story demands it, but they exist out of the frame too. You believe that these people have lives outside of what we see.I think what I liked best was that Will (Hugh Grant) isn't a charictiture of the 'shallow/loner' guy. His character changes subtly. Hugh Grant plays him very balanced. You know that there is something deeper that he just isn't showing us.Nicholas Hoult's work as Marcus is also very well done. He doesn't play Marcus as just a cute kid. He plays him as a real kid. I can see Nicholas actually being like this off set. One scene that sticks out in my mind is when he's sitting in class, thinking about the song 'Rainy days and Mondays' and starts to sing it out loud, oblivious to the fact that he's in class. I can't speak for everyone, but I for one know that I have done this. I connected with this character. I believe that Marcus is real, and his problems are real.See this film.

However, the movie quickly evolves into a good and well written film.Being a huge fan of Hugh Grant I of course was encouraged to check out this film. Hugh Grant delivers another classic humorous performance. He plays a selfish man who lives all by himself and does nothing for a living. They aren't kidding when they say nothing. After getting rich off of this father's one hit wonder song, Will (Grant) never had any inspiration to do work in life. He just searches around aimlessly for some type of romance. One day, he meets a lady who is a single parent. Will soon discovers that single mothers are great people to date. Not only are they good people, but also they are vulnerable. In a desperate attempt to find more single mothers, Will visits a single parents club. At this group he lies to many of these mothers by telling them he has a child. Eventually he gets a date with a women there who introduces him to her friends son named Marcus, a scrawny 12 year old boy. Marcus takes comfort in Will when his mother loses it, creating a bonding friendship between Will and Marcus.What's charming about this film is the fact that thirty something and a 12 year old are able to become such great friends. The whole thought of it sounds a bit crazy but thats what really helps to bring this film to life. Along with great writers as well as great performances from Hugh Grant and from NIcholas Hoult (Marcus) So overall I would recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a good heartwarming comedy.",About a Boy

This is a general rule, but as a relatively open-minded person, I decided to continue watching.  And after a while, I find myself smiling...then came the laughter...then, I had completely forgotten that I was only watching this movie because I was bored.The best description of this movie is that it is a ""nice"" movie.  A movie about a guy who wants for nothing in life, but due to his growing relationship with a boy who is having problems living with his suicidal single mother, Grant's character begins to want for a little more in his empty, lonely life.Ok, guys, watch the movie with the girlfriend if you like, but it is certainly worth watching.  I doubt anyone who watches it from start to finish could say that they truly disliked it.7/10 (A decent, honest, ""nice"" movie)",About a Boy

Although the main character is self centered, ""An Island"" as he puts it, his honesty about his own shallowness is great. It's worth watching over and over again to catch all the clever jokes and other lines in the movie that were missed the first time.  Not that the plot of the movie isn't clear, it's just so loaded with great and obviously well thought out detail that you not only MUST see it, but you MUST see it several times.One last thing worth mentioning about the movie is that the music in the movie is really good.

253,robmillrs,Great performances all round,10,10 June 2002,"`About a Boy' is simply the best movie I've seen in a very long time. It has a broad appeal, and will draw you in from the opening moment if you give it even the slightest of chances. I loved the book and was wary, like so many others, of how the adaptation would work. Well, they did a brilliant job, beginning with the casting of Hugh Grant.I'm not really a fan of Grant: sure he was entertaining in Four Weddings, but his stock, foppish English-upper-class act got stale very quickly. Clearly he allowed himself to be stereotyped too early in his career. Well it seems as though he's turned a corner with the role of Will in `About a Boy.' Gone (or at least muted) are the mannerisms that I used to find annoying. Here he uses his hands, eyes and facial expressions in more subtle ways, and to great effect. He also plays a much more realistic, flawed character  and believably so. From now on I think the name Hugh Grant will draw me to movies rather than put me off them.What can I say about Nicholas Hoult as Marcus except to echo what so many others have said  what an astoundingly convincing performance! He conveys very well the innocent honesty of a boy forced to grow up too fast in a world with which he isn't really in synch. He was aggravating when the plot called for it, tight-lipped at the right times, awkward in the best traditions of early adolescence, winning and off-putting like any youngster (or adult for that matter). He impressed me most in his interactions with his screen mother, in the scene where he explains to Will in a heartbreakingly matter-of-fact tone how he copes with his misfit existence, and in his encounter with Rachel's son Ali. In fact I don't think he puts a foot wrong in the whole movie. In my opinion Nicholas Hoult absolutely nailed the character.Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz do wonders with roles that are, admittedly, under-written. Let's face it, `About a Boy' is the Will (& Marcus) Show. That's just how Hornby wrote it. But both actresses give their characters as much depth as the movie's constraints allow. Collette's Fiona is perhaps an unlikely portrait of the average single mother suffering from mental illness, but she convinces us because she is so sincere  in a movie with so many laughs, you can't help feeling moved by her tears or her expressions of affection for her son. And Weisz, despite having an even smaller part, is no less convincing in her interactions with Hugh Grant's character.Add to the mix Augustus Prew's brief but extraordinary performance as Ali and the sweet and sour character of Ellie so ably performed by Nat Gastiain Tena, then you have perhaps the best ensemble cast in any movie made so far this year, and perhaps the best we're likely to see in all of 2002!",About a Boy
254,kaiz,not as good as it could/should have been,7,20 February 2003,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. Nick Hornby´s book was absolutely fantastic, and the other movie based on his book ""High Fidelity"", starring John Cusack, was great,unfortunately this movie isn´t as good. The ending of the book and the ending of the film are totally different and also a lot of Hornby´s somewhat dark and sharp humour has been ""smoothened"" which is really a shame. Still, the first half of the movie, which is more true to the book, is really good, and Hugh Grant is fantastic! He really saves the movie. I never thought of him as much of an actor before, but he is marvellous as ""Will"". Defenitly a movie worth watching but can´t give it more than 7/10 because probably only 50% of the books great potential has been used.",About a Boy

Combine that with Hugh Grant's performance in last year's Bridget Jones' Diary and expectations are going to be quite high. Well, quite simply it succeeds due to a very skillful adaptation and more than anything Grant's performance. The problems (I felt) with the book have been removed (the character of Ellie) and replaced with slightly new problems (again, just my opinion). All the performances are top-notch and the Weitz brothers have done an excellent job (both co-adapting and directing). Nice to see that the London setting of the book is kept and also fun to see an Arsenal football club pendant in one of the character's room - Hornby's favourite football team that he wrote about with such infectious passion in Fever Pitch.Minor quibbles aside - well worth watching.",About a Boy

His acting showed a fine depth of talent which should hold him well if he is going to follow acting as a career. His portrayal of Marcus is excellent so that the character in the book comes across on screen as one would imagine. Well done Nicholas and obviously a tribute must go to the Directors and Hugh Grant for enhancing and developing his incipient talent. All in all a must see film and an assured enjoyable outing.

The great irony about 'About a boy' is that owning up to liking Hugh Grant is as about as cool as the Sahara, yet here he plays the very cool Will and pulls it off effortlessly. At first we see him as an arogant b****rd - albeit a very funny arogant b****rd. And then Marcus, the boy of the title, and the total opposite to Will - Very uncool, unpopular, yet original, invades Will's life and actually manages to give Will's life some meaning, whilst Will in his own way gives Marcus the confidence to face up to his own problems. The performances are great, the humour very funny, and for once the moving scenes are moving yet not overly done (Billy Elliot, another British comedy, p***ed me off with the way it seemed to try so hard to make us blub), and is a thoroughly enjoyable way of spending an hour and a half. Really there is good drama, a few scenes that will genuinly have you clutching your sides, and though you'll know from the beginning that the plot will tie up nicely for everyone at the end, this will still give you a warm heart and a goofy grin slapped all over your face long after the credits roll - go cheer yourself up and see this movie.",About a Boy

Collette is a bit of an odd one, can truly make herself look different, she was a great choice for the mother and Rachel Weisz, for someone who's seen her only in the Mummy movies, was refreshing.

This comes straight from the same mould as Four Weddings and Notting Hill.The same trendy London locations. The same trendy single-man-trendy flat. The same bungling Grant. Even the relationships work out the same. The trendies end up together and the misfits end up together and they all live happily ever after.Don't take this film seriously and you'll probably enjoy it - I did. It's light hearted fun.

When I heard that Hugh Grant was going to play the part of Will Freeman, I became increasingly wary, frightened he would turn the character into another Notting Hill blubbering fool who can't really spit out his words.  So the movie finally came out.  I went and saw it.  My predictions were entirely wrong.  About a Boy blew me away.  It was beautifully put together; each frame was perfect.  Hugh Grant did a marvelous job, as did the rest of the cast.  Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack is my new favorite album.  Although the book and the movie are different at parts, I feel that they altered the storyline so that it would be more plausible as a movie, which in my opinion is fine -- as long as Nick Hornby had a say in what was changed, which I'm sure he did.  About a Boy was so good that I wish I could relive the experience of seeing it for the first time over and over again. Go see this movie.",About a Boy
268,yoyoling,Surprisingly good for the directors of American Pie...,8,16 May 2002,"""About a Boy"" was a fine film with a solid blend of good acting and fun laughs/moments.  As has been commented by several film critics already, it marks yet another step in Hugh Grant's evolution from ""charming fop"" roles that he so popularized in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill."" Of course,  now we may have to be concerned with his being typecast as the jerky Englishman...along with Toni Collette being typecast as the lonely single mom.Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) gave a very good performance in his first major film role.  His acting was believable and not at all ""trained.""  Still, what I'm surprised at most of all is that the Weitz brothers (of ""American Pie"" and ""Here on Earth"" fame/infamy) directed this film.  The film was really quite excellently directed and a real testament to the fact that they can direct adult flicks with maturity *and* freshness.

It has something for everyone...exploring what makes the most cynical of men tick...and at the same time touching on how parents sometimes unwittingly put their own needs and preferences ahead of their children's. The film is superbly well acted all around - fine cast.  Toni Collette does a lovely job as Will's mother - providing humorous moments, as well as some very real ones.  The biggest standouts here obviously though are Hugh Grant as ""Will"" in an absolutely winning performance - one that I'm sure many will feel displays an unusual degree of depth for him...and Nicholas Hoult as ""Marcus.""  This child was amazing!  You will truly share in the ups and downs of this child's life...and cheer him on as he works to better his situation, and his mother's.  As for Hugh Grant - he succeeds in making a character with no apparent redeeming qualities absolutely likeable.  The soundtrack by Badly Drawn Boy is also a real winner!

Through one of his attempts, he meets Marcus (played excellently by Nicholas Hoult), who struggles with bullies and has to take care of his suicidal mother.I found the film to be very funny and poignant, keeping a good balance between comedy and drama. The acting is very underrated with flawless performances by Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, and Toni Collette.

Seriously. Seeing as I had absolutely no time to see the film on its original theatrical release, I rented it on DVD and boy oh boy did I kick myself afterwards, for I have missed the communal laughter and warmth that seeing this film with a cinematic audience would have brought me.There must be so many other reviews here at IMDB that I will not bother detailing the plotline (slack!). However, the comedy of the transformation of, Will, the main character, from an insanely self-centered man-child to a man who is willing to give up all of his dignity for a child's happiness (won't give away anything here!) is surprisingly well directed by the directors of the original gross out teen comedy series ""American Pie"", the Weitz brothers. The directors must have crossed seas here because the film is delightfully funny in a subtle way (as British comedies are).
The acting is flawless. Led by Hugh Grant (Will), whom some comment is the modern Cary Grant (well, both of them being British and all), is a champion player of the romantic comedy. His delivery is subtle, classy and he looks extremely natural; New comer Nicholas Hoult gives a sincere and honest performance as the young boy Marcus; Toni Collette, whom doesn't seem to ever give a bad performance, is touching as well as funny playing Marcus' suicidal mother Fiona; and Rachel Weisz cameos late in the film as Will's first real love, Rachel.Underscoring the film with effective, originally composed contempoary music that suits the moods of the movie well is the artist ""Badly Drawn Boy"".""About a Boy"" is a warm, honest, sincere, and genuninely laugh-out-loud film which will really make you think about how you live your life.10 points!",About a Boy

280,rohitthebest,About a Boy,7,10 October 2012,"Hugh Grant is one of my favorite actors; he is such a sweet guy (On-screen) that as many times I come across any new or old movie of him – I again and again fall in love with him. I believe he is one of the most underrated actors of his own times. Barring a very few of his movies – I have almost seen all more then once. This was one of those exceptionally brilliant feel good movies. In this movie, Hugh Grant is a well off guy surviving on his dad's royalties, having a good time doing nothing but watching TV. He dates a single mother but unfortunately their relationship ends amicably, soon comes up with an idea to date single mothers only by joining a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). What life throws on him is a hilarious ride and how it all ends is simply superb, it actually made me laugh out loud like crazy, totally loved his straight face comedy. The guy even when in so much trouble makes a damn good face and tries to walk out of trouble in his own ways. Watch out for the last scene and his performance on stage – you will be in splits for sure. It's a damn good one time watch especially for those who love clean comedies. Not to be missed.The Movie: As I mentioned earlier, Hugh is such a nice guy even in this movie that all his antics sound and look so genuine. His frustrations, confusions, reactions, even when he blurts out something in anger, it makes me laugh big time. Like it happens in this movie couple of times. The story is very simple and straight forward of a guy ""Will"" (Hugh Grant), who practically does nothing for a living as his dad composed some Christmas songs and the royalty coming from the same is more than enough for him to live a comfortable life. One fine day he meets a single mother but just in a couple of days he realizes they aren't meant to be together but since he is a nice guy and cares for her feelings – it's very hard for him to break off with her. To his shock, even she had the same feeling and they call it off amicably. But with this relationship he realizes one thing that its easy to be in a relationship with a single mother, have a good time and move on to the next, without any commitment or responsibility. During one of his grocery shopping trips he comes across an ad talking about a group called SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together), he joins them and claims that he has a two year old son whose currently gone with his separated wife. There he meets another parent and goes around with her. During one of their picnic trips, he meets her friend's 12 year old son Marcus (Nicholas Hoult). What happens in the picnic is hilarious stuff as Marcus kills a duck with a loaf of bread but Will saves him by creating a story, with which Marcus gets pretty impressed and develops a bond with him gradually.Marcus's mother too is a single parent and she tries committing suicide but somehow she is saved by Will and her neighboring friend who Will was dating previously. Marcus tries Will to date his mom to save her from loneliness but after their first date he follows Will and realizes that he neither has a kid nor is a divorcée. Marcus being a smart kid blackmails his way to his home and gets an access to Will's house as and when he wishes. They develop quite a good bond as they go out together and Will does helps him on couple of things, they do spend some good time together at Will's house. It was damn good to see Marcus's popularity starts growing in his school and he too ends up going around with a hot tom boyish girl Ellie (Natalia Tena), in the meantime Will too comes across Rachel (Rachel Weisz) and he uses Marcus as his own son to appear interesting to her. How they all meet and what goes around with Rachel's son and Marcus is hilarious, finally they end up breaking off as well and finally Will and Marcus too fight it off between themselves. What happens next and how it falls all over in right place is a classic ending. The last half an hour off the movie is too good with thinks going out of hands but again falling in right places. Marcus's social suicide even after his girl friends warning is too good and how Will saves him on stage is one hell of a scene.

I was sorry to see the movie end and would definitely recommend it. Hugh Grant was excellent and Nicholas Hoult (Marcus) did an amazing job.A movie about a man who is basically headed nowhere until he comes in contact with a young boy who changes his life. Sometimes predictable but each scene was done with just the right amount of humor and compassion.Some scenes were hilarious, such as when Grant's character joins SPAT just to meet women.Go watch it, if you like Hugh Grant comedies like 2 Weeks Notice, and Music and Lyrics, this one is even better.",About a Boy

287,chris_polymerica,A truly entertaining and worthwhile movie,8,1 November 2005,"I was skeptical of this movie having read the book some years ago. Firstly I had seen High Fidelity the movie based on another of Hornby's books and was very disappointed. Secondly I had a mild allergy to Hugh Grant who previously had seemed only capable of playing the same helpless, foppish character in every movie. The kind of character that women allegedly find adoring on screen, but if you were ever to act that way in reality they would beat you senseless with a frying pan after an hour.Imagine my surprise then when I was treated to this absolutely stunning movie. Hugh Grant finally proved that he can act and does a stunning job in a new type of character. Likewise the ""boy"" is excellent as are all other actors. This movie is totally engrossing and hugely entertaining while still tackling difficult subjects like growing up and trying to fit in at school while you have problems at home. It combines serious issues but also some very amusing scenes as well. The pacing is perfect and the music compliments the atmosphere admirably.There is no other movie that I have ever watched as many times as I have this one. Every time I enjoy it and marvel at it. I am totally unable to criticise it as the whole thing meshes to a very, very satisfying piece of work. Certainly one of my favorites, up there in the company of 12 Angry Men, The Usual Suspects and other excellent movies.",About a Boy
288,akhilaupendra-98324,Saved by the last scene,5,13 August 2019,"The last scene saved the movie to be eligible for a 7.1 on the IMDB. I mean, you could have taken more out of little Nicholas Hoult. He clearly has potential to do more in that character. He does not have to talk out loud, a mere 'look down face' could or would have passed a great deal of emotion to the crowd watching the movie.You could have shown a great depth of character from little Nicholous. I mean, his eyes show a great depth of his soul, don't they? Boy, his mother attempts suicide and he's not nearly mad about that? I could have been stoned by grief if I had experienced that. You could have shown more deep thoughts from Nicholous, Director.. I hope you could hear me.The last scene of the movie suggests that a family should not be left all alone by itself. It needs its' 'backup' to float in the water, when in crises. That's a good thing, and I believe that a family needs its backup, all the time. We are not solitary units. Everything is interconnected and I think those interconnections SHOULD BE BASED ON MUTUAL AUTHENTICITY.And, I don't know, I think Hugh should have not been casted in this movie. Maybe he manages alright in portraying a careless person, who throughout the movie, clearly shows that the character has not got a conscience. He refers to him as a 'man of island'. But, clearly, how can the other characters not notice that before falling prey to him?The movie could have had a great effect, if the shallow, irresponsible character of the protagonist (Hugh Grant depicting the character 'Will Freeman') is clearly understood by the other characters, either after falling prey to him or before that, and then directly attacked by those other characters. I think Hugh Grant is not showing his full potential in this movie; the director hasn't touched that part from Hugh Grant. Director,you could have shown the inner conflicts in 'Will Freeman's character; you could have made Will Freeman 'see through himself', through these inner conflicts and then I think this movie would have scored easily an 8 or at least 7.8. But I now think the novel didn't have such an insight for the character 'Will Freeman' in the first place, in order for the director to bring that depth of character in 'Will Freeman'.I might read the novel though, just out of curiosity.",About a Boy
289,adamkemp,Who knew the Weitz brothers could make such a smart and often hilarious movie?,8,15 May 2002,"How cool is Will Freeman?""This cool,"" British author Nick Hornby tells us a few pages into his 1998 best-seller About a Boy, the film version of which stars Hugh Grant: ""He had slept with a woman he didn't know very well in the last three months. He had spent more than three hundred pounds on a jacket."" And, to name just one more of Will's vainglorious achievements, ""He had spent more than twenty pounds on a haircut.""In other words, Will Freeman is the kind of guy that most men aspire to be, and most women aspire to be with - whether either sex will admit it or not.After watching Chris and Paul Weitz's adaptation of About a Boy, I'm still not sure what surprised me more: That Grant, who has made his career playing the lovable romantic bumbler (Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral), could be so perfect as the shallow cad described above. Or, that the Weitz brothers, who previously directed American Pie and the dreadful Chris Rock vehicle Down to Earth, were capable of making such a smart and often hilarious romantic comedy.Set in its original London (unlike the last Hornby adaptation, High Fidelity, which was transplanted to Chicago), About a Boy shows how Will's carefree life - comprised of countless hours playing pool, having his hair ""carefully disheveled"" at expensive salons, eating at posh restaurants, and having meaningless sex with as many women as possible - becomes complicated when he reluctantly befriends a troubled 12-year-old boy named Marcus (Nicholas Hoult).Is Will going to evolve? Is Marcus's friendship going to teach Will the valuable life lesson that, despite his claims to the contrary, no man is an island? You've probably seen enough movies to know the answers to these questions.But what makes About a Boy so refreshing is that the Weitz brothers, along with co-screenwriter Peter Hedges, effectively draw out the sentimental aspects of the story without overwhelming Hornby's acerbic brand of humor. (When Will goes to a meeting for single parents as a scam to pick-up ""grateful"" women, one woman boasts a T-shirt that says ""Lorena Bobbitt for Surgeon General."")Even Will's voice-over narration, a device commonly (mis)used by filmmakers to provide introspection, is mostly filled with sarcastic observations that consistently undermine whatever ""profound"" changes Will is experiencing.Grant does his part to shrink the sappiness by abandoning his trademark blinking and stuttering.  Rather than try to endear himself to everyone he meets, as typical in a romantic comedy, Grant seems to revel in Will's isolated, aloof existence. He gave a similar performance as the womanizing Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary, but with less charm and wit. Whereas Daniel was never trustworthy, Will parades his flaws so proudly that it's impossible not to cheer him on.The film also features strong performances by Hoult and Toni Collette as Marcus's depressed mom. Collette could be called the female Billy Bob Thornton thanks to her chameleon-like ability to portray totally disparate characters. In the recent drama Changing Lanes she was an attractive yuppie having an affair with the ethically-challenged Ben Affleck.  Here she convincingly plays a frumpy, eccentric single mom who is so depressed that she can't even make a bowl of cereal without crying.Of course, what most people who are reading this review probably want to know is if About a Boy is a better movie than High Fidelity. It isn't. But then, High Fidelity was a better book to begin with. Most Hornby fans I meet seem to agree.For those of you who may not already be Hornby fans, seeing About a Boy is an ideal place to start.",About a Boy

It has a few archetypal characters to provide laughs a la Jack Black in High Fidelity, but the two leads are fully developed characters. Will, who is funny enough to make you love him right off the bat to begin with, evolves into a person the audience can connect with. Although, of course, we shake our heads at much of what he is doing, we still find a a piece of him within us all, which is the real joy of the film.",About a Boy

It was quite heavy in narration, which is usually a bad sign, but it was done masterfully.

Very good to see a film where there are no AK47's stuttering, no foul language (well, only a couple of times) and no screaming and shouting and overacting to hype up the viewers. Marcus, the boy, was believable and worked well with Grant. The Brits still, in my opinion, make the most watchable films. They are truer to life. The women were attractive and did not look as though a plastic surgeon had tried to change them into some display dummy. Any age group could watch this and enjoy it. There is no sex for the voyeurs, and no violence for the sadists. (What a pity for them.)

293,juliette144,A very modern morality tale,9,16 June 2002,This is one great movie!!  After I had seen it a friend who had yet to see it asked whether Hugh Grant gets Rachel Weisz in the end.  I wouldn't tell him because that was entirely besides the point.  What the story was about was how we all need to relate to others.  And here we have a guy who appears to have everything but in reality has nothing befriending a young boy who appears to have nothing and yet really knows what life is about.  Who learns the most from whom is the point of this great modern day morality tale.For true classic comedy scenes I can't think of anything that beats Hugh Grant rushing to his young friend's assistance when he is about to humiliate himself by singing Killing Me Softly at the school rock concert.

It not only manages to combine humour with a terrific storyline but also brings great performances from all the talent involved. I was lucky enough to go to the premiere in Leicester Square, and afterwards met some of the stars. This film is highly appropriate for any fan of Bridget Jones, Four Weddings and Notting Hill. The film unlike many comedies is not a series of set pieces and works as a good plotline in its own right, without the comedy value. Nick Hoult is tremendous in the role of Marcus the son of a modern hippy who forces her son to adopt her worldly ideals (and clothing). Hugh Grant is just his average self, neverending tense moments, huge amounts of lies to women, just continuous humour throughout the film. He is an institution! Performances from Toni Collette with abundant amusement surrounding her throughout, and Rachel Weisz both create great support efforts. Overall this film sticks together and does not have loose scenes but is a thoroughly adorable film.",About a Boy

Perhaps there are not many of us here in the real world who can identify with the circumstances of Will's life (filthy rich, person of leisure...), but I believe that there are quite a good number of us who would prefer to hide safely within a wall of our own making and choosing. Human relationships are among the most difficult things that we engage in on this planet, after all, and if Will has found a way to avoid them at all cost, who can blame him? But, life has a strange way of finding us where we need to be, and along comes this poor kid who just needs a friend, and he chooses Will, and both are changed forever. One of my favorite scenes from not only this movie but from any one I've ever seen is when Will gets up onstage with Marcus.

But when Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) comes into his life through a bizarre twist of lies Will made up to get into a single parent's group, he is suddenly expected to become an adult, and help Marcus act like he used to - a kid.Adapted from the equally, if not more impressive, bestselling novel by Nick Hornby,  About A Boy is a hugely enjoyable film.  Though by no means perfect, it is full of quick gags and wit that will liven up your night.

Most often, people fall in love hastily without the believability associated with the development of the characters.  Furthermore, many screenplays are dreadfully trite with common one-liners that could be used in a variety of other romances.This, however, is not the case with About a Boy.  Intelligently casted, Hugh Grant is the highlight of the movie, portraying a playboy with poised and confidence, while being a scholar of the apprehensions of committing to a substantial relationship from the insights of the young, remarkable, and precocious Nicholas Hoult in this wonderful coming of age story.  The script is well written and suited best for Grant, who is should be worthy of an Oscar nomination, while the supporting ensemble of Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz make the acting quite enjoyable.  The movie is highly entertaining and beautifully made, with the subtle and clever usage of comedy by directors Paul and Chris Weitz, which captivates and engages the audience, making this film a great feel good movie and one of the best movies of 2002.",About a Boy

Particular in a way that some might find it well written and interesting but also oppositely. The movie had a cliché ending, in a sense that it could be foretold very easily. People who you expect end up together and people who had problems solved them. Even the main character Will was a typical movie hotshot. He did however have a little more depth which improved the story line and overall insight of the movie. Marcus' mother had typical problems, and Marcus himself was the typical school outcast. Other things such as the typical music and lines make the film look like a chick-flick. Although I could not consider this a film ""masterpiece"" it was definitely very entertaining. It was very comical and had a interesting situations. One of the best aspects of this movie was probably the thought behind the story line, or the part of the movie that goes deeper than the plot. The relationships you learn between people and how it affects their lives, and how people get insights of face problems and deal with them. The film can also be very relatable, and we can apply the lessons we learn from the film to our own life.

In the left corner, weighing in at about a quarter of pound, About a Boy the film. Let the fight begin!"" Let's begin this fight with a comparison between the book and the film and name the differences between those two. Firstly, we have the book which is written by Nick Hornby who we know from his other novels like High Fidelity. The book version of About a Boy is a nice written novel which is really nice and fast to read. The writing style of Hornby is very modern, into the face with nice descriptions of everything what's going on. The story isn't very exciting so it isn't a book you want to finish in one day, but it's certainly a book which is fun to read a couple of pages of before sleeping.The film is of course a lot shorter than the book so a lot of descriptions are a lot shorter than you will find in the book and there are also a lot less of them. But for the lazy people, the film will be more amusing than the book will. I'm one of those people who would prefer to watch the film, just because I prefer to watch to a story than to read a story.So decide for yourself what you prefer or maybe you want to read the book and watch the film but then I prefer to watch the film first, it helps a lot to visualize the scenes when your reading the book!",About a Boy

I read the book in about 3 or 4 days, which is reasonable fast. I've to admit the it didn't read that fast because the story was so interesting to me ,but just because it was easy to read and not unpredictable. However, my expectations before seeing the movie were quit high. Some things I didn't liked about the story, was that there were very few serious events during the book, which made I quit hard to read. Also i didn't like the difference between the story line of the book compared to the story line of the film, because at the ending of the film the film takes a different turn.

So it make it difficult to read, because you can represent them. I won't say that it's a bad book, but there are disadvantages. So that's about the book. The film is good, because there are subjects that are realistic. For example the mother of Marcus Fiona tries to commit suicide and Marcus is bullied on school. That subjects are realistic, because they often happen in real. But the book is realistic, too. In the film they don't talk too much about one subject. They talk enough about one subject, but not too much. So my conclusion is that the novel is good, but film is better and that is because the film don't talk too much about one subject and the novel does. I think everyone must see this film and read the book",About a Boy
322,isabelsteenbergen,About A Boy,7,18 April 2011,"I've watched the movie and I've read the book, and there are a lot of differences between those two. For example, in the movie there is sort of a rock concert going on in Marcus's school, but in the book there is nothing what refers to a rock concert or something like that. Also a difference is that Nirvana is playing a big role in the book, but in the film there is no Nirvana at all, which a think is a pity. The biggest difference is the end I guess. The end in the book is totally different from the end of the film. The end of the film is a happy end, eventually everything is fine. Marcus is happy and has friends, Will has a relationship with Rachel and Marcus's mum seems to fall in love with a weird friend of Will. In the book the end is totally different. In the movie they also skip a whole part, the part where Marcus and Ellie go to Cambridge to visit Marcus's dad. I both like the film and the book, but if I have to make I choice, I like the book better because everything is comprehensively explained.",About a Boy

I liked the way of playing. The book was a bit strange. I don't have a fantasy to create my own vision of the story. With a film I can. The film is more funny and the book is a lot of serious stuff. In the book there were parts that didn't exists in the film. Like the Christmas evening. When Marcus got a CD and a CD-player when in the book he only got a CD. I don't understand why this small thing is different in the book but it is. Also the characters of the film are chosen good. They played their role better than the characters in the book. Marcus was the smart little guy, Will was the enthusiastic, a bit strange and friendly person and Fiona the desperate mother who was always crying. I liked the film very much. But the book wasn't interesting.",About a Boy

I didn't like it that much, because it rushed through things so fast I couldn't understand some things the first time. In the novel Nirvana and Kurt Cobain play a pretty big role and in the film it barely gets mentioned. The ending is also different and the performance of Marcus, which is I think the most important part of the movie, doesn't even exist in the novel. The characters in the movie are well acted and sometimes funny. I think the novel is better than the movie, because it goes more into detail and explains things a lot better.

Will is a lonely 38-year old man, living of the money of his father and actually doing nothing all day long. And then there is Marcus, a 12-year old boy with a crazy mother, who gets bullied and has not a very nice life. When they meet, Will is irritated on Marcus. But when Marcus keeps on visiting him every day, uninvited, Will starts to care about him. They try to help each other with their problems. About a Boy is a very intriguing story and you completely get sucked into it. You just want to know how Will and Marcus will end up. Will they ever be happy? I recommend the film (and the book) to everyone. I am sure that not only females will like this, but also guys will find this film very nice. It is for every age and everyone who watches it, will want to watch it again. Really, you should see it!",About a Boy
326,thomas_vitessefan,Comparison to the book,7,20 April 2011,"I think that the movie About a Boy is a good movie with a few very good actors. I think that Hugh Grant plays the role of 'Will' very well, I even think that Hugh was/is the ideal actor for this role and that there was/is no one else that could play this role better than him. I also think that the movie has worked out better than the novel. This because I found the end of the movie a lot better than the ending of the novel. In the novel Marcus has to go to his dad to live in Cambridge. In the movie they all celebrate Christmas together (Will, Marcus, Ellie, Fiona, Rachel and Ali). The movie has a open, but at least a happy ending, the book also has an open ending, but it doesn't have a happy ending at all. Another thing that disappointed me was that in the movie there is no music from Kurt Cobain or Snoop Dogg. In the book this music plays a pretty big role in the development of the characters, but in the movie all of this music was gone. Something I liked about the book and about the movie is that in both you get sucked in the story and it only lets you go when it's finished. This makes the story very easy to read/watch.All in all I liked the movie better than the book!Thomas",About a Boy

In the movie Marcus and Will are competing in some sort of talent show. While in the novel, Marcus and Ellie are going to see his dad, who felt off a window edge. They get arrested, because Ellie threw her shoe through the window of a record shop. If I HAD to choose between the novel and the movie, i would rather choose the movie. Although the I liked the ending of the novel more, the story of the movie was clearer to me, than the novel was. With the novel it was sometimes hard to understand what they were talking about.

328,nielsbanierink,A good filming of the novel,8,20 April 2011,"I think the film about a boy is a very good example of a filming, which is interesting, even if you have already read the book. In the main story it's the same, but the film had some happenings which the book did not have, so it wasn't exactly the same. The only thing I think it had to be mentioned in the film is the music of Curt Cobain and Snoop Dogg, because in the book it played a pretty big part, but in the film it was almost nothing. An other positive thing of the film was that the actors been chosen were very good. Especially Hugh Grant played the role of Will very well. What I most like about a filming is that you can see what a writer means with the characters, in a book you have to imagine what kind of people they are. I know some people think that's just the reason why a book is more fun, but if I have to imagine a whole story, it looks almost the same as other stories because I every time think about the same landscape with it. So I think the film is better than the novel.",About a Boy
329,kikiverwijmeren,About a boy - the book or the movie?,8,20 April 2011,"About a boy goes about Will, an cool, modern and hip adult and about Marcus, a little, friendless, weird child. In the beginning of the book you get to know them very well and finally they get to know each other and they help each other to grow up.The beginning of the movie and the book are quiet the same, but at the end you will see a lot of differences. Par example Marcus wears glasses in the book, but he didn't in the movie. Also his behavior changes much in the book, but in the movie it isn't that much changed. The biggest difference is the end. In the book Marcus first is a witness of an accident, with Ellie who broke the window, than he went to his father and at the end Will makes sure he's alright. Ellie has a bigger role in the book than in the movie. In the movie Marcus did a performance at school in front of everybody, because of his mother, Will wanted to stop him, what didn't work and finally Will ends on stage with a guitar in his hands. The movie ends with Christmas, where they are all together as one family.I liked the book better than the movie, because the book is more in detail and you are the person who can use your fantasy.

Of course there are film better than this one, but i don't want to talk about that. What I want to do is comparing the film and the book. The film fits good to the book. Many aspects from the book are processed in the film. If you've read the book, you see comparisons. The book is more extensive but you can imagine a picture for your own, the film on the other hand doesn't explain much besides the theme of the story. So i would recommend the book if I have to choose. But the fact remains, the film is also very good, if you only see the film you also have a complete picture of the story.",About a Boy

I liked the film. I've seen it a couple of times before and it doesn't annoy me. The film has also a good story in it. It's just like the book, but shorter. The acting was good and I really liked the part with Marcus stolen sneakers. I think it's a pity that the part with Will in a baby store is cut out the film. This was hilarious. I think the actors were good in their role. Marcus and Fiona came really good over like they were hippies. They are really alternative. And in some situations Will looks like he really doesn't know what he has to do. Now I have to say I really like the acting of Hugh Grant. I think he is a really good actor.

The book is probably too long to fit into regular 90- something minutes and it's to be guessed that rights to use Nirvana were not obtainable or too expensive.But even with all that in mind, this movie loses the point. There is a reason that Curt Cobain and Nirvana play a huge role in the story. As well as Ellie's and Marcus' relationship and them getting arrested.

It's a film that draws you in with its humorous but sobering, authentic and honest look at life, love, single-hood, relationships, and family. Grant does a brilliant job at making you love, despise and sympathize with him as he attempts to find love by faking to be a father in an effort to win over a girl. He learns more than he signed up for as he learns what life and love is truly about. I think every guy should watch this film as it encapsulates what our approach to life can so often turn into and hopefully will cause many to stop and think, is this really what my POV of life should be.

341,HollyBuck,Review,9,14 July 2014,"About a Boy is a heart-warming comedy film starring Hugh Grant and introducing Nicholas Hoult. The film tells a tale of the unlikely connection between a 30something man who's got it all, without ever having done a hard days work in his life, and thinks of himself as an 'island' and a peculiar 12 year old boy who struggles at the mercy of bullies and his depressed mother. Whilst this may seem like an unlikely duo, Grant and Hoult manage to pull it off perfectly. The film is well scripted, making sure that it delivers comedy and seriousness at a good level without one over-balancing the other and without ruining the book written by Nick Hornby of which this film was based off of. As well as top performances from Hugh Grant, Nicholas Hoult, Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz, the film also contains excellent music performed by Badly Drawn Boy. The music used in the film further enhances the scenes and emotions that are being conveyed. The main message in the film, is to further prove a famous quote from Jon Bon Jovi stating that ""No man is an island."". We learn from watching the characters themselves, especially Will, how true this quote is and the importance of having others in your life. I've seen this film countless times and each and every time I find that I'm smiling at the end. While it may not be perfect, it's certainly one of Hugh Grant's best performance and provides a heart-warming message.",About a Boy

Hi fidelity was a brilliant Nick Hornby but mind you they had actors who can do more than 2d acting. Toni Collette comes out unscathed but thats about it. Granted it is a more modern interpretation of a nineties setting but i think it was a little machinelike. The soundtrack is the only outstanding mention.

We are able feel Will's progress from a completely hopeless eternal child, to the man who finally decided to participate in the life around him. Markus is a compelling portrait of all of us at some point in life, when we were so lost that, not only we did not have the answers, but we were not even aware of the issues.

345,fluffybunnies88,About a timeless movie!!!(May Contain Spoilers),10,29 October 2011,"Whilst doing a little bit of tidying I came across the DVD and I watched it, remembering how much I had loved it when I first saw it at around the same age as Marcus. It's interesting but that feeling hasn't changed at all.The film is about a vain, shallow, selfish man in his late 30's called will finding friendship with a shy, awkward and endearing 12 year old boy called Marcus. Together in their friendship they help each other find solutions to each others problems. And although it may sound cheesy to most, it really isn't. The movie is a timelessly heartwarming, feel good movie but it is also very funny. Some scenes will make you laugh endlessly.Will is a character who needs to learn to grow up fast. He's never had a job, has no girlfriend and he spends his days buying things. Hugh Grant was the perfect choice for the character. He has this ability of making a character who may come across unlikeable and making him likable. He is very funny in this; his character has some of the funniest quotes in the movie. It's impossible to hate him, he is charming and you can relate to his character.Although i like will and Hugh in the film, Marcus and Nicholas stood out for me throughout the whole film. Marcus is a kid who has too much to deal with in his life, but deals with it with maturity beyond his years. He has no friends, is bullied at school and goes home to a depressed single mum although he is a kind, sensitive and a little awkward he is without a doubt lovable. Nicholas Hoult is absolutely astounding. There's a scene near the end where you feel his nerves. It's a scene where Marcus sings at a school concert despite hating standing up in front of people, because he wants to make his mum feel better by singing her favourite song ""killing me softly"". As Marcus stands alone performing to the heckling crowd of his peers he shows so much vulnerability and bravery. And Nicholas Hoult conveys this feeling, he makes you connect with Marcus and you forget you are watching a movie because you want to go up and protect him from the crowd because the emotions and the characters are so realistic to you. This performance shows just why Nicholas Hoult is one of if not the best upcoming actors of his generation. I cant wait to see his future movies, he is a natural.The supporting cast is brilliant also. They all play their parts wonderfully. The directors did a marvellous job at making this film. I hadn't really seen any of their work, but I want to see more of their work now.And I cannot leave this review without mentioning the amazing soundtrack. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing by Badly Drawn Boy. The songs are all poignant to what is on screen and the songs are wonderful.If you haven't seen this film, or loved it and want to watch it again, then I urge you to go and watch it. It is an amazing film that will make you laugh and at times cry. And its amazing that i still feel this way even 10 years on from seeing it originally.Absolutely Timeless.10/10 for me.",About a Boy
346,steven-mcmahon,Perfect- My Favourite Film!,10,24 March 2006,"Not entirely faithful to Nick Hornby's great book, but is a huge improvement on its messy ending and perfectly judges and re-creates the book's theme of friendship in a funny and deeply moving way. The film manages to deal with suicide and relationships of all kinds in a believable and honest way. The film focuses on the relationship developed between immature and selfish thirty-something Will and mature and naive twelve year old Marcus. Hugh Grant excels in his finest role as Will and brings humour and emotion to his emotionally immature character. Nicholas Hoult is impressive as Marcus, carrying almost the entire emotional weight of the film with ease. Toni Collette and Rachel Weisz provide excellent supporting turns but are slightly overshadowed by Grant and Hoult. The film features intelligent and sensitive direction from Chris and Paul Weitz that brilliantly captures both humour and emotion without being maudlin or ruining the book's very British identity. Badly Drawn Boy's soundtrack is sensitive, compelling and never intrusive, simply adding power and emotion to the actor's performances.
