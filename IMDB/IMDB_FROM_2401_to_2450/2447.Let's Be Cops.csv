0,SnoopyStyle,some dumb comedy from funny duo,6,20 May 2015,"Ryan (Jake Johnson) and Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) are best friends and roommates. They are 30, struggling in L.A. and on the verge of going back to Ohio. Ryan is the former star quarterback who never made it to the pros. Justin wants to be a video game designer but can't sell his Patrolman game. They dress up as cops for their college reunion. Then Ryan has an idea to ""Let's be cops"". They challenge gangsters endearing themselves with the locals like Josie (Nina Dobrev). They are befriended by beat cop Segars (Rob Riggle).It's odd that Jake Johnson is the former star quarterback. Damon might be able to pass for it. I do like the duo and their crazy stupid bromance. They are hilarious in those little scenes together. Stripping in club is funny. The problem is that they put the guys in a serious crime drama. That's not funny. This isn't 'Beverly Hills Cop'. The comedy is much broader so it can't do anything serious. It's a lot of silly idiocy. The point is that they really shouldn't be cops.",Let's Be Cops

They then continue to pretend to be real cops by learning police procedures via YouTube and buying police equipment on ebay. They hope to benefit from the perks of being real cops.Wayans an unsuccessful video game designer of a Grand Theft Auto variety but focusing on cops figures that the experience might help him with his game design.However they then get entangled with some Albanian crime gang and also crooked cops while all the time keep up the pretence.Johnson and Wayans make a good team but this is an unfunny script and a routine plot. There are a few chuckles but the film overstretched a one note joke.,Let's Be Cops
2,nogodnomasters,THIS IS MY COLLAR,4,25 November 2018,"Two guys from Ohio haven't made it in LA and plan on returning. Ryan (Jake Johnson) a former Purdue QB relives his glory days, but doesn't have a job. Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) is a video designer who has designed a cop patrol game. Our duo use the uniforms for a masquerade party and discover the perks of being policemen. Unfortunately they cross paths with a crime boss (James D'Arcy) leading to an improbable turn of events.I failed to find the humor in the film. This is apparently made for teens. The humor was lowbrow crotch in the face screaming man type of stuff. I was bored with a formulaic film that lacked any kind of clever writing or dialogue.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex.

3,kosmasp,Let's do it,7,14 June 2015,"Bromance at its best! And finally a comedy involving a Wayans that I can get behind with. It's been some time since I was able to write that. The movie is not intellectual nor is it surprising. It just does what it says on the box (read cover). And it's a lot of fun to watch the two friends (who have their issues and add some ""criminal"" activity to them during the movie).The movie is not politically correct at all and there are things that you can easily slander. But why take the fun out of it, why not enjoy this? It's obvious the crew and cast had a lot of fun making this and in this instance it translates on screen.",Let's Be Cops

They have been shaking down businesses to take them over so that they can launder money through them.There is romance and disagreement between our two friends along the way; they even fool real cops into thinking they're the real deal and soon team up to get the goods on this awful gang.Light fanfare and at least the police are depicted in a positive way.",Let's Be Cops
5,utgard14,Not Bad,5,2 November 2014,"Decent comedy about two loser friends who dress as cops for a costume party. Walking down the street, they are mistaken for the real thing. Liking the respect and attention they attract, they decide to keep up the charade. Naturally this gets them into real trouble. It's not a laugh riot but it is enjoyable. There are a few exceptionally funny parts. The two leads aren't the best but the people backing them up provide some laughs. The highlights include the scene with the running fat naked guy, the stakeout at the horny chick's apartment, and Keegan-Michael Key's character. It's nothing groundbreaking and I will likely never see it again. But it is worth watching at least once.",Let's Be Cops
6,zardoz-13,Routine Wannabe Cops Saga,4,23 August 2014,"Timing is everything, and ""Something Borrowed"" director Luke Greenfield's contrived law & order, buddy comedy ""Let's Be Cops"" couldn't have been released at a worst time with police violence dominating the headlines in Missouri. Whether Missouri lawmen will be exonerated in the highly publicized shooting death of a young, unarmed, African-America male, this obnoxious, uneven, buddy comedy about two civilians masquerading as cops amounts to crass, substandard schlock. Two losers struggling to make something of themselves in Los Angeles hit on the quaint idea of impersonating Los Angeles policemen. The only redeeming asset here is comedian Rob Riggle who steals every scene away from fellow comics Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr.Initially, everything is fun and games until our bogus boys in blue find themselves caught up in a war with murderous villains extorting foreign shop keepers. Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. are cast as a couple of mischievous, thirty-something roommates bound for a costume party. Ryan (Jake Johnson of ""21 Jump Street"") and Justin (Damon Wayans Jr. of ""The Other Guys"") can go dressed up either in sheets as spooks or put on police uniforms. Predictably, they choose to be cops, dress up in the blue uniforms, and hoof it around the sidewalks like the fuzz. Justin is a video game creator, while Jake is an injured college football player whose only claim to fame is an appearance in a herpes PSA. Eventually, after they run around as cops, Ryan takes their masquerade a step farther and acquires a police cruiser from E-Bay and convinces a reluctant Justin to ride with him. Mind you, everything that they know about the LAPD has been learned from the movies. Initially, they have harmless fun. They pick on a group of guys smoking a joint in public and smoke it with them. Naturally, these guys are surprised not only because the cops partake of their cannabis, but also because they don't arrest him. Later, our heroes struggle to settle a domestic dispute where girls are beating up on each other. Inevitably, the real cops pull them over afterward because Ryan hasn't gotten legitimate license tag for his black & white cruiser. Before the real cops can do anything to them, a call goes out about intruders in a closed supermarket. Our heroes accompany the real cops into the store to help them round up two thieves. As it turns out, one of the intruders is a grotesquely obese sumo wrestler. This mammoth individual tumbles atop Justin and rubs his genitals over Justin's face in a scene reminiscent of ""Borat."" Eventually, Justin, who designs video games, meets an attractive waitress, Josie (Nina Dobrev of ""Chloe""), at one of the diners and they are attracted to each other. Predictably, trouble crops up in paradise when a gang of slimy Russian mobsters set out to kill our heroes for interfering in their affairs. The authorities want cage fighting villain Mossi (James D'Arcy of ""Age of Heroes""), but nobody will testify. Our heroes find themselves entangled with the merciless Mossi as well a stocky patrolman named Segars (Bob Riggle of ""22 Jump Street""), but Segars is on their side. Meantime, they combine their talents to track down the dastards, and they stumble onto corrupt cops, too. Later, they infiltrate the storage quarters of these Russian mobsters and find firearms and automatic weapons. By this time, a high-ranking detective is on their trail. This detective is working with Mossi and his thugs. He knows that our heroes are legit. On the other hand, Ryan and Jake have managed to fool Segars so well that he unloads a cache of surveillance equipment so they can monitor the activities of Mossi and his minions. Gradually, Ryan grows more involved with his masquerade while Justin finds more time to develop his video game about two cops in the thick of action watching each other's back. Before it is all over, our fake heroes in blue are shooting it out with real thugs.Despite its glossy production values; ""Let's Be Cops"" qualifies as an appalling comedy. Jake Johnson wants to be another Bill Murray, but he lacks the essential charisma to pull it off. Instead, he comes off as an unsavory lout who exploits the police, while Damon Wayans Jr. emerges as a likable sort of fellow. Sadly, these two share little in the way of camaraderie. James D'Arcy succeeds far better as a villain, and Andy Garcia enjoys a scene or two as a suspicious character. Director Luke Greenfield keeps the action, often unconvincing, moving quickly enough, but our screwy heroes involve a youngster in their shenanigans that do feel right from the get-go. Let's hope that this movie doesn't develop a trend with amateurs posing as real cops. It's not as funny as it wants to be.",Let's Be Cops
7,view_and_review,Another Comedy Duo Attempt,5,25 January 2015,"From one Wayans to another. Last night I watched A Haunted House 2. After that horrible experience I decided to watch Let's Be Cops today. I'd seen Damon Wayans Jr. in Dance Flick and I thought he was hilarious. Well, it seems those are the only roles he can pull off.Let's Be Cops was moderately funny. I was expecting some more outlandish situations or just funnier situations. I don't think I even part way laughed until 20 minutes in.Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) was the straight character. He was also soft and girly. Ryan (Jake Johnson) was the twisted character. He was also a complete loser. I'd like to say they made a good tandem but they didn't. There was a lot of slapping, arguing and screwing up; stuff that can be seen in other movies that are funnier. They were very Three Stooges at times.The comedic duo has been done many times before and they did nothing to separate themselves from the pack. Honestly, Justin's whimpy straight act got old really quick as did Ryan's bumbling loose cannon act. What looked to be a comedy smash from the trailers was more like a comedy thud.",Let's Be Cops
8,george.schmidt,"Better-than-anticipated (barely) high concept, low-brow comedy",7,17 August 2014,"LET'S BE COPS (2014) **1/2 Jake Johnson, Damon Wayans, Jr., Rob Riggle, Nina Dobrev, James D'Arcy, Keegan-Michael Key, Andy Garcia, Natasha Leggero. Better-than-anticipated (barely) high concept, low-brow comedy about two losers buddies (NEW GIRL's co-stars Johnson and Wayans) who decide to pep up their crummy lives as policemen after a costume party snafu results in them getting respect and a new-found self-respect. While the laughs are frequent (which is astounding since I can barely tolerate the normally shrill Wayans and the disappointed to learn Key was in the film; he acquits himself as a hybrid Rasta/Hispanic informant) the film needs easily twenty-minutes shaved off as the premise goes on far too long no thanks to a predictable script by hack filmmaker Luke Greenfield and his collaborator in crime Nicholas Thomas. The duo's chemistry makes up for the dumb and dumber histrionics and some genuine bellylaughs no matter the cost of dignity. Bonus: jar-head Riggle does a great job as a real cop and stand-up vet Leggero gets her ya-yas out as an oversexed aide-de-camp.",Let's Be Cops
9,anaconda-40658,Post Police Academy.,6,3 September 2015,"Let's Be Cops (2014): Dir: Luke Greenfield / Cast: Jake Johnson, Damon Wayans Jr, Nina Dobrew, Rob Riggle, Andy Garcia: This is a comedy that extends our boundaries mentally into the realms that cross reality with fantasy. Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr play best friends struggling to fit in. During a costume party they decide to dress up as cops and are overwhelmed with responses where people actually took them for real cops. This gives Johnson an idea once he realizes the benefits of being taken seriously as cops. Suddenly women flock to them for stripper parties, plus they can get even with those guys that damaged their vehicle. Johnson buys a car off the Internet and purchases all the gadgets to make it resemble a real squad car. They get in too deep when a mob of criminals take a dislike to their actions. This is an amusing premise accompanying what amounts to a long sketch comedy. The climax boils down to a shootout with our heroes pretty much redeemed of their playing with matches charade. This is not nearly as funny as Police Academy or Reno 911: Miami, but it contains fired up performances from its leads. Johnson goes in too deep not realizing that real police work is no picnic. Wayans plays a struggling video game marketer caught up with his friend. Supporting roles are less exciting. Nina Dobrew as a waitress whom Wayans takes interest in is about as enticing as a dish rag. Rob Riggle plays a real cop but never as funny as in other films. Andy Garcia is the real disappointment playing a corrupt one note detective. Superb idea about reality and fantasy allows this cop comedy to pass inspection. Score: 6 / 10",Let's Be Cops
10,phd_travel,More funny than not,8,4 March 2015,As with the recent cop buddy movies you can expect crude jokes painful moments and some laughs. This one is above average because the funny moments outweigh the painful parts. Plus they are just pretending to be cops so it's different. There is an underdog feel good thing too and a fairly clever rounded story.The cast is likable and well chosen. Damon Wayans Jr and Jake Johnson aren't over familiar and they are quite watchable. Under different hands like Rogen or Wahlberg there roles might have come across as strained. Nina Dobrev looks quite lovely here as the romantic interest of Wayans' character. British actor James D'Arcy is quite unrecognizable as the villain.Worth one watch.,Let's Be Cops
11,zetes,"Some really funny moments, but maybe not enough",6,25 August 2014,"A low-brow, low-ambition comedy with only the shoddiest of plots. I went to laugh, though, and I did, at least a bit. I'm a huge fan of the sitcom New Girl, in which both Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. star. Four back-to-back episodes of New Girl (or Wayans' previous sitcom, Happy Endings) would blow this film out of the water laugh-wise. These kinds of films always feel the need to graft a cliché plot onto the amusing antics of its stars, and then they tend to get lost in that rote plot by the end. Let's Be Cops is quite funny when it's just the main characters joking around, play fighting or getting into slapsticky situations. In addition to Johnson and Wayans, Keegan-Michael Key and Natasha Leggero have really funny, small roles.",Let's Be Cops

13,DKosty123,Title is one word away,6,29 December 2014,Put your brain into fantasy mode and remember when you were a kid. This comedy should be called Let's Play Cops.and funny It is crazy and funny all at once. Any movie with the guts to start with an old Backstreet Boys song is a little warped at the start.Then there are lots of zingers and an overall good time. The stars get away with a lot of fun without annoying too many people. The criminals do get annoying and create some funny situations. Think this movie might have inspired the recent Night Crawlers though this one has an ending that makes much more sense. Put your hands up and laugh with this one.,Let's Be Cops
14,KineticSeoul,"Sure it's flawed, but I still kinda liked it",6,8 January 2015,"Now this is a comedy that shouldn't be taken too seriously, I mean it's a comedy. I could tell why the critics would bash on this movie, but in my personal opinion most of it actually worked. That doesn't mean every comedy gets a pass for it's sloppy writing. But this is a comedy that works, it isn't one of the funniest comedy I seen. But I did enjoy it and the direction despite it being far-fetched.It was at least somewhat fun to sit through. The plot is about two guys that goes around pretending to be cops. Now with the premise and the trailer, I thought this was going to be a super crude, offensive and over the top movie. However that just isn't the case, this is actually not that crude, has a bit of heart with two actually likable guys making few mistakes then and their but becoming increasingly likable as the movie progresses. Now the third act of this movie is super predictable with the most cliché and generic villain. Which I thought was the main flaw but overall it's actually a okay movie to sit through if you got nothing better to do. I mean I enjoyed this one more than ""22 Jump Street"" and as far as buddy cop movie goes or wannabe buddy cop movies go this is a decent one. I just don't see how their gonna come out with a sequel, which they likely do with these comedies. Since most of the humor comes from the duo pretending to be cops and doing dumb and yet somewhat harmless stuff. 6.8/10",Let's Be Cops
15,Hellmant,'22 JUMP STREET' is so much funnier.,5,20 August 2014,"'LET'S BE COPS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Buddy cop flick about two losers pretending to be cops, for their own amusement, who then become involved in solving actual crime in their community. It stars Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. as the two wannabe cops and costars Rob Riggle, James D'Arcy, Nina Dobrev, Keegan-Michael Key and Andy Garcia. It was directed by Luke Greenfield (who also directed the outstanding 'THE GIRL NEXT DOOR') and written by Greenfield and Nicholas Thomas. I found the film to be funny and amusing, in places, but definitely a lot more miss than hit.Best friends Ryan (Johnson) and Justin (Wayans Jr.) are down on their luck and turning 30. Ryan is an unemployed former high school football star and Justin is a bullied video game designer. After Justin's policemen game is mocked by his boss, Ryan comes up with the idea of wearing the police uniforms, from Justin's game presentation, to a college reunion party. They're rejected by their old classmates as well but upon leaving the party they realize people on the streets, who don't know them, think they're real cops. Ryan buys a used cop car and takes the prank to dangerously illegal extremes. Then they become the target of Russian mobsters and start stealing police equipment to expose the gangsters' crimes and bring them to justice.The movie has gotten horrible reviews from most critics (it's sitting at 12% positive on rottentomatoes.com) but still did huge box office it's opening week (over $26 million in it's first 5 days). For a low budget ($17 million) comedy flick, starring two mostly unknown TV stars, that's a pretty impressive debut. The movie's not that funny though. I laughed a few times but that was mainly just due to the effort put forward by the actors (and five of the leads mostly improvised all their dialogue). The directing is OK (a few action scenes, towards the end of the movie, are really well done) but the script is pretty bad. It's a funny idea for a film but it's not played out very well. I think it did really good at the box office because it capitalized a lot on the recent popularity of '22 JUMP STREET' (it's a pretty similar themed movie). '22 JUMP STREET' is so much funnier though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/QyJ3WU3eIos",Let's Be Cops
16,FeastMode,my notes,2,25 June 2019,"I hated it a lot. i wanted to leave before it was finished. it was almost 0 funny. neither of the main characters should be a lead in a comedy, or in anything for that matter. so many parts that were supposed to be funny were met with the sound of crickets. so many corny cheesy stupid parts. i just wanted it to end (1 view)",Let's Be Cops
17,Robert_duder,What did everyone expect? It was better than it has any right to be.,7,31 August 2014,"The moment I saw that trailer for this I knew exactly what to expect. I am honestly mind blown by the ""poor"" reviews for this film and people calling it crude and unfunny and stupid. Yep! This film reeks of crude and stupid (I won't say unfunny because I laughed.) I knew immediately this was going to be a brain dead stoner comedy and I actually expected I would hate it. I knew it would be filled with middle aged guys acting like teenagers, sex jokes, drug use and toilet humour and I'm not sure how you could expect anything more. Now all that being said the film actually has a decent plot and some action and its sort of cute with a little bit of heart and decent enough characters to make it entertaining. It isn't amazing at all but far better than I thought it would or better than it has any right to be. It has a buddy cop vibe, 48 Hours/Another 48 Hours, Beverly Hills Cop, Lethal Weapon-ish....and although not anywhere near as good as any of those films, it is decent for a modern day spin where brain dead comedy usually goes a long ways. The movie going public lacks a certain amount of brain cells and comedies tend to be dumbed down to appease them (yah I said it.) If you can turn your brain off and just prepare to be goofy then you'll have fun.I like Jake Johnson a lot from New Girl and from his role in Safety Not Guaranteed (an amazing indie comedy!) This is sort of his leap to mainstream big screen and he does well. He always sort of plays the same type of role but his character is fun and even has a little bit of depth and he definitely has charisma enough to carry the film. I do think he will find his break out role if this isn't it. Damon Wayans Jr. does what the Wayans brothers know best...silly comedy. Wayans is decent and has solid chemistry with Johnson (an integral part to a buddy film) and he has some genuinely funny moments and lines. I don't think he's quite as good as Johnson but the two of them together are solid. Rob Riggle is actually fantastic in a small but important supporting role as a real cop that they inadvertently end up working with. Riggle is actually more the straight guy to Johnson and Wayan's comedy and he's great at it. He was probably one of my favourite performances and worth seeing! One big thing that Let's Be Cops did right was to give this action/comedy film a really good villain. I love a good villain in any film and they really nailed this. He is sort of stereotypical and monstrous but it works on two different levels. James D'Arcy and Andy Garcia both have terrific roles. Honestly, they really took this up a notch by being completely evil and adding so much to the story. Much like Lethal Weapon who flawlessly perfected action-comedy so many years ago, they gave Let's Be Cops near perfect villains to give the story some edge. Nina Dobrev who I've never been a huge fan of is okay as the lead girl and Wayan's love interest. She's not a great actress and they sexualize her too much to have any character depth. When she's trying to be serious, it seems campy and she doesn't fit the cast at all.I assumed after seeing the film that whomever directed it probably didn't have a lot of experience. As I said before I enjoyed the movie far more than what I expected to but I also saw a lot of flaws in its silly and stupidness and overuse of drugs and sex rather than focusing on the fun angle and more on the action and plot. Director and co-writer Luke Greenfield has been around quite awhile and did direct pseudo-cult classic ""The Girl Next Door"" but I still think he could have done more to make this work better. Its good but because of the similarities from other films that I have mentioned previously I think it could have been great. Or maybe because it was too similar to things that were done so long ago, it could have never found new ground to tread on. Regardless, you can enjoy this and if you went in thinking you were about to see some masterpiece of cinema then you only have yourself to blame. Even if you saw all the funny parts in the trailer, you should have known exactly what to expect. The trailer did show most of the gags but the action and decent plot and actual character development in some cases are surprising enough to entertain you. I liked it...so sue me. 7.5/10",Let's Be Cops
18,bowmanblue,"Definitely not high-brow, but not bad either",7,24 February 2015,"'Let's Be Cops' seems to have certainly got mixed reviews. There are those who are absolutely slating this film online and I have to say that, judging by the general promotional material surrounding it (and general look and feel), I did expect something pretty awful. Maybe that's the key to enjoying the film –don't expect too much. I actually quite enjoyed it.It's about a pair of mates who accidentally attend a (non costume) party dressed as L.A. cops. They stay in uniform for their ride home and quickly realise the effect their costumes have on the general public. So, guess what... they decide to play on it and the film gets going...The first act of the film then plays out as a kind of 'sketch show.' Each scene is effectively a different event that our two 'cops' encounter that generally comes across like a montage. Okay, so there's no real 'story' here, but it's actually quite funny.And the two leads are good. I didn't really know too much about the actors, but I read that they're comedians and it does seem to come across. They certainly have chemistry together and it's the chemistry which generally holds the film together.Naturally, there has to be some story in there somewhere. We see that impersonating the law can lead to bad things. And bad things start to happen. Therefore, it's quite hard to make 'bad things' funny. And the jokes aren't as relentless as the film keeps going.What you have is basically quite a funny comedy which then borrows from action/generic cop films as a vehicle to wrap the jokes in. If you want to enjoy this, don't expect too much. It isn't perfect, but it's not that bad either. It is possibly about ten minutes too long, so perhaps it could have been a little tighter. And there is this female character who annoyed me with her 'unrealistic' behaviour, but, thankfully, she wasn't in it that much – minor niggle.",Let's Be Cops
19,ThomasDrufke,Pretty Big Letdown,6,12 August 2014,"For a movie with citizens pretending to be cops, it sure pretends to be as funny as 22 Jump Street. The trailers looked hilarious, and Jake Johnson & Damon Wayans already have the built in chemistry from New Girl so it had the makings of a fun summer blockbuster. But after the first 30 minutes the movie ends up being just another forgettable buddy cop film.Johnson and Wayans did share some moments with each other and the film doesn't lack a supporting cast like other films do. I liked Riggle, Dobrev, and even Andy Garcia for the extended cameo. I definitely could have done without James D'Arcy as Mossi AKA the prototypical Jump Street bad guy. The difference here is that with the villains there was a lack of comedic relief. The premise of the movie is already unbelievable, you might as well poke fun at yourself. Instead, it chooses to take a few twists and turns that wont necessarily surprise you. The best parts of the movie are in the first quarter, after they had just put on the cop uniforms. I have to say, there is almost a 20 minute long segment near the end, where I didn't laugh once, not even a chuckle. Sadly, the trailers showed most of the insane gags that I didn't laugh out loud as much as I would have liked. With Neighbors and 22 Jump Street I missed many jokes because of the amount of time I spent laughing. But here, not only did many of the jokes miss, but I was too busy yawning anyway.The scene with Wayans face getting plastered with another man's genitalia was horrifying and I refused to look at the screen for a few minutes. But I think the dynamic between Johnson and Wayans is fun to watch. They both share different outlooks on life but at the same time have a connection that resembles Tatum and Hill from Jump Street. It's nowhere near as funny as Jump Street or the trailers in general, but if you go with a few buddies you may get a few good laughs out of it. I don't recommend spending 10.75 on it though.+Johnson & Wayans work well together +first 30 minutes +Dobrev's beauty-Trailers took the jokes -Long periods without laughing -Tries hard to be like Jump Street.6.2/10",Let's Be Cops
20,lesleyharris30,"Not Funny or Memorable,",2,6 September 2014,"Let's Be Cops is a terrible movie with a really poorly written storyline and a decent cast that sadly had no way of making this enjoyable.The two main characters are unlikeable from the moment you meet them and you don't care about them or anything they're doing for the whole movie.It is also just not funny,some parts were enjoyable but absolutely nothing had me properly laughing,I think Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. are both good comedy actors,particularity on New Girl,but they just could not improve on this brutal script.Rob Riggle and Andy Garcia are the movies highlight,it was great to see someone deliver some comedy that actually worked and some good dramatic acting,but they both deserved so much better than this.The movie is also about a half an hour too long,you really don't care about these characters at this point but the story just keeps going,it's only 100 minutes but I honestly thought it was passed 2 hours,I don't think I had ever felt this bored watching a comedy.Little laughs and unlikeable characters,I regret paying money to see this movie and I highly recommend you don't.

21,cosmo_tiger,A movie that tried way too hard to be funny and it ended up feeling forced and not funny.,5,6 October 2014,"""Yep, they think we're real. So let's be cops."" Ryan (Johnson) and Justin (Wayans Jr.) have been friends forever and both have fallen on hard times. Justin is trying to pitch a video game idea to an unwilling boss and Ryan is living off money he did for a commercial. When the get invited to a costume party they show up dressed as cops. When everyone starts to think they are real cops they go with it. Things are going great until they mess with the wrong gang. After the success of 21 Jump Street the buddy cop genre has started to make a comeback. I thought Ride Along was funny but Kevin Hart gets a little annoying to me if I watch for him long periods. My big problem with him is that he seems to try way to hard to be funny. That is the biggest problem with this movie. The movie feels forced and seems to force you to laugh, but you don't. The actors didn't seem comfortable and that really hurt the movie. The only person I found funny was Rob Riggle, but that's because I think his delivery is hilarious. Overall, a movie that tried way too hard to be funny and it ended up feeling forced and not funny. I give it a C.",Let's Be Cops
22,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,11 November 2014,"Let's Be Cops The key to impersonating a cop is timing your car siren to every red light.Good thing the imposters in this comedy know the tricks of the trade.When a video game designer, Justin (Damon Wayans, Jr.), and his unemployed roommate, Ryan (Jake Johnson), attend an event dressed as cops they immediately notice a difference in how they're treated.Adorn by women, respected by the elderly and fear by criminals, Justin and Ryan fall under the sway of the uniform's power.But when an overzealous Ryan uses his bogus authority to bust-up a drug czar's (James D'Arcy) operation, his actions land him and Justin in hot water with the kingpin - and his partner (Andy García).Despite its implausible plot, Let's Be Cops is a surprisingly uproarious comedy, with great lead chemistry, endearing side characters and an oddly inspiring script.As for tells: real cops don't hold their guns sideways.

23,ironhorse_iv,"Like a cop at a crime scene, I'll say it to the people watching it: OK, move along, nothing much to see here in this movie. Really, there isn't much to look at.",6,24 August 2014,"Good Cops? Bad Cops? Let's be cops was alright cops. This movie is like a buddy cop movie, except they are not really cops. Let's be Cops is about two longtime friends, reject video designer Justin Miller (Damon Wayans Jr) and washed up college quarterback, Ryan Mallory (Jake Johnson) whom truly direction-less in their lives. It wasn't until, they put on police uniforms for a costume party, that they realize the fame, and respect that comes with the badge. They continue to act like real life police, but soon, drew attention from both the local Russian mob boss, Mossi Kasic (James D'Arcy) and a corrupt police, Detective Brolin (Andy Garcia) when the fake cops start to interference with their plans to sell, police equipment in the black market. Now, Mallory and Justin Miller must find a way to stop the mob, while also keeping their secret, from the real police like Patrol Officer Seagars (Rob Riggle). The movie has a lot of recycle jokes taken from other movies like a grown man beating kids in football or a character get tackled by a fat naked guy so we can watch his testicles get rubbed on his face. The movie barely has anything new to bring to the table. After a while, the comedy just dies down, as the second half, become more and more seriously tone. The melodrama itself choke the humor into submission and become least fun to watch, toward the end. It didn't become light-hearted until during the credits, where they show them, playing around, again. Honestly, I can care less about Justin Miller's arch, because how annoying he is throughout the film. Damon Wayan overacts here. Always acting way too uptight, scare of everything, and moaning. His character is such a hypocrite. By the time, he has his hero moment, you just don't care. It's not like it matters, because they screw up that part, by have Damon Wayans act even more like a coward. His character was such a killjoy. I love Jake Johnson as the laid back, imprudent type character. He play the role, well, as he wasn't too pure obnoxiousness. His character was very too self-centered or narcissism idiotic enough to hate. He honestly had more of a sense of morals than what Damon Wayans's character was complaining about Mallory. In my opinion, I think both of them do have great screen chemistry together. Still, it could had been better. A good example of good fake buddy cop characters, is the two duos of USA Network Channel's TV Show's Psych (2006-2014), about two friends conning the police into thinking they're psychic detective. This movie should had made me feel the same way that shows does. Good. I didn't feel good, watching the two leads. The supporting cast was mostly alright. This is one of the very few, Rob Riggle's movies that I can really stand watching him. Keegan-Michael Key was also great in a cameo role as an eccentric Latino nutcase. Honestly, I didn't know it was him, at first until a closer look. He was bedecked with tattoos and various jewelries speaking amusing broken English. Good job from him. He really got into his small role. The female characters were a bit dry. Damon Wayans's character relationship with Josie (Nina Dobrev) seen a bit forced. Also, Josie only find him attract due to his social status as a fake cop. That's not real love, at all. I really doubt, these two, really care about each other, after all, Justin Miller after setting up a date, was willing to stop a fight between two sorority girls, because he thought they were going to be hot, while wasn't the case. One great highlight for me was the villain played by James D'Arcy. He remind me of a modern day, William the Butcher Cutting, with his acting throughout the film. I love, every minute of it. The action was so-so. Nothing much or new. The car chase and shoot-outs were way too short. The stunt work was alright for the most part. Overall: Sadly, this movie kinda disappointed me. Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst movie, it's just mediocre as hell. We have a 187 here. Victim is known as the movie ""Let be Cops', suspect shot it down. Yes, I did! Bang!

ITs very rare to see a comedy movie this good these days.Verdict: Lets be smart. Go see the movie for once.,Let's Be Cops
25,Floated2,An Interesting take but not very funny,5,23 May 2016,"Let's Be Cops was relatively a surprise summer hit released in August 2014, which is great considering the two leads are not A-list actors and are relatively unknowns. Having motivation from 2014's Ride Along as well as the Jump Street franchise, Let's Be Cops was most certainly green lit on the verge of those big films. The film is rated R which is a surprise considering Ride Along was rated PG-13, however in this film the rated is only due to several scenes of language. It could have been lowered to make it PG-13 but the studios allowed it with such a low budget- approximately $17 million. Let's Be Cops has a main plot, as well as several other subplots along the way. The film is quite entertaining and the two leads do have enough chemistry, but the problem with this film is most of the jokes. Unlike Ride Along and the Jump Street franchise, this film's writing is not clever as those and the laughs aren't brought upon in this film which is why the film isn't as good. Many forced jokes and gags include in this film. Although the film is predictable, it is quite a decent watch to wait until the end to see our heroes reach this goal and success.==================================================================== ====================================================================After a rewatch (08/20/17'), Let's Be Cops really isn't funny at all, and the comedy feels very forced and the type of cheesy comedy seen on television shows forced for laughs. The first half of the film is where the comedy is played, then the second half it gets more serious when the leads become in real trouble as targets. It's also quite boring and at a run time a little over 1 hour 40 minutes, it feels over 2 hours at some points. Of course films like this are always predictable, as we know they will win in the end and the leads will receive their goal. Overall, Let's Be Cops feels worse on a second viewing, and is not memorable and too interesting.",Let's Be Cops
26,eddie_baggins,Has its moments but highly forgettable,4,9 March 2015,"A man who has directed the Rob Schneider ""comedy"" The Animal and the even more awful The Girl Next Door doesn't exactly instil confidence in the audience about to watch his newest big screen creation Let's Be Cops, but thanks to some at times energetic and chemistry filled performances from leads Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr., this comedy is always watchable despite its many varied downsides.Plying their trade together on the hit TV show The New Girl, Johnson and Wayans Jr. have a clear affiliation together and it absolutely makes Let's Be Cops more watchable. While the actual characters that Johnson and Wayans play are anything but original, they both do enough to make the deadbeat heroes of Ryan and Justin endearing enough to handle. Johnson gets the best lines as his Ryan is a fast talking man child that dreams big and achieves little while Wayans is a little more subdued as Justin but does get some of the films best moments involving an untypical burglary and a high tension party but many jokes within the film fall a little flat and after 30 minutes or so you get the feeling that the creators here didn't exactly know how to take the seriously over the top story.Let's Be Cops over reaches in its story stakes, you get the feeling that if things remained more basic we could've actually had a lot more consistently funny scenes. The initial scenario of these deadbeats realising they can pass as cops is where the film has its brightest moments, we needed more of these random encounters and less generic love story involving Nina Dobrev's Josie or cookie cutter bad man in the form of James D'Arcy's Mossi and later on the slumming it Andy Garcia as Brolin. The film really losses steam after the opening stanza and the charms of what was happening quickly turn into an uninteresting story and when the film try's to tell us some life lessons, the groans will begin.At times a whole lot funnier than you would've thought but then again it becomes something we expected all along, Let's Be Cops is absolutely watchable but far from highly recommendable. After a huge box office haul and some nice audience reaction however it looks likely that Let's Be Cops will have a chance to rectify its issues in a sequel that will hopefully take note of what worked here and what totally tanked.2 self-promotions out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check into - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Let's Be Cops
27,leonblackwood,Gets a bit silly after a while! 4/10,4,1 March 2015,"Review: This movie started off well but then it goes downhill once they try to take-down the big time kingpin. The whole concept of 2 down and out best friends who wear a police suit to a school reunion party and realise that they were getting respect on there way home, was pretty good and there was some funny scenes at the beginning which cracked me up. Damon Wayans Juniors constant whining got on my nerves after a while but the other so- called cop was funny throughout. He was much more realistic than Wayans and the storyline does get a bit out of hand after a while. If the director stuck with the ""guys impersonating cops"" theme except for bringing in the ""taking down the drug lord"" storyline, I would have enjoyed it much more because the funny element goes and the fact that they really could be in trouble, takes over the concept. On the plus side, I liked the chemistry between the two best friends and I did think that the people's reactions to police being around was quite realistic, but its more silly than funny. Average!Round-Up: I honestly think that I saw all the best parts in the adverts, which made me really want to see this film. Jake Johnson, who also starred in 21 Jump Street and Bad Neighbours, was the best thing in the film because he came up with the best ideas and he didn't seem over the top. Damon Wayans Jr., oh the other hand, over acted all the way through the film and I didn't really find him that funny. He's also starred in the Other Guys and supplied his voice for the new Big Hero 6 but I haven't seen him in anything else. After the films success, there more likely to come out with a sequel or it might boast the duo to major stardom but I honestly expected better after hearing all the hype surrounding the film.Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $136.6millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about 2 down and out best friends who impersonate cops to feel better about themselves. 4/10",Let's Be Cops
28,TheMovieDiorama,Let's Be Cops handcuffs itself into being the laziest comedy I've ever had the misfortune of watching.,1,12 September 2019,"This is a first, ladies and gentlemen. I have never done this before in the entirety of my life, let alone in my current amateur critiquing days. You ready? Approximately fifty minutes in, I turned off the film. I couldn't do it to myself. I just couldn't! This. THIS. I made it through 'The Love Guru'. I survived 'Jack and Jill'. I watched 'Movie 43' and lived to tell the tale. But not this simple-minded ""comedy"". It flamboyantly waved everything I despise about modern American comedies right in my face, and I screamed ""No!"". Sit back and prepare yourselves, this isn't going to be pretty. Two friends, who are deemed failures in life, dress up as police officers and impersonate them in an attempt to spruce up their lives and have fun.At the time I turned it off, the tone somewhat shifted into tackling local vigilantism with some strands of ""taking justice into our own hands"", but I didn't care. I witnessed enough torturous humour to cement my sentiments early one. As you know, I'm not susceptible to comedy. Without tooting my own police siren, my resistance to laughing is impenetrable. Fortunately there was no struggle here, as not a single line of dialogue was effective. No smiles were cracked. No chuckles were heard. I was dead, inside and out. Let's Be Cops is, essentially, a five minute sketch drawn out for an hour and a half. You aren't going to take anything away from this feature. Nothing. Just the solidification of one's natural ability to withstand self-torture.Firstly, are the main characters that are so abhorrently frickin' unintelligent, that they had to physically type the words ""impersonating a police officer offence"" into a search engine, and be subsequently shocked by the revealed punishment? Have modern audiences degraded their minds so substantially that they find a naked obese man body slamming into one of the ""cops"", resting his sweaty genitals gently on their cranium, hilarious? Have we, as a species, become so unsophisticated that finding enjoyment from a child being forced to stab a man double his age to be outrageously funny behaviour? I apologise that I like my comedy with a hint of intelligence, but this was woeful. Absolutely frickin' dreadful. I'm sick and tired of these modern traits plaguing the genre. ""Oh, well if we have the characters dress up as officers, then atleast we can shove ten minutes of partying, purchase a soundtrack predominantly comprising of dubstep and get those pubescent teens booking tickets immediately!"".The screenplay literally comprises of scenes, unconnected to each other, that play out as if they were one minute YouTube clips. Ah, they got the wrong dress code for the masquerade ball! Woops, frickin' hilarious though, right? Game developers wanting to make a video game that includes zombies. I can't breathe. No, not because it's so funny that they are commentating on an entire industry, but because they ARE commentating on an entire industry. God frickin' damn. Johnson and Wayans had no chemistry. None. The former wouldn't shut the hell up and was infatuated with the sound of his own voice. The latter looked so out of place and timid that Johnson was just eating him up alive. Then the sexism. Oh God, the sexism! It's ridiculous! A group of women floundering along shouting ""Ohhh we have to kiss cops *mwah*"". Go away. Stop. Enough.You want to make a pro-police comedy? Grab a notebook, watch 'Hot Fuzz' and record the amount of times you laughed. Was it more than once? Well, that'll be one more than this piece of soul-draining pointlessly stupid incomprehensibly anger-inducing ""comedy"" has to offer.Y'know what? I'm not even sorry I didn't finish this. Which is a shame, as D'Arcy looked to have put in a good performance. However, life goes on. This is the turning point. I'm not buying another modern comedy again. Unless they're unanimously praised, I'm avoiding them like the plague. Quite possibly one of the worst comedies I've watched, capitalising on crude behaviour for apparent laughs.

29,taylorkingston,So funny...,8,15 June 2015,"I honestly hate the fact that this movie got such poor ratings and such poor reviews. I think this movie was so funny. I loved seeing Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. pair up in a movie, after being co-stars on New Girl for so long. The only problem was the fact that instead of seeing Ryan and Justin, I constantly saw Nick and Coach (their New Girl characters). They have amazing chemistry, and add the fact that one of my favorite actresses, Nina Dobrev, was also in this movie, and you have an instant win, for me, anyway. This movie is about two struggling pals, Ryan and Justin. They decide to dress up as police officers for Halloween, and people think they're real cops. So they think it would be fun to play the part. But then they get tangled up in a real-life, real-police situation involving mobsters and dirty detectives, they have to put on those fake badges once again, and try to make things right.Recommended for: Jake Johnson fans, Damon Wayans Jr. fans, New Girl fans, comedy fans.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Awesome.",Let's Be Cops

Particularly in contemporary world when passers-by have lots of recording and social network options. The movie in question contains also lots of clichés, but they are used rather wittily, and skillful directing/cinematography creates some distinct scenes and solutions. Performances are not the best, but their naturalness makes amends, enabling to follow the movie seamlessly, without blah! feelings or banal jokes about sex or genitalia...Thus, unless you desire to find profundity and analyze logic of all events, Let's Be Cops is a more-than-OK crime comedy for entertainment.

Movies that parody actors is a well-established genre. In this case, the parody is amusing, and at times outright funny. Damon Wayans and Jake Johnson work well together as a comedy team. Like with Tropic Thunder, they are actors who find themselves in a situation where their acting skills actually pay off. Although the story is contrived and superficial, it's a comedy so that is to be expected. The movie avoids making any political statements about the police and sticks to trying to generate laughs. Russians are portrayed as bad guys and in overtly stereotypical ways. This is part of an ongoing trend in movies of demonizing Russians, a practice that is loaded with social and political connotations.

Jake and Damon are thirty something year old guys living together trying to make it big in Los Angeles. Jake relives old football glories and Damon works at a video game company, but he hasn't sold one of his ideas, yet. Nina plays a waitress that Damon likes but he just can not get up enough nerve to ask her out. Jake and Damon go to a costume party dressed as cops and are mistaken for real police officers, on their way home. They get the idea to keep impersonating cops for the fringe benefits-one of them is that Nina now pays attention to Damon. But, sooner or later, you know they are going to get into some actual situations where real police are required. Rob plays a real cop that has a couple of run-ins with our imposters, and eventually, they all cross paths with a real bad guy, played by Andy. It reminded me of 21 Jump Street but it wasn't quite as good, more like a 'B' grade version.

By the way I personally am serving a life sentence in the Corny Movie Puns Punitentiary; see what I mean. Anyways. ""Let's Be Cops"" stars Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. as two down-out Hollywood roommates who decide to impersonate themselves as police officers after they dress up as cops to a masquerade party, and witness that being a cop has it's perks. I would have handcuffed this enticing premise with a more enigmatic narrative, but it seems that Writer-Director Luke Greenfield did not siren that up; this Luke had no force with him in directing & scribing ""Let's Be Cops"". Johnson and Wayans Jr. were partners in thespian overacting in their arresting starring roles. I chuckled a couple of times in ""Let's Be Cops"", but let's be serious, that was way too little chuckles in a movie that desperately needed back up in creative storytelling.

The premise of this film sees a couple of downbeat guys in los Angeles who dress up as cops to a party and then start to act as cops until they start getting into trouble with the law. Now easily the best part of this film is easily the chemistry between Jake Johnson and damon wayanas jnr and it is what makes this film watchable. It's the interactions between these two guys that is the best part of the movie and sells you on this idea. The guy who plays the real cop is perfect for the role and he was really funny in the role which definitely added to the film. You don't buy either the girl that is involved in the romance or the villain in the film because they are pretty cliché in the film. The premise of the story is great, with these regular guys acting like cops it is cool to watch and makes you feel like you could do this same thing. However, it gets totally drawn out and it becomes convoluted and you really don't care about the deep more dramatic stuff. The script is a mixed bag, it provides some fun moments and food laughs but then it just tries to get all dramatic and you really don't care about it.

37,estebangonzalez10,Let's Not Be Cops Please!,3,31 October 2014,"""I look like somebody hit me in the face with Lil Wayne.""Let's Be Cops is a buddy comedy that falls flat as a feature length film and makes one wonder what the director and the rest of the crew were thinking when they decided to make this. I could understand how this might work as a short two to three minute sketch in Saturday Night Live, but you need much more than the simple premise to make an engaging full length film. I can honestly say that I laughed at two or three small scenes, but the rest of the jokes felt completely forced or out of beat. It was also rather unfortunate that once they established a solid funny scene instead of building on that moment, the film was edited in such a way that every scene felt disconnected with the other. Let's Be Cops also lacks originality and many of the jokes that didn't even work in the first place are repeated throughout the film in a predictable manner. I assure you that you will laugh more from the trailers than during the entire film. There is a moment halfway through the film where the pacing also becomes an issue and you can't wait for the credits to begin rolling. I tend to like films with this similar premise of people pretending to be cops (I was one of the few people who actually enjoyed Martin Lawrence's Blue Streak), but the premise isn't enough. Let's Be Cops is just too tiresome, lazy, and repetitive. I haven't watched Luke Greenfield's prior films, Something Borrowed and The Animal, but I had really enjoyed The Girl Next Door. After this film I really don't care too much for his upcoming projects because the directing was a major letdown. I know that a huge part of the success of these buddy comedies relies on the chemistry between the two lead actors, but there were several technical aspects of the film I had a problem with as well. The editing was poorly done, which hurt the overall flow and pacing of the film. The script was also a major letdown as none of the characters had any interesting or memorable lines that teenagers would be quoting for years to come. Nothing stands out either.Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. might be great together in New Girl, but in Let's Be Cops their scenes felt so forced that the comedic elements never work. If one of the best things about 22 Jump Street was the strong chemistry between Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, then one of the worst things about this movie was the lack of chemistry between the two leads. Just thinking about this makes me want to give 22 Jump Street a higher grade. I wasn't a huge fan of that sequel, but the chemistry was so strong that it worked. Not even the talented Andy Garcia was able to give a saving performance here. If Nina Dobrev continues to choose scripts like these for her next films, she might as well stick with The Vampire Diaries. The only character I sort of enjoyed here was Rob Riggle's, but he wasn't in this film very much. In summary, I would recommend you watch the trailer instead of the film because I promise the trailer has better editing and you will laugh more.",Let's Be Cops

40,aidanratesmovies,Surprisingly Hilarious,9,31 August 2020,"With some great chemistry from Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson, Let's Be Cops proves itself to be a surprisingly funny and very entertaining action comedy, that may seem familiar, but is quite enjoyable. I'll start off with the films flaws. The beginning of this film can feel a bit underwhelming, and even a bit choppy for some reason. It can be a bit predictable at times, and there are a handful of cliches that you have certainly seen in other cop films. However, despite all this, the film is able to be a incredibly hilarious action comedy- with laughs to spare. I loved the pairing of Wayan's and Johnson, as well as the improvisation of a lot of their lines and characters, as well as some from the rest of the cast. There are a few other supporting standouts in the film: such as Rob Riggle, Natasha Leggero, Keegan-Michael Key, and Andy Garcia. The film makes use of its wild and fun premise, and actually puts a lot of thought into the plot of the film as it goes on. It may not be the most realistic comedy, but I can certainly say I appreciate the effort it took with wrapping this film up, and giving it a conclusion that's not only satisfying, but surprisingly well made. By the end of the film, you will almost feel like you have been taken on this journey with them. That fact, and the fact that the main characters are more than just simple cop film archetypes, is what truly makes the film so special. And one I wouldn't mind watching again sometime soon.

One of them is as wacky as they can be, pushing his friends to the limits of patience and never losing him or us. Jake plays the straight man, and he's very good at it. In fact, so good that when he lets loose it's kind of thrilling to see a guy who has the acting chops and the charms of a leading man. He is likely to have a few more successful movies in his career.The story is simple. Two best friends go to a ""costume party"" and with a little misunderstanding, they see themselves poking fun at each other and the rest of the world, only to find a few dangerous characters who couldn't care less whether they're fakes or the real thing. What matters is that things grow more and more complicated, until we reach an exciting climax.What would a comedy be without slapstick, a few romantic moments, and plenty of lies...? It all works very well, and there's a nice balance of comedy and action. It reminded me a bit of the situations in ""The Heat"" and it distanced itself from some critically praised films that relied way too much on colorful language but failed to deliver because the leads were never very charismatic.Get ready to laugh and have a good time, and we just keep hoping these cops have some more adventures down the road.",Let's Be Cops
42,Amari-Sali,"Imagine Brooklyn Nine-Nine the movie, with no one actually being legit police, and it starring the guys from New Girl.",7,15 August 2014,"Consider this the film starring those who you would probably never think of when it comes to getting first billing. For while Jake Johnson has done well for himself with New Girl, as well as his indie movies, and Damon Wayans, Jr. is the 2nd generation of the biggest comedy family since the Marx brothers, neither really seem like the type you can imagine being stars. But in this film they certainly try to prove the world wrong. The question is: did they succeed?Characters & StoryTwo men who just hit 30 are realizing their move out to LA is pretty much a bust. Ryan (Jake Johnson) has for 8 years been the guy who should of went pro in the NFL, but now is just known for a STD commercial. Then his best friend, and roommate, Justin (Damon Wayans, Jr.) is this wanna- be game designer who pretty much just takes notes at meetings and is never taken seriously. So during a college or high school reunion, strangely in LA despite them being from Ohio, they dress up as cops and as more and more people think they are cops, and treat them with respect and admiration, they start to really dig the effect.Ryan especially for with him living off of the money the STD commercial got him, he is in real bad shape. But with the badge he gets the respect and cool factor he had when he was a star athlete, and with the badge comes Justin's love interest Josie (Nina Dobrev) taking an interest in him. But things start to get a little too real once Ryan and Justin stumble upon a Russian gang issue where Josie works. Leading to them having to face off against Mossi Kasaic (James D'Arcy) and his organization. Something which leads to them getting shot at, nearly caught by the police, and you being left wondering if all the fun and games perhaps may lead to one, or both, of them ending up dead.PraiseI'll admit I walked into this movie with very low expectations. If just because no one's name from the director/ writer down to the stars really make you think, ""Yeah, this is going to be one good movie."" Damn if I wasn't wrong. For with a laugh count of 31, if you include the credits, and the laughs being continuous throughout, the movie may not reach the heights of a classic, but it is good enough for you to understand why it wasn't something straight to DVD or premiering on Comedy Central. For both Johnson and Wayans not only have good chemistry with one another, and bring on quite a bit of laughs, some of which went over my head but made the people next to me roar, they also are capable of showing a deeper side to their characters.What I mean by that is, unlike a lot of comedians nowadays, you can see both actors are just as much capable of making you laugh, as trying to show you the human side to this characters. Like Ryan being a has-been who technically never was anything. You can see that he fully-aware of what people say, how much of a disappointment he is, but he still tries to fight through whatever negative emotions he has so that he doesn't end up pensive like Justin, or perhaps depressed. Then with Justin, you get to see him bring on a taste of adulthood reminiscent to Seth Rogen's character in Neighbors but without the topic being delivered so heavy handed. Making for an overall good balance of action, character development, and a laughs.CriticismThe main issues when it comes to this film is that the comedy style(s) used aren't what we are used to. The film tries to combine realism and a sense of exaggeration to make it where the film doesn't try to dwell on how odd it is to see two men have a close relationship; have either of them solely aim for low brow humor to get us to laugh; or use a huge amount of jokes dealing with people's genitals. A lot of the jokes are like stuff you would come up with, but not be able to throw out there one after another.Making the only real problem being that the story isn't original at all. Pretty much it follows a check list of what is necessary for the plot including: Foreign gangsters; crooked cops; one of the guys getting tired of the other guy's behavior and that leading to them splitting; a girl who is mixed in with a bad crowd; and anything else you would expect.Overall: TV ViewingWhile this doesn't feel like it should have been straight to DVD, a VoD exclusive, or just released on TV, it does somehow feel like it lacks the panache of what you expect a film released in theaters to have. Be it because it doesn't have big explosions, the fact none of the stars have that overwhelming charisma you expect out of those who headline a movie, or just because the films is constantly trying to fight against your expectations, something about this film leaves you thinking it was good, but it doesn't leave you with a different opinion of the actors involved. Hence the TV Viewing label for while it was funny, and had a more consistent villain than Ride Along, the failure to not seek someway to really standout amongst the buddy cop genre, besides them not being cops, keeps this from being Worth Seeing.",Let's Be Cops
43,TheOneThatYouWanted,I Highly Recommend This,8,5 November 2016,Absolutely hilarious. The movie is about two friends dressing up as cops for what they think is a costume party and just go around the city pretending to be cops and goofing off. The movie is more funny than you'd except coming from a couple of no-named actors. But the last third of the film does go off the rails a little when it suddenly turns from a light hearted comedy into a serious red blooded police movie. But it doesn't hurt the film bad enough for me to not recommend it to anyone looking for a funny movie to laugh at for an hour and a half. It is well directed and well written. Both lead actors seem very talented and I think we will be seeing a lot more from them thanks to this film.,Let's Be Cops
44,Seraphion,Some pranks of being cops,6,23 August 2014,"The movie tells about Ryan and Justin, two underachieving best friends with less to be proud of. Having such a life doesn't deter them on going to a college reunion party where they dress as cops due to mistaking it as a costume party. After the party they continue on enjoying being cops, pulling a stunt on Mossi's men, real mobsters. Ryan gets more into it while Justin's nerves come and go on it, but he eventually joins Ryan. Having almost get discovered when 'assisting' real cops, Officer Segars and his partner, on a code 6 one night, they continue on even to investigating Mossi and his men. They get a perp to 'cooperate' and sneak into one of Mossi's party. Later on it turns out that Mossi's dealing with a police detective, who then finds the truth and captures Ryan. Just as the fed up Justin re-pitches his game idea, Mossi's men storm into his ex office but he escapes. Justin manages to convince Segars to the scene so a firefight ensues between Segars and Mossi. Mossi falls back and Segars instructs Ryan and Justin to flee. But the two go back to redeem themselves. Fleeing a firefight where they helped Segars, they head to the wrong direction where they get cornered with Mossi on to them and no bullets left. Although they are wearing Kevlar vests, Justin is stunned when Mossi shots through his cover. Ryan circles back and tackles Mossi. Justin takes one of Mossi's gun and mistakenly shot Ryan clearing him from Segars' line of fire, who comes and shot Mossi down.The story concept is quite nice. Although the basic concept of impersonating police officers are kind of plurally found in many movies nowadays, especially on comedies, I honestly don't remember the last time that concept is used to the extent of a full length movie. The story flows nicely on quite a quick pace, despite the many slowdown moments. The mood of the movie is also a well kept happy mood, maintaining the distance between laughs approximately the same.The jokes are nice. This movie rely mainly on the mischiefs, practical jokes and pranks as the main characters enjoy their cops impersonation. There are also a few racial content jokes and one liners. Some very vulgar albeit not nude sexually suggestive scenes are present here and there, still being resented with a comedic aim. Those contents ensure an R rating for this funny entertainment.The acting is an okay overall for me. Jake Johnson nicely maintain his character's 'can do' attitude with the least regard to the consequences. Damon Wayans Jr. on the other hand manages to pull the role of the friend fed up by guilty pleasures. It's nice to see familiar faces lighting up this movie. Big names such as action movies veteran Andy Garcia, character specialist James D'Arcy, and others like Nina Dobrev. One particular thing I like is seeing Rob Riggle here. It's like a certain comeback, or should I say payback, after I saw the Jump Street movies.And my verdict for Let's Be Cops (2014) is a solid 6 out of 10 score and a sincere recommendation to go and see. But if you consider yourself craving more of the Jump Street movies, this one the a similarly typed comedy that you can relate to.",Let's Be Cops
45,Movie-ManDan,Soon-To-Be Cult-Classic.,10,13 January 2015,"Upon its release, Let's Be Cops got negative reviews. It wasn't panned, people and critics just said it simply wasn't good. There is a group of people that loved this. Many cult classics were hated at first, then eventually get a fan base. I am part of that fan base.What people really need to know about Let's Be Cops is that it's not a dim-witted comedy. Dim- witted comedies are like Strange Wilderness, Brothers Soloman, and Dude, Where's My Car? Those are plagued with dumb characters and a lack of intelligence and heart. Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. are the main characters who are much smarter than the average dim-witted character. Johnson is pretty close, but not quite. I will admit this movie isn't very funny, nor funny as a typical dim-witted comedy. Perhaps it would have been funnier if it had more dim- witted elements and characters. Perhaps not.Let's Be Cops is about two thirty-year-old best friends, Ryan O'Malley and Justin Miller (Johnson, Wayans), who live in Los Angeles for opportunity, but think it's time to go back to Ohio. Justin works at a video game company where he is a big pushover; Ryan doesn't work and and aspires to nothing, just wishing he could play pro-football. When they intercept real police uniforms, they act like real cops, then get involved in a high-profile drug case. The first little bit when they dress up as cops and start acting like them is pretty funny because we all know everybody would try to abuse their privilege. Then the funniness starts to die down, but that is when the brains of the movie come.What makes Let's Be Cops so appealing that so many people miss is what the police work does to Ryan and Justin. For Ryan, it gives him a sense of enjoyment and pride which he hasn't had in a long time. For Justin, it gives him confidence and helps with his assertiveness. That is what the movie is all about: finding your true self. Is the movie unrealistic and silly? Of course, but that's what makes it a nice watch. Two losers put on police outfits and something changes inside themselves. They find the respect they've always longed for.3/4",Let's Be Cops
46,bkrauser-81-311064,Reserved for the Old Blockbuster Crowd,6,16 September 2014,"Don't be fooled by the sophomoric title which conjures up images of idiots pretending to be cops to pick up chicks, get free things and otherwise act like fools in uniformwait, that is what happens in this film. Still don't be fooled by the title, the movie isn't so much face-palming as it is just mildly and reliably silly.The movie stars Jake Johnson of New Girl (2011-2014) fame as a burned out former college sports prodigy who's currently unemployed and single in sunny Los Angeles. His roommate Damon Wayans Jr. is a video game designer who struggles to bring his ideas to life thanks to a petrifying fear of taking initiative. His new game pitch involves a Grand Theft Auto-type RPG boasting an authentic beat cop experience. So authentic in fact, that he borrows real police uniforms to place on his presentation mannequins. His boss doesn't go for it but at least the two can become a hit at a costume party, thus beginning a ruse that grabs the attention of the ladies, the criminals and the LAPD.The film adds very little to the buddy cop genre save a realistic performance by Rob Riggle as a legit Police officer. The villains are serviceable in menace and acting ability while love interest Nina Dobrev of the ever popular Degrassi: The Next Generation (2006-2009) is breathtaking T&A. The notion of Dobrev's character aspiring to be a makeup artist and not an actress or model is about as silly as Fred Astaire aspiring to be a shoe-shiner. Try as they might the chemistry between the two leads is cordial but no where near the level of Murtaugh and Briggs, Cates and Hammond, Lee and Carter. At best they're Freebie and the Bean (1974) without the pretense of already being A-List stars.But let's be real, this film isn't trying to be the next Rush Hour (1998), and yes that is the new marker of quality. It's a movie that tries to reassemble the old Blockbuster video crowd who rented Martin Lawrence's National Security (2003) and All About the Benjamins (2002) a hundred times because old habits die hard and The Marine (2006) was already rented out. While Johnson and Wayans Jr. may not have the established fan base of Martin Lawrence or Ice Cube, there's no denying the films refreshing lack of pretense and the actors' enthusiasm towards the one-trick pony screenplay.Let's cut the BS, what it all comes down to in movies like this is can it make you laugh? The short answer is yes and not just scattered chuckles either. Is it worth a re-watch; probably not. There are some truly inspired moments many of which are provided by Keegan-Michael Key (If Key and Jordan Peele were cast as the hapless fake cops instead of Johnson and Wayans who knows how deliciously absurd this movie could have gotten). Yet the buddy-banter all feels recycled and the action sequences are mundane.I tacitly approve even if Let's Be Cops appeared too late on the scene to be relevant. Those who are limitedly exposed to the clichés of boys-in-blue-type cinema will find something to like, especially when their parents aren't in the room. Those with more discerning taste might want to look the other way on this one, not because it's offensive, dumb or bad but because it's too little of anything.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",Let's Be Cops
47,Screen_Blitz,Could've been better than this,5,23 November 2014,"A film about a couple of guys dressing up and putting themselves on the line of duty as police officers sounds fun. However, what makes movies like this fun is some good laughs which this movie struggles with. Jake Johnson and Damon Wayons manage to steal the show with occasional funny scenes but nothing many comedy fans have not seen or heard before.While the movie was not as funny as should be, there are some scenes succeed in laughter such as the scene with Damon Wayans intimidating the criminals while Jake Johnson's character searches their car. There is also few hilarious one liners by Jake Johnson every once in awhile. Overall, this movie could have been so much funnier; especially towards the end.I recommend this film only to those who are fascinated by the plot or big fans of the two main actors, Damon Wayans and Jake Johnson.",Let's Be Cops
48,Troy_Campbell,"Hit and miss, but likable.",6,13 November 2014,"When two slacker mates wear LAPD costumes to a party and are mistaken for the real thing, they decide to maintain the ruse to keep getting the attention and respect they have always wanted. It's a wonderfully simple premise that, although skimping on realism and cleverness, offers a gag rate that comes thick and fast. It's no surprise that this quantity over quality approach leads to many unfunny jokes and flat patches, however it also yields a bunch of hilarious moments thanks to the surprising chemistry between the cast members. With a comedic sensibility somewhere between Seth Rogen's shlubby-ness and Charlie Day's hyperactivity, Jake Johnson isn't to everyone's taste yet is pitch perfect as the extroverted loser who takes the deception to ridiculous (and highly illegal) lengths. Damon Wayans Jr. isn't anywhere near as impressive and – an amusing impersonation of a psychopathic crim and subsequent drug trip aside – generates very few laughs on his own, but as Johnson's more sensible partner in crime he stops the film from slipping into complete parody. It may not be an intelligent or mature comedy and it certainly doesn't deserve a viewing on the big screen, Let's Be Cops is nevertheless an amusing diversion that would go perfectly with beer and pizza in the comfort of your own home.",Let's Be Cops
49,phubbs,Let's Be Cops,6,7 November 2014,"I think the start of this movie really sums up the present day extremely well. Wayans is pitching his new video game idea to the company he works for in a board meeting, its an idea he feels is ripe fresh original and he's put a lot of effort into it. Straight off the bat his superiors immediately start to question his creation and asking what superpowers his main character has, is he a vampire and are there any zombies in it. I detect the mocking going on here and its very very accurate of the current times, everything is all about fecking superheroes and zombies.The idea here is actually really good and I'm amazed it hasn't been tapped before. I literately only recently heard of a case (in the UK I think it was) where a man was caught pretending to be a police officer in an unmarked car with a fake police ID card or something. He actually pulled over a real unmarked police car for speeding! he got carried away with his power trip...laugh out loud! This movie takes on that premise but naturally piles on the complications and consequences. Its very simple, the two main leads pretend to be police officers after dressing up for a party. They quickly realise being a cop has perks and benefits which leads them deeper and deeper into a world they don't belong.Now right away I think everyone knows what's gonna happen here, its bloody obvious and the movie doesn't really try to cover this fact. After all this is a silly frat house/frat pack type flick which you could easily see Kevin James, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell or Ben Stiller starring in as either the straight guy or the crazy guy. So I think its pretty easy to predict what happens here, the pair abuse their fake powers with booze drugs girls, getting into clubs, driving like maniacs etc...etc...like I said its all very predictable. Right at the start the duo have a run in with some shady blokes which is blatantly the plot setup for the movie, you know they will run into these guys again as cops, get their own back, the shady blokes will turn out to be real criminals and in turn the duo will be drawn into a real cops n criminals situation.The main reason this movie does kinda work is purely down to the surprisingly good chemistry between the two leads. I've never heard of Jake Johnson but straight away he does what Kevin James is great at doing and that's playing the average Joe really well, he's a likable funny guy. Wayans isn't as funny as Johnson and unfortunately for him he looks way too much like his dad so you keep thinking it is his dad, and lets be honest...Damon Wayans Sr. is no top twenty movie star in any genre. But together these guys do click really well, they are both likable as they play off each other and its amusing to watch them bicker and fight. In the end I gotta give full points to Johnson, watching this guy get high on cop law enforcement thinking he's the real deal, actually buying a cop car, using the jargon etc...its priceless. Seriously though this role was made for Kevin James but I guess his track record is a tad tarnished at the mo from hangin out with Sandler too much. Heck they even pinched a small sketch from 'The King of Queens' where Johnson is playing football with some little kids and gets carried away taking things too seriously (good laugh though).I think this movie has similarities to James vehicle 'Mall Cop' in the sense that both films start off really well with a nice chuckle level but end up going too far. In this film the bad guy played by Brit actor D'Arcy is really quite nasty and would fit an actual adult action flick much better, he really is that intimidating. As the silly duo probe further into this criminal gang things get a bit darker as the bad guys get a bit meaner. There isn't any nasty violence or blood but the laughs tend to fall away as some scenarios get a little tense which felt a bit out of place.Again as with 'Mall Cop' the best bits are watching these guys trying to be real cops, using cop jargon they've seen from movies and TV, acting the fool, getting away with all kinds of sh*t and of course the obligatory scene where they eventually come face to face with some real cops. The thing is we all know if we could, we'd all probably do the same thing...if you could get away with it. Its that tense anarchic ride you know is wrong but it feels so good and its damn hilarious at the same time. I think both leads capture this simple thrill brilliantly as they do things we'd all wanna do ourselves. Yeah its completely stupid and childish most of the time but I think most people will come to expect that. Thing is the idea behind the movie isn't nonsense, it could happen quite easily which adds to the fun. Definitely a naughty fun time for grown ups which was quite unexpected truth be told, a nice surprise.6.5/10",Let's Be Cops
50,RforFilm,"Let's Be Cops is that stupid cop movie that most critics aren't gonna like, but I did",7,24 September 2014,"Everyone has played cops and robbers at some point. This is the most basic of imagination games a child could play not matter what part of the world or even time period they came from. It about the thrill of chasing the bad guy or being the bad guy and trying to evade the good guys. You could stage a robbery or stop a kidnapping, but this is something I could easily believe every one has done. But like most growing people, these games end as adults decide to start playing with something that truly interests them and make a career out of it.But sometimes the cops and robbers game is fun enough that the adult wants this to become their life. They'll ask for information on what the next step is to becoming a real life officer. Either they'll be scared away from the complicated paperwork and academy, denied because of something they have or done, or they possess the will to go through with it and make it a career. But you occasionally hear about those bad apples that think its funny to impersonate an officer. Like the characters in Let's Be Cops, their most likely stupid and don't think about the consequences on the people they fool.Justin (played by Damon Wayans, Jr.) and Ryan (played by Jake Johnson) are two best friends that have lived in Los Angeles hoping that their lives here would be better then in Ohio. This is not the case as Justin is a video game designer whose more of an assistant then a creative mind and Ryan is a bum friend whose football days are long behind him and living off of a commercial payday that has kept him stable. They head out to a college reunion as cops thinking it's a costume party. Not only is it a masquerade party instead, but they have a hard time fitting in with their more successful classmates.Just as they decide they might go back to Ohio, they discover something on the city streets; people are giving them double takes, the tallest of men start to slouch and the hottest of women give them smiles. The two quickly realize that people think that their cops. Ryan wants to play around with this more, now getting the respect that he's wanted after college, though Justin is more of a weak coward whose more concerned with going to prison. The two eventually get good enough to deceive the L.A.P.D. and start doing detective work for a Russian mafia.Every summer there's a movie that I'm gonna find is a surprise that I didn't expect; Let's Be Cops is the surprise. It was a movie I remember laughing at even though a lot of the gags were stupid, reminding me of something like Surf Ninjas. ButI kind of like Surf Ninjas. So why am I forgiving here and not of something like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles that was full of dumb jokes?First of all, the jokes feel like timeless jokes, as to say that they didn't rely on modern day or pop culture things that could be dated in a few years. Second, the characters are likable. Both Justin and Ryan feel like those recent college buddies that still need to find better interests, but they put so much passion in what their doing that you really want to see where they go with this. Third, I feel like that the movie is in on the whole joke of cop clichès and that most of the jokes, especially the jokes that aren't funny, are intentional.I'll give this seven fake police badges out of ten. Let's Be Cops is that comedy that will become a hit on television through repeated viewings at midnight with teenagers and college students.

Director Luke Greenfield likes to show certain things: scenes that might not be a part of the story, but add much to the story in general, the way a writer might prelude a chapter by describing something connected to, but not in line with the characters. In the end, Let's Be Cops is a movie about people. There are also many minor characters who just seem to exist in this world. Great performances help to enhance this amazing story of a friendship.

I didn't expect anything from this movie, to be honest, as the ratings are quite (too) low everywhere, and I didn't know the actors.Johnson and Wayans have great chemistry on camera and are believable in their characters, that is the most important thing in cases like this.The story is a police prank gone too far and for too long mixed with a police investigation of a drug cartel. The story is very entertaining. Of course, this is a formula of a movie, with stereotypes, comedy formulas that work every time, the ending we expect, and situations and dialogues that will make you laugh. At least made me lol several times!

At least the rational of the duo points out early on whilst the light-hearted other half is not prepared to relinquish the sense of authority his new outfit has given him and is prepared to go all the way in order to convince himself and everyone else around him that he can be a cop.Little did they know about what being a policeman entails and when they encounter a gang of dangerous criminals they realise they have bitten much more than they could chew.This is a light hearted comedy through and through.

54,DareDevilKid,"Absolutely Hilarious in Parts, Falls Completely Flat in Others",7,6 September 2014,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.1/5 starsThe buddy-cop theme gets an interesting spin in ""Let's Be Cops"", a hit-and-miss affair that amuses and frustrates in equal measure. Co- written and directed by Luke Greenfield (""The Girl Next Door""), the film follows two loser flat-mates – Jake Johnson's ex-footballing prospect Ryan and Damon Wayans Jr.'s timid but hopeful games designer Justin – as they decide to pretend to be LAPD cops after one particularly wild night of fancy dress partying.Their ensuing misadventures initially start as a means to further their drunken wishes and boost their self-esteem, but turn serious once they fall foul of a psychopathic criminal, Mossi (James D'Arcy), with high connections.Greenfield's film has some good ideas and continually thrives on the easy-going chemistry that exists between Johnson and Wayans Jr (both of TV's ""New Girl"" fame), but it's also let down by bad execution. Some of the comedy is lazy and crass, going for the obvious and low- brow rather than the innovative or knowing, and thereby pales in comparison to recent superior efforts such as ""21 and 22 Jump Street"" and ""The Heat"". The darker, more violent elements sometime sit uncomfortably alongside the lighter material, especially when Greenfield attempts to combine them in one scene.Indeed, most of the film's failings stem from misjudged directorial choices rather than shoddy scripting and at times even extend to the editing, with some moments of poor continuity during verbal exchanges proving genuinely distracting. A generous running time also creates a bloated middle section. It's largely down to Johnson and Wayans Jr. that the film still manages to entertain as much as it does, along with a couple of genuinely funny sight gags and quips. The conclusion also manages to find a better balance between being gritty, zany, and at the same time.""Let's Be Cops"" is an amiable watch that succeeds in spite of its many flaws, but you can't help but wonder what it would have been in the hands of a more competent Director.",Let's Be Cops
55,RevRonster,Starts better than it ends...,6,8 December 2014,"I wasn't completely sold on ""Let's Be Cops"" when I saw the trailer. I thought it was going to be a laugh-less comedy that does a lot of outdated cultural references and have an unpleasant plethora of fart jokes and bits about the sexualized areas of the human body. However, I will never write off a film completely until I actually experience it and, I have to say, this film surprised me because it starts out hilarious! Sadly, it doesn't really end the same way.Right as the film kicks off, it doesn't let up on the humor. It's a little silly and has just the right amount of vulgarity thrown in. Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. really make the comedy work and can make even the most unfunny bit work. The only real problem comes when the film decides to suddenly shift in tone and try to become an authentic crime thriller and, seemingly, abandon its comedy roots. The film becomes too serious and all the laughs that the film started with suddenly become a distant memory and are barely recovered before the credits hit.""Let's Be Cops"" has a fine premise for hilarity and the two main stars work ridiculously well together but the film changes so drastically and abandons its comedy nearly completely that it ends on a ""meh"" note rather than on a high note like when it began. The film is still decent and not a total waste but the film could have been a lot better if it kept its energy level up high the entire time.Hello! The name is Rev.

There could be a ""Cheech & Chong"" or ""Harold & Kumar"" series of films- with each one being these two guys somehow pretend to be another occupation with each new film. The next could be ""Let's Be Firemen"", then ""Let's Be Lawyers"", etc..you get the drift.. Just hopefully, some funnier material will come out of it...",Let's Be Cops
58,abcvision,Popo,8,30 September 2014,"Ryan and Justin, both are at a point in life when nothing seems to be working. Ryan is a former college football star and seems he can't get a break in Hollywood. Justin is a video game designer and can't get his cop game off the ground. One day on their way to a costume party, they discover that dressing like cops give them the respect and attention they crave. This leads to a path to acting like cops and being part of the LA police force. All is fun in games until they cross a real life gangster and discover that being a cop is not as easy as in the movies. A funny movie and also amazing how Damon Wayans, Jr. looks and acts like his daddy. Funny and a good story, Let's be Cops is a peek inside the police world.",Let's Be Cops
59,rooee,Brothers in law,5,13 November 2014,"This high-concept comedy from Luke ""The Girl Next Door"" Greenfield looks like it's going to be a knock-off Jump Street. Which it is, except it's somehow not terrible. Okay, the LOL-rate is barely high enough to fill the film, let alone warrant a sequel, but it stumbles through on goofy charm, decent storytelling, and no little chemistry between its leads.Damon Wayans Jr and Jake Johnson play Justin and Ryan, dumb and dumber respectively. They've hit 30 and their lives are going nowhere fast. One is a lame-ass video games designer while the other is still living off the royalties from a herpes awareness advert. After a mix-up they find themselves at a masquerade ball, dressed as cops. The party's a disaster, but the walk of shame is a revelation: chicks dig the uniform. So the pair buy a cheap replica police car from eBay and start playing a game of law enforcement. Needless to say, once they get embroiled in an investigation into evil Andy Garcia's crystal meth dealership, stuff gets heavy.The central concept is edgy enough to carry the film through its weaker moments. The idea of law enforcers abusing their position is borderline; the idea of illegal imposters abusing the position of law enforcers is something else – namely, something that did not go down terribly well with US critics. But don't let the Metascore put you off completely.The relative success of Let's Be Cops lies in its plotting, which is above-average for this type of movie, and also in its general good nature. The humour may fall flat as frequently as it soars, but at least the script is not a gross-out parade, and it isn't really out to 'get' anyone. Justin even apologises for making a racist joke at one point. The best bits are in the banter: the verbal interplay between Wayans Jr and Johnson, pairing up again after TV's New Girl. Whenever the humour broadens into slapstick the laughter dwindles sharply, the low point being a wrestle with an obese naked man – a nonsensical scene shamelessly nicked from Borat.The bad guys are genuinely threatening, particularly James D'Arcy's Max Cady-like thug. D'Arcy is playing hugely against type and it's scary as hell. This occasional sense of menace infuses the film – particularly in its strangely moralistic final stretch – with some bipolar tonal shifts. But then, Beverley Hills Cop had similar issues, and it's preferable to playing it safe for 90 minutes.Let's Be Cops is a fun night out, about on a par with the Jump Street sequel. The title, the poster, the concept, the lead pairing everything screams stupidity. No excuses. Expect dumbness and you won't be disappointed.",Let's Be Cops
60,HelenMary,enjoyable but a bit too silly to be great,5,11 July 2015,"I love spoofs. I adore comedy. I love intelligent humour where turning off your brain isn't a requisite. Let's be Cops is a funny film, there are lots of laugh out loud scenes and Wayans and Johnson are clearly buds having worked together on New Girl as well, which makes for good chemistry. Thing is, it's quite embarrassing to watch; you don't feel relaxed and comfortable watching as many of the situations they get into are cringeworthy and you don't want to watch. This film is silly from start to finish... and I don't mean Men in Tights silly, I mean ridiculous, silly. It's beyond probable. It's typical Wayans stable fodder though - think White Chicks.It's funny. It entertains. But there are too many flaws and almost deliberate gaffs, which get old after a while. I felt that it was lazy filming, done in a hurry. Probably a lot of improv, which is good, or else lazy script-writing. I don't know, this isn't going to be a classic goofy comedy like Top Secret and it didn't have the homages like Mel Brooks. Thankfully it doesn't take itself too seriously and has enough story to be interesting. Rob Riggle is always a giggle (I'm sure I'm not the only person to ever type that) and it was nice to see Andy Garcia - where's he been? Don't expect anything high-brow, it's teenage boy humour, fun Saturday late night viewing with some fun comedians pretending to be cops. It's worth an online rental and the cost of some popcorn... if you've got a bottle of wine in already. Another reviewer commented that it might be a late night hit with the frat/stoner/teen/post- club set, I think I agree. Watching it high would probably be hilarious.

67,tr91,It was pretty good,7,26 October 2014,Let's Be Cops was a good comedy. It is about two friends who go to a party dressed as cops and then one thing leads to another. Ryan (Jake Johnson from New Girl) is all for being a cop and will go to extreme lengths to be one whereas Justin (Wayans) is not so keen (but goes along with anyway).The first 45-50 minutes of this film were very funny as we watched the two guys going to various crime scenes. There were a lot of laugh out loud moments (trying to split up the women fighting and also chasing the big guy around the shop...hilarious) and a lot of witty one liners. The characters both had a good chemistry. They were stupid but very funny. I also found the character Annie to be very amusing and Josie added that bit of charm.Everything was going well until it became a bit too serious. I was having a lot of laughs and was thoroughly entertained just the way it was but the film started to drag a bit as it tried to add a real story.Overall it was still a good watch but it seemed to get caught in between what it really wanted to be.

Two 30 year old men who has got nowhere with life accidentally realizes that impersonating as cops can gain them the recognition they so desperately required in their life. Though how crazy and fat fetched this idea sound the movie pulls off some crazy stunts keeping aside some obvious plot holes side. But as it is a comedy and all we want is to laugh no idea is a bad idea.Let's be Cops is not boring. It starts a little slower than most comedy movies but gradually develop to be crazy funny sometimes. But most of the time it remains normal other than some occasional lines which can make you laugh a bit more than the rest. The reason why I kept going was because I was curious to know where the story will lead and how well the movie can pull off the predictable scenes. And I found them to be quite entertaining but not exceptional.Regarding the performances they are OK but none of them can really spark the humor as such. Maybe I was expecting 21 Jump Street out of this but the chemistry between those two does not exist here. Maybe it's a weakness of the script too. But as a comedy for light minded viewing let's be Cops is not bad at all.,Let's Be Cops

So let's talk through the thing I did like about it! -The concept is funny, original, and hilarious. And aside from a few funny moments, that's where the fun ends. Now the things that I didn't like! -The acting is bad and the characters are dumb and unlikeable.-The story is cliché and done to death. The tone isn't that funny. The pace is kinda slow at parts.-I think that's all I really have to say. So content: It is rated-R for some moderate language. It also has a very large, pretty naked man.

73,FilmMuscle,How Can We Get People To Hate Cops Even More?,6,15 August 2014,"In an unbelievable turn of events, a comedy, that promotes the badass, crime-stopping life that's seemingly led by a standard police officer, releases at the height of a colossal controversy in which the true belligerent, imperious nature of the police has become ever more apparent, thus blighting the film's humor with an ominous undertone. In reality, a viewer's enjoyment of a particular movie doesn't solely stem from the actual content's quality but also from the experience in and of itself—the people you're with, the ambiance you're encompassed by, etc. This has never been more evident, but at the same time, it complexly diverts into two separate paths of sentiment: one of sheer fun as the rest of the audience's laughter and elation mixes in with mine and produces a tremendous atmosphere heretofore mentioned, and the other of perplexity—or perhaps, even, repulsion. Now, I don't want to pose as the killjoy, but the pure obnoxiousness evinced in this film is quite overwhelming. At the very start, you have two men (Ryan and Justin) who're truly lost in their lives and have no idea of what their next step in life is, surrounded by jerks who continuously remind them of their stunted growth in potential careers. A depressing aura sets in as the sheer relevance of this predicament becomes realized, which makes you hold on in even greater anticipation for the fun to commence. Lo and behold, suddenly, that dispiriting tone of the opening transforms into the very opposite as these two disparately personified friends are inflicted with a contagious idea that leads them to don authentic police uniforms and henceforth further into their imitation of a law enforcement officer. What follows is a string of morally reprehensible acts on their part merely because they can—they obtain an (spurious) authoritative status and instantly decide to assert their power over regular people, belittling them through all kinds of mockery. Oftentimes, you can't help but laugh hysterically—I know I did—but at the same time, you begin to question your own sense of humor and the exact decency of our two (deranged) protagonists who we're following and guffawing along with throughout. Even though plenty of scenes lead to golden hilarity, the characters involved behave rather moronically and nonsensically. Who thought it'd be a great idea to speedily drive through a soccer field, populated with adolescents, in a police car just for the gasconade of it? Ryan, the genius. Who would be that franticly avid to turn himself into the police? Justin, the upstanding citizen. One also would assume that individuals couldn't possibly be this overt in their cluelessness and disquietude, undeniably arousing suspicion from everyone around, but these two imbeciles are. In addition, the plot relies on one contrivance after another—the villains are omnipresent to a laughable degree, and characters somehow run into each other at the perfect time to initiate the next plot point. In essence, this could best be described as an entertaining and laugh- out-loud funny ""guilty pleasure""; though illogical decisions and plot holes profuse its every minute, Let's Be Cops ultimately delivers the laughs and thrills, especially given the fact that its last act suddenly shifts into a crime thriller with a few satisfying twists and turns up its sleeve. Rob Riggle, Andy Garcia, and Keegan-Michael Key make very memorable appearances with the latter portraying an eccentric Latino nutcase who speaks amusing broken English and is bedecked with tattoos and various jewelries. When it concerns laughter, this film certainly comes equipped with uproarious surprises and harmonious chemistry between its two leads (Jake Johnson playing the laidback, imprudent type and Damon Wayans Jr. the more uptight, circumspect partner-in-crime). All in all, the best advice I could give to those still curious about seeing the movie: go in, forget about everything, cease any level of thought- processing, and have a good time!",Let's Be Cops
74,MUFCOK,Take this movie for what it is!,6,29 December 2014,"OK lets be honest here, If you are somebody who picks plot holes in comedies, overly analyzes them and complains at everything 'unrealistic' then this movie is NOT for you. It is possibly the most far fetched comedy I have watched all year, it's in no way, shape or form, realistic. But it is a feel good, light hearted film which is very easy watching!Let's be Cops has the same two Cop buddies feel that many films have done before, but what does save it is the fact that they aren't actually cops! It makes it different and certainly lets the creators take different approaches at times.Two middle aged best mates are both in jobs they hate and both feel under appreciated and not respected at work. They attend a party with the wrong fancy dress code, both dressed as Police Officers. They soon realise that they immediately have respect in their uniforms and take full advantage whilst walking the streets of LA. Before long they get themselves wrapped up with local mobsters and to say that things escalate quickly would be a massive understatement!This film wont win any Oscars, that's for sure, and it is far from perfect but it is fun! Justin and Ryan's chemistry is relatively believable and they do play a sort of 'good cop, bad cop' routine, but with themselves! Justin is the sensible cop who is always conscious that things are going to far, whilst Ryan is more of a loose cannon who gets into more conflicts and takes the police role much more serious. They do balance well but it does feel like an overdone relationship. Overall Let's be Cops offers many light laughs but no more than that. It is worth a watch but take it for what it is. As I said earlier, the Cop Buddies comedy genre is so saturated, this movie has many of the clichés from that genre and it does wear a little thin at times.6/10",Let's Be Cops

The party turns out to be a masquerade, not a costume party and the two leave humiliated. End of sketch? No. This joke is dragged on for over 100 minutes.While Let's Be Cops doesn't have a single, genuinely funny moment, it does offer some suspense as far as whether or not they will get caught impersonating police officers. However the suspense wears off within the first hour. It's like a comedy-stoner without enough weed. It relies more on trying to gain laughs from gross-out humor and fails at that.While Jake Johnson's character is more frightening than funny or likable, Damon Wayans Jr. does well as a pusher-over in desperate need of confidence. His character is likable, realistic and actually develops through-out the film. It isn't anything new or original but it is well done, unlike most other things in this film.After the first hour the film starts taking the story in a direction of a serious action buddy cop movie.

One night they dress up as cops for a costume party only to realize that they actually passed for the real deal. As they continue pretending to be cops they get tangled up in a real mob case. Shenanigans ensues. Let's Be Cops has a great premise for a comedy, and actually for the most part the movie lives up to its potential. While it is no instant classic of a comedy, it definitely packs some entertaining laugh out loud moments.Full Review:I only saw one trailer for Let's Be Cops, and I don't think it was in everyone's radar when it finally released. Still that one trailer was enough to catch my attention, and I was interested to see it. This movie definitely surprised me, and I actually enjoyed it quite a bit.Buddy-cop movies of all genre must have one thing right to be even considered decent: chemistry between the two leads. Johnson and Wayans Jr. both did a great job with their characters. They both had good comedic timing and played off each other really well. The jokes that are made range from really clever, to some typical clichés. Then again the clichéd jokes are not so frequent that they get tiring. Overall there was a good balance of over the top ridiculous humor to the intelligent sort. Best of all, the greatest moments of Let's Be Cops were not revealed in the trailer. So there are some surprise laughing moments for sure.In terms of negatives there really isn't that much. Yet it doesn't feel like one of the greatest comedies. The reason this is the case is because the movie just doesn't take any risks. Only the idea of being fake cops is unique, but the plot itself is very predictable and by the numbers. You can completely remove the fake cop aspect of the premise and apart from few jokes the formula of the movie doesn't change.The biggest decider for me if a comedy did its job is if I laughed consistently, and yes I did. So did the rest of the people in the cinema. It's not best comedy of the year but considering there are not many other choices at the moment for that genre, it's pretty enjoyable. If you are looking for some laughs, I think you'll be quite satisfied.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Let's Be Cops

He has no comedic timing, he is a poor clone of Rogan and many others but just a poor, poor, poor relation. Awful acting throughout, annoying voice and just plain poor.Wayans junior is the definition of irony. He clearly learnt all his acting off his dad, where as other Wayans's branched out and had mild success on their own merit, this guy is a clone of his dad, from camp acting to over the top serious moments. Again this guy had zero likability and zero charisma, neither guy was appealing and I frankly couldn't care less about either, I felt no sympathy for their ""hardships"" they were just lazy unmotivated idiots that have ruined there own lives which deserves no sympathy.It was an average failure of a film, a bargain basement DVD at best, its watchable but very, very poor.",Let's Be Cops
80,ahegde3149,Let's not be cops,2,13 January 2015,"I was hesitant about watching this one after watching 21 and 22 Jump street recently as it is kind of a similar two cop-buddies catch big criminals story. Only difference here is that Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. play fake cops. Still it is not even half as funny as those two films. Regretted wasting my time. The chemistry between the two leads is good but nothing special like Jonah Hill and Tatum.So we have Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) who is a video game designer but he hasn't been getting much of recognition. His roommate Ryan (Jake Johnson) is in more miserable position with no job and pretends to be a football coach playing with kids in neighborhood. Once at a college reunion party they dress up in police costume. Later after party on their way home people on street assume them to be real cops and these two guys seem to be enjoying the experience taking advantage of their cop uniforms. But not until long they get dragged into real mess when they cross roads with some mobsters and their leader named Mossi. Well seems like a simple not great plot which can be enjoyed as simple don't- take-it-too-seriously-type comedy. But the laughs are so few that you need to be patient with its sucky script.The characters are very dull and uninteresting. Nina Dobrev was a pretty presence but again romance is forced in just for sake of it. Also nothing surprising happens until the third act, where there is small twist. I think that was the only entertaining part of the film before again finishing off with a cliché ending.Even if many kind of liked the lead pair chemistry between Ryan and Justin, but I felt their characters were quite shallow. Its neither witty nor has some indulging screenplay with at least some but of sense. I hardly laughed once or twice during the whole film.

The film gives ridiculous scenarios and implausible situations to make the gag and main plot work, so there's that. But then there is a decent feel of realism throughout the movie. In fact, the final ½ hour of the movie is pretty much just action, chases, and gun fights. Is what happens in those situations realistic? Sometimes. The part I didn't get was, in a comedy with this main plot device, why try and walk the line so closely between both. Is it supposed to be stupid funny or gritty realistic? I felt like the director couldn't quite make up his mind so the result was not as finely hones as it could have been. That's not to say the movie isn't humorous. While not a ton of laugh out loud parts, there were many funny parts and many amusing parts. The main idea in the movie is a humorous one, and the writing for Ryan (Johnson) is pretty funny. While not amazing, this end of summer comedy does not fall flat on its face and is worth checking out if you are in need of some laughs and amusement.",Let's Be Cops

How come no-one else thought about following the bad guys? How come it was so easy to gather evidence against them, why did the actual cops not already do it? It is also hard to believe that people would do anything for cops and that they would believe you are a cop so easily in the first place. Characters: they had depth to an extend and developed to an extend but not enough, however considering that that was this movies gender not main concern I think they did a very good job with regards to that.

Both Damon and Jake are hilarious, just not in this movie and the savior of this film, Rob Riggle doesn't have enough screen time until late in the film.The premise was fresh, original and funny, but if this is the direction Hollywood is going in, we are in for 7 years back luck.The key to comedy is good writing and the writing here was horrible.

85,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,Let's Be Cops Review,4,13 August 2014,"My Thoughts:I was really looking forward to this movie when I saw the trailers for it. But this movie has committed one of my cardinal sins and that is with all the trailers and TV spots they pretty much show you all the funny moments in the film. That is always disappointing to me and I do not understand why the movie companies keep doing that. Take notes from some of the more successful R rated comedies where you do not have to show every single funny moment in your trailer to get people to come in or show us some of the scenes that maybe didn't make it into the movie.The second thing that I didn't like about this movie is that even before the halfway point I knew what was going to happen with not only the two main characters but the storyline as well. I am not going to ruin anything for those that still go see it in the theaters but if you pay attention you know what is going to happen to O'Malley (Jake Johnson) and you know how the story is going to unfold.This seems to be a recurring problem with R rated comedies, you will get like two great comedies that everyone is going to compare all other comedies that follow it and this year they happen to be Neighbors and 22 Jump Street. I do believe there is room for more great comedies especially the R rated kind but they do need to take notes from the above mentioned movies and plan accordingly.My Recommendation:I wish I could say go see it in theaters but sadly do not waster the money wait for the DVD.",Let's Be Cops
86,CrisMovieCorner,Buddy cops at their modern best!,7,24 October 2014,"I'll be 100% honest while I was looking forward to this film a whole lot, I was also very apprehensive about it too due Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans JR's characters in ""New Girl"" losing their enjoyable factor after the show hit an all time low for me. So I kind of went into the film with pretty low expectations, here is my review.Justin (Wayans) and Ryan (Johnson) have both his their 30s with nothing to their names and that feeling is really playing on both of their minds. Justin is a games designer who can not seem to catch a break in the field and the other is a full blown loser living off the money he made in a herpes advertisement and they are both stuck in their ways and know it. That is, until Ryan has the genius idea to attend a costume party in official LAPD uniforms Justin has (for making his game is safe to assume), while out and about in their newly acquired uniforms they find out what it would be like to live the life of real life cops (like we ALL haven't wondered it) the respect and admiration they have been looking for all their lives.While Justin loves the idea of a one off event rocking the uniforms, Ryan has other plans, he can't seem to let go the newly acquired lifestyle they lead, resulting in him buying an old cop car off eBay. The trouble really kicks off when Ryan and Justin end up on the wrong side of Albanian crime cartel and their leader Mossi Kasic (D'Arcy who you will struggle to recognise, I know I did) resulting in some hilarious mishaps and brilliant action sequences. With toy guns, YouTube instructions and boredom, can these two everyday guys cut it as cops? Overall, the film is incredibly funny made me regret having my apprehensions going in, I think the show runners are ""New Girl"" could learn a think or two about the dynamic and incorporate it in the show. The film isn't a laugh a minute Comedy, I personally would put it under the Buddy Cop genre along with ""Lethal Weapon"" heck it is like a 2014 version of that film, Wayan's character even references it very early on. To be honest the best part of the entire film was Wayans and Johnsons chemistry, they oozed the comedic chemistry missing from a lot of buddy comedies in recent years.I HIGHLY recommend this film, if you are like me and apprehensive about their chemistry due to ""New Girl"" let them fears fall by the way side, this film 100% makes up for it. Full of Action, laughs, character progression and relate-able to an extent characters, thoroughly enjoyable watch.",Let's Be Cops
87,InMyHonestOpinion,Let's Be Cops and do anything we want to and get away with it,3,26 December 2014,"When I seen the trailer for this only a few weeks back, It looked like utter crap, it looked cheap, common and overdone, another buddy cop film that should go straight to DVD. I mean you have to admit it's a storyline that Hollywood has done to death and knew pretty much knew straight away its plot and its ending. I knew one thing for certain though it wouldn't be a film that I paid to see. The only way I would see this film would be of a possible 2 ways A: It played on free to air TV or B: I was forced to watch it for one reason or another. Let's just say option C happened and I ended watching it after (quite obvious really after all I am writing this review on the film). It wasn't at all what I had expected I'll give it that. So the plot of the film is pretty much 2 very average guys Ryan and Justin are best buddies and room-mates. Justin played by Damon Wayans Jr (New Girl, The Other Guys) is a game developer and Ryan played by Jake Johnson (21 Jump Street, Bad Neighbours) is a washed up quarterback still living in his glory days. After Justin fails miserably at pitching his latest game a ""cop adventure"" game. The two decide that they would attend their old college reunion dressed as cops. Once they get to the reunion they realise how miserable their lives truly are and following a pact they made earlier in life decide they will leave New York and head back to their home town Ohio. As they are walking home they are mistaken to be actual officers of the law, Ryan loves the game and decides he'll go home and learn all he can from You Tube or something similar. The next day Ryan buys an actual police car and the two head out onto the streets in their fake uniforms and eBay car to deliver justice and have a laugh. On one of these trips Ryan spots a car that the previous night had hit his own and decides on some retribution. What he doesn't realise though that the car actually belongs to the Albanian mafia and he has stirred a pot bigger than he could have ever imagined. Believe it or not the plot actually works; the story is so far-fetched that it's laughable. So many of the scenes, so much of the dialogue had my cringing, it just made you feel awkward towards what was being said or taking place. I actually loved that about the film, it never took itself seriously. The director knew what he wanted to make and he was well aware it would never be a smash hit for everyone. Usually these types of film I despise, so perhaps in my old age my mind is fine tuning itself to be a little more accepting of the ridiculous. There was nothing special about the way it was shot, or it's score it's just a very average film in that way. The acting was average but the script was pretty bloody funny. I often found myself laughing out loud so if I'm enjoying a film that much it can't be all bad now can it? I wouldn't be rushing out to see this; in fact my suggestion is to wait for the DVD. I know some of you will love this and others will not but it's that kind of film, when you do watch it just enjoy it for the ride it drags you along for.",Let's Be Cops
88,anthonymora2,Let's Be Cops Review,6,22 September 2014,"So with the success of movies like last summer's THE HEAT, the JUMP STREET movies,and this year's KEVIN HART hit RIDE ALONG,I think the Hollywood beast is gonna sense that the we the people LOOVE paying money to watch buddy cop movie.So this is the latest of the bunch. Justin is a video game designer who gets overlooked at his work and Ryan is a once-famed college QB who today is kind of loser.One day,after misunderstanding the terms of a masquerade party,the two show up in legit looking cop uniforms and after,they start to pick up on little perks of debauchery and awesomness they can have fun with.Of course good fun comes with consequences as the boys get mixed up in a real,dangerous criminal empire and see of maybe they CAN be real cops and be heroes. As I said,there are a lot of cop comedies out there,so distinguish themselves from the rest of the crop,the premise for this movie SCREAMS a fun time!Like how CHRONICLE really put a comedic and fun spin on the superhero and found footage genre,LBC definitely has fun with its story.Two everday dudes put on some cop outfits and troll the streets of LA,what's not to have a blast with?Well when you look past what else the movies script has it ended up being kinda been there done that for me.What gives the JUMP STREET movies that rewatchable factor for me are those movies' heart and chemistry between the characters.You don't get those meaningful moments between laughs that make you care for the characters.However what the movie misses in heart it makes up for in insanity points.This is one of those comedies that is most fun with a group of friends.The R rating is certainly earned! Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr are the stars of this movie and handle the screen pretty well.Jake Johnson is great on NEW GIRL and SAFETY NOT GUARANTEED,here he's OK.He's definitely someone I can see in more lead roles.It's the other other Wayans brother though that steals the movie for me actually!I though he put on the best show in the movie,the scene in a gun armory was a stand out.He put on a really funny show throughout. Nina Dobrev is in this movie and SWEET Jesus does she make a scene just nice to look at!Seriously I feel like there's times when they really fixed the lighting on her to make her really look screen goddess like...other than that unfortunately that's really all her role was good for in this movie.Rob Riggle also has a minor role but I thought he was actually pretty good and rather reserved in his role. This is not a award winning movie and I'm sure that the makers weren't set out to make that but this is definitely just a easy watch of a movie.It's kind of made for a quick buck but still has enough laughs in it to make it worth watching.If you need a good movie to end your summer with your friends than you can't find a more suitable movie.

Let's Be Cops stars Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson as two losers who pretend to be cops in order to get the thrills and respect they lack in their normal lives. The movie attempts to be another version of those wacky cop movies like Police Academy or Super Troopers but unlike those movies, this movie is tragically unfunny. Every time there seems to be a setup for a joke it just peters out and in some cases, Wayans and Johnson run away from the scene, get into a cop car and drive away. The movie is not all bad though, Keegan-Michael Key of Key & Peel fame has a funny part as a dreadlocked tattooed thug but he shows up far too late to breathe much needed life into the movie.

Having bad luck was always tough, yet the two main characters of this movie showed a good-humored effort to make the most of life. Depression or hope remained as the only two choices for these two, and friendship gave each hope. A police uniform meant welcomed heroism in some places and unpleasant competition in others, and this movie illustrated the whole range.

His acting was outstanding. It will be interesting to see where he'll appear next. It is possible that we have a new Eddie Murphy or at least next Chris Rock. The plot here is quite simple and sometimes not all that believable, but all in all it's good.

93,RustyShacklefordd,One of the Worst Comedies I've Seen In a Long Time!,2,12 August 2014,"Just got back from seeing this and this really was one of the worst movies I've seen this year. The writing is horrible! The laziest type of comedy, I swear half of the jokes completely relied on swearing. Some of the jokes didn't even have anything to do with the cop premise (hotboxing the car, riding roller coasters) it was obvious they didn't have enough material to fill the entire movie so they stuffed it with cheap juvenile jokes. An example of this would be a scene were the writers didn't know how to end it, so they have a character get tackled by a fat naked guy so we can watch his testicles get rubbed on his face (comedy gold right?). And don't even get me started on them ramming jokes into the ground. Also, it ask the viewer to despend their disbelief on the level of something like Identity Thief. The story is incredibly predictable even by comedy standards. You know exactly who the villains are the second they appear on screen and the twist can be seen from miles away. There is also just poor writing in advancing the story. For example, when the girl calls Damon Wayans character telling him to come see her, they somehow know to come into the building knowing that she was being held hostage even though she didn't even imply that at all. I honestly felt a bit insulted by how bad some of the writing in this was. The tone was also stuck between along the lines between something like 21 Jump Street and something along the lines of Hot Fuzz. The third act felt like an entirely different movie and there wasn't even a good transition into it. The only good thing I can say about it is that the chemistry between the two leads was good.The most depressing thing was that I saw this in a packed theater filled with teenagers laughing like it was the funniest movie they ever saw. I swear every time somebody dropped the f-bomb or said pussy they laughed like crazy. It will probably end up being #1 at the box office this weekend and FOX will probably green light a sequel that will make millions as well. This truly is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time! I actually think it might be worse than Transformers which I thought was the worst movie of the summer up until this. I'd rather watch Kevin Smith's Cop Out a million times before ever having to watch this again. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE! I only went because a friend invited me to and it was discount day at one of my local theaters and I still feel ripped off! It doesn't quite reach the level of awfulness along the lines of A Haunted House 2, but it's pretty damn close. If it's movies like this that people are truly finding funny, then I really think we are looking at the decline of comedy as we know it.",Let's Be Cops

96,peter-stead-740-486963,Great premise let down by under-developed script,5,30 August 2014,"When the writers approached what is a very promising premise, they must have hit a fork in the road: do they go for a balls-out blast that careers through the story with sheer hubris, or go for a character comedy where the protagonists journey is relatable? What they have delivered has elements of these two different comedy styles and they do not go well together. So the buddy bonding scenes between the protagonists seem very bolted on to the increasingly outlandish story.I'm a huge fan of Wayans Jr (ever since Happy Endings) and he is versatile enough for either direction, but Johnson is only really right for more nuanced material. He just doesn't convince as the larger than life touchstone to their ill-judged (mis) adventure. They really needed Jack Black here. In fact, surely it would have made more sense to cast someone as clearly athletic as Wayans Jr as the ex-footballer/instigator of the madness and Johnson as the game programmer?The film establishes very early on that these two likable characters are kind of losers, but they don't seem stupid enough to not know that impersonating police officers is very illegal. That said, it starts out harmless enough with the two of them enjoying the female attention, and generally testing the boundaries of their new powers, and it's funny, because it is believable. But then making the jump to continuing the ruse by confronting a very frightening organised crime gang doesn't feel right for the ordinary-ish world the writers establish at the outset.As the story builds, it gets worse and worse and feels more like a collection of comedy sketches than actual scenes, which just go on and on.It's also quite misogynistic. I'm no male feminist, but the female characters really are reduced to implausible devices and on-heat brainless, but damaged, bimbos.Wayans Jr and Johnson, as well as the brilliant Jon Lajoie (Wayans Jr's boss, not well known in the UK, everyone should check out his Youtube videos) can do a lot better, but they are hamstrung by a script which seems not to have been developed beyond the first draft stage.

97,MaxHaydon1994,Worth A Watch,7,7 April 2016,"I think the thing I liked most about this film is that it didn't conform to the trends we see in comedy's in recent years.The humour wasn't aimed at things that will be forgotten in a few years. The actors are both of an appropriate age to make jokes relevant to an older and young generation, they're smack bang in the middle of old and new. It was nice to see a film that didn't reference every popular reality star and musician we all know will be forgotten in a few years time.It's also worth noting that the acting was sincere and not over baring in it's wit. Over acting in comedies has become all too common but I found this duo to be more then bearable and often funny.

103,jacob-m-ford97,Funny for now. . .,6,26 October 2014,"As you walk in the theater to watch ""Let's Be Cops"" you have to have a little bit of understanding what movie you just paid to fill up 100 minutes of your life. This is a dumb movie made in a cheap way that is intended to be dumb and cheap. I went in to see this movie with those expectations and as a result I was fairly entertained for the time I was sitting in that seat. To begin with ""Let's Be Cops"" has an absurd premise: two loser guys dress up as police officers for a costume party, and because the earth is apparently populated with people who have elementary levels of intelligence, the citizens of Los Angeles believe that they are legitimate officers of the law. In the most ridiculous and illegal ways they decide to use this to have some fun, get some girls, and get away with whatever the heck they want. But since this is a motion picture, their partying does come to stab them in the back as they get involved with a mafia- style gang, which is where we get the meat of the story.""New Girl"" co-stars Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. reteam for this film as Ryan and Justin: two of the biggest losers ever put onto the big screen. Their performances were good, granted the fact that absurd comedy is perhaps the easiest to do well in a film. Johnson specifically took on the role of a loser very well leaving you with the amount of distaste for his character which was needed to tell the story. Wayans did an excellent job of grasping the ridiculousness of the film and putting it into his character at the correct times. Ryan and Justin were not nearly as funny as they could have been, but for the budget this film was given Johnson and Wayans did an excellent job of providing very funny performances that are very necessary for a film like this to work. Also among the cast were James D'Arcy as the stereotypical villain, Nina Dobrev as the stereotypical girlfriend, Keagan-Michael Key as an over the top gang member, Rob Riggle as the only person who gets anything done, and a surprising appearance from Andy Garcia as the stereotypical gang leader.When it comes to making a comedy of this style there is a precise formula that is easy to follow, works very well, and as a result is done very often. Director and co-writer Luke Greenfield clearly decided early on to stick with this formula and it can be seen throughout the film: We start with two guys. Both are over the top, both are good-for-nothings, both are funny, but are ten times funnier when they are together. Enter a ridiculous plot which they innocently get mixed up in and is way out of their league, usually something that comes up a lot in other films and TV shows. Add a creepy villain here, a girlfriend for one of them there, and a scene where they drop the comedy and say something deep and profound. Finish it up with a moment of true courage, cut quickly to another stupid joke before the credits roll, and you're set! A guaranteed twenty-five million dollars on opening weekend. I'm not saying I dislike the formula, it works. It's irritating, but it works. At least some credit is due for that. It does bother me, however, that the films that follow the formula are often extremely successful and well-known, when there are so many really good films that take huge risks and are only seen by a select number of people. On its own scale though, this movie was fairly delightful. A good percentage of the jokes were very funny, there were numerous cringe-worthy moments, but it worked because somehow a laugh will always win that battle. The film also featured an excellent climax which was funny and even slightly suspenseful. If you do decide to go see this film, which I don't think I'd immediately recommend, go in as I did. Have zero expectations. In fact, have low expectations. You're not going to find a ""Dumb and Dumber"" or a ""Bridesmaids"" in this movie, but it isn't a terrible thing to waste an hour and forty minutes on if you go in with very low expectations. I enjoyed it for the brief bit of my life, but I do know that I don't ever want to see it again. So as I walked out of the theater, I was ready to move onto the next thing.I give ""Let's Be Cops"" a 5.8/10.",Let's Be Cops
104,Callum_Hofler,Insanely Unoriginal and Predictable,4,21 November 2014,"Let's Be Cops provides little more than a semblance of a chuckle every now and again within its elongated and highly awkward one hour and 49 minute long running time. Part the relatively well-formed chemistry between leads Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr, every single minute of Let's Be Cops is formed of something excruciatingly painful to sit through, whether it be generic and plain embarrassing fart or testicle- related humour, a poorly constructed romantic subplot which serves little but to supposedly provide character development for one of the protagonists, or scenes which just last far too long. It's a comedy without any comedy; an event which is painful to sit through.Whilst not necessarily sinking to the disgustingly low level of the humour that encompasses a film like A Haunted House 2, Let's Be Cops is filled with little hilarity. Whilst the central plot and characters are initially somewhat interesting and funny, their freshness wear out quickly, and what is exposed is a highly clichéd and predictable story, filled with betrayals, discoveries and revelations which can be spotted from miles away. The protagonist's character arcs are formed of the same old, tiring direction that we've seen in countless other comedies come before. This is nothing new and innovative.Director and co-writer Luke Greenfield has an energy and wit about him for the first 15 minutes, providing a spark of spontaneous ingenuity for the opening of this movie; he gives us hope that the film will stay briskly paced and highly funny all throughout. The central premise comes into play, and we're excited to see the primary characters take up their new found roles and exploit this new opportunity. Both Johnson and Wayans Jr handle their roles well, helping to hone what seems, at this point at least, a strong comedy. Unfortunately, after Greenfield tires out the initial concept, he continues to attempt to leech it for everything it's worth, losing the pace and wit of the film along the way. Things veer uncontrollably into boredom, and the rest of the film becomes an absolute slog to get through.Much of the humour will appeal to a good portion of the adolescent boy crowd who appreciate the Adam Sandler-esque juvenile comedy brand, despite its constant lack of creativity. This a horrible motion picture to watch play out on screen, especially after the potential it displays within its opening segments. Greenfield has an eye for comedy, and understands how to tell an effective joke or two, but held down with a concept that provides little material after its first 15 minutes, he is unable to branch outside the clichéd branch of comedy writing. His cinematography, editing, score (by Christophe Beck), lighting; all of it is poorly handled. It contains nothing of particular value, and combined with a screenplay which features little focus and drifts off into all manners of predictability shortly after it begins, Let's Be Cops is a thoroughly disappointing venture for Greenfield; a comedy director who continues to be criticised for his needlessly silly and poorly executed comedy.4.0You can check out more film reviews on www.entjunkie.blogspot.com",Let's Be Cops

I guess it's one of those situations where my expectations were at such an average level, mixed with the fact that I was really in need of something to fill the void of late summer, that I was able to just sit back and enjoy myself. Because frankly, on paper this movie doesn't really work. The plot alone is extremely ridiculous, but luckily the actors bring the film alive and push the reality of their shenanigans to the back of your mind. And though it does require you to suspend a good amount of your disbelief, it just may surprise you with the amount of laughs to be had.Set in Los Angeles, it follows two best friends who decide on attending a costume party as full fledged cops. Suddenly realizing that people are mistaking them for the real deal, they begin to take advantage of their circumstances as they up the ante more and more. But simultaneously they become wrapped up in the local mob and must complete a mission they got themselves into. Told in a hilarious self-aware style that makes fun of the normal buddy-cop clichés, it proves to be more original than anticipated. The lead duo played by Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. show great chemistry and deliver a series of uproariously funny moments that seem to never end.

Ryan (Jake Johnson) is an ex-jock, who hasn't found his calling in life. Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) is a reserved video game producer, who gets called a bitch every ten minutes. The pairing is odd itself; since when do quarterbacks hang out with video game nerds? But then they put on the cop uniforms and see that girls are looking at them differently. People actually listen to them. This is awesome. For a laugh-filled montage we see Ryan and Justin abuse every cop privilege possible; smoking pot with teens, cutting lines to clubs, making bad guys dance. These laughs are innocent, but then the film asks us to drop any realistic pretension we had. Apparently, Ryan and Justin aren't aware that impersonating a cop is a serious crime (until one of them Googles it). In addition, apparently driving on sidewalks goes unnoticed in LA. And apparently the kids in this film just moved in from South Park. So they continue to be cops, even buying a cop car off Ebay, and obtaining surveillance equipment from Office Segar (Ron Riggle), whose character is so muddy I can't tell if he's just incredibly stupid or just super dedicated to the force. It's also unclear what the bad guy, Mossi (James D'Arcy), does. Sure he's a crazed arms dealer, but his decisions in the film are never given a good reason. He's conveniently connected to Josie (Nian Dobrev), Justin's love interest, who is drop-dead gorgeous. And he likes to shoot things aimlessly when stalking his prey. Key, from Key and Peele, plays a ridiculous rasta. The tolerance for the cop jokes, at the cost of the plot, wears out at around the middle, where the movie's turn into full-on thriller saves it. Then it's about seeing how these guys are going to make it alive. The jokes are funny and very contemporary. Jake and Damon have great chemistry, but it feels like this could have just been a sketch on Key's show. Most disappointing is that Rob Riggle's comedic talent is not displayed. This is a good film to get some easy laughs in. 7/10",Let's Be Cops
107,kynick2,Ummm part 2 please,8,22 August 2014,"I'm a fan of New Girl...I'm a HUGE fan of Damon Waynas Jr based solely and initially on his work on Happy Endings (Not sure why it was cancelled). I was pretty happy to see him back on the show he left to be a part of Happy Endings and it was a given that I'd check the film out. I read a few reviews on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes and wondered should I wait to see it based mostly on negative reviews. Man, from the opening scene with Jake I was laughing every other minute. I thought the movie was absolutely hilarious throughout. The chemistry between the two stars was so natural you'd think they were friends in real life (maybe they are)it was effortless. There was a point near the end where the tone seemed to get a tad serious but outside of that 10 minutes of non laugh material, I was cracking up and so was pretty much everyone else in the theater. The scene where they took over the (girls) apartment....a very nice touch. She was pretty funny without doing much. I enjoyed the movie and can't wait to watch it again with Hope.",Let's Be Cops
108,rogerg100,A lot better than expected,7,17 September 2014,"I don't know why so many people give it such a low review. I guess if you had to only watch 1 movie a year and this is it you would be disappointed..It a classic like Beverly Hills cop of Bad boys. , but it is one of the better comedies in the last months. So two losers dress up as cops for a masquerade ball and go with it and Jake Johnson is actually quite funny in the way he just goes for everything.. no matter how crazy.. Is it often corny yes, is it very cliché yes : but does it make you laugh: yes! Is it entertaining yes. If you looking for meaning i.e. drama comedy/ family comedy/ romance comedy this is not going to appeal to you.If you just want to laugh it will. There is another part of irony. The thriller/ action part of this movie was actually better, more realistic and more clever than that of movies like Need for speed/ fast and the furious 5/6.Don't expect too much now either. it is comparable to 21 and 22 Jump street , but somewhat less funny and less original jokes.",Let's Be Cops

110,benoit_03,"Jump Street reversed, light and easy viewing.",7,6 September 2014,"Jump Street inverted is what springs to mind with this film. Instead of two police officers posing as civilians, the situation is flipped. We have two downbeat, no-prospects, losers posing as cops. So expect a few laughs, but still not the comic genius of the former.The story follows the two leads deciding to go to a costume party dressed as cops. They soon realise that people believe they really are cops, and begin to test what they can get away with, but they soon are in over their heads and it's up to them to bring down a 'mafia' style gang.The story is a standard set up that has been seen before, but that can be forgiven as there are many jokes and turns to keep you going through the whole thing.Speaking of jokes, there are a number of no-brains toilet humours and petty giggles to keep the average viewer entertained, but lack some of the cleverer wit that other films of the type have had. Nevertheless, there won't be ten minutes go by without a laugh.Wayans Jr. is welcome and brings a little comic sass to the screen, some we have come to love from his uncles of White Chicks fame, and interacts brilliantly with partner Jake Johnson who have both starred in comedy, New Girl.Altogether, you will leave happy if you are planning to see a light, easy watch. Funny characters, tongue-in-cheek action and cringe moments are abundant. But if you are looking for anything deeper and with a just a little more substance, then look elsewhere.",Let's Be Cops

With disasters like ""Blended"", ""Pitch Perfect"" ""22 Jump Street"" and the latest ""Hangover"" sequels being absolute wastes of time, I thought I would try this one out, just for the hell of it.It is really funny and well written and acted. If you are a fan of this sometimes ""Hit and miss"" genre, you will indeed get your moneys worth! The films plot is somewhat predictable, and there are no real surprising twists or a storyline, however the comedy and the way that the characters lead you down their own self destruction is quite an amusing watch.

The duo of make-belief cops is so stupid, I wonder how they made it this far in their lives without having a lethal accident. Basically it's two thirty-something guys with their careers in a sinkhole, suddenly finding great joy and opportunity in pretending to be cops.Through it all they keep doing remarkably stupid things, shamefully stupid things, and ridiculously stupid things. It appears this is where the movie delivers. You can watch almost two hours of these guys being really stupid - it is up to you to regard this as a funny thing, or as shamefully bad taste. For me, it is the latter.",Let's Be Cops

Two losers trying to make it in LA, but realizing that is not gonna happen. OK. let's watch this plot for the million time, no big deal... but when you see that Jake Johnson's success moment was appearing in a ad about hemorrhoids (or something like that), you can't avoid to get a little annoyed by the repetition, it's unbelievable that a joke so overdone like that one keeps getting screen time.This is a lazy movie, all the jokes where done before, and multiple times, it tries to appeal to being ludicrous-funny, i think, but it's just ludicrous, everything that happens appears to be the product of the imagination of a 12 year old that devotes his life to watch and love generic sitcoms. I recommend to see this, non the less, because is a very very good example of the absolute decadence of comedy, having moronic stories and repeating the same jokes of the last 30 years.",Let's Be Cops

120,fashionable_boy420,"The genre of ""Let's be cops"" should be 'boring drama' and not Comedy!!",3,10 November 2014,"The movie isn't funny. May be one might laugh at a scene or two but that's not a comedy movie right?? There are a lot of problems with ""Let's be cops"" ; from boring script, unfunny jokes, non sensible satire and one can easily carry on with this list for long time. The movie had a good idea that could have been made into a one nice short movie or something of that kind. But to make an entire feature movie on this particular idea of fake cops requires some serious direction and a strong script with better jokes and situations.Comedy movies are supposed to be funny like Old School, Rat race, Hangover, Liar Liar etc. This movie cannot make a guy laugh any longer than one or two minutes, forget about laughing for the whole length of the movie. At one point you would want it to end so badly, that you might pay more than price of the ticket to get out. Seriously it is that boring, annoying and highly unbearable to watch. In fact, i watched the entire movie just in hope that it might have something to offer in the end. And it indeed had something in the end - a social message and sheer disappointment.The only reason for me to give this movie 3 stars is because i think the actors made an honest effort, despite a horrible script given to them. The main antagonist of the movie James D'Arcy acted well and made his character look powerful and very much real.All in all, it's not a movie to watch on any given day, it's not just worth anyone's time.

The storyline is very good and all the actors have done great job except the lead cast of Jake Johnson and Damon Wayans Jr. At some points they over acted and at some points they were meek. However since the comedy itself is pretty hilarious, I would recommend it to watch provided if you can take the acting of these two. Rob Riggle is best at what he does best. I wonder why this man doesn't get some mainstream role. He is really funny. As for the director Luke Greenfield, he has a good reputation of comedy movies director. Animal and The Girl Next Door were really good but this one is better. Again only the acting puts a setback on this otherwise very funny movie.",Let's Be Cops

Even if you're not a fan of Steve Carrell and Will Ferrell, you'll be laughing your ass off on this one. Don't judge a movie by it's cover, this is a must see.There's some excellent chemistry between our idiotic leads, and some really great situational humor that is bound catch you off guard, spilling your popcorn whether you're in the mood or not.Every now and then you come across a movie that seems to have gone under the radar and this is one of those gems.

124,leostriplin,Could have been so much better,1,1 July 2021,"Truly a terrible movie. Not a single joke landed nor did it make me laugh once, and I usually have a good sense of humour. Johnson is good as usual but Wayans is one of the worst actors I've seen, he's so unconvincing in this role apart perhaps from the scene when he's drugged. None of the other actors are either funny or likeable.What's sad is that this could have been so much better, the idea is good but this film injects too much depressing matter into it and dramatic scenes, not to mention being infuriatingly predictable and stupid. It should have gone further in a lot of scenes, added more adult humour instead of the juvenile humour present. Not that any of it is funny anyway. The film goes stale almost off the bat and this is simply so disappointing as a whole. The ending is awful too. And clearly written by someone with no imagination.Avoid. Not a single memorable moment.",Let's Be Cops
125,ralph_valkenburgh,"Lets be ""by the book""",6,1 December 2014,"When I saw the ads on the Internet I thought to myself, this concept is exactly what a comedy needs. A funny yet stupid idea of 2 friends who are down on their luck (It gives enough chance for crazy/hilarious scenarios to get into). Really, what they had was a perfect mixture for a true comedy classic. Though it wasn't executed, or written the way it should have been. It felt as if some executive producer heard someone pitched the idea, and the idea alone, and then jacked it. It truly could have been so much more than it is.Character development is weak, the acting is somewhat over-the-top, the story is forced with screenplay-writing clichés, but I guess that's the new trend (don't fix what's not broken). I wish they could make a genuine funny flick (without raping a seemingly good idea), written by someone over the course of a few years, rather than a team put up to write a movie based on an idea, and that idea alone (with notations (which are improvised as the idea is being lay down to the team)), in 6 months.I was disappointed to say the least. Would I recommend this movie to anyone? Yes I would, if they really don't have anything better to do, and already watched all the latest titles.I give this movie a (somewhat undeserved) 5.7 because of the (undeserved) hype it got.",Let's Be Cops

128,billtang79,Predictable fun but with a heart,7,2 November 2014,"Let's Be Cops is one of those comedies that follows a predictable pattern. Two losers losing who they are set out for some fun. And what started off as a joke got people really in trouble so they try to redeem themselves by saving the day. But you know what, sometimes, It is nice just to have comedies that is plain out crazy so we people watching the cinema can forget about our humdrum lives for just a few hours and that is what this movie did for me. Is it predictable? Yes. Is it funny? Eh, so-so. Is it entertaining? Yes! The movie at least gave the two main actors aka 'good guys' some back story that is interesting enough for you to care about them. The jokes are stupid but funny. The movie does not overwhelm you full on with too much crazy jokes that you cringe. Don't get me wrong, there are cringe worthy jokes in the movie but at least they are spaced out well enough. There is a suspension of belief and realism here in this movie to be honest but maybe sometimes, that is good. It can be nice to just imagine one day just doing the things the characters did in the movie even if you know you can never do it and not get into trouble. That is why I think it deserves at least a 7 out of 10 even though there are a lot of bad plots and lame villains that pulls it down.",Let's Be Cops

I think most have stated that most of the ""funny"" parts were shown in the trailer and that is true, but the worst part is when they don't show a part of the movie that was shown in the trailer. That happens in this movie. They reel you in to see the movie based on the trailer and what is shown in the trailer didn't get shown on the big screen. It is just down right criminal and we keep paying for it and they are laughing at us all the way to the bank.I have sworn off professional sports because they are such opportunists and have spoiled the tradition of the game. It is getting really close to being the same for Hollywood. The only redeeming part of this movie is the end; which is quite climatic, but past that it is a mediocre movie at best.

So recent comedies have become a parody of the comedy film format. I was worried this film would follow suit, but It was a pleasant surprise! It didn't rely on cheesy funny moments and kept me entertained throughout. I want a film that gives me something different, even if it feels a little unrealistic. I mean for God sake the most popular films of this century are about a rich entrepreneur that events a flying metal suit and joins a group of enhanced aliens and superhumans to protect the universe against a giant alien with a magic glove! So being a little farfetched isn't really a reason to hate on this film. This is easy viewing and a film you go into on a Friday night because there's nothing else to watch.

There are lots of hilarious moments and the jokes hit more than miss.It's a movie about two guys who are unsatisfied with their daily lives and decide to pretend to be cops for fun but get so deep into it that they can't get out since all of their fellow cops are none the wiser (which is completely unrealistic, but this is a movie, so just go with it). And of course, since they are now forced to do real police work without any kind of training whatsoever, they are waaaay in over their heads and hilarity ensues.Surprisingly, once they start having to fight real bad guys, the movie takes a bit of a dark turn. At that point, it becomes more of a ""Lethal Weapon"" type of comedy than the silly type of comedy that came before that. The sudden change in tone is a bit jarring and kind of takes away from the movie IMO. It was as though the movie was trying to be two different things when I wish it just would've stuck to just one.Having said all that, it's still a movie worth watching and is far better than what the critics said about it.",Let's Be Cops

139,ephraimzacks,very funny!,8,7 August 2017,"man, let me just start by saying that this isn't an over the top blockbuster film like everyone seems to expect from every movie that comes out now. For some reason people have these attitudes towards movies that aren't packed with insane plot holes and story details wrapped up in a cgi blanket to attempt to blow your mind. This movie is really a funny movie, no matter what anyone says. My girlfriend was having a bad day and I was low on energy to try to entertain so we went to see this for a few laughs. It didn't disappoint. I didn't go in with high hopes that there would be any real reason to like it very much but it came around within the first few minutes of the movie. We both left feeling better and like it was worth it, (and I am an adult so the 'teenager type jokes' that one reviewer referred to are unfounded). Jake Johnson really sells the image of a guy just looking for any kind of change in his life and Damon Wayans Jr. is and actor that really puts a lot of work into whatever role he is in. I don't want to ruin any of the movie with bits and pieces that I enjoyed more than the others so I am leaving you with this. If you have a desire to get enjoyment from a film without becoming emotionally invested in a story that lasts 3 movies or longer with hints and clues popping up all over the place eluding to a next installment of whatever series, (and enjoy comedy of all types) then I would recommend this highly. Not artistic, not over done, not offensive to the degree some say, just straight up good comedy. Waaay better than the terrible Seth Rogen movie ""the Neighbors"". Hope this helps.",Let's Be Cops

Let's Be Cops does earn a 7, however, because of the plot line. Albeit being unoriginal, it had the opportunity to produce some good laughs, and it did. The premise was some what unbelievable as two friends managed to get away with federal crime for the entirety of the movie, without any notable punishments.Despite the flaws it did earn a score of 7, which for me correlates to a good comedy to watch on a rainy boring night, but not something to pay the $7 to see in the theaters.",Let's Be Cops

143,scottdelcarpio,Film class review,10,25 January 2019,"This movie is about two friends who pretend to be cops and end up finding a drug cartel dealer who is running Los Angeles. The friends try to talk to the real cops to tell them but the head of the detecive unit is the head boss of the group selling drugs. This movie has exaggerated angles, lots of close ups, and low angels. My favorite part of the movie is when they are being chased and are trying to be killed by the cartel for knowing who is involved and the two friends team up to take down the whole cartel. This movie is very funny and has action so you get action and comedy in the movie.",Let's Be Cops

145,gavinconlon,Hilarious Buddy-Cop Comedy,8,14 August 2014,"Let's Be Cops might be one of the funniest movies of this year thus far (in front of the laughable Hercules). This film portray's two dead-beat buddies who moved to Los Angeles to experience the big time, but come up short. One of them becoming a failing video game designer and the other is a lazy unemployed washed-up college football player who spends his days beating neighborhood children at his own old sport. The two dress up as cops for a party to find that civilians begin to think of them as real police men. This sends the ""cops"" to go on hilarious antics across the city, but eventually leading them into dangerous territories with violent gang members. This movie delivers high laughs when both Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson hit the streets to pretend to be apart of the LAPD. And the best part of this is...it's original. Other than the usual ""bad guys have awful aim"" cliché, this movie brings along a form of comedy that has been left out of a lot of films recently, ORIGINALITY. Go out with your buddies and see this movie, you will not regret it.",Let's Be Cops
146,imapotato1975,Comedies should be funny,2,27 October 2014,"I am spending as much effort on this review as they did on this movie.Forget the sloppy direction,multiple continuity errors and bad makeup of which the crew should take some fault. BUT, it was comedy that wasn't funny and had a lazy trope moral that was a Chekov's gun from the first 15 minutes. I didn't think Keenan could NOT be funny but he tried in this film, and Mr. quirky girl sidekick was a bit over the top in the bad way as the main guy. Damon Jr. was doing a horrible impression of his dad.I don't know if that's worse or that the government green lighted a PRO cop movie during bad press for the militarization of the police and multiple counts of bad cops.They are getting predictable...I know the CIA helped give Affleck an Oscar, but damn at least have taste over at Homeland Security before you green light something like thisI DID give it a 2 because James D'Arcy was a great villain",Let's Be Cops

I will admit I was watching while being a bit high ( but not too much) and that I know that the script was not a masterpiece, but it it's own way, since pretty much comedies have worn out any possible new scripts, this was actually a good story. But it's not so much about the story but of course it's about the jokes which were really funny, very well made and not too stupid and too goofy. And not only was it funny, but the movie had some flashes trough different genres and very well made for a comedy - there was drama, there was thriller moments, there was ofc action. And it was not extremely corny and somehow the acting was really good - so it all add up to a very good comedy because we were 5 people and we all laughed hard, so it served it's purpose. I rarely like those type of goofy movies, mainstream cop stuff (as the title suggests) but things were really well made here. I dunno - they just nailed everything, including the soundtrack.

And two main characters are so funny each in their own way. I've tried to watch a lot of new movies lately but usually I stop watching them after half an hour as soon as I see how stupid it is. But I would like to see more movies like this and I'm really disappointed that the grade on IMDb is only 6,6.

Sadly, i didn't get a chance to see this movie in theaters, but boy do i regret it. Although i personally found this movie very funny, not too many people thought the same way about it. The main reason i didn't see this in theaters was based on the critic and user reviews, it wasn't very well received. After finally watching it, i must say, i am quite confused as to why people didn't give this movie more credit. If you look at the movie for what it is, a buddy-cop comedy, and think about all the things a buddy-cop comedy should do, it does all those things in a pretty funny way. As for problems, one that comes to mind is how most of the music in this movie didn't really seem to fit in the scenes they were in. Other than that this movie doesn't have too many other problems. Just to be clear i am NOT saying this is a flawless movie. But for what it is, it succeeds pretty well and delivers laugh-out-loud moments from end to end. It gives us a more slapstick-ish version of the other buddy-cop comedy ""22 Jump Street"" of the summer and in my opinion is a little underrated and should have a better rating.",Let's Be Cops

152,pedro_xpto10,"Funny Cops, but with Poor Autorithy",6,10 September 2014,"There are extraordinary comedies that make us laugh and cry and which the humorous moments come with the argument of a good story. This is not a movie with a great story, but it's enough to make us laugh. The actors were well chosen and their performance was good, although the film is undemanding. In summary, I liked the movie because many of us have seen in the skin of a policeman and certainly many of us ask ourselves what we would do if we had such authority. But could have been more creative elements and they should have use a little more effects such as explosions, gunfire, etc. Basically the idea was that these fake cops, liked the action but were afraid to shoot.",Let's Be Cops

I assumed it was just going to be another quotable movie where at times you had a good laugh. But because I love both of the two main actors from the show New Girl, I just had to see it. I actually found myself laughing way more than I expected and would love to watch this movie again. Some parts were taken too far but it had a good amount of clean humor and a little crude humor as well. It takes a lot for a comedy to earn itself ten stars. This film did not quite do it because of the scenes that were over the top and probably should have just been left out all together. Don't expect the same laugh out loud comedy like New Girl from Let's Be Cops but it can definitely lift your mood and give you an occasional belly laugh.",Let's Be Cops

To say I'm pretty ignorant of most movies in the last 30 years or so would be an understatement, and I certainly never heard of this one, which was great, because I hate the dreaded PRE-CONCEIVED NOTIONS.
 Thus, when we figured out quickly that the two stars were actually gonna try to be cops, we knew we were in for a fun ride, and we were also 99% positive that the heroes would come out (somewhat) unscathed at the end.
 Main reason this got a ""10"" imho, is because it was a knee-slapping, laugh -out --loud comedy, and mainly, because it was unexpected.
 A final note - Nina Dobrev - wow, what a hottie! With my wife at my side, I had to keep the drooling to a minimum....",Let's Be Cops
159,mathijzzzie,Taste determines your rating of this movie,8,28 September 2014,"When I saw the trailer I was reluctant about seeing this movie. I was afraid it was a standard popular American comedy in which absurdity-comedy was the focus, like most stand-up comedians and Southpark. The movie does include these kind of jokes, but because of the sequence of jokes and the ""story"" (as in standard rom-com ""story"") I found the movie to be very funny. But then again it is difficult to make a movie which everybody thinks is funny, for example I think the Achorman 1 was the most hilarious movie ever but the sequel I thought was terrible. So I think you will either love or hate this movie depending on your sense of humor.",Let's Be Cops
160,blueovation,Very very funny,8,21 September 2014,"Let me just start by saying that this isn't an over the top blockbuster film like everyone seems to expect from every movie that comes out now. For some reason people have these attitudes towards movies that aren't packed with insane plot holes and story details wrapped up in a cgi blanket to attempt to blow your mind. This movie is really a funny movie, no matter what anyone says. My girlfriend was having a bad day and I was low on energy to try to entertain so we went to see this for a few laughs. It didn't disappoint. I didn't go in with high hopes that there would be any real reason to like it very much but it came around within the first few minutes of the movie. We both left feeling better and like it was worth it, (and I am an adult so the 'teenager type jokes' that one reviewer referred to are unfounded). Jake Johnson really sells the image of a guy just looking for any kind of change in his life and Damon Wayans Jr. is and actor that really puts a lot of work into whatever role he is in. I don't want to ruin any of the movie with bits and pieces that I enjoyed more than the others so I am leaving you with this. If you have a desire to get enjoyment from a film without becoming emotionally invested in a story that lasts 3 movies or longer with hints and clues popping up all over the place eluding to a next installment of whatever series, (and enjoy comedy of all types) then I would recommend this highly. Not artistic, not over done, not offensive to the degree some say, just straight up good comedy. Waaay better than the terrible Seth Rogen movie ""the Neighbors"". Hope this helps.",Let's Be Cops

This is not a full movie, it's just a collection of funny ideas (which you can see all of them in the trailer) combined. Everything is ridiculous.

Personally, I prefer movies that aren't probable.. I watched Jim Carrey's 'Dumb and dumber to' couple days ago, and I found it little boring.. The reason is 'because I couldn't savor any freshness.

We're a fan of Buddy-Cop films and also a fan of comedies. However, within the first few minutes, I knew I should have gotten up to get my money back. Overacting on the part of Damon Wayans Jr, an above normal amount of idiocy for a ""realistic"" comedy movie displayed by Jake Johnson, and the cliché bimbo girlfriend (who I'm actually a fan of) was played by Nina Dobrev. The ""action"" scenes were lackluster and the jokes were recycled from older cop comedies. There were a few scenes that I thought were funny, however these were only in comparison the rest of the movie. I'm truly surprised that the director got done filming the entire film and was satisfied with his work. If you're planning on watching this movie, wait for the DVD/Netflix/Hulu version to come out. Do not waste time at the theaters seeing this movie. Do not intentionally pay for this movie. I'd honestly wait for the next Buddy-Cop Movie to come out before watching this movie. If you are seriously wanting to visit the theaters this weekend, opt for an actual action or drama based film. This movie won't even relieve your boredom.",Let's Be Cops

Nowhere in the movie i was bored, it was just so good! The storyline is far from predictable and at times thought-provoking. i have watched it several times and i find new details every time. Paul Rudd is the greatest comedian ever and when you can even make a policeman funny, you are really doing something right.Marlon Wayans delivers a good performance, and i hope he gets nominated for the Oscar.

These actors, Jake Johnson & Damon Wayans Jr. did some fantastic acting. Nina Dobrev did a magnificent work as well, plus she's hot. Rob Riggle was epic in his role as he is known to be.

The two main characters were played by actors I didn't recognize (part of the reason I didn't expect much of the movie), but did a great job of adding to this movies comedy, and I hope to see more of them in the future, especially Damon Wayans Jr..

Although this movie has a low score on various movie reviewing sites I would recommend this movie to most of my friends who are up for a good laugh with quite a few serious moments. The direction was great, the cinematography is great, the ideas behind it are great, the acting is amazing and the comedy will keep you laughing.
