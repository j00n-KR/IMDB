0,Leofwine_draca,Extremely superficial,4,28 November 2014,"LEGION is an extremely superficial CGI-fest and would-be fantasy/horror featuring Paul Bettany as an archangel whose job is to save mankind from an army of supernatural enemies. It's a companion movie to the same director's equally disappointing PRIEST, two films which never seem to break out of a predictable Hollywood B-movie mould.This one's pretty much a single location movie in which a bunch of strangers are holed up in a desert diner and trying to survive against the odds. Bettany underplays it throughout, but he's an acting colossus compared to a rubbishy Dennis Quaid (playing a character who boozes throughout the production) and his equally unmemorable acting companions. The only exception is ALIEN 3's Charles Dutton, whose screen time is all too limited unfortunately.LEGION has plentiful action but none of it is inspiring despite a handful of grisly shock scenes. Instead this seems to be a movie which borrows liberally from the likes of THE PROPHECY, ROSEMARY'S BABY, and at the climax THE TERMINATOR, particularly when Kevin Durand's character comes into it at the end. The most noticeable thing about the movie is the lacklustre quality of the script, complete with insipid dialogue and a lack of realism throughout. Give it a miss.",Legion
1,SnoopyStyle,Simple story with lots of action,5,19 July 2014,God has lost faith in man and he sends his legion of angels to bring on the Apocalypse. Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) comes down to Earth to stop it. Jeep Hanson (Lucas Black) and his father Bob (Dennis Quaid) are taking care of pregnant Charlie (Adrianne Palicki). They work at Paradise Falls diner in the middle of nowhere with Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton). Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson) has come to buy some drugs. Sandra (Kate Walsh) and Howard Anderson (Jon Tenney) are waiting for their car with sexual daughter Audrey (Willa Holland). Communication is cut off from the outside world. The group of strangers must battle all of heaven to save the world.This movie has lots of interesting ideas and visual takes on this world. It's a shoot-em-up horror crossed with a graphic novel. The problem is that it's extremely underwritten. There is nothing to the story and the dialog is unimaginative. Otherwise it has good action and a few good actors. It's a bit of B-action.,Legion
2,claudio_carvalho,"Promising Beginning, Disappointing Conclusion",5,12 June 2010,"God loses the faith in mankind and order the Angel Michael (Paul Bettany) and a legion of angels to bring the Apocalypse on Earth and exterminate the human race. However, Michael rebels against the order and decides to help the humans. Meanwhile in a diner in the middle of nowhere, the owner Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid) runs the place with his son Jeep (Lucas Black), the pregnant waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palacki) and his friend Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton). Their costumers are the Anderson family that is stranded in the place waiting that Jeep fixes their BMW and the lonely Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson) that is lost and wants to make a phone call. When an old woman named Glady Foster (Jeanette Miller) arrives in the diner, she attacks Howard Anderson (Jon Tenney) on the neck with her shark teeth and she is finally killed by Kyle. When a police car arrives in the spot, the stranger Michael advises that Earth is the battleground between angels and humans and Glady was only a vessel possessed by an angel. Further, Charlie's should be born to save the humankind.""Legion"" is a film with a promising beginning and a disappointing conclusion. I really expected to enjoy this film, but the story has many clichés and there is no explanation why the bastard son of Charlie would save the human race. I do not understand how people that can find religious background in a blockbuster action movie. Further, if they have trauma with this theme, why wast their time watching this movie? My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Legião"" (""Legion"")",Legion
3,kosmasp,"""Guilty"" pleasure",7,4 November 2010,"Enjoying this movie might enrage God more than anything that happens in it .. but seriously though (and hopefully you are not offended), this movie is illogical and has quite a few clichés going for it. You might see where it is going (or ""staying"" if you will) and you might not like quite a few reveals or the ending. But the good thing about it is, you can sit back and enjoy it, without having to think about certain story related problems or continuity and other stuff.Of course if you were to use your brain while watching this, one of the things you'd notice, is the fact that Dennis Quaid seems to have a bad choice of movie roles lately. ""Bad"" if you consider what he is capable of and what he ends up playing (this might actually take under 10% of his abilities to pull it off). But then again, you shouldn't care. You also shouldn't care too much about cardboard cut outs presented as ""characters"". But if you do, this is were I warned you. Which is more of a warning then someone else gave before unleashing ... but you know the rest or are about to see the rest.The Prophecy is still the better movie (first one), but for a quick and fun movie, you can always rely on the action on hand here (which is shot very nicely)",Legion
4,jboothmillard,Legion,5,10 September 2016,"There may have a few occasions I thought of the poster for this film, the leading actor with angel wings, and mistook it for the 2011 film Priest, easy mistake, it has a religious sort of format, it is the same leading actor, and the same director, Scott Stewart (Dark Skies), I hoped this would be good. Basically God has lost all faith in mankind, the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) has ordered by the Lord, in addition to a legion of other angels, to bring the Apocalypse to Earth and exterminate the human race. However Michael rebels against his orders, he has fallen to Earth in Los Angeles, and cuts off his wings, he wants to help the humans, he steals a series of automatic weapons and a police car. Meanwhile in a diner in the middle of nowhere in the New Maxico desert, business is running as usual, with owner Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid), his son Jeep (The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift's Lucas Black), his friend and cook Percy Walker (Alien 3's Charles S. Dutton), and pregnant waitress Charlie (Adrianne Palicki). Also present at the diner are single father Kyle Williams (2 Fast 2 Furious's Tyrese Gibson), and married couple Howard (Jon Tenney) and Sandra Anderson (Kate Walsh), with their rebellious teenage daughter Audrey (Willa Holland). Then an elderly woman named Gladys Foster (Jeanette Miller) comes into the diner, acts strangely, telling Charlie her baby is going to ""burn"", and making insults, she then suddenly attacks and crawls on the walls and ceiling like a spider, before being shot. Moments later the sky is darkened by clouds, and the phones and radios are down, the diner and all inhabitants are completely cut off from the outside world, then Michael arrives, he begins handing out guns, explains the situation with God against humanity, and says that Charlie's baby will be the saviour of the world. The diner is now in danger of the impending arrival of many angels, no longer good creatures like humanity assumes, they have taken over the bodies of many innocent civilians, and become rampaging zombie-like creatures, who will do anything to kill them. In the end, after many of the human characters have been killed, and those remaining, including Charlie who has given birth to her child, have escaped the wrath of God, and Michael has confronted Gabriel (Kevin Durand), God has rescinded the order, and Michael returns to Heaven. Also starring Hellboy's Doug Jones as Ice Cream Man, Josh Stamberg as Burton and Yancey Arias as Estevez. Bettany is certainly imposing as the rogue archangel, supporting cast members Quaid and Gibson do well also, it is a simplistic story, an angel coming to save the world and protecting what could be the new messiah, and it does have some good special effects and face-paced battle sequences, overall it is a simple but entertaining enough apocalyptic supernatural action horror film. Worth watching!",Legion
5,Woodyanders,Cool horror/action hybrid,8,3 August 2021,"A motley assortment of folks at a remote rundown roadside diner are forced to fight the forces of evil alongside warrior archangel Michael (a fine and credible performance by Paul Bettany), who must protect the unborn baby of waitress Charlie (an appealing portrayal by Adrianne Palicki) from said forces of evil.Director/co-writer Scott Stewart relates the enjoyable and engrossing off-the-wall story at a snappy pace, makes good use of the dusty'n'desolate desert locations, takes time to develop the characters, ably crafts a creepy and unsettling atmosphere, generates a considerable amount of tension, and stages the exciting action with rip-roaring aplomb.The sound acting by the capable cast keeps this movie humming: Dennis Quaid as crusty skeptic Bob Hanson, Charles S. Dutton as amiable cook Percy Walker, Tyrese Gibson as surly hoodlum Kyle Williams, Lucas Black as smitten decent dude Jeep, Kevin Durand as lethal and dutiful rival angel Gabriel, Willa Holland as brash teen Audrey, Kate Walsh as the prissy Sandra, and Jon Tenney as uptight yuppie Howard. Moreover, there are neat cameos from Jeanette Miller as sweet, but sinister little old lady Gladys Foster and Doug Jones as a possessed ice cream man. The fact that the basic plot plays like a crazy religious version of The Terminator only adds to the infectiously loopy fun. A super nifty flick.",Legion

7,paul_haakonsen,Not everyone can play the hero!,5,22 February 2010,"This movie is a semi-interesting experience in my opinion.Sure the movie had really nice effects and some cool scenes. But the story was watered-down and half-hearted. And the ending? Well, I will not give it away here, but wow, can it get any more sappy Hollywood-ish?Three things puzzled me about the movie. First, the angels were dressed in black and were all somber and gloomy, and carried some really nasty weaponry. Well, if those are the servants of God, then the Almighty Lord is not as benevolent and forgiving as the Bible would have us believe (and I am not just saying that because I don't believe in God). Secondly, an infant born without an umbilical cord? Hmmm, interesting. And thirdly, why do all wicked/evil people just have to listen to metal?Anyway, the cast was good, and the acting performances good. Bringing some sense of enjoyment to the movie. The sets and props were nice as well, very detailed. And there was a constant momentum to the movie, it never became stagnant or boring, so you were never losing interest.I watched it for the entertainment of it, not caring about the Biblical aspect, and I think the best experience is obtained by forgetting about the Bible and what you know about Christianity. Just watch the movie for what it is, A MOVIE!""Legion"" failed to punch through in a memorable way, for me at least, but it did provide me with entertainment throughout the entire feature. Though it doesn't have enough entertainment value for a second watching at a later time.",Legion
8,Coventry,Sarah Connor?,5,19 October 2010,"Just in case you're interested in seeing a catholic version of James Cameron's Sci-Fi milestone ""The Terminator"", ""Legion"" is the ideal film for you! It's not a bad movie, honestly, but it's unbelievably derivative and unoriginal. Basically, you can just take ""The Terminator"" and replace some of the pivot Sci-Fi elements with biblical prophecies. Instead of intelligent machines taking over and generating the apocalypse, it now is God himself who decides to pull the plug on his earthly creation. Sarah Connor is named Charlie this time around. Instead of the future leader of the resistance, she's reluctantly carrying in her womb the little new Jesus. Rather than a mechanical Arnold Schwarzenegger from the future, God sends down beefcake angel Gabriel and, rather than the volunteering resistance fighter Kyle Reese, he battles the fallen angel Michael who turned his back to God's plans. Okay, you could righteously claim that numerous movies are imitations of ""The Terminator"" and/or other cinematic classics, but ""Legion"" almost specifically copies certain sequences, like the very last shot of the film in which Adrianne Palicki's character Charlie looks almost identical to Linda Hamilton's legendary Sarah Connor. But enough complaining and splitting heirs, as I would definitely want to insist that ""Legion"" contains an enormous B-movie popcorn entertainment value. There's the good old-fashioned isolated setting of a ramshackle diner in the middle of a desert, where mobile phones naturally don't have any signals and only traveling strangers accidentally end up with engine trouble, and a whole lot of stereotypical characters (like the bickering couple, the war veteran, the rebellious teenager and failed father). There are also a few massively amusing scenes, most notably the one where an old lady suddenly transforming into a vicious demon and one featuring a possessed ice cream salesman. The make-up effects and stunts are nicely cheesy and the film is constantly fast-paced. Also, and perhaps even most importantly, none of the people involved acts or behaves overly pretentious. The subject matter of the film might be considered preposterous, but to me it seemed that at least everyone in front and behind the cameras interpreted it as a rather insignificant but fun crowd-pleaser.",Legion

10,Scarecrow-88,Legion,4,20 November 2010,"A rock solid cast helps matters in this silly, murky religious action supernatural horror flick about the Lord's decision to destroy mankind, humanity's only hope possibly resides in the birth of a child angel Gabriel is to kill. Michael, the archangel, ""clips his wings"" and believes mankind deserves the benefit of the doubt despite the fact that we as a human race have squandered our lives, deserving to be eradicated from the earth. So now human Michael will assist in protecting the pregnant woman, holed up with other various people from all walks of life in a diner, as God sends his angel army to possess weak human vessels converging on Paradise Falls(appropriate title, eh?), their mission to stop the birth of the baby. The excellent cast included Dennis Quaid, the underrated Lucas Black, the superb Charles S Dutton, Tyrese Gibson, Kate Walsh(Private Practice; rather wasted to tell you the truth), Adrianne Palicki(as the pregnant woman carrying the baby), John Tenney(as Walsh's husband whose fate is rather gross), Willa Holland(as Tenney and Walsh's daughter, scantily clad, who was the one responsible for her parents predicament to start with, redeeming herself at the end), and Paul Bettany(as Michael, pretty much a superhero packing machine guns and martial arts as he mows down humans possessed by angels with shark teeth and ferocious temperament). Jeanette Miller has a memorable scene as a profane grandma(since when does an angel sent by God curse like a sailor?)who crawls up walls and bites a plug out of a victim's neck. Kevin Durand is Gabriel, sent by our Divine Creator to take Michael's place as an angelic abortionist. Doug Jones is the Ice Cream Man whose limbs stretch turning him into a four-legged human insect. Cameron Harlow is the boy who appears to be surrounded by the angelic creatures, doomed to die, only for one of our heroes to be fooled, suffering for his bravado. Dutton has a wonderful scene with Tyrese about a childhood memory with his father regarding the importance of making the most out of life. Quaid and Black make for a realistic father and son and have some nice scenes together. The combat between Gabriel and Michael at the end is hard to see because it's so damn dark(Gabriel is equipped with some sort of hammer with blades that protrude out and metallic wings). The underlying message seems to speak about not giving up on mankind just because we are so f#cked up, in need of saving..you know, how we should savor the lives we have and not take them for granted.",Legion
11,LeonLouisRicci,"A Good (""Comic"") Book Story",6,4 November 2012,"When will Hollywood stop putting ""wings"" on Angels? First they look ridiculous, and second Angels don't have ""wings"", they are a metaphor for flight. An artistic interpretation, and every time they start flapping about in a movie it just loses all sense of sensibility.That said, if you can get over that indulgence, this is one of those little movies that takes on a big theme and is left less than adequate. It is a confined siege in a diner that leaves the fate of mankind in the hands of a newborn and some willing participants that have varying degrees of faith.The concept is not without relevance or in need of telling, it is just a shame that it is reduced to trendy zombified slaughter and other sideshow hocus pocus. This is not without entertainment value and one needs to exempt the pretensions of a metaphysical mindset and belief in the ""Good Book"" to enjoy this within the constraints of the ""Comic-Book"" sensibilities that it inhabits and go along with it for the Fairy Tale elements and forget taking this as some sort of Revelation.",Legion
12,dbborroughs,I should have waited for cable,5,9 February 2010,"Paul Bettany stars as the angel Michael who comes to earth to stand against the angelic order who has been sent to earth to wipe out mankind and stop the birth of a new messiah.A late night dash to the theater was rewarded with a rather run of the mill film. The plot and such is the sort of thing that has been done before any number of times before. Its not bad, its just the sort of thing that made me wonder what in the hell I was doing sitting in a theater at 1030 at night when I could be home asleep. We'll not get into the logic holes since the sense of deja vu was so over powering it took away any real suspense. The cast which includes Dennis Quaid and Charles Dutton is quite good and no doubt helped it get a theatrical release. You've seen this before so just wait for cable.",Legion
13,zardoz-13,A High-octane Apocalyptic Actioneer!,8,24 January 2010,"Freshman director Scott Stewart's high-octane apocalyptic actioneer ""Legion"" suffers minutely from one contrivance after another, but this suspenseful secular saga conjures up more than enough thrills, chills and spills to keep audiences entertained with its audacity. A desolate roadside diner in a sprawl of hills in the middle of nowhere serves as the setting for an end-game showdown between mankind and its Maker. Gladiatorial archangels, demonic humans with a cannibalistic lust for flesh, a mammoth insect swarms and other ominous symbols of Revelation appear in this old school, souped-up, R-rated, gunfire meets fantasy smörgåsbord. The self-sacrificing Archangel Michael slices off his own wings for the occasion and opposes a dutiful Gabriel to protect an unborn child and preserve humanity from utter extinction. According to our winged wonder, God wants to grease humanity for the second time. Basically, the Supreme Being can no longer tolerate our B.S. Mind you, this is a sanitized paraphrasing of the profane problem. Like the Egyptians in the Old Testament, God dispatches plagues, demons, and cannibals to polish off mankind. Non-religious audiences will crave the noisy battle scenes with their fusillades of gun-fire. Most of the violence staged outside against the aggressors resembles a first-person shooter video game. The adversaries hurl themselves futilely against the good guys in a hopeless frontal assault. Often, during lulls in the attacks as our appealing and clearly sympathetic characters let their guns cool off, they discuss philosophical and moral issues. Nevertheless, ""Legion"" illustrates the dictum that the meek shall inherit the earth. Stewart and his scenarist Peter Schink refrain from proselytizing.""Legion"" opens with an unmistakable homage to James Cameron's sci-fi classic ""The Terminator."" Archangel Michael falls mysteriously from the night skies and lands in a dark back alley with blood on his face. He whips out a savage-looking knife, cuts off his wings, later sews the wounds shut, stocks up with an arsenal of lethal hardware, tangles with the L.A.P.D., and careens off in their cruiser. Meanwhile, the action shifts to the Paradise Falls Diner where the usual gallery of customers and employees huddle, among them the hard-bitten owner Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid of ""Pandorum""), his simple-minded but conscientious mechanic son Jeep (Lucas Black of ""Sling Blade""), gruff but friendly short-order cook Percy Walker (Charles S. Dutton of ""Alien 3""), an affluent couple, Sandra (Kate Walsh of ""Bewitched"") and Howard (Jon Tenney of ""The Stepfather""), whose BMW has broken down, their defiant teen daughter Audrey (Willa Holland of ""Garden Party"") and an enigmatic, pistol-packing African-American, Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson of ""Death Race"") who is caught up in a child custody quarrel. The most important character in ""Paradise Falls"" is a pretty, young waitress with the morals of an ally cat, Charlie (Adrianne Palicki of ""Seven Mummies""), who has gotten herself in the family way. Ironically, she had toyed with the idea of abortion, but now only wants to hand her child off to a good family. Bob Hanson knows something about defeat. He opened a diner in the worst place in the world and hoped that a shopping mall would take root nearby. The mall took root but not nearby, so Bob's roadside restaurant Paradise Falls, (talk about theme!), never became the pot of gold that he had envisaged when he dreamed about opening it. His wife left him to raise son and Bob doesn't want Jeep to waste his time with Charlie.Unlike God, Michael has never lost his faith in mankind. He has come to defend Charlie and her unborn baby. He brings the firepower that he looted from a warehouse and arms Percy, Kyle, Charlie, and the others some pretty, heavy-duty hardware in the form of assault weapons. Initially, Michael has been assigned to slay the baby. When he confronts Gabriel, they have an argument about obedience. The obsequious Gabriel wants nothing more than to do the Lord's work, while Michael prefers to be insubordinate. Director Scott Stewart stages everything like a Rob Zombie showdown movie. Happily, Stewart and ""Gotham Café"" co-scripter Peter Schink never take themselves or the storyline seriously. The first time that we meet Bob Hanson, he is slapping around a television monitor, trying to get a decent signal. The old black & white movie that is being broadcast is the James Stewart classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and the scene where an angel, Clarence, informs Stewart that he is an angel who is trying to earn his wings. This foreshadowing of Michael and his wingless arrival is appropriately tongue-in-cheek. The first demon that enters the diner is an elderly ""Golden Girl"" type named Gladys Foster (Jeanette Miller of ""The Truman Show"") who uses a wheeled walker. The ""Legion"" trailer shows her warning Charlie that the waitress' baby will burn. Gladys turns demonic after acting so sweet to everybody, rips a hole in Howard's neck, scuttles across the ceiling like a human fly, and recovers after momentarily being stunned by a flying frying pan.No, ""Legion"" doesn't qualify as scriptural, despite its Bible-themed message of redemption. This energetic epic not only serves as an anti-abortion tract but also as anti-cigarette propaganda. This movie reminded me of those larger-than-life Arnold Schwarzenegger science fiction sagas from the 1980s. Everything about ""Legion"" is gloriously low-tech, even down to the hardware. When Gabriel and Michael tangle, the former wields a multi-purpose mace while the latter brandishes a shotgun. The drawback here is that neither really die because they are immortal so suspense takes a hit. The performances are uniformly excellent, and the cast maintains a straight face through this riotous nonsense. Paul Bettany excels as Michael and Kevin Durand stands out as Gabriel. Lenser John Lindley, whose credits include ""The Serpent and the Rainbow,"" ""Field of Dreams,"" and ""Pleasantville,"" generates considerable tension and suspense with his darkly-lighted cinematography. The surprise ending and the changes that Jeep and Charlie experience along with the adrenalin-fueled shoot-out sequences make ""Legion"" into entertaining hokum.",Legion

16,neil-476,Ripe Tripe,6,11 March 2010,"First of all, don't bother seeing this film if you want anything remotely resembling exposition, explanation or conventional narrative building blocks, because such things simply aren't there. It turns out mankind has given God the hump (no reason given) so he has decided to wipe out mankind only instead of a flood, he's using angels. Except, presumably because of budget cutbacks in heaven - due to the recession, I imagine - the promised Legion turns out to be two, one of whom has switched to the other side (you do get a longshot of a Legion of angels, although the image turns out to be worryingly similar to a cloud of flies which, itself, turns out to be not quite the plot point you thought it was going to be). So Armageddon comes via ordinary people, turned to do God's dark business in various scary and violent ways. Our turncoat angel, Michael, has determined (how?) that mankind's salvation lies in the unborn child of a waitress in a tatty old diner in the desert (obvious really), as a result of which a ragtag bag of assorted diners and staff face the assembled might of heaven, as delegated to possessed humans.I have a feeling that this one may not go down that well with anyone who feels strongly that the conventional view of the Christian God is based on He is a loving God - in this movie, His minions adopt a policy of biting chunks out of people's necks, or exploding folk in upside-down crucifixions, and it appears fairly clear that He has personally sent His angels on a mission to murder this baby.I also felt that the whole thing was assembled on the basis of what would look good on screen with no other criterion in mind - otherwise, for instance, the notion of God's omnipotence might have raised its head, as a result of which the film would have been very much shorter (""I'm omnipotent - surely I must be able to do something about half a dozen people holed up in a clapboard shack with automatic weapons!"") To be perfectly frank, this is codswallop of the ripest variety but, for all that, there is something quite entertaining in watching a decent actor like Paul Bettany giving full commitment to something as preposterous as this. Kevin Durand, as Gabriel, is excellent and brings some depth to an underwritten, one-note role. Dennis Quaid also appears.There were some enjoyable moments (all the better ones spoiled in the trailer) - the ceiling-scuttling little old lady, the ice-cream van spiderleg man, the angelic bait-boy, and Gabriel's horn.But this was trash cinema, to be enjoyed only if all critical faculties had been set to ""Off"" beforehand.Added note on re-watching 18 months later: Adrianne Palicki's dialogue is often completely incomprehensible.",Legion
17,anaconda-40658,Legion of Crap!,2,30 April 2015,"Legion (2010): Dir: Scott Stewart / Cast: Paul Bettany, Lucas Black, Dennis Quaid, Tyrese Gibson, Adrianne Palicki: Legion means many and there are many reasons to laugh at this Biblical mockery. Characters are given decent backgrounds but never followed up upon. A legion of angels attacks earth after God supposedly loses faith in mankind. Archangel Michael arrives with a carload of machine guns to protect a small group at a diner before locking into a ridiculous battle against angel Gabriel. Any Bible scholars will note that God did this with a flood in the Old Testament. Paul Bettany plays Michael with false bravo. The moment he appears with big guns in either hand, the audience response with laughter. Lucas Black plays a mechanic whose girlfriend's unborn child is the key to mankind's survival. Yeah, and in the Bible her name is Mary and the child would be named Jesus. That story is far more interesting than the idiocy compounded here. Dennis Quaid plays the stern diner owner who spends much time preaching to Lucas about his failed marriage, and slapping the TV when it gets static. Tyrese Gibson arrives with a hand gun but this is only remotely touched upon. He will engage in gun play with the so-called immortals. Adrianne Palicki plays the pregnant waitress who is suppose to be the key to everything but nothing elevates beyond the level of stupidity. This film is about as frightening as an episode of Touched By an Angel. Director Scott Stewart delivers on action, and the special effects are innovative with people shape shifting but it ultimately becomes a legion of extreme bullshit. Score: 2 / 10",Legion
18,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Solid, if slightly flawed effort",9,13 April 2017,"While gathered at a remote truck-stop diner, a small group of inhabitants finds that the mysterious stranger who arrives is an Angel of Heaven looking to keep a pregnant member of the group alive as God sends forth an army to wipe them out as part of his Armageddon plans.Overall this one was quite an enjoyable effort. The biggest factor for this one is the fact that this one really lets loose with lots of great action throughout here, giving this one so much to really like here from the numerous encounters. There's tons of bloodshed and some creepy moments here and there from scenes like the first shootout from the armory with the turned policemen, the diners' encounter with the old woman who begins flying around the ceiling attempting to get at them in the middle of a huge gunfight and the blazing firefight on the top of the establishment with the endless stream of possessed coming along in cars leading to the flaming crashes and burning bodies left behind as the gunfights take out dozens more in fine fashion. The other ambushes on the patrons inside the diner are quite fun as they attempt to break in and get at them forcing some thrilling action to barricade them off which makes the whole segment quite fun along with the later attacks here with the trap involving the family coming to the gas pump and setting off the trap which is quite a blast overall here. The big final assault here makes for quite a big spectacle here as the initial charge on the building and the pre-natal conflict to keep the baby alive in the midst of a furious hand-to-hand battle between the supernaturally-powered aggressors throwing each other around the diner and brawling with intensity and fervor that matches the brutality of what's coming on. The spiritual context of the fight helps to give this a stronger sense of fantasy and spectacle than otherwise expected, which gives this one a great visual sense to go along with the engaging story which gives this another piece of the strong plot. As well, the fact that there's a lot to like with its make-up work on the possessed deformities and the strong, bloody gore all work together with these factors here to make this a rather enjoyable effort. There's not a whole lot really wrong here, as there's really only one main problem here as there's some truly bad and obvious CGI found here. The transitions from the possessed as they begin jumping and flying around in really ludicrous manners that are tacky and stand-out in the diner attacks and the finale which are the most obvious and distracting parts. Otherwise, there wasn't a lot of other flaws here.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, violence-against- children, drug use and strong religious themes.",Legion
19,gradyharp,And big name stars bought into THIS?,2,28 May 2010,"LEGION attracts the viewer because of the cover of the DVD: would Paul Bettany, looking very buff as a cross between evil dark gear under the glow of divine light, betray his fans by making a bad picture? Well, yes. And so is the case for Dennis Quaid, Charles S. Dutton, Tyrese Gibson, etc. perhaps there just aren't many scripts form which to choose that draws actors of this quality into a unintentionally comical dud. But here we are with over two hours of nonsense that may have at its core a good idea but escaped the borders of good taste and character/story development. Scott Stewart wrote (with Peter Schwink - neither with impressive credentials except for 'unlisted special effects' work in prior works) and directed this plodding CGI mess and even Paul Bettany can't save it. Going on the prediction that 'when the last angel falls, the fight for mankind begins', Paul Bettany as Michael falls to the earth in Los Angeles, cuts off his black wings, kills a couple of sadistic cops, and steals their vehicle to drive to the desert (apparently in Arizona) where dwells a grumpy Dad (Dennis Quaid) and his son Jeep (Lucas Black) in a little trailer hut cum diner/truck stop. The reason for the destination is that here lives the very pregnant tacky unmarried young girl Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), cared for by Jeep, who is apparently carrying the infant that will save the world after Armageddon: Percy the cook (Charles S. Dutton) just looks on. Michael arrives, a lost man (Tyrese Gibson) with a past seeks information about his destination, a cranky couple with daughter (Willa Holland, Jon Tenney, Kate Walsh) complains about everything and the delay in their car repair by Jeep, and Jeep yearns (it's hard to tell his emotions since his acting ability is minimal) to care for the reluctant Charlie. Out of a flock of flies and other insects come a crazy possessed old lady (Jeanette Miller) who climbs the ceiling, an ice cream man (Doug Jones) who morphs into a silly CGI creation, and a whole flock of displaced persons who are driven by the need to kill the baby in Charlie's womb. The rest of the 'story' is pure CGI stuff which becomes almost intolerably boring. With all of the fascination with the approaching prediction of the end of the world in 2012 it is understandable that everyone wants to jump on board a popular topic. Hopefully a sensitive version will come along, one that makes us think instead of cringe. Grady Harp",Legion
20,trashgang,cash-in on Clash Of The Titans,4,15 March 2011,"You could expect it, once they were talking about doing a remake of Clash Of The Titans (1981) that others would make their own version of fallen angels and Gods. this here is one of those. There are some good parts in it, for me the part with the old lady really worked out fine as did the weirdo getting out of the car and changing is some creature. But in other parts there was a bit too much of blah blah were nothing really happened. That teared this flick down for me. It's never gory or even scary, the only disgusting scene is when someone is hanging upside down on a cross and things go wrong with his body. The story about the angel and the fallen one was a bit boring. It's strange, I have the comic of Legion and that's better than this flick. Not really my cup of tea.",Legion
21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Legion,6,21 January 2010,"The trailer had me thinking that this would be one heck of a slice and dice fest in the same vein as Feast or even The Mist, with a group of rag tag survivors being huddled together in a diner / supermarket, and the fight for survival against invading monsters of all shapes, sizes and surprises. The latter film also had a bible-thumper, and religion forms the basis of the premise here, when you see how it all becomes a modern day re-imagining of the tale of Mary, Joseph, and the prophetic messiah baby.That's just my angle at making sense of the flimsy plot which didn't develop properly, despite ample time in the first half that had characters talking, rationalizing and reflecting on just what their predicament is, and how senseless it all seemed, at the expense of action sequences that undeniably got better as the film wore on. Amongst the action offered that I've not seen before involved the angel Gabriel (last done androgynously by Tilda Swinton in Constantine), which brings to mind just how angels would be clad for battle, with armour, close combat weapon with frills, and those metallic wings used both defensively and offensively in quite elegant ways as shield and blade combined in one sweeping motion. Not to forget, flight too.Unfortunaately there are a number of close references to other films, most notably the Terminator movies and the Matrix combined for certain scenes that looked way too familiar. The beginning already had Terminator like arrival of the angel Michael (Paul Bettany) to our world, earmarked for destruction by God because he was losing faith in the bullshit of mankind. He's not following his book of Revelations though, as he sends his angelic force to earth mimicking how Terminator robots get sent back in time. Or the severe warping of the human face to indicate possession by a higher, in this case, spiritual force.Basically, the world is God's matrix, and the angels being his agents sent to stop and destroy the birth of the prophetic Neo, who is but an unborn child in Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), an unwed mom who's waitressing at a diner out of nowhere aptly titled Paradise Falls, run by the estranged father and son team of Bob (Dennis Quaid) and Jeep Hanson (Lucas Black from Fast and Furious 3), who get thrown into the thick of the action together with the rest of their diner crew and customers, which can be easily read as fodder for the apocalypse, which came in the form of a spider granny, ice cream man and the likes.For the film to work, you have to buy into its reasoning that God has decided to end the world through an unfair battle using his angels against humans, and the absence of the Devil whom a friend thought would actually either rejoice, or would have gathered new followers with the exodus of human souls now being abandoned by the holy one. If you don't subscribe to this premise, then everything will not hold water, and it'll become just another mindless action flick that flits from one sequence to another. And let me know if you don't agree that the baby is the messiah (if I wanted to go one step further it could even be the second coming), since every angel bowed their heads in reverence, and stopped dead in their tracks. It wasn't explained why the baby held the key to the salvation of mankind, so that's my speculation. After all, Michael the angel did find it worthwhile to switch sides in order to find some glimmer of hope amongst mankind to change his master's mind.Legion had an interesting potential but ultimately got let down by its half-baked plot development and references so close you'd think it was The Matrix or The Terminator. It got played out too seriously for its good, though with room given for a sequel if one ever gets made given the way it ended (really like The Terminator again), and this time maybe with room to deal with the demons now that angels are likely out of the way.",Legion
22,siderite,A bunch of clichés all glued together with some CGI,6,27 June 2010,"It was a lot of fun watching this movie, mostly because it was so predictable and bad. I predicted every scene, every death and the way it is going to happen, every jump scare and every dialog. Actually, if I think about it, I could have told you what the movie was going to be like after watching the trailer and thinking about it a bit.I can honestly say that the only scene that evoked any kind of feeling other than amusement was the dialog between the angels Michael and Gabriel, where Kevin Durand, best known for cardboard characters in all kinds of sci-fi movies and series, displayed something that was akin to emotional range. It just jumped at me because he was the last I would have expected it from, when playing in a movie with Dennis Quaid, Paul Bettany and Lucas Black, but really... if I have to choose, he was the best actor all around, the others could have just as well been computer generated characters (and I mean their personality here).Bottom line: no wonder the world is turning the way it is when God throws random acts of pointless rage and the angels are incompetent even when acting like demons.

Archangel Michael is among them - but he has a change of heart because he still has faith in humanity. Michael disobeys God's orders to kill - including Charlie's unborn child - and instead protects her and the baby. Charlie's child is to become a savoir to mankind.What I didn't like about the film - was a new ""savior"" for humanity. That part just got on my nerves a bit because that goes against the Christian teachings. I also didn't like the angels acting and looking too much like demons - that part is just over the top.I like the film to a degree - it's interesting to watch.

24,KineticSeoul,Way worse than the trailer,3,12 April 2010,"This movie bored the hell out of me, I usually don't complain about a film's budget but for a film like this it really needed it. They didn't even have the budget for having a bunch of angels on the screen so they changed it to zombies instead, well there bodies got taken over by angels or so it says in the movies but they act like zombies. Plus this film has got to have on the worst dialogue I have ever heard, not only is it very cheesy it's cringe worthy bad. And for a movie about the apocalypse the almost the whole film takes place at a restaurant. You can tell by the actors and actresses that no one even tried and knew this film was going to be a piece of crap, especially Dennis Quaid who was probably just in it for the paycheck. And the film also has a lot of plot holes, this movie sucked plain and simple. I am actually surprised it actually made it into theaters instead of going straight to DVD.

Most times, I hated a movie at first, and after more and more thought, I find that I was too harsh. In this case, we have actual angels of Heaven above that use their metal wings for shields and actually get hurt withbullets. HmmmThis movie, Legion, is so much too like many other movies: The Seventh Sign, The Mist, Michael, Dawn of the Dead, I Am Legend and even Terminator 2: Judgment Day. It's a Trapped-Survivor film, whereas, a group of clichéd ""heroes"" must band together for the unknown, scary and unrealistic monsters outside. SEE: Night of the Living Dead (or any of the Dead series) or Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight.So, now, we've established this movie is NOT original. Do they bring anything to the table? Well, sorta. We have a choose-to-be-fallen angel who fell because God wanted: Noah's Ark II: Baby Got Back. Apparently, He's upset because mankind's, well, you know how bad we are, and he wants to send zombies and flies, yes, flies to wipe us out.Thankfully, a group of men and women – all with their fantastic (no, I'm joking) backgrounds - hold up with a know-it-all Michael, the aforementioned dropped angel, who happens to have a large number of guns, unlimited ammo and Biblical knowledge to predict the bad/good angels from their attack and to save an unborn child who supposedly supposed to save ALL MANKIND.Incredibly, this ""Good-VS-Evil"" tale involves gun-toting angels and never really dives into why the baby is the key to proving God wrong. Let's stop there. Who the bleepy-bleep can prove God wrong? Let's go further back: even if you don't believe in God, but you know what kind of being He is, do you really believe an action of an ex-angel and a single mother can make God wake up and say: ""Oops, My bad. Sorry, let me call off my rage""?It starts off good, improves with the presence of both a mean ceiling-crossing granny and Dennis Quaid – though that's his weakest performance/character to date and then progressively gets worse. There is nothing original or redeeming here. Just plain skip it. Read the Bible. At least that ""Good Book"" doesn't contain all those incredibly fake JAW DROPPING creatures.

26,Robert_duder,"Pure entertainment and nothing more...no religion, no message, no intellectual properties",7,6 February 2010,"This is going to be a tough review to write. The reason I say that is because Legion for all intents and purposes is not a good film. Its ridiculous, preposterous, with plot holes the size of cannon balls. You could pick this film apart until there was nothing left of it but angel wings and dirt. So here is the thing. Legion was incredibly entertaining! The action was wicked and intense, the characters were fun and intriguing, it was gory and action packed so despite everything else I had fun. You basically have to let go of everything to go into this film. And some people can do that because a movie is not always art, or full of message and morality, a film can also just be absolutely nothing but entertain and for me Legion did exactly that. Upon retrospect of the film you'll start to realize the startling amount of errors and plot holes but I think a movie should be reviewed mostly on its first impression like when you're sitting in the theater. The unfortunate side to the film is that it misses the incredible potential of this epic good vs evil battle by making the story rather convoluted and underusing the characters of Michael and Gabriel.Paul Bettany is a great actor and very versatile. I think the film makers of Legion were lucky to have him. He is brooding, and strong and commanding as the rogue angel Michael. Even being a leading character they underuse him and we really don't get to see enough of his action. Lucas Black is naive and simple Jeep Hanson. In a normal film he would likely become the hero but when you've got an Angel to contend with you take a backseat and unfortunately that is where his performance is pushed to. He does well but is overshadowed in a big from the other actors in the film. That includes Dennis Quaid as Black's father. I love Quaid and this is no exception. Its a small role but he takes it and makes it his own and really commands the screen. Adrianne Palicki is the lead female who is basically the cause of this angelic war. Palicki is very underused because I think she could have given a really strong performance if she had been given the chance but like Black she takes a back seat. The cast is also boosted by some amazing supporting performances by Charles S. Dutton and Kevin Durand who should have also been used more. Also worth mentioning is solid supporting roles from Kate Walsh, Jon Tenney, and Willa Holland.Some might also go into this movie figuring it to be an epic battle between good and evil, Angels and Demons, further proved by the name of film, Legion being a horde of demons that possess someone in the bible. Instead this is about a battle from Heaven between Angels not even fallen Angels. The special effects are solid and even breath taking at times. The film also reeks of being Stephen King-esquire which in my opinion is one of the highest compliments. King could have put this together much much better but it has the twisted religious overtones, the isolation of a desert gas bar, and even the vivid characters. So for all of you that love to be simply entertained and want a thriller, action, even part horror film then absolutely treat yourself to Legion and avoid trying to pick it apart. It's a solid action trick. 7.5/10",Legion
27,bowmanblue,Such a guilty pleasure flick,7,3 September 2018,"If you were to ask me, 'Is Legion a good film?' I would have to reply a resounding 'No.' However, that flies (like an angel?) in the face of the fact that I originally hired it, then bought it on DVD and have subsequently watched it a few times since. What can I say... I clearly have little taste in films! Sometimes you don't want DeNiro's excellent acting ability, or Christopher Nolan's tales of head-scratching, mind-bending concepts. You'll even forfeit decent dialogue and little character development for simple shooting monsters with big guns. And this is what you get right here.Basically, God himself is disillusioned with the human race and decides it's time to get rid of them (and kill a baby while he's at it). However, God's top angel (played by Paul Bettany) says 'No way!' and decides to save this special child and, while he's at it, all of us mortals. Now, if this sounds like a feat that couldn't possibly be crammed into just an hour and a half, it all takes place in a restaurant by a freeway in the middle of the desert. Our - sort of - winged hero has to help a band of human survivors fend off wave after wave of (fallen?) angels until the child is born.It's basically a 'siege' movie. Think 'Assault on Precinct 13' but with monsters attacking those held up in a small, barricaded dwelling. There's nothing more grandiose than that, so if that's the sort of low-brow film you want to watch at the end of a long day's work then you should get what you're looking for. There's plenty of action and shoot-outs and for what it is it's not bad. Just don't go expecting anything too deep and dramatic and you won't be disappointed. Oh and Dennis Quaid is also in it - he tries to act his best with the script he's been given and occasionally comes close to succeeding. But then another battle comes along and you end up losing another extra in a hideous way possible.It's not amazing, but then I don't think it ever tries to be.

Michael, one of the angels, thinks God is wrong and in order to save humanity, he goes to this small diner in the desert in order to protect an unborn child. He says the child is the key to save humanity; however, no further details are given. More should have been said about the baby and why he was so important. So, the people trapped in this diner must keep the angles out. The angels take over human bodies in order to attack, so they are easily killed. That part made little sense, if you have supernatural powers, why not use them. Gabriel, another angel. fights Michael and wins, but Michael comes back again. I didn't get that unless God decided Michael was right and that humans deserved another chance.

It stumbled a bit in the last block, but for the most part I enjoyed this puppy. In all honesty Legion's absurd storyline of having angels creating havoc in the real world was quite refreshing and unique, while managing to keep me on my toes. Most of the characters in this movie were likable and were easy to sympathize with, while Paul Bettany made for a great anti-hero. Tyrese Gibson's character was probably my favorite though, it's a shame we didn't get to explore his character more. The fight in the finale between Gabriel|Kevin Durand| and Michael|Bettany| was quite impressive and brought quite a bit of excitement to me, I have to say. The only major complaints I have for this movie are that it seemed rather rushed for time, and the character development could have been a lot more improved with a little more depth and effort injected into them. Aside from a few blunders, I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, much more than I thought I would.Performances. Paul Bettany makes a great anti-hero that's not only likable, but somewhat bad ass in a way, considering his character. Lucas Black is decent as the lead heroine. He gave a sympathetic show for the most part, but he had his bland moments. Tyrese Gibson's character was quiet, with a no-nonsense approach. It's a shame they didn't explore it more. Adrianne Palicki is good as the pregnant, yet vulnerable love interest of Black's. Kevin Durand is good as Gabriel, quite intense too. Dennis Quiad usually delivers, and here was no different. His drunken, yet likable show was often a highlight. Charles S. Dutton has a small role, but he injected likability into it.Bottom line. It's far from perfect, but it entertained the heck out of me.

34,ironhorse_iv,Legion is god awful.,4,10 January 2014,"I'm sorry, but this movie is just angelic stupid. Directed & co-written by Scott Stewart, this movie could had been a really clever smart movie. It could have been an interesting commentary on religion in the hands of a skilled writer, but sadly it is essentially just a lousy zombie movie. Legion is 1984's Terminator with 1995's Neon Genesis Evangelion's interpretation on the end times by way of a 2004's Dawn of the Dead zombie apocalypse. Still, this movie might offended many Christians with its harsh subject matter and its portrayal of God as a fire and brimstone creator, than the compassionate and ever loving being. It seems like the whole purpose of the film was to just vilify God and Christianity. I know about the stories of the bible, such as God casually murdering thousands in Egypt with the plague, killing people with the flood in Noah's tale, and end of Sodom & Gomorrah as examples. I do know the stories of Revelations. I mean, if they're going to use God from the Bible, they should be consistent and not create some convoluted, illogical movie from it. The movie find itself, dumbing off the epic concept into the simplest action version it can make. The movie was focus to have fast-moving angels descending from a dark sky, attacking cities, but we don't actually see that. Instead, the film opens up with people at a diner in the middle of nowhere desert trying to fight against swarms of possession cartoony people such as evil Ice Cream truck driver and Linda Blair type grandma. This was supposed to be a nearly 3 hour long epic tale of Earth Vs Heaven, but the movie had to be cut due to funding to 100 minutes of action surrounding a diner. So, the movie end up with really poor editing. I know the movie takes artistic license, but I don't like how the way, it went. If God really wanted to end the world, he would've been more efficient about it. If God is all powerful and all knowing, God apparently has poor time management skills seeing as God wait mere hours before the woman Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) gave birth to the savior, he is trying to kill. Couldn't he just snap his fingers and burn the earth? Or just kill every person on the planet with a single thought? This is God we're talking about, everything and anything whenever he wants. If the baby is born, God's plan will be ruined, so why is God allowing these events to happen? The newborn baby is supposedly here to save the human race. It seems like God in this film is a bi-polar manic, who doesn't know if he wants to save humanity or destroy it. The movie has that 'Job' full of flaws logic. The movie was very interesting, if you are interested in Angelic Lore or Apocalyptic Books of the Bible, this movie serves as an odd interpretation, but almost satirical. The construction was definitely not well build. While, the movie has fine actors, the characters are one-dimension as they come. The Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) is more like a rip-off of the Kyle character from the Terminator movie. No, really. Does This Remind You of Anything?: Two men appear; one is here to protect a waitress whose child will save the world, and one is here to destroy said waitress to prevent said child from being born. Why does Michael need cut his wings off, anyways? I know, it's supposed to bring him back to normal, or put him as a fallen angel, but gees you would think, he keep it on, so the diner people would believe him better if he had immortal angel than a normal odd bloke. Depending on what belief, this movie is based on, Michael is supposed to be in a higher power than humans, and if anybody was going to be for God, it's Michael. His name does mean, 'who is like god'. He is angel for God's army in the bible readings. If anything, Michael should be the villain in the film, rather than arch-angel Gabriel (Kevin Durand) because Michael is also known as the angel of death, carrying the souls of all the deceased to heaven. I think the writers didn't read too much into the bible, to know that. At less, they got the Enochian (the language of the angels) writing right. The whole possession sub-plot is dumb. I thought angels are supposed to lead in example. You wouldn't believe it, but they are possession by angels, considering how foul mouthed and unnatural they are. Why are they acting like demon insects? It's doesn't make sense anyways. Two angels can come to earth in their own bodies, but all other angels must possess human beings before they can come. What!? The action is mediocre, at best. I like how Charlie after giving birth, is able to do all the action scenes, without any sense of pain. She recovery very quickly, not only for just giving birth, but also being a smoker. I like how a newborn baby can survive a horrific car crash with multiple flips and rolls without a scratch. The visual & special effects were pretty good. The screen writing is not that good. It had cheesy one-liners, and a simple script that was stretch 30 minutes for a film with just inane dialogue and one ""suspense"" sequence with a dude exploding. The movie had this bittersweet ending that leaves audience with a sense of bad taste. I don't know why Syfy find this movie, good enough for a TV Show pilot. Also the comic book tie-in, is an insult, as it focus on the Arab-Israeli Conflict with a Palestinian is sent to suicide bomb an Israeli airport but ends up fighting angels instead. Yeah, he basically has to fight angel-possessed IDF troops. It's so stupid. Overall: OMG! This movie is bad.",Legion
35,The-Sarkologist,Don't Judge a Movie by its Poster,2,29 June 2013,"This movie is rubbish and as such I will not make any statement regarding 'spoiler alert' because if I have spoiled this movie and you no longer want to see it, then I have saved you from wasting 1.5 hours of your life which you will never get back. I saw this movie in Brisbane by myself simply because I liked the picture of the angel with a sub-machine gun and sword. I guess the saying 'you can't judge a book by its cover' works just as well for movies. Not that I give that statement any real credence because, usually, the first thing that attracts me to a book (other than its reputation) is its cover. I won't say the same for movies though because the first thing that attracts me to movies are the trailers.Anyway, this movie is set in the end of the world, the Battle of Armageddon, and it takes place in a small diner in the middle of the Mojhave Desert, and is fought by the arch angel Michael and a bunch of other randoms. As can be expected, most of the characters are killed off, one by one, until only a couple are left, and then Michael goes out and fights the big bad guy, the arch angel Gabriel, and wins. The world is saved and everything goes back to normal, minus the many people that were killed off in the movie.Some would call this a horror movie, but I won't. It is nowhere near a horror movie. Doctor Who has elements of horror in it, as does a number of Steven King's earlier works. This movie is just an excuse to cash in on Armageddon (and judging the takings as indicated on IMDb, it succeeded, but then it is much easier to make a profit from a movie that took only $26 million to make, as opposed to a movie that costs $260 million).Anyway, I could go on and talk about these types of movies, and the nature of the last battle and the end of the world, but I won't, because I'm sure you have much better things to do.

As a bonus, the movie was good, too.'Legion' is an apocalyptic (in the making) fantasy action horror film full of surprises and boasts incredible visuals. The acting wasn't really anything to rave about, but it was perfectly suited for this type of film. My only casting criticism was Tyrese Gibson, who - once again - serves as nothing more than comic relief with an indispensable character - similar to his character in the Fast and the Furious movies. Yawn, Tyrese, yawn...Paul Bettany was good as protagonist demon hunter (and angel) Michael. I enjoyed the characters, who all had a purpose (except for Tyrese's character, off course...). Dennis Quaid is generally good, but I must admit there was nothing special about his character or acting in this movie. Bettany stole the show in every scene. Then again, this film is not about great acting or compelling characters, as it may. It is about a fight between good and evil, and a film laden with special and very good visual effects.Yes, there are flaws, but the entertainment value is very high and there's loads of action and suspense. On the downside, no matter how many times I watch this movie, I still don't understand why this particular baby is so important. Not enough information is given on the baby and why it is so special.Despite these issues, I do live this movie. It is entertaining and that's what movies are all about.

I bet not even the the writers didn't know why the baby in question was so important in first place and decided to include him just to keep the ridiculous plot going. Weak.)

What's its purpose? What's its message? Where is its audience!? Regardless of my religious beliefs or any pretext surrounding Christianity, there's more reason to believe in God then there is to ""have faith"" in this atrocity. An angel has been sent to down to protect a diner full of people, including a pregnant woman, as he disagrees with God's plan to wipe out humanity. So he/she/it chooses to send angels to destroy humanity instead of flooding, nuking or imploding the world. He has lost faith that much, that he/she/it couldn't be bothered to do it themselves? Surely, suuuurely there are more methodical ways to kill us. Why has he/she/it lost faith in us anyway? Rise in terrorism? Overpopulation? Global warming? There was no reasoning for this catastrophic decision. And so, ultimately, the film makes no sense and holds no purpose. There are only three good scenes: crazy old woman climbing the ceiling and stating ""your baby will burn"", an elongated ice cream van driver and the fight between Michael and Gabriel. That's it. Nothing else is redeemable and worth your time. The acting, ohhhh the acting. Bettany must've had some religious epiphany or some weird experience, for he also starred in 'Priest' a year later, so I can only assume it was his mid-life crisis. He was fine. Everyone else? No. Black should be drifting in Tokyo. Gibson shouldn't be in films. Quaid doesn't even care. The rest of the cast were just B-list stars trying to give their all to a lacklustre screenplay which contains no character development whatsoever. These characters are lifeless. You don't care about their outcome, heck I wanted the angels to decimate the entire diner so the film could end. The fact it was all set in one location may seem inspired, but the horrific use of CGI (I mean seriously...) negated any ""genius"" environmental set pieces. Urgh, I'm done.

The Archangel Michael has been assigned by God to destroy the last vestige of Mankind's hope and thereby bring about the Appoclypse. However, Michael's refusal causes God to substitute the Archangel Gabriel instead. This battle of the Angels takes place in the middle of the desert in a run down diner wherein a group of strangers have collected. There, the Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany), Bob Hanson (Dennis Quaid), the restaurant owner and his son Jeep (Lucas Black) and others meet and face the Archangel Gabriel (Kevin Durand) and his zombie-like minions.

Paul Bettany is usually a good actor, but his performance was pretty boring.But some performances are not a total miss like Kate Walsh, Charles S.

43,freemantle_uk,"Paul Bettany fighting angels, how did they get it so wrong?",4,28 January 2011,"Paul Bettany is a very talented actor, but he is rarely been a leading man. In most American films he is often been a supporting actor, with Wimbledon being the only major Hollywood film he was the lead character. He missed out leading A Knight's Tale because the studio thought Heath Ledger would be more bankable. But now director Scott Stewart has discovered Bettany and cast in the leading role in Legion and Priest.At Christmas time God has lost faith in mankind and plays to send a swarm of angels to exterminate all of mankind. The angels take over the weak to kill the strong. They main target is a pregnant waitress, Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) in the Mojave Desert: she is carrying the mankind's only hope. One angel comes to Earth to protect the baby, Michael (Bettany) and in a small café with a group of non-affected people against the swarm.Paul Bettany does give his all in the film and tries to make Michael an interesting character. He is a character with a claim demeanour. Bettany had to act with a collection with a forest of actors and he still tried his best. He physically looks the part of a fallen angel. The only other actor who was decent was Kevin Durand as Gabriel, God's personal messenger and best warrior and I really like how he was given a heavenly sounding voice. It is an interesting idea of angels clashing amongst each other and Michael becomes a fallen angel, like Satan rebelling against God.The religious story is obvious, a baby that is going to be the survivor of mankind is going to be born in the desert at Christmas time. There are ideas of the apocalypse/rapture of God turning on man and leaving humans with no hope. But Legion does not fulfil all this promise.Legion also take ideas from other films. One film it has often been compared to is the first two Terminator films, with a protector sent to save a mother and child from some powerful element. The way people turned into demonic angels was pretty much lifted from The Matrix when ordinary people turned into angels. The way the angels looked was like from a combination of horror films, from 28 Days Later, the remake of Dawn of the Dead, Zombieland and I Am Legend as well as the Futurekind from the third series of Doctor Who. The siege element was very much like a zombie film, like Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead (both versions) and when Michael has to battle his way through a lot of Angels it was like the scene in The Matrix when Neo raids a building and throws away different guns when he uses up the bullets. Also I thought the story reminded me a little of the Doctor Who episodes the Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit, where Satan takes control of an alien species and attacks a small group of humans in a space station. Those episodes were better then Legion.Legion is basically an exploitation film, but will intentions of being something smarter. It is set around a three action scenes involving the siege, a prologue scene and a final fight scene. It is violence and is almost like a Uwe Boll film with the use of children in the horror. It is done simply for shock value. There is early promise when Michael falls to Earth and he hacks off his wings. But Stewart does film some of the action scenes with almost no light and make its hard to see anything. The fight between Michael and Gabriel should have been epic but the lack of light ruined it.Many of the other characters in the film are simply stock characters and we do not get to know much about them. Stewart pretends to give them depth but it fails. We just do not care about them. It is fun to look at Willia Holland dressed in a short skirt and a low crop top but the film really does suffer when Bettany and Durand are not on screen.3.5/10.",Legion
44,PWNYCNY,"Forget about the movie, read the Bible instead.",4,28 January 2010,"Once again Hollywood has ventured into a region it does not belong, this time being interpretation of biblical scripture. In this movie, the treatment of the subject of the apocalypse is so simplistic that it is embarrassing. Has Hollywood no shame? Is there anything the movie moguls will not film in their quest to make a buck? Everything about this movie is ludicrous, from the acting, to the art direction, to the ridiculous special effects, to the story itself. Yet somewhere someone thought this story good enough to invest money in this project, which proves once again that, the current economic hardships notwithstanding, there's plenty of money out there. Yet the movie does feature some interesting and amusing scenes, such as the old lady who crawls on the ceiling and throngs of possessed people stumbling around with spinning heads. But enough said. If you want to learn more about the bible, pass on this movie and instead read the book.What is one to do when a old lady enters a restaurant, orders a raw steak and then proceeds to crawl on on the ceiling? This is one of the interesting questions explored in this offbeat but entertaining take off on the apocalyptic theme. The movie has its flaws, such as its rather pedestrian interpretation of Biblical scripture and its rather laughable special effects which could give some in the audience a headache (to appreciate this better one must see the movie). If mankind is at the brink of extinction and must rely on one hero to save it, then we can only hope that that hero is NOT the angel Michael depicted in this movie. Angels are supposed to be powerful all knowing messengers of the Almighty and should be depicted as such. To depict them as being something else is not only stretching literary license to the limit, it distorts the biblical message and reduces the movie to being just another fx extravaganza, interesting to watch but dramatically empty.",Legion
45,MBunge,God obviously needs a new wireless provider,4,16 February 2012,"Legion is like a snowball of stupid rolling down the side of a mountain. It just gets bigger and bigger, faster and faster, until it is so hugely dumb it could crush a small house. It's a religious-themed action flick made by people who've clearly never read the Bible and think watching The Prophecy, The Terminator and Night of The Living Dead is a suitable substitute. The special effects folks here should definitely be hired if DC Comics ever decides to make a Hawkman movie and the cast is certainly game, but the ever increasing idiocy of the script washes this movie away like a giant mudslide. It's like the whole thing was scribbled down in 30 minutes an hour before they started shooting the first scene. In some ways, it's like the quintessential action flick of the 21st century. It looks good and has a couple of interesting concepts but the story is so full of plot holes, clichés, non sequiturs and other nonsense that you can't understand how it every got made as it is. There are at least half a dozen points where anyone watching this calamity with an IQ over 60 would point at the screen and say ""That doesn't make any sense"". It may seem like I'm being overly harsh, but Legion has enough style, plenty of good actors and a provocative premise and all of it goes completely to waste because of a screenplay that I wouldn't wipe my ass with.God has decided to wipe out Mankind and the archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) rebels against his orders, cuts off his wings and races to save the one child that might redeem Humanity. He finds the child still in the womb of his unwed, cigarette smoking, desert roadside diner waitress of a mother (Adrianne Palicki). Fortunately, Michael has brought along plenty of guns for the other occupants of the diner as they have to blast away as the zombified motorists who descend on the place. After an initial assault, the zombies pull back and don't do anything for the rest of the movie. There are some crudely written scenes of interaction that are supposed to make us care about the people in the diner and then the archangel Gabriel (Kevin Durand) shows up to spin around like a top and smash things with his tricked out mace, because the power of the Lord apparently manifests itself through rapid rotation and artifacts from the James Bond of the Dark Ages.Now, if you're asking yourself why the Almighty didn't just smite the whole diner with a ball of Heavenly firecongratulations! You're smarter than the people who made Legion. Don't get too full of yourself, though. Most guinea pigs are smarter than these filmmakers.Let me lay it out for you. There's a point in the story where it is undeniable that God has changed his mind and no longer wants to destroy Mankind. There is literally no other way to interpret what happens. Yet, Gabriel continues to try and kill the child as if his celestial cellphone is out of its coverage area and God can't get him the message to stop. Not only that, but several innocent people get killed by Gabriel AFTER it's obvious God has changed his mind. It's like these filmmakers really do think the Supreme Being is some guy with a beard sitting on a cloud yelling down at the Earth ""Hey! I said stop! What are you, deaf?""And it's not like there's a lot of great action in Legion. There's some gunfire at the beginning and some angel-on-angel violence at the end, but there's a whole lot of talking in between.

One of the things that does not work in the movie is Lucas Blacks performance, it is very wooden and fake. I haven't really seen him in much, but dear god I hope his acting was better in his other films. Another thing that I thought was weak and underwhelming was Paul Bettany's acting at times. His performance wasn't bad throughout, but there are a few scenes where you just can't take him seriously. Now, for some things that worked. I liked Dennis Quaid, I thought he did a very nice job with his role, and the other actors did well also. The action sequences are constructed well, they're exciting and engaging to watch. The special effects are doable, definitely not the best, but they do the job alright. The pacing is choppy sometimes, going from deep talks between characters to shoot em up action scenes.

But, unfortunately, while we do get a bit of back-story about Michael, Jeep, and Alex's mom, I must admit I am unsure why this, of all movies, was chosen to become a series. However, the question needs to be asked: is this necessarily a bad movie or just one not strong enough to warrant a series?Characters & StoryIn the middle of nowhere is a pregnant mother to be Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) who works at this middle of nowhere diner owned by Bob (Dennis Quaid). A man whose son, Jeep (Lucas Black), works right next door doing automotive work. Joining them in this oddly placed diner is the fry cook Percy (Charles S. Dutton), who we don't learn too much about, and no sign of whoever Charlie's baby father is. Though is Jeep had his way, he would step in and be the man Charlie and her baby needs. Which Charlie does appreciate, but seems to not look as a viable option. For not only does she not want Jeep romantically, but she doesn't want the baby either. I mean, she smokes while pregnant!But, one day, perhaps a month or so before she is due to give birth, what seems like another boring day becomes the eve of the apocalypse. It all begins with this seemingly sweet old lady named Gladys (Jeanette Miller), and then the situation escalates to a horde of lower angels outside Bob's diner. Then two arch angels battling it out and wrecking the place. Why you may ask? Well, all over Charlie's baby.PraiseFor those who watch Dominion, the sole thing this movie offers is a bit of background behind Jeep as well as help us get to know Alex's mother. Outside of that, this movie does make the Michael and Gabriel on Dominion a bit disappointing. If just because Paul Bettany as Michael, and Kevin Durand as Gabriel, are far more appealing in the roles than their successors on Dominion. Bettany doesn't have Tom Wisdom's weird brooding persona which makes it seem like he wants to be in an Anne Rice movie, but more so belongs in Twilight. Then, as for Durand as Gabriel, there is this actual menacing persona which isn't diluted as he speaks in a sentimental nature when it comes to God or Michael. Unlike Carl Beukes on Dominion.CriticismI must note though, when it comes to scenes without Bettany and Durand, I am unsure how this movie made nearly 70 million dollars. For while Quaid and company certainly aren't boring, at the same time the action scenes don't bring anything which makes the film look any better than the show. In fact, with the movie being focused solely in or around the diner, I would argue the pilot of Dominion brings you a much more interesting universe than the movie. For while we see a young Jeep, Alex's mother Charlie, and even get some flashbacks to this small set which represents heaven, nothing seems to really flesh out the story to the point it makes the movie worth seeing, even if you are a fan of the show. I say this because the story itself is rather shallow and keeps the audience on a need to know basis. Then when it comes to the angels taking over humans, while I did enjoy Miller's scenes, and this evil child which came after her, at the same time it felt more campy than scary. Which may have been the point, but at the same time it just seems like the movie is stuck between wanting to be taken seriously and having an almost Zombieland tone without any outright jokes.Overall: TV ViewingI'm glad I didn't pay for this film because it really does feel underdone for an action movie. For with a shoddy story, rather tame action, and really most of the characters not being all that interesting, I must admit I am tempted to say to skip this. Though if you are a fan of the show which was inspired by this, I think this movie does have some value. Even if it seems like a two hour promo. However, if you have no interest in Dominion I don't think this movie at all will convince you to give the show a chance. And, to be quite honest, this film isn't even good enough to really help me understand why it was turned into a TV series.",Legion

God has lost faith in humanity, and has sent his army of angels out to kill. St. Michael shows up and helps a bunch of folks make a stand in a old diner outside Paradise Falls in the Mohave Desert. One of them is pregnant with the child who Michael knows is the key to humanity's salvation.This formula has been done a million times before. Writer/Director Scott Stewart thinks he can get away with using it simply by changing the shape of the antagonist. There are no zombies/werewolves or vampires here, there is something much more biblical idiotic. Surprisingly, Legion is not quite as bad as most people say. It's moderately entertaining. The problems are in the direction.Scott Stewart may have a nice juicy resume for a visual effects artists, but he is no director. His attempts to flesh out characters are noble, but he does it using your basic amateurish over exposition dialogue, and the middle section is bloated, with boring one on one conversations between the six or seven people we are supposed to be rooting for. A good director would dedicate about twenty to twenty five minutes of screen time to character and the rest to action. That doesn't exactly happen here.Legion is not scary but it is frequently amusing. Among other things I got a kick out of Doug Jones' cameo, as a possessed ice cream man. There is also one short sequence in heaven where St. Micheal and St. Gabriel have a brief conversation about the fate of humanity. Somehow it turns out to be more humorous than was probably intended.Considering angels are supposed to be immortal, the whole plot is pretty pointless, but that's pretty much the only way you can treat Legion if you want to come away from it having been somewhat entertained. It probably would have worked much better as a comedy like Zombieland.A few evocative shots, some silly/fun action scenes, a couple of unintentional laughs, and a mystifying performance from Paul Bettany, are just barely enough for me to give Legion a pass.",Legion

There are plot holes here and there, like for instance, how come Charlie's child is the hope of mankind? what is the cause of this? the movie doesn't really elaborate on this. The development is more focused on the action side than doing justice to a complete story development.

Now I must say that I am extremely surprised by the low grades the movie has on IMDb, given that so many worse movies have ratings in their 6s or 7s...There are definitely things not right in this movie with the whole middle sequence surprisingly poor and borderline terrible in its lack of logic - possessed suddenly stop attacking and let the one thing they are preventing from happening happen... That said the acting was at least good and characters are well presented. Add to that a very good fight sequence with the angel Gabriel and I found this movie a good if uninspiring watch.",Legion
55,Weirdling_Wolf,'Legion' certainly makes for some effectively brainless entertainment!,7,14 December 2020,"After angelic-looking Angel, Michael (Paul 'Priest' Bettany) brusquely lands in cinematically ominous downtown L.A, appropriating a strikingly familiar Schwarzeneggerian manner we discover that our heaven-descending, god-defying, ripped-chested warrior is mankind's sole protector now that 'the big fella' upstairs has damned us all to such a catastrophic end! While I have always felt the horror film was absurd enough without adding religion, all too many genre filmmakers just can't help themselves from persistently pilfering 'The Good Book' and director, Scott Stewart's 'Legion' is more gleefully god-bound than most! Sticking resolutely to a prototypical Romero scenario, a disparate group of demographically divined screenplay archetypes are anxiously holed up in a remote, rundown eatery called Paradise Falls, frantically fending off a ravening horde of piranha-toothed demons all apparently doing the lord's (Skynet!) busy work, namely consuming the fleshly faces of those once so lovingly made in his sacred image and being murderously possessed to single-mindedly kill the fledgling saviour child (John O'Connor). No, I merely jest, as the mewling infant prophet/protector of errant mankind remains unnamed, but, for me, he definitely looks like a John! (Sorry, my bad!!!) As a claustrophobically mounted ensemble piece, the acting is fairly robust across the board, but the especially gifted character actor, Charles S. Dutton's earnest portrayal of the Truck stop diner's demon-beleaguered, one-armed, philosophically-minded short order cook lends the frequently formulaic, cliché-riddled, bullet-raddled script some much needed three dimensional, flesh and blood humanity. In this increasingly bellicose people vs. Pestilence, bible-pilfering B-Movie apocalypse, the colourfully CGI-assisted action comes thick and fast, doing its boisterous best to noisily distract the viewer from its innately Cameronian premise! Right at the very end it becomes abundantly clear that 'The Terminator' allusions were somewhat less than illusory, since the very last scene has our plucky survivor's drive off into an uncertain future with its portentous, Noirish voice over is practically a straight lift from James Cameron's still evidentially influential work! As an enjoyably hokey, fast-moving, bathos-bloated example of sub-Twilight Zone ephemera, ''Legion' certainly makes for some effectively brainless entertainment.",Legion

This started out like it was another episode of the Twilight Zone, or X-Files, and I almost said I've seen this before. But, no, Michael didn't appear in those shows . Michael, in human form, does all he can to protect the baby. I assume you know who Michael is and now has to resort to human weapons. Soooo , we have a new twist. Game on.The action scenes were good as was the CGI, but it was the talky, preachy dialogue that gave this a made-for-TV feel. Not really scary and practically no tension. But, in order for the human race to continue, the baby must live. No explanation was offered as to what this baby would accomplish in life for that to happen. I'm just wondering. Also apparently, the author of this has never read Revelations otherwise he would never have had God try to end the human race in a diner, in a desert, with a legion of angels looking like zombies.

57,Troy_Campbell,Absolutely dreadful.,2,10 June 2010,"Note to Mr Bettany: how on God's green Earth could you have ever conceived that this movie would be worth doing? Did you yearn for something a bit more ""fun"" than the normal dramatic turns you're known for? Well, if this is the kind of crap you mistake for ""fun"" then perhaps you should stick to the more serious roles that you are, incidentally, bloody good at. It's possible it looked good on paper and went downhill during production and post-production, so you're off the hook this time... just.Note to everyone else: steer clear of what will surely be the year's biggest flop. Legion is cram packed with unintentionally laughable dialogue, awful acting and shocking special effects that would struggle to meet the CGI standards of 1985. It's a shame everything fails so epically though as the trailer promised some dumb 'tattooed angel blasts his way through meaner angels' amusement, as low-bar-setting as that is, which could have passed as b-grade schlock if nothing else.Writer-director Stewart attempts to add a moralistic message – be kind to your fellow man and try to do right – to the proceedings but when the very next scene involves some preposterous spider-alien-thingy driving an ice-cream truck it only serves as another reminder of how this film gets it all wrong. However it's not as humiliating as the stupefyingly bad acting by Lucas Black as local redneck Jeep – yep, I'm not joking, his name is Jeep – a sure-fire contender at the Razzies for worse performance.Absolutely dreadful.1 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Legion

Once I realized it wasn't even close I still couldn't help myself being entertained by this movie. The trick is that you have to have no expectations at all. The premise is pretty straightforward and has no depth. Although it could have because of the biblical references. For whatever reason the makers of this movie decided to keep it simple,throw the plot overboard and focus on action.And there you have it, ""Legion"" is an action movie pure and simple.

59,oneguyrambling,Legion is a lousy film. I'm about to give it a 6 out of 10.,6,27 November 2010,"I would rather re-watch this than about 20 other films ranked a 6 or better. Why? Because as crappy as this is, (and it is indeed crappy), it is good-bad rather than just bad-bad or even boring-good.It knows that it is ultimately a trashy flick and rather than try to elevate itself above and pretend it is something it is not, it embraces the trash and actually turns up the ham-ometer to 11 in the last 20 minutes.An angel lands in Los Angeles 2 days before Christmas. How do we know he's an angel? Two words: Big F*cking Wings.At least initially, he promptly cuts off his wings, marinates them in a light sauce and finds weapons. I made part of that sentence up, you guess which.More things happen, but ultimately the ex-angel and a bunch of random characters end up at a remote diner on a highway seemingly in the middle of nowhere called the Paradise Falls Diner.Kooky.The diner is owned by Dennis Quaid and staffed by his son, a cook and the waitress Charlie, who is pregnant. Charlie is the only character worth naming here (even though the other guys are fine and actually include some really good actors), you'll see why soon. Similarly the clientele of the diner includes a family with a teenage skanky daughter, and a black guy.All up there are 8 people in the diner Until a kindly old lady shows up and after a friendly chat with the staff and customers, she orders a rare steak, swears profusely, rips out a throat and climbs the ceiling.All in roughly that order.Once the old lady is dispatched all involved are understandably a little perturbed, and after an aborted trip to the hospital (Cut off by swarms of insects. Might I suggest a plague?) it becomes evident that everyone is trapped by a storm that is encroaching on both sides.Now Paul Bettany shows up as the ex-angel Michael and this is where things get even zanier. Michael is grim and serious but not very enlightening, even though he always seems to be holding back a chuckle. His only warning is ""They're coming"", and to barricade the diner and brace for impact.When the full on assault arrives, it is driving an icecream truck. I mean, what else would it be? Once Mr Icecream truck driver is no longer a more typical horde show up, consisting of people that have been possessed by something. All need dispatching.By this stage you might justifiably be asking ""What the hell is going on?"", I was.Trust an ex-angel to sort us out. During an inexplicable lull in the attack Michael explains: Charlie the waitress is pregnant with a baby that can turn the tide in an angelic war. Michael is trying to protect it, everyone outside; including the aforementioned Icecream man is trying to kill it.Glad that's settled then.The final 30 minutes had me grinning from ear to ear as I struggled to accept that the filmmakers actually believed that they could pull this off. There were fistfights, sword fights, gun fights, an exploding husband, redemption for some, doom for others, swarms of baddies being slaughtered and much preposterously pompous dialogue.There was a heap ripped off from The Prophecy, a bunch from The Terminator and it was all topped off with some all-original Legion cheese.And it was all funny as sh*t.I dunno, this was never going to be a work of art. I guess it is up to you if you can muzzle your bullsh*t detector and spend the 90 minutes watching this stuff. For some reason this mostly hit my funny bone, not my gag reflex, so while I fully admit this is a steaming turd, I thought it was hilarious.Final Rating – 6 / 10.

I can see a lot of negative reviews on here but they must be by people who had high hopes or people who went to the cinema to watch this - for me I found this on a satellite channel one cold night. I had no expectations and the only thing I hoped was that I wasn't wasting my night. God is annoyed with humans, he's lost faith in us and thinks it'll be better to wipe us out. God unleashes a horde or evil angels to reap the souls of Earth as punishment, it's up to Paul Bettany as Archangel Michael and a handful of patrons at a desert highway diner to save the world. Michael was part of the original 'apocalypse' plan but has rebelled against God in favour of fighting for humankind and now finds himself amongst them trying to protect amongst others, a pregnant mother carrying a child he believes will be the saviour of man kind in the future. As Michael defeats wave after wave of evil angels even more darker and twisted angels are sent. Watching this film felt like playing a computer game, it felt like each wave of evil got stronger and I was waiting for the lead up to the final boss. The acting was average, the script wasn't annoying, the visuals were embracing enough. This is plain and simple a comic book version of a war between good and bad. In that guise Bettany delivers with his broody approach while Dennis Quid manage to provide occasional light relief. Maybe I enjoyed this as I didn't pay to watch it and had no expectations.

This has a nasty habit of heating up quite nicely only be let down by sluggish pacing and an overly long run time. There's a scene that by the end amounts to the best part of the film which features a freaky old woman that as it happens is more funny than scary, and if the film had carried on at that pace then this could have been a halfway good watch, but sadly no, as the rest of the film is hardly worth watching.

Michael (Bettany) comes down from the heavens in true Terminator-style, quickly ripping off his wings so that he can fit in with humanity. From here, he heads out into the desert to search for a pregnant woman named Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) who carries ""the last hope for humanity."" Why that is is never really explained. Guess it was just a roll of the dice for poor Charlie. Bummer girl! There are so many throwaway characters that we never really give a rats-rump about any of them, including Dennis Quaid (PANDORUM), Tyrese Gibson (TRANSFORMERS), Kate Walsh (GREY'S ANATOMY) and Charles S.

65,ajs-10,"Better than I expected, but still disappointing...",5,22 May 2011,"This film has attracted some really bad reviews but I decided to see for myself just what everyone was getting so het up about. Well, although it's not the best film in the world, it's far far better than many would have you believe. Yes, the premise is pretty preposterous, but I like the execution and I like the performances and so it turned out not as awful as I feared. I should say for the record that I'm not a religious man as so wasn't offended by the use of religious iconography in this film.A waitress, Charlie, who works in a diner on a deserted road in the Mojave Desert is heavily pregnant. She is looked after by Jeep Hanson and his father Bob, who owns the diner. It's a typical day with the usual comings and goings, but there's something in the air. And when a sweet old lady tells Charlie her baby is going to burn before going crazy and trying to kill everyone, they all know something is seriously wrong. Then a stranger arrives, he is heavily armed and ready for a fight. He calls himself Michael and claims he is a fallen angel. He has come to save Charlie's baby from the coming apocalypse as he is the only hope for mankind. More people arrive, but they are possessed and have only one thing on their minds. Many are killed but they are soon beaten back. Can this small band hold out until the baby comes, or will the possessed return to take the baby? A tough one I know, but I'm not going to tell you here.The film is pretty well made with some nice special effects and some decent performances. It is let down by a rather weak story that could have been done with much more mystery than it was. Decent performances all round; Paul Bettany did a good job as Michael, although I felt he wasn't really stretched, although he did have some of the best dialogue. Lucas Black was OK as Jeep Hanson and it was nice to see Dennis Quaid as his father Bob. Tyrese Gibson was also good as the reformed bad guy Kyle Williams and Adrianne Palicki was OK, without being spectacular as Charlie. Finally a mention for Charles S. Dutton who did a good job as the chef, Percy Walker.It very much put me in mind of the 1976 John Carpenter film, Assault on Precinct 13 with the quite claustrophobic feel of it. It's just a shame that the premise behind the storyline wasn't better thought out, or that the character of Michael didn't have more mystery about him. As I said at the beginning though, I think it was well produced and there were some decent performances. I know many won't agree, but I didn't dislike it all that much I won't recommend it, but neither will I consign it to the reject pile, with this one I'll give you a free choice.My Score: 5.2/10",Legion

67,innocuous,"Let me see...OK, five stars.",5,12 May 2010,"Not the worst ""angels have descended from heaven to end the human race"" film I've seen, but not the best either. (For sheer creepiness, you can't beat ""The Prophecy."") The story is a well-worn one, but not offensively so. It's pretty much a combination of every stuck-in-a-diner movie and zombie movie you've ever seen.The first hour or so is acceptable, though the CGI FX are pretty lame. Bettany is actually pretty convincing, while everyone else (including Quaid) is a stereotype. Forget about the plot, though, as it makes no sense whatsoever. Editing is par for the course, which means a lot of confusion during fight scenes. Pacing is not as good, as the film has very little flow.One area that is above-average is the sound. (I watched this on Blu-ray with a decent system.) The surround effects are definitely nice, though they don't define the standard or anything. One thing that really jumped out at me were the gunshots. Most filmmakers are total losers when it comes to gunshots, reducing the volume significantly and using some canned sounds that are totally inappropriate for the specific weapon. The gunshots in ""Legion"" are pretty intense, which adds to the tension during gunfights. (On the other hand, the stupid armorer/prop master for the film pulls the usual newbie mistake by handing several of the weapons to the actors with only a round or two in the magazine. The actor fires the required number of rounds, the slide on his pistol locks back indicating that the magazine is empty, and the actor just keeps on firing in the next shot without ever reloading. In most movies, you'll see that the slide locks back at the completion of every single shot. Are these guys idiots, or what? You can get around this by loading a snap cap after the last round so the slide doesn't lock back. This ends the shot with an inert round in the chamber.) So....I give it five stars.

It's not an awful film by any means, but it's far from as good as the trailers make it out to be.It's not a God v Satan movie as we are usually accustomed to seeing, but a God v Humanity story instead. The basic story of it is that God has lost faith in Mankind, so he sends his angels down to wipe out the human race and bring about the Apocalypse. Archangel Michael is sent to kill a baby that is destined to be the savior of mankind but Michael disobeys God's order as he still has faith in humanity. Michael is now trying to keep the baby alive, and with a select few at a roadside diner to help him, he must stave off God's minions...including Archangel Gabriel.Like I said earlier...this isn't a bad movie but it's definitely below average and the main contribution to it being below average is that it's pretty slow & boring. There are a couple of decent scenes here and there (the granny and the ice cream man scenes to name two) but there just wasn't enough to keep your interest peaked, even when the action started as even these became rather dull.The film doesn't take that long to get going, and the story does actually build up quite nicely to begin with, but it doesn't take long to stall either and come to a bit of a halt. Even the fight between Gabriel and Michael was a bit of a damp squib.Also, I'm not sure why some people think the reason that those who thought this movie was average was because they didn't ""get it"". There was nothing ""to get"" as we knew the story of what was going on and it's not like it was some sort of really deep, meaningful film with hidden meanings.Anyway, this wasn't a hideous movie but there is definitely much better Apocalyptic type movies out there to be enjoyed.",Legion
70,the-movie-guy,Maybe God should have sent another flood instead of his Legion of Angels,4,22 January 2010,"(Synopsis) After 2000 years, God has lost his acceptance of humanity, and believes they are no longer worthy of Him. God decides to send his Legion of Angels to destroy the human race in the final Apocalypse. But Archangel Michael (Paul Bettany) rebels against God, because he believes God is wrong and humanity should have another chance.

Michael assembles a group of diner patrons to help protect Charlie (Adrianne Palicki), the pregnant waitress whose child is about to be born and is mankind's savior from extinction.(My Comment) Now this is one abysmal story line, God is feed up with humanity so he decides to destroy it. He sent a flood the first time, and now God sends his angels to wipe out the entire human race on earth as if everybody was bad. You can see why Archangel Michael rebelled against him. At least we don't see God's Legion of Angels flying around killing people as angels. The angels first must take possession of the bodies of weak people, before they begin their killing spree. There are two great scenes that take place; the first is the little old spider granny who attacks people in the diner, and the second is the battle between Archangel Michael and Archangel Gabriel (Kevin Durand). The moral to this story is, ""Gabriel did what God wanted, but Michael did what God needed."" If you look at the movie as a mindless horror flick, then the movie's CG scary scenes are not too bad, but if you take it too seriously, the plot is totally flawed. This is one movie you can miss.

71,doctorsmoothlove,Is it Heaven or Hell and doesn't it matter?,5,18 October 2010,"How infallible is God? It is generally understood that God can make no errors no commit any sins. But, can God misjudge a situation? In spite of having all the wisdom in the universe, can God still be short-sided? Such questions came to me the entire time I was watching Legion. It isn't an innovative movie, and much like Daybreakers, which came out at the same time earlier this year, it relies entirely on its plot summary. Its main idea is so poorly developed and so few of the questions it proposes are answered that it achieves a strange subtly in its critique of Abrahamic (Christian) theology.The world may be ending (again), but not as you haven't read in the family Bible. A child is born to a random woman that will ""save humanity"" from some vague threat. We have apparently angered God, who has conveniently decided to destroy us. An army of angels possess weak-minded people and attack a restaurant where the little savior is sleeping. Some remaining good-hearted humans, aided by newly fallen angel Michael ward off attacks until God sends arch-angels to finish the job. Michael left heaven because he has ""faith"" in humanity. From this point in the movie we observe: God, the entity that can control the essence of reality, cannot manage to overcome a few human beings. I don't consider this a plot-hole because I am an atheist, and even assuming God does exist, how am I able to judge power I cannot experience. As Legion is a fantasy within a fantasy, it can commit a number of contrivances because no one has the ability to refute them unless the film is to be considered legitimate scholarship, which it most certainly isn't. The movie does recreate the several atrocities against humanity, commissioned by the Almighty, as recorded in the Old Testament.After a little while, Michael is killed by another angel and the baby's parents are all that is left. Michael suddenly reappears in magical gilded armour and wards off his former killer. He has given God ""what He needs"". The attacks end. This perpetual vagueness, which is maintained superbly from start to finish, again presents several scenarios. What is the child going to do for humanity? Is he going to lead us into a post-God world in which we handle our own affairs? Is he the Antichrist or the new Christ? Is Michael actually Satan in disguise (he has black wings on the movie poster)? Will Michael become a new Satan? My guess is the child's ""saving of humanity"" is labeled as such from God's perspective. The weak-minded people have now died, and only a few actualized people are left. The baby may have been God's plot to see if any humans were worthy of being saved, even though he should already know that. As Jesus took the last Earthly holiday, Michael took it this time. When he was able to help God realize that there were people worthy of the Kingdom, he returned. Whatever the reason, this is the only theological debate I've ever mustered with myself over a zombie movie.Recommended",Legion
72,Shattered_Wake,'Legion' (2010) - Unintentionally hilarious good fun,4,21 February 2010,"In 'Legion,' heartthrobs Paul Bettany and Tyrese star alongside pacemaker-throb Dennis Quad in a time when God is royally ticked off at just about everyone and everything (judging by recent events, this isn't too far off). To punish mankind for their wicked ways, the Man Upstairs sends down an army of angels to teach the world a lesson. . . that lesson is taught through complete annihilation. Even Steven, right? Well, fair or not, angels rain down upon, where else, a small run-down diner in a small run-down town aptly named Paradise Falls where mankind's only hope rests on the wings of archangel Michael (Bettany) to save them from God's wrath.Watching the trailer, it seemed pretty clear to most viewers. . . if you wanted a laugh, check this film out. It's not a comedy by any means, in fact its overly dark approach only adds to its comedic value. Instead, the horrible CGI, ridiculous one-liners, and possessed grandmas made it seem that 'Legion' would finally be giving Nic Cage's 'The Wicker Man' a run for its money in Hollywood's newest ""so bad they're good"" market. While the unintentional hilarity of 'Legion' doesn't quite reach 'The Wicker Man' (what will?), there is still plenty to laugh at from the insanely bad CGI angel transformations, the ridiculous dialogue, and the hammy acting. There are also some random elements that simply do not make sense in the realm of the film: Why do angels decide to drive crappy cars instead of flying? Why do they get out of breath when angels don't breathe like humans? How are the angels stronger than people yet can't break car windows or overpower a single human? But, hey, suspension of disbelief and all that.Even with all the stupidity, the film does have some value outside of its ""so bad it's good"" qualities, but there isn't enough to make the film worth it. John Lindley's cinematography is good and captures the atmosphere well, but the lame effects ruin the overall look of the film. The pace is pretty solid as well and rarely slows down. . . but, this may have been to just get the movie over with before viewers fully understood the lameness of it all. While the story did have a chance to be very scary, the stupidity of the film completely killed any chance of taking advantage of the disturbing storyline. There's very little to be scared about when you see some weird ice cream man bouncing around like one of the Wheelers from 'Return to Oz' (a film which is, undoubtedly, ten times scarier than 'Legion'). It seems that the main issue that could've fixed almost everything was, simply, the script. They spent millions of dollars on some fairly high-level (in popularity, not talent) actors, but couldn't work a little bit harder to polish up the script for this cast? This led to the misuse of a usually dependable actor like Dennis Quaid as merely a rambling buffoon for much of the film. It really is a shame, though, because the movie did have a serious shot at being good. They just blew it severely in a most hilarious way.Overall, if you're looking for a fun night with a few friends and a case of your favourite brew, get 'Legion' to have a laugh at.

It's just the end of the world at a little diner in the middle of the desert, with the life of a baby in the balance. With tons of shooting. And an ice cream truck.The only thing of any value is the scene with the old lady in the diner, and let me tell you, that's one awesome scene! Probably one of the best demon grandma scenes in cinematic history! Shocking and outrageous - and pretty dang scary too! Wow!!!

Certainly for fans of so-bad-it's-good movies. The scene is set with the archangel Michael (played brilliantly by Paul Bettany) coming to earth in an attempt to save humanity. The majority of the film takes place at a deserted diner in the middle of nowhere and it's a really good spot accompanying the horror theme in the more violent scenes and the apocalyptic brooding of the rest of the film. This does make it sound more serious than ultimately it is; it is played with a straight face throughout which is why I think it doesn't fully work but I also thought it was actually quite darkly comic, particularly certain scenes involving possession of an older person which was hilarious as well as edgy! The supporting cast are very good and everyone puts their all into it but it is Mr Bettany who makes the film more memorable",Legion

77,AndyVanScoyoc,Not Sure What People Were Expecting. Could Have Been GOOD - Some Flaws...,7,26 January 2010,"Okay, after reading all the whiney reviews of this movie from people who think it's too preachy, my advice to them is to LEARN TO DEAL and the next time, if you don't want a preachy movie, DON'T go see a movie involving angels.I saw previews of this movie in theatres and fully admit, the only reason I went to see it was due to Paul Bettany whom I really liked as the twisted but loyal to a fault albino monk, Silas, in The DaVinci Code.So, I went in with an open mind and actually enjoyed the movie though it needed some work. From an author's point of view, and one that takes great pains to make sure my plots have no holes or leave any room for questioning, the storyline was overwhelmingly poorly executed.First off, I'll say to anyone who thought Paul Bettany's performance as Michael was wooden or zombified, you're an idiot. Learn something about angels. They aren't supposed to be human! Okay, now that I have that out of the way, I'll say, the cast was good and I was particularly happy to see Kevin Durand as Gabriel, though I think his role was much too small. Gabriel is the true force of God (God's trumpeter) and so therefore, his role should have been a bit meatier. While Michael is the hand of God basically, Gabriel is the one who is the overseer - for lack of a better word - so Kevin Durand's small role was a real disappointment.I won't go into the plot, you can read the synopsis for that, but I thought Paul Bettany's performance as Michael was spot on and one of the few in the movie worth really paying attention to.Dennis Quaid did a nice job as Bob Hanson, a bitter man who has seen his dreams of riches, die with the area. I didn't care for the role of his son Jeep played by Lucas Black. Was his character supposed to be ""slow""? Because that's how he acted.Anyway, appearances by Tyrese Gibson and Charles S. Dutton round out the cast well, but the movie itself still left a lot to be desired - something that the actors couldn't have fulfilled because they did the best they could with what they were given to work with story-wise.The action was slow, very slow and not nearly enough for what the movie was supposed to be...God's wrath at mankind for frittering away all He has done for us.I would have rather seen the angels themselves come down from Heaven and take on the hapless diner inhabitants rather than using human bodies that looked like demons once they had been possessed. For those in the home audience, angels and demons don't work together, don't want to look like each other and angels don't use evil to fight.In my opinion, the last 30 minutes really spoiled the movie. Once all was said and done (I'll leave it like that so as not to spoil it) the movie should have ended, rather than drone on in an an attempt to tie up loose ends or answer questions.It's a shame too, because people are dying to see well-written movies (and there are a LOT of books on the market that would make great movies - mine included I have been told) and people are sick to death of remakes of movies that were either so good to begin with that they didn't need to be re-made or so bad that they never should have been released to begin with and so for this movie to have had so much potential and then be such a disappointment due to the storyline, is very sad.I enjoyed it...but that was because during the entire film, I was mentally ""fixing"" it. Most people (and particularly those that don't write for a living) don't have that capability or don't want to do it.That has a lot to do with the bad reviews I think, but I would suggest everyone go in with an open mind and then write an intelligent review...not a gut-reaction one.",Legion
78,Thrashman88,Revenge from above,8,10 December 2011,"Despite the god (no pun intended) awful reviews by most users here, I found Legion very entertaining and fun. Those who probably hated it is probably because they're religious or think they are Roger Ebert or some hotshot critic. True, there are many, many loose ends in the story and plot holes the size of the grand canyon, but despite these obvious flaws, Legion remains an entertaining movie. Why is it so hard to believe that the almighty is a vengeful being? After all, according to the bible, he's wiped out cities like Sodom, sent plagues to the Pharaohs and killed humans many times before, so why it is so hard to believe Legion's premise that he's out to wipe out the human race. I'm a catholic and found the premise believable, if any of this apocalyptic jargon is to be true. Angel Michael disobeys God's orders of termination and decides to aid a barricaded group of humans at a lone desert diner. Supposedly, the waitress of this diner carries in her womb the second coming. Him being born will be a sign that humans will live on. Apparently God is SO angry that he won't let his second- coming live. Why??? Well, as I said before, he let Jesus die, so why not save all pain and sorrow and kill his son before he is born?Legion could've gone into a more solemn message and more background on his second coming would've been nice. These ""story opportunities"" would've made for a more satisfying movie, but at its core, Legion is a blood and guts movie, simple as that. The premise of the movie lent itself for grander things, but writer/director Scott Stweart kept things a bit too simple. It's weird seeing ""good guys"" like angels trying to wipe out humans, instead of demons or devils. Yet, angels adopt a demon-like quality when they posses humans, which will have you asking if the almighty and the devil are really that different.The ending could've been more solemn, but I repeat: Legion will please gore and action film fans alike. People looking for answers and devout religion heads will surely hate this film.I haven't had so much fun watching a movie this intense in a long time.",Legion
79,Quebec_Dragon,Neat concept not very well done,5,5 February 2010,"Legion is about the apocalypse and one fallen angel who tries to save the last hope for humanity. With such a high concept, it's weird how it's actually taking place in a rather constrained space : a truck diner lost in an American desert. My first impression was that the special effects looked cheap (witness the first human transformation and the way ""it"" talks while barely moving its mouth). It's an impression that stayed with me throughout until perhaps the final antagonist. My second impression was that the acting wasn't that bad. I didn't recognize the actor playing the main angel character (Paul Bettany) until the day after while reading the credits. He's not one we usually see as an action hero in this kind of flick but he gave a decent performance as the strong stoic type. I also remembered Lucas Black (playing Jeep : what a lousy character's name) from the time he was a talented child actor. He still is. We also have the ever reliable Dennis Quaid in a supernatural thriller yet again. My third impression was that the little old lady (seen in previews) reminded me of the crazy old gypsy woman from ""Drag me to Hell"". It's no wonder she's shown in previews, it's one of the best moments. However it spoils the surprise. My fourth impression was that following the granny, the ""possessed"" people were rather slow, stupid and not particularly menacing, very much like zombies even though they were not. My fifth impression was that at least the filmmakers were trying to achieve character moments instead of tiring us out with incessant action. My sixth impression ,after the film, was that considering the origin of the possessed humans and the objective desired, it was really ridiculous and unbelievable to proceed that way especially considering the supposedly superior intelligence at work. My last impression is that although it's certainly watchable as a distraction, it's not really effective or a particularly good film in the genre despite the ""angels"", seldom seen in features these days. Don't watch ""Legion"" expecting a big-budget epic fantasy, it's more like an intimate, closed space, last stand b-movie thriller without that many thrills.Rating: 5 out of 10 for mediocreP.S. Don't watch it expecting a ""legion"" of ""angels"" either. You would be disappointed.",Legion
80,tburke85,Legion A Flawed But Decent Action Thriller,6,18 May 2010,"Legion is a flawed but decent action thriller from director Scott Stewart who does a good job of making this movie despite it's problems. I didn't think this film was the disaster critics made it out to be. Yeah it has flaws which I'll get into later and it isn't necessarily the best movie I've ever seen but it certainly wasn't the worst either. Paul Bettany is solid as the arch angel Michael who disobeys gods orders to wipe out the human race and instead decides to fight for them. Thats right people in this film God and his angels are the villains. This may upset some people but I felt it was an interesting twist and it worked for the movie. Paul Betttany is quite convincing as Michael especially in the action/fight sequences. I will give him this too. Bettany's character knows how to make one hell of an entrance. He shows up early on and then he disappears for most of the beginning which made him feel a little short handed development wise. When Bettany reappears as Michael at the diner luckily he's in it more after that. Granted Bettany may not win any awards for this role but he still turns in a good performance none the less. The rest of the cast including Lucas Black, Tyrese Gibson, and Adrianne Palicki turn in decent performances. Black sort of sits out action wise until the third act but he delivers a good performance as Jeep Hanson an average joe whose taken under the wing by Michael. Tyrese Gibson is okay as the mysterious drifter Kyle Williams who *spoiler* sort of disappears late in the second act with no explanation after getting bitten. He does what his role requires through I guess. Adrianne Palicki plays Charlie a pregnant waitress whose unborn child must be protected for somewhat unknown reasons except that he will somehow save the human race from annihilation. Palicki is all right as the character who like Gibson does what the role asks of her. The same can be said for Charles S. Dutton, Willa Holland, Kate Walsh, and Dennis Quaid who are effective in their limited screen time. Walsh however seemed to over act at times and I felt she was the weak link in the cast as Sandra who just complains and complains which kind of hurt the film until she eventually bites the dust. Walsh isn't that bad of an actress but this wasn't her best performance. Dutton is good Percy Walker despite not having a whole lot to do and being written out rather quickly in the second act. Quaid like Dutton doesn't have a lot to work with but he brings what he can to the role of Jeep's father Bob. There was some chemistry between him and Black which made their father/son relationship believable for the most part. Kevin Durand is decent but underused as the arch angel Gabriel considering he's only in it for 15 maybe 20 minutes tops. Durand like some of his co-stars does what is asked of him though. Jon Tenney has what amounts to an extended appearance doing what he can with his very small part before becoming a background character for the remained of the second half who like Dutton and Gibson is written out too soon for you to care whether he dies or not. The rest of the relatively unknown cast including Grandma Gladys, Doug Jones as the Ice Cream Man, and the actors playing the possessed are effective in the few minutes their on screen. The action is well executed and the special effects work for the film mostly even if you can some of it is obviously CG. The showdown between Michael and Gabriel near the end is kind of short because those expecting an epic battle royale between two titans will be disappointed but their fight is pretty well choreographed none the less. The movie seemed to take it's time at least trying to develop the main characters in attempt to make you invested in their struggle before diving into the thick of the action which was a nice change considering films of this genre seem to be more about the spectacle than the story and characters. Now that I've mentioned what I liked about it I'll get into the flaws. Many characters (Gabriel, Percy, and Kyle to name a few) aren't developed enough. They are just there with little to do and their characters can come across as one dimensional. A little more development would've helped because if you can get the audience to care about the characters with action sequences well paced they will enjoy it more than a film that was made purely for the spectacle. The dialog wasn't the best at times with characters making stupid decisions sometimes like running out to save people who already dead only to die yourself because it was a trap. The story itself was okay with an interesting twist (God and his angels being the villains)yet it could've been handled much better. There were some predictable moments which weighed down the film a bit. Overall though I didn't find Legion was the epic disaster most critics made it out to be. Yeah sure it has plot holes and flaws with questions left unanswered but Legion wasn't that bad. And if you give the film a chance which I did who knows you might end up enjoying it. I for one thought it was flawed but decent. Legion has enough action, a little suspense, some character development, and solid performances from the cast (especially Paul Bettany) who make this action supernatural thriller worth watching at least once.",Legion
81,galahad58-1,Legion of Garbage,4,20 August 2010,"As a huge Dennis Quaid fan, I was anticipating a better film than the one that I viewed. I expect quality work from Quaid and not some terrible piece of garbage that would be best served as a direct-to-video DVD. There is nothing salvageable in Legion: the story is awful, the acting is non-existent (even Quaid isn't that good), the direction is terrible and the overall look is ridiculous. The fact that angels possess human beings and have them murder and harm other human beings is preposterous. I am not religious at all, but even as a non-believer I had a hard time hearing angels toss out the F-bomb over and over again. I had a hard time watching innocents (children possessed) killing other folk.

Meanwhile, the world is being taken over by angels that are more like demons and they are destroying the world and coming after the baby too. The pregnant mother of this chosen child works at a small café out in the middle of nowhere and her bosses son is always there to protect her and soon finds he is perhaps the most powerful man on earth....yea it wasn't that great.The preview for this film looked so cool and I admit I was dying to see it, but it was a let down. It starts off feeling like Terminator and the mean angels are cool looking, but can easily be killed and don't cause too much of a threat. The story unfolds and gets dumber as it goes and it's laugh out loud funny how these main two angels Michael and Gabriel are all masters of weaponry and skilled with combat moves and stuff... I mean come on this is not terminators from the future they are ""gods angels"" yet they seem like Rambo with wings or something.The direction was okay, and acting was decent. It was a good mix of horrible actors like Kevin Durrand, veteran actors like Dennis Quaid, actors who should think their lucky stars that they are doing an actual movie shown in theaters like Charles Dutton, actors that were out of place and tried too hard and should stick to 'good ole boy' roles like Lucas Black, and actors that only get cast because of their good looks and ability to bring females in like Tyreese Gibson....This movie didn't completely suck, its a nice way to kill an evening, but you won't be amazed or blown away or see anything new here. It's just a stupid little movie. Is it a horror? No! It has blood and gore and stuff but its more like a comic book style movie with a touch of superhero and a touch of sci-fi.It did have some thought provoking messages within it and I liked that about it. I also liked the music, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard and such just worked. I thought it was very fitting to have Haggards ""If we make it through December"" playing as this movie was in December and the patrons weren't sure if they'd make it or not.Lucas Black tries to hard to act here, Kevin Durrand as Gabriel was horrible and I consider him in my top 5 list of worst actors ever. The movie gets super boring and all talky talky in the middle of it and it gets really slow, the story gets dumber as it goes along and there might be a sequel, personally if there is no sequel then I would bet that in 5 years this movie will have been completely forgotten about by most of us. 4/10 stars.",Legion

85,stuka24,Blockbuster to die of ...boredom.,3,11 June 2010,"I saw this film by mistake, and it only taught me how bad big budget cinema can be. During the film I frequently asked myself: Why do these bad films keep on being made? Why manufacture ""more of the same""? OK, some women are very nice Willa Holland & Kate Walsh, probably even nicer. And there's the occasional line by a big actor that tries to deliver us from pain. In this case, Paul Bettany's. But saving this film is like trying the ""unsink"" the Titanic. Dennis Quaid should be banned from cinemas, like an alcoholic/ any drug user :). If I had to get any ""redeeming qualities"", trying hard I'd get the modest ""philosophical"" dialogues when the willfully opposite characters speak out their conscience during guards, before ""the evil ones come up to get them"". And I did feel moderately scared at a couple of times, thou probably an expensive cinema's sub woofers helped a lot to fabricate this desired effect. But it was Amazon reviewer Paul Gaita who really gave me the creeps when he wrote that there may be a sequel coming...My favourite character would be Doug Jones. His wicked ice cream vendor is scary, thou we all know it's just the juxtaposition of ""something really good, associated to childhood and its easy pleasures"" and well, ""violent hungry dead people at night"" or whichever crap that stuffs our nightmares. Charles S. Dutton's down to earthiness was also refreshing, pity his character is dealt with so simply. I liked the trite but effective ""father's words of wisdom"". Yes, it's been said before, and way better, but ""Carpe diem"" is never completely put to practice in our lives, right?

That is exactly what happens here.The script makes no sense at all. I don't mean whether it is true to the Bible (it's not), but whether it is true to at least minimal logic and reason. The Supreme Being in this film is not like any I've ever heard of. So all of the ""action"" is caused by the motives of an unknown person. Well, that seems about the same as justifying totally unmotivated actions.Maybe the relation between the action and ""real life"" was edited out. If characters in the film were supposed to be a counterpart of a Biblical character (there seemed to be some hints), the correlation was not made clear.And I assume the ending was supposed to be a surprise. I was surprised at how incomprehensible it was.But there were some fun parts, especially those which make monsters out of little old ladies and cute little kids, thereby authorizing the extremely guilty pleasure of watching them die in gruesome ways (which would be unthinkable in a normal drama).I don't recommend that you see this on screen.

87,colinrgeorge,"""Legion""",3,6 April 2010,"You can almost feel the English language bend in trying to convey the ineffable awfulness of a film like ""Legion."" The girders of syntax simply can't support the weight of the adjectives necessary to condemn such lazy, irrelevant art. To the mercifully uninitiated, ""Legion"" is a religious action-horror flick in which God being ""tired of all the bullshit"" suffices for plot exposition, and Bible mythology is simultaneously demeaned and validated. However, it's mostly an unabashed third-rate ""Terminator"" knock off, which worst of all, is rarely even fun.And campy fun was all I had hoped for from a film whose poster features the archangel Michael with a dagger in one hand and an automatic weapon in the other. How could you not have a sense of humor releasing an image like that? I imagined a gleefully irreverent action film that would be bad, sure, but nothing if not cheap entertainment. ""Legion"" instead presents itself with an embarrassing self-seriousness that quickly subsides into numbing boredom.Still, the beginning of the film is palatable enough, with the expected expository introduction to each of our protagonists--a clichéd smattering of patrons and employees caught at the ""Paradise Falls"" (Har, har) garage and diner--and Michael, who's opted for mortal strife over enacting God's order to eviscerate mankind. Fortunately for us, the best trick God seems to have up His sleeve is ""possessing"" individuals, which turns them into silly zombie/vampire hybrids with rubber necks, nubby teeth, and the power to walk on ceilings.The group's first encounter with one of these creatures works if only for the sheer weirdness of the circumstance. The vessel is an elderly woman, and the ""Looney Tunes""-esquire shotgun sequence that plays out as she scuttles across the ceiling is tonally more comparable to ""Drag Me to Hell"" than ""Legion"" on the whole. Regrettably, what follows is wave after tedious wave of the possessed arriving (inexplicably by car), only to emerge as rifle fodder in a shameless co-opting of ""Dawn of the Dead.""""Legion"" may wear its influences on its sleeve, but never manages to forge the joie de vivre that make the films it's imitating so successful. The better part of the second act is bogged down by interminable character development, during which the cardboard characters bond in the most artificial, writerly way imaginable. Would you believe that a father and son make amends and a rebellious teen with a conservative mother falls for a black guy? It's groundbreaking stuff.And the most egregious crime of the film is that it doesn't even pitch to its target audience. I don't generally care for schlocky action, but even I concede that the last thing ""Legion"" needs is relatable characters. I'm okay with the fact that we meet them as movie clichés, but as such I have less interest in how they feel than what they do, and for about half of the film, they do absolutely nothing. The finale then culminates with a knock-down, drag out fight between Michael and fellow-angel Gabriel, but watching them swing a mace at one another for fifteen minutes is exactly as exciting as it sounds.""Legion"" is the first feature from director Scott Stewart, who has an impressive history in effects work, though his talents in that field are conspicuously absent here, as is anything beyond the occasional, incidentally amusing moment or unsolicited laugh. The film fails to commit to its Christian apocalyptic premise and ends up feeling vague, boring, and muddled as a result.Worst of all, Stewart is unfaithful to audience expectation, and ""Legion"" falls shy of even ""so bad it's good"" territory. It's a pointless, worthless January abortion that even has the gall to presume itself a sequel. If I ever see a ""Legion 2,"" I think the English language might just snap.",Legion

Go ahead and leave the theater while it is showing, but that is you, and you can't stop others from seeing it, and knowing it was better than your rating of it.It reminds me of more of the TV show Supernatural than anything of Terminator and whatever the other movie they keep on saying on these reviews. Some people that rate here are so lame, that they probably fell asleep, because they are incapable of their own body handling it then when they woke up at the end of it came here, and made up stuff to keep others from seeing it. Half the reviews of movies on this site are just made up reviews to get people from seeing the movie altogether. A lot of movies that are actually rated really high are not even as good as the ones that get rated lower, which makes no sense at all. I would watch it again on DVD.\I rather tell as it is, and not falsely make others not see it, because the person review it make no sense at all then when other see it like me find out that those reviewers have been on something when making the review. It start out with an angel coming to Los Angeles and get a bunch of weapons, while he is loading up on them a cop car pulls up to stop him from taking them. It then goes to a little restaurant in the desert that a lady is pregnant and father and son lives there. Father is nice and lets the lady live there while she works for him as a waitress. Got actors from the Fast and the Furious series in it. It is falsely made that God was evil in this movie, but his is not. He just commands his angels to make sure the apocalypse happens, but the angel at the beginning tries to save the baby that must be born from the lady at the restaurant so mankind can be saved too. It ends where it was a misunderstanding of what God really wanted. It was the angels not following orders that was evil, not God. People watch movies, and say it takes a stupid person to watch this, and understand what is going on, but those are the ones that did not understand why God did what he did in this movie. It was a test of the angels faith, and people reviewing in here are saying that God in this movie is not loving God. Come on people quit making up things that are not true. I won't say anymore to spoil this movie. I recommend seeing it.",Legion

97,deacon_blues-3,Didn't suck that bad.,6,17 June 2010,"I was ready for this thing to really suck. And I must admit that I had to suspend a lot of incredulity to get through it, but over all, it had a decent point (a rather biblical one at that, the way I see it). In the final analysis, God desires mercy, not sacrifice (cf. Hosea 6:6; Matt. 12:7). This is what the Gabriel character did not understand, but the Michael character did. It also reminds me of Abraham's attempt to sacrifice Isaac (Gen. 22:7-13). Of course the whole 2nd coming thing was way off base, and there were a lot of plot holes that an elephant could walk through. The actors tried to make the best of the wordy, sappy dialog, but it was an uphill battle.There were too many silly things done just for gross effects, but making no sense. Michael cutting his wings off and then stitching the wounds (pul-eeze!). The exploding acid dude (why?). Granny wasting time being nice when all she really wanted to do was kill Charlie's baby.Gabriel's mace was more like a super-duper power tool than a real weapon. Why didn't any of the possessed people bring guns or explosives to the diner? The possessed cop at the beginning used a pistol to kill his partner, so why all of a sudden did guns become off-limits for them? The vulnerability of Gabriel was about as inconsistent a subject as I can think of. Could he be hurt or killed by weapons? It would seem the answer is both yes and no, or something like that, anyway. Why did Doug Jones' character bother to grow really long arms and walk like a spider just so he could get gunned down without accomplishing anything? Was he possessed by a spider angel? LOL! What crap!Just a few of so many things that made no real sense but got lost in the lame attempts at creepy, gory special effects and action sequences. All-in-all, not a good film, but not as bad as I thought it would be. At least the writer and director showed some understanding of their subject matter, and the point they were reaching for was actually biblical and worthwhile.",Legion
98,RickHarvey,Legion,4,21 November 2010,"There not much to say about Legion except that it bland,boring and forgettable. The opening act was cheesy and whenever a pair or group of characters converse between one another, i just couldn't help but not care. From the second the old lady became demented, you knew not to take this film seriously and that OK. Not every film needs to be like that but with Legion, it came across as trying to be something it shouldn't. The character development was a chore to get through. What a way to get to know people by locking us in with them, sitting our self downs at there tables and being forced to listen to their verbal diarrhea. The opening thirty minutes was bearable with the odd laugh now and then. The biggest laugh had to be when the saviour arrived at the diner via cop car. That scene just screamed out Terminator and funny enough the plot seems to scream also. The last hour dragged. All you get is shooting, rest, back to shooting, attempts to get us like the characters, dialogue that oozes cheese and then the Almighty conclusion.Nothing made sense in this film. Charlie, who carried the future man to save mankind in here womb ( i know, right ) was so unlikeable that i wouldn't give a damn if the T-1000 just stormed in the diner and stabbed her in the belly. The script was made out of melted cheese with a sprinkle of Parmesan. Terrible film. Only Merit i can give it are the few laughs and the short running time.",Legion
99,chelano,God is evil,3,16 November 2010,"Besides some really cool special effects, this movie was pretty bad. I heard that it was rated horrible because of the whole religious background. Saying that God is tired of humans so he basically wants to kill them all off. That angels are bad and he also controls demons. So I had to watch this. I love movies that push the limits. But when it was over, I realized it was not the background making the film bad, but the story itself. It was all over the place and just ended to sudden, you would think it was a joke. Some of the cast was OK, others I feel sorry for. Dennis Quaid has a horrible character and did not really get into it. It seemed like a joke. The girl that the movie was based around is Adrianne Palicki. Not a great choice for a main character. The only guy I really enjoyed watching was Kevin Durand who played Gabriel. If I was to think of an evil angel for Gabriel, Durand had the look and the voice for the part. Now Paul Bettany played Michael and he looked and sounded the part also. But he came off a little wimpy. I really wanted to see some cool fighting with him. I got one good scene and that was it. The film again had some interesting scenes that were both cool looking and even a bit scary. But that did not help make me enjoy this film when it was over.",Legion

Most of the actors seemed disinterested and looked as if they did this for a quick buck. There were some pretty cinematographic shots of the desert landscape and sky, and the best part is the beginning where the setup of the movie takes place, when some random people are gathering at an isolated gas station with some good banter and interesting characters. But when the main plot gets underway it all goes rapidly downhill.

The plot is simple, but wants set the attention about the life value, a value which seems to be despised in the relativism and hopeless of what we commonly call ""modernity"". The movie says that the comfortably egoism gives illusion of freedom, but makes people incapacitated to show love, making them suspicious, individualistic in continue familiar conflict. It will be a challenge for human beings but also for angels: ""love is hard but possible for people choosing to have faith in it, and could became a challenge also for angels"".

Sure it's not the brightest movie and is very predictable but saying it's boring with bad acting and calling it the worst movie of the year as some people are claiming, NO WAY! I've seen way worse movies out there with bad acting like the other religious themed horror movie House, now that one sucked and was a snoozefest. The acting in this film isn't the best ever but it isn't horrible as people are saying and at least they make it interesting and fun in a late night grindhouse flick sort of way and that's fine by me because it didn't bore me but I have to say that it has a pretty random cast of stars in this movie. This was pretty graphic and violent at times but it wasn't as gory as I thought it would be and it was almost more of a action flick than anything but there was some fun, creepy and wacky scenes here and there. My one complaint is that there was too much dialogue and jibber jabbing between scenes and not enough demon attacks and it could of had a better conclusion. Overall it moved at a fast enough pace, was fun and entertaining with a likable yet random cast, had enough action and thrills and at parts was goofy and funny, not one dull moment for me and what else could you want and expect from a movie especially like this one, definitely not the atrocious, dull movie I was expecting.

107,evan_harvey,"So, so tragically bad",1,16 May 2010,"Summary: It sucked.Here's why: a bunch of people in a diner are fighting hordes of angels? Well, okay, I guess. However, you'll note that by an hour in they've only fought off 1 horde, and the rest of time has been dialogue scenes that don't advance the story at all. The whole film could have wrapped up in about 30 minutes if they'd ditched the incredibly boring and pointless talk fest. I was at least hoping for extended scenes of fighting and whatnot, but they're so few and far between that you'd think you're watching a drama movie as opposed to a fantasy action flick.Second, the story is so lame it's almost laughable. God decides that he wants to kill everyone, so he send angels to do it??? Okay, so God killed everyone with the flood way back when, but at least that had a point - everyone was wicked, but he saved Noah and his family so they could begin again. This time, he wants everyone gone. So an angel decides to disobey him and save a newborn baby, who will supposedly save mankind, although it never really says why the baby will do so.I suppose that the writer was trying to put a new twist on it all, but it suffers from making God out to be a distant and unseen being whose relationship to man is more akin to Greek Mythology than Christianity, despite drawing all it's symbolism from Christianity.Then! the disobedient angel isn't actually punished for disobeying God, but is brought back to life because the angel gave God what he needed, not what he wanted! Well, why not put him in charge, as he knows better than God! It's such a confused mess of Christian mish-mash that it doesn't really know which way to turn.So. Confused plot. No actual theme. Poorly scripted pace with only occasional action. Poorly written script. Bad acting. Hordes of people possessed by angels (I wasn't aware that angels actually possessed people) who are trying to kill the baby but don't really put any effort into it. No atmosphere.

Also, the fact that Jesus is part of the Trinity (he IS GOD) the idea that ""God"" would want to stop Jesus' second mission is absurd. They are ONE GOD, one being in 3 persons.

When of course a logical theme was never a requirement for a solid movie anyway. Yes, 'Legion' is somewhat cheesy. Yes, it's a tad silly to watch an angel duke it out with a high-tech spinning wrist blade. Nonetheless. This film is far, far better than reviews would have you think. It has a decent pace, it has very respectable performances across the board, and the writing is NOT awful. I have heard much, much worse in movies far more greatly praised. Actually, I'd venture to suggest that most of the hate flying around over this is actually due to that anti-Oprah premise, that God is rather fed up with us all. Makes perfect sense to me. But I think the concept - which, yes, is cheesily used to drive this movie machine - so irks people that they must dismiss the movie as trash.

What did you expect?,6,29 April 2010,"Yes, it sucks on many points like hell. the character development is kindergarten level and though the cast is actually quite well arranged and potent enough to pull this thing off, the acting sucks for some reason most of the time and there are a few rather awful moments regarding that. Most of the dialog isn't good either, so not like there would have been anything to work with. The story is very simple, the script is full of plot holes and a lot of stuff goes nowhere. Short: there is B-movie written all over this thing. If you like the classic B- movie-action-horror-flick, you have a good chance of loving this for it's surprisingly good moments, like some of the action but also the monologues of Dutton and Bettany for example, which I found - though simple - very good as some other plain but effective lines. The pacing works, the action is cool, especially when it gets really started around the last 30-40 minutes and I need to emphasize the fact how good this movie looks, meaning not just the CGI, but also the cutting-edge cinematography. Enter it having no expectations and suddenly find yourself having a lot of fun.Just one word about the ""controversy"" that some people have pointed out. Legion plays in Lalalala-land, where god has a fortress in the sky where he lives with his angels, who are tattooed sword fighters in black armor. For all the christians out there, who are not up to the task, to distinguish fantasy from reality: please leave it free for other people to do so.

112,CelluloidDog,"Underrated, Misunderstood Film...maybe hard to get it",7,17 May 2010,"I don't generally review horror movies but I feel there is injustice done to this film (so I'm playing the role of Michael against Gabriel and the army of angels). Most reviewers miss the boat on this movie. And missing the boat is easy, since the producers gave the wrong port. Read and you'll get what I mean.Poor reviews and the box office failure spell doom. The major problem of this movie is that it sold itself differently, like Tiger Woods (lol). Many write they can't believe angels being bad or it was a boring apocalyptic movie. Most people going to see this B-movie are going for the thrills and horrors. We all have our biases and most people think of angels as good and demons as bad. This movie is different and challenges perceptions.The plot is a movie of a heavenly battle to bring down mankind. It's not unGod-like as many people say. It happens frequently in the Old Testament...such as Sodom and Gomorrah. The Old Testament Jehovah is a jealous God with emotions. This is not His first time in human disappointment. Michael and Gabriel are warrior-like angels. It seems many reviewers have some difficulty comprehending Michael going against God. (religious reviewers find this hard to swallow and non-religious reviewers find it nonsense...I'm taking a neutral approach and looking at historical depictions of angels). Keep in mind, Lucifer was also an angel. Historically Michael is often depicted holding an unsheathed sword and is the defender of Israel against other angels (e.g., Samael). In this case, he battles against Gabriel. The historically depicted Michael represents all that is kind in God. He was the best choice as the defender of the hopelessly lost (at the diner). Someone commented how could Michael kill the two cops? Well, he didn't. One cop was possessed by an angel and shot the other cop. Michael killed the angel. In Hebrew literature, Michael does battle other angels. Gabriel is God's messenger. So if God wants destruction, he will call upon Gabriel to lead. In fact, the Apocalypse is often depicted as being led by Gabriel who blows a trumpet. Other movies such as The Prophecy with Christopher Walken actually depict Gabriel less accurately as a evil-doing angel. Gabriel is only sometimes depicted as a warrior as John Milton did in Paradise Lost (Gabriel as the Captain of Heaven's Guards). (One reviewer incorrectly mentioned Gabriel is never a warrior). In essence, we see an Old Testament version of God and angels...which is not most people's perception.The diner has plenty of lost ""souls."" It represents a Pugatorial station on Earth. Nothing fun about it. But a great setting to develop the characters for this movie. We see a dysfunction family with the parents fighting and the daughter flaunting. (Nothing new). Bob Hanson, the owner of the diner played by Dennis Quaid is a bit of a loser...and so it everyone else there. Kyle, played by Tyrese Gibson, is divorced and on his way to get custody of his son. He is also armed and not quite friendly. So no one at the diner appears to really be ""good"" or worth saving. Even Charlie (played by Adrianne Palicki) who is pregnant with a child we don't know whose father it was. That sounds like the New Testaments, right? So perhaps she is a Mary figure.Personally I didn't like Jeep (played by Lucas Black) who is a simple character faithful to Charlie and his father. We realize he is the ""good' character that Michael keeps faith in. This movie relies on keeping simple characters, all with human flaws. But in a horror movie, it is the standard not to develop the characters too much (with some exceptions like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens).The script is actually very good. And most of the acting led by Paul Bettany Dennis Quaid, and Charles Dutton is mostly strong. Most of the movie is spent in the diner with dialogue and character development. The second half is shoot 'em up but by then, if the crowd is looking for a B movie, this isn't quite it.If you take the movie for what it really is, it is superior to most Zombie or apocalyptic movies. Compare for example, ""I am Legend"" which really has a weaker script and plot but people love Will Smith so it gets favorable reviews. Or everyone's favorite: ""Terminator"" which really is a B-movie since the script and acting is bad....but it's a cult classic! ""Legion"" has as good acting as ""30 Days of Night"" with a better script. ""30 Days of Nights"" is more fun, however...and ""Legion"" has its fun in the grandma scene, the ice cream man or the kid in the car (trap).Two other things I thought were problems: was why not bring Charlie and the rest of the defenseless up to the roof? That was safer. The 2004 film ""Dawn of the Dead"" which was also well-acted (maybe the best zombie film). Near the end, everyone is on the roof (there's an army on the ground. And then the rollover, the baby survived that? But it is hard to believe that Dawn of the Dead got a 7.4 and this movie only got a 5.0.Legion should have been made with less CGI, less action and marketed differently. Then it might have appealed to a more intelligent, smaller market. Or make the script dumber, characters weaker, and lots and lots of action and you might get a higher IMDb popular rating.

115,moonmonday,Believe in White Trash,2,5 October 2010,"The Judeo-Christian pantheon has always been a particularly interesting one, but due to the overwhelming religious bias of much of the United States, Hollywood tends to shy away from any real exploration of the potential. That is, unless it can be exploited shamelessly as in travesties like The Passion of the Christ and its ilk, which tend to miss the point, or neo-atheist drivel using the mythology as window-dressing.Legion was one of those films that was probably well-intentioned, but which managed to fail more or less completely at its intention. The story is basically interesting, but it overstays its welcome and manages to accomplish almost nothing. None of the characters are compelling, least of all Michael, who is supposed to be the hero of the piece. He barely rolls into the film at one third of the way through and fails to make any sort of impression. He does absolutely nothing worthwhile except to pad the film. And despite the clear attempt to set him up as the mysterious hero, he's neither heroic nor mysterious, nor is he at all sympathetic.The characters end up being nothing but body counts so that Michael can look cool and detached. Nothing in the film has a logical flow, and no-one seems to use any actual rational thought at any given time. Jeep, an unfortunately-named young man played heavily as a retardate, is supposedly the reason why Michael still believes in humanity, yet no real strength is given to his character, who is relegated firmly to the background throughout the whole film. The barely-developed black men are inserted to give curiously similar life lessons the writers apparently thought would be poignant, and soon after they were each killed off ignominiously.Everything in the film has a 'who cares?' vibe to it, which isn't helped by the disjointed story. The way the film presents it, God is a drama queen in a polyamorous gay relationship whom Michael intends to give what he needs rather than wants. It gives the whole thing a sort of cheapness, and it really doesn't reflect much of anything in terms of the dynamic of the mythology. For example, there are clear references to elements, such as Michael bowing before humanity as God's beloved creation, and yet somehow the whole story of Lucifer's famous disagreement with him is glossed over, as if Michael were the first and only ever to disobey an order.There is also no real justification for Michael cutting off his wings and this apparently making him just like anyone else, nor is it ever adequately addressed in the course of the film. Additionally, despite the promotional poster being a shirtless Michael with intricate tattooing all over his chest, the single moment of being able to see these tattoos occurs in the span of about ten seconds at the beginning of the film.This of course has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film or any of the characters in it.There are elements of ostentatious pretentiousness, such as the diner being named the Paradise Diner; it seems like no filmmaker can ever avoid self-important attempts at irony. Due to a tiny budget, most of the film's action takes place at the Paradise, and with a minuscule cast of characters assembled there.Limited setting is a really fantastic opportunity to present a gripping, suspenseful narrative. Sapphire and Steel famously used a small budget and a single setting for more or less each and every story of that series. However, this story was not even near suspenseful. To be that, it would have to make the audience care about the characters, which is its greatest failing.Not a single character does anything to make himself or herself sympathetic or likable. The best they get is Dennis Quaid's, who simply elicits pity due to the fact that even his 'cool moment' is ruined by a film that doesn't know when to just stop. He's far too good an actor to have been in this, and he's given nothing to do with a dead-end part that is just as meaningless as the rest of the cast.People keep saying to believe throughout this film, but believe in what exactly they never are clear. Believe in the white trash heroes, I suppose, or what are left as heroes since everyone else gets shuffled off the screen disgracefully without making much of an impact. The one character who actually stretches at all gets unceremoniously blown away by Michael for no real reason. The waitress, who is supposedly the mother of the saviour of humanity's future, does one meaningful thing during the film that is too little, too late, and almost immediately rendered completely meaningless.The story isn't creepy or impacting or interesting, it's just sad and pitiable and inane. Nothing means anything in the course of the tale, not a single thing done accomplishes anything, and ultimately at the end the viewer is left wondering...believe in what, exactly? Because the story clearly wants to encourage belief in something. Who knows though, since it begins and ends on the same note, and doesn't actually do so in a poignant manner. If you're going to repeat the intro at the end, it should have some meaning added in the course of the film's events, but here it isn't. It's just repeated and meaningless. It takes away from what little impact the whole thing had.Basically, and at its root, Legion is a badly-realised attempt at a 'apocalypse siege' film. It might have done better as a 15-minute short film, but it never decides what it is trying to do, and so it never does it. The title is also misleading, since Legion was a multitudinous demon, not angels.This film is just an exercise in futility, most of all for the viewer. There are many other, better ways to waste almost two hours.",Legion

117,blackmambamark,Wait a minute? Michael Bay didn't direct this? That's surprising.,5,24 January 2010,"How many movies do we really have about angels? Well if you can name a few, i bet they don't involve them using machine guns and waging war on mankind. Needless to say, the movie itself doesn't sound that appealing to me.......maybe on a 'Drive In' movie basis, but nothing that can be taken that seriously. The phrase ""Half Cooked"" comes to mind when i think of this story. It was very conflicting, and really didn't make sense at all. When it comes to a story like this, you really need a lot of depth. Because lets face it, the basis of your movie is something that almost everyone on earth is familiar with......no matter what religion you believe in. But they try to sum up everything that made no sense with the phrase ""Dont believe everything you have been told"".......yeah, real original. Your meaning to tell me that 5 hoosiers and 1 fallen angel can stand up to the wrath of god and an army of angels? Yeah, im sorry, but im going to believe everything i know. Not only that, the little demon creatures that you see in the previews......yeah, they are not demons.....they are actually humans being possessed by angels. Which im sorry, i think that was a little dumb on the writers part. And to be honest, the writter made numerous flaws in this script. Yeah sure, the idea might pass if you present it in the right fashion.......but rather than go for credit points with its in-depth story and dialogue........it traded that in for okay action sequences, mediocre acting, pittifull dialogue, and a conflicting storyline that is filled so many holes. Bottom Line.......the best way i can describe this movie is this.......i think the writter and director watched way too many Michael Bay movies before they made this film. It's cheese, laced together with a half cooked story and horrible dialogue, and it tries to keep your interest with action rather than story......which in this case, is not a good thing. You want a crazy action movie like this? Go and watch one of the hundred zombie flicks that have come out......because believe it or not, they make 100 times more sense, and they are a hundred times more entertaining.

It's low-level entertainment and it fills that role perfectly. Just switch off your brain and enjoy.And don't forget one of the golden rules of cinema: anything with Dennis Quaid in is worth watching for that alone. I found the movie very watchable, not up to the standard of The Prophecy movies but then what angel film is.

But even then its always interesting to see what happens next.From the previews seen from Legion we've already learned that its about God giving up on man and He sends angels to destroy man. So now an angel that does not believe in God's orders goes out to save mankind by protecting a woman who's baby is the only hope mankind has of surviving. The story is very interesting and the cast is perfect for this movie. Before the movie is over it leaves us on a little cliffhanger. Its hard to tell if the ""extermination"" is over or not. But still the battle of Gabriel and Michael is pretty good. Some of the things that happened are definitely leading up to something big.So is this the next big action-apocalypse of the decade probably not. But still a pretty good action film that not all but a lot of movie goers will enjoy.

After that, I got bombarded with conversation fluff, angels with oddly different accents, and a mother more uninteresting than Sarah Connor off of The Terminator.

124,spencerthetracy,A terrific movie with a horrible message,7,22 January 2010,"I gotta tell ya, I really liked this movie. I cringed though and so will you if you have any like or love for God.By now you might know the story. God is really ticked at humankind and he will do anything to destroy us, even use the angels of old to do it. One angel (Michael) refuses to do ""God's Will"" and protects the survivors of the holocaust and the chosen child, ala John Connor.The special effects were spectacular and the acting was almost perfect. I'll give everyone a 8 out of 10. The stand out: Paul Bettany as Michael the Warrior angel. Of course, he takes every role he plays very seriously.More about the message, I can't get over it. I don't think there's anyone that's going to leave the theater and feel very good about what they saw.Horror movies have always done well when they've left God out of it, or questioning his attitudes or views on His chiefest creation.Even The Omen places more focus on the plans of the Evil One and less on God's intentions.I give this a 7 out of 10 for the above reasons. If the plot had been more about the evil of man, anything but making God out to be the bad guy it could've have warranted higher. In a lot of ways this is the opposite of Book of Eli, where God protects those who do His will.Another stand out is Lucas Black. What a joy to see him again. He's grown up well (without his accent being affected) and he's very serious about the craft of acting. And it shows.My suggestion: see it.",Legion

Quaid isn't on his best form but he still delivers an entertaining performance. The rest of the cast fill their roles equally well, and Kevin Durrands Gabriel is an unexpected stand out role.This is a film best enjoyed from your couch with the lights down, popcorn in hand and your other half at your side.I'm glad this film made its way to Netflix.

The music and effects noises were at near-painful levels at all times, while the actors spent a good 75 percent of screen-time either whispering or seemingly mumbling. The next problem I had with it is that the film was almost too dark to see anything when the most important things were going on.

OK, but what doesn't make sense is why are the people possessed by angels acting like demons and the whole concept of flies which are usually associated with demons? I honestly thought this was a very strange idea. Also what was so special about this pregnant women and her soon to be born child? The baby certainly not the second coming of Jesus.Now what the movie did good on, the action scenes were actually quite good, sure there was some drama going on but thankfully it didn't drag on and to be honest I think the movie did fairly well for an action fantasy film.Overall, even though the story had me really lost and confused but at least the movie tried to be a fairly alright action film despite just being a typical mediocre film.",Legion

And how come when the baby was born, they still had to fight even after Michael came back as an angel? Sort of thought the whole point of the sacrifice he made was to give God hope again. Which again, is not a great plot line since God is the source of all love but I digress. Interesting things to think about if you can ignore the major theological issues there are here.But also it was just scary to be scary and gross to be gross during certain parts which I'm never a fan of.

132,sixbells99,A bad film but does have some entertainment value,5,17 July 2010,"Lets get right to it, this is a bad film, the angels are deft hands with submachine guns, rocket launchers and their own weapon of choice a rotating angel axe, which would do a good job of sanding down your old wooden door. The writers seem to have raided a script store and taken scenes from about 20 different films, hoping nobody would notice when they are all put together.Yet through this dense jungle of sheer movie awfulness some sunlight squeezes through and we get occasional glimpses of the blue sky above. Dennis Quaid plays a gaunt haggard old man owner of a run down grease pit of a restaurant in the middle of the desert. The character and his circumstances seem to painfully mirror Quaids own life and you wonder how much he is actually acting. But none the less he holds the film up from oblivion giving a competent performance. As for Paul Bettany he goes at each line which such passion and energy you would think the director fooled him into thinking he was making a lost Shakespearian play. But his 80's petshop boys collarless jacket is unforgivable.One of the most entertaining aspects of this film is how oblivious the actors are to how bad the script is. They go at each scene as if it is has Oscar wining potential. They pour out their hearts and souls to dialogue that would be too cheesy in a daytime soap. It's the fact that the director, actors and the FX department are so committed to this film that you can come away with some entertainment value. There are some good action set pieces; however the best two have criminally be used in the trailer, diluting their impact. You have some good actors, although mixed with some more wooden that an oak tree. The religious aspect of turning angels into commandos with weapons skills that would put a navy seal to shame is going to be in poor taste to some. To sum up it's a bad film but does have some entertainment value, not a film I would ever recommend paying to see, but might not be a bad choice on a late night when nothing else is on.",Legion

Expecting great things and getting nothing but a muddled story, ridiculous plot and a screenplay written by someone with very little spiritual understanding.Tempting as it is i shall avoid the theology lessons and just talk about the film.The film has an abundance of serious flaws that ruin it from misguided Biblical interpretation to poor continuity, diabolical acting and ... so on and so on. The action scenes are minimal, telegraphed and not properly delt with. The characters are so uninteresting, two-dimensional and pathetic that you simply just don't care if they live or die.The script is weak, the plot full of holes and contradictions and scenes involving mortal men shooting bullets at eternal Angels are so bad it's laughable, when it's actually supposed to be serious. Here's the thing if they'd just gone that step further and intentionally made a bad B-movie that you could laugh at ( i.e Evil Dead) fine, but Legion takes itself too serious and so therefore you don't laugh at the laughable as it all seems just pathetic. If you compare it to Dogma as a comedic narrative with a moral theological plot then it fails to make you laugh as Dogma did, compare it to Fallen with its deep spiritual and demonic thread then the film fails, compare it to Evil Dead well it just fails again. This movie then, fails on every level and it just drags on and on. There's no explanaition as to why this baby in this town makes any difference but honestly by the time you get to that part you're so sick of this rubbish film you really really really don't care.Thinking that Legion needed to be seen in all it's glory on the big screen, It was the first time I have actually been angry that I didn't wait for the DVD. there was one good part, it ended.

Then it turned out these possessions were not demonic but ""angelic"". That doesn't make much sense to begin with. Later another angel arrives this time flesh and blood??? So what's the deal are they corporeal or not? Apparently somewhere in between? Why do they possess people and not just come down in their own bodies? Where does that leave demons? I expected a full out war between heaven and hell with battles maybe a bit like the ones in Return of the Mummy. Humanity caught in the middle. But no it turn out god decided to send a cleanup crew down to earth instead.The angel Michael who wants to save this baby for some reason doesn't want to explain anything most of the time. He just stands there remaining silent wanting to explain things but can't because it isn't in the script.If it wasn't for the reasonable effects and action scenes the movie would be unwatchable but these are the plusses of the movie making it worth watching when it gets aired on TV or when you can grab a copy out of one of those DVD discount bins for a few bucks.",Legion

It ends like Terminator, Sarah Connor's bandanna included. And maybe even the guns in the back of the car. Several scenes cry out Matrix reference, but hey, it's almost a must. Besides, Matrix fan here, so I guess this could be a biased perception. The first half of the movie looks like an imitation of 'Constantine'. Francis Lawrence and his director of photography ( one Philippe Rousellot) should be proud. I guess. Heck, even Connie's lighter makes a cameo appearance in this film ! Then it's all a messed-up mix of various references. Matrix, The Seventh Sign (1988) Jet Li movies, you name it. Okay, I know it's a post-post-modern world out there. But there's a fine line between ( close) references or homage and heavy borrowing. And when I hear lines like "" Why do you continue to fight? When you know all hope is lost?"" and the hero's answer is 'Fuck you"", my mind stops – and then in a split second pulls out of the archive the 'Oh! In two hundred years we've gone from ""I regret but I have one life to give for my country"" to ""Fuck you!""?  I'm glad Neo isn't alive anymore to hear this. :( And the above reaction/analysis could mean several things. One is that I should stop watching movies in Keanu Reeves movies terms. ( Although it's hard to see how this could be done, as, to quote a friend, I've got Connie engraved on my brain cells. ) . The other, far more disturbing , is that I've fallen into the (amateur) film critic's mind set. Which is something I promised myself – ever since listening to the film critics' commentary to the Matrix movies ( shrewd, the Wachowskis are ) - to never let happen. Begone, Satan ! Stop. Replay. The movie, I mean.  and I still see all the above. But I like the idea of Michael being the rebellious one. To quote my friend ( again), ""Gabriel is the decision maker, Michael the warrior.[] decision makers learn not to second guess themselves - warriors just carry out the judgments [] which means that the warrior can take a moment to think it over - and second guess.."" I wish the moviemaker would have played with this idea more. Instead, we're given action scenes over action scenes and just a ""You gave him what he asked. I gave him what he needed"" line. And Michael's little chat with Jeep in the still of the night. But I wanted more talk and less fighting. More food for thought and less action scenes. In the same time, a comment on these pages says : ""Jet Li movies have a lot more ""kung fu"". In fact, so does The Matrix, and that also has gun-fu."" (KentaroK) I had to smile.

It reminds me of Dust Til Dawn in the set-up of the main action scenes. It reminds me of the Exorcist or Constantine in the use of Occult and Orothodox, Universal (i.e. Cat-hol-i-c) rites.However, it fails to capitalize on any of this.Prophecy has a much better story, much better drama, much better characters, and much more involved and self-consistent plot.Matrix has more action. That's The Matrix (1999), not even touching on the other movies, or on something like Storm Riders.The Crow has a better hero/anti-hero.Jet Li movies have a lot more ""kung fu"".

It totally changed gears.Once the film first set-piece ended it turned into a slower version of Night of the Living Dead. This is largely due to a plot point that set this rule into action: God put a restraining order on all ZombAngels. They were not allowed to get too close to the main protagonist. So without giving anything away; you can now imagine the pacing of the film up to the climax. Slow and uneventful.The acting was a caliber above most Horror films. Quaid, Black, and Bettany were all fine. However none were memorable. Even the two main Godsends, Gabriel and Michael, managed to have conflict that was forgotten seconds after the next scene started.So I would say it's a ""Catch on Cable"" viewing.

The first sequence of scenes sets up an awesome scenario that the second two acts fails to convert upon, and it saddens me to think what could have been.I love the idea of God turning on his prized creations, which directly contradicts gods gift of free will so I think this is a really cool Idea that Scott Stewart chose to explore with this film. He brings an interesting depth to the moral discussion of free will when he brings a angel who enacts his own free will trying to save humanity from the apocalypse. I think this allowed for a rather deep examination of how we as humans choose to spreed our humanity, and the lack of compassion that we often display, but I digress.I give this movie a 6/10 because despite its inability to keep the viewers attention it still was able to deliver some good key moments.",Legion

He's here to protect the, um, is it the second coming? Well, the movie never says, actually. It also never mentions virgin birth...i figured they would, but it never did. So, I am not sure if the child the angel is protecting is Jesus redux, or just another ""only hope for all humanity."" Seems the director didn't want to commit to naming him Jesus. Anyways, the anguish of his choice, the disappointment in turning from God, his narrow hope in humanity...all meaty subjects in a vegetarian movie. And, what did they do with it? Um. Nothing, really. They turned it into a Alamo (not even a good alamo...a diner? I can get in there!) with the outnumbered diners facing the wrath of heaven. Which never gets really nasty. Or smart. There are a couple of plot holes that are just so glaring...See, the angels can possess a human for a while. So, early in the movie, hundreds of possessed humans arrive at the diner. Hmmm. The movie said weak minds were in danger of being possessed. So...i guess I have to believe that the diner was filled with Mensa members? All the angels had to do was possess a couple of inside workers and they would have wrapped this adventure up in record time. Still..i like the angel Michael. If you are a bettany fan, watch it for him. Otherwise, wait for the book. You can at least burn the book.",Legion
148,psynet-commander,Michael defied God for this?,2,3 April 2019,"Apocalypse is coming because God has no faith left in humans.Yep, it's God that has no faith. Humans were doing just peachy with their faith and God, all of a sudden, lost faith. It's all God's fault.Well, following that, naturally, God tells his workers, the angels, to go and eradicate all humans, once again.
(Note: the great flood being the first round of cleanup)However, the leader of angels, Michael, decides that God couldn't really mean to destroy mankind so he decids to defy God and save humanity all by himself.Back on Earth, the sky begins to fill with all these glowing beings of light with wings, throwing down lightning bolts on the ground and with each attack wiping out entire cities. In about less than 15 minutes the whole earth is as clean as the aliens in 'The Day the Earth Stood Still' wanted it to be.That's what you'd expect to see if angels came to exterminate humans but not in this classy tale. Here our angels give up most of their special powers (except for biting and climbing walls), downgrade themselves to humans (homeless and gangsters no less), drive hundreds of miles and attack using conventional weapons (Weapons of Mass Destruction were probably not allowed under the Genesis Convention).Apparently when angels take human form, they either turn to zombies, jerks, morons or gangsters. Not very classy behavioral choices but they did have excellent wardrobe choices for an apocalyptic war. I can only imagine what their 'Project Runway' must look like.Angel Michael is severely lacking in the biting and climbing walls skill categories but he does have one thing going for him. He knows about weapons - which all the others angels, somehow, missed.As for the humans Michael is trying to save, they are the lot that deserves to be killed first and foremost. I kept wondering, ""Michael defied God for this?""",Legion
149,thefinisher_23,Bring up at your bible study this week...lemme know what happens,6,24 January 2010,"Is it blasphemous to describe a film in which a Christian God decides to usher in the end of days as being sort of, you knowfun? Fear not omnipotent deities, Scott Stewart's Legion isn't really that good but I'd be lying to if I said a part of me didn't enjoy the campy action/scares, the deep cast, and the back and forth between two Archangels. Amongst all these positives though there is one underlying truth here, this plot is a mess and a half. In a film where dialogue is at a surplus for our band of survivors both human and divine, you would think a lot more time could have been spent on the motivation of the God in question.For those frequent and veteran moviegoers out there you will certainly recognize some obvious Terminator parallels. Not necessarily in plot but in some key scenes. Our protagonist Michael (Paul Bettanytypically commanding here as he usually is) arrives in a dark L.A. alley at the film's start. After his intro we get to know Paradise Falls (obvious no?), which is a diner out in the middle of New Mexico. Here resides Charlie (Adrianne Palicki) who is pregnant with Jesus: The Sequel. She is accompanied by Jeep (Lucas Blackand yes he does have deep Southern accent; what 'Jeep' didn't give it away?) who is truly smitten with her even though the child isn't his and nor is Charlie. Jeep's dad is Bob (Dennis Quaid, who puts his accent on a little easier) who co-owns the diner with Percy (Charles S. Dutton). The two men are a contrast of one another. Percy is upbeat and is a believer. Bob is an aging cynic who doesn't even bother with a possibility of a higher being. They are joined by a snobby family (Jon Tenney as dad, Willa Holland as the immature daughter and Kate Walsh who seems to have fun as soon-to-be out of her mind mother), and lastly by hard ass Kyle Williams (Tyrese Gibson, who adds attitude to any picture he is in). All have no idea what they are in for. A possessed Golden girl gives them quite an idea.The real success of a film like this hinges on the ability to balance campy with chills. We may smirk at the idea of a grandma cursing her head off and taking a chunk out of a cast member or two. However we also might have the hair on our necks stand up at the idea of a possessed toddler attempting off our supposed savior. The Casting director deserves a bonus. In the hands of lesser actors this probably would be straight-to-DVD. I suppose that is because of how miserably the plot fails here both in the common sense and biblical departments. If God really wanted to 'Noah' us all again would he not have simply sent all the angels down to do the job, instead of having them possess humans who can be killed like zombies? Or can the angels only come down through a human? How come Gabriel can come down from the heavens wielding one hell of a hurt stick? The film doesn't answer. Nor exactly does it answer why God's breaking point came at this point in time. Normally I would pass this off as movie logic but I just so happen to attend church. I'm no adamant disciple but I know enough, or perhaps believe enough, to say that the logic and ideology here needs to be explained because it is simply unbelievable.Redeeming the film of this flaw is Bettany and the relationship between his Michael and Gabriel (Kevin Durand, please give him a full role Hollywood). Bettany's characters command our attention with their confidence and tenacity. Michael is no different. Thankfully he doesn't get bogged down in too proclamation. He knows what he believes he must do and he does believe in it. The exchange between him and Jeep is perhaps the film's best. Gabriel is his foil, a noble soldier and that is it. He too has belief in his commander. Despite the vast storytelling shortcomings these two give the movie some serious credibility. The performance of Palicki is good in its short supply. She simply doesn't want this, and her immaturity to begin with is surprisingly real.There is a lot to consider when watching any film where a specific religion is the focal point. Legion doesn't ask us to check our beliefs at the door, but it still sorely fails at giving us the depth we need in regard to its source material which will seriously turn some of its audience off regardless of how they spend their Sundays. Thankfully the cast provides some likability, and the action provides the thrills. At the end of it all though conflicted and unintrigued the best words to describe Legion. I think the cast and crew were aiming for 'entertaining.'",Legion
150,chris-bushwacker,Great Fun,7,5 March 2011,"Depending on what you expect, you might think this is a waste of time (as another reviewer did, who compared it unfavourably with The Prophecy, starring Christopher Walken) or you might just decide to suspend those expectations and see what transpires. Personally, I thought The Prophecy was a massive pile of crap, even laughably bad. By contrast, Legion has its laughs too, though in this case they are tongue in cheek and deliberately amusing. My favourite line came from the character who, when asked ""Where did the flies go?"" responds with an exasperated ""I don't know - you're asking me to explain the behaviour of a mother-f***ing pestilence!""This film has the usual portentous end of the world prophesying, but it is laced with good humour, silly shocks, explosions and shoot-outs, acrobatic kung-fu-type fights between warring Angels, and a cast of characters who behave according to character, rather than obliging with the kind of nonsensical behaviour demanded of characters in horror/slasher films where the dwindling cast gets picked off one by one due to their irrational decisions.This film is great fun, and though played straight by the actors, provides an amusing and entertaining 100 mins. If you don't approach it as a critic, you will enjoy it.",Legion
151,nintendofanof1993,A big let down.,6,13 February 2011,"Legion brings forth a somewhat new perspective. Its setting is in a somewhat post apocalyptic era in which the city is deserted and little to no people are out. However a cop just happens to be on patrol and the story begins when he is possessed by ""God' apparently. The angel Gabriel chooses to break away from God. The basic run down of the story is that an angel, who leaves the side of God because he has a plan to wipe out the human race due to his resentment for his own creation. A savior is born however, the very angels that God sends possess the humans and their sole mission is to kill this pregnant woman and her baby so that the human race is destroyed. The plot is quite interesting but overall this film just does not deliver. The trailers for this movie basically showed all of the action within the entire movie. It leaves you feeling cheated, the whole movie is just talk that can get somewhat confusing if you don't pay close attention to it. The action scenes however are very impressive, my favorite part within the whole film is when the ice cream truck approaches the diner, and steps out and his arms and legs grow double their length and he attacks the stragglers. But this is ultimately cut short when he is shot, guesstimating his entire screen time was about 60-90 seconds which was a big let down. As the movie progresses you begin to think which isn't at all good. The movie just leaves your mind plenty of time to wander when it should be focusing on the movie. Towards the end of the movie, all of the characters that the typical movie viewer would become attached to die. This movie just continues to annoy you, but the actions scenes and creative plot line is really what gave this movie a 70% Overall if you have some time on your hands, and you want to see a decent movie this is probably the movie you're looking for.",Legion
152,minorxml,Just boring,4,22 June 2010,"Lets begin shall we? The hurting must begin somewhere. Right Legion is obviously an apocalyptic story based upon the Christian idea of Armageddon. There are worse ideas and it could make a decent movie. But it doesn't. It is boring with lots of talking that doesn't gets anything done. Except maybe just to show there was supposed to be a plot. Okay so the plot here we go seemingly the Christian creator god has given up on the world. And lets be fair why not? So far I can accept that hey it is different then ""Satan did it"". And there is one again without wings for some reason who finds himself at a local dinner/bar/truckstop hey it is a dark dirty place. Outside it is supposed to be ""dangerous"" but why? Oh yes the new Christ is being reborn really? And guess one the pregnant lady here is the mother of oh geesh! What? WHY! Are you doubting the intelligence of the viewers? The reason we know this is because .. it is all spoken out. Yes this movie explains everything to us because we are stupid. Oh well back to the story the demons and Satan aren't there for some reason. Probably hired by a better movie but oh no it are the good angels who will destroy everybody. Seriously .. again this is what they expect us to accept. Sure the story is a bit different like as in totally what the f&*k? Before I foam at my mouth and try to wash it away with Manos the hands of fate I will go somewhere safer. The characters I didn't care about them at all. Now I am not a Christian but even I can like a good told story. Even I can like a good plot even if it is overly Christian. Sure we see the child and well all kind of crazy stuff happening around that time. Think dark wearing angels ""I am evil"" against the one good protecting one ""I wear white"". Yes a duel between two angels and it is boring. It is hard to to find good in this movie I mean the framing of the shots is done fine. There is quality and even an apocalyptic feel to this movie. It has some half decent actors though I smell on them ""made for television."" The sound is decent the locations well there are to few. This is not the worst movie I seen again I seen Manos and Red Zone Cuba, I am a MST3K fan! But it has the most deadly of all movie sins it doesn't entertains. This movie scents of direct to cable/ direct to DVD. No questions asked this is one of those totally unsatisfying experiences. This movie won't make it in the ""so bad it is good"" no it is ""So bad it is boring""And that is just terrible.. it didn't even entertain. It made me mad in that it whoever watches it will feel as if they are seen are a mindless dribbling child. And the action scenes aren't making that worth it.Walk away don't want this movie let it sink deep into the realm of movies forgotten by time.

153,Strawberry_Typhoon,Cheesy dialog during forced character background scenes fill up 3/4ths of the film.,2,22 January 2010,"If Feast, and Splinter have shown us anything, is that sometimes the claustrophobic feeling of a close quarters set can almost be an extra character in the film. Legion went for this, but failed. After seeing the trailers, I was hoping Legion would kickstart 2010's horror'ish lineup into full gear. I couldn't have been more wrong.Legion is the holy roller's rendition of ""The Terminator"" mixing elements of classics from almost every genre of film. Sometimes, a film can pay homage to cult classics, and give birth to an all new sub-genre. Legion is more like an abortion than a birth.Cheesy dialog during forced character background scenes fill up 3/4ths of the film. The action scenes are few and far between, and what little we are given, is very anti-climactic. From the trailer, we were all but promised plenty of zombie-like scenes of innocent people being possessed by angelic forces to facilitate the extermination of the human race. If this is what you're expecting.. don't. 90% of the ""cool"" scenes of possession are shown in the trailer, the rest are pretty much forgettable.Having not seen ""Daybreakers"" yet, so far my 2010 has begun with a dud. Legion is insulting to the viewers intelligence. Save the cash, and wait for this turd to show up late night on the syfy channel.",Legion
154,Seagalogist,'Legion' tries to do too much and falls flat,4,8 March 2010,"I just got back from watching Legion. I knew going in there that the reviews were awful, but I still fancied giving it a real chance. So we start with many non-sensical scenes. One of Michael (Paul Bettany) just prodding around what we later assume (if one even cares to try and figure out the plot after seeing it) is downtown LA. He cuts the area where his wings were, and sews the wounds up.Tyrese Gibson shows up at a diner and seems very strange, like he's on the run or something, but that's not explained either so who cares. Then there's some talk in the diner, every character gets their chance. Including Dennis Quaid, who obviously thinks the script is garbage and just plays his character comically (to good effect).Some old lady shows up, and from the camera angles and score, we know there is something not quite right. Then crazy stuff happens that isn't really explained, Michael shows up, there's lots of fighting, Gabriel shows up, nothing is explained. Mankind will either live, or die. I found this movie weak on plot, and it's lack of follow through on any of the major plot points is a let down. However, take the whole thing with a pinch of salt, laugh inappropriately and Legion is not all bad. One wonders whether the humour was intentional, but it certainly is there. Legion really is only for those who enjoy to laugh at a ridiculous plot and scenes that are seemingly random. Also, the action isn't half bad, but you really don't root for any of the characters, so it comes down to seeing the best explosions/deaths. 4/10.",Legion

157,cannonclubonline,Clearly Hollywood Has Run Out of Good Material,5,26 October 2010,"Upon viewing this film the first time around, I'm sorry I fell asleep. It just didn't spark my inner interests even though it supposedly had angelic origins.In mulling over in my mind about this film, I really almost didn't get it, although, after a while, I finally got what the director and co-screen-writer was trying to do. It goes something like this. We are soon introduced to a bunch of normal average everyday losers from all walks of life who somehow become totally stranded in the middle of nowhere during the coming of GOD's final judgment. We soon learn that all the common annoyances we normally go through in this world are just as boring and typical as our worst Thanksgiving dinner with our dysfunctional families (analogous to, no pun intended, devils in hell want ice-water). The Paradise Diner is almost like a microcosm of pond scum we all love to try & get out of, mainly speaking. It almost reminds me of where old actors go after they have a couple of decades of wonderful roles and then get caught in a down turn, much like what happened to Michael Gross's popularity when he went from ""Family Matters"" all the way down to a 2nd or 3rd billed actor in Tremors (1990 with Kevin Bacon). As a matter of fact, if you could just subtract the Angels and add the alligator worm creatures, I'd think this film would have done a bit better.I think what really went wrong with this was when they made the story-line centered around GOD's wrath and Angels. Actually I checked out the ratings on IMDb.COM (Internet Movie Database), and with only 3,100 votes Tremors 4 (2004) actually beat out this film receiving only a 5 out of 10 by 0.3 of a point. The actual voting for Legion was 9 times the number, so that's almost the curse of death for a movie to receive that low of a ranking with so many votes. That also says a lot about Michael Gross's acting. Great job Michael, although, I got tired of the Tremor films at about number 2.What chokes this film is only a couple of really noticeable mistakes: 1) After Percy gets bathed in acid, there is a shot where you can clearly see that his back is intact, but after that he falls revealing his shirtless back completely acid burnt with flesh eaten away to the spine.2) Why would we really care at all if the characters were really ragging themselves at all (Jeep) about freezing up & not shooting the old lady? 3) After spending hours of planning with over 20 major stunt drivers, the direction failed to take full advantage of the 18-wheeler with pipes on the back. In my opinion, by not getting the pipes to dump was a budgetary constraint that caused the action in the film to be a tiny bit stale and ineffective.4) The audio was extremely low in places, thus ruining much of the important lines that would have been much more effective had they not been trying to play on any kind of emotional tear-jerking reactions.There were one or two good lines that gave the film much needed value, and it came mostly from Percy Walker coming from Charles S. Dutton. The first was when he told about what his father used to tell him before he went to bed at night. He said, ""If it's your last day on this planet, would you be proud of what you've done in this life?"" The other line is only from memory, however it was something about that he didn't know were Michael was getting his information, but that it definitely was not from the same book he knew. I'll have to applaud those lines. The rest were way too ""Barbie"".",Legion

While watching Legion I was constantly reminded of so many other movies, it's hard to keep track of , they literally used every cliché in the book of clichés. In conclusion, I have to say the possessed granny scene was pretty cool, and the one with the annoying mom getting shut up was also a nice redeeming factor, and even that one reminded me strongly of Stephen King's The Mist.

The pacing is horrendous. The action scenes are few, far between and horribly rushed and the down time in between them slows to a crawl. This time is used for each of the uninteresting, two-dimensional characters to melodramatically shed out stories of their troubled pasts. We just don't care about ANY of them due to minuscule character development and a horrible script.The whole film is terribly written with some questionable scenes that seemed to have been written only for the convenience of the characters. The plot is pretty simple but mostly unexplained and full of holes. SO much is left in the dark and the main point of the film isn't even explained so it's hard to care at all during the supposed dramatic moments.Too much talking and not enough action for it to be a wicked B-movie and the overabundance of melodrama and terrible writing keep it from being a serious, dramatic epic.There are slivers of a good film and some great ideas that occasionally appear and the few, brief action scenes are fairly entertaining, but everything else is so terribly executed that it isn't worth any kind of recommendation.",Legion

And while some bring decent points, there are some 1 starts on here that are silly in their thought process. One in particular touches on killing Howard then bringing him back just to kill him off again, but not being explained, which is blatantly weird since Michael mentioned before hand. This was a test of weakness,.... the woman was weak to wanting her husband back,.... of course they would use this in a fashion to kill some if not all of them.The baby being ""with no injuries whatsoever"" was NEVER actually mentioned in the movie. Jeep asked Charlie ""The baby--?"" ""Alive"" is all the info you get on their well-being.Enough about that,... I merely mentioned them because some of the gripes of the movie were ACTUALLY explained,... but people didn't pay attention and just wanted to ""hate"" on it.The plot is a decent twist on ANGELS being the ""bad guys"" instead of the normal trend of it being the typical demons. A new birth on the night of the apocalypse brings a new set of hope in the eyes of god. At least, that is just an interpretation of it.Acting was adequate,... although ""Jeep""'s accent was GOD awful.Graphics were find for what they were. CGI done neatly when needed, and over the top when it got messy. As one would expect in this type of movie to be honest.Ending..... yeah I'll agree that the ending could've been pushed back another 20-25 minutes to flesh it out. But it looks like the ending was banking on a sequel to continue the story of raising the child.Like the score shows,... not good, not awful,... it just IS. It's a decent watch, and a decent revisit once in a blue moon. But by no means worth gushing over.",Legion
170,sandtonvideo,Holy S#%T!!!!,5,19 October 2010,"LEGION In this horror/action/fantasy, God has apparently gotten ""tired of all the bull*!@t"" (yes, that is really a quote from the movie), and decides to wipe out humanity. One angel, Michael (Paul Bettany), rebels, and comes to earth to protect an unborn baby who somehow holds the key to getting back in God's good books and saving humanity. Said baby is in the womb of a woman working as a waitress in a little diner on the edge of the Mojave desert, and she and a group of people will be trapped in the diner as the Apocalypse is unleashed. So, from the start, there will be those who will be offended by the plot, and they should skip the movie. If you are looking for a mind-bending theological thriller/horror, you can forget that, too: the movie's own internal logic is fuzzy to say the least. What's left is to do an action/special effects movie that concentrates on style over substance, and that it does pretty well. The actors also do an amazing job of selling such a weak storyline and script, with Dennis Quaid and Lucas Black especially good, along with Bettany, but the real stars of this film are the special effects and stunt people. Great effort is expended on scene after scene, and the results look polished and slick. But as a total movie experience, this is, at best, a guilty pleasure, and the scenes of character development are, well, mostly boring (although there is one terrific father-son advice scene with Dennis Quaid and Lucas Black early on in the movie). So, if you want to kick back and have a beer and pizza action Apocalypse movie, it's at least very competently done, but for most, this is one you can skip without fear of incurring the Almighty's wrath....",Legion
171,ladiesbane,Wasted talent.,3,16 May 2010,"Great names, good effort, and decent special effects didn't save this poorly written hodge-podge of other stories. Supernatural thrillers need solid world-building, and this was flimsy. Too much time was spent establishing too little character motivation. Poor choice of voice-over led to unintentionally comic moments. There was no build-up of suspense, no shocking visuals, and no payoff of any kind. Editing errors created non sequitur shots without reference points. (Unfortunately, the unreferenced shots were the only intriguing moments in the film.) This movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a drama, a horror movie, or a religious allegory, but the script was too weak to support any choice very well. There was great potential with this solid cast in a closed environment, but it turned into Maximum Overdrive with a zombie religious element.",Legion

A warmed over Terminator meets Dawn of the Dead, and not in a good way. Take all the boring parts of those two movies and you have Legion.About 30 minutes in, the story just stops and you have a group of people sitting in a dark diner complaining about their lives. Then a little more action, and Boom! Story stops and nothing happens for 45 minutes. The climax has some good action and a few wows but nothing to justify the previous two hours of boredom.As I left I thought how the more interesting story is what would happen after the film ends. So I was left a wanting for a sequel but knowing one wouldn't come because THIS movie was so bad.

173,Ayreesfoxx,Legion: When Zombies Have Souls,3,23 January 2010,"When in the first five minutes you see a cross, blasted upon a building, you know what kind of movie you're in for. Legion brings you to that point and never fails to disappoint from letting you glimpse into the minds of moviegoers, knowing what's really important. Writer and Director Scott Stewart bring an overly zealous plot, with nothing to gain from it but a sagging idea of what just happened, and plausible religion. The story falls on the days before the end of managain. God has lost his patience with humanity, so has sent his legion of angels to wipe the slate clean again. However, two things can stop this devastation: ""Fallen Angel"" Michael, commander of the armies of God, and an unborn baby, who once born will be the new Messiah. Michael rushes to the defense of the helpless mother and other in an out of the way diner, to hold off the onslaught of angels until the child is born.Collectively, all of the pieces are there to use if they can be placed in the right order. You have your cast of upright and respected actors like Denis Quaid, Charles S. Dutton, and Paul Bettany. In spite of that, you remove Bettany's humor and emotion, keeping him in one stoic face every frame. Better yet, Allow Dutton's character to have the majority of his lines in one monologue. Of course, bring in Lucas Black, and his deep southern accent just in like the plot does with this movie.Speaking of plot, that was another that was right in their fingers, then let slip through like so much dry sand. The concept of the armies wiping out civilization instead of protecting and defending is something somewhat new and inviting. Forget the fact that in Christian and most major religions, that's horribly wrong and goes against major pedestals in their faith. In fact – just forgo all ideas of religion. It will make it that much easier for the migraine to set in. unfortunately, much is manhandled into the final project, that you don't what you just given.For one, and really the largest issue logistically, is the simple fact that every one of the angels sent to attack, looked like the possessed from Constantine. While they begin to spring up, one could glance over to the handsome Michael (Bettany) that was the fallen one, and see which had the prettier looks. It makes you wonder, were only the high- ranking angels attractive, or just the cast down ones? Not only that, they acted more like conscious zombies, all working for a hive-goal, while ignoring guns that refused to run out of ammo (or was only shot twice before being thrown aside). Though it's not like you will really see or understand any of what's truly on. Between the awkward pacing and cheesy plot expatiation, bad split cuts coupled with blurry tracking and darkened scenes, you'll have at time connecting A to B. Which is always a shame when you can pick apart the mess the filmmakers couldn't, especially when it just becomes another bad action flick.",Legion
174,Old_Man_From_Scene_24,A good movie in general,1,6 March 2010,"Many people are giving this movie very negative reviews, yet I don't see why they should.No one is expecting an Oscar-winning performance here by any actor or the movie in general, but it makes a nice treat when you're bored or want to see something relatively fun.The key feature in this movie is Michael. Undoubtedly. He takes the idea of the word ""angel"" and turns it into a pretty bad-ass fighting machine. Gabriel does not disappoint either.I would recommend this for anyone really, but only if you don't care much about a coherent storyline and just want to see a film with some very good action scenes and some rather funny lines.",Legion
175,GenericBadGuy,Who knew angels came from hell,2,1 January 2013,"What angers me most about this movie is that it had potential. The idea is that God has lost his faith in humanity once again and he has sent a legion of angels (hence the title) to wipe out the human race and the only thing that can stop them is this one woman's baby. I never thought it would be a masterpiece by any means but I did hope for a fun popcorn flick along the line of The Expenables. However, now that I have seen the final product, there has been no such luck.First of all the only good thing in the movie, the effects. The look of the angels are really inventive as other than Paul Bettany, who plays the Michael who is the good angel whom God banished and is helping to save humanity, and Kevin Durand who plays Gabrial who has wings of steel (I'll get to that). Other than that all the angels are depicted to be these demonic creatures almost as if God has recruited hell's minions to aid him. Also Paul Bettany plays his role well, it's nothing special but at least it's better than every other performance in this train wreck.The rest of this movie is just, just god awful. The acting (with the exception of Paul Bettany), the overly serious tone and the countless dumb moments that either make no sense or are just unintentionally funny. You know when you have found a bad movie when you have good actors in it and they are terrible, Legion is one of these cases. When you have Dennis Quaid in a movie, and he is terrible in it, you know something, somewhere down the line went wrong. My guess why the majority of the movie is so laughable is the script. There are so many bad lines in 30 minutes of this film than most B-Movies have in there entire run time. Also the fact that it takes itself way to seriously. It wouldn't bother me if any of the movie had a remotely serious moment but it doesn't. Not to mention what seems to be an endless stream of dumb moments including a moment where an old lady demon bites a man's neck and starts to climb on the walls. Also, the fact that Gabrial has wings of steel just made me think of Batfink and that's not good. When you have something in you movie that reminds people of one of the cheesiest TV show ever, that said I'd rather watch Batfink than this piece of s***. It's moment like this that make me check out of movies and wonder why I put up with films like this.In conclusion, Legion is definitely the worst movie of 2010 and one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It makes no sense why movies like this keep getting made, they have very few if any redeeming features. This movie belongs in the pits of hell where no one would ever find it.

179,tj19,A Late-January Misfire... What A Surprise...,5,24 January 2010,"Legion (2010) Directed by: Scott Stewart Starring: Paul Bettany, Lucas Black, Adrianne Palicki, Charles S. Dutton, Tyrese Gibson, Kevin Durand, and Dennis QuaidWhen God loses faith in Mankind, Archangel Michael (Bettany) loses his faith in God. An out- of-the-way diner becomes an unlikely battleground for the survival of humankind as Michael and a group of strangers defend themselves against God's legion of angels. Michael must protect a mother (Palicki) and her baby, for it is the key to ending the Apocalypse. Let me start off by saying that Legion is not a good movie, however, it is not terrible by any means. Unlike recent biblical horrors (The Unborn comes to mind), Legion tries very hard not to follow the lame clichés of recent horrors; I always commend a film for trying to be good. Unfortunately, it takes itself a little to seriously with God's legion of zombies that are supposed to be possessed by angels. The film also was terribly written, (""What's your beef?"" ""Simmer down!"" ""Hold on white boy"") with weird scenes that needed some serious editing. Besides the bad script and erratic editing, the acting was terrible. The only exceptions were Paul Bettany (who seemed to have flown into the wrong movie) and Lucas Black (Sling Blade, Friday Night Lights). Everyone else was uninspired and made the bad screenplay look much more terrible than it was. The action scenes are where this film soared. The fight between the two Archangels was incredible, and the visual effects were on par. Overall, Legion is a biblical Assault on Precinct 13. It lacks a good script, editing, cinematography, and acting. I commend it for trying to be less like recent horror films that really shouldn't even call themselves 'films"". I think deep down, on the cutting room floor, there was something there, but we don't see it. Legion is by no means horrible, but I can't recommend it.Rating: 5/10",Legion
180,black_stormraven,Decent film that could have been better,7,24 January 2010,"With a very interesting and thought-provoking concept, Legion doesn't disappoint for those with moderate to no expectations going in. What's good about the film is, number one, the overall story; God loses faith in humanity and sends his angels to exterminate them from the Earth. Not exactly the standard telling of the Apocalypse. A second smart move by the filmmakers is the use of camera work; a lot of shaking and spinning and low lighting help to make the audience just as confused and disoriented as the characters, all of whom are relatable and believable. The actors really make you feel for them on the screen, make you believe that all of the events going on are real. The CGI was a bit uneven throughout the movie, sometimes being good, a lot of times being very obvious and rather sloppy. However, some of the camera shots of the foreground (ex. a string of light bulbs against a grey sky) were simply gorgeous; photographers dream of getting shots like those. Also, the careful use of high and low angles helped to build tension during the movie rather than go for a ""jump scare"", something sadly not seen too often in modern movies.About the only real issue I had with the film was why humanity's fate always seems to hinge on an unborn child for one reason or another; no reason is really given in Legion, though. Just once I'd like to see a movie like this not focus on a fetus where everyone has to protect the expectant mother and she has to stand by the wayside. Other than that glaring plot device, everything else just seemed to fit in place. The wings on the angels were an equal balance of function and beauty, the religious overtones weren't preachy given the subject matter, and the cameo from Doug Jones was a nice touch for fans of the versatile actor. The archangel Gabriel is once again handed the ""jerk"" card (Constantine, The Prophecy), but he's really the only other archangel whose well-enough known by the general public to fill the role of Michael's foil. Open endings mostly tend to bother me, but for a film like this with so many possibilities it was the wiser move to make; not necessarily to set up a sequel, but to allow the viewer to finish the story in whatever way he or she wants.All in all, Legion is a good movie. Not great, not terrible, but good. It explores the various weaknesses and strengths of humanity through individuals that are believable and make us sympathetic to their plight. The storyline is inventive and smart, pitting God's angels against His own children and the latter's struggle to survive; however, the script could have been handled better.

I have to say that the trailers were very good and prompted me to seek this one out on DVD but unfortunately it doesn't quite live up to the hype. Most of the action takes place in a quiet roadside diner in the middle of the desert, where our motley crew of customers find themselves being attacked by strangers seemingly possessed by demons. It transpires that these demons are actually angels sent by God to destroy mankind as a punishment for our sins. Yep, the apocalypse is upon us once again. Where's Buffy when we need her, eh? Luckily for us, the Archangel Michael has decided to rebel against God and save mankind. Initially, this seems like a more unique take on the old horror clichés and it does at least attempt to offer something a little different from the norm. However, the plot is so convoluted and full of holes that in the end none of it really makes any sense. If the pregnant woman is carrying the next saviour of mankind, then does that make him the Son of God? And if so, why would God want to try and destroy his own son and thus the whole of mankind anyway?

It had some great actors in there but so many of them just looked like they were wandering aimlessly in a bad script that offered each of them their own personal monologue that was painful to listen to. See ""I was a shorty"". The set was decent enough. It was isolated and offered everything a horror/action/thriller should.The angels themselves were disappointing. They waited around for the humans to get ready. They didn't even try to kill the more possess them half of the time.It's riddled with plot holes. Why is this baby important? Why are the people possessed? Why not have a more catastrophic means of destroying the world. Seriously wouldn't a mass fire or possibly another flood do it justice? Or is that not 'cool' enough?It's full of unintentionally laughs. The scene with a little boy and a knife is certainly a good example.In conclusion it only offers some good actors, who deliver performances ranging from mediocre to slightly good; some awesomely unintentionally funny scenes; and a decent premise that was not at all executed right.This could have been frightening and intense but sadly it wasn't.",Legion
201,josh-langston,Could have been something special.(Contains Major Spoiler),2,24 January 2010,"For the past month and a half I had been very excited to see this film. The trailer made it look like it had an interesting plot that sounded very promising and made the film look like it would be suspenseful and action-packed as well. As I walked out of the film, I left shaking my head realizing that everything I had anticipated being in the film, had actually been absent.To start off this review, I will say that I found the acting to be very poor. The different character roles seemed over-acted and they actors were apart of very cheesy dialogue. There were some funny parts in the film but I can not say that it was necessarily a good thing. I had anticipated some scary moments in this film along with some good suspense, but I found that I laughed more than anything.The plot seemed very good...at first. But by the end of the movie you're left in your seat with many unanswered questions for starters: ""Why was the baby so important?"" Yes, it will supposedly save mankind, but how? Is the baby the second coming of Christ? I don't know. Also, the film provides a creative twist at the end, as we find out that everything that happened (the flood of angels and everything else that had gone on) was really God testing Gabriel and seeing whether he was merciful or not. But this twist then made me realize that if that was the real reason for all of these things happening, what relevance does it have with the ""savior baby""? Why even have that piece of the film in? It just didn't make sense to me and left me leaving the theatre with a lot of questions and no answers. It is one of the more disappointing films that I have seen in my life to say the least.",Legion
202,jeffreydelmore,Just enough history,8,6 March 2010,"Okay, I know the Bible, Old and New Testament, not from a religious standpoint but from that of a historian reading the Bible.

When a movie comes out that may have 'history' as it's premise or reference, I have to go and see it. Not quite sure why, but it's inevitable. Hence, ""Legion"", Now this movie isn't a history lesson, thank goodness after all. But when it touches on it's back story or history, it doesn't warp it in a sense that it rapes the facts to serve the film's storyline. It's quite on par and the explanations, when given, are brief, accurate enough and don't make the hair on the back of my neck stand on end. So, I check off the history and now I can enjoy the movieand I did. I'm not all business, mind you. I enjoy comedies and action movies and all sorts of genres, but it seems I gravitate to historic venues. I must say, I really enjoyed 'Legion'.

The whole film is a story about stealing a pregnant woman's child; as he is humanities last chance of survival.I thought this film was pretty good. Again, a lot of cool action sequences and the acting was very good between every character. I must give credit to the character of Michael who really is a shining beacon of light in this film, very well acted and a fantastic character.There are scenes in this that were incredibly funny. The old lady in the diner for example; that scene was epic. It was just something that you didn't expect from an innocent old woman, which was something i really liked; the surprises in the movie.More or less, the only downside in my opinion was the boring set designs. It was just a desert, sand and literally only 1 building throughout the entire movie. There were often a lot of long shots of a desert, which were very often repeated. It was boring to see the same design over and over again.Overall this film is good. Especially the characters, plot and the action sequences. I was just a bit disappointing with the set design as it was just 1 design throughout the whole movie (first 10 minutes excluded). But nevertheless, this is a great horror film and i really recommend it :) .",Legion

Most of us are fasciniated by seeing something which always exists in our dream world on the big screen. With such theme its easy to come with an interesting concept but very hard to actually pull it off through the entire length of movie and to top it all, come up with an interesting ending. I though Constantine did it well. That's why its rating is 6.7 as apposed to 5.0 for Legion.The movie starts off with excellent suspense that something big is about to happen. The scene involving the old lady at the diner really made me jump out of my couch but after that the movie went downhill. After the initial wave of attack of the demons/angels, Michael gives the warning that a much bigger thing is about to follow and all we see in the end was 1000 people standing still outside the diner.

Jeep - OMG - LUCAS BLACK IS NEARLY TWICE HIS AGE IN REAL LIFE!! In the film, he talks nothing like a 15 year old, sounds nothing like a 15 year old, acts nothing like a 15 year old. It is actually impossible for the audience to relate, or sympathise with his hopeless crush on a much older woman (who he ends up getting?!?!) I was really waiting for the battle between Gabriel and Michael. I was surprised it came with them on unequal terms, and i liked the flip and few other aspects, but it demanded soo much more!! The only character one comes close enough to feel is Tyrese Gibson's. The film did a good job making the Angels look like bad guys, like demons. We never found out why the child was ""hope""?

Not a single ""person"" in this epic was likable (or believable) and the entire film was paced up and down every 10 minutes like a TV pilot. Long-winded diatribes by boring characters droning endlessly over misspent youth or pubescent angst was interspersed with occasional blood letting by ""possessed"" beings who attack by the millions but give up and waddle away after a few of their numbers are mowed down by endlessly loaded automatic weapons wielded by the few humans left in the area. Unfortunately (or fortunately if you have anything against bad scripts and worse acting), these ""living"" characters start falling for well-tested zombie ploys and charging stupidly one-by-one to their demise as the cast narrows obediently to the select (very) few for the final, incredibly stupid conclusion.And through it all runs the thread of God's ""will,"" as articulated by writer or writers who can't possibly have gleaned their craft from anything more complex than Harlequin novels. The God of Legion is easily bamboozled by patronizing angels into destroying mankind with a plague of B-movie zombie-types (who even bite on the old vehicle-by-the-gas-pump trick that George Romero pulled off in 1968), yet bright enough to see the error of his ways, maybe.Eeesh, this hound was painful to sit through.

The trailer looks compelling too, so I decided to watch it, despite another reviewer here in IMDb told me not to, whom I should have listened to.The story is, an angel called Mike refused to carry out Apocalypse and decided to defend survivors in a highway service area.The beginning scene where Michael cuts his wings is quite a surprise, but then the actions are boring and completely expected. The dialogs before granny turned to a zombie were completely dull and not related to the theme at all. The scene where the bugs shaded the sky was fascinating and I thought the movie is starting to be fun, but I was wrong. The movie turned out to be an average zombie movie after Michael the angel arrived. Now that we know the mighty god's Apocalypse is carried out by angels enchanting everybody to be a zombie to kill a baby in one of the survivors womb. The world-wide Apocalypse is just about a few survivors shooting baby-hunting zombies(or angels) in a service area in the middle of nowhere! The thing I don't understand is, if angels can enchant all the LA citizens into baby-hunting zombies, why don't angels enchant those people inside the restaurant too? Isn't that a apocalypse war should be like angels fighting with telekinesis power? The last 30 minutes actions are pretty good though, the scene Gabriel spinning his metal wings and swinging his utility hammer is very cool. The angel dual fight scene is the only reason I'm giving the 3 scores. The ending is nothing but just funny. Mike came back from dead and killed Gabriel with a bang because god wanted love.

221,theworstseats,Needs divine intervention,3,22 February 2010,"Since Al Gore told everyone that the world was going to end very soon there has been a noted lack of guidance about what to do when the inevitable actually happens. Hollywood, as always, has stepped into the breach, presenting a series of likely disaster scenarios and how to survive them. The most recent of these is Legion, a step by step guide on evading a vengeful god.In Legion, God (Christian, white) has decided that enough is enough and humanity should be punished for all its warring, raping, pillaging and general good times by being extinguishing it. Archangel Michael, heaven's equivalent of General MacArthur, couldn't disagree more and decides to stop his old boss by travelling to earth, robbing an armoury and shooting anything that looks evil (apparently God also has demons). It's not just a straight out fight though, every fantasy story also needs a macguffin and Legion's is a mystical baby that Michael must protect for humanity to survive. It's a little bit like Terminator 2, but with a less believable antagonist, and based at a truckstop in the desert.Theoretically, an action film with a massive special effects budget and a plot that revolves around gods and guns shouldn't be too difficult to make. Unfortunately, when you combine the two and get the guy who normally does the effects to also write the screenplay it is doomed to failure. Scott Stewart, the writer and director of Legion has done exactly that, managing to make a film that feels like he's just strung a series of his favourite special effects together and then wrapped it in any old hackneyed plot.Despite the below par narrative, Legion has a reasonable cast. Paul Bettany is convincing as the tortured ex-angel Michael, while Lucas Black puts in a competent performance as Jeep Hanson, the mystical baby's slightly dim step-father. It's sad to see Dennis Quaid being given so little in such a mediocre role, but as the saying goes, you can't polish a turd, and he, like the rest of the cast, does the best with what he's given.Legion is a difficult film to watch, building up tension before letting it slowly wind down in lengthy character development dialogues, which then usually culminates in a totally unrelated special effect. A more specific and focused plot it could have made it a reasonable film, but as it stands it seems more like a made-for-TV late night special than a Hollywood blockbuster.www.theworstseats.co.uk",Legion

But let's take it a bit slower: although some might find it too religious, others sacrilegious, the idea, the foundation this film is built upon is not that bad.

When chosen the second path, it still presented lots of opportunities, chances, which were lost one by one on the way. With all the weaknesses of the crew falls the story apart. Sometimes its an action flick, sometimes a zombie apocalypse, and so on, but it never manages to decide upon one. It has great actors, it has buds of character-development, as clichéd as it is, yet, without much reason and remorse throws those away in ways that just don't do justice to the characters motivation, only serve them to a more or less inventive death.

Sorry to be so harsh but I haven't been this disappointed with my movie experience since Borat...both movies warranted a visit to the theatre manager for a full refund (apparently he had seen the movie too because he made no hesitation in refunding my ticket). I will have to agree with Shawn Savage...the back story dialogues REEKED of cheese and lulled the watcher to a semi-catatonic state. The only redeeming quality of this movie was Dennis Quaid, and even HE looked like he didn't want to be in it.

Personally I would class it as a cross between the Prophecy films (without Christopher Walken hamming it up!), and something like 'The Crazies'.I actually found the character development just fine, and I enjoyed the slower pace which reflects movies such as Carriers and The Crazies rather than Quantum of Solace which seemed hyperactive and crude by comparison.I thought there was a good undercurrent of humor throughout and the actors were top notch. Everyone comments on the special effects and a certain fight scene but I felt that by far the best thing about this film was the feeling of indecision and uncertainty which lent it a far greater realness than endless testosterone fueled 'action stars'.

Most of these films have one decent actor trying to carry a bunch of weak unknowns. Legion has a far better cast than watchers will expect. Every one of the folks in the ""alamo"" is, at least, a very good TV actor and there are four quality movie actors in this crowd.The end suggests a sequel, but I'd rather see an extended version which didn't slice out all the plotting which might have made this one hold together better.

At the beginning is somewhat strange, and turns out to be some terror- exorcism movie at the twenty minutes of film. The plot is very common and to tell the truth, I don't want to see good people dying for nothing. This movie's characters are good and most of them die. So.... I personally dislike this movie for that. The second half of the movie is somewhat more positive, but there are many dear losses trough the film that can make you really sad. Of course, it has a happy ending, as I said, the second half of the movie is the best. Besides of that, the fact that they standed against hundreds of zombie- like people with only guns in a simple diner is incredible. I mean, they were everywhere and never even entered the diner.

240,KingLongshanks,Average flashy action movie,5,9 February 2010,"Like many others I wanted to like this movie. I love most end-of-the-world and survival movies, especially supernatural ones with zombies or vampires.While I never wanted to walk out of the theater, there was little keeping me in my seat.The acting was strong enough, considering what they had to work with. (Except for the actor who plays Dennis Quaid's son : Jeep). Where the movie went wrong is with it's action and its overall story. The few action scenes were lame. The battles made no logical sense, and just served as ""insert battle here"" to keep the movie going. Considering the purpose of the attacks in the context of the movie, each and every individual battle was useless (considering these attacks were planned by God...).We are never given explanations for any of the key points in the story, we are expected to sit back and watch angels and those possessed by angels fight it out for some reason or another, among several paper-thin characters.The two creatures shown in the trailer (the reason anyone is interestd in this movie at all) The wall-cralling granny and the stretched ice cream man... they serve no purpose whatseover. In the context of the movie, they still make no logical sense as to why they were sent in on their own. They are just pretty pictures, and are probably the only two memorable scenes in the movie.The movie is filled with unexplained plot holes (and Terminator similarities...), including a couple which render the entire movie nonsensical. This movie is just a light show, with nothing memorable, and nothing new to bring to the genre. Skip it and wait for the next one.The Book of Eli was much better, and Daybreakers was mildly better.Note: Dennis Quaid always gets a bad rep for making a slew of lame movies and playing the hammiest character in them. I actually found him very likable in this movie along with Charles Dutton. The acting was the one strong point in the movie. (well maybe not strong, but it wasn't bad).",Legion

Well, I love those type of movies and Legion does not compare to them, or appear that it attempted to be part of that genre in any way.From an action movie standpoint, it basically lacks action. It has a few scenes I would categorize as 'decent'. The previews completely mislead viewers in this regard.From a drama standpoint, the script is absolutely horrible. Even with good actors reading it, some of the dramatic parts drag on unbelievably. And there are just way too many of these parts for such a horrible script.The plot and characters are underdeveloped, the acting is horrible, and the movie just drags on and on. I am hard pressed to find anything good to say about it other than that there are a few decent action scenes.I know it's not the most 'wordy' review but it's really tough to say much else about this movie.

If you go into it expecting such a thing, you will be disappointed. But I tend to judge a movie by what the makers were trying to do, and I think Stewart is trying to tell a ""Lifeboat"" type story here -- yes, the whole angels vs. humans thing is going on, and that's not spoiling anything if you've seen the trailers, but the focus is on the characters trying to survive it.And those characters are well written and acted. Focus on them, and this film is a good character-driven action drama with an apocalyptic horror backdrop. Focus on the supernatural action movie you imagine this is, and you won't enjoy it. It's as simple as that.I liked the movie a lot once I figured out what kind of movie it was. The only problem I have with it is the way it ended. Without spoiling it, it left things open for a sequel -- way too open, without really concluding or explaining anything. The conflict is ended, and it seems unlikely that it will happen again, but more questions are raised than answered about why this happened, and the future of the world is uncertain. The good news is that since the film is really about the characters, and since the characters' individual plot lines seem to have been resolved, one way or another, I'm not left unsatisfied by the movie on that level.And I totally agree with other reviewers that scenes that are supposed to surprise the audience shouldn't be shown in the trailer -- I really wish they wouldn't do that. The trailer should give you some idea what a movie's about, and maybe show some cool scenes, but it should NOT spoil the movie's surprises, and _Legion_'s trailer spoiled it.",Legion

Nothing at all, maybe that would have been the one and single only character development they should have focused on.Then there's the pace of the movie.

THIS PLAN IS *BLEEPING* STUPID! YOU ARE SENDING ANGELS, BEINGS THAT ARE IN HEAVEN BECAUSE THEY ARN'T MURDEROUS, TO KILL SOMEONE! THAT'S LIKE HIREING THE PEACE CORE TO Commit GENISIDE! besides the last time god was angry with the world, he sent floods, he sent fire from the sky, he sent frogs from the rivers, boils, HE KILLED THERE FIRST *BEEPING* BORN! i don't know about you BUT I THINK THAT WORKED.my next problem, the very idea that these people will fight off the mounting force is *bleeping* ridicules, lets put on our brainy goggles and find out why. OK based on a resource i found in early or late 2009 (wiki answers) roughly 19,000,000,000 people (being humans) have died, OK for fare argument, lets say that... 70 percent of those people went to heaven, the rest went to hell, or purgatory. this leaves us with 13,300,000,000, OK, lets also say for fair argument that 5 percent of this number are like Micheal (the angel that rejected god) they didn't want to do this. this leaves us with 12,635,000,000. OK, THATS HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT YOU DEAD, THERE ARE 10 OF YOU, AND BY THE END OF THE MOVIE THERE ARE 3 IF YOU COUNT THE JOHN CONNOR/Jesus, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEAT THAT! and thats only to scratch the surface... but to debunk my ideas, if you don't think, you will enjoy it sinisterly, frankly ima person",Legion
250,Part_One,Certainly suitable for passing a couple hours of your time.,6,27 February 2011,"I find myself often at a loss to understand what people expect from films these days...reading some of the reviews of this film you would think it was one of the worst films ever made...this is really quite unfair. In response, in particular, to monster92's review...1. I had not seen a trailer so had no real expectations. You have to be rather naive to think that a trailer represents the entire content of a film. How many trailers for action/comedy films have you seen when the trailer actually contains the best bits? I for one remember my utter disappointment at seeing the first Michael Keaton 'Batman' movie. As a 19 year old life long fan of Batman (at the time, somewhat longer in the tooth now!) and a disciple of the Moore/Miller comic revolution I was thrilled at what. in the trailers, appeared to be a tour de force of action etc. My best friend and I queued for hours in Leicester Square to get in.....and left 2 or 3 hours later feeling completely dejected and disappointed at what we had witnessed. So...lets forget what trailers promise for now, they promise much but deliver little like any form of advertising.2. I personally felt the action was well paced throughout not a full out 'last 10 minutes of a Rambo movie' but steady and fairly well executed on the whole if at times a little predictable.3. Of course the acting was 'melodramatic' considering the situation the characters were in. Would you have preferred them to all be relaxed and smiling?? 4. The character backgrounds were telegraphed but in a film with few characters how else can this be done? It seems to me you were expecting a film that consisted entirely of angry angels flying around attacking humans for 100 minutes and no actual plot. Perhaps that is why you feel disappointed.Other reviewers have cited 'Prophecy' in their comments and to be honest I agree. 'Prophecy' was an amazing film for its time and Walken as Gabriel was quixotic and enthralling. If you have seen 'Prophecy' then consider this film as a CGI remake. It does not have the power of the original (perhaps because it lacks an actor of Walkens ability in a lead role) but is certainly, in my opinion, worth watching as a modern 'remake'. Not brilliant....will be forgotten quickly...but not as bad as some would have you believe (depending on what you expect from an 'action' film).Worth a watch :o)",Legion

The idea of good vs bad angels isn't a new theme, neither is the idea of a last stand at a restaurant/ coffee shop but who knew the angel Gabriel was really Thanagarian? Mad wicked mace. This film wasn't as clear as to what the Angels were made of as Gabriel bled during his fight with Michael. They conflict between the two angels didn't seem genuine. At the end as the characters are driving away I thought this reminds me of Sarah Connor at the end of the first Terminator only to reveal a backseat full of weapons much like the the coffin in Terminator III. I expected a better cohesive story considering powerhouses like Quiad and Dutton. It felt like some one had the idea to combine a few established actors with some not as experienced but recognizable actors and press out a hit. All of the best ingredients don't always equal a delectable dish. If your a fan of any of the actors you'll sit through to the end.

He tells that story to a kind of thug-character and then tears come from the nice man's eyes. Why? it was not touching. Not at all. If the tough guy was telling that story it might have been interesting. But not this way. The audience in my theater was laughing. Even the women. How bad is the writing if you let your character cry and the audience starts to laugh? And there are more lines like that in this movie. I remember the time when people were saying that adult movies were bad because they had no storyline. Then the industry started to produce those kind of movies with storielines and the movies got worse. Why was that? because a story is not good simply because you let your characters say ""anything"". This movie feels like one of these ""adult"" movies with a ""story"". You just wish you could skip most of the dialogs. The action scenes are OK though. Paul Bettany does a very good job by playing a somewhat bizarre Archangel, who looks strangely at you so you have the feeling he really isn't from this world. Not as good as Christopher Walken in ""God's army"" but still very good. His wings look stupid though. But that's just a footnote. I did like the outline of the story, but the bad dialogs ruined it.

Frankly I'm not interested in its theological accuracy because I don't think this was its point. A tip to begin with: If you want to watch films with religious objectives or for theological accuracy then do not bother with this...If, however, you want to watch a fairly entertaining film with some good action (albiet not wall-to-wall, some good acting and a few really creepy moments then give this a go.There are some criticisms that I do accept. The characters could be fleshed out more fully and the script is equally patchy at times, but, the film has a mystery about it. The reasons for God's wrath are not entirely clear though they are hinted at, the identity of the infant saviour is not apparent, nor what can be done to redeem humanity. Personally I like a bit of mystery.If you don't want to be educated by films (I generally don't) or intellectually challenged (I do at times) or to have your religious views reinforced/endorsed (I don't have any) then I think you should give this a chance.",Legion
261,springtownspears,Apocalypse In The Desert,5,31 May 2010,"Despite some thrilling though somewhat isolated special effects, some notable one-liners, (""Perhaps he (God) got tired of all the bullshit"", repeated for emphasis both at the movie's beginning and end,as if it were the movie's keystone, ""It's not going to matter anymore"") and considerable star power (Dennis Quaid and Paul Bettany), this movie lacks the panache to be called great or even good. Perhaps it's the choppy pacing or editing, or the uninteresting cinematography. At any rate it never really grabbed me, though I would recommend it, provisionally, and there are several moments when it works well. I don't often find myself in agreement with critics, but in this case, I might. It's not as good as ""Zombieland"" or ""The Crazies"" though it is blacker than both and some might disagree. Dennis Quaid often finds himself involved in trashy B-movies (""The Horsemen"",""Pandorum"") and this may be another case. His role, in fact, is interesting. He plays the owner of a diner in the remote desert whose bimbo pregnant daughter, who works as a waitress at the diner , lives out back in a trailer. She later turns out to be the movie's New Madonna. A traveling couple and their teenage daughter, who stop by the diner, are in the wrong place at the wrong time. A swarm of insects is the first sign of impending doom. Paul Bettany as an avenging angel could also be cast in Clive Barker's Book of Blood. He makes one grand entrance out of a ring of fire, and another out of a car. As the movie progresses it turns into a zombie-fest, as some movies are wont to do. The most interesting character, in the latter portions, is an avenging child zombie. The avenging and protecting angels then engage in an Epic Battle which is, somehow, less than Epic. The movie ends on a positive (?) note but by that point I did not really care.",Legion

266,tomaz-povsin,Not bad for a religion-based movie,6,11 June 2010,"Having seen quite a lot of religious-based movies (from ""The exorcist"" over ""The prophecy"" to ""Stigmata"", not to mention many others like ""Constantine"") I have to say that I was quite pleased with ""Legion"".First of all I have to ask all the religious people which are whining about ""Legion"" not mentioning Jesus - what do you think the unborn child is? Even Michael said it: it is the saviour of mankind, the last hope for humanity, ergo - the newest (second) reincarnation of Jesus Christ (Christós means ""saviour"" in old Greek). For everyone, who wanted to see a 33-year-old male in a toga, this may have come as a disappointment, but as those people so much like to tell non-believers: not everything in the Bible can be taken literally, not even the ""second coming"". I am glad that the authors didn't stick in a grown-up Jesus descending from the heavens in full battle gear; that would have been really cheesy.The acting was probably not the best; definitely not as good as in ""The prophecy"" or ""Stigmata"", but I wouldn't outright mark it as bad, it just didn't stand out. Granted - some of the dialogues and scenes were outright cheesy, stupid and predictable, but I expected stuff like that from a religion-based movie, made in Hollywood.As for the shooting and fighting scenes - i thought they brought some much needed action to the otherwise short-dialogue-filled movie, plus most of them were executed pretty well, especially the angelic bar fight (i loved the hi-tech low-tech weapon).What i liked the most in the movie were the deeper morality undertones, especially the ending conversation between Michael and Gabriel. The point was well made: If God tells you to do something horrible (like slaying your only son - remember Abraham?), you shouldn't take it automatically for granted as the best option; sometimes disobeying atrocious orders is the only possible way unless you want to become a soulless monster - and it also defines the free will God supposedly gave us, to do good deeds regardless of what says in the Bible or anywhere else.Bottom line: ""Legion"" is not a great movie, but neither a bad one.

Nothing was believable, far too often you found yourself watching these characters talk to each other, explaining their own background while you sit there realizing that you don't care at all.

273,marekmcmanus,So much wasted potential,4,1 March 2010,"This movie had so much going for it, and just isn't the sum of its parts. You have Dennis Quaid and Paul Bettany on the actors side, decent special effects and a pretty cool premise going for it, so why is this movie bad?Here might follow some spoilers, but I will never go into detail. First of all, all the dialogs in this movie are awful. They seem to be trimmed to be cool one liners with a punchline, that might seem cool in a movie quotes section but suck if the whole movie plays out like this. Specially if the whole movie is crowded with those cardboard thin characters.The story puts all the emphasis on its own weaknesses. This movie basically plays like a survival horror movie, a bunch of people is stuck in a diner and fights of an army of zombies, err angels. So everyone knows what's gonna happen. The ""actors"" are basically there to be cannon fodder. In this movie, you got a real interesting spin on the whole Christian mythology. Heaven, angels, archangels, all that stuff. Instead of putting the emphasis on this mythology, like why did god lose faith in humanity, what's going on in heaven and all that potentially interesting stuff is put aside, to tell the background stories of the cannon fodder. Those stories are so stereotype and cliché-driven, it's just painful to watch and completely takes out the pace of the movie. No one cares about these people, they're just boring. In the end I wished god's army would have been a little faster.Dennis Quaid and Paul Bettany probably needed the money, there is no other explanation for their involvement in this movie. The other actors seemed appropriate B-list actors.To make things worse, during the action scenes the editing really sucks. There are only few action scenes, but those completely lack any choreography. So instead of choreographing the fights, they resolved to jumpy editing. Flashing one shot after the other, which usually ends in a confusing mess. Even worse, there are real holes in the fighting sequences, at some point I thought they might have pulled a shot or two, to get a PG-13 rating, but hey this movie is rated R. I'm not sure if the editing really sucked, or if they were just holding back a ""Director's Cut"" for the DVD release.This movie might be worth a rental, if you watch it with a bunch of friends and beer in steady supply, but definitely not for cinemas.",Legion
274,justinbrowning,Its OK,6,19 March 2010,"I went to see Legion the other night.I have a Cineworld card that means I can watch as many films as I want for free (well £13.50 a month) and so films like Legion where I might have waited for the DVD I will go and see in celluloid glory.When I first saw the trailer I thought to myself this is a film I need to see. I liked the premise and I liked the idea of Paul Bettany being a tattooed up Angel. But as the film got closer to release I lost, for some reason, my enthusiasm. The story is that God has basically given up on humans and launches a clear up spearheaded by his Angels and Michael the angel decides he loves mankind too much to let it happen. Mankind's only hope lays in the belly of a pregnant single mum. High concept.The film started very well. Michael the Angel (Bettany) comes back to Earth cuts his wings off and goes off to find a safe house full of massive machine guns. He has a stand off with some demonically possessed Cops and as he drives off, the electricity in LA (I think) turns off block after block. It is a very good atmospheric start. Especially as he blows a hole in the safe house wall in the shape of a cross. My mind wondered to going to see Blade for the first time. One of the best openings of all time back in the day and it blew me away (and it could be argued changed cinema). With this at the forefront of my mind I edged forward in excitement.We then get to meet the other main characters of the film. A small garage/restaurant/service station in the middle of no where populated by a few hicks. We have a gruff Denis Quaid (whose character seems to have given up and I couldn't work out whether Quaid is playing this or cant be bothered himself) and his son, Lucas Black, a chef played by Charles S Dutton (the preacher from Alien 3), a pregnant girl (Adrianne Palicki) who smokes and some visitors (family of 3) who have broke down.Things then get a little screwy. The TV and radio goes on the blink (cliché), a strange cloud is noticed in the distance (cliché) and then an old lady turns up. The old lady sits down, orders a steak and promptly tells the pregnant mum her child will burn in hell. She then reveals herself to be possessed, bites the neck out of someone, crawls around the ceiling and then gets pumped full of lead. The film is still moving at a good place and I feel like I might have found a little Gem. This is a very well handled start.Michael the Angel then turns up and the film goes downhill very quickly. It hit me that for all the premise and promise of the trailer the film hasn't got the budget or clout to match this. Soon lots of possessed people (possessed by Angels) start to appear around the station and Michael pens everybody in to protect them. What then happens are loads of scenes where the ""heroes"" talk about how they were basically nothing in their lives blah blah blah. Boring. Real boring. I can see that that the Director/Writer are trying to create a sense of caring about the characters and what will happen to them but the lines delivered have a sense of ""I've heard this all before"" to them. It didn't grab me and it didn't interest me. I wanted to see Angles ripping each other to shreds as promised.I won't spoil any ending for you but I just felt that this film ran out of money and ideas pretty quickly. Kudos though to Paul Bettany who is very good and should get a shot at more action films instead of just being a bit part Brit pretty boy. At the end we do see a fight between Michael and the Angel Gabriel which is brilliant but just made me wish we would have had more of that in the middle. Also I am sure there is a massive plot hole. At one point Bettany says that the possessed won't come near the unborn child....but how did the old lady get in then?

276,Metalman1995,After much thought...,3,30 April 2011,"Oh Legion, what a waste of potential.When I saw the TV spots and trailers for Legion, I thought it was going to be a cool religious type thriller, demons and angels fighting it out in an apocalypse. I like that kind of thing for some reason. Now I have quite of a bit of complaints about this movie, and they all lie in the story, characters, the writing, directing, and the cast. This movie is, quite a messy one. There are plot holes that shake your head, but even with the poorly written story, these characters, oh god. These characters are so generic its almost painful. There's no way you can feel for these characters. They're extremely stupid, annoying, and ill minded.They have no idea how to handle themselves. The main antagonist (Kevin Durand as Gabriel) and protagonist (Paul Bettany as Michael) I found some interest and liking to. At least they knew what they were doing. Speaking of which, the only scenes in this movie that I liked had to do with Michael's back story, Gabriel, and their fight scene (which is the last one). That only takes a mere 20 minutes of this movie. The rest is the characters dealing with this apocalypse in the horribly written and criminally boring dialogue scenes about religious and/or life mumbo-jumbo that you do not care about. Or some angels that the director tries too hard to make seem cool, but then they're down in 5 minutes in such simple ways of battling, like 1 bullet.Yeah the cool ice cream man in the trailer, yeah he only gets 1 and a half minutes of screen time.Now i didn't hate the directing in this movie, but it was a downfall. The action in this movie was well done in my opinion, but the directing is at fault in the dialogue scenes. It is only half of what makes the dialogue scenes pointless and boring. There's little style or ""Umpph"" and i like to call it.Now, the last thing, the cast. What. The. Heck. The only bright spots in the cast were Paul Bettany, Kevin Durand, and maybe Tyrese Gibson. Everybody else made their characters so unlikable. Adrianne Palicki and Lucas Black had 0 chemistry. Everybody else was absolutely nothing special, best defining the characters they played.Recap: -Good: Bettany as Michael, Durand as Gabriel, and the Final Fight scene (even though its too short) -Bad: Everything else",Legion

278,malvaradovilchez,awful movie,3,26 February 2014,"At a remote diner in the middle of a Western U.S. desert, a group of unsuspecting people will become humanity's last stand against the most powerful force in the universe: God. It is a time of darkness, where the fate of the world would be influenced by a cook, a father and his son, a pregnant waitress, a stranded family, a lost motorist, and the archangel Michael. God has had enough of mankind's wayward ways, and as he did with the great flood millennia before, he's decided to once again wipe out the human race. Michael has chosen not to follow God's orders -- which include killing the pregnant waitress Charlie and her unborn baby that's destined to grow into mankind's last hope -- and has joined the band of what is to become human resistance fighters against God's army of angels who inhabit the bodies of human beings. It's spiritual warfare taken to a whole new level Legion's take on God and His wanton destruction of human life will prove downright insulting to Christians and laughably far-fetched even for nonbelievers or those of other faiths. The picture tries to justify this second ""God-wrought apocalypse"" by citing the flood (of Noah's Ark fame), but it ultimately paints God as the de facto ""bad guy"" of the movie and ignores most everything else in the Bible; sure, God goes unseen, but His powers, angels, and minions -- the latter of whom are, apparently, humans possessed by angles who become demonic zombies turned against their will and working for God to kill an unborn baby and its mother -- are front-and-center, while Michael, the ""hero"" of the film, is supposedly an Angel that now has more peace and love in his heart than does God. Whatever, it's a terrible premise that seems to go out of its way to upset anyone of faith that sees it, but the real kicker comes in a scene that seems to go completely against the entire presupposition of the story. With the gang holed up in the diner, a van carrying a father and child arrives; the father frantically tries to quickly pump gas into the vehicle, but it's a trick. When the father is killed, a character heroically tries to rescue the small boy who, it turns out, is one of these angel-demon-zombie things. In essence, ""God"" -- who has lost all faith in man because of his evil ways -- plays on a man's honest and well-intentioned humanity so ""He"" may kill this individual and, by extension, more easily kill the mother and her baby. It makes no sense; the human character obviously had enough good within him to save a random child, but God uses the character's goodwill and humanity against him, even when, supposedly, there's none of that left in the world.This may very well be a first for a major motion picture: Legion is at times halfway intense, invigorating, and fun, but it's also completely devoid of significance and proves downright goofy at the same time, and that's not to even mention the ridiculous ""God as the bad guy"" angle. The movie can't even get that right, as if God would need angels masquerading as demon-zombies to do His work for him (no fire and brimstone to get the job done in three seconds?), making an already passably lame movie just plain stupid. Legion earns a couple of halfhearted points for some decent direction and atmospherics and a few spurts of entertaining action, but it gets little else right.

I watched most of the movie, just fast forwarding past a few of the slow parts in the middle. There are definitely major problems with this movie. If you care about theology, the idea that God is the bad guy in this movie won't sit well with you. Even if you don't believe in God, the idea that His army can be held at bay by a few untrained people with some automatic weapons is pretty silly.On the good side, there are some pretty good fight scenes, just probably not enough to keep most people happy.

Basically the writer of the movie wanted to go in the direction of the Second coming of the Messiah by keeping it from being born. Acting is horrible with the exception of Bettany. ""the last time that god lost faith in mankind he send the flood"". Basically this time he sent angels in a way. The angels are not physically there they just possess human beings and send them against other human beings. The movie loses its way when the old lady who is supposedly possessed by an angel says things like ""your f-in baby is going to burn"" and ""shut up bit** all you do is complain complain complain"" Being a Roman Catholic Christian, this is not something in my opinion an angel would say. It's more human like than something a heavenly being would say. Also the possessed beings are more like zombies as they bite peoples necks and runs on ceilings. I gave it a five because it has serious potential and i kind of know which way he was trying to go but his lack of talent for story telling is what ultimately turned this movie into a snorer. The scene with the two angels Gabriel and Michael fighting was awesome more of these type scenes would have made the movie much better. For example instead of angels possessing human beings he could have used other angels to attack them and let Michael and his angels fight for man kind and then the final show down would be between the two Archangels Gabriel and Michael. those familiar with the bible know that under Michael and Gabriel there were legions of angels. Michael had his own Legion and so did Gabriel. If it was more like Angels defending man kind with Michael against angels trying to destroy Mankind with Gabriel then the movie probably would have been a lot better and much more entertaining. all in all this movie has the potential to be a great movie however with the lack of storytelling, acting, and dialog this movie suffers. i would not recommend you see this movie in the theater.

The special effects, what little there were are OK, but this is like watching a firecracker blow up when you are wanting a stick of dynamite. Please, don't waste your time.",Legion
287,dean-harmse,"Story might not be original, but performances are excellent!",8,10 June 2010,"This movie didn't arrive in my country with much fanfare, so before I bought a ticket I did some research. Most reviews were negative, but I went to see it out of pure boredom. I didn't expect much and having read all the negative reviews I watched it with my critics glasses on.I actually enjoyed this movie. Never have I given a movie 8/10 before. Why did I do it now? Performances. I reckon the people who went out to see this movie expected blood, guts and fecal matter flying all over the place. Instead they found hardcore actors doing what they do best. Even lesser known actors were up there doing it with the masters of the industry. Paul Bettany is one of the most underrated actors of our time. When has he ever given anything but a solid performance? Dennis Quaid? His prettiness might be a thing of the past, but as a performer he grows with every movie he makes. The same goes for the whole cast. They all acted like superstars.You won't like this movie if you're into mindless B-grade BS. If, however, you like movies because the actors telling the story makes a fantasy feel so real you actually feel you're gonna break the armrests off your chair you should do yourself a favor and see this movie.On a final note. Being a Christian myself I did not find this movie offensive at all.",Legion

The action is great, the characters are believable and the acting was spot on to the situation. An example of a believable character would certainly be the Archangel Micheal, the Protector Of Man, who still has faith in the human race even though God has lost His. Though I hate to agree with the critics there is one aspect of the movie I have to agree with them on and that is the story line. What significance does the child have to save humanity and if he is some sort of Messiah or prophet why would God want to destroy him? Oh well, maybe they'll make a sequel that explains it all in the end, and maybe will be able to see more of Mister Micheal being all bad ass.",Legion
289,ppartridgeofCR,"okay movie, though controversial",6,26 January 2010,"Well, my original thoughts on this movie were that it would be the mostly mindless horror and violence and more of telling a story and teaching a lesson...I don't know if that was more of my hopes being up after seeing Daybreakers last week or what, but I had thought that this movie would have a way to watch with a Christian perspective and might have a message about faith within it. But, as the movie started and worked it's way through, i started to feel let down.Basically, the premise is that God has lost faith in humanity and decided to start all over again. This is after our second savior was conceived, and since He had changed His mind, He decided to send his angels to possess humans and use a select few to destroy the entire race and, specifically, the new savior. After being given the order to dispatch to earth, one of God's generals, the archangel Michael, comes down to earth, refusing to follow along with the plan and, instead, choosing to fight against the angels to protect the unborn savior. He goes to a diner where Charlie (the mother of the new savior) works and soon the attack of the angels begins.There's a large fight with intense scenes and shooting and stuff, mildly frightening, but really nothing to make you jump out of your seat or anything. This passes and you get to learn a little more about the characters who are being held in the diner before the archangel Gabriel appears to kill the baby, and that leads to the finale of the movie.Anyways, the start of the movie seems to have more of an OT view of God, one of a vengeful God who will punish those who deserve it and He has lost faith in humanity because we have lost faith in Him. Michael defies Him because Michael is the only one who seems to still have faith in us. The idea that God may lose faith in humanity and start over may seem sacrilegious to most of us, but if we look at the story of Noah, we see it has happened before, and that story is even hinted at in the movie.*****Next part contains spoilers, scroll past next paragraph if you want to miss spoilers*****But, after Gabriel kills Michael, Michael returns to protect the baby, after having returned to Heaven, and explains that, although Gabriel may have given God what He asked for, he had given Him what He needed, and for that, God forgave him and allowed him to return. This still may seem a bit sacrilegious to some, but at the same time, we see that God really is a caring and loving God, something which Christianity teaches us. It's just something I had expected to see earlier (thinking Legion would actually be a number of demons or fallen angels, since it is the name of a demon in two of the gospels)...but the way it ended didn't make the movie seem as much of a revelationist view as what I had expected.Overall, I guess I'd rate this movie a 6 out of 10...pretty good, but definitely not great...could have been fixed in a few ways and they seemed to have kept it too much on the idea of a vengeful God and not a forgiving one for what I had been hoping for.",Legion

293,guyanesesmoothcriminal,It's not perfect.....but it's not bad either,7,17 March 2010,"Legion is good movie for what it is. Of course there are some ups and down but every movie has those moments. Most of the users have been very negative towards this film while I find it to be a very refreshing film. Notably, there are only two other films that tackle this genre. One being Demon Knight and the other being The Prophecy. Both of them were good on their own merits and I stand by what I say when I say so does Legion. 5.1 over marks underrating this film. At least a 6.5 would have been nice. Now, moving on to the aspects of the film that I feel makes it stand out.1. It's not like most of the main stream horror movies these days where most of the elements comprises of cheap scares, skin and awful remakes.2. The story is not top notch but it is interesting. What makes it a bit weak is that the writers tried a pilot project that had the potential but were unable to flesh it out. Still the story passes the mediocre line.3. The action scenes are executed with dexterity. Not too shaky nor too fast. The main thing is that the viewer gets a thriller without eye strain.4. The acting was not bad. Some actors were enthusiastic and some apathetic but it really does not hold down this film. Not to mention, I've seen worse.All in all, I have no idea what people expected. It's not the LOTR or Dark Knight. It's just conventional horror trying it's best.",Legion

Paul Bettany was very enjoyable as the fallen angel who goes against god. For me this was a film with a lot of missed opportunities... the ice cream man who turned into the human spider.. here was a moment that was drawn out and you were expecting a big attack and it ends so abruptly with NOTHING happening. When all the cars start driving towards the diner why they stop and get out is beyond me... why they don't just run all 300 cars into the diner killing everyone is something i wont understand... there is no real explanation for a lot like why Gabriel didn't just show up right away, or why the director cast Lucas black(God truly punished me by showing black try to act). Overall it was a fun movie but flawed. I did enjoy it but felt that i kept asking why is this happening A lot. And as the main characters drive away to end the film we see ""our Sarah Connor"" (even wearing a bandanna) and she says god is tired of the bulls**t and i have to agree i was tired of asking why and trying to figure out the bulls**t. in the end it needed to be simpler with more action... to much was left to the imagination. have faith... have faith they will corrected the wrongs with the straight to DVD sequel.",Legion

That theme resonates with us, because it says that Everyman / Everywoman has the hero within them, and the right circumstance can bring it out.The pacing is perfect -- it's easier to enjoy something hot after you've been cold, and vice versa.Paul Bettany makes this film -- I can't say enough about him. He is as awesome here as he is in Priest, which isn't surprising given the strong similarities beteeen the two characters. What a terrific actor.Kevin Durant plays his brother Gabriel -- a short role but in those few moments his acting was also superb. I don't know if his facial expressions were enhanced with CG but the nuances were notably outstanding.The story is quite original and one of its highlights is the resolution of the tension between the brother angels as they related to their father (God) -- once you accept His anthropomorphization as artistic licence, it's really quite beautiful -- as is the uplifting statement it makes about the nature of humankind.",Legion

301,noraquick,Die Hard meets Dan Brown & Brutalizes The Seventh Sign,1,31 January 2010,"The shortest summary I can give is this: If you think Die Hard is the greatest movie ever, think Dan Brown writes the truth, and believe in the Christian God but have never read the bible, this movie is for you!Or perhaps this will suffice: Take The Seventh Sign, discard the history, trivia, and mystery, put in automatic weapons and lots of explosions, and substitute an English angel for a German Jesus, and you have this.Wasting his acting talent, Paul Bettany plays Michael, the archangel basically known as a warrior. So he cuts off his wings, robs a gun shop, and gets ready to kick butt. Why? God, apparently p.o.'d at humans for being humans (that from the guy who made them in his own image...I'll let that one pass for now) has set forth the apocalypse. No four horseman, just humans possessed by angels because apparently the CGI of thousands of wings would have cost too much.In the middle of nowhere at a diner is a unwed pregnant mother who doesn't want her baby, her snarky atheist boss at the diner, his slightly retarded son who is in love with the mother-to-be. Add in the black cook (Charles S. Dutton channeling Uncle Willy from ""Demon Knight""), the yuppie couple with a slutty teen daughter, and last to arrive is Tyrese playing an on-again/off-again gangster or perhaps traveling salesman. They never elaborate because he is black and carrying a handgun, so he must be hardcore, right?First comes an old lady who eats yuppie man, then comes Michael in a stolen cop car. Dozens of people die, lots of flies swarm, bullets get wasted, and conveniently all utilities go out...except the gas (so you KNOW there will be pretty explosions).Long story short, Michael, all hard-boiled, explains the child was not meant to be born, so being born unwrites history (Er, isn't the Christian God omniscient? So.....why the hell would this happen anyway?) and the fight is on to get the baby born and keep it alive.We have some cannibalism, some creepy children-of-the-corn action, but mostly shooting and explosions. It's interesting to note that the first 2 to die are the black guys leaving only white people, and the 1 atheist played by Dennis Quaid of course dies.Because anyone who has ever whacked off to the apocalypse hates blacks and atheists, it seems.This movie taught me abortion is always wrong, being retarded and having blind faith that that hot girl will want to F you makes you the most pure human being alive, that violence solves everything, and the Christian God is a petty egomaniac with too much time on his hands.

GOD was portrayed as a human, with a heart and a mind that contradict each other, also he was depressed, people might say this was a bad decision but i think it is correct, since humans are the image of god (according to believers he made us like him) 6. YOU SAW WHAT YOU WERE EXPECTED TO SEE, there are no plot holes!! because the director wanted you to see just this, and nothing more, if other people could understand this they might also understand the whole plot. 7. here is a hypothesis so you understand the baby's role. the baby was the second coming, and since god was angry at humans he didn't want to give them a second chance to survive, now since Jesus became god it would mean the baby becomes god in the end (of his life), thus bringing with him his happiness and love for humans... so humanity survives....i could go on, but it'll take all night so in short:Legion is a movie that you have to see without expecting it to be the movie of the year, and over analyze every damn second of it. go watch it ONLY for entertainment and to kill an hour or so I'm not a fan of any of the actors or the director but i watched this movie with a free mind and i enjoyed it",Legion

This movie could have been a lot better, had they spent more time with the script, and focused more on why the infant was so important, and even more on the relationship between Michael and Gabriel.

This can all be found by watching the trailers. What they don't show is a plot that has some unforeseeable advances and other rather predictable ones. The mindset for this film must contain an active engagement with the story and ones ability to see it as the director envisioned. This contains some of the best CGI fighting sequences I have seen. For anyone commenting on the plot they should regard the film in its entirety. The biggest flaw is not taking advantage of the PG-13 market which would probably sacrificed the films integrity. The plot is not distracting like it was in transformers two. Though the action scenes alone are well worth the price of admission.In the end take this movie head on with an open mind and be prepared for some angel on angel action! lolz,Legion

I couldn't figure out if certain parts of the movie were supposed to be funny or if the acting was just so cheesy that they were.

They share the screen in this awful addition to the apocalypse genre in which angels fight for control of a pregnant waitress.Quaid plays a low moron, a role he's spent his entire life preparing for, who somehow owns a roadside diner. Black plays ""Jeep,"" his hayseed son whose southern accent instantly justifies the extermination-of-humanity theme of the movie. The rest of the film features Tyrese Gibson as (please not again) the Angry Young Black Man with paternity issues and a recently-fired handgun.

Hyped up as the movie to end all doomsday movies, it turned into a movie I'd hope to forget. After being released just last Friday, it was only evident by the lack of a crowd, that this movie wasn't going to give ""Avatar"" a run for its money. The central idea behind ""Legion"" starts with the pregnancy of an unwed woman and the meeting of a group of total strangers at a desert gas station. The protagonist, a poorly educated wimp of a mechanic, acts far less than a hero throughout the entire movie. Not until the end does he show some semblance of heroism, when he says, ""F* you."" Yes, that really is all he does. This movie was full of predictable moves and lines. Dennis Quaid should quit acting altogether. ""GI Joe"" was seriously enough to put a dent in his career. The most aggravating part of this movie was the inability for its creators, Peter Schink and Scott Stewart, or director Scott Stewart to be original. The lines spoken from Michael to Gabriel are verbatim taken from 2007's ""Gabriel."" The car chase scene with Gabriel attacking from above looks exactly like it did in ""Underworld."" As a matter of fact, ""Underworld"" did it twice, in number one and ""Evolution."" The scene with Charlie and Jeep standing on top of the cliff looks like ""Lion King."" I mean, seriously? You couldn't do any better? The zombie humans looked like something out of ""Resident Evil"" and the jaw dropping was a straight cop from ""I Am Legend."" The evil kid would take first prize in a ""Chuckie"" look-alike contest, for sure. They had actor Tyrese say, very unnaturally, ""Back when I was a shorty...""

It was even funny, the grandmother scene is hilarious, as is the stretchy guy. If the film had carried on in this way, it could have salvaged itself. But no. The angel concept was badly considered, there was no explanation of the rational, and frankly if the best anyone's god can send to eradicate mankind is a swarm of flies, followed by a relatively small army of fairly useless zombies, then its no wonder mankind got itself so screwed up! The concept of the saviour child, is not explained, so everything seems relatively pointless. The premise for this film could have been an absolutely epic, apocalyptic feature with feuding angels, fire and brimstone, humanity brought to the edge of destruction, mammoth scenes of human zombie carnage.

346,tom_saxon,"Solid, subtle story line",8,20 June 2010,"Despite the trailers and how ""Legion"" was marketed, this is a very intelligent, well-crafted, and subtle story. To be quite blunt, this is a ""message"" movie that unfolds in a way that is a bit more discrete than what most viewers will be expecting.On the surface, the plot is standard judeo-Christian fantasy on a contemporary backdrop; God orders his army of Angels to wipe out the corrupt human race, particularly one yet unborn human who has the potential to lead humanity back to the light. One Angel disobeys and chooses instead to protect the unborn human and his mother. Angels with automatic rifles, a ton of violence and many of the clichés we have grown accustomed to seeing in straight forward action-fantasy movies.Beneath the surface the key themes of the narrative are righteous disobedience, single-minded hope against all odds, the sanctity of family, and the horror of human existence, all against the backdrop of postmodern human civilization.The central orienting principle of ""Legion"" is doing what you know is right, even if it seems irrational, and even against the apparent will of a much higher authority than ones self; that in doing so you are facilitating the re-emergence of a logically and morally structured world from the rotting corpse of an illogical, seemingly meaningless and amoral world. A very apt and moving message for the times in which we live.In all ""Legion"" is one of the few stories that manifest as humanity trying to make sense and right of an apparently insane and corrupt world. This film tackles the malaise of postmodernism in a way that is bold and brave on very many levels. For this reason, many people will simply not ""get"" Legion, especially the religiously, socially, and financially well-established. But this is not a film for anyone who's mind turns away from real dissent, though those who already find themselves on the precipice, and are able to see past the clichés, will find that this story resonates with them and is, in all, a rather enjoyable ride.",Legion
347,devilhog,Legion - a bit bland,6,22 June 2010,"After having seen the previews for Legion several times, I really thought it had a ton of potential. Going strictly off the previews, my initial thought was that the one who went to protect the group of humans was actually the Devil defying God's will to eliminate the human race.Unfortunately, my preconceived notions and ideas for the film were way off. It turns out that the whole movie is predicated on the notion that the Biblical God decided it was time for the human race to be vanquished. So, let's say that I buy into the fact that God wants to eliminate the human race by having his angels possess ""the weak minded"" (as they were called in the film). Typically I would eschew any idea that God would go against His own will, that being the Book of Revelation in the Bible, but in this case, we will let it slide.I actually had no trouble believing that Michael would defy God's will because Lucifer (the devil) did it, so theoretically, any angel could. My biggest problem with the film is three-fold. It had nothing to do with the boring exchanges or how slow paced this apocalyptic movie was. It had to do with the theology behind it:1.) So, let's say I buy into the fact that God is sick of the human race, and he does his whole angelic possession thing. The fact that Michael changes God's mind on the whole apocalypse thing just astounds me. I mean, think about how difficult eradicating the human species would have been for God. He loves them so much that He killed His only son for them. So, the fact that an angel died in his human body, went up to heaven to plead the human's case, and God decided, ""Well, I guess you are right, I DO LOVE THEM."" It's like God was drunk when he made his order to kill everyone and didn't realize what he didn't until Michael came back and explained it to Him.2.) God didn't seem to exist outside of time in the film. The Biblical God exists outside of time. That means that He can see every moment of every second in any time period. This is extremely difficult to imagine for us. But let's say that we can understand it. If God KNEW that He was going to ""fail"" in His objective against the human race, why would He have done it to start.3.) It wasn't clear what the movie was actually about. Was it about saving the human race? Was it about Michael and Gabriel being tested? Was it about faith? What on earth was this movie about? It is so convoluted it bothers me. I would LOVE to think this movie was about God testing Michael's faith and love for the human race. But when Michael returns in angelic form he lets Gabriel know that he changed God's mind, this makes absolutely no sense to me.I really had high hopes for this movie, but it just fell flat for me. The acting was actually pretty good. I just don't understand what they were trying to get across in this movie.",Legion

Anyway, Legion was amazing. The effects were phenomenal. I loved the plot and the movie freaked me out. Legion partially reminded me of Dawn of the Dead, and I'm a zombie movie lover. I love movies where people are being attacked. That sounds so mean XD But I answered a question on Yahoo! Answers. The person was wondering if they should watch Legion. I said they should, despite everyone else saying ""Hell No"", and the person loved it. I guess everyone's opinion differs, but that's mine :D",Legion
349,longjaso,Inaccuracies outshine other problems,4,30 June 2010,"This movie was not up to what I was expecting after seeing the commercials and reading the back of the box (which does not describe the movie accurately at all). So here's the rundown on the basic plot - a pregnant woman is going to give birth to mankind's last hope, but God has lost faith in mankind so he wants to kill all of us ... so he tries to have his angels kill the baby but Micheal (the archangel) does believe it is a good order so he defies God and protects the girl along with everyone else in the small diner that is under attack. That is the whole plot. The issues I take up with it though are the fact that nothing seems to line up correctly. Micheal explains that the possessions are actually by angels (but they seem far too sadistic and bloodthirsty to be heavenly creatures) and Micheal talks to Gabriel saying that he was always eager to please God ... Gabriel is a fallen angel though ... biblically. On top of that, the description on the back of the box talks about how a group must fight off an evil demonic legion and even the title itself ""Legion"" is not a reflection of anything. Legion is the general of Satan's army. I may be nitpicking - but when there are such glaring inaccuracies - other things like the gas station pump making a smaller explosion than the stove in the diner seem too minimal to pick at.",Legion

Not only will Mike the archangel lead you to believe that bullets and semi-automatics are the way forward in saving the world, in this movie, they really are.The cast of characters consists of an unbelievable collection dimwits, half-wits and the village idiot, they're all in the movie. None of the characters play a key role, and Mike the archangel is, until the point that I stopped watching, a dud.In a nutshell, the story is simple: God get's angry, decides to destroy the world, but is betrayed by Mike who leads a bandwagon of semi-docile trailer-trash and angry ghetto folk to fight the zombies err angels. In an obscure desert gas-station (cheap budget location) they are gathered to do what they do best, yes blowing up anything that moves. Yup, I was rooting for God.",Legion

To my disappointment, all but ONE of the angels turns out to stay in angel form, while ALL the other angels possess all the townsfolk and turn them into some hills-have-eyes-like mutants and they go down in like 2 shots to the chest... 2 shots to the chest? Are you serious? Even zombies need at least a head shot to go down. And for the angel that stayed in angel-form (Gabriel), he could fly, and had bullet-proof wings, that's basically all his powers.. He carried a fancy mace (that didn't seem to have any power, just a fancy bludgeon) and needed to wear a bullet-proof chest-piece because apparently 2 shots to the chest seems to take down just about any angel. I thought the angel that came to save them would have some powers but all he did was bust out some sub-machine guns and just shot everything. He called himself an former general of God's army, but I'm sure that any US marine would do much better than him. He held 2 sub-machine guns at the waist and went full auto, not worry the least bit about wasting ammo..I had a lot of high hopes for this movie but was really disappointed.I the best part of the movie was the short footage of the swarm of angels and the ""angel fight"" (which was disappointing still, but basically the best part of the movie).

The plot makes no sense (and they don't bother trying to explain God's motivations for selecting the means God chooses to deal with humanity).The last 30 minutes (as has been noted by other reviewers) was the biggest problem.

I have to admit that i hadn't seen any trailer before i started watching Legion. The movie captured my attention when i took a look at the DVD cover. The impressive wings on the angels back reminded me somehow of X-men's Archangel. So i just started watching this with no expectations at all.The opening 20 minutes were not that much interesting to watch, but than again i can never stop watching a movie in the middle of it. So if you consider stopping this movie in the first 20 minutes i can assure you you'll miss all of the best bits! So hang in tight and get past the first 20 minutes or so.The actions scenes are good i guess, at least i enjoyed them! The best thing about it is that they modernize biblical aspects very well. A modern view on angels and demons if you like! The setting of the movie is rather strange at this diner in the middle of nowhere but than again maybe thats what makes it so special.In conclusion this movie gave me more than i expected, as a matter of fact if you could compare it with any other movie i would like to compare it to Constantine that in my opinion really disappointed me, while Legion gave me what i expected from Constantine. Bare in mind that both plot lines are different of course! I enjoyed watching it, really got in to it at times. Not the best movie i've ever seen but definitely not a waste of time either in my opinion!",Legion

The special effects were awful, looked so fake. I couldn't even follow a lot of it, I was so bored. Well, at least I didn't waste money on renting it; caught it on HBO or something.

Maybe I'm alone in this, because other reviewers are singing his praises, but he was terrible in this film--the overly fake accent, the earnest good boy BUT I LOVE HER EVEN IF SHE IS A CHAIN-SMOKING WHORE spiels, multiple fatherly speeches from other male characters, and NO good action scenes. He was totally unnecessary in the film. The writers should have ditched Jeep and had Audrey take the place of that character, because apparently his most important roles were driving the damn car and almost getting killed by Gabriel.Speaking of Gabriel, there's quite a bit of Kevin Durand hate going on, which surprised me because I actually liked his performance. No shitty accent, no monologues, just some good old fashioned Wrath o' God going down.

It basically showed the close to good parts of the movies. And if I'd rate the trailer and movie of which one is better, I'd pick the trailer. The cast is fine, not all A list, mostly B or C. But who cares. We'd wanted to see a good B List Movie. And this didn't even make the expectations. It was set on one setting. Angels, Legions, and Demons. The script was horrible. It was boring, and it was over-dramatic. I'm 12 years old, and I know this review doesn't sound professional, but hey, bear with me, when a 12 year old kid sees a boring movie, they know it's a boring movie ESPECIALLY if it's an action movie with monsters and angels, who doesn't want to see it. I don't know much about the cast, but it's fine.It's a rip off. The first hour was good, and then after that it was boring. There was shooting and guns and just the regular stuff. Paul Bettany was iight. The plot basically shows of a woman who is pregnant, and her baby is believed to be the new 'Jesus' and somehow, all the angels in heaven wants to kill that baby. So they're stranded in the middle of a desert in a restaurant and car stop. Now, it's kind of cheesy because they have these monsters, deformed people, invading the place.

362,GnorthernGnome,Give this film a break,7,24 May 2011,"It often pains me, after seeing a film I consider perfectly watchable, to come to IMDb and find the majority of reviews ripping it apart. Though this is by no means a masterpiece it is an enjoyable, well structured film with good acting, good scripting and a solid plot. I've seen lots of people complaining that the last quarter is a weak point and though I can see the argument it still does run everything back together nicely. There are some weird points not fully explained (SPOILER: the prophetic tattoos on Jeeps arm?) and I do find the level of character death-rate slightly too high. Yet I finished the film feeling it had made its point: humanity is basically scum but with redeeming features, nothing too high brow or original but valid none the less. I didn't find the acting or lines overly cheesy or strained as others have said; in fact I thought Paul Bettany did a damn fine job being the soldier built on compassion his character required. Perhaps he could have been slightly less mystical about his intentions but then again I wouldn't have thought many people would accept ""I'm an angel disobeying God by protecting this potential prophet"". Overall, what I really wish to stress with this review is that the current 5/10 rating is fine until held in comparison. IMDb currently rates films which ARE poorly scripted, cheesily acted and generally confusing with plot lines such as X-Men Origins: Wolverine and The Lost Boys at much higher status (6-7/10) and I don't feel that, in comparison, Legion deserves its current status. It is very similar to many big Hollywood films such as Wolverine: it's an enjoyable, well acted romp with some decent if not too subtle character development and a script which does the job.",Legion

So the plot for this movie is just a cheap-rip off of the Terminator, just with, angels.From a movie that is supposedly based off of a book that has no explanation and no proof of it's origins yet around the world people actually believe it, they do a downright horrible job of following it.Very little of Legion actually has a form of action, the script was at a TV level, none of the acting was believable, the acting was very melodramatic.Plot: 3/10, Acting: 5/10, Character Development: 4/10, Rating: 4/10 (Crap)",Legion

I find the idea of the protector, the (as yet unseen) prophets, rune tattoos, and the child not-meant-to-be suitable to the task. The ending has received some complaints, but, such is always the case with trilogies: some people just don't realize how trilogies get made; you leave the viewer wanting more.

They should film it on more locations, tell more about Michael(wings in first plan), add more of everything...

In Bible you can easily see what kind of Appocalypse it will be. Third, Angels are not super-heroes, nor they posses people. It only do Demons (As Legion from Bible). Good sides are also there. When Percy talk to Kyle about Kyle's gun, you can hear some really nice words from Percy, about what his father was talking to him when he was young boy. Also, Michael's: ""You've done what He wanted, I've what He needed"" is great quote, too, and it should be directions in our relations with close friends and family. Other characters are good-shown.

Legion is not that movie.What a tremendous disappointment this movie was. As others have noted, the concept was fairly original and definitely held much promise. Unfortunately, the people in charge of bringing the concept to life were entirely incapable of doing so. There were so many problems with this movie it's hard to know where to begin.To be fair, the acting wasn't bad. Nobody is taking home an Oscar, but the characters were somewhat believable, if not fully developed. I definitely had a hard time connecting with some of the characters, but that had more to do with the God-awful dialogue they were forced to recite. Whoever wrote this movie should do the world a favor and remove all pens, pencils, markers and anything else that could be used to put letters on a page from their reach forever.While the characters weren't saying things that were either completely unnecessary or just plain stupid, they were doing things that were completely unnecessary or just plain stupid. I understand that movies like this require the viewer to suspend disbelief in order to appreciate the story, however, it would seem that the writers and directors expect the viewer to suspend their abilities to think and reason as well.Ultimately, this was a blown opportunity of epic proportions. The directors took a great story idea, decent acting, a substantial effects budget and turned it into an uninspired and totally forgettable waste of two hours.",Legion
370,J8_sin,Disappointing,6,13 January 2014,"The movie was great, I mean, excellent, but only for the first parts. I honestly love the plot and the stuff, but the first time watching it after my friend told me about the ""rifle mounted angel guy""? I EXPECTED Michael's introduction to be more dramatic, like falling down from the sky and crashing across the street, or maybe at least when the shotgun daddy pointed the gun at him, Michael would spread his wings and rip his shirt off to show the epic abs that we only see on the cover, I bet Paul Bettany's not happy. After an hour, the movie seems ""rushed"", like, the first battle of Gabriel and Michael was good, but the final one? Meh. Everybody hates one hit kills.THIS is how I expect the movie (briefly):After the first wave, there should be the ""tests"" for everyone, not just the wife. After the tests--the second wave, that's exactly how it should be, but when Michael was gonna save Audrey? If he hasn't already spread his wings to show Bob, he should do so and crash out the front door, then cutting down and shooting the angel zombies, then after he saved Audrey, an explosion should blow his wings off. The other parts are actually OK, but alternatively, they should split up and drive one car into the city--the members in that car should be the guys, assuming Michael also saved Kyle. They should be retrieving something, possibly an emergency baby delivery pack or stuff like that, and waves of zombies should appear (Michael should be shirtless by now). Michael epically shoots down tons of zombies with some crazy acrobatics and marksmanship skills. They return to the saloon to find out that the angel zombies have surrounded the place. Percy should still be alive (the acid should only take one arm). Michael climbs up to the roof and tries to kill the angel zombies, but there were too many, so Percy told the guys to get out of the car, then he attached some bombs (Michael should have some) to the car and drove it to take out some of the angel zombies and lure the rest. He detonates the bombs and MOST of the angel zombies die. The guys made it in time to help Charlie deliver the baby. After that part, everything should go on like the original story, until the chase. Instead of killing Audrey, Kyle should shoot Gabriel from the car, but of course, he was dead in the original story, anyway, Kyle should shoot Gabriel from the car, but some mysterious force stopped Gabriel from catching up. The car got a flat tire, and as they stop to change a tire, Gabriel catches up and tries to kill the baby. Michael flies in at a really high speed, shirtless, blocks Gabriel's attack, causing the ground to shake and dirt fly all over the place. Michael parries Gabriel's attacks until Gabriel manages to disarm Michael. Michael takes Gabriel's mace and smashed Gabriel's armor, showing that Gabriel also has an epic body. They fought with fists and wings for a few minutes. The battle should include slow-motion shots, flying, sending each other flying with a strong blow, and land-destruction. They should be really fast, and finally, their fists should clash and some kind of a sonic explosion should happen, causing the other 5 survivors to fall on their knees (except the baby). Michael punches Gabriel in the stomach, causing Gabriel to fall to his knees. Michael picks up his sword and the story goes on like it would in the original. The five survivors survived. And congratulations, that'd be an extra hour.",Legion

The location is in the beautiful New Mexican desert. And the plot has just the right amount of action and character development. It is the rare type of film that as I watch it again I see new things in it each time. However I suppose you have to like Zombie films. But as for the hate this film gets. It is totally irrational. I can only guess that people who don't like this film are either put off by the religious themes or just hate zombie films.

Yes, the angel depicted on the cover does mean that it will be religious oriented, but considering the many different versions of angels, it should NOT surprise people that this depicts a different version. It is very frustrating to read reviews that bash the movie simply because it goes against their view of angels. That is the point of Science fiction/fantasy movies in the first place! I was able to follow the movie's plot and depicted mythology, but people who make a living reviewing movies automatically stamped a ""dumb"" on it because it doesn't show angels in a good light. Uh, what do you think is supposed to happen when this ""rapture"" that people talk about happens? The movie shows all the devout Christian people turn into angels who begin to kill those they see as heathens.. Kinda tells me the souls of those who became angels were taken to heaven, doesn't it? I love the movie, and only just recently found out about Dominion, which I plan to watch at first opportunity.The movie has death, birth, talk of religion, abortion, adoption, custody battles, marriage troubles, teenage rebellion, love, substance use, even the military is mentioned with one of the background characters said to be a former Marine who had his hand destroyed by a grenade. The reviews that say there is too much dialog just don't understand the amount of character development that went into each person who was in that diner. A married couple with a rebellious teen daughter, a black 'thug' in a custody battle over his kid, a former marine amputee cook, a pregnant single waitress who plans to give the kid up for adoption, a mechanic in unrequited love with said waitress, and the diner/gas station/truck-stop Owner who thought he was going to make it rich by building in a ""future-prime"" location. Each character is meant to associate with the audience, even if Kyle is more 'stereotype token black guy' than anything. All that dialog is necessary to tell this epic level story. Though I thought it would have been better as a mini-series, I still love this movie.",Legion
378,thoremann,And I thought this was gonna be better than Gabriel,2,4 April 2010,"What I don't understand about this movie was how slow it started and how quickly they ended it. The audience were left blank to what the ending should be about. I was like ""What the hell was that?"". I liked the movie Gabriel and the emotional depth and great action scenes were well balanced. I thought I was gonna see something better than Gabriel, judging by the fact that it was also about angels and salvation. I was dead wrong. The movie could have been a thousand times better if they only worked on the last 20-30 minutes of the movie. The acting was fairly acceptable, that is if I were watching The Days of our Lives and listen to them whine about their sorry lives. But THIS is a MOVIE and it should have a plot. Sadly the plot was eaten away by, well, the plot itself. The movie's attempt to create a unique and out of the box scenario only destroyed the sole purpose on why the people watched the movie in the first place. I don't want to be harsh and say that this is the worst movie of 2010, but because I wasted my money to watch something that was entirely not to what I expected, I think I deserve to be harsh and say that THIS is the worst movie of 2010.",Legion
379,scottnunn,An Excellent Film which can be confusing,9,7 March 2010,"The story of Legion is a great one in my book, it's filled with Action and has an awesome storyline but can be a bit confusing if you don't know the whole deal. The story starts out with Michael coming to earth to side with the humans about God wanting to destroy mankind once again and sends Gabriel to do this.Let's start off with the Characters and I got to say I was surprised to see Dennis Quaid in this as well as Tyrese but overall everyone of the characters fit there roles perfectly. There was quiet scenes which had great dialogue and then high packed Action Scenes. I should point out that this movie is not a gore flick, I won't say to much but there are a few parts of blood but not a whole lot.The Story is where people can easily get confused and easily call this movie ""bad"". They explain it clearly; however if your not a bible reader you will have no idea who Michael and Gabriel are. I am a strong believer in God and Jesus so this movie was very easy for me to get into; my sister isn't a believer in God so she was lost a few times and had to explain things to her.I will be blunt: This movie is Great for people who read the bible and understand the Angels; if you don't do either you can easily get lost in this flick. My Score is a 9 out of 10; mostly because of that particular reason.",Legion
380,kinstamusic,This Movie is Eerie to Me,10,6 July 2017,"Guess what? This movie is similar to a few dreams I had. That is what makes it so scary. Anyway, I am tripping out as to how cool they make these angels out to be. Gabriel and Michael fight like they are cool to the floor, but like they are stone cold killers. What excitement. What delight.",Legion
381,PigeonPanic,Tolerable if you're looking for mindless entertainment,3,29 January 2010,"Well. I am writing this review just after watching the film at the theater. I assume that it was *meant* as a serious action film. It does not come across as a serious action film. Instead, I get the impression that someone might have watched Dogma and thought, ""Hey, this isn't bad, now let's do it without the comedy. Oh, and while we're at it, let's do for angels what Twilight did for vampires. In fact, let's *combine* the two, so that we have humans possessed by angels biting open the throats of innocent bystanders"". What an excellent idea. Not.If you were to ignore both the glaring deficiencies in logic and the poorly-veiled anti-abortion propaganda, you might be able to consider it an okay film. (Maybe better than okay, if the idea of angels with automatic weapons appeals to you.) Just a brief look at the screenwriters' ""logic"" will be sufficient.Point One: A woman gives birth in what appears to be quite a short amount of time, without benefit of anesthetic, and very shortly after, is able to quickly climb up the side of a plateau while carrying her infant-- right after she and said infant survive a car being flipped multiple times, while she's holding the baby in her lap.Point Two: Angels can possess humans, but can also be killed by guns. And it's never explained why the mob of angels doesn't have any useful powers like telekinesis or anything to defeat the humans, and why they instead stand around like it's Night of the Living Dead while the protagonists escape. Or maybe it was explained, and I just missed it because I was too busy laughing at the seventy-year-old woman climbing on the ceiling like Spiderman.In general, the actors themselves aren't bad, but most of the characters seem-- intentionally or not-- written to be unlikable, the exceptions being those who, of course, get killed off first.",Legion
382,ngrey651,A 90-Odd Minute Waste Of A Birthday,4,5 February 2010,"Lemme explain why I'm giving the film this review...I've seen a lot of films. A lot of films. A LOT of films. And most have always had some big moral that could be applied to everyday life, some ""lesson"" that people could take away from watching said film. A few of these have been religious or philosophy-themed movies.For example. I have seen ""Passion of the Christ"". Mel Gibson's an Anti-Semite and that PISSES me off, there, I said it. Got it out of the way. Back to the movie. I was...well...it kinda made me cry. I mean, you REALLY feel for Jesus in that film. It wasn't all torture either, you could see plenty of instances within the film where he's portrayed like an average, everyday nice guy who just carves wood for a living...which makes his death even more tragic. I've seen ""Left Behind"", the first movie. It drew me in, I admit, in casting believable characters in an unbelievable situation...and DAMN, Gordon Currie made a CREEPY Antichrist. I've even witnessed the ""Book of Eli"", which has placed an important emphasis on keeping faith and understanding the importance of religion. Also, it hammered in a bit of a big point: even in a world with literally NO Christianity, there are always gonna be assholes who cause suffering.Then I saw ""Legion"" today, adding to my ""collected Religious movie experience"". What can I say, I would be able to view it for free. I thought ""Why not? Surely it can't hurt, the trailers seem interesting""...Boy, was I dumb. Boy, was that movie dumb. And I mean really, REALLY full of itself dumb.Hey ""Legion""! THIS is what I think of you! YOU'RE STUPID!!! Yes, it had some very decent characterization in it, very nice action scenes and the idea of being stuck in an enclosed place while trying to make sure the main character gives birth successfully turns the film into a ""Breakfast Club from Hell"" kind of deal that was sort of, in a cosmic sense, funny.But the plot? PHBBT. B-movie. Not even, really. Apparently God has utterly lost all faith in Humanity and sends angels to (I couldn't make this up if I tried) possess the bodies of ""the weak-hearted"", which ranges from grannies to LAPD to little kids. And why? To exterminate humanity like we're cockroaches and they're divine pest control.Though the ultimate goal...and once again, I remind you I couldn't make this up if I tried...is to kill an unborn child that belongs to the main character, Charlie. Why? He's going to be the Messiah and God's sick of second chances.First of all, isn't this breaking his covenant with humanity? You'd think, if nothing else, an almighty God would be the one to keep his promises. ""I won't ever try to wipe you out like I did with the flood ever again"". Furthermore, possessing little kids and grannies to kill a BABY? God's acting an awful lot like Satan in this film. Oh, and let's not forget one poor, unfortunate schmuck is (rememberI'mnotmakingthisup) NAILED UPSIDE DOWN TO A CROSS, COVERED WITH PUSSY BOILS WHICH EVENTUALLY EXPLODE. Yes, explode. They are acid-filled boils too.The word for today is ""Macabre"". Can you say that, kids? It means ""Really, reeeeaaaaally sick"", or ""shockingly repellent"". This is what the premise of the movie is. Yeah, it's okay to WIPE OUT AN ENTIRE SPECIES BY USING THE MOST UNDERHANDED METHODS POSSIBLE. You can do that because you're God.You gotta be...GAAAAH!!!Jewish people believe that even GOD ALMIGHTY is to be held accountable to the force of JUSTICE...and clearly, these are the actions of neither a just god...nor a loving god. The movie casts God as being quick to change his mind, willing to do heinous acts and refusing to give what is supposed to be his only son a comeback...and only Michael the archangel has any faith in humanity, and it's BECAUSE of Michael that God ultimately changes his mind. (Though he shouldn't have even been put in that position where he had to have his mind freakin' changed!) There is only one really good thing about this movie. The end comes with a flashback voice-over. ""I asked my mother why God would stop loving his children. ""I don't know"" she told me, wrapping her arms around me. ""I guess he just got tired of the bullshit""."" That's actually pretty freakin' badass right there. The rest?...nah. The action scenes and the few instances of good character dialog can't save this movie's horrible, pathetic plot, which really, REALLY reaches and falls totally short, even by it's own standards. It's not even really humorous, save for the Ice Cream Man bit. That was sorta funny...till his jaw stretched.In fact, I can sum up the whole movie like that. It was sorta good. But then it stretched out after the first forty minutes and started sucking. I'd say 'rent it', but alas, it's barely out of theaters.If you think you can stomach the ridiculous plot, you may want to check it out. I'd flip a coin over it...but hey, that's just me.",Legion
383,aaronsloanv,Bad Lucad,3,27 April 2019,"Looking objectively, not at Scriptural accuracy, not terrible. If just for entertainment purposes, Lucas Black is still so horrible. His ineptitude at acting is a distraction from the whole movie.",Legion
