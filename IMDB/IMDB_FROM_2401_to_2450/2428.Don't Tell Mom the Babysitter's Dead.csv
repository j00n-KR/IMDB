0,Prismark10,Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead,3,6 June 2020,Sue Ellen Crandell (Christina Applegate) a 17-year-old high school graduate who fakes her resume and gets a job as an executive assistant in the clothing industry.All because her mother has gone to Australia for a vacation and left an elderly lady in charge of her and four siblings. However the babysitter soon dies and Sue Ellen has to make ends meet for the rest of the kids.What I thought would be a zany comedy in the style of Weekend at Bernie's turns out to be Working Girl lite for teenagers.A bait and switch from what you expect from the movie poster.Applegate is winsome but this is a half baked story which is a teen girl romantic comedy than something aimed at a wider child audience.,Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
1,Woodyanders,Delightful teen comedy,8,22 March 2019,"Teenager Sue Ellen (an excellent and appealing performance by the ravishing Christina Applegate) has to go get a job and become a part of the hectic white collar office rat race in order to raise enough money to take care of both herself and her other siblings after mean old babysitter Mrs. Sturak (a memorably nasty turn by Eda Reiss Merin) suddenly croaks.Director Stephen Herek, working from a witty script by Neil Landau and Tara Ison, keeps the enjoyable story zipping along at a brisk pace as well as maintains an engaging lighthearted tone throughout. Applegate makes for a wonderfully spunky and personable lead, looks like a million bucks in various fancy designer threads, and nicely handles the arc of her character becoming more mature and responsible as the narrative unfolds. Moreover, it's acted with zest by an enthusiastic cast: Joanna Cassidy as friendly boss Rose Lindsay, John Getz as the smarmy Gus, Josh Charles as the affable Bryan, Keith Coogan as rowdy pothead headbanger brother Kenny, David Duchovny as pushy jerk Bruce, Kimmy Robertson as the perky Cathy, Jayne Brook as the snarky Carolyn, and Danielle Harris as the scrappy Melissa. Further galvanized by a spirited soundtrack, this baby overall rates as a total treat.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
2,moonspinner55,Curiously ditches its darkly comic overtures midway for teen fantasy...,2,12 December 2009,"Rambunctious teenagers, left alone with a cantankerous guardian while Mom is away, must fend for themselves after the old crone croaks (they use the dirty dishes for target practice: ""The dishes are done, man!""). Airheads antics for an undiscriminating target audience, although Christina Applegate approaches the limp material with a dry resolve which is admirable and appealing; playing the eldest of the colorful clan, she rises far above the script and general handling. Second-half of the movie takes a sharp turn into big-business waters which, while too klutzy to be called satire, nearly achieves a certain unsteady charm. *1/2 from ****",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
3,BandSAboutMovies,Silly,7,7 April 2019,"Before directing movies like Mr. Holland's Opus, The Mighty Ducks, the live action 101 Dalmatians, Rock Star and Life or Something Like It, Stephen Herek was behind movies like Critters, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and this film.Sue Ellen Crandell (Christina Applegate) is 17 and stuck at home while her mother goes to Australia and her friends go to Europe. Now, she's in charge of her 16-year-old stoner metalhead brother Kenny, 14-year-old Zach, 13-year-old Melissa (Halloween franchise star Danielle Harris) and 11-year-old Walter (Robert Hy Gorman, Sometimes They Come Back and Leprechan).Her mom hires a babysitter for the summer named Mrs. Sturak, who ends up being mean to everyone until she dies from a heart attack. So they do what anyone else would: they put her in a trunk and send her to a funeral home.They screwed up in one major way: the old lady's body had all the money. Sue Ellen tries to work at Clown Dog and falls for Bryan, but quits because of the manager. She then makes a fake resume for a job at General Apparel West, where she works as an executive assistant, for Rose Lindsey (Joanna Cassidy, The Glove, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?).This pisses off Carolyn and Bruce (David Duchovny), two young workers who hate that she's jumped ahead of them. Of course, this being a teen movie, Carolyn and Bryan end up being brother and sister.There's so much going on in this movie: drugs, kids falling off the roof, car stealing drag queens and a fashion show. Of course, everything works out fine. It's a teen comedy. That's how it works.Production was nearly shut down to the actor who played Zach - Christopher Pettiet - having issues with drugs. They cut his scenes down so that they could finish the film. Sadly, he died nine years later of an accidental drug overdose.Keith Coogan, who played Kenny, ended up being in two movies where parents were nowhere to be found. That's because he's also in Adventures in Babysitting.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

5,preppy-3,Really stupid but I LOVED it!,8,1 November 1999,"OK the premise is dumb--A mom is going on vacation to Australia for two months. She has five children and leaves them with a tyrannical babysitter. The babysitter dies (of natural causes) within the first 15 minutes and the kids basically have to live alone all summer...but need money for food. The oldest one is 17 year old Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate)and she easily gets an executive position (just like real life, right?) at a fashion agency and, naturally, is incredible at her job. And her brothers and sisters learn values from her example...Sounds horrible, but it's well-acted (especially Applegate and a drop dead gorgeous Joanna Cassidy), it moves quickly, is very funny, has a great soundtrack of new AND old songs and I enjoyed every minute of it! Not a great movie by any means, but if you can turn off your brain for 2 hours, you'll really enjoy it!",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

7,view_and_review,Older Sister is a Better Mother,3,28 March 2020,"The whole brood of kids were lazy and disrespectful, but somehow we knew that would change by movie's end. All it would take is the mother going on vacation for two months, the babysitter dying, and them running out of money to live on.Babysitter is dead, Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) gets a job at a fashion agency as an executive assistant because of a bogus resume, she dates the spurned receptionist's younger brother, her boss's boyfriend is infatuated with her, and she's ""borrowed"" all of the petty cash money from the company. The whole situation was a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. Still, a happy ending because she and the other badass kids learned self-respect and cleaned up their act and she wowed clients to boost her company's sales.I don't know what the point of this movie was-- kids will behave if their older sister acts responsibly? Older sisters make better mothers? Parents should take a two month break from their kids? I don't know.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
8,gridoon2021,"One of the worst ""comedies"" of the early 1990s",2,26 June 2016,"It is tempting to state that the title of this movie is the funniest thing about it, but that would be inaccurate: it is the ONLY funny thing about it. It is also a very misleading title: after the first 10 minutes, the dead babysitter is forgotten about until the very last scene. It has a drab look (it looks made for TV, it's surprising that it got theatrical distribution), an amazingly aimless script, and dismal direction. There is nothing remotely believable, witty, and most importantly funny, about any of it. The character ""Kenny"" deserves to be shot. Ed O' Neill (as Al Bundy) joked about how terrible ""Dutch"" (which I haven't seen) was a couple of times on ""Married With Children"", I wonder why Christina Applegate (who tones down her attractiveness considerably here) never mentioned this movie on that show. Maybe she would rather forget it ever happened. 0.5 out of 4 stars.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
9,FlashCallahan,She doesn't look dead.....,6,1 August 2015,"Mrs Crandall goes on an extended holiday to Australia for the summer. Her children are first delighted but then find that Mom has hired the babysitter from hell to stay with them. When the sitter dies from a cardiac arrest, they deposit the body at a mortuary only to discover all their summer expense money was in her purse. The kids must find a way to survive the summer without mom or her money. This means actual work.......What could have been a macabre twist on the teen comedy blow out of the late eighties/early nineties,just reverts back to your atypical, nuts and bolts comedy at the beginning of the second act.From the one sheet to the plot summary, I was expecting a farcical comedy about the youngsters trying to keep the death of their sitter secret, whilst trying to hide the fact from neighbours, friends etc...And while this is true to some extent, the main focus is Applegate lying her way to the top and letting her pseudo career taking over her teen life. A sort of Taking Care Of Business meets Vice Versa type combination.And for that part of the narrative, it works for the majority, but it's just too predictable, too safe, and too cute to live up to its brilliant title.The cast are fine, the family are the same carbon copy family you find in every movie of this type, and features the same 'villains' who are trying to bring the main character down for their benefits you'd again find in this sub-genre.So the film carries a feeling of déjà Vu which is a little disheartening.So all in all, it's just another atypical teen comedy, with a couple of laughs.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
10,Rainey-Dawn,A No-Brainier Comedy,7,28 June 2014,"This is a funny no-brainier comedy with a group of kids about as dorky as the cast from ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", not quite as stylish as clan from ""The Breakfast Club"" and not as cool as the gang from ""Grease"". But this group does have a way of making you laugh in-spite the fact the babysitter is dead. While you are grabbing a bit of fast food on the way home be sure to pick up this movie too. It is a good watch if you are wanting to see a stupid but funny teenage packed comedy flick. This movie may make a good double-flick night with ""Weekend at Bernie's"" or ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"". 7/10",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

12,bensonmum2,"""I'm right on top of that Rose.""",7,23 December 2017,"When Mom Crandell decides to take the Summer off for an Australian vacation without her children, she hires a babysitter to oversee things. Mom is barely out of the country when the babysitter turns up dead. The kids, led by 17 year old Sue Ellen or ""Swell"" (Christina Applegate), decide they can take care of themselves. Using a copied resume, Swell is soon on her way up the career ladder in the fashion industry. With little help at home from her siblings, a new boyfriend, a failing company, and co-workers out to get her, Swell's got her hands full if she's to successfully navigate her Summer.I don't think I've seen Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead in something like 20 years. I was happy to discover that, for the most part, the film holds up well. The comedy still works. Swell's interactions with her co-workers are often very funny. I got a real kick out of seeing a young David Duchovny working to thwart Swell. Or the way Swell pulls the wool over her boss's eyes time after time. Good stuff! The exception is Gus (John Getz) repeatedly hitting on Swell. Really cringey. I've always enjoyed Christina Applegate and here she's as good as ever. I wish she would have done more of this kind of film in the 90s. It suits her. I'm guessing that her role in Married with Children negatively typecast her. Other big pluses in this movie are some child actors who can actually act, life lessons that aren't driven home with a heavy hand, and some nice musical selections. The ending is something of a head scratcher. Even after being discovered as a fake, Swell is offered, but turns down, the chance to continue her career. Why? It's never made sense to me. Still, Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead is a solid movie. Another thing I really enjoyed while watching Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead were all the late 80s / early 90s trappings. Shoulder pads, bright colors, big hair - the nostalgia just flowed over me. But the thing that really stood out was all the smoking. I forgot how much people used to smoke in movies. Seeing ""17"" year old Swell smoking non-stop really brought that home. You wouldn't see that today. It's definitely a product of its time.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
13,The-Sarkologist,Actually a really good and involved movie,7,6 January 2012,"This is a very clever movie. It is not one that would go down as a classic movie, but it is still very clever and somewhat original. On one hand the movie is about the teenage desire to be free and be able to do what they want all through summer. On the other hand it is about a group of kids who are rudely thrust into the adult world and suddenly discover that life isn't the party that they expected it to be. The mother of five children is going on a holiday to Australia during summer. The kids expect that they will look after themselves, but what they don't know is that their mother hired a babysitter. From the first instances in the movie we see that the kids are lazy, insolent, and generally don't care about anything and are not willing to help. The babysitter on the other hand is incredibly totalitarian and forces the kids into line. That is until she see Kenneth's room and dies of a heart attack because of it. The children think that this is great until they realise they have no money. The Babysitter had the money on her when they dumped her at the morgue, and thus they have no food and no money for the two months that their mother is away. The solution is that Sue-ellen or Kenneth get a job. Sue-Ellen looses the toss and must work. After working at a Clown Dog restaurant and hating it, Sue-Ellen makes up a resume and gets a job as an Executive Assistant to the Vice-President at a uniform design company. What starts off as a thrill for Sue-Ellen suddenly pushes her into the world of adulthood. She must deal with jealous employees of whose job she stole and fend of the sleazy advances of a co-worker named Gus. I guess we can delve deep into what happens in the plot because there is always something happening. Sue-Ellen, who is the main character, is not only trying to cope in an adult world with a naive attitude, but she is also trying to hold onto a boyfriend while trying to hide the fact that she is masquerading as a 28 year old, and the fact that the receptionist who hates Sue-Ellen is the guy's sister does not help. What we see though is how the characters grow. Sue-Ellen begins to discover what it is like to be a mother. Her mother knows that her children steal cash from her, but Sue-Ellen, in her naivety, does not expect this and is ripped off over three thousand dollars. The house becomes more messier as the trash piles up while the kids do nothing. Kenneth, who spends his time getting stoned with his friends, is also slowly thrust into adulthood, and quite reluctantly at that. It is only when they are faced with a long time in gaol that they begin to rise above what they were. By the end we see that Sue-Ellen, who wanted to waste the summer away on the beach, has now come to understand what life is really about and has made her decisions while Kenneth realises that school is not a bludge and that his results are important. He goes from a messy druggie to a respectable gentleman who ends up with a woman that he could never have. The final scene is clever with their mother returning home to a party, but not any sort of party. The cliché is that parents walk in on a wild drug party where the music is loud and people are drunk and behaving like hooligans. In this movie the party is very sophisticated with many respectable people and a lot of money floating around. Though quite shocked at what is actually going on, it is still a party. Yet we discover that Sue-Ellen's and Kenneth's attitude to their mother has changed. In the end, it seems that everybody has forgotten that the babysitter ever was there, including the audience. Favourite Quote: She was the best friend that I ever had. You never even knew her. Yes, but she left us all of her money.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
14,Movie Nuttball,Actually a really good film!,10,5 September 2005,"Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead is a good film that has a good cast which includes Christina Applegate, Joanna Cassidy, John Getz, Josh Charles, Keith Coogan, Concetta Tomei, David Duchovny, Kimmy Robertson, Jayne Brook, Eda Reiss Merin, Robert Hy Gorman, Danielle Harris, Christopher Pettiet, Chris Claridge, Jeff Bollow, and Michael Kopelow! The acting by all of these actors is very good. Applegate and Cassidy are really excellent in this film. I thought that they performed good. The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising. The movie is filmed very good. The music is great by David Newman. The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end. This is a very good and thrilling film.

15,digitalbeachbum,Has not aged well,3,22 April 2020,"This movie, which came out in 1991, stars Christina Applegate as the high school senior who is left at home with her three siblings, and the elderly babysitter who dies, leaves them home alone with out adult supervision for two months while the mom is vacationing in Australia.The script is terrible. It is filled with deus ex machina and fallacies. Yes, it is supposed to be a comedy from the 90's but the stupidity of the characters and they forced script is boring. The characters develop one dimensionally. They don't have any motivation to be better.The script could have been improved if they also did not promote stealing, lying and cheating. Three things which people should learn are wrong, but these characters never really learn their lesson and go unpunished.I liked a few individual scenes which had some fun to them, but the rest of it was unrealistic and did not progress with any continuity. The editing was terrible. The direction was terrible, but the acting was what it was and I don't blame the actors for the crappy movie.Note that David Duchovny has a bit part and this is his 7th appearance in a production. The rest of the cast is forgettable and that's exactly what they last 30 years has done to them.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
16,insomniac_rod,Gotta love the early 90's obscurity.,6,6 December 2009,"What do I mean? This movie delivers silly situations derived by a not so family oriented situation. I mean, it isn't funny to have a dead babysitter! But the black humor inserted is amusing. Fortunately for the plot, that situation just serves as a transition for the real fun to begin. Through the eyes of the 5 children we'll get adventures and some ""Home Alone"" situations.The humor is silly but entertaining. I can't say much about the over the top situations except that it was a common denominator in early 90's teen comedies.This feels like the 80's but with a special ""vibe"" from early 90's, the transitional era where things were confusing.Christina Applegate delivers a fine performance as the sassy and brave big daughter. I love the girl. She carries on her back the movie.Overall, I recommend this movie for those who enjoy 80's teen humor. This time, with a little spice from the 90's.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

18,GOWBTW,Funny to say the least!,6,13 November 2008,"Following to her success with ""Married..With Children"" Christina Applegate tries her luck with the big screen. In this movie, she plays a teenager who ends up being the sitter of her siblings after the sudden passing of the hired caretaker. Her mother(Joanna Cassidy) was going overseas for vacation and she hired a tyrannical caretaker who ended up dying of a heart attack when she took a look at the brother's room. In order to get some money after unwittingly burying it with the hag, she gets herself a job, buy conning her way to get it. The plan worked, and she now works for a a fashion company who would later have a fashion show in her mother's yard, until she gets back from her vacation! This movie was a a lot of fun, Sue Ellen is no Kelly Bundy. And Joanna Cassidy character should learn to be more open-minded on what her daughter should do in her life, however, she's a bit clueless about the babysitter she hired. At least Sue Ellen could have said, ""Mom, she had a family emergency, death in the family.""

19,smatysia,It is what it is,6,7 June 2004,"If you don't have unrealistic expectations of this film, then it can be OK. Amusing to see David Duchovny in a small, role as a slacker. But the whole thing is an obvious vehicle for Christina Applegate. And she was tremendous eye candy throughout. I might not have finished watching this one if not for her amazing gorgeousity. (It's a word! Look it up!) And her acting was fine, too, she had a lot more to work with than in her supporting role as Kelly Bundy on ""Married With Children"". It's too bad she hasn't gotten too many good roles in recent years, but check her out in ""The Sweetest Thing"" with Cameron Diaz. The supporting cast was generally adequate, with the exception of John Getz.

20,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Excellent comedy about surviving on your own when you're a minor!,10,25 July 2006,"DON'T TELL MOM THE BABYSITTER'S DEAD, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy about surviving on your own when you're a minor!

Also, if you ask me, Carolyn (Jayne Brook) was an absolute bitch! On the other hand, every mishap that occurred after Mrs. Sturak's death did was absolutely hilarious. Also, what Sue Ellen (Christina Applegate) did was absolutely brave. If I were her, I'd probably do the same thing. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade.

21,jfgibson73,I found nothing to enjoy,2,22 January 2011,"This movie was nothing like what I expected it to be. It looked to me like a movie where the kids get the run of the house and go crazy, throwing parties and doing outrageous, irresponsible things. It ended up being closer to Working Girl: the oldest teen has to get a job and falls backwards into an upwardly mobile fashion career. The responsibilities of maintaining the house eventually turn each of the children into productive citizens.What bothered me wasn't so much the story as the fact that almost nothing was funny. It ended up being closer to a drama. The performances were cartoonish, but at the same time, weren't into so-bad-they're-funny territory (except for the guy who played Gus. Someone should have seen this movie and realized the potential this actor had as a physical comedian).Once in a while, we get a good line or two, like when the brother and sister were arguing like a married couple. My opinion was that it was an idea with good potential that was completely mishandled.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

It just didn't amount to much. The premise has a lot of potential, but it doesn't feel like they scratched the surface of what this movie could have been.The jokes hit about have the time, but that's mostly because its the same joke done poorly: ""The kids are stupid."", ""She's a kid working an adult job, AND NOBODY KNOWS!"", ""She's between a corn dog and a hard place.""And while I can see that the movie wants me to laugh at the situational comedy its manufactured....situational comedy is funny because it feels natural. If I tell you I took a bowling ball to the top of the Empire State building, and then I dropped it: its not funny because that must have been what I intended to do all along, otherwise why would I have brought the bowling ball up there. (That situation is only funny if I actually only dropped it on my foot, and now my toe REALLY hurts, but that's still a bad story, even if it's a little funny.)I'm just saying, you're not missing anything by skipping this if you have seen it in the past 20 years.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
26,PredragReviews,"""Right on Top of that Rose!""",8,10 June 2016,"""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" is an all-time comedy great. It shows that when you work hard and work together how you can get something done. When Sue Ellen, Walter, Kenny, and Melissa's mother goes to Australia for the summer they are left home with a babysitter. She's not any ordinary babysitter, she's and old lady that is rule oriented and is very, very strict. The kids decide that they have had enough and when Sue Ellen, the oldest of the kids, goes down to talk to her, she is found dead. They have no money and Sue Ellen is working for a clothing company for the summer. Thus starts a funny and often touching comedy. What first looks like a straight forward comedy manages to be a lot more. The fish-out-of-water scenario at work rapidly transforms into a realization of how restricting an adult life can be.Despite plot holes and a too rapid chain of events (this film will never join any good ""classic videos"" collection) that make everything too convent, this is a good movie for generation X. Younger audiences especially accustomed to extensive background checks (ala social media... etc.) are going to have a very hard time swallowing the pre-internet resume, where people actually just turned in a hard copy resume and their background was not actually given a careful look-over. Featuring a great cast of actors such as Joanna Cassidy and Keith Coogan (""Adventures in Babysitting""), ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter is Dead"" is a grown-up version of ""Home Alone"" for teens. Amusing, funny, and entertaining, it was Applegate's only feature-film hit. While she made other low-cost films such as ""Streets"", this film happens to be her best work outside from her work on ""Married... With Children.."" If you are looking for a great flick for the family this is it.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
27,Sandcooler,Tough to hate,7,17 April 2010,"You can't really have anything against this movie, because it's just incredibly harmless fun. The moral lessons that glue this movie together are taken straight from after-school specials, but they are delivered in such a delightful way that they almost become bearable. Almost. The humour is very creative and there are a lot of laughs, then again some of the best jokes are probably unintentional ones. I especially love the scene in which it turns out Sue Ellen has a knack for designing fashion, to which they show us the absolute most hideous clothes ever made in this universe. Ah, the early 90s, how I love thee and all thy weirdness. The cast does very well, kind of a shame none of them ever made it to the A-list. Christina Applegate might just be the most underrated actress in Hollywood, but oh well. Generally I'm not too fond of these movies with an oh-so-important message, but I gladly make an exception for this one.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
28,pc95,Not as bad as it's average vote,7,25 October 2010,"While ""Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead"" is no masterpiece, it's 5.5 rating is a bit harsh for this early 90s movie that I remember watching during High School. Caught it at a Hotel with HBO recently and I thought I'd be cringing a lot, but it has it's entertaining moments and quite a few chuckles. It's almost a homage to John Hughes type movies. There's a lot of adult vs. teenagers vs kids humor, and some of the witty dialog that mimmicks Hughes scripts in movies like ""Uncle Buck"". Here Christina Applegate who never really launched in the movie-world, holds her own pretty well, although she doesn't quite cut-it believable as a 17 year old. I liked the romance and subterfuge she threw at her crush and all the office antics and characters. You can see some of Office Space like goof-balls and behavior in this movie a good 8 years before the Mike Judge Masterpiece came out. Anyway, this deserves a higher rating - it still clings to some 80'ness in a fond way.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

If you want that go watch a three hour Ingmar Bergman film but if you want a breezy, silly comedy with good performances and a snappy pace than this is for you.The whole setup is preposterous but so are many 80 & 90's comedies, Adventures in Babysitting, Home Alone etc, but once this one gets past its bumpy intro scenes it actually becomes a more focused story of a young girl finding her way through unexpected responsibilities.It helps a great deal that the cast headed by two very good actresses. Christina Applegate as Sue Ellen the young teen who finds out she is more resourceful than she realized and the marvelous Joanna Cassidy as Rose, her new boss. Keith Coogan is also a lot of fun as stoner brother Kenny who belatedly grows up. Besides the good performances the film is filled with some amusing quotes, enjoyable situations and a flashback to 90's fashion. A pleasant diversion but again don't expect anything high toned and you'll enjoy the ride.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

When the babysitter dies, they decide not to tell their mother and spoil her vacation.Sue Ellen soon realises that she needs to get a job and support her siblings, but she soon learns that being an adult is not all that easy.With a fine performance from Christina and good support from the rest of cast this turns out to be a really enjoyable film that is effortlessly funny throughout.6/10",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
31,michaeltrivedi,Pretty Excellent,7,30 November 2019,"This movie was really good. I randomly watched it on Netflix, and it really impressed me. The movie ended on a weak note, but even that was warranted. Nothing else to say except this was one good watch. It ended as soon as it started, and I was in almost all the way through.The movie is about a mother who leaves town, leaving her five kids with an old babysitter. When the sitter dies, they must fend for themselves. They get into a lot of trouble, but it all works out at the end of the day.It was good. Nothing was exceptional. It was just straightforward fun. There were no serious situations to get out of, and no great lessons worth learning. Christina Applegate did not look that attractive in this, and I believe she was trying to pose as the ""nice girl."" David Duchovny makes an appearance too, but this was probably before his X-Files fame. The movie takes place in LA which is a plus.

Danielle Harris, Christina Applegate, and Joanna Cassidy are good although Joanna's haircut was a bad choice. David Duchovny can also be seen in an early role with bad hair. A little residual eighties bubbling to the surface. This is again that time in the late eighties and early nineties where all the colors are oddly, unnaturally dark. Josh Charles just doesn't come off very charming. I never liked him in this movie. He looks like he could pass for a Bundy with his nose which makes him creepy. There are too many caricatures in this movie as well. The dork with the heart of gold. The stoner escaping responsibility. The fickle yet smart girl. The evil babysitter. Yawn. I also can't stand the kids outsmarting the adults in cute ways genre like Catch That Kid. If I want uncontrollable cute, I will play with my dog.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

Newmeyer....Director Stephen Herek, Screnplay Neil Landau, Tara Ison.Comedy on film was much better 16-20 years ago, as with this 1991 film from Director Stephen Herek. ""Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead"" was successful at the box office and before long it was not only on VHS but even on television (Fox 11 aired this film owing to the fact its star Christina Applegate was a cast member in their hit show ""Married With Children"".) Applegate portrays Sue Ellen Crandell, the spoiled daughter of a single mother (Concetta Tomei) who takes off on much needed three-month vacation for the summer. The siblings are unruly, the eldest is lazy, irresponsible freeloading ""rocker"" type, and when the mother takes off on her vacation, they are confident they will enjoy freedom. But the mother hires a babysitter, an elderly woman, who is tough on them. It's not long before she has a heart attack and dies. It's up to Sue Ellen to support her siblings by taking a job in clothing/fashion production. Lying in her resume, she accidentally lands a job as the personal assistant to the editor Rose Lindsey (Joanna Cassidy), striking up jealousies and rivalries with co-workers Carolyn and Bruce (Jayne Brook and David Duchovny). It's nice to see David Duchovny before his X-files fame but the part is no big thing. The real star here is Christina Applegate who matures from irresponsible teen to working adult. The plot may be far-fetched but it works owing to a good script and fine acting. Plenty of funny lines, a little romance, and a coming-of-age story makes this a winning comedy.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
34,policy134,Christina Applegate is a smart woman,5,19 May 2011,"This is a very average movie with a very, even for that time, tired old plot. Not unbelievable, mind you, but you have seen this story in sooo many mid-80s comedies, the worst being ""The Secret of My Success"" with Michael J. Fox. That movie was insanely farcical, though.Here, the farce is toned down. There is an extremely off sequence at the start which involves the title of the movie. It doesn't seem to fit in with the rest of the story. It is more of the Marx Bros. screwball comedy variety, where the rest belongs more in the vein of family comedy.Christina Applegate, who is a smart woman, played a very dumb blonde on the hit sitcom ""Married with Children"" as most everybody knows. She finally got a part where she was serviced well. Not that her character here is a genius, but she gets to play all tangents: Surly, upbeat, successful and finally brought down. Sorry to say that the movie isn't that compelling as she is. There is an abundance of stock characters, like the one played by John Getz and even the one played by the mostly appealing, Joanna Cassidy. I loved her in Who Framed Roger Rabbitt and she had a great recurring character on Boston Legal as Denny Crane's scheming fianceé. The reason I find her a stock character is that she appears to be a smart woman but is brought down by her inability to see through Sue Ellen (Applegate) at the very beginning. Then again, if she did, the movie would be over.There are some good characters, like the one played by Keith Coogan. He definitely shows range as he is playing two characters with equal aplomb, the loser and the reformed. I did find his transformation believable. Applegate's transformation is a little forced. Yes, we know that she has to make amends to all the people she did wrong, including her mother. It sounds like a John Hughes coming of age tale, and you know what? It is. But just because something worked for him, doesn't necessarily mean that it is any better the second, third, fourth time.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

36,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,7 February 2005,"A brilliant look at early nineties family, and more importantly teen life. Firstly, teen movies of today all seem to be set in school, and involve getting a date or a shag. Usually every character is hollow except the main one who we are supposed to cheer for, but more often than not they are hollow too. The actors are chosen for their looks and although they mostly give competent performances, they give nothing special, the film offers no insight, and nothing much happens. This is why Buffy (series) shone so greatly-brilliant stories, brilliant acting, extremely well developed characters. But it probably isn't fair to compare a long running TV show to a crappy film. However, DTMTBD proves that teen comedies do not have to be hollow, and lack humour, but can have a good story, good performances, many funny moments, and offer a message about life other than the rubbish spouted nowadays.DTMTBD is set in the summer holidays, far from school, just the way we like it. The Crandalls are a large, fatherless family, and their mom needs a break, going to Europe for the whole summer. The 5 children believe they are going to be left alone to party etc for 3 months, but of course that does not happen, and they each learn a lesson about life. It may sound cheesy, but the dark humour ensures that there is a balance. Sue Ellen is the oldest, but is only 17, and therefore mum hires a babysitter. At first it seems that the kids will still be able to do as they please, but it turns out that the babysitter has been sent from the deepest darkest depths of Hell. (met. speak) She sets down rules, chores and is going to prevent them from having any fun.However, when she sees Kenny's (oldest son) room she has a heart-attack and dies. They decide to get rid of the body, in a good, respectful way, and continue with their lives-taking her car too of course. All goes well until the car, along with their money is stolen. Their summer allowance is gone 1 week in, but rather than give in to their mum they decide to struggle on. Sue Ellen gets a job, the rest mess about, and soon tensions arise. Melissa (danielle Harris) is annoyed because no-one came to her baseball match, while the others struggle with girls and personal injuries. Sue Ellen has no clue about her job, lying on her CV, but the money is rolling in, and she has her own boy troubles. Sue-Ellen comes to the rescue of her boss, deciding to hold a fashion show at her house, where the rest of the family finally help out. Of course, nothing goes smoothly.It is a light-hearted look at teen life, fear of the future, wanting responsibility but not knowing how to cope with it, trying to balance a job, friends, family, work, boyfriend etc, but the often dark humour is very funny. Kenny gives many funny moments, getting the dog stoned and shooting the dishes rather than cleaning them, while Danielle Harris gives another brilliant performance in a small role. Applegate is perfect, delivering her lines with smooth wit and sarcasm, and showing the pressure she is under with skill. Other funny moments involve Sue-Ellen' antics with her boss's lover, and there are plenty of one-liners. The one about the cucumber and the one about Santa Barbara are good. Kenny learns that he can still be cool if he goes to school, and that life is not for sitting around, while Sue-Ellen learns that trying to grow up too quick can be dangerous. The movie says that None of us really grow up, we just get older and while this happens we should never forget who we are. As silly as it sounds it is true none the less, and few films show this better. 10 out of 10",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
37,PeterRoeder,Very inspiring movie,7,10 March 2008,"I thought this was a very funny teenage-family movies in the 80s style although it was finished in 1991. Perhaps the title is a bit stupid and difficult to remember. Christina Applegate is really beautiful and all things considered I thought this movie gave a good picture of how it is like to make it on your own without the support of grownups. Something I am still trying to do at the age of almost 32, ha ha. Sue Ellen's boyfriend is almost Holden Caulfieldian in his outlook on life and all in all this movie is a great view into a time before the home computer got customary, internet, cell phones and so forth.

39,Gubby-Allen,OK,5,30 September 2003,"Pretty run-of-the-mill, typical late 1980's film. Never hilarious, but fun & likeable in parts. It's a pretty far fetched plot, but keeps realistic enough to just about remain enjoyable throughout. It does suffer from a couple of long lulls where they had to stretch out the plot to last 90 minutes. The only real problem I head was the character Kenny, there were points where he needed a good smack in the mouth, but typically and thankfully he & all ended up ok.

41,richspenc,Babysitter died too soon,6,17 March 2017,"The story of a vicious bitter old lady babysitting should not have been cut so short. First of all, the previews in the movie theaters at the time made out most of the preview misleading the audiences to believe that the babysitter would take up a bigger part of the movie. Secondly, they set up several good scenes with the babysitter (Eda Reiss Meringue) (such as her angrily stopping letting the kids watch TV and making them write book reports, for example on the life of the aardvark) and then just dropped them. Third, the writers made the old lady drop dead before the oldest punk rock kid Kenny (Keith Coogan) ever even saw her. I guess that at least set up a rather amusing joke where after she died, Kenny saying ""yes, she was a great babysitter"". I liked that. Kenny saying that after he first of all, he never saw her, and secondly, she was hardly great. Also sort of amusing was the implication that the old lady seeing Kenny's bedroom is what made her die. A bedroom that was super messy, with heavy metal playing, posters of half naked girls (Samantha Fox (she was a hot late 80s girl)), and with stashes of weed visible. I liked Kenny, but him continuously yelling ""rock and roll!"" was so cliché, even back then. Christina Applegate I always found super hot, after always watching her on ""Married with children"". Some of this movie was pretty innocent and feel good, but some of it was dumb too. When the kid's mom goes on a two month summer vacation to Australia and leave the kids with a sadistic old lady, much to Christina's (Sue Ellen, Sue El, Swell; her name shortened) protest, we get a ten minute long tops session of the babysitters scenes before she dies. Then, after a couple more amusing bits of the kids leaving a trunk with her body in it with message ""nice old lady inside, died of natural causes"" at the funeral home, and then too late realizing that they left the money on the dead babysitters person, they are all stuck and broke with almost two more months before mom comes home. Then the remainder, the main story of the film starts, Swell needing to work to support everyone for the next two months. Kenny was selfish there refusing to find a job too making Swell take on that full role. But I guess Kenny was needed to stay home and watch the little ones, even though he doesn't do a good job of that, getting stoned with his buddies in his room while one of the little ones plays on the roof, falls off and breaks his leg. The main story with Swell working at an office is pretty good but not real good, as of the short section of working at Happy face's (Happy face is the goofy overly eager manager) Clown Dog fast food where she meets Brian (Josh Charles). Her and Brian have a sort of cheesy love story (they hang out at the beach and also (please!) bounce around a department store on big bouncy balls, the type you see 7 year olds on). Brian also thinks his Clown Dog van makes him a hero when he comes to pick up the stranded kids outside of Chucky Cheeses when (chortle), Liza Mineli and Maralyn Monroe (well, thieves in those celebrities' masks) steal the kid's (well, the ""borrowed"" babysitter's) car. Brian gets suspicious of Swell cause she won't tell him where she works, reason being he's Karen's (Jayne Brook) brother. Karen is the super bitchy receptionist would-be executive assistant at the clothing company that gets her job taken away from Swell. Swell got the high level job through lying big time on her resume. Karen obviously now has a pretty major grudge towards Swell. I sort of understand Karen being sore with Swell since she pushed, as a newbie, ahead of someone who's been with the company for a while and grabbed a high level position away from her who was someone that the executive position was previously promised to. But Karen had already been unnecessarily rude to Swell before that happened when Swell innocently went to the wrong place to apply for a receptionist job. Executive Rose (Joan Cassidy) was initially the one who was gonna promote Karen to be her assistant but desperately didn't want to due to Rose admitting that Karen is usually a very difficult person to get along with. So Karen still needs to take some responsibility for having had such a bad attitude towards people. It's still not right to break a promise to someone you promised a promotion to, but there's no excuse for Karen being such a bitch in general to begin with. I'd say both parties were at some fault here. Another sleazy character was Gus (John Getz), a guy that Rose was involved with but decided to start hitting on Swell behind her back. Gus was sleazy since A), Swell made it clear she wasn't interested in him but he still pursued her anyway, and B), Gus was cheating on Rose. You can see Gus's sleaziness also when he takes Swell to a fancy Beverly Hills restaurant for lunch, buys her martinis (waiter snobbily to Swell: ""sweet..or..dry?"") and tells Swell in a sultry slobbering way ""you will love the chicken here, it's very 'tender'"". A couple other things kinda dumb: Swell taking the whole petty cash box home and the younger kids stealing lots of cash from it to buy expensive things like a vast entertainment system. The other dumb thing was Brian sobbing and pleading to take Swell back over the loud speaker of his Clown dog van outside of Swell's house completely oblivious to a big party with lots of people going on. Quite ridiculous don't ya think?",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

46,Nick Zbu,A confused little movie,5,26 June 2012,"While not a really bad movie, 'Babysitter' has a few issues that make me wonder if anybody making it knew what a depressing film they were making. The idea of a woman having to work to support her overpriviliged brat siblings is an interesting one, but really doesn't mesh with the way this film is promoted. And the promoted version seems a lot more fun than what turns out to be a very stupid Afterschool Special mixed with an abandoned whodunit combined with a coming-of-age story that really falls flat.What was the original point of this film? Did anybody really think that making a film aimed at teenagers in 1991 wanted to see someone from Married with Children slowly turn into Al Bundy live on the screen? Or that changing your stoner brother was the way to live life? I can understand what the movie wants to say--that you change into adulthood in ways you never thought possible--but it does so badly. The movie works when it's about the family dealing with their own issues. It fails when it tries to be Kelly Bundy's Smarter Twin Being All Career Woman.A quick look at the Trivia section of this fine website shows that this movie once had the loaded title 'The Real World.' Was this even supposed to be a comedy? Regardless, everybody in it does a good job. But I wonder what kind of movie they would have made if they tossed the preachy blue-collar indoctrination out the window and just had fun with it. The movie, as it stands, really seems like it's talking down to you right before it goes on about the four touchdowns it made in a single game.

53,mrsastor,Much better than is to be expected,8,1 June 2007,"I loved this movie, I found it very entertaining and would recommend it.I'm often surprised at the points people get hung up on in reviewing movies. They are, after all, FICTION. The main ""controversy"" surrounding this plot seems to be Sue Ellen's job. I have done office work for over 25 years and yes, it is entirely possible that Sue Ellen could have landed that position without too much trouble. Maybe not inside of five minutes at the first firm she walked into, but using a faked resume, as she was, she could have obtained a pretty soft office job without too much trouble. Some firms I've worked for would verify your more recent work experience, but many others never verify anything on a resume, and I've never once in all my years known of anyone to verify the education one claimed to have. Indeed, I've often kicked myself that I could have claimed to have some precious, worthless high dollar degree and no one would have questioned it.Beyond this, the movie is awfully good for this genre of film. We see the children unexpectedly learning valuable life lessons and it changing them into better people. It's really a rather wholesome movie considering the time period and target audience.

We have the hilarious slapstick comedy of covering up the death of an elderly babysitter, and a woman trying to find a way to save the company she works for (which is a movie that I personally wouldn't have cared for, but probably would've made a great chick flick), both of which could've easily carried themselves over an hour and a half each.Instead, all we get is a half-hour of comedy and an hour of boring Yuppie-ville Corporate America, with the plot of the first half-hour poking it's head every so often, mercilessly trying to remind us that we're supposed to be watching a comedy. But just as quickly as those every-so-often's come up, they disappear back into the void.And they should've done away with the 'no money, gotta get a job' plot device, as that was pretty much what killed the rest of this film. They could've developed a lot more comedy just out of them say... having a party and trashing the house, or relatives come looking for the babysitter, or mother comes home early, or from the fact that they should've just called an ambulance in the first place seeing as how the babysitter really did die of natural causes and they wouldn't have been in any trouble anyway, or any number of possible plot devices that could've been so much funnier than Christina Applegate parading around in Yuppie-land. And as for that part of the film being it's own movie, this section has a lot more detail than the first half. Just add a bit more character development to the supporting cast, and bam, you got that film.The acting is overall fairly decent though. Christina Applegate is definitely convincing as both the valley girl and the yuppie. Keith Coogan as Kenny and the hilarious pranks that him and his gang pull are sadly underused in my opinion, although his transformation from stoner slacker to Julia Child-obsessed chef throughout the film is one of the best parts of the film. Josh Charles (whom everybody would remember as anchor Dan Rydell from the show Sports Night) as the boyfriend Bryan does a fairly decent job here as well. Eda Reiss Merin as the elderly babysitter had me scared stiff. The actress also was sadly underused before the character's untimely death. I mean, come on. The title of the movie is based on this character. Had that been it's own movie (forsaking the Corporate America bit, as I suggested earlier), they could've developed the character a lot more. Maybe have her dole out some worse embarrassments and harsher punishments to the children before her death.Most of the actors in the latter part of the film were pretty stiff. The actress who played Carolyn should've been replaced, as it seemed that she read her lines like a wannabe actress in a poorly written commercial. I was however surprised to see David Duchovny (long before his triumphs on The X-Files & Californication) with the worst hair cut the 80's had to offer, and stiff as a board in the acting department.So basically that's it. 2 good premises, but one overall lousy film.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
56,westegg,A Modest Classic,8,30 August 2005,"I've watched this film over the years on cable, and it continues to be a very watchable, charming film even with inevitably dated elements. Those who think it the worst thing ever must not see many movies, particularly comedies. This one has an actual brain behind it, a dose of wit and effort to delineate actual characters. In that sense it towers above 97% of most teen-oriented comedies from the last twenty years. I'm pleased that it gets a sizable enough positive response here from viewers, because a film like this can easily be dismissed as a typical formula comedy from a certain era, but unlike many films of its time it retains a very nice appeal, thanks in large part to Christina Applegate. The whole cast is excellent, and overall it's a film that stands up to repeated viewings. How many films from 1991 can still do that?",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

58,johnfanning-53228,Fun Movie for the Family,8,15 August 2021,"I went to the movies and seen this with some friends as a kid. I enjoyed it 30 years ago and still enjoy it now. One of the things about this movie that is appealing now is that it was done in an age before social media, the internet, and cell phones (at least the ones we have today). The didn't just randomly text each other or post a bunch of stupid selfies. The oldest sister worked to support her siblings during the summer while stoner brother Kenny ""babysat"" the kids.The movie also ends in a positive, refreshing note, with Christina Applegate growing into adulthood much quicker (and with much success) after high school, Kenny cleaning up his act and turning to cooking as a new ""high"" opposed to using weed, and the younger siblings taking responsibility to clean up the house for a party designed to help their sister save the jobs of her co-workers.Only thing I did not enjoy in this movie was Josh Charles' character. He was annoying and did not seem to add much to the film other than a dull love interest for Sue Ellen (Applegate). By the end of this movie, you could tell she was too mature for this guy. Why date a Clown Dog delivery driver when she could have any guy she wanted?",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

But, as the first five minutes went by and we got to the babysitter 's death. Which I thought it was going to be committed by the kids and was thankful that they didn't. I love how shocked the women got freaked out by all the stuff in the house. I love all the typical 90's kid flicks clichés like the tomboy girl refusing to dress more like a girl or the funny little montage. I didn't enjoy the teen-aged brother using drugs and felt the movie should have gotten a PG-13 rating. But,I love how he changed from that to nice,cleaned-up, young man and taking responsibility. Anyways, I thought fashion show was funny for the idea for uniforms even though I can't imagine any school taking them up. But, however, I loved it for how the kids pulled it and grew up. It was nice to see mature teen film that doesn't deal with the search for sex.

She's still sexy, just not a party animal haha.

76,dellaroccokc,Terrible directing and overall a mess,2,1 August 2014,"So Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead (AKA The Secret to My Success 2: Electric Boogaloo) is one of the most shameless wannabee ripoffs I've seen. You can tell from the image that this movie has on IMDb. The pull quote from the top of the image reads ""Its Home Alone Times Five""...Whoever wrote that should be stripped of the right to free speech. It wants you to think that this movie has something to do with a bunch of kids and the fact that they have to deal with being ""home alone"". But it doesn't. There's 5 kids and the movie only deals with 2 of them. I say that because they're the only ones who have an arc. One of them plays baseball, one of them had a girlfriend at 11 years old but then didn't for reasons we don't know or care, and one of them fell off a roof. Wacky. So it begins with a quick intro to the two main characters, the oldest sister and brother. The brother is a stoner, and the sister...seems to be just a normal girl with normal problems one would have at her age. RANT ABOUT THE MOM: just about the worst person in the world. Seriously? You leave your 5 kids alone for 2 months? This is a premise no one can identify with. Because...WTF. She asked the babysitter if she knows there are 5 kids 1 minute before she leaves...So I'm going to skip over the babysitter part. Because its not important. The movie's title is about her dying, and its not the least bit important. There's no drama from this situation. You figure it can be almost like Weekend At Beernies, where they have to play like she's still alive to people. Like a relative comes by to check on them or whatever and they have to make it seem like she's there. But no, there's two scenes on the phone where the mom's asks where she is and they're just like ""uhhhhhhhh shes gone"".OK, so Kelly Bundy needs a job now to pay for food. Which is the only thing the movie shows as a need when the mom is away. Apparently the big house they live in is devoid of food when the mom leaves for 2 months. You figure this could be an amount that a fast food job could handle. But Kelly says F that I'm too good for this ish. So then she try's to get a high class job at a fashion...place. And she gets one under false pretense. But there's some mean lady trying to bring her down. This is pretty much the stakes of this movie, and why this movie fails. If she gets exposed, there is no bad thing that would happen. She would just lose her job, and her mom would come back a few days later and life would go back to normal. You could say that she was embezzling money and she would have gotten in trouble for that, but it's like 3 grand...maybe probation...not something a movie should be based around. Blah blah, the other kids make appearances here and there...blah blah, the stoner wonders if this life of ""Rock and Roll!!!"" is whats best...blah blah wait, is that David Duchovny? What is he doing here? He could have been written out and the movie would have preformed exactly the same. I guess I should just end this thing now. So Veronica Corningstone is going to save the company with her fashion sense. It has never been established that she has a superior fashion ability. She just grabs some clothes, and off she goes. You could have made this make sense in 30 seconds with a scene earlier in the movie with her displaying some sort of fashion opinion at a high end clothes store or something. Showing she has some sort of untapped potential at this. But nah.She for some reason decides to hold a fashion show at her house. You can debate that it was to save money which she didn't have, but that party looked like it cost a s-ton. This was a perfect opportunity to give all the kids a quick arc to show that they can do chores now. At the party everything goes fine til the boyfriend shows up. I didn't mention him before because he's not really important (they could have made him important but there is a 30 minute stretch where he's not mentioned or appears). He sees a house with 50 cars parked in front, doesn't recognize the signs that this might not be the best time to confess his love over a loudspeaker, and messes everything up. Doesn't matter because the Mom shows up and everything's exposed. Which results in nothing. Nothing at all... Listen, the point is that this movie has no purpose. It is two movies rolled into one, resulting in nothing. You can do a movie about a dead babysitter, and the crazy mishaps resulting in that, or you can do a movie about a girl trying to fake her way into high society...which is what they did. The problem is that we don't have any background or connection with this main character and the danger she's taking in lying about this job she's in. She's just doing it to make some food money. And she'll be OK in a couple of days when mommy gets home. And this is the director's fault. Somewhere he should have put more meaning in the characters. Giving them more of a reason to be better, or establishing that they are crappy to begin with. The older brother was this, but was done with the subtlety of a wrecking ball. Its your job to give this movie purpose and drive, and it pretty much lacks it all.",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead

79,tub83388,Nostalgia at its best,7,28 October 2013,"I remember watching this film when I was about ten and I loved it. I remember being motivated to see it in the first place because Married with children reigned supreme in our house and I loved Christina Applegate. In this movie she didn't disappoint either, as she was not only good in it, but played a character wildly different from mean, dim witted Kelly Bundy. Instead she played Sue Ellen Krandle a decent ,level headed, but restless young woman who is uncertain about her future. Sue Ellen has a contentious relationship with her siblings and mother,but she also is willing to strive for their approval and respect. In other words she is a regular seventeen year old. More mature than her siblings but not quite ready to take up the mantle of an adult. When her mother goes to Austraila, Sue Ellen thinks that she is going to have a care free summer of fun in the sun, when a woman comes to the door and her mother introduces... the babysitter. When mom leaves the seemingly sweet grandma like gem, reveals a nastily terrifying tyrant underneath, and Sue Ellen and her siblings try and keep cool heads. The old be careful what you wish for scenario surfaces when the baby sitter sees Sue Ellens punk brother's bedroom and is literally shocked to death. Sue Ellen finds the woman's corpse and to make a long story short her and her siblings are left for two months with out money or adult supervision. This movie is not perfect from a technical standpoint. It a predicable cheesy fantasy full of scenarios that in real life would be incrediblbly dark. However, for some reason, the acting, the engrossing action pact scenes and the love you have for the respectful a, fresh and resourceful sue Ellen and hate you have for the bad characters emotionally engross you.

I was hoping the show, Married with Children, would not bend her towards being typecast. My hope came through. She is smart and very talented. I am a huge fan of Christina for a couple of reasons. One is her acting abilities and the second one is when she met the riders that rode from San Francisco to Los Angeles, a few years back. I know she can do more and I hope she is given the opportunity to move forward. The supporting cast (and all crew members) who put this film together deserve praise and a raise. Just one short note: my son, who was about 12 years old at the time, was in his room, door closed and he was laughing and laughing. I knocked on the door, went in and watched Married with Children with him. I had never heard of the show. I know what it is now and watch all the repeats, every day! My son also got me started on the Simpsons. I had never heard of that show also. Go figure, my son gets me to critique the shows he likes and we are cool for the night...",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
88,mcwi4620,dropping dead sitter off at funeral home,9,4 January 2007,"I love this movie....... One of my all-time favorites! It's a fun movie for all ages to watch!Swell & Kenny dropped the coffin off at the funeral home, and drove away. While leaving, Swell said to Kenny, ""I should have been nicer to her."" Kenny turned to Swell and said, ""She was a great babysitter."" At the beginning of the movie, Kenny drove off with his friends when Swell was getting out of Nicole's car. Swell had already told her friends when they were shopping that they were going to have the whole summer free from their mom and explained how everyone was going to watch everyone else. She didn't know about the sitter before arriving home. And Kenny had to be reminded by one of his friends that his mom was leaving for a long time...So he yelled, ""By mom! Have a great time in Australia!""Kenny didn't get back until Swell went into the sitter's room to ""talk"" to her and found her dead. Kenny never saw her until Swell went upstairs to have him go down to the sitter's room and help her figure out what to do.Plus, Before Mrs. Crandall (the mother) said to the sitter before she left, ""Mrs. S. You know there are 5 children?""Neither one had even seen one another, so how would Kenny know what kind of sitter she was? l",Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead
