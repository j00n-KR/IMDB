0,TheLittleSongbird,Not quite game over but doesn't have enough for game on,4,3 June 2018,"Watched 'Pixels' a few days ago with not very high expectations. Am not a fan of Adam Sandler, although he has done good performances in the past or the juvenile humour that permeates in too many of his comedies, and the advertising and negative reviews made me further nervous. Absolutely loved the concept though and have a lot of love for Peter Dinklage ('Game of Thrones' is a favourite and he is one of the main reasons).It also garnered a lot of vehement defence so condescending that it put me off watching it for a long time until it came on Film4 and decided to watch it finally. After watching it, 'Pixels' for me was not a particularly good film and didn't do enough with such a great concept, but it could have been so much worse. It is not that bad and is a long way from being one of Sandler's worst (nothing is worse than 'Grown Ups 2' and especially 'Jack and Jill').Starting with the good things, 'Pixels' looks great. Especially in the imaginative production design and truly impressive special effects. There are amusing moments (almost all of it from Dinklage and occasionally from Josh Gad), some decent action and an element of nostalgia.The soundtrack is suitably energetic. Other than the visuals, the best thing about it is Dinklage, for Dinklage it is far from one of his best performances but he does show a knack for comic timing.However, Sandler is on lifeless autopilot throughout and his comic timing is irritating and tired. Gad tries hard but too often over-compensates that he is more annoying than funny and Kevin James is just bizarre in his role. The rest of the cast are wasted and the direction lacks energy and ease.More annoying was that 'Pixels' had such an inventive concept and managed to make it so bland and predictable. There are no surprises here, no originality or imagination, the fun and energy only comes sporadically and tonally the film feels muddled. The references may make older viewers nostalgic but most of them don't serve much purpose and are likely to be lost on younger viewers unfamiliar with what is being referenced. Further killing 'Pixels' is the writing and humour. There are moments that do raise a mild chuckle or smirk but a vast majority of it induces groans and cringing, because the dialogue is so childish and forced and the humour is incredibly juvenile in a way that has been tired and grating long before 'Pixels' was made and came out. It's been present in a lot of Sandler's films especially the ones released in the last decade or so and there is a lot of deja vu here.In summary, not that bad and has its moments but wastes a great concept and is just too juvenile, bland and bizarre to get much from it. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Pixels
1,Leofwine_draca,Good-natured comedy with a retro feel,6,22 January 2018,"You know, I had every reason not to like PIXELS. It's a Hollywood blockbuster comedy with an emphasis on special effects over story, and it's directed by Chris Columbus, a man known for his twee, family-centred productions. It even stars Adam Sandler, who I'm no fan of. Despite all these detractions, I found PIXELS to be a breath of fresh air in a tired world. It's fast and funny, and a treat for anyone who grew up in the 1980s with 1980s-era video games. The film plays out as one big action set-piece with jokes in between, and thank goodness, there's no crudity for once. Sandler himself is okay and Kevin James is a hoot as the bad-mannered president. Peter Dinklage is the real scene-stealer of the group, though, and there are fun cameos from famous names including Dan Ackroyd and Sean Bean. The film's CGI effects are exemplary and just as good as in a massive budget blockbuster like AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, and that city-wide climax is something to behold. Check it out!",Pixels
2,SnoopyStyle,not horrible but should have been brilliant,5,29 February 2016,"Sam Brenner and his chubby loser friend Will Cooper go to the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championships. Ludlow Lamonsoff is a weird nerd with his grandmother. Sam loses to Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant in the final game. A tape of the event is sent into space as a message to aliens. In the present day, Cooper (Kevin James) is the ridiculed President of United States. Brenner (Adam Sandler) is still his best friend but he's in a dead-end job. He falls for Violet (Michelle Monaghan) who turns out to be a Lieutenant Colonel in weapons development. Aliens mistake the tape as a challenge and send light-based weapons in the form of the arcade game characters. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has turned into a conspiracy theorist and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) is in prison. The group has to use their gaming skills to defend the planet in a death match.There is a lot of hate for Adam Sandler. This is not that horrible but he wasted a great opportunity. I love this concept. The movie works great during the battle scenes. It's fun action with loads of 80s recalls. When the action stops, the movie gets really rocky. Sandler continues to have trouble being likable. He keeps playing an annoying douche although he's not as bad as some of his recent outings. He has lost his boyish fun charms of his early movies. His romance with Monaghan has its ups and downs. Kevin James starts out well with a bunch of girl scouts making fun of him. The problem is that he takes his cue from Sandler and overdoes it. Josh Gad needs to dial back the creepiness one level. Being obsessed with a pixel character is creepy although making her Ashley Benson helps a lot. Peter Dinklage is pushing too hard. In general, Chris Columbus has every character pushing too hard. They don't need to and it screws up an otherwise fun comedic action thriller.",Pixels
3,Prismark10,No Gamechanger,3,16 October 2015,"I guess I am in the right age group for Pixels. I played the games featured in this movie in the arcades in my youth. Pixels should had been a lot of nostalgic fun but the Sandler formula is getting old now and I am amazed that there are some 1980s songs still left that have never featured in Sandler's previous films.Adam Sandler plays a whizz-kid arcade games player who in his younger days came second in the world arcade championship, footage of which was sent to space.Now years later an alien planet interpret the footage as an aggressive act and sent sprite like arcade characters to earth to attack it. So you have Pacman on the rampage, Centipede all over London, Donkey Kong is still on the lookout for a plumber.It is up to grown up arcade aces from the old days such as Sandler, his best friend Kevin James, incidentally also the President of the USA, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage to battle these space invaders. Michelle Monaghan plays the love interest. Sean Bean and Brian Cox are the military types who never mastered Commando.Once the film has the big arcade showdown during the climax of the film, its a lot of fun. Q*Bert pops up to give Minion type of support to keep the smaller kids happy.The problem is the film takes too long to get going, the romance angle between Monaghan and Sandler is predictable. The film is actually not funny and there are a lot of problems with it. Why does the Japanese creator of Pacman gets his arm taken off for showing love to his creation but Gad gets to get his Lady Lisa to drop her swords? It looks like they dig dug themselves in a hole.There are a few star cameos which tends to be par to the course in Sandler films but he is a star whose creativity has been on the wane for some time now. It certainly is no can Mr Do.",Pixels
4,claudio_carvalho,Silly Tribute to the Classic Arcade Games from the 80's,4,20 March 2016,"In 1982, the boy Sam Brenner disputes the video game arcade championship and loses the title to Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant playing Donkey Kong. This defeat affects his life and in the present days, Brenner (Adam Sandler) is an installer of audio and video systems. His best friend Will Cooper (Kevin James) is the President of the United States. Brenner is installing a system at the house of Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan), who has just divorced, for her son Matty (Matt Lintz). Out of the blue, he is summoned to the White House and he finds that Violet is a military that works there. Soon he learns that an American base was attacked by aliens. When he meets his friend Ludlow ""The Wonder Kid"" Lamansoff (Josh Gad), he discovers that the aliens have found a time capsule sent by the US Government to the space with a videocassette of video game and understood that it was a declaration of war. The aliens broadcast a challenge to Earth to play and win a video game against them; otherwise Earth will be destroyed. Now the last hope on Earth is Brenner, Cooper, Ludlow, Violet and Eddie (Peter Dinklage).""Pixels"" is a silly tribute to the classic arcade games from the 80's. Despite the great cast and awesome special effects, but the story is too silly. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Pixels""",Pixels
5,nogodnomasters,Everybody wants to rule the world,7,24 March 2018,"This is an Adam Sandler movie so it automatically has lovers and haters with parents wondering if their kids can watch it. The film opens in 1982 with kids playing in an arcade championship with the tape being sent into space by NASA for aliens. Years later when Kevin James is POTUS and Sandler is on the NERD Brigade installing TV systems, the world is attacked by aliens using video games tactics. Only the old time players have the ability to defeat them, sort of like ""Ghost Busters"" but not nearly as funny.For those who like movies based on video games, this one goes over the top. The script is formula with minor twists but not real surprises. The language was iffy as it uses the word ""b***h"" which made the kids giggle. There was 1 F-bomb. There is some talk about sex such as making a Martha Stewart, Serena Williams sandwich. Definite PG-13 stuff.Adam Sandler managed to score minor roles for his wife and kids. There are some fun scenes with era music and people, even though some came after 1982 creating anachronisms.Good mindless fun, aimed at teens who were around in 1982 and wormholed into the present.",Pixels
6,kosmasp,Hitting a new low,2,4 October 2015,"And there you thought playing video games is about getting high scores ... well you thought right, but this misses the goal - badly! You can take what I wrote and spin it of course (like I would do with one guy who wrote he doesn't understand the overall vote this has - yeah me too! Because anything above 5 is ridiculous), but you cannot take anything in the movie and spin it.The best thing in this is Peter Dinklage. And even he has to suffer through a lot of scenes that are just dreadful And not in a good sense either. Unless you're watching this as ""50 Shades of Pac-Man"" I suggest to stay as far away from it as possible. Maybe kids, who don't get the misogynistic and unfunny tone of the movie, might like some of it, but how they were able to turn a more than decent idea into a pile of ... well you know what - I can't really understand or fathom. I almost felt dirty (again not in a good way, just disgusting) after watching this, it's hard to express it with any other words.Predictable, unfunny (throwing insults into peoples faces, being racist or generally discriminating can be funny - if you're able to pull that off - obviously not the case here, unless intoxicated) and just generally bad, making good actors looking weak (Michelle, Peter Dinklage) is quite a feat ... not one I actually enjoy watching though",Pixels
7,BA_Harrison,Arcade mis-fire.,3,2 July 2017,"Let me start by saying that I'm not averse to Adam Sandler—I've enjoyed quite a few of his films—and I admire Chris Columbus if only for writing Gremlins. Pixels, however, is dreadful, and fully deserving of any critical mauling it has received.A promising premise—aliens attack Earth in the form of video games after mistaking a videotape of '80s arcade classics for a declaration of war—is developed as a series of lacklustre action scenes loaded with flashy CGI and not very funny humour.Sandler adopts his usual affable loser persona but can do little with the lousy material; also wasted are the talents of Brian Cox, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean, while the lovely Ashley Benson, as sexy game character Lady Lisa, is there purely as eye candy (not that I'm complaining about that—she was sorely needed to take my mind off the terrible comedy).It's also hard to see who the film would appeal to: adults will find much of the humour childish and grating (the 'cute' digital Q-bert character had me cringing in embarrassment), while the many references to '80s pop culture (Max Headroom, Hall and Oates, most of the games) will be lost on the young.And is it even possible to use a cheat code on an arcade machine? I think not.",Pixels
8,tavm,I enjoyed Pixels for what it was,6,5 August 2015,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend who had watched this before and enjoyed it. I did too, though I knew this wasn't gonna be any greats shakes and it wasn't. There were some funny lines at the beginning and some of the video game gags did go a little well. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan did well with their roles. When I saw the arcade and all those video games during the 1982 sequence, part of me felt some nostalgia for the times I spent with my brother and his friend playing those games at that kind of place. About the ending sequence taking place one year later: lame. Though really, this was pretty enjoyable so on that note, Pixels is worth a look.",Pixels
9,michaelRokeefe,Better than expected; but not a overwhelming winner.,3,7 August 2015,"Wasn't actually my pick for an afternoon movie. I didn't expect much and wasn't totally surprised to be one of the two people in the theater. Not being an arcade gamer didn't leave much lost in translation. The 1982 Arcade Games Championship was filmed and for some reason later became part of a payload shot into space. Decades later the video clips are intercepted and misunderstood to be a declaration of war. The same competing gamer geeks and nerds of long ago are called on to protect the earth from invading aliens conducting war in the form of ancient arcade games.Special effects are more interesting than most of the stars directed by Chris Columbus: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Peter Dinklage, Brian Cox and Dan Aykroyd. I do admit being impressed by Michelle Monaghan and Ashley Benson.",Pixels

11,preppy-3,"Stupid, sexist and basically unfunny but the graphics are GREAT",5,29 July 2015,"NASA, in 1982, sends a bunch of video games into outer space. Years later aliens discover it and see it as a declaration of war (???). They send outsize versions of the video games to Earth to attack. It's up to the president (Kevin James) to get help. He hires his old friend (Adam Sandler) who used to be a whiz a video games to help battle the aliens. Along with some fellow gamers (Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage) they do battle. There's also the obligatory love interest (Michelle Monaghan).Like all Sandler films this is full of sexist smutty humor--not one bit of it was funny. I think I chuckled once or twice but that was it. Also Sandler gives a terrible lifeless performance. The plot is full of HUGE loopholes that make little sense. And Josh Gad is fat, loud, ugly and as annoying as hell. Still there are good things here. It does move quickly; guest stars Sean Bean, Serena Williams and Jane Krakowski are amusing; James and Monaghan are great in their roles and there are some great 80s songs on the soundtrack. But the main reason to see the film is the video games graphics. They look GREAT and the battle scenes are lots of fun. Best of all is an all out attack at the end by the aliens where virtually every 80s video game character makes an appearance. It's worth seeing just once for that alone. Otherwise it's pretty stupid and pointless.",Pixels
12,zardoz-13,The Aliens Should Have Won!!!,5,27 July 2015,"Combine ""Independence Day"" with ""Ghostbusters"" and then insert Adam Sandler in another of his immature man-child roles as the hero, and you've got the premise of ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" director Chris Columbus' predictable, but palatable ""Pixels,"" a nostalgic sci-fi fantasy about the bygone video game arcade era. Initially, you might think Columbus and ""Mr. Deeds"" writer Tim Herlihy and ""Just Go with It"" scribe Timothy Dowling have done little more than synthesize elements of ""Independence Day"" and ""Ghostbusters"" for the ""Saturday Night Live"" alumnus. Actually, the filmmakers have adapted French director Patrick Jean's ephemeral, two-minute short ""Pixels"" (2010) about space invaders masquerading as vintage video game characters. Sadly, everything about Columbus' ""Pixels"" adaptation is wholesome and lukewarm rather than imaginative and mischievous. Since he slipped into middle-age, the 48-year old Sandler hasn't made anything as audacious as his early, lowest-common-denominator farces: ""Billy Madison"" (1995), ""Happy Gilmore"" (1996), ""The Waterboy"" (1998), ""Big Daddy"" (1999), and ""Little Nicky"" (2000). Later, Sandler appeared in comedies with a slightly higher IQ such as his critically acclaimed ""Punch Drunk Love"" (2002), ""Anger Management"" (2003) with Jack Nicholson, ""50 First Dates"" (2004) with Drew Barrymore, ""Click"" (2006) with Christopher Walken, and ""I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry"" (2007) with Kevin James. Just as he explored new facets with his image in ""Punch Drunk Love,"" Sandler ventured even further afield with Judd Apatow's heavyweight ""Funny People"" (2009) as a comedian stricken with cancer.Sandler's recent big screen efforts have overshadowed neither ""Punch Drunk Love"" nor ""Funny Business."" Indeed, ""Pixels"" is just as routine as ""Just Go for It"" (2011), ""Grown-Ups"" (2010), its sequel ""Grown-Ups 2"" as well as ""Jack and Jill"" (2011) and ""That's My Boy"" (2012). Although nothing about ""Pixels"" is likely to affront or alienate anybody like ""Jack and Jill"" or ""That's My Boy,"" Sandler's shenanigans as a video gamer wronged in his youth comes off as severely superficial. Nevertheless, Columbus has fashioned a coherent but humorless escapade with some amusing characters that are eclipsed by impressive CGI renderings of several 8-bit video characters, including ""PAC-MAN,"" ""Donkey Kong,"" ""Galaga,"" ""Centipede,"" and ""Space Invaders."" Children of the 1980s who grew up in places around the Friendly City, like Two-Bits behind the old McDonalds on Highway 45 North, The Back Porch in the old McRae's Mall, and Diamond Jim's in the Leigh Mall may cherish fond memories of those days. ""Pixels"" unfolds in 1982 as 13-year old Sam Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) and his best friend Will Cooper (Jared Riley) leap astride their banana-seat bikes and ride off to the first video game arcade to open in their town. Not only does Sam discover he has a knack for defeating Pac-Man and Centipede, but Cooper and he make friends with forlorn 8-year-old Ludlow Lamonsoff (Jacob Shinder) whose only friend is his grandmother. Eventually, Sam takes his gift for winning video games to a Donkey Kong Championship. Unfortunately, he lands in second place behind his chief adversary, snotty, self-centered, 13-year-old Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), who christens himself 'The Fire Blaster.' Interestingly enough, NASA loads up footage of their video game competition in a time capsule and launches it into deep space. Optimistically, NASA hopes to establish peaceful contact with an alien civilization. Meantime, after Eddie trounced him, Sam has turned into a perennial slacker. Basically, Sam lives a low-profile life. Although he got married, his wife cheated on him with their pediatrician. Now, he installs home entertainment systems for a living. Actually, Sandler looks clownish in his bright orange Nerds company outfit that resembles a UPS drivers' uniform. Meantime, Sam's obese buddy Will has plunged into politics and now serves as President. Nevertheless, Will has an appalling habit of putting his foot in his mouth whenever he ventures out into the public eye. Recently, during a reading initiative at a kindergarten, Cooper reprimanded a little girl for correcting his pronunciation. Their friend Ludlow (Josh Gad of ""The Wedding Ringer"") has turned into a conspiracy theorist.Without warning, a mysterious interplanetary force destroys a U.S. military base in Guam. Not only does it convert the base into hundreds of cubes, but it also abducts a security guard. President Cooper assembles his advisers and summons Sam. One of the President's advisers is Lieutenant Colonel Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan of ""Source Code"") who has just separated from her philandering husband. Violet's hubby cheated on her with his 19-year old Pilates instructor. Before they race each other to the White House, Sam and Violet meet at her house after he arrived to install a home entertainment system. Violet and Sam sit in her closet and swap sentimental stories so Violet's teenage son Matty (Matt Lintz of ""The Crazies"") won't see her grieve. Anyway, an enigmatic alien race has acquired the NASA footage, but they have misconstrued it as an invitation to war. Miraculously, Sam's superb video skills make him a highly sought-after individual, and President Cooper assigns Sam and Ludlow to teach Navy SEALS for combat against the aliens. Lieutenant Colonel Van Patten has analyzed the cube debris from Guam, and she has created light-blasting ray guns that smash the aliens to smithereens. President Cooper refuses to act quickly enough to prevent another attack and the aliens destroy the Taj Mahal. Naturally, our heroes whip the aliens with relative nonchalance in one confrontation after another in this PG-13 rated hokum. The showdowns with Pac-Man and Donkey Kong yield the most suspense, and the special effects look fabulous. The funniest scene occurs when the fictional father of Pac-Man, Professor Iwatani (Denis Akiyama of ""Johnny Mnemonic""), tries to reason with a gargantuan replica of his computer-generated son and it munches his forearm. Columbus appropriated this scene from Howard Hawks' 1951 chiller ""The Thing from Another World."" Not even villainous Peter Dinklage as the diminutive adult version of Eddie can generate any spontaneity in this attractive but anemic laffer. Altogether, ""Pixels"" qualifies as one of Sandler's least memorable movies.",Pixels

14,view_and_review,Grading on a Curve,6,21 December 2015,"Adam Sandler's movies dropped off of a cliff close to ten years ago. I mean, the very plots haven't even been interesting enough to get me to watch. I gave a go at ""Grown Ups"" only to be disappointed (as such I didn't bother with ""Grown Ups 2""). I gave ""Pixels"" a try for two reasons: 1.) I loved those 8 bit games the movie is based on and 2.) The trailers looked good.If we were to grade this movie on a curve (i.e. compare it to the Sandler movies of the last 10 years) then this would be at least a B+. If we were to grade it on its own merit, then I'm thinking more like a C. Acting was OK (he's long stop being funny), story was a bit flat and CGI/special effects were about what I expected. Nothing ground-breaking and nothing embarrassingly bad. If Sandler could just improve upon this movie; just build upon the successes of this movie and add more non-stale jokes, more range of actors than himself and his friends and something new then he may be able to recapture the success of old.",Pixels

They invade Earth and attack with giant versions of classic video game characters. A small group of people who once played those games as kids are earth's only hope.If you remember Ghostbusters, Pixels will seem very familiar – the same gang of weirdos are up against the enemy, only instead of ghosts we have computer game characters, with Donkey Kong taking centre stage during the final act rather than the Marshmallow Man. The blocky retro video game graphics are nicely realised, even though Wreck-it Ralph did the gag first two years ago.The plot is full of stuff which stretches credibility: Kevin James, playing the familiar Kevin James character, is President of the USA – oh, really? Josh Gad's Ludlow is halfway between ludicrously gay and ludicrously hetero, with the contradiction never explained, and the way Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan are brought together is typical movie artifice.But Pixels is silly movie to start off with, so this doesn't really really matter. Sandler thankfully offers his affable cleverdick character rather than one of his odious ""funny voice"" characters, and his bickering with Monaghan is played nicely.

17,anaconda-40658,Game Over.,3,8 August 2015,"Pixels (2015): Dir: Chris Columbia / Cast: Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage: Nostalgia flushed down the toilet with this passionless reflection on classic video games. Apparently Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, etc are taking over earth and the military is automatically deemed useless. Only a group of childhood friends now adults can stop this mess because they apparently know the methods of the game. Chris Columbus has been a director of entertaining films whether it be within the Harry Potter films or his work with Robin Williams. Here the game is over before it starts for Columbus. Kevin James as the United States President is a comedic accident all its own. He apparently cannot read and becomes the public laughing stalk. There can be a grain of truth to this when it comes to reading scripts this bad. Adam Sandler leads the group as a sort of repairman because he was great at the arcades as a youngster. Michelle Monaghan plays a mother who is working for the president. Her first impressions of Sandler involves her spilling her guts about her cheating husband. This becomes predictable opposites attract situation that grows stale quickly. Josh Gad plays the grown version of the classic nerd kid. The one sound performance comes from Peter Dinklage as Sandler's childhood competition turned criminal as an adult. He finds redemption but unfortunately that doesn't save the horrid special effects. There was so much potential given the premise but the screenplay is lazy with actors whose game is getting closer to ending when they are unable to counter the bad arcade visions.

18,FlashCallahan,Don't tell anybody I killed a smurf.......,7,8 August 2015,"When aliens mistake images of 1980s arcade games as a sign of aggression, they attack Earth with evil versions of Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and other video-game characters. In response, the U.S. president asks his old gamer pals to battle the invaders.....I'm one of those rare people who actually like the work of Adam Sandler. Sure, he's made a few Mis-steps in the past couple of years, but despite the fact that he has garnered an unbelievable amount of haters, his films always have at least one bonkers moment.So it's no surprise that this movie would fail, because people would be embarrassed to like the movie, because all the hipsters hate them a bit Adam.Well I most not be hip, because this film gave me what I expected, a fun ninety or so minutes, some funny random moments, Kevin James playing the same role he always does, and Dinkledge stealing the film from everyone.Sandler knows what he's doing, he plays the everyday guy who always gets the girl and always saves the day. It's the predictability of his movies and the movies that Happy Madison produce. He's been doing it for twenty years, so why should he do it any different.The film is basically Ghostbusters, but with video game characters we all know and love as the bad guys. That's the film. We travel to Britain where the depiction of the British is I scenes, but so over the top it's hilarious (I'm British, and it's your stereotypical Hollywood depiction that's been done since the seventies).And then it's back and forth fighting the titular villains until the big finale. Apart from the PAC-MAN sequence, there is nothing new here, the jokes are almost a linear part of a Sandler vehicle, slightly sexist, very moronic, but, they still never fail to make me smile.All in all if you are a fan of Sandler, see it, its nowhere near as bad as what the critics and haters are saying, but then again, in some circles, it's not cool to like films that people disregard before even seeing.I'm glad I'm not in those circles, because I'd miss some brainless fun to make me forget about the stresses of the real world.Man up, and admit you liked it really.",Pixels

Classic arcade game icons attacking the Earth has enough silly charm in the premise and some of the jokes are worth a chuckle (despite the very ""Wedding Singer"" cut-n-paste jokes that constitute '80s nostalgic humor). But in the end, this is an Adam Sandler vehicle, and all of this is tailored to his indifferent personality. I have no problem with him; he can be a great actor. When he wants to be. But does anyone really buy him here as an uber-nerd? ""Pixels"" has the big Summer budget and colorful visuals to match, but it's all wasted on lazy execution.5/10",Pixels
20,namashi_1,Made Me Nostalgic!,6,27 September 2015,"Based on French director Patrick Jean's 2010 short film of the same name, 'Pixels' is an exciting idea, that also made me nostalgic. It takes the cult arcade games of our time & puts them in a story, that is often entertaining, despite some flaws. 'Pixels' Synopsis: When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.'Pixels' has some moments, that work on its advantage. The concept firstly is fun & watching the legendary characters of the arcade games come to life, give us fan boys, pure guilty pleasure. However, the goings-on aren't always engaging & the pace drops in the middle too. But, 'Pixels' needs to be watched with limited expectations, in order, to enjoy it!Tim Herlihy & Timothy Dowling's Adapted Screenplay is mostly fun, but it could've been tighter. The second-hour, especially, lacks meat. Chris Columbus's Direction is passable. Graphics are pretty good. Cinematography & Editing are okay. Art Design is accurate. Performance-Wise: Adam Sandler is as usual. Kevin James is superb as the goofy president. Michelle Monaghan is adequate. Josh Gad & The Terrific Peter Dinklage are funny. Brian Cox is wasted. Ditto for Sean Bean. On the whole, 'Pixels' isn't an all-out entertainer, but yet its fun, especially for those, who've grown up on these games!",Pixels
21,StevePulaski,Caters to its respective season and nostalgia quite effectively,7,26 July 2015,"The immense hate for ""Pixels"" has me asking a serious question for those who hate the film, did you hate the concept or did you simply find yourself refusing any inkling of positivity or humor whilst watching the film upon seeing Adam Sandler as the top-billed actor? I ask this question as somebody who finds myself at odds with Sandler on most of his projects, but also somebody willing to admit his achievements and provide him with credit when he deserves it.I ask this because it seems the good majority of the public, and critics for that matter, have given up on Adam Sandler, ostensibly just waiting to hate the next project he's working on before it's even released. The negative buzz around ""Pixels,"" similar to ""Blended,"" Sandler's last feature, started early and never let up. While Sandler has given himself plenty of reasons (and films, for that matter) to dislike him and his work, I feel under the work of any other actor besides Sandler and his production company, ""Pixels"" would've at least garnered a handful of defenders.""Pixels"" is a brazenly silly sound and lights show, one that works predominately because of its willingness to exhaust its premise and use many actors with differing personalities to carry the entire show. That, right there, is about all I can say for the film: it's cheeky, it's relentlessly goofy, but it's also just funny enough and adventurous enough to recommend to anyone searching for that piece of entertainment in the cool multiplexes during this hot summer.The film opens with Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, two best friends who spend their days at the arcade, where Sam discovers his incredible skill for video games. Will encourages him to compete in the first video game championship of 1982, which will be recorded and sent into space by NASA, along with other artifacts. At the tournament, however, Sam winds up losing to Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), a cocky, professional video gamer.Decades later, Sam (Adam Sandler) works as an installer of software and his pal Will (Kevin James) goes on to be The President of the United States, still both very close friends despite their difference in power. One day, Will calls Sam into the office to observe an attack on a military base in Guam by what looks to be the video game pixels and characters from the arcade game Galaga. Baffled by the insanity of this possibility, Sam reconnects with Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), a pudgy conspiracy theorist whom he met at at the video game tournament back in the 1980's. Ludlow shows Sam a video claiming to be sent from aliens that the video tape of the tournament was seen as a declaration of war, prompting the aliens to send the video game characters from classic arcade games to attack the world. The world gets ""three lives,"" so to speak, which are lost if one particular battle (video game) is lost. Three lost battles and the Earth is terminated.Desperate and out of options, Will orders Sam, Ludlow, Eddie, and his unique weapons specialist Lieutenant Colonel Violent van Patten (Michell Monaghan) to fight the pixelated monsters, which come in the form of Centipede, Pac-Man, and eventually Donkey Kong.It shouldn't take more than a minute of watching the trailer for ""Pixels"" to decide if you'd want to see something like this. Those who do, if they view the film as the basic summer entertainment that the film is trying to be, will find a perfectly acceptable and balanced dose of fun. ""Pixels"" also works as a showcase for a divisive array of talent. We have Sandler, who is surprisingly very relaxed and nonchalant throughout the whole film, James, who is toned down several notches from his usual self as well, Gad, who bears the same kind of energy Sandler did in his heyday, only with much more personality, and Dinklage, who's narcissism and brazen attitude effectively make his character.Finally, ""Pixels"" works because it doesn't take itself too seriously; it knows exactly what it needs to do to succeed and that is to be a nonstop display of action with a great visual scheme and characters that are at least somewhat fun to be around. This may not be a showstopper of a film, but it's something that definitely caters to a season of films where numerous other, lesser films find themselves being defended while ""Pixels"" sits and suffers in a ""guilt by association"" manner.",Pixels

23,Hellmant,A fun 80s throwback!,7,6 August 2015,"'PIXELS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Adam Sandler's big budget sci-fi comedy bomb; about an alien invasion, in the form of classic 80s 8-bit video game characters. Sandler stars in the movie, with his buddy Kevin James; along with Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, Michelle Monaghan, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Jane Krakowski. It was directed by Chris Columbus (who's famous for directing such popular hits as 'ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING', 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE', the first two 'HOME ALONE' films and the first two 'HARRY POTTER' movies) and it was written by Tim Herlihy (Sandler's buddy, who also co- wrote 'BILLY MADISON', 'HAPPY GILMORE', 'THE WEDDING SINGER', 'THE WATERBOY' and other hit Sandler flicks) and Timothy Dowling (who also co-wrote the Sandler film 'JUST GO WITH IT'). It was based on the 2010 2- minute French animated short, of the same name, by Patrick Jean. It's not nearly as bad as the reviews make it out to be, or the film's Box Office; it's actually pretty entertaining (for an Adam Sandler movie, at least). The movie takes place sometime in the near future, when aliens have misinterpreted a video feed, from earth, featuring classic 80s 8-bit video games, as a declaration of war. So they attack our planet, in the form of characters from those games. Sandler, James, Dinklage and Gad all play former child video game whizzes, from the 80s, who now need to use their skills to combat the alien invasion. They're given three specific game challenges, in which, upon defeat, they'll lose a life (and someone is abducted). When they lose all three lives, earth will be destroyed. James's character is also the President of the United States (for some bizarre reason). The movie is a fun 80s throwback; if you grew up with these arcade games, you should get a kick out of it. The effects are just OK, and it's not especially funny, but it is entertaining; it's a fun summer popcorn flick, at least. It's much better than Sandler's usual slapstick garbage, especially the stuff he's been putting out lately, and it's nice to see him branching out, and trying different things. This is at least somewhat different; he's never done an action movie before. It's also a good kids' film, and it's not too dumbed-down; especially for an Adam Sandler movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb0-wDtevNo",Pixels

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Hits some right notes, but mostly a bit of a let down",4,24 February 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning As a young boy in the early '80s, Brenner (Adam Sandler) was a whizz-kid at arcade games, at a time when they had just come out and were all the rage. However, after a humiliating defeat to local rival Eddie (Peter Dinklage), he can't see his life going anywhere...and it doesn't, whilst years later his best friend Cooper (Kevin James) has gone and become the president. But Brenner's life might be about to change, after aliens in outer space misinterpret a signal sent from Earth as a declaration of war, and send an army in the shape of the arcade games he was once so good at playing to attack Earth. Brenner now must go from zero to hero, and save the world as only he can.Some films are harder to read than others. Sometimes, it can be difficult to work out whether something was meant to be taken seriously, as a piece of high art, or will end up leaving you to marvel at whether it was just a massive in-joke when you see the abysmal quality of the finished product. In a nutshell, some films were made to win Oscars, and some, while not being meant as bad, were simply made to switch your brain off and have some cheesy, shameless fun. It's safe to say a film about arcade game characters from the '80s being sent from space to attack Earth would fall slap bang in to the aforementioned category, and so anyone who approached Pixels with any sense of Citizen Kane expectations, and slammed it simply for what it is, would only have themselves to blame for not recognising the potential sort of entertainment factor it had. But somehow, it doesn't work even on this level.The revival of '80s nostalgia seems to be pretty high right now, and a lot of popular culture seems to be selling its premise simply on a concept that promotes that. So a film where a host of these former game icons, most notably a giant Pac Man, are among the main characters is a cat in the bag all of its own. Indeed, the film itself has a zany sort of Ghost Busters esque appeal about it, and the hope was that it could match the zany fun of those films. All the right ingredients are there, and it does manage some funny, enjoyable moments. But consistently, despite the affection for its source material, it fails to really be any fun and keep the tone going.Director Chris Colombus litters the most high profile thing he's done in years with a host of big name stars, including Brit actors Brian Cox and Sean Bean in comedic hard man military roles, whilst big name comedy star Sandler vies for comic affection from other established star James. Somehow, none of them can inject this missed opportunity with the spark it needs. **",Pixels

28,lesleyharris30,"Fun Movie that will leave Kids and Adults Entertained,",7,19 September 2015,"Pixels is a good movie with a well written storyline and a terrific comedic cast. It's a very fun movie that does something that most films aimed at families fail to do, it's funny for both kids and adults, I watched this in the theatre and I couldn't help noticing that there was just as much laughter from the older audience as there was children, it has a ton of classic 80's video game characters, such as Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Q*bert, and it's a delight for all ages to see all these classic characters in one movie whether you're familiar with them or not. It certainly has its flaws, my biggest issue is that the trailer spoiled too much of the movie, it shows every single battle (that being three) as well as basically every video game character that appears in this, it should have had much more, it was clearly given creative freedom by Sony to use as many as they could and I don't think they took advantage of that as much as they should have, there should have been more characters other than Q*bert to be used for cute comic relief, and I think there should have been a few more battles between the humans and the classic games as well. This film is receiving way too much criticism that I don't think it deserves, it isn't perfect and it dosen't make as much use of its creative and original plot as it could have, but the reviews for this are brutal and I don't understand why, I think critics just assume that an Adam Sandler film is always going to be terrible, and when that's your attitude and you're going in to all his films with extremely low expectations, then of course you won't like it, critics don't seem to look at Pixels for the fun and harmless adventure it is, and I actually found Sandler to be quite charming in it, the kind of comedic performance I like from him, subtle and realistic, and because of these reviews Pixels became the most underrated movie of the summer. Though it certainly has its imperfections, Piixels is a very fun movie that had me entertained and sucked in to this world of pure imagination from start to finish, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film that children and adults will enjoy. A group of hardcore gamers must battle aliens who have come to attack Earth in the form of classic 80's video game characters. Best Performance: Josh Gad Worst Performance: Brian Cox",Pixels

For prosperity purposes the video tape of the contest is shot into space. 33 years later he is working as an electronics installer when he gets a call from his childhood friend, President Cooper (James) telling him that the Earth is under attack...by video games. Now it is up to Sam along with other gamers from 1982 to save the world. This is a movie I was not sure what to expect. To me, Sandler is either very funny (Happy Gilmore) or unwatchable (Jack & Jill), and I thought this one could go either way. I was actually leaning toward the latter but I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised and I laughed a lot throughout. The movie is really nothing amazing but what it is is very entertaining and a decent family movie.

34,ironhorse_iv,"Call me a Nintendo cartridge, because this movie can blow me. I didn't like the film.",5,1 August 2015,"In the film, NASA launches a time capsule into outer space in the hope of making peaceful First Contact with alien life in 1982. Included in the capsule is a representative cross-section of Earthly delights from the era, including a number of classic arcade games. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret the arcade games as a declaration of war, and decide to attack earth, using various video game characters as weapons. While, its sounds like a cool concept, sadly, this movie is not worth your quarters. This brainless video game movie killed me. Good thing, I have two more lives, left. Don't get me wrong, the movie directed by Chris Columbus, had some entertaining moments, but unfortunately, the negatives about the film, outlive the positives. Based on the 2010 short film of the same name by Patrick Jean. Pixels has an story that sounds suspiciously like a rip-off of a sequence from Futurama's 2002's Season 4, Episode 3 ""Anthology of Interest II"" in which the Earth was invade by aliens, cloak as old school classic video game characters. I wonder if the writers of Futurama, ever sued them for plagiarism claims. Anyways, the visual effects are by far, the best thing in the film, but part of the reason the movie is off-putting to some video games fans, is because the movie barely did any research on the games, in which the character came from. A good example of this, was Pac-Man & Donkey Kong. Not only did, they screw up the gameplay, by not having a kill screen. They also establish a major plot point that wasn't in the original games, which is cheat codes. It's made worse by the fact that the film never explains, how these cheat codes were able to be use, during the real live battles. Plus, I really doubt, four color-coded Mini Coopers offered as ghost analogues could defeat a giant Pac-Man. Technically; they still wasn't ghosts, but I was willing to suspension my disbelief to try to enjoy the film. One thing, that really bug me, was Q*bert. Why in the earth, did the writers allow Q*bert to talk? Wouldn't he, be cursing, if he did? Geesit's like they didn't do any research!? They made it, worst, by turning Q*bert into a female love interest, during the film. I didn't think, that the movie would go so low, to make a 1980s retro-gamer's wet dream, into reality. That's pretty mess up. With that say, some of the 1980s references, don't make any sense, within its timeline. If the time capsule was sent in 1982, how were the aliens, able to make video games characters from later games, like 1985's Tetris or 1984's Duck Hunt or gain access to later video clips of 1980's celebrities. While, this might seem like nitpicking, the movie is so full of anachronisms like these! It's too jarring, not to ignored. Honestly, the movie would had, been more enjoyable, if the acting was a little better. The presence of Adam Sandler as the lead, former arcade champion Sam Brenner was not good. He looks tired and out of it. Sandler in particular comes off downright bored, even during the film's action scenes. He didn't have any heart. His character was very generic for Sandler. Per usual, Sandler plays an immature man/boy who treat women like crap. He was very unlikable. Kevin James as US President William Cooper was a little better. While, he's totally unbelievable as the president, it's nice to see him, not in annoying role. Sadly, that role was given to Josh Gad as Ludlow Lamonsoff, an anti-social conspiracy theorist nut. Every time, he was on screen, his character kill any enjoyment. His character, has garnered so much hate, due to his constant screaming. His creepy sexual tendencies toward everybody, just make it even worse. Peter Dinklage's character, Eddie Plant is usually considered the highlight of the movie, thanks to his actor putting effort into his performance. I love how Peter Dinklage's character looks very similar to Donkey Kong high score record holder Billy Mitchell from 2007's The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters, documentary. I wonder if Billy Mitchell, ever sued them for his likeness. Anyways, I really hate the film, for the nerd stereotypes. It's very insulting, for a film to make fun of their target audience. If you're a female. You probably hate this movie, more for their tiresome female stereotypes. Characters like Col. Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) & First Lady Jane Cooper (Jane Krakowski) are high ranking, successful women, but they're often portray as a train-wreck, codependent, women whom only purpose in the film, to fall in love with the male main characters. Violet, alone, often get degraded by names by Sam, to the point, that I really didn't see, much chemistry between them. Even Ludlow's childhood crush, the kick-ass, but silent, Lady Lisa (played by Ashley Benson), is just there to be, literal ""trophy"" wife. It's really sucks to be female in this movie. The film is full of a lot of unsubtly unfunny raunchy sex jokes that wasn't well-receive. The movie has some toilet humor, but thank goodness, nothing too gross. Still, the family-Unfriendly Death scenes, mild swearing and various other inappropriate stuff, didn't stop, this film getting a PG-13 rated. The movie got a lot of publicity with child, but I doubt they will get any of the 1980's references. I did like all the 1980's pop culture references, including the wicked 1980's style, soundtrack that played, throughout the film. Another thing that I love, is the celebrity cameos. It's cool to see them, here. The ending is pretty predictable. I'm surprised, they didn't go with the dark gritty ending of the short film. That would have been interesting. Anyways, the post-credits scene is disturbing, enough. Overall: I'm sorry, but I'll not insert any more coins to rewatch this lazy, creatively-bankrupt movie. That's it! It's Game Over, man! Game Over! Watch Disney 2012's Wreck it Ralph, instead!",Pixels
35,The-Sarkologist,Adam Sandler still has it,9,12 September 2015,"Okay, a movie paying tribute to 80s video games was always going to attract my attention, but to be honest with you I never expected the film to be anywhere near as good, or even as silly, as this one. Actually, when it comes to silliness I probably shouldn't have been at all surprised, especially since we have a movie where the characters from these old video games attack Earth, and any movie in which the major characters are chasing Pacman around New York City in coloured mini coopers is definitely not going to be on the serious list.However, when it comes to silly movies there are those that are just plain silly and you spend the entire movie shaking your head wandering what possessed even the conservative powers that be in Hollywood to come up with such a concept, and then you get classic Adam Sandler. In fact, ever since The Waterboy I simply no longer expected Sandler to come anywhere near the level of the films that launched him to stardom – yet here we have Pixels and here we have Sandler back to his hilarious best.Yep, that's right – not only is the film about how characters from 1980s video games invade the Earth, but it is actually really, really funny as well. Okay, at the beginning where we are introduced to a young Sam Brenner who knows how to beat video games by reading the patterns but losing to a dwarf at the world championships and thus being only the second-best video gamer in the world, it seems that it is simply going to be your standard silly movie. However jump to the present where it turns out that Sam Brenner's best friend has become the President of the United States, and they still catch up for a regular chat, you suddenly realise that it is going to be one of those movies and you know that you aren't supposed to take it seriously.This film brought back an awful lot of memories, but then again I suspect that this was the film's main purpose: to remind us children of the 80s of all the fun that we used to have down at the video arcades playing classic games such as Space Invaders, Frogger, and Centipede. Sure, you can still play those games over the internet, but as Sam suggested, games these days simply aren't the same. They don't run on patterns but rather on the principle of trying to stay alive as long as possible (and if that doesn't work then pressing the reset key). In fact they brought back lots of the characters that we remember from the golden days of computer gaming, including Donkey Kong (which was one of the original platform games).I guess I can also relate to Sam somewhat, being a kid who spent as much time as possible trying to beat computer games and then landing up in an ordinary job simply because computer game skills are simply not transferable. Sure, Sam is a computer geek, but his best friend became the President of the United States while he is installing hardware in people's houses. He even displays the geeky tendencies of simply not being able to relate to women in the way that most people are able to relate to them (though a part of that has to do with the silliness of the entire film). Of course, it does run along the standard Hollywood storyline where the protagonist, whom society has passed by, becomes the saviour of the world (and gets the girl in the end).While I don't want to spoil the film, I have to say that I loved the end credits. Once again it brings back memories of the days when computer graphics were incredibly basic – not the almost life like incarnations of games that you get these days. While it is promoted as a kids movie (particularly with the trailers for the films at the beginning), in many ways this is a film for those of us who spent way to much time pumping quarters into games at the local video arcade, or stuck in front of our Commodore 64s relentlessly trying to get that frog across the road.",Pixels
36,Reno-Rangan,I enjoyed it because it reminded me my childhood.,7,4 November 2015,"There are plenty of movies related to the video games. The 80s movie 'Tron' was one of those first I have seen, followed by many. But the recent one 'Wreck-it Ralph' was the game changer in the modern animation/CGI which led to another similar flick, 'The Lego Movie'. Lego and 'Toy Story' are the toys, not the video games, but very close to this theme and I'm very happy that Hollywood made this film for the guys like me who grew up playing them.The film had a very simple story with the great visuals. Sometimes simple is very good rather going for hi-tech. Especially those who played these games in their middle-age back in the 80s could be now very old and they might suffer to understand the film due to the technology/terms/phrase gap, if it matched to the todays hi-tech hi-resolution video games. But the youngsters of the present era didn't understand that who are the backbone of any movie's success and that's why this movie sunk in the ocean of criticism.My childhood and teenage was the late 90s and early 00s respectively, So 8bit games are on the edge of revolution. My favourites were the races and brick games, especially 'Duck Hunt', because I get a gun, not joystick. So this movie really brought me those sweet memories. A decade ago I used those unique sounds and music for message alerts in my 2G mobile phone(s).I know recently Sandler had hit the rock bottom in his acting career, but, he's kind of lifted after the decent film 'The Cobbler' and excellent multistarrer 'Men, Women & Children'. This is not a massive comeback to what he's known for, comedies. But, sailing on average or above in better than falling downward in the career graph. To me this film was a better one, an above average, obviously not a masterpiece.Guest appearances were unexpected, but was not that effective, except Ashley Benson, who was so hot in her 2-3 odd minutes. This film is not for everyone. Youngsters and oldsters never understand it. If you were born in the 70s and 80s, then probably you will know what to expect. Even it does not deliver to your expectation, definitely gives satisfaction for bringing those lost memories of our childhood.7/10",Pixels
37,Floated2,Mild Entertainment,4,13 July 2017,"Pixels is a plot story of nerds and nostalgia in 3D. A rather lightweight Adam Sandler family movie that's not as ghastly and retrograde. The film begins in 1982 when 12-year-old best friends Sam and Will have their first encounter with arcade games. Just as in many preview Sandler films, it starts with a flashback as him and his friends as kids, then eventually shows the present day.Pixels isn't as funny or entertaining as I had assumed. Though from reviews and critics it is clear what this film really was about. Much about the film makes little sense and the humor isn't at all clever or anything new. Sandler plays his typical character, while Kevin James is the president (very odd choice). There are some decent scenes of entertaining involving the visuals but in the end the film doesn't grasp or make an impact that it could have. Such as the character of the little orange creature 'Q-Bert' steals its scenes. The Pac-Man coming to life scene involving them as 'ghosts cars' was quite well done too.

38,eddie_baggins,Game over man....game over,2,25 April 2016,"Spoken about regularly as one of 2015's worst films, Pixels is a dire comedy made by and starring a bunch of people that should know better and a film that thinks some good old fashioned gaming nostalgia will be enough to win us over despite the fact this 'comedy' is scarily bereft of laughs, charm and features a cast that looks like they would rather be somewhere else, spending the money they earnt here on a not well earned break.I can't recall from recent memory a film that feels so tired, so bored with itself, almost resigned to the fact that it's not fun and it doesn't help at all that in a recent career full of bad roles and lethargic performances, Pixels features Adam Sandler at his very worst.The Oxford dictionary better update their recent editions as tired and uninterested needs to place a picture of Sandler under those definitions.Sandler's avid old school arcade gamer Sam Brenner is truly one of the worst leading characters of modern film. Possessing neither a comedic timing, an ounce of actual effort or any genuine hint of life, Sandler is but a zombie walking through this ugly looking cavalcade of ideas and uninteresting action scenes, scenes that are reminisce of someone playing a fun game but never sharing the controller as you sit back and watch. Sandler's career has once and for all slumped to a new low personnel low and the same can be said of director Chris Columbus.The man responsible for the first two Harry Potter films, Mrs. Doubtfire and Home Alone and also the writer of Gremlins and The Goonies, it's clear Columbus knows a thing or two about entertaining people through the medium of film but Pixels seems devoid of entertainment and Columbus must be blamed for so blandly directing this wannabe franchise starter. Wasting not only the chance to merge gaming lore with big screen thrills but support from the likes of an unbelievably bad Peter Dinklage (Tyrion would be sorely disappointed) and the sad supporting turns from actors like Sean Bean and Brian Cox.Any movie that casts Kevin James as the American President was going to have a hard time succeeding but really there is no excuse for Pixels to be so downright boring and lacking in joy. Getting a star purely around the fact it has some nice ideas that never eventuate into their potential, Pixels is such a sad state of affairs that many of its cast members will be wishing they had another life to spend on not signing up for this disaster in the first place.

This movie had a really good concept, in terms of using the old video games, which I personally grew up with, but the rest of the plot is far fetched and quite silly. Having Kevin James as the president was a bad choice but there was a couple of funny moments, especially with the little orange character, Q'Bert. Anyway, the movie starts of with a young Brenner (Adam Sandler), Cooper (Kevin James) and Ludlow (Josh Gad), playing video games in a amusement park. Brenner then enters the 1982 Worldwide Video Arcade Championships which also has the Guinness Book of Records attending, along with Nasa who will be recording the nights events so they can send a probe into the solar system, hoping that it can connect to extraterrestrial life. REALLY! Anyway, Brenner has to beat Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" (Peter Dinklage) to become champion but he fails to beat him at Donkey Kong so he has to make do with second place. The movie then switches to the present day, we're Brenner is a mobile electrician and Cooper is the president of the United States. When an army unit gets attacked by a mysterious spaceship, which turns out to be from the game Galaga, the president turns to his best friend Brenner to try and work out a method to sort out the problem, as he had a talent when it came to the old video games. There other close friend, Ludlow, works out that the Aliens took the video tape, that was sent to them from Nasa, as a declaration of war and as the tape was sent to them in video game format, they were sending video game characters to destroy earth. They also give earth 3 life's, like any ordinary video game at that time, so the first one with 3 wins would win there destructive game. Anyway, they turn to the Fire Blaster to help them save earth and the humans that they have taken as a reward. They also get help from Violet (Michelle Monaghan), who works for the president and Q'Bert who was a gift from the Aliens because they won a couple of there matches. This movie could have really worked if it was taken seriously. The film company was lucky to get the rights to use so many of the old video game classics but the director didn't take full advantage of the opportunity. The silly jokes throughout the movie, we're really poor and the corny ending really let the movie down. With that aside, I did stick with the movie because I didn't know what direction the director was going to take the whole video game element of the film. I liked the Pac-Man game with the cars and the Donkey Kong game looked pretty impressive but I just couldn't take the childish humour, which is in many of Adam Sandler movies nowadays. Watchable, because of the arcade game content!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Chris Columbus, 57, who brought you some all time classics like Home Alone I & II, Mrs. Doubtfire, Nine Months, Stepmom, the great Bicentennial Man, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief. He's got quite an impressive portfolio, which is why he was given this hard project to direct. Visually, he did do a great job in terms of making it look real and as he didn't write the script, I can't blame him for the silly storyline. I'm slowly beginning to dislike Adam Sandler, 49, movies because his latest films have been pretty poor. I haven't seen the Cobbler yet but I wasn't impressed with Grown Ups 2, That's My Boy, Just Go With It or the awful Jack & Jill. Blended was watchable, mainly because of the scenes with Terry Crews, who he teams up with again in the upcoming Ridiculous 6, which also stars some top class comedians. Anyway, there's no rumours about a sequel for this movie so I would like to see a serious director take on a fresh movie with this old video game concept.Budget: $88million Worldwide Gross: $244millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/sci-fi/comedies starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Brian Cox, Sean Bean and Dan Aykroyd. 4/10",Pixels
40,TheMovieDiorama,Pixels mishandles nostalgia whilst harnessing the memorability of a dusty arcade machine.,2,3 July 2019,"As a video gamer myself, my childhood was in the midst of this iconic cultural movement. Pac-Man, Space Invaders, Galaga, Donkey Kong and of course Tetris. So for a film to use these legendary titles, well, the nostalgia should've instantly won me over. But wait! What's this? Happy Madison Productions is involved? The same writer as 'Grown Ups 2'? Urgh. And this is why we can't have nice things in life. An extraterrestrial race misinterpret video games as a declaration of war (oh, a time capsule of a championship was sent out to space for no apparent reason), to which they mimic the characters within the games and send them down to destroy Earth.A planet hosting an array of powerful nations with the capacity to decimate cities with the click of a button. But you see, the army just can't get to grips with the pattern of Centipede or Arkanoid. They Just aren't trained enough in arcade gaming! So naturally the army recruit a former Pac-Man champion, his video-gaming nemesis, a random conspiracy theorist and the President of the frickin' United States. I do not want to be in a world where Kevin James is the President and Adam Sandler stops an alien invasion. Nope! Anyway, as you would expect from the onslaught of recent films that Sandler's studio pump out every year, it's bad. Not even an entertaining ""turn your brain off"" kinda way. It's just flat out terrible.Herlihy's writing was incomprehensibly painful to say the least. No character personalities, no bite to the plot and certainly no humour. The story exists to play on the nostalgia of its audience, without actually going anywhere with it. Colombus' direction is bland and predictable right down to the inner code. The cast were just playing themselves, and Sandler happened to drag fine actors into this mess. Monaghan, Shaw, Cox and Bean, come on you fine actors! Just say no next time. Q*Bert has way too much screen time and is, for some unknown reason, physically communicating in English. At one point, a certain character engages in intercourse with their video game crush. And, wait for it, produces five baby Q*Berts. Five of them! Nope. I'm done. Why the hell is Iwatani involved? Why does Max Headroom look worse?Aside from the semi-decent pixelated visual effects and Serena Williams being the queen that she is, Pixels is one glitchy affair that is essentially unplayable.",Pixels
41,gwnightscream,Pretty Good!,6,12 January 2020,"This 2015 sci-fi comedy stars Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan and Peter Dinklage. Sandler plays Brenner, an electronics installer who helps his pal, Cooper (James) who is the President of the U.S. when Pixel aliens take the form of 80's video/arcade games and invade Earth. Brenner was an arcade pro as a kid and uses his skills to defeat the pixels, but with help. Monaghan (The Heartbreak Kid) plays Violet, a defense aide of Cooper who Brennan argues and finds romance with and Dinklage (Games of Thrones) plays Eddie, a convict who played against Brennan as a kid. Sean Bean (Goldeneye), Brian Cox (Super Troopers) and Dan Aykroyd (Ghostbusters) also appear. This is a pretty good flick, the cast is decent and the effects are amazing.

Directed by the same guy that brought us Mrs Doubtfire and Bicentennial Man this film is about a group of adults who were video game nerds back in 1982 and some strange stuff starts to happen as video game charcthers like Pacman and Donkey Kong come alive so its up to Sam Breener(Adam Sandler), Lover good(Josh Gad) and co to try and defeat the charcthers that have came alive or its game over.

43,subxerogravity,Swing and miss!,5,25 July 2015,"As a kid from the 80s who remembers playing Pac-Man and Donkey Kong on a coin-up, I thought it was a fantastic concept for a movie, but it was put together so horribly.Adam Sandler gets to live out a fantasy of most gamers. In a similar plot to the Last Star Fighter, the main character Sam, after being nothing else but good at video games all his miserable life, somehow becomes the only man on Earth with the skill to defeat an alien invasion in the form of arcade classics (If the alien invasion was in the form of Sonic the Hedgehog, best believe I'm your guy).That sounds like a good idea, but let's face it, it's been a long time since Sandler's Joe Schmo routine has been that appealing. I'm sure he had fun on the set playing out a full scale level of Donkey Kong, but it was not fun to watch at all. I will say the best video game reenactment in the film was when they went up against Pac Man, that was cool, but all the other pixel battles just looked lame.Sandler's good at surrounding himself with friends he likes to work with, like the charming Kevin James who I loved as the U.S President and best friend to Sam. Peter Dinklage was also hilarious as Billy Mitchell another middle age man who reached his peak after becoming Donkey Kong champ.I think I feel most sorry for Chris Columbus, he's a pretty good director but he could not turn the short film this is based on (and I'm sure is far better) into something worth sitting through.The movie was good for a few chuckles and it was cool seeing some of my favorite old school game ions back in 8-bit form, but the movie falls to the rock bottom of being anything at all. Game over.",Pixels

But will they save the day before it's too late?Like some of Adam Sandler comedies, this is not a great film, but it never tries to be, but it is entertaining, I did laugh a few, end enjoyed the effects. Adam Sandler is good, so was Michelle Monaghan, I won't forget Kevin James. But the real scene steelers that take the cake are Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad, they get the most funny lines, and never go too far over the top. I enjoyed this movie, it never tries to be anything more than what it is, just a fun time, sometimes that is all you need. The cast play off each other perfectly, but if you where not entertained by this, I'm sorry that you weren't.",Pixels
45,stevendbeard,Classic Arcade Video Gamers Should Enjoy It,6,24 July 2015,"I saw ""Pixels"", starring Adam Sandler-Blended, The Longest Yard_2005; Kevin James-The Paul Blart movies, 50 First Dates; Michelle Monaghan- Mission:Impossible 3, Mr. & Mrs. Smith; Josh Gad-The Wedding Ringer, The Rocker and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_tv, X-Men:Days of Future Past.I like some of Adam Sandlers' movies and some, I don't. This one was pretty good. It starts in 1982 with Adam, Kevin, Josh & Peter-portrayed as kids, of course-and they are doing what most kids did during that time period, play arcade video games. For those not old enough to know, back then you had stores-or arcades-that had lots of video games that you played by inserting a quarter in to a slot. Adam and Peter were in a championship arcade game contest and the video of their match is put into a time capsule-along with other stuff, too-and sent into space, in search of intelligent life on other planets. Switch to the present and it seems that the intelligent life that found the space capsule misunderstood the intentions of us fun loving earthlings and thought it was a declaration of war. They developed attacking squads made of energy that are based on the arcade games-such as Pacman, Donkey Kong, Centipede and Space Invaders-and they use videos of 1980's celebrities with their voices dubbed to convey their demands. One of the funniest ones is Hall & Oates. Adam now works for an electronics store-think Best Buy-and he makes home installations or repairs. Kevin is now the President of the U.S.-think Chris Christie-but he is still friends with Adam. Josh still lives at home with his grandmother and believes in lots of conspiracy theories. Peter is in prison, fantasizing about a three way with Serena Williams & Martha Stewart. When the aliens start attacking, guess who Kevin calls on? His old arcade gaming buddies because, who else would know how to fight giant centipedes? Michelle is in the military and helps develop the weapons Adam and company use. There are several cameos; I remember seeing Dan Aykroyd, Sean Bean, Brian Cox and Jane Krakowski. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and video game violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 45 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Pixels
46,estebangonzalez10,Recycled Sandler humor with some action adventure in the mix,4,25 July 2015,"""I believe that some alien life-force, has sent real life video games, to attack us.""Chris Columbus, the man who directed the first two Harry Potter films as well as Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Adventures of Babysitting, and many more family friendly films that I actually enjoyed, now directs Adam Sandler in Pixels, a film that aims to appeal to those adults that grew up in the early 80's playing classic arcade games, but unfortunately it only ends up being entertaining for younger audiences due to its cliché jokes and formulaic structure. I must confess that I once was a huge Adam Sandler fan and watched everything he did from his Billy Madison days up to Jack and Jill in 2011 (with Chuck and Larry being the only exception, which somehow I miraculously missed). As a young teen I found his movies hilarious, but as I grew older his schtick got repetitive and I somehow decided to give up on him. I hadn't seen another film starring Sandler since Jack and Jill, but decided to give this one a try for nostalgic sake and because Columbus's films usually appealed to me despite his films being overly sentimental at times. It didn't hurt that Peter Dinklage was also starring in this film since I love what he does (his short scene in Elf is one of my favorites and he is awesome in Game of Thrones). All these factors managed to convince me to watch Pixels despite my low expectations and I honestly got what I was expecting. It's as if Adam Sandler directs all his comedies because they are so similar in tone despite never having directed, but I guess the directors always let him improvise and he ends up making the same jokes in every movie. The only positive feedback I'll give Pixels is that it did manage to engage with the younger audiences; my ten year old brother had a blast, so it might make some money at the box office. Based on Patrick Jean's own screenplay for a short film he made in 2010 (which seems far more appealing to me), this feature film opens in the 80's with a group of kids who grew up loving arcade games. Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) is so good at predicting these game patterns that he signs up to compete in an arcade national championship. His closest friend, Cooper (Jared Riley), is there cheering for him and he truly believes Brenner is destined for great things in life. During the tournament they also befriend a young boy named Ludlow (Jacob Shinder) who is obsessed with a cyber game character named Lady Lisa (Ashley Benson). Unfortunately, Brenner is defeated by Eddie (Andrew Bambridge), a loud mouthed arcade lover who goes by the nickname of fire blaster. The film then jumps to the present where we discover Brenner (Adam Sandler) hasn't really accomplished anything in life. He installs technical equipment for a company called Nerd. Cooper (Kevin James) however has become the President of the nation. Nerd sends Brenner to Violet's (Michelle Monaghan) home to install the latest gadgets for her young son Matty (Matt Lintz). Brenner and Violet have a small moment, but when he tries to lean in and kiss her things get ugly between them. Right after that awkward moment Brenner receives a call from Cooper about an alien attack on Earth (and so does Violet who is then revealed to be a Lieutenant). Apparently these aliens have attacked using the arcade game format created through pixels, and the only way to defeat them is similar to the way they played the game. Brenner enlists the help of Ludlow (Josh Gad) and his archenemy Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to try to defeat these alien invaders and save the Earth.As ridiculous or appealing as the premise sounds (depending on whether or not you're nostalgic over these classic arcade games) the greatest problem with Pixels is that its incredibly hard to believe some of the relationships between these characters. The first time Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan's characters meet, the dialogue between them is so phony and forced that it makes it impossible to relate to. That scene was probably one of the worst I've seen all year. Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Brian Cox can be funny people, but they play the same characters they've been playing in recent years. Dinklage's Fire Blaster seems to be either hit or miss for some people, and I actually found his character to be the funniest in the movie. No one here is actually trying hard and the film is proof of that, but audiences that are simply looking to escape for a couple of hours might find it amusing. I still don't know what Jane Krakowski was doing in this film since her character isn't given anything to do despite her comedic talents. She should've been used more. Pixels is recycled Sandler material that will only appeal to hardcore 80's nostalgic gamers and young kids who enjoy pretty much any adventure. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Pixels
47,iquine,I Heard This Was Bad Yet Watched It Anyway,5,24 August 2018,"(Flash Review)If you spent oodles of hours in front of your Atari, Intellivision or Colecovision your skills may save the world one day! And today is that day! Martians have misinterpreted a time capsule, sent in the 80s by the US government, containing some video game footage on a video cassette as a declaration of war. They should have used a Betamax tape and this problem would have been avoided!! So the Martians come to earth in the form of your favorite video game nemesis: Donkey Kong, Centipede, etc.. and friendly Pac-Man and Q*bert. By the way, Q*bert is really cute in this. Meanwhile, a storyline of how two kids who battled for Donkey Kong championship in the 80s is formed and quickly fast-forward to their lives of today and of course they'll be the ones saving us from the Martina attack. Mix in a cheesy love story, a dash of social commentary on video games of today vs the 80s originals and a terribly planned and executed storyline involving Kevin James as president. This had the potential to be much better and different than say TRON since it is a silly and goofy premise...but it was rooted with a good amount of charm that it did leverage. If they had only put a bare minimum of effort into the government storyline it could have been funny as well as fully palatable. So yes, there are some very bad scenes, crap plot points but if you chill out, there is charm and amusement to be found here. How many game characters can you spot?",Pixels

With just a bit more effort, and perhaps a more skillful director behind the camera, it could've been the kind of fun, agenda-free summer popcorn movie Hollywood doesn't - or perhaps can't - make anymore.If you like Adam Sandler and his trademark brand of humor (and for the record, I do more often than not) then you're still likely going to be able to mine 'Pixels' for a reasonable share of laughs and nostalgic rewards, but for everyone else your mileage will most certainly vary.",Pixels

I enjoyed the idea of a movie where kids would win a video game tournament, and they would send those games and other stuff into space in hopes that aliens would find it;the aliens did and misinterpret as a declaration of war and retaliate with those games! Adam Sandler and Kevin James were the perfect choices for the leads. Especially Adam Sandler. I liked the choices of the ""battle games"" with Gallaga, Centipede, Pac Man, and Donkey Kong, and cameos by Frogger, QBert, and others. My favorite scenes include Kevin James in the school (reminiscent of George W Bush!), the battle scenes, and the scene in the prison. Anyone nostalgic about these games will enjoy this movie.

53,AudioFileZ,For First Gen Gamers & Sandler Fans...Others Need To Pass,6,4 October 2016,"Ten minutes in to Pixels and I'm sure it's an Adam Sandler movie. It's really dumb, it's sentimental, and there's always something about Sandler I simply like. Sandler, not unusually, plays the ""sad-sack"" who has untapped potential all around, but has not used it. In this case he was a nerd who got big, but was still a nerd. I immediately love the fact that all realism is suspended when as a N.E.R.D. team member he goes on an install and ends up with a luscious mom-babe crying on his shoulder. NOT. Then the government's control central that decides we are being attacked looks like they spent all of $999 w/ taxes included. Does any of this matter? Well, it's duly noted and largely, at least early-on, negated as this is an Adam Sandler movie. Best early line: ""M.I.T.?, Yes, Mississippi Institute of Technology, not the one you were thinking of"".Perhaps a tie: ""not this version Blue Lagoon""!O.K., this movie is totally lame, and, strangely, I mean this as a compliment. It really doesn't aspire to be anything but. I'd say it succeeds quite well in the low-brow intentions it wears on it's shoulders. I was a even a bit too mature at the time to get all of the nods this movie obviously references quite regularly. That said, hell, it's an Adam Sandler movie and except for his faulty recent detour of that African blended family movie whatever that was, this is, at the end of the day, an Adam Sandler movie and I find value in that.Truth is there is so many truisms in this movie as outrageous as they are. Best line: ""In 2005 he was caught hacking cell phone companies and adding one of those fees you don't have any idea was it is"". In other words: ""right on!"". Basically this is a cable TV movie that aspires to be more. For it's intended audience it mostly succeeds. Lameness, and 80's neediness, is cool. Bottom line: Adam Sandler's world has shrunk but he still can speak to the faithful few.",Pixels

Please see it just for the cgi, it's awesome. If you have the dvd look for the short on how they created one of the cute characters. The comedy is snappy, almost witty, and yet nothing new, but it works. You'll smile rather than laugh out loud. The story is absurd, which is exactly what we pay Hollywood for, and with this one they've outdone themselves. There's a classic chase. There's a great cameo appearance. There's a cleverly worded love affair. There's a great homage to nerds of the 1980s and overall, I thought, a really whacky satire of big budget invasion movies. It's just such fun.",Pixels

Sam was friends with ""Chewy"" Cooper, the Crane game expert, and Ludlow, the loner kid who was obsessed to a game character named Lady Lisa. Now thirty years later Cooper and Sam still meet frequently although Cooper is now the president and Sam works as an electronics installer. One day The USAF base at Guam is attacked by alien entity. The next day Sam serves a house call where he meets Violet and her son Matty. He thought she's into him but he was wrong. They both eventually meet again at the White House as the president calls them to address the Guam problem. Sam gets kicked out of the meeting due to interrupting a general. That night Sam meets Ludlow who reveals that he knows about the aliens and that they're using the old arcade game footage to create the attackers. Sam and Ludlow advises the president about the next attack on India, but they're ignored and Taj Mahal gets pixelated. The government asks Sam and Ludlow to train Navy SEALS to win on old arcade games, but they eventually have to handle the situation themselves as the aliens attack London with Centipede game.Successful in London, the president equips them and adds ""Fire Blaster"" Eddie to their ranks and forms The Arcaders. They prepare for the next attack on New York City against Pac-Man. As Pac-Man glides along the streets of New York, The Arcaders use cars as ghosts to catch Pac-Man, Eddie manages to kill Pac-Man but it respawns, spending 1UP. Ludlow manages to distract it and Eddie again manages to hit it, seemingly able to move very fast to track the Pac-Man. But the last Pac-Man tricks Eddie's car into the river, and Sam manages to trick it to spend enough time to expire its power pill. They then celebrate with the president, but then another message comes from the aliens claiming the humans have violated the war rules and thus they will attack to claim earth. Matty figures out that Eddie cheated in Pac-Man, just before he gets kidnapped by the aliens. The aliens attack with their mother-ship hovering above the city.More video game characters come out from the mother-ship including Lady Lisa. Ludlow manages to tame her and they kiss. Eddie and even president Cooper joins the Arcaders to fight the aliens. Sam, Violet and Cooper sneak into the mother-ship and faces a live-sized Donkey Kong game with Matty and two other captives at the top. Sam gets reduced self esteem over the game but Matty opens the truth about Eddie cheating. This convinces Sam and he then overkills the Donkey Kong with the hammer. This freezes the aliens and they get called back into the mother-ship. The Arcaders gets awarded for their efforts and Eddie admits Sam as the best gamer in the world.The story as a whole is very lame. It's so predictable and didn't incite any more curiosity past the level that the trailer incited. The opening feels very nice with all those nostalgic elements, although then again, those nostalgia will only appeal to those people over thirty who ever experienced those oldies-but goodies arcade games. Yet they will look weird, if not stupid, to the eyes of younger audiences who never had the experience of facing pixelated characters.Furthermore the story unfolds very strangely at times. Ludlow's appearance, how Lady Lisa fit into the story, Cooper as a president; all those feels under developed at best. The characters also feel very much under developed. They only rely on the opening sequence to establish the character backgrounds. Yet they don't really incorporate the changes that those characters gone through over the years. This also happens to the characters that appear later when the main characters are adults like Violet and Matty.The comedy is just at an okay level if we see it as an ordinary comedy movie. But then there's the level of the cast like Adam Sandler and Josh Gad. The comedy feels very much lacking if we compare this movie to other Sandler movies. Adam Sandler did well on comedies based on simpler basic premises and romantic comedies. But he didn't handle this type of movie very well, I suppose. For me, I enjoy his previous The Cobbler better than this one.The SFX looks quite convincing but it doesn't rally help the movie as a whole since the script didn't really hold itself solidly. The acting overall feels very much at a standard level. Adam Sandler did his usual level of comedy movie, with grins all over the place. Josh Gad provides a nice performance for his angle but his role is only that significant. Peter Dinklage surprisingly acted his parts below his usual level. Maybe he's not really fit for comedies.My final say for Pixels (2015) is just a 5 out of 10 score, and not recommendation for this one. It's just that much of an entertainment due to lacking in many levels.",Pixels
56,rgkarim,"Nostalgic, Ridiculous, Trip to the 80's",5,25 July 2015,"Everyone says video games are bad for you as they are too violent or rot your mind. In Adam Sandler's latest comedy, those comments have been magnified as a race of alien beings misinterpret a deep space satellite transmission as a declaration of war and have chosen classic arcade games as their soldiers. Yes my friends, my next review is on none other than Pixels, a movie that may be one of the most ridiculous adventures to grace the theater. Hi I'm Robbie K and you're just in time for another review on the latest ""comedy"" release. When you think of Adam Sandler, as well as the plot summary above, you might tag the comedian with words like ridiculous, stupid, immature, etc. Well that might be true, but let's focus on some good qualities of his unique imagiantion. Pixels jumps back into the 80's to bring nostalgic memories of the endangered arcades to nerds like me and amplifies to monstrous proportions. After a fun trip back in time, we jump to the modern day world where Sandler and his typical crew are again the oddballs in popular culture. This is where one of the positives comes in, and that is Sandler's poking at the trends, stereotypes, and culture. I chuckled at the writer's jabs at our government system, mocking their obsession with war, country strives, and glorification of the military. In a manner along the lines of Revenge of the Nerds, nerds are shown to be powerful, using predictability and practice as the mighty tools of defense. This tired and true story line has a nice refreshing twist using games as the medium, but the story is lacking in so many ways. Most stories running tangent to the main plot are very shallow, nothing more than predictable moments that center on wishes shared by our beloved arcaders. How the aliens saw this as a threat, what they looked like, heck even the reasoning of their choices were cut short to be dumped into the flood of jokes this movie is filled with. Speaking of jokes, Pixels is more of Adam Sandler's tactics of being kiddy, geeky, and somehow sweet at the same time. Pixels has loads of his overdramatic, throaty yelling, often partnered with a drawn out with someone rambling on and making a fool of themselves. Other characters were drawn in to the awkward vortex as well, Peter Dinkelage especially dropping into the ludicrous 80's punk with a heavy accent that is more annoying than funny for me. However, I did enjoy some of the humor in this movie, especially witty quips at modern culture. Being a gamer myself I also laughed at a few of the gaming scenarios as well, despite many of them being ruined in the trailers. And yet Pixels humor gets lost in the teams inability to realize enough is enough. Sandler and his crew take their jokes too far, and don't let up until it is too late and the jokes are super stale that only kids will be cracking up at them. Because of this lack of balance, the movie's humor really only stays consistently funny to kids, who we know can't get enough of the things they love. Let's turn our attention to the game scenes now. Pixels art directors took an interesting path for this film, as they brought the pixelated warriors to life. Most of the soldiers look like high definition renditions of minecraft sprites, obviously designed to pop out of the screen in the 3-D viewings. The arcade games are colorful though, sporting the flashy vibrant hues and shades that caught our attentions all those years ago. Life is further imbued with the sound editing, the 8-bit bings, bongs, and other digital noises filling the high definition speakers and bringing you into the moment. The designers even translated the games 2-D movements into fluid 3-D excitement as the monsters and ships battle our real life defenders. As for the adventure itself, it's okay. The battles with the light guns start out exciting, but it doesn't take long before you realize it's just repeated movements of our heroes shooting left and right with the enemies barely adapting their strategy. As the journey continues, the actions gets better as the situations get a dab of cleverness added them all with an arcade twist. Butthey take the scenes too far, and cross into the overdramatic zone and losing its majesty. Exaggerated moves and simple comedy can't beef up the sequences, or improve the movie for that matter. The only thing that might have helped was the kicking 80's soundtrack that played throughout the movie, another fine moment of nostalgia. Okay so Pixels isn't the greatest movie ever, and it may be more of the same Sandler movie magic we've come to know. However, the movie is a fun trip back to a colorful time, and retro gamers will appreciate the references they make throughout the film. There isn't much of a story and things do go stale from time to time, but I think younger audience members will enjoy the adventure to be had. Word of warning, this movie has some fair bit of cursing. My recommendations are to hold off on this movie, as despite the cool special effects, it is not worth the high price of a ticket. The scores are:Comedy/Action/Sci-Fi: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",Pixels
57,framptonhollis,Another Adam Sandler Movie...,2,23 August 2015,"This is the 2nd worst film I've seen from 2015 so far. the first being ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"",both Happy Madison Productions. Oh boy.Adam Sandler is certainly no Clark Gable when it comes to being a leading man. He is just a tired 48 year old man, he's better off playing a single father in his late 40s. That's what he looks like. HE DOESN""T LOOK LIKE HE'S GOING TO SAVE THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh yeah, and Kevin James is the president. Yup. That is ""Pixels"" for you. A WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!!!!!!!The film is disturbingly clichéd. Oh is it clichéd. How is it that Adam Sandler gets Michelle Monaghan's character as his lover! That just doesn't make sense! Of course, in the beginning, they hate each other, but you know what happens. You know. It is so predictable, but that's what you're going to get.The first 3 minutes were kind of cool. But that's because I liked the song. That Cheap Trick song was the best part of the whole movie. The WHOLE MOVIE! But, hey, there were a few positive things about the movie. The first 20 minutes had a few brief funny moments, and the special effects were pretty neat. The concept and action sequences were pretty clever, but the battle scenes, overall, become boring. That's the thing about these modern big-budget movies, the action sequences just become boring after a while. They also try to fill these action sequences with ""jokes"". Of course, jokes has to be in quotes, because these ""jokes"" are basically Josh Gad falling down and yelling.Overall, this movie is an embarrassment, but Adam Sandler doesn't care, he just wants your money.",Pixels
58,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Everything works except the characters & how they're written,5,31 December 2015,"Although video games have not been around as long as the car or other significant technological advances, it certainly has an equal amount of an impact in today's' society. Which only started as a couple lit up dots on a screen in the early 70s, has turned into a worldwide phenomenon of competitions of expanded universes with detailed landscapes as far as the eye can see. It's amazing looking at the transformation of video games. The time that was most nostalgic for much of the older generation was during the 1980s when video gaming was starting to become a big thing. Kids around the nation would line up in front of buildings filled with arcade machines looking to spend their 25 cents to see who would be the next gaming king. It was a time when things were much simpler but still just as fun. French director Patrick Jean had an interesting idea. What would it be like if the video games we used to play with began attacking our world? What would happen? For the two-minute short film that Jean provided, it was a unique idea. For this big screen production of Jean's idea, the concept remains the same but now it has things added to it that don't make it as fun. Adam Sandler plays Sam Brenner, a frustrated electronics repairman who longs for his gaming days back in the 80s. However he gets this opportunity after what appears to be old video games attacking the city. So he gathers up his associates, Cooper (Kevin James), Ludlow (Josh Gad) and Eddie (Peter Dinklage) to help fight back. With a screenplay penned by Tim Herlihy (a frequent Sandler collaborator) and Timothy Dowling (Role Models (2008)) knowing what might be included in the story ended up being predictable. A major element that wasn't necessary to include was the love interest subplots for multiple characters. Practically every main character has a struggling relationship with somebody and they all look to better themselves. Brenner ends up meeting a divorced mom, Violet (Michelle Monaghan) only through forced exposition of her son. What child talks to a stranger like that? There's also Ludlow's fantasy of being with Lady Lisa from a game he plays. Even Brenner's childhood rival Eddie wants to be with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams. All these threads tally up and just pad the film making the momentum slow down. Oh and don't forget the potty humor - a trademark of Happy Madison productions. There's also a series of plot contrivances that make no sense and a number of noticeable continuity errors that add to the confusion of how some video game characters are more developed than others are. A blatant example is Q*bert; how does he have a conscience but not Pac-Man? Even with these problems, this could've been tolerable if the characters were funny. Unfortunately very few are. Kevin James plays one of the goofiest presidents seen on screen and Josh Gad plays it mostly awkward the whole time. Sandler occasionally spews out a line worth of a chuckle because he's trying to sound like an old timer, but it's not often. The rest of the time he just sounds like he's saying whatever came to mind at the time. It doesn't even matter that Sandler is cast with his usual buddies but at least switch up the role. His female co-star is equally sporadic. Dinklage just being snobby stuck up gamer was the best part. There are other appearances from credible actors like Brian Cox, and Sean Bean but they end up being wasted. It's sad that all these issues are just as powerful as the positives. For direction at least, Chris Columbus headed this project instead of Sandler's regulars. The visuals are a nice too. The special effects that make up the video game characters and how they pixilated the surroundings is wonderfully colorful. The director of photography was Amir Mokri (Man of Steel (2013) & Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)), a guy who has plenty of work dealing with blockbuster scope films.The other bonus of to this movie is the nostalgic factor. For those who really enjoyed playing games like Asteroids, Q*bert, Frogger, Super Mario Bros., Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, Centipede, Duck Hunt, Tetris, etc. - the fact that seeing these iconic games on the big screen is awesome looking. It does kind of go back to how video game movies don't work though because a gamer would rather play and be interactive than submissive and just watching a game happen. Lastly, the film score was decently made too. Composed by Henry Jackman (this would be his second video game score - his first being to Disney's Wreck-It Ralph (2012)), the score lacks a main theme but does keep the energy moving throughout the action scenes. Even for the slower scenes Jackman has tunes that sound okay. And of course, since this is a film that hearkens back to the 1980s, the soundtrack does include 80s bands like Loverboy and Queen. They even got Daryl Hall and John Oates to play a cameo. That's awesome. The good is equally countered by the bad. It has decent music, colorful special effects, clear cinematography and a large nostalgic factor based on its library of retro video games. Sadly all this is bogged down cliché casting and character development, hit and miss comedy and not enough focus on the video games.",Pixels
59,rannynm,"Hilarious, possibly the funniest movie of the year!",9,25 July 2015,"From Donkey Kong to Pac-man, from Adam Sandler to Josh Gad, this film really has anything you could imagine. Pixels is the funniest film of the year so far!This is, of course, a comedy. However, along with that, there is a lot of drama and a hint of romance all packed into one huge adventure made for the entire family to enjoy.The story features Brenner (Adam Sandler) who installs electronic equipment for a living. However, when an alien species attacks in the form of 1980s classic video games, Benner and his friends are the only ones capable of stopping them. And, to do so, they must beat the aliens, as if they were in the game.This film is fantastic! The special effects are absolutely mind blowing. There are no boring scenes and some special effects are simply mind-blowing fantastic. I still can't figure out how they did it some of them. The acting is spot on. One scene I really liked is where two kids are competing on classic arcade machines with Donkey Kong loaded on them. The director makes it so you see them playing, their points and the screen as well as the reflection of the games in their eyes. It looks amazingzing!My favorite scene is when they are facing Pac-Man in mini coopers that are designed to be the ghosts who chase and destroy Pac-Man. When Brenner is the only one left and Pac-Man just gets a power up which allows him to eat the ghosts, Brenner pulls of an awesome and insane stunts to run away and it is action packed and just stupendous to watch!This film is good for kids, adults and gamers of course. I do believe people in their 30s and 40s would like this the most because they can understand a lot of the older game references. I don't think younger kids should watch this due to the adult language and mature references. I recommend it for ages 9 through 18 and older and give it 5 out of 5 pixelated stars.

60,Rob_Taylor,"Ignore the haters, it isn't that bad. In fact, it's quite amusing.",7,10 October 2015,"So, yet again, I have put off watching a movie based on other people's reviews. As with Fantastic Four, I was expecting a horrible mess. You know what I discovered? That people are idiots, and they often write reviews.Pixels is a simple comedy about video game characters coming to life and attacking the world. It is a ridiculous premise and the movie doesn't take itself at all seriously whilst delivering on that premise.So why then, do I see people complaining about the plot, the characterisation, even the ""unrealistic"" characters? Simple answer is, they are ""bandwagon"" reviewers. The type of people to jump on the hate wagon ""just because"".Can you really be annoyed at the ""unrealistic"" portrayal of 8-bit video game characters? I guess, if you never experienced that era of gaming and expect everything to be photo-realistic.In a comedy where the world is threatened by video game characters, can you really be upset that there isn't more development of the individual characters or plot? I guess, if you were expecting some kind of serious alien invasion movie.So my advice to all and sundry is...take any review with the minimum effort of 10 lines with a pinch of salt. The person can't be bothered to make an effort to explain why they didn't like the movie. They just wanted to rant. Also, click on their name. See how many reviews they have done, and of what. Often you'll find that particular review is their only one. Or you'll see a pattern of bad reviews.This works just as well for glowing reviews, of course, which you should also treat with a huge pinch of salt.Likewise, automatically ignore any review that gives a 1 or a 10 unless you trust the reviewer.It is sad that most review sites these days seem prone to this kind of ""ballot-stuffing"" so you, the reader, must evaluate everything you read based on the motives of the reviewer, not the content of the review itself.So what is my motive for this review? Well, if I had to put it in words, just to think for yourselves. Whatever I say about Pixels, is my own opinion. I have no hidden agenda, unless it is to point out how you can't trust reviews.But enough shaking of the head at reviews...what about the movie? Pixels is harmless fun. That is all there is to it. It isn't the best written comedy, but I don't think they wanted to make a laugh-out-loud, snort-your-coke over the floor film. It is gentle comedy, with little if any swearing, and relying on the visuals and the actors' performances for the humour.Some have decried it as being sexist. But those people seem more intent on being offended for the sake of being offended. Any sexism on display is outright highlighted by the film for the purpose of being over the top. In other words, for comedic value. Yet some people seem to think that even this is too much. Personally, I'm tired of people being offended on my behalf. Apparently, there is a fine line between being offended at something, and being a preachy knob-end trying to ram your views down others' throats.If you remember the 80's, and remember video games, then there is nothing here that will shake your tree, offence-wise. If you didn't live through that era, and would prefer all movies removed anything that you might take exception to, then give it a miss.So, in the interests of balanced reviewing:SUMMARY FOR NORMAL PEOPLE: Entertaining light comedy based on 80's video games. Competent performances and a script that never takes itself seriously combine to make enjoyable viewing. Not something you'll watch twice, but fun for what it is.SUMMARY FOR... (WELL, FILL IN YOUR OWN SELF-IDENTITY HERE): Horrific mess of poorly written characters, script and with terrible CGI. Sexist and full of objectivism against women. Terrible! Avoid at all costs.PS: I just thought of something. Maybe we need an additional ratings system. Something along the lines of ""Warning! This film contains scenes that are likely to be offensive to delicate butterflies and fluffy bunnies."" Does that sound about right?",Pixels

63,Screen_Blitz,Goofy Adam Sandler action comedy that does little to satisfy,4,8 November 2015,"Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage take on the video game world in this goofy sci-action comedy that should have been funnier than it was. Sandler plays Sam Brenner who grew as an expert gamer on arcade games in the 80s. After facing a humiliating loss by Eddie, nicknamed the ""Fireblaster"" (Peter Dinklage) at an arcade competition, Brenner's life lands him in a job working for company selling flatscreen televisions. When the world becomes under attacked by aliens from the game Galaga as well as characters from other classic Atari games who are set destroying earth. Teaming up with his eccentric friend Ludlow (Josh Gas), President Will Cooper (Kevin James), and Eddie, Brenner puts his video game skills to the test in attempt to save the world before the video game villain onslaught madness. Directed by Chris Columbus, this film features some of the iconic figures of the classic Atari games from the 80s including Pac-Man (who is a bad guy this time around), Q'Bert, Arkanoid, Tetris, Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Space Invaders, and Centipede.I had rather low expectations for this movie. The idea of the characters fighting against pixelated video games characters who invade Earth does sound quite interesting on paper, but looks utterly silly on screen. The shots of Pac-Man attacking a downtown area and the aliens from Galaga destroying the buildings and major landmarks like the monuments does attract children's attention, but will very likely lose attention from adults when they see this being an Adam Sandler movie. Although this movie does manage to bring out a few laughs here and there, it does little satisfy. The action sequences and the bloated use of CGI pixelated characters are fun to watch for those who grew in the 80s during the age of Atari, but can't save this movie from the disappointment it is. Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad are the only ones manage to have anything remotely funny to say, while Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast are left sitting on the sidelines of humorous dialogue. Pac-Man creator Toru Iwatani makes a rather goofy appearance midpoint through the film before getting his hand chewed off by Pacman, leaving him with pixel dripping arm. The problem is the movie spends the majority of the time drenching the audience with non-stop CGI pixel galore, and neglects its effort on coming up with true laughter.Pixels is one of those comedies that will very likely appeal to kids, but feel like a chore to watch for adults. While this isn't one of Adam Sandler's worst comedies like Jack and Jill and That's My Boy, it certainty doesn't fit the bill and suffers from a weak script. Those who carry interest in retro gaming may find a little entertainment in this, others will be left with strong discontent.",Pixels
64,Troy_Campbell,Not a complete disaster.,5,12 September 2015,"Since its U.S. release a few months ago, critics have universally panned this kid-friendly action blockbuster as a shallow, by-the-numbers adventure with very little entertainment value. Well, it is shallow and it is by the numbers, but it's hardly the steaming pile of digital poop the tepid critical (and commercial) reception would have you believe. Despite a great central concept – 80s computer games attack Earth! – and competent CGI, it doesn't quite reach the level of action excitement it's aiming for with a handful of pedestrian sequences culminating in a cluttered and underwhelming finale. Where it scores power-up points is in the comedy department; the dialogue unexpectedly funny at times with a mix of on-the-nose jokes for the younger audience members and more subtle gags for the adults. There's also the small matter of Peter Dinklage (rocking the greatest mullet you'll witness in 2015), who provides a spark of humorous arrogance every time he's on screen as conceited gamer Eddie 'Fireblaster' Plant. The rest of the cast can't keep up with the little master, although Josh Gad lands a few laughs as conspiracy nut Ludlow Lamonsoff and Michelle Monaghan is reliable as ever as the sane member of the ragtag group. Adam Sandler and Kevin James are, well, Adam Sandler and Kevin James, for better and mostly for worse; the former offering a lazy but mercifully toned-down lead turn, the latter dishing up a frighteningly weird take on the U.S. President. It won't be up for any awards (except maybe a Razzie or two) and is undoubtedly a missed opportunity considering the awesome premise, but Pixels isn't a complete disaster thanks to its comedic successes.",Pixels
65,Pumpkin_Man,Old School Nostalgic Fun!!!,10,25 July 2015,"Wow, I can't believe so many people are hating this movie just because it has Adam Sandler in it. I think it has the potential to become a cult classic years down the road. The idea of video game aliens coming from outer space to attack us and the only hope to defend mankind are some video game nerds from the 80's who knew what gaming is all about. I'm a Sandler fan, and there were actually times where Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage had funnier lines. This review WILL contain spoilers!In 1982, Sam Brenner and Will Cooper count down the days to when the new video game arcade opens. They enter a video game competition and are up against Eddie Plant, who is a pro at playing Donkey Kong. Meanwhile, NASA sends up a time capsule to outer space with 1980's culture of video games and clips from TV shows as a sign of peace in hopes to make contact with alien life. (This is the Adam Sandler video game version of 'Battleship' 33 years later, Sam Brenner works for a tech company and his best friend, Will is now the President of the United States. The world is soon attacked by video game characters because the aliens took the message the wrong way. They send down Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Mario, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Sam, Will, Eddie, and conspiracy theorist Ludlow must team up and stop the video game aliens from destroying and pixelating the world. This is a cheesy fun ride.

When the going gets tough, the nation has to turn to the nerds as an alien race attacks the Earth with warriors based on old arcade games. A ship was sent out to contact other races in the 1980's, and what was meant as a peace gesture was interpreted as a threat. I found some of Sandler's recent movies not as funny, but to me this one puts him right back in the comedy driver's seat. All the supporting characters are right, including Dinklage as Sandler's old arcade nemesis. Ignore the other reviews and go and enjoy enjoy enjoy.",Pixels
67,blott2319-1,A mess of a movie made by people that don't seem to know anything about video games,2,19 March 2020,"I wanted so badly to be the dissenting opinion on Pixels. I tend to be an apologist for Adam Sandler's movies more than anyone else I know. I also have a great fondness for the days when I would spend hundreds of hours (and probably hundreds of dollars) in the arcade playing things like Pac-Man and Donkey Kong. However, I can't endorse this film, because it is a piece of trash. To be fair, the visual effects are amazing, and I do have to commend them for making the games look so good. I almost found myself caught up in the nostalgia, if it weren't for the fact that it seems no one on the film (aside from the CGI artists) had any knowledge about these games at all. It can look like Donkey Kong all day, but if it doesn't follow any of the rules, then what's the point? I was shocked how this stupid movie doesn't understand the most basic principles of video games, and invents ridiculous contrivances in order to slap together a script that feels like it was never edited after the first draft. They even have a few references to The King of Kong documentary, and yet it seems no one watched that any time recently to get a better understanding of how the game functions, or how arcade tournaments/records work.Even for someone who cares nothing about these classic games, there's nothing worthwhile in Pixels. I'm sure I get a little extra mad at the film because it doesn't pay respect to the games I loved, but it's not like the story makes sense outside of the video game stuff either. The relationships between the characters are not handled well, the hastily thrown together romance is utterly lacking in chemistry, and the humor falls flat every time. I don't expect much from actors like Adam Sandler and Kevin Smith, but even they feel like they are bored or annoyed that they are even in this film. Perhaps Sandler would find some joy in the movie if it all took place in Aruba and he could milk another family vacation out of this film production. Josh Gad is trying so hard to inject some energy into the film, but his character is written so poorly that it comes off like a toddler bouncing around while desperate for attention. And his romantic storyline made me want to put my fist through the screen. Peter Dinklage is also trying, but his character is intended to be a self-important jerk, so it's hard to appreciate the performance. Pixels is a film that looks good, and had a promising premise, but manages to disappoint in every possible way.",Pixels
68,Stephen_A_Abell,Literally Space Invaders... Loved it.,8,5 March 2017,"So here's my guilty little secret - I like Adam Sandler films...Even though he's done some real dross in his career he's brought out a movie or three that has made me laugh out loud, from Airheads back in 1994 and including The Wedding Singer, Little Nicky, Mr Deeds, Eight Crazy Nights, 50 First Dates, The Longest Yard, Bedtime Stories, Funny People, and now Pixels.I love the fact that it makes a parody of the Voyager space probes, which contained golden records containing information about Earth, should an alien race find them... and be able to play them!Now, I was a kid in the 70's and 80's so I remember Arcades and the hours and money spent on Invaders, Asteroids, and Pacman. I could never get the handle of Defender, though. So this movie spoke to me right from the opening shot. So our future hero's are the nerds of their time taking part in a great Arcade Shoot-Out, where it comes down to two players, Eddie, portrayed brilliantly by Peter Dinklage, who gives a nice air of sleaziness to the character and his ""Hard Guy"" voice is great, and Brenner, played by Sandler (who does another great portrayal of Adam Sandler :-) ).Brenner loses and this loss paves the way for his future fate as he never quite gets to become the person he dreamed of in his youth. However, his best friend Will Cooper fares better and is elected as the President of the United States. So when the strange attacks on the Good Ol' US of A cause concern and the heads of security cannot figure out what is happening President Cooper spots something familiar on a video clip and calls in his friend Brenner for help.This is a totally outlandish plot, which the actors, writers, and director do a fantastic job of playing straight and make the comedy about the situations and narrative. The scene where the creator of Pacman meets his ""Sweet Little Boy"" is well thought out and is a perfect example of this.And the scene where Brian Cox's and Sean Bean's characters become ""Extra Close"" made me laugh out loud... very loud... loved it. The director, Chris Columbus, uses all of the actors and each of them gives a good performance to build character and comedic situations. Not one of them feels like they would rather be elsewhere; this makes for a better film. He also keeps the pace going as the action ramps up to the finale.To be honest, I cannot find a single fault with this film. Yes, Adam Sandler's acting dexterity isn't of the highest calibre, but in this film, he tones down the outrageousness of some of his previous movies and it works well within the story and movie, so it's not a drawback here.And since I can relate to the film, as well as it making me laugh a lot and giving me a nice warm and happy feeling, this has now elevated it to the upper ranks of my favourite comedy films.I would recommend this to all, just sit back and let the happy come...",Pixels

71,RforFilm,Adam Sandler and crew waste a potentially funny idea for Pixels that's not worth playing for,2,28 July 2015,"Video games have come a long way since it's mainstream debut in the 1980s. Being born in 1987, I wasn't around long enough to see the classic arcade where games like Pac-Man, Q*bert, and Donkey Kong all created a new form of escapism for the youth. Most people weren't too sure what direction these games would go in. No one knew whether they would evolve into something bigger or if they were a fifteen-minute fad. When companies like Nintendo and Sega brought the games home, it was set that these games were here to stay. When Sony and Microsoft connected these games to the Internet, it seemed that the whole world was playing!In a way, most modern games have become like major motion pictures. I say this as a negative as while many games have long cut scenes that establish a full story, much of the action is with how well you can react and push a button rather then a true challenge. Exceptions include Minecraft and World of Warcraft as your poised to create a character and evolve him like most role-playing games or Modern Warfare and Mario Kart, which relies on playability between other players. A blast from the past puts the world on edge in the latest comedy, Pixels. In 1982, young Sam and Will go to a video game championship where Sam does well as a Pac-Man champion, but looses on Donkey Kong from the egocentric Eddie Plant. The event was recorded and placed in a time capsule that was sent into space, hoping that I would reach intelligent life.Cut to 2015 where Sam (played by Adam Sandler) is working as a home theater installer and Will (played by Kevin James) is now the president of the United States. Both seem board with their lives and hope for more.Aliens attack an army base in Guam that seem to turn everything they touch into pixelated forms. The White House examines the creatures to see that they resemble the characters from Galaga. It seems that the aliens misinterpreted the video games as a declaration of war and are attacking the Earth using those games. Will calls Sam to discuss how to defeat these aliens with his arcade skill. They get Eddie (played by Peter Dinklage) out of jail to join the team to fight They go to London to fight Centipede and New York to fight Pac-Man, yet these aliens seem bent on destroying the world.The idea of Pixels is a good one; a great one that could have been the blockbuster comedy that might have reached Ghostbusters levels. But the big problem starts right at the beginning; you see the Happy Madison Productions logo. This company seems to exist to only give comedian Adam Sandler as much work as possible while putting in as little effort for the comedy as possible. I was hoping that director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter) might spark Sandler into stepping up his comedy. IT DOESN'T!Adam Sandler not only plays the same obnoxious man-child he's been playing for the past ten years, but looks depressed through out the entirety of Pixels. Kevin James adds little to nothing, Peter Dinklage is insultingly wasted (though he gets a few laughs), and the rest of the cast serves to buffer Sandler. Story wise, the pixelated characters attack various cities, but I don't recall one person being hurt. With that, Pixels doesn't seem to care if the humans lived or died. Nothing is at stake and what's gained are women which I find sexist. Worst of all, this is a family movie that is speaking to a kid audience who have no idea who Pac-man or Q*bert are. Why even go after the children when they could have gotten an easy adult audience?I'll give this two ""Game Over"" screens out of ten. I'm declaring Game Over for Adam Sandler who doesn't seem to care about genuine comedy or the usage of a funny idea for a movie. This is a game that's not worth anyone's quarters!",Pixels
72,Hollywood_Yoda,Pixel Perfect,8,18 August 2016,"I was genuinely delighted about how good this film was. Honestly, I was expecting something humorless and stupid. However, it was a crazy, humorous film. It sort of reminded me of a live action version of Wreck it Ralph.Adam Sandler's acting could have been much better, but not his worst either (save that for 1989s Going Overboard). Kevin James wasn't bad as Cooper, the President of the United States. He was genuine.I did think it was great that Sandler included, literally his entire family in the film. But I wondered why his wife didn't play his love interest. Awkward!?The graphics of the film were great too, especially loved the way they used the CGI to make the old 8-bit computer characters. The Pac-man chase was the highlight of the film. And the ending was pretty good too, featuring an array of first generation characters, and Donkey Kong as the final boss battle. I think kids may like the film, but needless to say, watch with an adult as the film is rated PG-13. The younger kids may know a few of the game characters.",Pixels
73,Anurag-Shetty,Brings back fond memories of playing classic arcade games.,8,3 August 2015,"Pixels revolves around four incredibly talented gaming nerds namely, Brenner(Adam Sandler), Cooper(Kevin James), Eddie(Peter Dinklage) & Ludlow(Josh Gad). When these four guys were kids, they took part in the 1982 National Arcade Championship. The footage from this competition & footage of other popular culture, would be sent to outer space by NASA via a space probe, in hopes of communicating with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Unfortunately, the aliens interpret these messages as a declaration of war. They attack Earth in the form of famous arcade video games like, Pac-Man, Centipede, Donkey Kong etc. Now, it is up to Brenner, Cooper, Eddie & Ludlow along with the help of lieutenant Violet(Michelle Monaghan), to teach the US army how to fend off these alien lifeforms. Together, they must utilize all the knowledge, experience & expertise they have to defeat these classic arcade video games in real life, before they take over the planet. Pixels is an extremely funny & entertaining movie. The special effects of the movie are very unique. CGI has never been portrayed like this on screen, ever before. The makers of the movie have successfully recreated all our favorite video games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong & the rest. The fact that all the video game characters are made of pixels in real life, just like in their respective games, is amazing. The riot of colors during all the battles against the alien invaders is otherworldly. The set pieces where many famous monuments of the world get destroyed are spectacular. The Pac-Man set piece in New York is one of the highlights of the film. The 3D, puts the viewer right in the middle of the action. Chris Columbus successfully helms another family film. A tiny flaw of the movie is that, given all the never before seen, revolutionary visual effects, they could have made an unforgettable movie. However, the generic script makes this movie, mostly forgettable. Don't get me wrong! This movie is hugely entertaining. But, it could have been so much more. Adam Sandler is great as Brenner. Kevin James is awesome as Cooper. Michelle Monaghan is brilliant as Violet. Peter Dinklage is the highlight of the movie as Eddie. Dinklage's character steals the show, in every scene he's in. I just wish he had more screen time. Josh Gad is hysterical as Ludlow. Matt Lintz is impressive as Matty. Brian Cox & Sean Bean are good as Admiral Porter & Corporal Hill(SAS Officer) respectively. Jane Krakowski is effective as First Lady Jane Cooper. Ashley Benson is smoldering as Lady Lisa. Dennis Akiyama is hilarious in his cameo as Professor Iwatani. The supporting characters are effective. So, get ready to feel nostalgic as you see your favorite video game characters come to life on the big screen. Pixels is super fun for the whole family & is worth a watch.",Pixels

75,Carycomic,These guys not only saved the world; they saved my summer!,5,25 July 2015,"First of all; I will make a startling confession. This is the first live-action Adam Sandler film I've gone to see since 1996's BULLETPROOF. It's true! I thought he completely ruined that movie for Damon Wayans! Which is why I've never seen HAPPY GILMORE, BILLY MADISON (the obvious inspirations for the name of his own production company), or any other flick he's been in, this side of HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA.But, just as Will Farrell did for me with ELF, so Sandler has done for me with this salute to the classic video arcade games of the 1980's. And, part of that is due to Sandler et al. recruiting Peter Dinklage as Eddie. The latter, whom I first saw on the shamefully underrated 2005 s.f. series THRESHOLD, co-starred in ELF as a bad-tempered author of children's stories. And, I absolutely loved how he kicked Farrell's elfin butt in that Xmas flick!Well, Mr. Dinklage does the same thing here. Only, in this case, he plays Eddie Plant, the video game equivalent of a pool shark who is shamelessly egotistical. He does whatever it takes to win the game. And, in a way, Sam Brenner (Sandler's character) winds up doing the same thing. More specifcally; having to undergo a show-down with the title character of the one arcade game he could never win as a kid. Donkey Kong!Of course, most of his inspiration comes from the lovely divorced army colonel (played by Michelle Monaghan, whom I've admittedly never heard of before; although I, too, would brush my teeth four times a day for her!) who works for the Defense Department. And, as expected in a somewhat romantic comedy, they get their own personal happy ending. As do Josh Gad (""Ludlow"") and Alice Benson (""Lady Lisa,"" a XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS-type video game).Now, don't get me wrong. Some of the jokes I heard were utter failures at making me laugh. But, the mental picture I got of Mr. Dinklage, Martha Stewart, and Serena Williams made me all but roll on the floor of the theater laughing!Which, alone, is why I find this movie four stars funnier than TRAINWRECK. A film so bitterly disillusioning, as romantic comedies with supposedly sympathetic characters go, that I feared I might not see anything worthy of being called truly comedic, on the silver screen, this summer. But, I was ultimately proved wrong. And, as Brian Cox-- playing Admiral Porter--might say: ""This film blows TRAINWRECK out of the water!""",Pixels

77,stevelomas-69401,A visual atrocity. This film is in insult.,3,6 October 2018,It didn't even manage to hold the interest of an 11yr old boy. There are no redeeming features at all.,Pixels
78,billygoat1071,An Unwanted Relic,5,28 August 2015,"Pixels is getting a lot of gripe either because it's an Adam Sandler movie or it apparently rips off a Futurama episode. But putting those complains aside, this movie is designed to be nostalgic to the times when we admire these classic arcade games. But it's tough having that kind of magic since, as most people were right, Sandler's humor and clichés keep getting in the way. There is some fun ideas that the film could have explored more often than the standard tropes of its star, but for some reason, it's impossible. While Pacman and Donkey Kong are truly timeless, Sandler just keeps beating the dead horse of his glory days. The best part of the entire movie is the opening, where we see the childhood of the main characters spend their time at the arcade. It shows the culture where videogames impact the lives of these kids until they grow up. And then, the world has gotten weird at the present day. Aside the fact that one of the kids is now the President of the United States, the movie finally sticks to the collection of Adam Sandler movie clichés. Even though the aesthetics kind of established something larger-than-life here and there, the movie rather focuses on how Sam Brenner tries to hook up with the pretty girl he just met and his unexciting life as an adult. When the aliens invade, there is some colors to be appealed for, but again, the focus is subdued by a number of subplots from each of its main characters.And that's the serious problem of the film; of course it's a comedy that doesn't need to take itself seriously and prioritize more on the laughs, but the humor is clearly not as inspired as it wants to be. We're still being pushed to this romantic subplot that isn't really that interesting, also Brenner and his gang are being degraded for being nerds even though they act more like downright weirdos. These bits are hardly worth rooting for. When it comes to the main plot itself, it's often illogical, but it doesn't quite matter. But the best punchline through that nonsense is when one of the players used cheat codes in the aliens' game IN REAL LIFE. It indicates that even the screenwriters have no idea how these work and it's funny because they just throw it in idiotically without this ""self-aware"" reaction, like what they did to Q- Bert in the end.The action is quite impressive at least. The special effects bring a lot of energy and visual candy on screen. It's pretty cool seeing these games come to life with this scale and cause mayhem whatever place they stumble in. But again, the camera just can't move away from the characters. The acting isn't really that special, even when they're trying. Adam Sandler is still the lazy Sandler we see, no matter how many times he is claimed as a nerd. Michelle Monaghan is unable to shine due that her role is written as a cliché. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage have the enthusiasm, even if the script is supposed to make them obnoxious, but they are the sole charm among these main characters.Pixels is far from Sandler's worst; we could spare it for the impressive craft, entertaining ideas and some rare jokes that work which are intentional and otherwise. But overall, nobody wants to see this type of movie anymore. It could have worked if it was made in the last decade or two, when the actor is still not getting much heat from the audience yet. This movie seeks for nostalgia, but the nostalgia we'd rather see is the classic games than Sandler's old tricks. And it's quite sad that the filmmakers did try to build something crazier in this world; there are aliens and a robot in this movie! But it keeps moving away to the least interesting parts. That side only gets interesting when the screenwriters got things wrong, like the fact that the heroes fight better than the military only because they grew up with the games or, again, the cheat codes. There's an opportunity of fun hinted along the sides, but again, Sandler's fingerprints are too inevitable.",Pixels

Sure some movies have overall childish humour and such but i always have a good time with them, usually watch them when i am drunk too cause its like that i will appreciate them more.When it comes to Pixels, the games represented are from the era before i started playing video games (pretty much before i was born), i do know them and played them a bit later but they where not my childhood games as my first console was an NES. Despite this i could really enjoy seeing those very old games on the big screen and seeing the characters in them.Obviously you have to suspend your disbelief on some aspects like Kevin James as President but this movie is about old video characters attacking the world so duh...This is the kind of movie where you buckle your seat belt, have a few drinks and watch for the laugh and thats about it.

82,LloydBayer,Pixels is packed with vibrant visuals and nostalgic charm that offsets slouchy Sandler and his awkward humor.,6,22 July 2015,"Nostalgia is a powerful emotion but also the only word that can entirely describe Pixels - a sci-fi adventure masquerading as a comedy. While this film has every reason to fail as a comedy, it can still appeal to a specific audience - kids of the 80s, and the current generation of pre-teens yet to discover the trappings of social media.That's a generation gap of 30 years, but the defining moment that bridges this gap is the mutual love for video games. Back in the day, the social norm was to get out of the house, walk to the arcade, spend a few hours with real friends, and vie for social standing as a champion gamer. It felt real with moments that bring back joyous memories that not even a thousand friends on Facebook can match today. On the flip side, gamers are still typecast as nerds, and this is what the film attempts to say. It's 1982 and gaming prodigy Sam has a shot at the Guinness Book championship title. Backed by his gaming chums Will and Ludlow, Sam reaches the finals in a faceoff against narcissist nemesis Eddie 'The Fire Blaster'. Also present is NASA who records the competition and sends it into space to contact alien life. Wrong move. Cut to present day and Will (Kevin James) is the President of the USA (there's hope for gamers?) while Sam (Adam Sandler) and Ludlow (Josh Gad) are everyday losers. Turns out, those aliens did get the message but misinterpreted it as a hostile invitation. Who do you call? Ghostbusters zapping aliens pretty much sums up the rest of the film. While the story gets dumber by the minute (inclusive of the clichéd romance between Sandler's Mr. Fixit and Michelle Monaghan's White House official), director Chris Columbus alternates flat gags with solid visuals and iconic characters that wreak havoc on screen. Add to that some madcap moments from Peter Dinklage as the aforementioned narcissist, Gad let loose ala Jonah Hill style from the Jump Street films, and a list of clever cameos, and there's enough reason for Pixels to generate some offbeat excitement.The fact that Sandler is still pigeonholed as a sad-sack from his Happy Madison Productions (from Happy Gilmore to last year's The Cobbler) can be a typical letdown for many viewers and fans alike. It's the same reason why most of the amusement comes from the supporting cast. Even as they deliver with acceptable comic timing, the real fun is in racing back to the days of Atari or annihilating monsters at the gaming arcade. And speaking of nostalgia, look no further than Columbus, the writing genius behind all time classics like The Goonies and Gremlins - films that are as iconic as the Pac-Man and Donkey Kong games. Kids who watched those films or played those games are grownups today but for the most part, Pixels made me feel as invincible as a kid in an arcade. Game on dude!",Pixels

I mean, what is up with people? Is it because Adam Sandler is in it, and people expect it to be bad? Is it too unrealistic? What's the stupid reason for the low rating?The idea is pretty original. The effects are pretty much top notch. The acting is satisfactory. The humor is alright, nothing too advanced though.Pixels is actually of a pretty rare breed. It is a high budget, comedy/action/sci-fi disaster-movie. Maybe that's why people don't like it, it doesn't fit comfortably in one genre.Anyhow, I enjoyed it. It's not quite great, but good. I got a little bit of that late 90's - early 2000's feeling, which I love. The effects look really good. It has a couple of quite exciting scenes. I didn't find it super funny, but it has a light, nice atmosphere. The acting is pretty much like expected, but Kevin James stands out, and does a great job.It doesn't have a lot of tension, but it being a feel good disaster movie, it doesn't matter much.Don't take it so damn seriously, just let yourself be entertained, and you'll probably like it.",Pixels
84,James_De_Bello,3.5/10,3,29 July 2015,"Dull, boring, stupid, unfunny and worst of all offensive. This movie made me angry at how bad it was and it is incredible to think it was given to us by the same director of the first two Potter movies, which are by all means, in my opinion, two gems.Pixels is the nail in the coffin for any redemption Adam Sandler could have possibly had at this point in his career. I mean, I get it when you're not caring with your stupid hang out movies like Grown Ups, where the whole point is for you to have a paid vacation with your friends, but this? You manage to screw up a film that has this potential? How the hell do you do that?! Characters that are boring, underdeveloped, uninteresting thrown into situations that are clichéd to the point of exhaustion. The whole set up was probably directed by a machine. The further it goes on the further the characters get boring and so does everything around them. There were clue moments in this movie of action that should have been the climax moment were I was close to falling asleep. I cannot stress it enough: this film is BORING! Yet it gets worse: it isn't even funny! I laughed exactly zero times, maybe, maybe I smiled twice. The lengths to which the jokes are stupid, unremarkable, disgustingly delivered is baffling. I am not stupid Adam you know mother effer! I want to be treated nicely and respected when I go to the theater, instead you serve me with insults to my intelligence and a performance that is the pinnacle of you cashing it in. The script is a lazy mess probably put together in a weekend and is more misogynistic than some 40s movies, wow you truly found a way for people to hate you guys! Fortunately, for the love of god, the film has Peter Dinklage in a few scenes where he shows great comedic timing. Moreover Cubert steals any show that there ever was to steal and is legitimately a good part of the film. Finally, as much as I was about to collapse sleeping once every five minutes, the visual effects kept coming back and keeping me awake, because even if they weren't interesting in the story, they did stand out as truly amazing special effects, some of the best I've seen recently and there wasn't a single time I could make them out to be CGI.That isn't enough to save a disaster of a film, if you were on the edge of deciding whether to see this or not I'l tell you: don't go give your money to Sandler he doesn't deserve it, nor does Sony and their recent line of work of which everything wrong with shines here.",Pixels

Can't be forgotten games are shoehorned into a 'can be forgotten' movie.Madison's been trying hard, and no matter how awesome Sandler is in person, his films simply suck. So the production company comes with another one, with Chris Columbus in the vanguard – Pixels. But even Columbus fails to elevate the trodden.This movie is another big fiasco in the long list of fiascos by Happy Madison. Not only Pixels isn't funny, but it is also dumb on so many levels. There are maximum 4-5 places in the entire movie where you might actually laugh. There you go! Counted them on fingers.So they tried putting some melodrama to it, and it looked so unnatural and stupid that you wish why bother? The concept was pretty stupid for a sci-fi flick. The plot had nothing to offer. Don't even get me started on the screenplay.It does light you up with reminiscence if you have lived the Arcade gaming era. All those games did bring a smile of nostalgia to my face.

86,TheHonestCritic,"We have a brilliant concept for this film storyline. But, does Adam Sandler's involvement ruin it?",4,18 July 2021,"""Pixels"" (2015), I remember when I first saw the teaser for this ""movie"", when I watched it, I was immediately intrigued. It looked like a funny and very creative concept. Seriously, extraterrestrials misinterpreted as video game characters attacking Earth in a declaration of war, using technology that was inspired by various video games. Doesn't that just scream excitement? Then, I saw the studios behind it all, Sony Pictures and Happy Madison. Plus, Adam Sandler was part of the cast. Alarms went off in my head right away. Now, I'm not saying I hate Adam Sandler as an actor and film maker overall, he has been involved with a few good and some great movies in his career. But, a handful of them are utter trash. Even after I saw Adam Sandler was in the cast, I still wanted to see this ""movie"". I planned on going to see it in a theater, but several things came up in my life and I didn't get a chance to go see it during it's theatrical release, thank God for that! Soon after it's release on DVD, I saw that it was going to be on TV one night. So, I watched it, since it was 100% free at that time. Let me just say this, you guys. This is one of the most poorly executed films I have ever seen. ""Pixels"" has a cliched and boring storyline, standard to horrible acting, and a predictably generic soundtrack to try and tie it all together. As I mentioned before, the plot for this ""film"" is a very clever concept. Aliens recreated as evil versions of video game characters invade Earth? That was a fun and unique storyline practically gift-wrapped for the writers and film makers! But, apparently they got morons involved and none of the brilliant opportunities were taken advantage of at all. Adam Sandler's production company, Happy Madison, has ruined yet another cool idea, again! This is really starting to aggravate me. ""Pixels"" is stuffed to the brim with cliche after cliche, dull and boring dialogue, uninspired action scenes and a lack of creativity with the villains. There are so many awesome video games out there that they could have used for this ""film"". Sadly, they chose a few of probably the most boring ones in arcade game history. The only one out of this group that I actually like, is Pac-Man. Why? Because everyone, including me, can look at that character and know where it's from, whether you've played that game or not. Overall, the plot was poorly executed, next to nothing of interest happens and the script sounds like it was written by people on drugs. Probably the saddest thing is, that it didn't have to suck. It could've been, and should've been so much more. I honestly could've wrote a better script in less than two hours! As far as the acting goes, it's just as big a letdown. The only actors that seem to be trying here are: Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean. Their acting was not too bad. Unfortunately, the rest of the cast was just plain mediocre, especially Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad. To give Adam Sandler some credit, he's not a bad actor overall in his career. But, Kevin James and Josh Gad are not funny, nor will they ever be funny in any form of media. Why do those two keep getting cast in films and TV shows? The acting is just a joke from the majority of the cast! As far as the soundtrack goes, it's a big disappointment. When I saw who composed this ""film"" score, I was very surprised. Henry Jackman wrote the music! Usually, he writes decent music for any movie he gets involved in. What happened to him here? Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of filth. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a nice atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, all of them are well-done and still hold up to this day. Yes, they do get a little cheesy, but that was the intent, since the villains are classic video game characters. ""Pixels"" is yet another letdown in the world of Adam Sandler movies. One thing I loathe in the film and animation industry is wasted potential. This ""movie"" is the epitome of wasted potential, they had a phenomenal concept and yet they somehow screwed it up. I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this ""film""? Unless you're a fan of the video games that this ""movie"" is based on, you'd be much better off skipping it. To tell you the truth, I have more fun playing the video games instead!",Pixels

In the late 80's he was a gaming phenomenon, but was out- championed by a cocky kid (later played by the almighty Peter Dinklage). Nowadays, he's a wash out, with no real aim in life. Lucky for him then, that aliens start attacking earth in the form of video games. Video feeds of retro arcade games were sent in to outer space as a peace offering, not a admission of war. Sandler, his geeky friend Josh Gad and nemesis Peter Dinklage are the ones leading the defense. Just as unconvincing is the world relying on three gaming wizards. The acting hits all sorts of levels from mediocre (Sandler), to good (Dinklage, Monaghan), to over the top (Gad).

Although it isn't really that original, (let's be honest. It's ""Ghostbusters"" but with video games) it's still well done. The ending was a bit silly, and felt rushed and du-ex-machina, but up until that point I thought it was great. It is a bit slow in some parts and I wanted it to get back into the action, especially because those parts have no effect on the plot whatsoever. They tried to set up a romantic relationship between two characters, but it's wasted because they don't end up together anyway. And since Sean Bean is in the movie I felt they missed an oppurtunity to make a joke about how he always dies. They could have had him in an arcade where he gets a game over screen, and then had him say ""Why do I always die?"" Missed oppurtunity. I did enjoy the countless 80's pop culture references, and those were the best part of the movie.

90,ginocox-206-336968,"Better than expected, but my expectations were extremely modest",6,7 November 2015,"""Pixels"" is exponentially better than expected, judging from the poster art and synopsis and having never seen the trailer. My expectations were so abysmally low that I felt compelled to watch a few minutes to satisfy my curiosity as to what they could possibly have been thinking. While it falls short of what I would consider a good movie that I would want to watch again to catch any subtle nuances, it has a few funny moments, the CGI animation is top-notch and it has a couple of amusing cameos. The film is infantile, schmaltzy and corny. Sandler's Brenner doesn't seem to grow, mature or develop much. Having risen to heroic stature to save humanity, he seems content to return to his life of mediocrity. We are left with a puerile fantasy fulfillment story with no moral that seems instead to pander to the self-indulgent mentality of adolescent video game addicts. As with many comedies, the romantic B stories also fail to rise above the level of adolescent wish fulfillment. The aliens seem contrived and inconsistent. They are smart enough to master intergalactic travel, but foolish enough to interpret a sort of travelogue film as a declaration of war. Q*bert indicates they were a happy planet until they received the message from earth, but they claim to have already destroyed many planets. When we do catch a glimpse of the aliens, in the guise of Q*bert, Max Headroom or Lady Lisa, they either join forces with the arcaders or inexplicably give them a second chance. ""12 Rounds,"" ""Predator,"" ""Saw"" and dozens of other films have antagonists who manage to engage the protagonist in twisted games much more convincingly. The movie goes to considerable lengths to make its characters unique, complex and multi-dimensional, but the aliens are generic 1950s B- movie aliens with twenty-first century weaponry. In the end, their departure is as unmotivated as their journey to our galaxy. We should also have seen Sinnamon. Her presence could have amped the stakes in the B story and provided fodder for jokes. The film is much better than I would have expected and has a few laugh-out-loud moments but never rises above the level of mindless entertainment.",Pixels
91,rollernerd,It's On Like Donkey Kong!,5,25 October 2020,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's long grand final weekend movie review is the comedy Pixels (2015) where after an attempted communication during an arcade tournament in the 80s, aliens invade Earth after intercepting video feeds of the classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war. The aliens use the games as models including your Atari and Nintendo favorites Pacman, Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, Galaga and Centipede. Yep that's right, these are the games I was exposed to before hitting up Tekken and Sonic the Hedgehog on other platforms.Back to the movie, in order to defeat the aliens and save the planet the president of the United States, played by Kevin James...who actually does well, calls his best mate who knock knock knock...it's the Sandman who's character Sam came second in the arcade championship back in the 80s and is now a home-theatre installer. The Sandman along with James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage lead the team of old-school arcade players to fight back against the aliens.This movie's special effects were pretty good along with the laughs in particular Gad with his conspiracy ridden room and his love interest for the Lady. Kevin James as the president was hysterical especially when he doesn't understand the U.K. Prime Minister played by Fiona Shaw (for you Three Men and a Little Lady fans). The Pac Man scene was good with the mini coopers plus the final Donkey Kong battle was great too. And the Lady Lisa throwback was awesome!! Great reference to an underrated video game character. And the actor playing her...oh my wow!!What let this film down was the supporting cash, like why have 30 Rock alum Jane Krakowski as the First Lady when we hardly see her talk?? And Peter Dinklage...what is with his accent? He was cool as but his accent along crude jokes didn't fit the family friendly tone. Having said that Dinklage along with James had the best moments in this flick. However, the jokes do get painfully unfunny and unoriginal and just add stuff that isn't creative including Dan Aykroyd's vodka brand and an ongoing threesome joke. Overall, 5.6/10",Pixels
92,jmoneyjohal,"An absurd story ,but Pixels is still very enjoyable just leave your brains at home.",6,24 July 2015,"Now when one walks into a Adam Sandler movie if your are excepting a comedy classic especially after seeing his last couple of films, then you are done right crazy. Pixels however isn't as bad as his last couple, but its far from his best work.Pixels when it comes to story, or screenplay its down right absurd.The film is full of loopholes at every corner. Please throw your sensibilities out of the window when watching the film. For example Kevin James is playing the president of America, if you feel my drift.While the script did need some work on, Pixels at the end of the day is still pretty enjoyable. Its full of good comedy, the VFX is great, and if you grew up in the 90s or 80s seeing characters of Donkey Kong, Pacman on screen bring back sweet some nostalgia.Story wise the film is pretty much about 3 nerd gamers saving the world from alien invaders, who are sending video game characters to destroy the world..... Yeah like i mentioned earlier the story is ABSURD.Acting wise Adam Sandler, Kevin James,Peter Dinklage, and Josh Gad act well in there comic avatar.Overall this is the perfect leave your brains at home and just enjoy type of film. If your looking even for a outa of sensibilities in this film don't watch it!!! If you don't like video games, do not watch also. For the rest enjoy.Dir Chris Columbus has had better films but this one is definitely not as bad as some critic made it out to be.3/5* or 6/10",Pixels
93,Thrashman88,Loads of fun!,9,30 August 2015,"Naysayer's beware: If you don't like Adam Sandler and/or 80's cultural references, you are NOT going to like PIXELS. Is this movie masterpiece theater? Far from it. Will it win best picture at the Academy Awards? Highly unlikely. Will it enthrall 40 year olds who grew up with arcade games? Chances are, most will. I just stepped out of the theater and I must confess I enjoyed PIXELS very, very much, despite reading the god awful reviews by ""film critics"" as well as pimp faced IMDb readers. I agree that Adam Sandler's fortunes at the box office have been on a down slide for some years now but then again, he was never that ""big"" of a draw, like say, Eddie Murphy in his prime. I guess if you try to over analyze any of Sandler's films you're going to wind up seriously depressed. PIXELS is big, dumb fun, full of 80's references (the arcade games, the music, hell, even MTV!). I won't describe the movie because other users have done eloquently so. I'll just stick with my very positive praises for this movie. My daughters, who have nothing to do with 80's culture, both enjoyed the movie a whole lot. True, my kids know most of the games that appear in the movie and see them come to life and interact with real characters was a roller-coaster ride. There's Pacman, Defender, Frogger, Q- Bert, Galaga, Asteroids, Space Invaders and of course, Donkey Kong. Certainly the over 40 crowd out there will enjoy it, but young kids will too.Plus, as a GAME OF THRONES fan, it was a rush seeing Sean Bean and Peter Dinklage in here, and having CHEAP TRICK kicking off the movie is always good in my book!I'm buying this on bluray as soon as it comes out!",Pixels

95,Olicosmic,An amazing idea ruined by an awful script,3,5 July 2018,"This movie is one of the most disappointing movies of 2015, as the trailers made it seem like it was gonna be an amazing nostalgia filled time. But instead, it's just another really bad Adam Sandler movie. Look, it's definitely not the worst he's done, but it's nothing good whatsoever. The idea behind this film is straight up genius, as alien signals are sent with video game files, and then the aliens send back the video game characters. That's awesome, but this movie just straight up ruins it in almost every way. One, the script is just awful. This is because nothing is really funny, there are extremely large plot holes, and it's just uninspired and subpar at best. Two, the only enjoyable performance done was by Peter Dinklage. He was awesome, but everyone else was just not funny and kind of half hearted. Kevin James does the same exact thing he does in every other movie he's in, Adam Sandler looks uninterested most of the time, Michelle Monoghan comes off as non believable at times, Josh Gad yells a lot and isn't that interesting, etc. Overall, almost nobody really gave it their all, which doesn't surprise me considering how poorly written everything is, so I don't blame them for this. I mean, besides this movie, everyone in this film were great in other films. Three, as a comedy, this movie fails miserably, as it's just not funny. I'm sorry, but I don't find Kevin James as the freaking president or Josh Gad screaming for little to no reason that funny. I guess I chuckled a tiny bit, but once the novelty wore off, it just became painful to sit through as jokes never really landed. However, like I said, Peter Dinklage was awesome, but that's about it. Overall, I really did not like this movie at all. I know there are people that like this film, because I've read the reviews, and while I'm glad that they enjoyed it, I just can't. I wanted to love this movie, as the idea for this film is one of the best I've seen. It just feels like after the idea was conceived, little to no effort was put into making this film a great one, which really sucks. There are a few things I did like that keeps this a tiny bit better than other Adam Sandler films in my opinion (for whatever that's worth). The idea, like I said previously, is great, and the visuals are amazing and they look great. I guess the performances aren't that bad. Sure, they're not quite as believable or funny as they should be, but they are passable, I guess. Besides that, there is little I can recommend about this movie. It's just another crappy Adam Sandler movie, and I hate saying that, because I really thought this movie looked really cool. But, alas, this is just an amazing idea ruined by an awful script.",Pixels
96,supermaggie,Could have been much better,4,28 May 2016,"The film starts well with a fun look back to the 80s, and then immediately makes its first mistake. Hollywood never learns, using a cookie-cutter approach by implementing a coerced, annoying, unnecessary, implausible love story between Sandler and Monaghan, and later (Spoiler alert) an even more ridiculous one with ""Ludlow"" and ""Lady Lisa"", who (unfortunately even at the expense of QBert) miraculously falls in love with him and therefore opposes her makers ... downright laughable, unnecessary, coarse, boring, this is a movie about old video games, no romantic comedy!!!!!! The generous four points are merely for the battle against Centipede, the one against Pacman and for casting Sean Bean and Ashley Benson (albeit her unworthy role). In short, the film could have been great, if the makers had been concentrating on the core story, but when Sandler and James notwithstanding the premise do their usual BS, the bottom line is only disappointment.",Pixels

Definitely appeals to those of a certain age, but I think kids would enjoy it too. The only negative for me is some of the flashing on screen bothers me and I fast forwarded, but there wasn't too much of it. So, in summary, a fun movie, 6/10.",Pixels
98,CleveMan66,"""Pixels"" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time!",9,24 July 2015,"When I first read about the premise of the movie ""Pixels"" (PG-13, 1:45) – early 1980s video arcade games coming ""to life"" and attacking the earth – I thought that it was a really original and fun idea. The feature film is based on an award-winning 2010 French short film of the same name, which simply shows some of these 8-bit game images and characters emanating from an old television set and turning objects and buildings into pixelated versions of themselves. (The short film is only about 2 ½ minutes long and is available on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUnyUrA34bQ.) I felt that expanding this simple idea into a feature-length science fiction action comedy was brilliant and held a lot of potential. Then I learned that the movie starred Adam Sandler and Kevin James whose last few films haven't exactly been their best. Yet, I still hoped that this movie would signal a return to form for those two talented and accomplished comic actors and also that the filmmakers wouldn't screw up what could be a very cool movie. So, was my optimism justified? In my opinion, yes! That's right, folks. It is, of course, my opinion (although not ""just"" mine, as I'll explain later), but I really think that this is one of those times to ignore the professional critics and listen to a fellow Movie Fan. ""Pixels"" is terrific! Sandler is Sam Brenner, an erstwhile nationally-ranked arcade gamer who hasn't done much with his life since his success in the first National Arcade Game Championship in 1982. He now works for ""Nerd Brigade"" (a fictionalized version of companies like ""Geek Squad"") and he still hangs out with Will Cooper (James), his best friend from back in the day. (Although it's revealed very early in the film, I won't tell you what Will does for a living in the present because finding out is a real hoot!) When earth comes under alien attack (meaning alien, as in outer space – don't be frightened, Mr. Trump), in order to save the world as only they can, Sam and Will reunite with other former ""arcaders"", Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad), who ""lacks the social skills"" and is obsessed with conspiracy theories, along with Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage), who is over-the-top arrogant and of questionable moral fiber.Video footage from that 1982 competition was put in a time capsule and sent into space where it was discovered by an alien race and misinterpreted. The unnamed aliens took the tape as a challenge to do the galactic equivalent of ""racing for pinks"". This other planet sends giant versions of our classic arcade games to fight earthlings in a series of battles, with the first planet to get to ""game over"" three times taking the other's planet as a prize. With the support of the President (and to the dismay of military leaders played by Brian Cox and Sean Bean), Sam and company link up with weapons designer Lt. Colonel Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to fight high energy light with high energy light.As the attacks unfold, the pixels (actually, voxels, because they're presented as three-dimensional cubes and the film is in 3-D) take the form of a different classic arcade game each time, announce their next attack via re-dubbed versions of early 1980s news and entertainment video clips, and commence to pixelate everything from ordinary objects to famous buildings to people, which is how they capture humans and transport them to their spaceship as war trophies.""Pixels"" both is and isn't your typical Adam Sandler movie. It's more high concept than most of his other Happy Madison Productions, but has typical Sandler-esque elements such as his character's friendship with a young boy and budding romance with a beautiful woman, plenty of 1980s music (including one of those songs amusingly sung on stage by one of the film's characters) and cultural references from that decade, some of his usual crew in the cast (although not as many as usual), a few well-done celebrity cameos and a moral of the story which includes underdogs making good and rising above their personal histories. There's some juvenile humor, but this script features better jokes than most of Sandler's recent comedies, while the sure hand of director Chris Columbus (director of two ""Home Alone"" movies, two ""Harry Potter"" movies and many others) maintains great pacing and keeps things very entertaining.The special effects are crude, but that's by design since the attackers take the form of decades old video game characters, which don't have nearly as many pixels as those in today's games. However, the filmmakers cleverly use the rules of those old games to drive the movie's plot. Those who remember the 80s will appreciate this film the most, but it also appeals to those born long after The Me Decade ended, as I observed in the reactions of my fellow theater patrons and as a young lady and young man (15 and 16-years-old, respectively) with whom I spoke after the movie confirmed. Better than previous 80s video game movie adaptations like ""Tron"", ""Pixels"" is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time! And isn't that what going to the theater is all about? This is a movie that ISN'T supposed to be realistic and IS supposed to be silly and fun. Lighten up, critics. As this review ends, the pixels on my computer screen form the letter ""A"".",Pixels

On a traditional (and reassuring) narrative pattern Authors built a film which is, under many aspects, innovative.The idea is funny (credits should be given to French artist Patrick Jean and his 2012 short 'Pixels' for inspiration and further graphic development). The moral message is relaxing (being awkward doesn't mean that you can't be President of the United States, at least as long as you'll stay close to your loser friends).

100,pinkarray,The video game characters are evil?,4,3 November 2015,"This was a boring movie from the start. The only good things is some of the action helped liven it up and there were some witty moments. I liked the questions Adam Sandler asked but the tension of this film just falls apart. It was quite unrealistic, I mean, how would Adam escape Pac-man by jumping off a roof? He would've got hurt. And I also didn't like the ideas the characters came up with to avoid the video game characters. Like pretending to be the man who doesn't want to die? That's pretty obvious!But almost the whole movie is boring and made me want to fall asleep. There was sappy romance towards the end. The acting and dancing was weird. I thought that the man singing was good in that one scene.I think that there was too much talk about video games in this movie, I know this is a video game movie like Wreck-it Ralph but the special effects to this movie were also weird.This was quite a disappointment. I thought Wreck-it Ralph was better. Both movies are not so bad for children but I recommend to go watch Wreck-it Ralph instead. A lot of things were executed way better as well as the animation and acting and they were not painfully annoying.",Pixels
101,ctowyi,A One Trick Pony and a Lazy One at That,4,13 August 2015,"Pixels has to be Adam Sandler's best movie in years. But please hold your horses because this still pretty much sucks. The trailer more or less tells you what this is about - When aliens misinterpret video feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war, they attack the Earth in the form of the video games.That's not a bad idea, actually it sounds like great idea, but Pixels is a one trick pony. The story never tries to take the simple premise one step further and it expects to coast along with the nostalgia generated by these larger than life arcade 'monsters'. I think they have forgotten that everybody who was into these games have grown a lot older. There are some hilarious bits but I just couldn't laugh (likewise with the rest of the pitiful number of heads in the cinema on a Thursday afternoon). One of the reasons is the insipid and lazy script that basically broad-strokes every character into just one identifiable trait, and for the umpteenth time Sandler is the gentle man-child who will win the day and get the girl. It is the same old lazy talking pattern and acting screaming at the world that losers will be winners and shite on the world who thinks otherwise. Do something else man! The script also didn't do the film any favors. Tell me if this makes any sense - ""you smell like the Book of Genesis"".The only sequence I like is the Pacman one and the only character I dug is Dinklage in a mullet hamming it up, but he couldn't save the movie for me. The only way this movie would work is for the studios to put the film in a time capsule, place it in a time machine and make it go back to the 1980s. The audience then will definitely lap it up. That's where it deserves to be, but that would mean they have to delete that Obama joke.",Pixels
102,kenyae-cagle,Eh.,5,6 August 2015,"The movie was enjoyable on a fantasy stand point. I thought the movie would have been so much more awesome, but the fact that one of the characters fell in love with a video game character and she fell back in love with him with a few words was a cliché. That doesn't make too much sense since she is a digital program and should not be able to develop feelings. I feel that the movie gave me more of a fantasy of wishing video game characters did come to life, not to attack us but to definitely go against them for regular fun. I did dislike the fact that they didn't even include super Mario as an enemy or a boss to go against that would have maybe enjoy this movie a lot more. I also, didn't appreciate the fact that this movie totally made a punk out of Qbert and made him basically a damsel in distress. The best part of the movie was obviously the Pac Man part. The finale with Donkey Kong was good also, but in total the movie had some funny parts and could have used a better pulling story to actually have the crowd more into the film.",Pixels
103,stephendaxter,"Fun video-game scenes but seriously, Adam Sandler, why?",4,27 September 2015,"Pixels, a film that when i first heard of it i thought had a really great premise, seriously, classic video-games coming down to attack earth and the only way to defeat them is by playing by the rules of the game. On paper that sounds like a very fun and entertaining time, but then you add Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and a boring story and you get this barely watchable garbage with very few redeemable qualities. My main hope for this film was that Adam Sandler would not be playing a dumb character who speaks with stupid voices, yells, tells shitty jokes and that he would just play a more laid back character who can still be funny on occasion. But although he isn't as bad as he has been in recent years he is still the low point of this film and drags it down, like, a lot. I don't think i need to spell it out for you that Sandler has had a serious problem finding a good film since 2006's 'Click'. So i really shouldn't be surprised at the fact that this isn't a return to form, but Sandler at his best is hilarious so i will keep hoping that one day we will get a good Sandler comedy, unfortunately, this is far from it.Now, the story in this film is just so dumb and cheesy and really doesn't have much substance to it at all. The film is literally a few video-game battles scattered throughout with a whole bunch of side-plots and jokes in-between. But when literally 95% of those side-plots are crap and you don't care about them it makes those scenes drag on and on. You have the obligatory romance that totally does not fit into the film at all and is a bunch of forced, completely out of place pile of crap that offers nothing more that cheap running jokes and filler to add to that run-time. Seriously, not a major plot spoiler here but be warned, (all in the first 20 minutes or so) a kid calls Sandler to install a T.V then he meets the kids mother, recently divorced, they talk, and then she happens to be a DARPA agent going to the same place as Sandler and then happens to for some reason be the person assigned to work closely with Sandler for the remainder of the movie. Did they even try? Some of the characters/performances were OK at best, Peter Dinklage wasn't great but he was kinda bearable, Josh Gad was probably the best in the film and that isn't saying much. But the scenes with them at least kept me awake, if i had to sit there watching Sandler and Kevin James the whole time i'd have zoned out really quickly. Sorry, did i say Kevin James? I meant PRESIDENT Kevin James...... whose dumb-ass idea was that, imagine a world where Paul Blart is the president, yeh, i know it's dumb. When was the last time Kevin James was actually funny, i can't watch this guy anymore and he is heading down the same track as Sandler, if he isn't there already. His character served no purpose other than crappy jokes and an excuse to have Sandler's character at every place at the right time. And they even dragged Brian Cox and Sean Bean into this film, why they agreed i will never know. So, what did i like? I actually found the video-game battles to be somewhat enjoyable, some more than others. Just seeing these old arcade games come to life in a 3D world actually was quite cool it looked good visually and were the highlights of the film. Sandler didn't bother me much in those scenes because the focus was taken off him for a moment, of course, if you took him out of the scene it still would have been better. Especially the last 10-15 minutes i enjoyed quite a bit, i won't spoil it but it was just fun to watch and got me to laugh for the first and only time. So, in the end, i guess this is a good film for kids who will laugh at anything, and for those people who find Sandler still funny, whoever who are. But if you are looking for a good video- game based film, just watch Wreck-It-Ralph and you won't be disappointed. I would have maybe pushed this film to nearly a 5 but they had to keep that goddamn piece of **** absolutely ******* dumb scene in there with Toru Iwatani so it loses a point. - 4/10",Pixels

I found the idea funny, but Chris Columbus' final execution of the plot leaves a lot left to ask for. While ""Pixels"" is fast paced, action packed and entertaining, the overlaying story, consequences of the characters' choices, and the dialog isn't much to be joyful over. The jokes are generally misplaced and comes at inappropriate times. That Sandler makes a lazy performance isn't anything shocking, what's more disappointing is that Monaghan, Gad, and Dinklage seem to have been infected with the before mentioned comedians' lack of commitment to his job. Yes, ""Pixels"" is a colorful ride and the action scenes are thankfully far more than the painful conversations, but if the film was an arcade game, I wouldn't insert one more cent to experience it again.",Pixels

No, this isn't going to be cinematic brilliance but it did turn out to be a fun, enjoyable film.Adam Sandler and Kevin James were dare I say not that bad in this. Josh Gad on the other hand was actually very annoying and idiotic – a role that usually is occupied by Sandler and James.There are a lot of funny moments through out the whole film but there are also some moments where they drag the joke on and on and on until it dies a horrible death. Also the way they portray the British in this film is pretty crap, with stupid, old jokes.As well as an awesome soundtrack, there is also the cast, aside from the above mentioned; Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, Brian Cox, Sean Bean, Jane Krakowski and Dan Aykroyd.An enjoyable, brightly colourful film that I would watch again, maybe even buy when it's in bargain bin or something.CHAPPY THINKS leave all expectations at the cinema doors and just chill out and watch an entertaining, fun movie.",Pixels

It was so cringe worthy and waste of time. Michelle Monaghan was just there to look pretty.The special effects, all the retro characters brought to life, were pretty good. The pix-elation effects looked nice. Also, there were some, very few, scenes which actually were fun. Like defeating donkey Kong while 'We will rock you' is being played.

The jokes never worked, the situations never worked and had so much cringe worthy stuff, and the cheese level was through the roof.Man, I was so looking forward to watching this movie. It had the potential to be so much fun and be really successful.

107,Bravesfan17,Chris Columbus and Adam Sandler Combine Fun With Nostalgia,8,2 August 2015,"Chris Columbus and Adam Sandler are two people in the film industry whose movies I grew up with and still enjoy up to today. Columbus gave us Home Alone, Adventures in Babysitting, and Mrs. Doubtfire. Sandler gave us Happy Gilmore, Mr. Deeds, and Big Daddy. Now, they have combined their efforts to give us a new film that also took me back with Pixels.The film begins with adolescent versions of Sam Brenner and Will Cooper, who are checking out the new video game arcade that just opened. There, they also meet and befriend Ludlow Lamonsoff. They all get involved in a huge video game tournament where footage of all the kids playing video games will be sent into outer space. The finals come down to Sam and another kid named Eddie Plant. Eddie beats Sam in a game of Donkey Kong. Years later, they have all lived different lives. Will (Kevin James) has become President of the United States, while Sam (Adam Sandler) has become a tech installer. Ludlow (Josh Gad) has become a conspiracy theorist. Will has called in Sam to look at some footage he has of a military base in Guam, thinking it might have something to do with a video game they played when they were kids. It turns out that the attackers are an alien race who interpreted the video of kids playing video games as a declaration of war. When the military isn't trained for defending the world against video games, it is up to Sam and Ludlow to save the world before their three lives are up.While Adam Sandler is well know for his low brow, goofy characters, this time around he has toned down the goofiness a lot. There is still a little bit of a goofball, but compared to his fellow cast members, his role is a bit more straight. Kevin James as the adult Will Cooper is also in more of straight part. Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who plays the adult version of Eddie Plant, have the crazy goofball roles in this one. Both Gad and Dinklage are riots in their parts and you can tell they are having a lot of fun with their roles. Veteran character actor Brian Cox is also a lot of fun in his part as a crusty old admiral who is not particularly happy with how the President is handling the crisis at hand. Michelle Monaghan is also decent as Colonel Violet Van Patten, a single mother with a young son who is also called into action during the crisis.Chris Columbus delivers us a fun film with a lot of references to the old video games such as Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and Centipede. Columbus is having a lot of fun with this, mixing in the action and the comedy, and showing that he still has something for us. Now Columbus did have to go to the different companies who made each video game and get permission to use their characters. But with what he was able to get, he certainly shows respect for the characters and still gives the audience something entertaining.The visual effects are outstanding. I like how the visual effects team made all the video game characters look like they came right out of the machine rather than some new, and improved CGI. With this, it feels more in line with the games from the 80's.Pixels is a fun film for everyone. The kids will get some enjoyment and interest in the story and situations, while the adults will get to see some of their favorite video game characters come alive on screen.",Pixels

110,justinwfirestone,Nowhere near as bad as people say,6,31 July 2015,"Pixels was supposed to be the worst movie of the summer (that trailer for Bill Murray's Rock the Kasbah looks colossally worse). It was supposed to be ridiculous, boyish, puerile, lame, stupid, hackish, dumb-dumb-dumb-fooly-foolish.Surprise! It's all of that! And it's awesome. How else can you make such an outlandish plot work unless you totally sell it. Kevin James becomes the President of the United States?! Doesn't Mark Cuban have something to say about that?Maybe it was the opening scenes that drew me in, giving me a strong sense of nostalgia for those ancient days when quarters seemed like gold doubloons because you could put them into a machine at an arcade and shoot down invaders from outer space. I immediately remembered the infamous Sluggo's arcade where 14-year-old kids chain smoked, tugging on joysticks and slapping buttons while their mothers went shopping at the mall. I remembered that time when I was four and all the kids at the bowling alley were watching me set the record on Spy Hunter and I peed my pants because I didn't want to stop chasing fame.It was worth it, of course.What is a pixel? It's a cube of energy. And it's a weapon. We don't understand it, but we can harness its entirety and make nerds pew- pew it. ""Let the nerds take over.""Adam Sandler is just fine in the movie. I normally despise his hammy overacting, but he reels himself in when he could clearly be a joker daddy with some of the scenes. And Kevin James isn't annoying, either!The movie is actually filled with some pretty biting satire of modern politics, modern video games, social media, mass media, and conspiracy theorists. As a young man watches the alien invaders destroy the Taj Mahal, he quickly films it with his cell phone and just as quickly decides it would be better if he could be in it so he turns to get a selfie video. Who wouldn't?There's plenty of good cameos, campy references to the pop culture of the 1980s, and a pretty sick burn of One Tree Hill. And we get a nice break from the action at a cocktail party that has a lot of funny moments.I thought Peter Dinklage would be cringe-worthy as a mulleted dork, but he actually garners some sympathy by the end. Brian Cox and Sean Bean give nice over-the-top performances along the way, too.I liked Pixels.",Pixels

113,rcolgan,"Another Weak Sandler Film, Just With a Bigger Effects Budget",3,8 August 2015,"Video games really don't have a good reputation when it comes to having film adaptations. Sure we have a few good one's like Wreck it Wralph or Scott Pilgrim, but for the most part they seem to go down the same route as the Super Mario Bros movie where the film loses all the charm that made the game enjoyable to begin with. Part of the reason for this is they always seem to be put into dreadful hands. This time those dreadful hands are Happy Madison Productions, Sandler's film studio that have been producing his cinematic turds for 15 years now. And once again they have produced another insulting comedy, lacking any real charm and being light on laughs.The plot unfolds because back in the 80's NASA sent several video games in to space to communicate to extraterrestrials. But their message of peace was misinterpreted as a declaration of war and the aliens send several video game characters to attack the earth. Thus President Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood friend and gaming champion Brenner (Adam Sandler) to fight off the alien invasion.Right away we've really got to suspend disbelief to accept the plot. Not just because of having to accept the poorly explained justification of why the aliens are attacking as video games, but also buying Kevin James as president of the USA. It's never explained how he became President, but unless Donald Trump was the only other candidate there's no way he could've gotten voted into the position. Especially considering he plays the same annoying character he always does of the dumb guy who does nothing but hang out with Adam Sandlers character. None of the other characters are much better. Sandler has as much charisma as a plank of wood. Josh Gad's performance as the nerdy friend is annoying from the start. The only one who gets even a chuckle is Dinklage as the over the top douchey rival, but even that gets worn out quickly. Also just like all Sandler productions we get a lot of offensive stereotypes. This time the focus is on geek stereotypes, like gamers are antisocial weirdo's who have no lives and live in their mothers basement. Albeit this isn't the most offensive stereotype, but it's still insulting one of the film's biggest audiences. Besides this there are other typical offensive representations we see in all Sandler movies, like women being nothing more than eye candy. In fact there are only two female characters in lead roles. The first is Michelle Monaghan who's in the film only to give Sandlers character somebody to flirt with. The other is Ashley Benson who plays one of the video game characters who comes to life, who not only doesn't get a single line of dialogue in the film but also ends up being a literal trophy for one of the characters. Having some of gaming's most recognisable icons, you'd really think the film would actually do something good with them. But it doesn't. The gaming characters will just attack Sandler and co. only for the humans to fight back and that's it. It never tries to actually make any jokes with these characters, but instead does the same thing as a film like Disaster Movie where it will try to get a laugh by just naming something popular. The only video game icon they do anything else with is Q*bert, who is one of their trophies to help them. But all they have him do is typical annoying Sandler humour like watching Q*bert wet himself with pixels and some weak slapstick.Although at least the gaming icons they use actually look good. It's not like the Mario Bro's Movie where Goomba's looked like a pear on the body of Frankenstein and instead the 3d CGI models maintain the charm of the original designs. But to me this makes the film even worse than typical Sandler comedies because it ends up feeling like such wasted potential. Had a better production been given the chance to use these characters, we might have got a charming homage to video games. But instead we got a typical Sandler comedy, just as unfunny as always but with a bigger effects budget.",Pixels

Firstly, there are NO cheat codes on Arcade cabinets like Donkey Kong. I don't know why they made such a stupid plot point like that, but it's not true. Now our new generation will not know this about retro-gaming.Next, the military aren't stupid so that they don't recognize a pattern. One of my good friends was a war-veteran. He said that the army would train them with video games all the time. So the fact that they made the military unable to recognize patterns just to make Sandler look good is idiotic.Third, it's so unreal. How can Sandler's character just have clearance to walk into the White House? Why does he win the heart of the woman he creeped out? Why is Kevin James the President Of the United States? Why are women treated like trophies on this bad movie?Finally, they take a big insult to video games themselves. Toru Iwantani getting his hand bitten off by Pac-Man? I wonder why he agreed to such a humiliating scene? The whole Lady Lisa thing was so annoying. The fact that she was Q-Bert in the end was disgusting and mentioned by Sandler, but why the movie lets this slide is idiotic, Jeff Lee is probably very angry right now.Avoid this movie please, and stop trying to make it seem like a great movie about video games, because it's not.

120,valen060,Underrated Sandler and Friends Battle 80s Video Game Icons,7,24 July 2015,"Among the many scathing reviews critics have written regarding Adam Sandler films over the years, I'd say it's best to ignore them for once as this movie one-ups the dullness left behind by recent duds Grown Ups 2 and Mall Cop 2 combined. Speaking of the latter, seeing Paul Blart become President felt more like a barrel of laughs that I could never take my mind off of. Back to my review, the film starring Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, Peter Dinklage, and Michelle Monaghan was certainly impressive with its visuals though with a story that looked too simple to write. Director Chris Columbus himself has had a string of hits (Home Alone, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and misses (Rent), but I'd say this one in particular has some significance and is more like a teeter-totter between thrills and monotony.Adam Sandler portrays washed-up 80s avid gamer Sam Brenner who now works as a software installer, but when he's summoned by his old friend-turned-President Will Cooper, he and fellow former 80s gamers must ally together to stop an alien threat taking on the form of familiar video game characters or it's GAME OVER for all.Usually these days, I avoid Sandler-starring/produced films in movie theaters and wait for its DVD release (my last one seeing in theaters was 2008's Don't Mess with the Zohan), but when I first heard of him being thrown into a battle against classic 80s video game characters, they already had me at ""video games."" After witnessing Wreck-It Ralph back in 2012, I was entranced and drooling in 80s/90s arcade nostalgia. Those same elements were used again for an Adam Sandler comedy, so I rushed immediately to the theater to see if it can actually work. In the end, it had a few misogynistic moments, predictable outcomes, interesting celeb cameos, and typical dysfunctional humor used in many Happy Madison Production films. But when you throw in Olaf and Tyrion Lannister into the mix, its brand of humor now feels very much like Wreck-It Ralph crossed with Ghostbusters. One scene, for example, that was pretty clever was luring Pac-Man into chasing the lead guys in their appropriately color-coded vehicles, thus making the city look like a giant maze for him to roam around like in his original arcade game. Though the characters may not have had the best one-liners in some scenes or lacking true chemistry, it's a visual joyride for new, young generation gamers. Whereas old-school gamers of the 80s-90s will appreciate the nods and tributes, but will notice the lack in depth to see it as a good movie. Nevertheless, I liked seeing these four main guys (armed with proton pack-like weapons) getting themselves caught in harsh predicaments when lives are on the line, albeit with humorous results. Shouldn't be overlooked for a summer flick. Try a few quarters and there might be something good out of this. Game on!",Pixels

The whole idea of earth being attacked by aliens in the form of video game characters is silly - but still good material for a fun summer movie. Unfortunately, it's not a fun summer movie at all. I will admit that this is definitely a guilty pleasure, and that gamers and 80's kids will probably love it just for the nostalgia factor, but as a movie, it's really bad. Adam Sandler is consistently mocked for his quality of movies, which has been going steadily downhill, and can't seem to recover. This movie is part of that massive slump. It features the double whammy of him playing a former expert gamer who is now a mechanic with Kevin James, who is now President of the United States. That's every bit as bad as it sounds. The plot is that in the early 1980s, a satellite was sent into space containing items from Earth, including several retro video games. This was seen by the aliens who recovered it as a threat, so they recreated these creatures and sent them to wreak havoc on Earth. It's goofy, yes, but it could be great fun. Perhaps the biggest problem with this movie is that it could be just good fun, but it's really not. It's dull, cliché, and forgettable. The characters aren't interesting and the story is bland. However, the references to the old games are nice, and it's cool how each action scene reflects the games so well (like the Pac-Man scene in New York). Q*Bert was probably the best character in this movie. He actually curses this time. What happens to him at the end is just... freaking disgusting. All in all, it's not as bad as it could be.

133,michael-3204,"Not good, but not as bad as you've heard",4,13 September 2016,"Since I came to this film well past its release, I had plenty of time to prepare for what seemed to be almost universally regarded as one of the worst movies of 2015. As often seems to be the case with critical pile-ons, it turns out not to be that bad. That's not to say it is very good, but it's not the steaming pile of excrement lots of critics made it out to be. Most of the lazy, unsuccessful attempts at humor come from Adam Sandler and Kevin James, both of whom are more subdued and less obnoxious than is often the case. Unfortunately, they don't seem to have figured out anything interesting or funny to substitute for their usual antics, and so come off as boring. But a much better supporting cast than they deserve helps buoy the film when their own tedium threatens to sink it. Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan, Peter Dinklage, and in smaller but well-played roles, Sean Bean and Brian Cox, as well as several lesser known actors keep this from being the painful experience I was half-expecting.For my money, the premise buys a lot of good will. I didn't see the short ""Pixels"" is based on, but the idea of an alien superpower who misinterprets 1980s arcade games as a declaration of war and sends an army of Pac-Men, Centipedes and Donkey Kongs to attack the Earth is as inspired as high-concept concepts come. A filmmaker would have to go out of his way to screw that delightful idea up completely, and director Chris Columbus doesn't. Given that he has to work with a story where the most ludicrous notion is not that aliens attack us with Pac-Man, but that Kevin James is the President of the United States, he does a decent job of keeping the film mostly on-track and keeping the action light and fun. There are too many dead spots -- all of them when either Sandler or James are on-screen, and especially when they're together -- to make this as enjoyable as it wants to be or could have been. But if you find the concept of this film is at all attractive, you should give it a shot.",Pixels

In order to combat them, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his old childhood friend and former classic video game champion and current ""nerd installer"" Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of classic video game players Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) and Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and also a colonel and weapons developer Violet van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) to try to save the planet.After reading some of the other reviews for this film, I found that most people did not like this film. I understood some of their points but I didn't think it is as bad as they made it out to be. I just want to say that despite the fact that the trailer makes it look like the film is for kids, it is not. This film is recommended for at least teens. Adam Sandler's films this last decade have been rather hit or miss but mostly misses and this one is not a miss but is not quite a hit either. Just like his films, the jokes in this one are hit or miss but in this case, they are mostly hits with some misses. The acting in this film wasn't remarkable either. Adam Sandler plays the same character he has played in numerous other films. The role could have probably been played by another actor and be just as good if not better. Kevin James is serviceable as President Cooper. Josh Gad was good as the clumsy, fat guy Ludlow and got to recite some of the film's funniest one-liners. Peter Dinklage's Eddie was arguably trying too hard. Michelle Monaghan's Violet was OK but had no chemistry with Sam which made their romantic scenes a little cringe-worthy and unbelievable. Sure the story doesn't make too much sense either but the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously and does a decent job of not taking itself too seriously either. For me, the best part of the film has to be the special effects. The way in which they bring all the classic video games to life was rather good. All of the classic video games of the 80s were well represented which was appreciated. The way in which people go in and out of pixelation and how environments got destroyed via pixelation was nice to see. I was also curious as to how they were able to alter old 80s video footage as well (I won't spoil why this happens). This film is nowhere near the best film of the year and will probably not be on any best of thew year lists but I was entertained.

Fast forward to 2015, the lives of this band of nerdy brothers have gone down different paths. Sam is an installation technician and Will has become the President of the United States. Even though they are still close friends, their life responsibilities carry different levels of significance, until they are drawn back together when aliens attack the earth. The explanation for the attack is that the extra-terrestrials received the 1982 message from NASA and saw it as declaration of war on their planet. Their response to this unintentional call to arms is to send the classic video games to attack earth as pixelated weapons. Sam and Will have to re-connect with their former video game competitors and work with the world armed forces to fight off the nostalgic alien invasion. Similar to the life cycle in the video games, the team is given three attempts by the space invaders to apply their former gaming skills and to discover the answers to saving the world from an Atari- inspired annihilation. Pixels, as a concept, is refreshingly original and has the potential to serve as a digital bridge between multiple generations. The other potential hope for this film is director Chris Columbus at the helm, he has produced some great family films throughout his career. This hope was for Columbus to take this convoluted storyline, which has the potential to go the way of fun and nostalgic hilarity or he could produce a mess of a film with catastrophic proportions, and make a great family comedy. Unfortunately, Pixels falls into the latter category as a mess. Columbus attempts to deliver a 1980's retro style film with ridiculous characters and situations with a modern computer-generated spin, but fails to deliver. This failure has to do with the inclusion of Adam Sandler and Kevin James as the lead characters. At this stage in their acting careers, they seem unable to deliver original comedic performances. Their roles are as predictable as the patterns in the old video games. They walk through their performances in this film with little enthusiasm and with a reliance on dated comedic styles that have worn out their welcome. Josh Gad provides the potential for originality, but he falls into the trap of overacting which attempts to compensate for Sandler and James' weak performances. Also, the only reasonable explanation for Peter Dinklage and Michelle Monaghan being part of this project was to potentially procure a comedy on their resume. Unfortunately, they are poorly cast in parts that any credible actor should have given a miss. If all of these components were not bad enough, the truly frustrating thing about Pixels is not in the weak story line or the poor performances, but the fact that this is promoted as a family film. The humour and innuendo is not funny and is not appropriate for children. The marketing conveys that this film should be accessible for any generation to enjoy on a Saturday afternoon, but what happens is the potential for embarrassing conversations with small children on a multitude of levels. For example, why Eddie Plant is going to the White House's Lincoln bedroom with Martha Stewart and Serena Williams or the stalker-type mentality of the Ludlow character. So much of the film was creepy to experience as an adult, much less trying to explain it to children. This review should not be misconstrued as prudish, but more of holding the marketing team to account for the disservice to families. In the concept stages, Pixels may have had the potential to be a fun adventure for people who grew up in the 80's and potentially for a new generation, too. In the end, it proves to be an embarrassment for those linked to this production and for anyone who might go to see it. Leaving the cinema... Avoid the potential awkward conversations with your children and give Pixels a miss. It is one of the rare films that I would not recommend for any audience. Do not be fooled, it is not funny or a family film. Game Over. Bigger questions: 1. Do we all have a role in this life? (Proverbs 16:9, Romans 8:28) 2. What is the Bible's view on war? (Ecclesiastes 3:8, Matthew 26:52) 3. Why do people still go to Adam Sandler and Kevin James films?

It has it all, and I was really surprised to see this amazing idea come from the Adam Sandler crew. It's based on a short film, but they made this movie work. Really the only problem I have is some of the jokes thrown in, but it cancels out when you realize they just want to make an original action flick.",Pixels

141,Badmoviessuck,A huge produkt placement,4,6 January 2019,"Pixel is a dumb movie.
I see a lot of people rating it 10/10 and i don't know what they see in these movies.
Sure it was entertaining but entertainment dosen't equal good.
And saying that it's for kids and you shouldn't critique it is stupid.CHARACTER
The characters sucked.
Sam is a dude who plays video games and has no character arc or depth he stays the same.
Violet is the smart girl who also knows acrobatics and she shoots guns.
She is bland and has no character arc either.
Ludlow is the fat nerd who screams and is also a good gamer but he lacks any depth character arc or development.
That guy in prison (i forgot his name) has a character arc that's very short and rushed.
He is a cheater Matty says ""Hey! you're a cheater"" Prison guy says ""I don't care"" Matty responds ""Ok"" Prison guy changes his mind and dosen't cheat even though it's a life threatening situation.
Why does Matty even care if he cheats i mean this is a life threatening situation so who cares if he cheats.
Q-Bert is a plot device he is there so that the plot can reach conclusion.FINAL ACT
It's stupid.
The evil people says that they broke the rule not explaining why and how and Q-Bert is used so that they can reach conclusion.VERDICT
This movie is stupid and those giving it above 6/10 i don't understand those people.
Those reviewers just ignore the important aspects of filmmaking and say ""I enjoyed it so that means that the film critics are stupid and pretentious"" your enjoyment dosen't matter.
You can enjoy something but know it's bad like this movie, i enjoyed it but i know how bad it is.",Pixels

Adam Sandler has, in my view, the potential to be a great actor... ...That said, PIXELS is NOT him showing that he has that potential - Adam Sandler is Adam Sandler!!! If you have seen any Sandler movie before, you know exactly what you are going to get...And alongside him are all his old SNL Buddies which does not help people who review this movie as its all been done before.Kevin James as President Cooper should rightly get the WORST casting role... But actually he is not so bad.That Credit has to go to Peter Dinklage, Which is actually rather unfair - Dinklage acts brilliantly! Its just his character is so over the top and poorly written... And in all honesty, had ANYONE ELSE been given his role - They would have failed miserably...Much as his character is really poor... He manages to save it and you actually end up liking the piece of (Censored!)So, Yeah! The film is a typical Sandler-Fest... But honestly, its not as bad as many reviewers are making out.Yes there are some damn serious plot-holes...

I'll have you know, the audience I was with knew what they came for. They consistently laughed at the comedy, was dazzled by the visual effects, and clapped their hands at certain parts whether a joke or a visual effect was done well. The jokes are hilarious- whether it be visual or verbal. If you see this film, screen the 3D version- you won't be disappointed. A lot of the action and destruction scenes are wonderfully done- CGI or not. Not a lot of ""bodily functions"" or ""raunchy"" humor- and when it does crack a gross-out joke, it's actually funny!! Great callbacks to 80s pop culture. Stay for the credits also- it's a very cool pix-elated sequence that sums up the events of the picture. Don't believe the haters who probably don't have a good sense of humor or imagination- go with your friends and/or family, get a bucket of popcorn, relax and enjoy the show!!

151,AxProductions,Odd?,6,6 June 2020,"This movie is very strange to review as it is one of those that you will enjoy, but isn't technically good movie.
It's overacted, feels crazy, and breaks loads of rules making this movies technical score (not talking about cgi, rather story and use of cinematography editing ext.) more of a 4/10. However, it's not aimed at movie geeks like me, but rather families, and people that don't take notice of plot holes and bad acting, they just watch the movie for what it is, a movie.
It depends entirely on what you class as a good movie, I personally like films like gone girls, and zodiac (both Fincher films), that have great acting, feel real, and every detail is calculated to an insane extent, but would a kid enjoy almost 50% of a film being dialogue (even if it is amazing dialogue), no.So, in essence, I recommend this film as a family film, and to people that don't look into every detail of a film. But not to anyone that actually cares about acting and story, and cinematography, well actually the cinematography isn't awful.So, as a film geek, and on a technical bases I'd rate it a 35/100
but on entertainment level, i'd rate it 58/100I would recommend wreck it Ralph to people instead of this film, similar concept, but a better portrayal.",Pixels

No-one involved with it seems to care about it, so why should I?The script is based on a short film ( although the animated series Futurama came up with this idea many years earlier) but the attempt to turn the short into a feature failed as soon as Adam Sandler was involved.Sandler appears to make zero effort in this flick. He looks bored, almost sedated. When scenes require complex visual effects Sandler merely goes through the motions, with a "" they'll fix this in post"" expression on his face. It just feels like he wants to get back to his trailer and go back to sleep.kevin James is in this, playing the US President! If that piece of casting alone doesn't tell you what a lazy, lowest common denominator money grab this is, then I don't know what will.The use of 80s video games is a cynical attempt to cash in on nostalgia.

Although it's true that some of the jokes fell flat that can be said of many, many films, so I won't hold that against it.

I purchased 10 and was going to get those two free ones come hell or high water.I fall into that perfect age group where I would spend the weekend at the video arcade playing the games highlighted in this movie so I figured there was a chance that I would like this one.

When I was reading through the reviews in this site, I generally thought it maybe won't be so bad. Well I finally watched the movie and... Well the title says it all basically. Honestly, this movie was goddamn terrible. Half of the movie didn't make any sense, you couldn't feel any emotions for any character (not sure if that was the purpose), and one thing only drunk and complete morons could do: Kevin James as the US President ?!?!?! Who was stupid enough to think it'll make sense ?!?! Also this film is generally pretty idiotic and at times cheesy as hell. One last thing out all the dumb stuff that happened throughout this film, is that when Lady Lisa suddenly shows up, and after she have a little ''battle'' (pretty much she just shows Ludlow her moves), Ludlow suddenly says a kinda stupid line, then she begins to smile, and kiss him....? I put a question mark because when I saw this my jaw dropped from the level of stupidity of this scene. OK now look, the reason I gave it 2/10 is because the opening scene was the least awful scene in the entire movie, and because the way they created the classic video game characters were kinda nice. Overall, terrible movie, you can't have emotions for no character because almost 90% of the movie was utter non-sense, and if you let your kids watch this- you basically say ''Screw You Childhood !''",Pixels

It stars Adam Sandler, Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad, Michelle Monaghan and Kevin James.When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players (Peter Dinklage, Josh Gad) and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) to save the planet.No, just no. I usually start my reviews with the positives. Okay. The visuals looked crisp and virtual like the old arcade games. That's a major plus this movie has going for it. It also has some moderately funny performances from Gad and Dinklage. Done! Now this is the worst movie of the year. I don't like to give out F's it seems too harsh. This movie doesn't get one. I don't like to write reviews on movie that I didn't enjoy very much. This is the exception. I refused to write a review on Hot Pursuit and Soaked in Bleach because I didn't hate those movies. I hate this one!This movie has nothing funny or interesting to say. It spews out so much garbage that it's almost painful to watch. Adam Sandler kills. What? The role? NO! The movie. His performance is as wooden as Woody from Toy Story(great movie, I am in no way comparing the two) and much more bland. Kevin James' comedy is dry and stale. He's basically the clumsy guy who breaks a ton of stuff. Who thought that that would be entertaining or funny? The direction is fine but could've been better. I didn't expect much from the men that wrote This Means War and Grown Ups 2, at least they didn't disappoint.Overall this movie was bad and borderline unwatchable.

There are no real feels to any of the characters in the movie. They all seems to just stand on the screen with no real interests in their characters. The whole cast is very very underutilized. All performances feels and looks very under performed. Pixels lacks the entertaining and enjoyable fun factor of good action comedy movie and its just a dull wastage of very good concept idea. The story plot is very unconvincing and uninteresting and whole feel of the movie is very dull. The storyline idea is good but looks very dumb on the screen in the terms of a good movie and fails to deliver the beauty of its concept. The script, is below average, lacks interesting elements, and has pacing issues. The movie feels very slow and boring in many useless scenes. As a fan of these classic games I was really disappointed by the film. The only positive thing about the movie Pixels is some Visual shots and effects of those old classic arcade games and the performance of Peter Dinklage is good to certain points. Some gaming characters like Pac Man looks good in 3D and some 3D Visual scenes are interesting.

He's had only a couple of movies that I have liked, e.g. The Wedding Singer and Anger Management. After Pixels got panned by pretty much every professional critic out there, I was pretty sure I was never going to watch it...Then, I was going to spend time with my mother and she asked me if there were any decent movies to rent. So, I jokingly said Pixels. I thought she knew what it was, knew it was an Adam Sandler movie, would know I was kidding, and pass it over at the Red Box. To my surprise, she showed up with Pixels in hand. My mother hates ""stupid"" comedies and she hates Adam Sandler. I started laughing and apologizing for the confusion. She asked what the movie was about and I began to tell her what I knew from the trailer but I couldn't recite the premise without bursting out laughing - aliens, video games, death match - it's all ludicrous. I think the premise was so ridiculous, it actually intrigued her so much, she wanted to see how bad the movie actually is. Besides, she already rented it.Is the movie ridiculous? Yup. Is Kevin James as president outside of belief? Absolutely. Is designing and building guns from an arcade game in less than a week outside of any scientific possibility? Of course. Did I like the movie? Uh huh. Did my mother like the movie? Why, yes she did. Did she laugh out loud a few times? Amazingly, yes. If you care about the believability of the plot, you are going to hate the movie. It's about aliens sending Pacman, among others, to Earth - the believability is out the door before the movie even begins. Were there plenty of plot holes? I'm sure there were but I was too busy enjoying the inanity of the whole thing to notice. If you are watching an Adam Sandler movie to point out plot holes and what not, save yourself the time and don't watch it. And, Adam Sandler was far less whiny and annoying in this role.In conclusion, I thought the movie was adorable (and so did my mom). If you're looking for light-hearted silly fun movie to waste 2 hours on, you could do worse! Also, Peter Dinklage is so hilarious here, he steals the show.",Pixels

There.Having said that I saw some reviews for Pixels on here that suggested I should give this as a try, with superlatives such as 'hilarious', 'laugh out loud' and 'brilliant' used to describe the humour and entertainment to be had - flying in the face of the critics who described it as a dog.They were very, very wrong and, I hate to say it but the critics were spot on.Sandler is as unappealing as ever and the humour childish and unfunny throughout - though he isn't the only bad thing about this film by a long way. The performances are poor without exception, some of the actors (such as Kevin James as a bungling President) are woefully mis-cast and all are easily outperformed by their pixelated co-stars.The ending is just as moronic as the rest of the film. The special effects are okay in the action sequences. The storyline is confused and it feels as if the film lasts for 3 hours, though apparently the running time is 'only' 1 hr 45. Perhaps someone became aware of this as the final large setpiece feels rushed. The soundtrack is plastered over the top of the film as if in some grotesque afterthought.All in all, it left me puzzled. Who would this film appeal to ? The average teen would have outgrown the unsophisticated, in-your-face, clumsy humour...and would be too young to be aware of the so-called 'classic' games that the movie is presumably trying to evoke some feeling of nostalgia for.Next time - I will listen the critics (and my intuition) and give anything with Adam Sandler a wiiide berth.",Pixels

The movie doesn't have a lot of hard laughs and every time there was an opportunity for one, it dropped the ball. That being said there are lots of chuckles.The cast works really well together but that's not a shock because most of them are part of the Happy Madison family. PIXELS doesn't really pick up until we see Josh Gad. Adam Sandler may be the star of the film but all the best lines and funny parts are given to Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage. Also, keep your eyes open for Dan Aykroyd and the product placement of his crystal head vodka.PIXELS has a nice blend of light laughs, romance, sci-fi, gun action and car action. The film moves at a nice pace and it goes by fast. This film is fun for the whole family, young and old; the music is a 80s greatest hits soundtrack and really ties the film together.The c.g is fun, cute and really well done... One thing that bugged me the first time I watched PIXELS was that Q-Burt could talk. But then after the 2nd viewing, I figured that he is an alien not the real game character and he is a big part of the movie so he has to speak. Another thing that PIXELS does is point out the generation gap, but as someone who plays a lot of classic arcade games, I'm shocked that some kids don't know about arcades. Hopefully this film will make younger kids want to find and play arcade classics.I'm so happy about this film, I was hoping for big laughs and even though there weren't any, it wasn't a let down. The story was good, the action was fun and it was awesome seeing my favorite classic arcade games come to life in the real world.

165,keal,I'm an old school gamer and this was a perfect tribute,10,22 October 2015,"As a kid I was one of the gamers who made the local news. I got to the end of Pac-Man. I could play forever on Robotron: 2084. To this day I have MAME always loaded on a PC and I go through the old games. I do love Skyrim and Super Hexagon, so as a gamer, I'm complete. I read all the bad reviews on Pixels, but I just had to see it for myself. I was pleasantly surprised.I never cared for Adam Sandler's other films, having only sit through Happy Gilmore. I couldn't stomach much else of his. But maybe he gets better as he ages, or I get more tolerant as I do. Either way, I couldn't find a single bad thing about this film. If you're an old school gamer, this movie is a great treat.The footage of the old arcade games in the beginning - the games didn't have video screen artifacts. Basically, they weren't pixellated as they were supposed to be. I forgave that. I mean, who cares, really? That's about the only inconsistency I could find, and it was trivial.The film was entertaining from beginning to end. Especially nice was during the end credits. They replay the entire movie in 8-bit format. It was easy to see that Pixels was a labor of love, and I guess you have to be an old school gamer to appreciate it all. This is a classic, and I'm happy to be alive to have gotten to see this. I can imagine what it's like to be Stan Lee, and see all your superhero creations come to life as some of the most successful films of all time. To see the 80's arcade culture brought to life and memorialized in Pixels, it's a similar feeling, one that all gamers can share.I highly recommend this film. I give it a perfect score. Well deserved.",Pixels
166,ufster-2,The delicious irony is too thick to ignore,5,5 March 2016,"It's a good enough movie to waste some otherwise would be empty hours but the buck stops there. The delicious irony of it is that the protagonist of the movie is someone who feels they can only deliver worthy performances when they play video games that have predictable patterns, you know, just like movies with Adam Sandler starring in them. It's as if they throw darts at a rotating board filled with random words stickied on to it, just to see what it lands on so they can come up with these movies. Sandler throws first, dart lands on nerd, he plays the nerd. Sandler buddy number one throws second, dart lands on president, he plays the president. Sandler buddy number two throws last, dart lands on conspiracy theorist loner, he plays the conspiracy theorist loner.Just don't forget to throw in a delightfully cute piece of romantic interest in the mix (Monaghan) so that our nerdy hero gets his trophy at the end of the movie, since any flick that panders to nerds has to have some type of fan service add the chick with swords, long legs and cleavage and voila... you have one more forgettable movie on your Netflix catalogue.",Pixels

When aliens reply to a capsule of video games sent into space when Sandler's character was a kid - Sandler must join forces with a ""Few Good Men"", to destroy the attack from the aliens. You know what's funny? The aliens send the same video game villains to destroy everything they come in contact with that was sent in the capsule. Now is the time for a battle of video game skills and great courageous tactics. You will see video game characters from your childhood - you will see a bunch of dopey guys trying to save the world - Don't take this movie too seriously and you will enjoy it - I find some comedies offensive - but the humor is clean and family friendly - You gotta see this movie - It's really funny and worth a watch.",Pixels

He's had s few bad ones but what actor hasn't. This movie is for grownups and kids. It's not predictable and the movie is pretty good. It wasn't a bore but it wasn't a 10 either like others said on here (they are related to someone in the movie or paid)If you are a sandler fan you will like it. If you are a gamer you will really like it. If you are a fan of both you will love this movie. . I saw 3 movies this weekend including mission impossible and both were about the same. An 8 out of 10. I actually liked this one better. Would recommend for the whole family. Again it's not the best of any Adam sandler movie I've seen but it's great entertainment for a night out.

Adam Sandler plays his usual humble character who starts out as a loser and ends up with impressing the girl and doing the seeming impossible. He came up with a novel scenario and meets the fun needs of the viewers. At least the ones who didn't start out the movie intending to hate it.MY OWN TAKE ON IT was that it was an update of Ghostbusters, and even included ghosts of a sort (PACMAN ghosts) in the process. It was pretty much Bill Murray and company battling surreal enemies, engaging in witty repartee with the heroine, and using similar pasted-together high-tech devices to battle the enemy with.

Or ""...Cats and dogs living together"".I thought it was a nice romp.I DO wonder if anyone panned Ghostbusters as much when it came out.",Pixels
172,eichler2,Not nearly as bad as reviews made it out to be,7,29 June 2017,"I avoided seeing this movie for two years until it came on free TV, just based on the abysmal reviews when it first came out. To those who trashed it so badly - what were you expecting? It's an Adam Sandler movie, it's not going to be masterpiece theatre.So the premise is ridiculous (aliens create weapons based on 80s arcade games to attack the Earth), the script is silly and at times self-contradictory, some of the humor induces groans rather than laughs and a lot of the acting was over-the-top. OK, maybe I'm seeing where those bad reviews came from...But if, like me, you practically lived in the arcades in the 80s, this movie is just jam-packed with nods and references to games like Centipede, Pac Man, Donkey Kong, Space Invaders, Robotron, Burger Time and others. It was fun just trying to identify which games all the alien attackers came from.My one gripe is that there were some characters that were just made up for the movie. I was scratching my head trying to figure out what game the purple ninjas were from, or where the red dressed warrior lady came from. Turns out they were both invented for the film.Another questionable aspect is why the intellectual level of this movie is clearly aimed at pre-teens. They weren't even born when these games were popular.Overall though, if you're looking for a mindless comedy with well done special effects and tons of 80s video game references, this makes for an entertaining couple hours. Just don't expect an Oscar winning film.",Pixels

177,AlukardsCastle,Future Cult Classic,10,4 August 2015,"I was excited for this movie. I knew the critics were going to go hard on it. I knew that most of the so called professional critics weren't even going to see the movie and would trash it based solely on Adam Sandler and Kevin James. I don't blindly hate Adam Sandler like most of the drones nowadays. Sure he had horrible movies in the past few years like Jack and Jill, the Grown Ups movies, and Thats My Boy. But he's had more hit than miss. He's even proved he can be a dramatic actor in his masterful performance in Punch Drunk Love, which I wish he would try again. So seeing the trailers for this really intrigued me. I knew not to expect much substance. I just knew it was going to be a fun comedy action movie. When the movie was finally in theaters my predictions of the unwarranted hateful reviews were spot on. But did that stop me from going to see it? Heck no. I've learned long ago not to trust movie critics most of the time. Sometimes their right. This isn't one of those times. *Plot* I'm sure you already know the basics. The US sends a message containing cultural phenomena such as video games, movies and music out into space in the 80s. Years later the aliens come back having taken the message as an act of war and are attacking the Earth in various countries in the form of classic video games. It's up to the presidents life long best friend, a video game arcade champion from childhood and current home theater installer adult to save the day with help from other video game virtuosos. What unfolds is a series of battles in the form of 'stages' in video games to help save the earth from these aliens. Yes, it's ludicrous. Yes, Adam Sandler is a hero in this movie. Yes, Kevin James is the president. So what? This movie was very funny. I don't know what the critics were talking about this time especially. The jokes weren't flat. I haven't laughed this much at an Adam Sandler movie in years. It was also good. Sure there were some moments that made me roll my eyes, like the whole side plot of romance. Also, Adam Sandler had a few funny lines, but he's not even the real star of this movie. The real stars are the supporting cast and the video game representations which were spot on. Josh Gad was so funny it hurt. Peter Dinklage was painfully hilarious. And as far as Kevin James being president goes, he did a good job at being funny but restrained at the same time. I'm sure most people were assuming he would be the wacky character of Paul Blart in a presidents suit. Wrong. Even the kids who played the young versions of the characters in the beginning did a great job. The theater I was in was full of laughter throughout at least 90% of the movie. Oh and the soundtrack was superb in catching the style of the 80s. The action scenes were intense. The visual effects used to created the classic video game characters were done so perfectly. But again there were action parts that were so over the top that they were lame such as Adam Sandlers character driving in reverse off of a parking garage and shooting the enemy dead before safely landing on a lower buildings roof. But then I remembered 'Why shouldn't I believe that when I'm believing that these video game characters are out and about?'. Exactly, some critics who actually saw the movie took the unbelievable plot too seriously. The low score on many sites surely affected its Box Office. But mark my words, the reviews and comments from people who actually saw the movie and loved it, are in the majority and they will help this movie rebound into the cult classic it's destined to be. Here's an example. When the movie first came out, its score on this website was a meager 4.4/10. Less than two weeks, and the day I'm typing this review the score has risen to 5.5/10. Though not a high score, this does show that the reviews are quickly getting more positive. As the negative scalding reviews are starting to get lost in the crowd of love for this movie. I predict in the future it will reach the mid to high 6/10 territory. Don't let the Sandler haters crowd your judgement. This is meant to be seen on the big screen. Don't take it too seriously. Go take your kids or see it with friends. Especially if you were a kid during the 80s or know other people who were around during that time. This will be a huge blast of fun nostalgia for you and others if so. But even if you don't recognize all the throwbacks in this movie, you will still have a good time! This was probably the best Adam Sandler comedy since Anger Management. But I dare say it's his best and most fun movie altogether. I would love to see a sequel!",Pixels
178,RemusGrey,"A ""Ghostbusters meets Wreck-it Ralph"" Sandler film as fun as the best video game level",7,11 October 2015,"Pixels is all about aliens on 1982 who intercepts video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet. Pixels is based on a Youtube short with the same title (Pixels) created by Patrcik Jean. Adam Sandler's movies always has these kind of good ideas but with something really wrong. The problem were some of the jokes. They fell flat, really flat. That's the first problem of the movie, flat jokes. The second problem is the acting of Sandler. To be honest, Kevin James acting was okay. Josh Gad's and Peter Dinklage's acting was very good, but the weakest is Michelle Monaghan's who doesn't look like she likes her role. Adam Sandler's acting is worse than Monaghan's. Sandler is not trying to give his best, and he ended up looking like he gave up in acting. He was better in Hotel Transylvania where he looked like he was happy with his role. But the biggest problem yet is its promotion. No, it's not the marketing and advertisements, it's what it wants others to do such as yell at their parents, be disrespectful to others, etc. It was advertised a lot to children but swearing and those what I listed? Those are very unacceptable to kids. And finally, the lack of story. All just for laughs. However, that should be part of your expectations for the movie. That's what is always part of a Sandler movie, no story and all for laughs. But there is one thing that is rare in Sandler films, the films being enjoyable. If Adam Sandler and Kevin James wasn't here, I'm very sure it would have a 6.7 - 7.5 score since it was directed by Chris Colombus, director of Harry Potter and Home Alone which had a 7.0+ score. Pixels is just like watching someone play a ""Wreck-it Ralph meets Ghostbusters"" level. Although charmless, it is as fun as the best video game level there is. I don't care if haters will bash me or hurt me with their words just because I enjoyed Pixels. It actually didn't deserve hatred.7/10P.s. Apologies for short and rushed review.

Eh, i strongly disagree whit this, Adam is a great actor, the things that put him down are bad scripts, but in this movie he did an amazing job.Never in my life have i seen a movie about video games, and actually be good. I thought there was a good reason that this movie had such a low rating, so i set off to investigate and i came back whit pretty much nothing apart from the ""bandwagon"" i talked about earlier and the fact of people saying that this movie is not ""realistic,"" its a movie with 80's video games for crying out loud.This movie has surpassed my expectations and also made me giggle like a school girl. It had an interesting story (as far as video games go).Also, hats off to the CGI department, simply amazing animations, it really felt as if the actors were actually where they seem to be.So, if you like 80's video games, like a nice comedy and have a spare 1 hour and 46 minutes on your hands i really recommend you watch this movie.",Pixels
180,jonandshellie,A Fun Movie That Does Not Deserve the Bad Reviews!,8,31 May 2016,"After seeing 'Pixels' several times now thanks to Starz, I can't help but wonder why the movie was panned so badly by critics and fans alike during its theatrical run? It's an enjoyable film with funny characters, tight direction by family film veteran Chris Columbus, a decent script, and good acting by everyone involved. My only guess is that the backlash is due to one factor and one factor only - Adam Sandler and his Happy Madison crew were involved in the project. Not that Sandler was bad in the film, he was as good as he ever was. I think it's more of a bias built on a foundation of bad/sub-par movies that Sandler has released in recent years (i.e. ""Grown Up's 2"", ""Just Go With It"", ""Jack and Jill"", ""That's My Boy"" etc.), but I think that people are letting their resentment of Sandler cloud their judgement on this film which is a delightful family film rooted in a ton of 80's arcade game nostalgia. The film and everyone involved don't deserve that and if people would just ease up on their biases a bit then they'd see that the movie is a fun fantasy romp with likable characters and an interesting premise developed from a French short film of the same name. Sure the story is far-fetched, but it was a fun ride and is a movie that is a great Saturday night flick with the kids. Not to go into too much detail, but the premise of the story is simple - It is 1982 and Sam Brenner (Sandler) is a teenage arcade game whiz who is talked into enter the World Video Game Championships by his friend Will Cooper (James). During the championships, Sam and Will meet another contestant, an eccentric young kid named Ludlow Lamansoff (Gad). In the finals Sam has to face-off with Eddie ""Fireblaster"" Plant (Dinklage), another teenage arcade game whiz. Sam eventually loses to Plant and it haunts him for the rest of his life. In the current day, Sam has grown up to become a Audio/Video installer and Will Cooper has become the President of the United States. After a mysterious attack it is discovered that a video of the 1982 World Championships was sent into outer space on a probe. The probe was intercepted by an alien civilization and the games on the video were misinterpreted as a threat by the aliens who proceed to develop weaponry similar tot he games to battle Earth in winner-take-all battle. Once it is discovered that the aliens are using old arcade games to fight us, President Cooper employs Sam, Ludlow, and Eddie to help use their old-school gamer skills to team up and stave off the attackers. Again, this a fun movie that really ignites old-school arcade/video game nostalgia and does a great job of interweaving old games into the modern time-line of the film. I highly recommend it to anyone.",Pixels

There was no science, reasonable explanations, or context; (3) A ROMANCE - Not at all. Whatever human contact the characters had was superficial, boring, and trivial. The opportunity was there but promptly discarded. (4) TRAGEDY - Not in the least, except for perhaps a few minutes toward the end. (5) SPECTACLE - Yes.In effect these elements were touched on, but not one was fully embraced, and by no means explored (except the COLOR-SPECTACLE). There were perhaps 3-4 laughs to be had, one about every 30 minutes. I honestly can't say when it came off the rails, but it was very early on, I would guess when the two arrive at the White House.

However, despite that, it still has every Sandler trope used in a movie, a loser overlooked by society, and there's a girl involved. The majority of the jokes are DOA, nothing's really funny, and the acting is just strange, with the exception of Michelle Monaghan. But, to be fair, this movie is fun if you take into account of the main story. Forget the romance. Aliens in the form of classic video game characters invading and attacking Earth is an awesome concept, but adding Adam Sandler, Kevin James, and Josh Gad's over-the-top ""paranoid conspiracy theorist"" into this movie, it just kills it, and we're watching a movie with a sense of boredom.

186,benaboo,I'm not gonna lie this is one of Adam Sandler's best.,7,7 September 2017,I love this movie! This is one of my favorites from Adam Sandler. It felt like a birthday present from Adam Sandler because it came out the day after my birthday but I took advantage of the early 7:00 showings and I laughed throughout the entire movie. Adam Sandler was funny as usual but was eventually outshined by Josh Gad. I liked Kevin James as the President. A lot of people thought he was a poor choice but I thought it worked for this movie. Michelle Monaghan was great. I don't think Peter Dinklage was the best thing about the movie but he was good. I really liked the presence of Brian Cox but I wish there was more of him. I liked the fact that Sean Bean was in it but I don't care for the accent he used. I was surprised that Ashley Benson had no dialogue but she's pretty and I thought her character was pretty cool. I honestly think this and Pearl Harbor are some of the most underrated movies I've ever seen. I don't entirely get why people hate this movie because it has a great concept. It's like people think a movie's automatically bad because Adam Sandler's involved. He has talent. Sure he plays the same character in almost every movie he's in but if you're like me you can set that aside and enjoy his movies. I'm not saying all Adam Sandler movies are great but I enjoy most of them. Why was this the movie that had people saying that Adam Sandler has to quit movies? This movie is an Academy Award winner compared to what I've seen of Jack and Jill. It makes me sad that after this movie he basically started acting in Netflix movies. I am glad that The Meyerowitz Stories is getting a limited release in theaters but I do hope Adam Sandler comes back. This movie is not without its problems. I don't like how it just jumps into the some of the action sequences without any set up and it would have been nice if there could have been more 80s songs like Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins. I also wish (as I said before) that Brian Cox appeared in the final scene congratulating the arcaders on their victory and apologizing for doubting them. Maybe the movie would have been more successful if it had actors like Robert Downey Jr but it's great for what it is and I enjoy this movie..,Pixels

He plays a video game nerd that had a chance of making it big as a child, only to come in second place, and thus be regulated to a life of drudgery. Having your best friend become president and still want to hang out with you doesn't seem to qualify as ""cool"" or ""awesome."" Just tedious. Now, as an adult, he works as a NERD, a computer guy based on the Geek squad, and installs electronics in homes (when not hanging with the leader of the free world). Aliens attack our planet, using our old video games as the basis of their attacks, and it is up to Sandler, Dinklage, and Lamansoff, all three contenders from a video game competition from 30 years ago, to save the world. There are so many problems with this movie. It's clunky. It's stupid. It can only appeal to small children, and even they must have had some traumatic brain injury to be able to enjoy this movie. Given the premise, of video game superstars fending off video game monsters, you have to know that children are going to be attending in droves. Make it kid friendly. This movie doesn't try to cater to them--a question of what to call a male maggot was answered with, ""Mangina?"" a cross between maggot and vagina. Funny? No. Not at all. Did the children laugh? They didn't understand. Now...am I supposed to explain to my 8 year old what a ""mangina"" is? The rest of the cast just phoned in their parts.

You can certainly feel the Sandler moments, they were evident from the very beginning and all through the movie, some of them were great, some were kinda ""meh"" so I get why some people are blaming him. I will say however that I can't see this particular movie working the way it did without anyone other than him, for one very obvious reason; the writing. The movie tries hard to tell a story from a VERY lighthearted perspective and basically far out ""would probably never happen"" world, that being 2 kids who played video games at a young age, turned out to be the president of the united states, and a TV install guy. The flow of the movie seemed to take the situation of alien invaders VERY lightly, at one point they all went out to drink beers. If this movie was indeed written around the actors, then the whole scenario makes sense, since this is very Sander heavy, but I think considering the scope of the movie and what it could have brought to the table, it leaves audiences feeling a bit unsatisfied. Perhaps extending the movie a bit, and throwing in a few more realistic character developments would have greatly helped draw audiences into the story. I found myself not caring about many of the aspects of the movie, because of the cheesy writing, but I will applaud the CGI that went into this movie, it's absolutely amazing what we are able to do, and they certainly went the extra mile to bring pixels to life. The way of defeating them was certainly unbelievable, and the fact that they were able to figure it out so fast was unbelievable. I think since the aliens were presenting them with the game, they would have also presented them with a tool to defeat them, so the light gun should have came from them, not the military. I also think the girl should have been taken for donkey kong, as it makes more sense. I dunno, there just seems to be odd writing choices through, but much of it I did enjoy regardless, I mean it's still an Adam Sander movie and for some reason we just can't get enough. at LEAST a 7, certainly not a 5.3 the current ratings are giving. This movie is certainly a throwback to kids from that time, so anyone between the ages of 25-35 should appreciate it.",Pixels

Was it for nostalgic adults, who find modern games hyper-violent and gory? I can't imagine either of those groups finding much of value in this movie. Since there was no effort at plot development, endearing or believable characters, or passable dialogue, I would have to vote for this as a ""kids"" movie. But, would if have been difficult to have at least *one* plot element consistent or plausible. Whether for kids or not, the acting was almost horrible beyond measure. The support acting crew does well, but Sandler can barely be bothered with the effort. He literally could have phoned in his lines via cell phone and saved himself or the studio the limousine fees.Why not a single star rating? I give it one above minimum for the graphics.

It's different from most Adam Sandler movies as it have heavy CGI but still had some solid laughs. It had some real good 1980s moments as the aliens not only used arcade games but when sending messages had clips of various 80s icons providing their message which added some funny moments. Like most Adam Sandler movies there was some interesting casting. I loved seeing Brian Cox and Sean Bean in a few scenes together bringing back memories of ""Sharpe's Eagle"". There was also a nice cameo from Serena Williams. The CGI was great and it was pretty original, not a rehash of the aliens blowing things up. I will definitely see it again.",Pixels

Nothing particular to note.However, I know it's not supposed to be serious, but there are some things that I wish would be more sensible. Trained soldiers can't even aim and hit a target properly, while a person untrained in the use of arms can just pick up a heavy weapon and nail everything because of ""video game experience"". Having ""cheat codes"" for an arcade game when it'd be impossible to even enter any on the console, and being able to even cheat without anyone spotting it when you have a mass audience. Just a few plot holes that you're just expected to go with because it's not a serious story. Otherwise, the film is perfect considering what kind of movie it is.What really made me gave this 10 points is the ending.

Of course it won't be the comedy we most adore. This film is different and deserves a chance on the shelf. When aliens intercept video feeds of classic arcade games and misinterpret them as a declaration of war, they attack Earth, using the games as models. Knowing that he must employ a similar strategy, President Will Cooper (Kevin James) recruits his childhood pal, former video-game champ and home-theater installer Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), to lead a team of old-school arcade players and a military specialist (Michelle Monaghan) in an all-out battle to save the planet.",Pixels

Good but not great direction from Chris Columbus and a funny script. As for the 3D, while it had proper depth, it didn't add too much, but the alien scenes(which account for about a third of the film) did benefit from it.Despite the fact the Adam Sandler is in this, it's one of Mr. Sandler's better films of late.

200,gspencley,Fun 80s nostalgia,7,26 September 2015,"So many people seemed determined to hate this movie before it was even released. I think it was mostly those who dislike Adam Sandler. Both the hate towards this movie and towards Adam Sandler are undeserved. Sandler has made some flops (Little Nicky, Jack & Jill), but he was also responsible for some comedy classics (Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, The Wedding Singer) and has shown that he's capable of more serious roles as well (Spanglish, Funny People). As far as Adam Sandler in this movie goes, it falls somewhere in the middle. Far removed from either his worst or his best roles. He wasn't the primary reason I enjoyed the movie, but he took nothing away from my enjoyment either. And perhaps that's how it should be. I don't remember feeling like I was being reminded that I was watching an Adam Sandler flick.We all know this movie was not intended as fine art and it's almost cliché to point that out when reviewing light-hearted comedies. The point is, I had a good time watching. The short Internet clip that inspired this movie was incredible, and seeing the idea expanded on was good fun. It won't change your life, but it will transport you back to 80s and give you some fun eye candy. One thing of note: I usually get to bored by long, drawn-out CGI action sequences, especially during climaxes. This is the first movie in a long time that had such a sequence during the climax that actually entertained me, and I think that means a lot. For me the movie would have been better had it's intended audience been adults. Some of the attempts at ""double entendre"" humour (i.e: jokes intended to entertain the adults yet be ""safe"" for kids) fell flat for me. But I understand that they wanted to make a family friendly movie, and that's what they did. Peter Dinklage was comedy gold.

The cartoony animation was absolutely great and made the characters fit in well with the real world.The comedy was hilarious! I found myself laughing very hard at times and it was just great, classic Happy Madison humor. Part of this was because of the acting which was great by the way. Everyone keeps saying that Adam Sandler is not funny anymore but I disagree. He still was funny at times to me and I thought he did good acting. Kevin James as the president was hysterical. Michelle Monaghan did great. But the two who were just hilarious and almost made you cry because they were so funny was Peter Dinklage and Josh Gad. They were so funny and the stuff they said and did was totally laugh out loud funny.Surprisingly, the action in this movie was really good.

Independence Day this is not, so don't go looking for anything serious here... this is a COMEDY! If there's a moment they can interject 80's nostalgia... they're going to do it. And they did with style I have to say.The plot was simple... like an old arcade game... three tries and you're safe. Still not sure how the 'cheating' was done... but when you 'see' the codes... they are all various codes for home games- I think. Saw a glimpse of the Konami code in there too! Trying not to spoil too much. Will say the comedy had me laughing. My little girl got many of the jokes too. The action was pretty cool, and made you just want to jump in a join the silly antics. Now the bad... some of the adult jokes did seem a bit much for a mixed audience, and younger kids. Now, when Dinklage mentioned the 2 girl sandwich... I HAD to laugh when we see the women he wanted to see and... yes, they had a sandwich in hand! The best pun of the WHOLE movie. Yes, one guy ""gets the girl."" But I hate to say, she wasn't a 'girl' to begin with... and it was a lifetime fatuation... it was weird, and even Sandler's character made a funny comment about it too. Some may have object to it... but again, it just bad humor, which was actually funny and is the cause for the follow up scene in the credit. You can NOT take this movie too seriously.Now the REAL bad. Josh Gad... he should NOT have been in this film. When the trailers were shown months ago... my little girl was excited because she KNEW he voiced Olaf... well, Olaf he AIN'T and he makes Sandler's comedy seem classy. He was the wrong age, the wrong comedy, and just all around would have been a better film without the terrible, the lewd, and the wrong: Josh Gad. If he screamed one more time or showed his crack another time... I'd have left the theater.Overall the movie IS enjoyable and plenty of game CGI eye candy for all to see. And that's where the real gems in this movie are. The game characters! Q-Bert actually talks - which took some time to get used to. But Pac Man had some personality, so did Donkey Kong, and some of the others. Many details to take in all at once, is why I actually suggest a second viewing, just for the details alone. Yeah, the plot line is thin, but it's fun. Yeah, they could have blasted the ship out of the sky I guess... but where's the fun in that? It's silly, it's fun, it's a visual treat. Ignore Josh Bad, and enjoy the movie! I might have given it a higher rating had Gad not been in it. And people are complaining about Sandler!?

225,fuzzhead72,pretty good movie to watch with kids,10,4 September 2015,"I've been hooked on video games, especially the classic ones, since I played Space Invaders, Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Wizard of Wor, Frogger, Donkey Kong (etc., etc., etc.) at the arcades from the late 70's through mid 80's, and of course on home systems afterwards. My kids have played many of these classic arcade games on MAME and on compilation disks on the Gamecube. We absolutely loved Wreck It Ralph, so when I heard that there was another video game themed movie coming out, I was looking forward to watching it.I wasn't able to get to the theater for the first month, but then it was showing at a local drive-in as the second feature. I went to watch it with my oldest son, who is not quite a teen yet. We were pretty bored by the first feature, which was a failed attempt to reboot yet another 60's TV show. However, Pixels really captured our attention, and we both loved the humor and the video game action.I could have done without the reference to Martha Stewart that they put in there, and I would have liked to see maybe 4 or 5 more classic video games featured. I also would have liked for there to be some form of personal appearance by the alien A.I. in charge. Overall, however, I think it was the most fun my son and I had watching a movie this summer, and we've watched more than a dozen. After we watched it, he came home and played a bunch of the old video games for a few hours. I finally bought Pac Man Championship Edition DX+.It certainly isn't a blockbuster, but with the international box office, it will finish at about 2.5 times its budget, so it will ultimately be another profitable movie. Is it the greatest movie of the year? No, but it would be a good choice for anybody who has played classic arcade games through the mid 80's.",Pixels
226,starry42,"Enjoyable, as long as you're in the target audience.",7,25 July 2015,"So far this decade, Adam Sandler has churned out one awful movie after another. From ""Jack & Jill"" to ""That's My Boy"", his efforts at entertainment have been atrocious. Then along comes ""Pixels"", which shows possible signs of redemption for Mr. Sandler.""Pixels"" is simply an enjoyable and fun day at the cinema, and it does not try to be anything more. Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad, and Peter Dinklage team up as four video game experts who come from different walks of life. Sandler is a TV installer, James is the president of the United States, Gad is a conspiracy theorist, and Dinklage is a criminal. They are called to order when an alien race sends down attack squadrons in the form of classic video game characters. From Pac-Man to Donkey Kong, it appears that the world is headed for a disaster of pixelated proportions. Can Sandler and his gang save the world, or is it game over?Director Chris Columbus, who wrote classic 80s films like ""Gremlins"" and ""The Goonies"" and directed classics like ""Home Alone"" and the first two Harry Potter films, did a great job at bringing all these characters to life. The effects look pretty impressive, and the chemistry among the actors is certainly believable. Bottom line, I enjoyed the film as both a gamer and a sucker for 80s pop-culture, which there is plenty of referenced. In the end, I would recommend it to those with these similar taste. It is certainly not a movie for everyone.",Pixels
227,j-lindsay-sens,It had its pros and cons,6,29 September 2015,"So, i skipped the theater, and thankfully so. This movie is not worth the cost (most movies arnt nowadays anyways), but this movie was really not that good. I love Adam, and some of his movies are my favourite all time (water boy, Bed Time stories, Little Nicky), but this movie is not high up on that list for me. The movie of course had its saving moments, and i did laugh quite a bit, and i enjoyed most of it, but overall, the movie was terrible.So the movie plot is: in the 80's, a group of friends loved arcade games, and one of the boys (Adam Sandler) became one of the best in the world, before loosing to Peter Dinklage. At this event, NASA had recorded the arcade games and sent it into space in hopes of communicating with aliens. Fast forward to present times, the friends have all moved on, one became a conspiracy nut, one became the president, and Adam became a software installation specialist. However one day, aliens land on Earth and challenge the humans to an arcade like game, using old arcade games, for the fate of the world and these friends must unit together once again to save Earth.So the pros: I liked the movie, it was very fun, had some good action, extremely good CGI when it came to the video game characters (i thought the centipede was awesome looking),the soundtrack was pretty awesome and combined with the action was very ""pump up"", the jokes were often on que, and the idea of Kevin James as President was beyond hilarious.Cons: The movie lacked any real depth, but it didn't aim to, the dialog between characters was often painful to watch and too corny, the forced love connection with the main characters, the massive amount of plot holesOverall: I liked this movie, it will surely become a cult classic, and it was fun to watch at home on a Sunday night on TV, but i wouldn't recommend buying it. I personally wouldn't reject it as a gift, but i wouldn't go out and buy it myself unless it was $5. From an actually technical movie perspective, it was lousy and deserves a 5. whatever it is, if not less. But don't let that fool you, because if you don't take it seriously, it was a fun movie. As an overall movie, it should be a 5.0, judging it based on what it was made to be, probably an 7.0...so i took the middle ground, and gave it a 6.0",Pixels
228,filmguru11,Pixels Movie Review,7,22 July 2015,"NASA sends a message containing video games, footage from old T.V. shows, and interviews from celebrities like Madonna into space, to communicate with intelligent life forms, who misinterpret them as a declaration of war. The aliens thereafter attack Earth as pixelized versions of characters from popular 80's arcade games.Adam Sandler along with Kevin James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage star in the sci-fi comedy Pixels, portraying former arcade game champs, called upon to save the planet from the attacking video game characters of the 80's. The film utilizes nostalgia and video games to its advantage to develop an emotional connection with the audience wholived during that era, as well as connecting with the current generation.The comic timing from Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad were spot on. The actors were right in their comfort zone and honestly attempting exactly what was expected of them. Peter Dinklage was also good but there were times where his loud egoistic character was just plain annoying. Michelle Monaghan rounds up the loud ensemble group playing the strong single mother and White House military adviser. The special effects were wonderful and the video game characters with their vibrant colors looked fantastic. The gamer within was particularly overjoyed to see characters from popular games like Pac-Man, Donkey Kong and Centipede. Other lesser known games like Tetris and Asteroids are also portrayed and will take audience members back to the memorable time they spent playing arcade games. A blink and miss shot of Toru Iwatani (creator of Pac- Man) during the opening sequence, will have fanatics ecstatic. Later in the movie a lovely tribute is bestowed upon Iwatani, thanking him for giving the world one of the most popular games of all time.Pixels overall is a fun ride if you just sit back and try not to analyze the film for what it really is – light-hearted entertainment that does not go over the top. It may seem nonsensical, but it is enjoyable and a cool blast from the past.",Pixels

As an actor, he has a very negative and annoying screen presence. I read reviews of this film and it got slated.. I mean I think critics rated human centipede more and my god I was dreading seeing it but my boy wanted to see it and I thought 'why deny him because I think it's going to be dreadful!'.... apart from sandlers lazy acting and same personality as all films this movie was great! The effects even got completely dismissed by so called critics!! They were beautiful... the best you can do with graphics this day and age in regards to pixels! There was stereotyping... typical ""America saves the world again!!"" And some silly gags... bit it was enough to keep me entertained. There is simply a firing squad out for Sandler and I'm starting to feel a little sorry for him as I was one of them, this film was a gamble in my eyes and it should have paid off. CRITICS ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT!! I have learned that now so shame on me! Go and see it... for those that are saying this is the worst film EVER, have you not seen house of the dead???

We laughed the whole time. If you are one of those people who like movies like that, you will love this movie. I would not drag your average non-sci-fi person to this movie. They just won't get it. I am not sure if people who did not grow up in the 80's will get it either, possibly? There were a lot of pop-culture references from that era and that made it all the more funny. The cameo's were great and the actors chose to play in the movie were great and great together. I love Adam Sandler, and Peter Dinklage was by far the funniest character in the whole movie.

But in the end my best friend Sven went to see it with his friends instead. I only went to see this at first because I was curious to see Peter Dinklage's performance. By the end of the movie I really had a great time. Yes, it feels like a Happy Gilmore movie yet surprisingly there is little of that probably because of Chris Columbus' direction. Sandler wasn't that much of a hyperactive moron, Kevin James played it cool, Monaghan was hot, Josh Gad got all the embarrassing lines and Dinklage was to me the highlight of the movie. Eddie Plant is probably one of the most bad ass characters in comedy. The fights between the nerds and the video game characters were beautiful, there are some great shots. In the end, this movie just like BvS doesn't deserve the hate for no apparent reason (the reason for this one being just because it is a Happy Gilmore production) and you should consider watching this only when you are free on the weekend. Also that ending was so funny I almost fell down.",Pixels

There was no 'boring' bits for either of us and loads of laugh-out-loud moments.My highlight was the small Dan Akroyd cameo near the beginning and I especially loved the scene in the bar a bit later on when Adam Sandler whips out a bottle of Akroyd's crystal head vodka - the best, most subliminal bit of product placement I have ever seen in a movie.

I am sorry if you are watching this movie for a plot, YOU ARE AT THE WRONG MOVIE, easy like that, plot suck, jokes fail to be fun and this is true.

My only dislike is though her role was small Ashley Benson had no lines what so ever, would have been nice to have some kind of battle cry or whatever from her. I feel she could have at least have some spoken words in the movie, she is one of my favorite actresses but her overall appearance was enough for me.

242,wjets9,Career Saving Movie?,10,23 July 2015,"When I first saw the trailer for this movie I thought it looked absolutely amazing... then Adam Sandler showed up. This immediately tempered my expectations for this film, but it had a fantastic plot, and enough actors/actresses that I still was pretty excited for it. What I watched absolutely blew me away.The basic premise of the movie is this: an attempted communication with aliens is taken as a threat of war, and so they attack earth using the very games they were sent footage of. In order to defeat them and save earth, a group of people who were video game champions as kids are called upon to save the planet.As previously mentioned, I loved some of the acting choices for this movie. Ashley Benson is a personal favorite, and despite only having very limited screen time, and not actually saying a single word, she delivers a very strong performance as Lady Lisa. Peter Dinklage is most known for his role on Game of Thrones, but I personally know him from the horror comedy Knights of Badassdom. Previously I knew him as a vulgar, ""out there"" comedy actor, but in this film he manages to tone it down enough to make it a (mostly) family friendly performance, while still maintaining the edge that I love about him. This was actually my first time seeing Michelle Monaghan, and I didn't know Josh Gad too well, but both of them (in particular Gad) had more than noteworthy performances.Now finally for the biggest question mark of the film, Sandler. As the title I put to the review indicates, I believe this has the potential to be a career saving movie for him. I have previously only truly enjoyed him 3 times, the latest being The Longest Yard, and before that in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison. More recently I have wasted money going to the theatres to see his films, and even seeing what I consider to be the 2 worst movies I've ever seen in theatre in Funny People, and Jack and Jill. But he delivers a great performance here, and has made a step in earning my trust back in movies.Overall, I'm not trying to say the film is without flaw, but then again not many films are. This is a very fun movie, and will keep you entertained the entire time. I give this movie a 10/10.",Pixels
243,Mohrwyn,"Not a great, but still a nice movie",7,11 December 2016,"For a movie that seems to be intended mostly for kids, it really has some entertainment. Although I fear that the intended audience won't understand the fun of all the Arcade stuff...So, given the fact that the main ingredient of the movie will only fully appeal those who actually played those games back in the 80's, I also have to review this from my point of view (yep, I've played several of those games, back then).The setting, story-telling and acting is really not to my taste. It's kind of weird, all together. But.. that said: the recognizing of all those Arcane heroes, the way they are part of the movie, the fun quotes the characters have here and there and the chase to get rid all the Arcane stuff, it's actually pretty fun to watch.No, I don't think I'll see it ever again. But after the first 15 minutes of pretty bland movie-time, it somehow catches enough to not only see it through the end, but I even felt like I had a good time. I can imagine that kids can have a lot of fun watching this movie and it'll probably be a really nice family-movie.",Pixels

This movie brought back memories some good, some bad. The scene with the girl scouts was typical female in that they started screaming at the President when he corrected one of the girl scouts that was being a brat. The main problems arose with Josh Gad's character when he started screaming like a rabid homo and later at the end when the offspring looked like little Q-berts. Babies with some sort of special abilities (shape changing, etc. like in ""Son of the mask"") would have been fine but the two humans having baby Q-berts was a stupid. I had actually considered adding this movie to the collection for later viewing when it's released but with Josh Gad's one weird scene and the Q-bert babies I doubt I will get it.",Pixels

Do all movies have to be the same basic story line in order for the critics to like them? This movie definitely brings back memories for those of us born in the 80's. Yes, there are a few ridiculous scenes in the movie, as is often the case in fun,comedy movies, but overall, the acting is fine, and watching the games come to life is exciting. In my opinion, it is definitely worth the watch. Sit back, relax and enjoy the imagination and fun put into the movie, while sipping a glass of wine. :D Sometimes it is better to see for yourself than to trust the critics.

But after the first fight, I found the whole thing to just be a bit silly, with only occasional parts that I laughed at. It started throwing in subplots that you really don't care much about and continually trying to be ""serious"", when it really comes off as being melodramatic and stupid. With better direction, I feel like this movie could have been saved, and believe it or not, MIGHT have boosted Adam Sandlar's career, which clearly, hasn't been very good lately.

252,smashtheelder,A better tribute to the arcades than Wreck-It Ralph,6,14 November 2016,"Pixels was better than I expected. My brother loves Adam Sandler, so he's dragged me through some pretty bad movies. But Pixels was okay. It would be good for kids and people who like classic video games and are also sympathetic to the Happy Madison style of film making. Certainly, there are worse ways to spend an hour and forty five minutes.As a homage to arcade games, it far surpasses the otherwise decent Wreck-It Ralph. The problem with Ralph was that it used video games as window dressing to tell the well-worn story of the outsider who finds meaning and self-respect. Pixels actually works the video game motif into the storyline such that the story wouldn't work without it.Some people seem to have problems with how unlikely the plot is and how far-fetched many of the bits in the movie are. It's really not a problem. The movie signposts at several points that it is not to be taken seriously, usually in the form of a character verbally noticing the illogic. Normally, this kind of dialogue irritates me, since it is rarely funny, but it was done well here, especially because the things being commented on needed to be commented on.The movie made me laugh a couple of times and was rarely unpleasant. It lacks the onslaught of juvenile sex jokes that categorise and ruin many of Adam Sandler's other movies. It managed to pass the threshold of being acceptable entertainment. Which makes it one of the best Adam Sandler films I have yet seen.On that note, it seemed like Sandler was putting a bit of himself into his character. Both were promising talents in their younger days, but squandered that talent and became undistinguished presences in their neighbourhoods by middle age. Unlike his character, I doubt that Pixels signifies a reflowering for Sandler, since there mustn't be much motive for him to do better than his lowest common denominator comedies. Still, perhaps he can surprise us one day...",Pixels

It would probably appear somewhat stupid even to small children.If i had to describe it in one sentence, it would be: It was the most stupid, obnoxious, full of plot holes and more than full of clichés movie.

254,tails234,Could have been a LOT worse.,3,27 July 2015,"Now I am going to just say that I am not a fan of Adam Sandler. While, I'm sure, a nice guy I just can not get behind his comedy style of poop and pee jokes with some sexual references. So when I heard that good ol' Adam and his regular crew of Kevin James (Paul Blart), Peter Dinklige (of Game of Thrones fame) and Josh Gad (Olaf from 'Frozen') were creating a Video Game based film I was suckered in to checking it out. The plot is Video Games take over, not going to make the 'Futurama' comparison. Of course though, unless you saw the trailer you probably wouldn't know WHY the aliens take over. Sadly they only have a few lines in the script that explain why they attack. Now this isn't really a problem if you saw the trailers, but if you are going into this blind viewers may be confused. As it goes on it just becomes a big pile of clichés that does make way for some interesting battles and references but really doesn't stick. I was surprised when I started laughing a bit. Not often (yes there is the obligatory Happy Madison touch with a few pee, poo and sex jokes) but enough to make myself happy. Something about Adam's cocky personality in this that really makes most of his character jabs something to laugh at. Good enough but could have been better. Now facts. They got a few video game facts wrong. Firstly, I won't spoil it here, but once you see it you will realize the problem especially since these are arcade games. Additionally according to the plot they sent the space thing in 1983 or so. Mario (8-bit NES sprite) didn't exist and in the background during one of the battles he is there. Also, Donkey Kong didn't have set stages like shown in the intro so that's wrong. And there are many other little errors but I won't waste your time here. And the Sony product placements? Don't get me started on that! Overall I am shocked at the rating. Even me, the Happy Madison Production hating self enjoyed this movie more then I thought. Will I watch it again? Maybe.

Of course, it has some problems, but take my advice, it's better than Grown-Ups and Jack and Jill (I haven't seen those movies but I'm sure they'll be terrible).So, what are the things I like about Pixels? First off, is of course, the concept. The concept is so original and inventive. There are many alien invading movies out there but this movie does the unusual way, using video-game characters to ""pixelate"" everything in their path. The visuals and the action in this movie are quite well-done. It is a bit funny at some parts of the movie. This might be a rare and special praise here but I think it's fast paced.What about the problems? The first problem is that the characters in this movie are kind of weak and forgettable. Before I get to criticism about the story, I want to say like how the plot suggests. Anyway, the problem with the story is that it has some confusing points like there's a Smurf in the movie. Why is the their a Smurf if the invaders only used video-game characters? The biggest problem about the story though is that it's overwhelmingly predictable thanks to the footage of the trailers. Lastly, there are some jokes I didn't really get.Despite having plot confusions and weak characters, Pixels, in my opinion, is an okay summer experience with great visuals, good action and some humour. One thing for certain, you'll probably find this movie better than Grown-Ups and Jack and Jill but don't enjoy this movie too much if you're suffering Sandler's potential.Film Score: 6/10 - Okay",Pixels
259,alexfinlayson-80821,Visually impressive but overall below average,5,18 May 2018,"Pixels looked to be a very interesting film when the trailer first dropped. But, upon hearing how poorly it was doing, I avoided seeing it. When it on came TV earlier this year, I decided to give it a go. I think enjoyed it more than most people did but it was obvious why it had been criticized so much.Many people have said it would have been better if Adam Sandler hadn't been in the lead role. I partly agree with that statement but I believe the films biggest problem is it's script. The story has a very unique concept (based on Patrick Jean's short film) but if it had just been scripted better, then it may have been more successful. There were multiple moments in the film where I found myself saying 'really?'. I must admit I found myself shouting in disbelief at a few of the scenes involving Josh Gad's character towards the end; I personally think this was a pretty poor performance from him. Plus hearing Q*Bert speak English wasn't quite right either. If he'd spoken the same way he did in Wreck-It-Ralph then it might have been better. And that post-credit scene was, to put it quite simply, wrong.But the film wasn't all bad. The story is very original, the special effects are brilliant, the few gags that the film has are quite funny, Peter Dinklage's acting is top quality as ever and the final battle set to 'We Will Rock You' is very enjoyable.All in all, it's a long way off being the worst film I've ever seen but, equally, it's even further away from being the best.",Pixels

266,r_tripleus,The magic of arcade games is lost,5,30 July 2015,"The start of the movie was very nostalgic. The viewers who grew up in the 80s and 90s would most likely agree. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Space invaders. All these arcade games just flash by you. The arcade too is named ""Electric Games"". The promise the movie showed during the starting few minutes is immediately lost. We see President Cooper (played by Kevin James) and Brenner (by Adam Sandler) involved in silly discussions. It may have been done to show the president as a very friendly person but what it does is shows him as a silly guy you would meet on the streets. President Cooper has turned the White House into more like a public picnic area.Violet (by Michelle Monahagan) is simply splendid in her opening scene. The makers of the movie could have given Violet more importance and more screen time. She is good in bits and pieces when she appears. The same with Eddy (by Peter Dinklage). Eddy just doesn't stand out. His flamboyance and flair are neither goofy nor stupid.Parts of the movie still do make you sit up and enjoy. For instance when Matty asks Brenner if classic games mean Counter Strike, a surprised Brenner replies 'no'. And when the Admiral was trying to blame Iran and Moscow, it does put a smile on your face. I believe aliens were brilliantly done. You get to see them communicate directly with the earthlings, but never see a green or double headed creature with tentacles.With all the war against the aliens you fail to understand what the director wants to deliver. If it was to make the current generation kids understand the simplicity of the arcade games or make the adults feel nostalgic about their childhood. The movie fails on both accounts.",Pixels

Whenever you hear the name Adam Sandler on a movie you think It's probably going to be bad, but that's not always true and this is one of the examples. Just like anyone else I am shocked to find Peter Dinklage in this movie, how did he get from Game of Thrones to this. The special effects in this movie were pretty good.

Some of the action like the pacman scene being watched on the computer was kind of cheesy. It just didn't give a wow factor and i think the movie really could have done that. But for a new style of movie, it was a good shot and thumbs up to everyone involved. Unfortunately this is not a film I will be seeing again though. Once is enough.

Comedy (though better than most bad Adam Sandler comedies),3,25 July 2020,"This is one of the worst movies of 2015 (albeit not as bad as Fifty Shades of Grey or FANT4STIC).Let's start off with the good, the action is solid, the soundtrack is awesome, the CGI is amazing compared to other Happy Madison Productions films, and it is funnier than most modern Sandler comedies. Not to mention its premise being incredibly clever.Now, the bad: The acting is beyond lazy. Sure it's not as bad as Jack and Jill, but it's still pretty lazy. Now, Sandler's character (Sam Brenner) is quite unlikable, as he is a cliched character who is lazy and hates his job. Josh Gad's character (Ludlow Lamonsoff) takes his obsession towards a female video game character to the extreme. Peter Dinklage's character, Eddie Plant is very unlikable and cliched as he trashes anyone who does worse than him. The jokes are just lazy and crappy, such as Q*bert urinating in the Donkey Kong battle. We haven't even gotten to the worst part yet: The ending. (sigh). So basically, Ludlow falls in love with Lady Lisa, who was the only video game character who turned into a human, but after Brenner, Will Cooper (Kevin James' character), Q*bert and Violet successfully defeat the aliens, Lady Lisa is returned to the mothership, and since they keep their trophies, Q*bert stays and turns into Lady LisaI really wanted to like this movie.

293,scottda-42226,Ruined by Adam Sandler and bad attempts at comedy,2,8 October 2015,"Let me say the good things in the movie first. And admittedly there were several things I enjoyed in it (hence the 2/10 instead of 1/10). For a start the visual effects were very good, and made for some very fun action sequences. I enjoyed the scenes with Peter Dinklage very much. He was definitely the stand-out performance. Also the opening sequence was very well shot and captured the spirit of classic 80's arcades perfectly.Now onto the problems with the movie. For a start, the movie doesn't seem to know who its audience is. It appears to be a kids movie, with lots of childish humor and a PG rating. But there are so many references to 80's pop-culture icons and games that most of the movie makes little sense to anyone born after 1982. Also there is a fair amount of low-level swearing and some very sexual references so I wouldn't really feel comfortable showing it to a child.The cinema I watched Pixels in was nearly full, yet literally no one laughed at all during the entire movie. That made for an extremely awkward 100 or so minutes. Now how about the cast? Well:Josh Gads character spends much of his screen time yelling obnoxiously in attempted humor (I think) but it is just uncomfortable.Michelle Monaghan is too good for this movie. That's all. Kevin James is unfunny in this as POTUS. His humor consists of him knocking over things and generally being an idiot. I already covered Peter Dinklage. His performance was excellent and helped earn that extra star from me.Adam Sandler was doing his usual lazy, unfunny acting style. The story of him winning over Michelle Monaghan is completely unbelievable to the point where literally no one cares whether he gets the girl or not.

The movie sucks, but the reason it sucks is because of Adam Sandler, who obviously uses his position to make movies as a way to vomit his misogynistic, out of touch, OK boomer and anti progressive old man opinions every time his character opens his mouth. I also have a sneaking suspicion that he made this movie (and probably countless others) with the sole purpose of getting to make out with a pretty lady, because who would want to do that with him unless they're getting paid a couple million for it? Does that technically make the leading actress a... Poor girl. Anyways the movie is a fascinating look into how the man is obviously incredibly insecure and has been ridiculed or insulted by military men, who he puts in their place here by the way. The man likely has nothing he's good at except a few old video games which he hangs onto and in this movie gets to make him into a hero, respected by the world and getting him the girl.

The story line was amusing and funny. The performances of the cast were spot on. The humor was tastefully done so that the parents will get some good laughs while the kids are laughing more at what is going on then what was being said.This is one movie that I would not mind going to see again while it is in the theaters should the chance come up. And I will certainly be adding it to my DVD library soon as it is released.,Pixels
300,mridu2903,All in all it's entertaining and will make you nostalgic,6,3 January 2016,"So I recently saw this film with my 13 year old brother and totally loved it. I am a little disappointed with the storyline though, but hey this made me laugh so it's okay. Josh Gad did an amazing job, VFX were great. Oh i really wish they included Super Mario somehow and I wanted them to include the childhood time more, it would have added more meat to the story, that is how we could have seen the character development. The film could have a had a greater value to it, if they just took the Idea of how when someone fails at the thing they think they excel at,they think they aren't worthy of anything. They could have not involved the cheat part as of then and made the protagonist realize it's okay to loose sometimes - because that's what you call being sporty- isn't it? I wish and hope the cheat part was revealed later when he got victory in Donkey Kong. Such cute alien invasion that I want them to attack us for real and leave us those cute alien things. ;) I got film to spend time on.",Pixels

303,rancky,Pretty awful movie with pretty CGI,2,1 August 2015,"l came into watching this movie hearing from others that this was another bad Adam Sandler movie, others saying it was a great movie and thoroughly enjoyed it and that they grew up with video games seen in the movie. First off l would like to say that nostalgia ≠ good movie. And l must say, Adam Sandler was just being Adam Sandler, however he was not the only factor of the movie that made this absolutely awful, it was also the absolute crap writing, the stupid premises, the lazy sequences, just everything you could name in a bad movie, here it is. The only reason l am giving this film a 2 star, is because 1 star is the lowest you can go, and 1 extra star for the CGI. The CGI and compositing in this movie is spot on, and it looks great, that at least l can appreciate. The movie starts out to introduce the premise of the story and our protagonist, and than hard cuts you into the 'current time' where our world starts suddenly being attacked by various classic video games. Each of those video game sequences are done so well in CGI, but resolved so HORRIBLY lazy. lt's hard to explain, but basically l had to force myself to finish this film, l couldn't stand watching it and l wanted it to be over so badly, and even the end wasn't satisfying for the viewers. The credits were cute, but that still plays more on CG. Don't waste your time unless you want cheap (AND I MEAN EXTREMELY CHEAP) laughs and want to stare at some cool CGI. Most of other people that will say this was a good movie, are blinded by nostalgia and CGI. What lies beneath is an extremely lazily written piece of garbage movie script that has wasted a genuinely good movie concept. (and no, the rating has nothing to do with Sandler, l came into watching this movie with low expectations)",Pixels

Why is it always that these ass-holes think that making fun of dwarfs and other vulnerable people is so fun? Then they take this dwarf and use him throughout this movie - from the beginning to the end - in the hope of making the audience laugh, but all they did was to make a fool out of themselves. Disgusting! In short, this movie is offensive and filled with black humour.Beside the dwarf clown, all characters in this movie are highly likable. And the visual effects are also good.",Pixels

Anyways, this movie was a fun movie. It has such an amazing plot and the special affects were the best I've ever seen. I just think Adam could've tried harder. He is obviously capable of amazing things its just that he needs to try more. Id say it was worth my time and money, its concept was freaking amazing! If everyone tried their complete hardest, this movie would have been a Smash Hit. In my opinion Adam is a very funny guy and I just love that he wont quit making movies. I just loved how pacman looked and the whole idea of the small cars as the ghosts, it was just straight genius",Pixels
306,IsaacfromUSA,Ignore the brainwashed haters who did not even see this great film.,10,25 July 2015,"In 1982 in the hopes of establishing peaceful communication with extraterrestrial life, NASA launches a time capsule into outer space containing images and footage of Earth life and culture. However, the aliens misinterpret enclosed video-feeds of classic arcade games as a declaration of war. They attack the Earth using the games as models for their various assaults including Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Space Invaders, Arkanoid and Tetris. Their technology creates voxels that change form and are capable of turning any form of matter into more of itself. President Will Cooper (Kevin James) calls upon his best friend since childhood, former video game professional Sam Brenner (Adam Sandler), who is now a home theater installer and had a previous relationship with Cooper's wife (Jane Krakowski). To combat the video game characters, Brenner decides to lead a team of retrogamers Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and Ludlow Lamonsoff (Josh Gad) to defeat the aliens with technology similar to those used in games.Pixels is a great 2015 American science fiction comedy film all people must see.

307,MisachiMoon,A waste of time.,2,11 August 2015,"To all of you who say this movie is good, it's not. This movie is a money maker, Adam Sandler picked something that is loved by almost every parent, teenagers and some children, Arcade games, to squeeze your wallets and beg for money. The characters are nothing new, Adam Sandler plays himself in this movie, just like every other actor, Peter Dinklage is the only that tries to make a new character but still fails.Yes, the awesome arcade characters are here, and that's the only thing this movie's good for, but they are in the movie for 25 minutes! I went to see Pixels waiting for a good story with some decent jokes or just some time to watch what they did with these legendary characters, and they fail.The jokes are awful, i only laughed once or twice and it was because of the plot holes of this story, did they watch this when they were done shooting? This is a summer blockbuster that will be forgotten very soon without any cool or memorable scenes. And basically the directors just waste our time with an Adam Sandler's horrible romance when we could have had awesome action, boss battles, Space invaders sky battle or something! this movie should be called ""Adam Sandler and some games"". And don't try to understand some parts of the movie, you wont get answers of what the hell just happened, maybe they though a ""comedy"" shouldn't have a story at all and they put this excuse to make some money.Nintendo tried to redeem itself from the horrible ""Super Mario Bros."" but now they have 2 movies not worth watching or even remembering. This movie is a straight 3/10 not recommended, don't waste your money on it, you should watch it later when it's free just to see how bad it is and why Adam Sandler can't make good movies like he used to.",Pixels
308,dustin-31007,Pathetic,1,15 August 2015,"Adam Sandler and crew don't even try to pretend to try anymore. This film is so bad, that I don't even know if Rifftrax/MST3K would be able to do anything with it. I believe the reviews on the first two pages of reviews are either fake, or paid for by the studio to desperately try to compensate for how bad this film was trashed by critics and users alike. Notice that almost all of them follow the same pattern of saying things like ""don't believe the reviews / don't trust the critics / etc."" I'd be very suspicious of all those reviews. Think about it, how would a film get so universally trashed by critics and fans alike, and then suddenly there are a bunch of recent 10 star reviews--very suspicious. I don't always care for critics either, but in this case, they are absolutely right . . . this film stinks big-time.The scene where Sandler's love interest is introduced is so flat and predictable, it literally would have been better if Sandler just looked right into the camera and said to the audience: ""is it cool if you all just accept that this is gonna be my love interest in the film, that just happens to also be an adviser to the president? Yes? O.K. so we can skip this scene? Good. Moving on . . ."" The scene where Kevin James is introduced as Sandler's . . . 80's buddy who's now a business man? nope . . . 80's buddy who's now a video game executive? nope . . . 80's buddy who's now THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?!?! yep . . . you read that right . . . Kevin James just gets casually introduced as PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! This scene is so pathetically unbelievable that I couldn't even fathom how awful it was.Keep in mind that I was a fan of Sandler's earlier work, especially Wedding Singer, SNL, and even up to 50 First Dates, when he actually still tried and made an effort. He literally didn't even lift a finger's worth of effort in this atrocity. He doesn't even pretend to try anymore. Also keep in mind that I did like the initial concept of the 80's time capsule being found and the games brought to life as weapons.I believe that Sandler and crew (i.e. James, et al) simply just decide where they want their next group paid vacation / party to be: New York, London, African Safari (i.e. Blended), etc. etc., have someone write a really cheap, undeveloped excuse for a plot/script, plug in actors from their crew and or friends/relatives of theirs they want to give a shot at stardom, and go on their group vacation / party while kinda/sorta making a movie at the same time.Dinklage makes an effort, but the writers make his character so stupid and one dimensional that it is almost a miracle that he was able to do anything with it.The only other actor who makes an effort in this film is Josh Gad, and he has the only genuinely funny scene in the movie where he gets to give a bunch of Navy Seals the ""Drill Sergeant"" treatment.Other than that 45 seconds, this film is pathetic. Probably in my top 10 worst movies I've ever seen list.",Pixels

312,GWShark,Not a review but a complete walk-through if you really want to watch it.,3,17 October 2015,"This movie is tough to watch but if you really want to give it a try I'll help you.First, choose your mode.Easy mode: Renting this movie. You can always pause and take a break.Normal mode: Recommended if you are skilled in watching shitty movies. Buying it will cost you 15 bucks, but you can still pause.Hardcore mode: Go, see this movie in a theater, but remember, you can't pause. If you leave, you have to start from the beginning. Choose this if you are a veteran shitty movie-goer and you think you can deal with Adam Sandler, Kevin James and Josh Gad at the same time.Ready? Here we go. The first level is pretty easy. It's just bunch of kids playing arcade games and entering a video game tournament in 1982. With the sweet feeling of nostalgia and the help of your first NPC, (Dan Aykroyd) you will clear this stage with ease.Kids grow up, Kevin James becomes the US President, Adam Sandler becomes a nerd who installs hardware. He meets Michelle Monaghan while installing game consoles for her son. They instantly start telling everything to each other for no reason and they almost make out. (because they're both getting divorced or the screenwriter decided to lift this part of the script from the last porn movie he has seen) BTW Adam Sandler doesn't play a complete moron in this movie for a change so his scenes are a bit easier to watch than normal. He is not funny and he doesn't even try to be. He just bores you to death in each of his scenes so be prepared.In a cut-scene, aliens attack Guam. They are in retro video game forms and everything they attack turns into pixels (Actually voxels, since they are 3D, but who cares) So the president does the most logical thing and calls his childhood arcade buddy.You will find your second NPC (Brian Cox) where the government officials try to figure out what's going on. His lines are not funny, but he is a great actor. You will need his talent if you wanna finish this movie. Here is a good trick. In some scenes, he doesn't even talk but there is always a surprised or angry look on his face. Just imagine him saying ""WTF am I doing in this movie?"" This will perfectly match his facial expression all the time and amuse you more than the movie itself.Save your progress and get ready for the first boss battle. Josh Gad will do a sneak attack but don't worry. He is annoying as hell but not in his true form yet. Just try to ignore him when he is simply narrating the plot of the movie (twice) Right after that, get ready for your first tough battle and prepare your ears to be molested by him. He will use his ""yelling for no reason"" attack for over 2 mins. He will insult/compliment to soldiers in a never ending, unfunny, uninteresting, unnecessary scene. This is the first time where I lost a life. (or paused the movie and think about what the hell I am doing with my life) If I was watching this movie in hardcore mode, this scene would be my ""game over, man! game over!"" moment.Sean Bean will show up soon enough and instantly prove that he is a valuable NPC by telling Josh Gad to shut up. Special effects in the Centipede attack scene is quite good and shiny objects always make me forget about all the clichés I see. If you are like me, you can take a breath and prepare yourself for the next level. Still 55 mins to go, so don't let your guard down.When you see the great Peter Dinklage, you may think he can save your ass at first, but just give him a few mins and he will prove that he is actually a boss monster too. He does his best with the given material, but his character is boring and super predictable.The movie wants us to believe that scientists already predicted that Pac-man may be a bad guy and our nerds get ghost cars already prepared for them. Don't worry, there is more shiny stuff so just stare at the screen and try not to think much. It will be over soon.During a boring party scene, we find out that Peter Dinklage pulled a Joffrey Baratheon on us and cheated during the Pac-man battle. Now, the world is under attack and by the world I mean Washington DC, obviously. Get ready for the final battle.One of the aliens takes the form of Lady Lisa and gets close to killing Josh Gad, but she blows it and robs us from the chance of getting rid of him. More shiny stuff gets blown up and our nerds get an invite to the mothership for a final showdown. Adam Sandler beats Donkey Kong as the most anticlimactic way as possible and saves the world.The defeated aliens leave us a world where Adam Sandler boinks Michelle Monaghan; Kevin James is married to Jane Krakowski, Peter Dinklage gets a threesome with Serena Williams and Martha Stewart; Josh Gad makes 4 kids with Ashley Benson. Yeah, let that sink in.And just when you think it is all over, the credits make you watch the whole thing again in 8-bit style.Congratulations, you beat the movie and wasted 106 mins of your life without smiling one time. A winner is you!",Pixels

It has some really funny parts, and if you grew up in the 80's and played some old games you will like this I am betting. Of course there are some silly parts, but that's how all Adam Sandler movies are. It reminded me a bit of Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. It was fun to watch.Ignore the reviews from critics, the SJW's these days will find anything to complain about and they did with this movie too. They want everything, whether it be a movie, video game, or comic book to cater to them.

I'm getting tired of Sandlers ultimate cool guy complex he seems to play in every move lately. Even as a nerd he comes off super cocky.

That being said, and browsing trough the reviews on this website, I've found out that most of the writers expected an intricate assay about Human existence and the very purpose of life.

To all of this viewers, this is ""the worst movie ever""; ""the type of movie that only stupid people enjoy"". In my humble opinion, this is a entertaining film that is far from being perfect.

The writers clearly didn't do a minimum effort to connect ideas around the narrative and caracteres. So, things just happen and that it is.The positive side, as a lot of people said, is that you definitely can consider it as a family movie. Children will see the colors and special effects and probably enjoy that. And you will have no concern about violence or hot scenes. For the good... and the bad.",Pixels

It wasn't your average scary alien movie. Nothing scary about this movie. It was all laughs. It was family friendly as well. It also reminded me of how sometimes we let a little setback prevent us from accomplishing our dreams. I was inspired to be better because of this movie...but mostly it was all about humor.",Pixels

335,danielnoble-79627,This movie set a High Score,10,13 August 2015,"I went to see Pixels today with my sister (aged 12) and we both thought it was fantastic. I don't understand why people are hating this movie, but it deserves far more than a 5.5 rating. This movie was MUCH better than I expected!This movie brings back the joyful memories of the 80s, featuring very famous classic arcade characters. Except this time, they're all packed into one hilarious, action-packed adventure! There was great comedy throughout this movie which made me laugh a lot. It's perfect for all the family because there is different comedy to suit different age groups, and there is only a small bit of swearing, which younger ones won't exactly recognize (there was a family in the same row as me with a child who looked about four, and he was saying after the film it was the 'Best Movie Ever'). Also, the animation of the pixelated arcade characters is very fluent and very very impressive, which is amazing when combined with the action of the movie. I can't think of anything that disappoints with this movie, however, there are some clear goofs which makes parts of the movie briefly confusing at times. That said, it doesn't really affect this fantastic movie in any way.Please ignore the critics reviews- perhaps they were terrible at the video games and hate to see them again :D? If you're not sure about the film and you think it looks terrible, trust me, it's better than it looks (like the Lego Movie) and it's the perfect treat this summer.",Pixels

A lot of kids would find this movie funny and hilarious not to mention the oldies too, but at some parts of the film I found it was a bit boring, however I do recommend this to a lot of families.

I really wanted Qbert to die, which is a sad thing to say.It could have been a hilarious movie, but the humor was cheesy and contrived. Again I get make it funny for the kids, but I think the adults who remember these games and the era would have appreciated a few more amusing jokes that they can relate to more.Saying that, it did look fantastic, great CGI, the acting was fine, and generally it was an OK watch, it just could have been so much more, its sad it didn't quite get there.",Pixels
340,romik-17725,No self-awareness whatsoever,3,11 February 2016,"I think that at some point in his career Adam Sandler lost sight of what his demographic is.

But most of us were kids / teenagers at that point and even now in retrospect while we realize that those films are a tad idiotic, there was still fun to be had. But not anymore.Pixels does not know who it's trying to reach. It has all the retro gaming references that will appeal to the 20-30 year old, but the humor and overall acting that might amuse a 10 year old at best. The casting, oh god where do I even begin. First of all, stop casting beautiful women as Adam Sandlers love interest. I mean come on - Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Salma Hayek, and now Michelle Monaghan? But the worst part - Kevin James as the president. Have you seen Paul Blart Mall Cop? Exact same character. I lost it there.I won't even get into the stupidity of the plot because that would take ages to get through. In the end I'd say that aside from the retro gaming scenes that some might find amusing and spark a hint of nostalgia, there is nothing appealing in this movie. Quite the contrary.",Pixels

343,Jeice,Bad. Unbelievably bad.,1,26 July 2015,"This was horrifying. A truly, god awful, cinematic release. Adam Sandler aside (though, yeah, he sucks in this too), the movie seems to take pride on this idea that the very demographic it's banking on seeing this movie, are a bunch of losers who live with their mothers, replaying games while covered in a cloud of Cheeto dust. Any sense of logical consistency (Which, yes, does matter even in a movie like this) is thrown out the window for arbitrary reasons. Are the aliens answering our call to war, via the video games we sent up with that probe? Or are they a confused, peaceful species? Is Q-bert a positive trophy for us? Or is he a traitor to their cause? The movie goes back and forth, and doesn't care because it's too busy trying to find some other ham fisted, bad joke about Pac man to make. Hell, the whole movie seems to just want to get you to give them money to be reminded that Centipede existed. Donkey Kong existed.

For those of you who might be averse to the presence of Adam Sandler and/or Kevin James, note that both are quite subdued in this film, especially since the real stars are the video game characters who are invading Earth. The action sequences are all brightly colored and fast paced as well as fun to watch, and since everything the aliens destroy simply pixelates and disappears, the ""violence"" is more comical than anything. Peter Dinklage also takes a surprisingly comic turn in his role as the all-time video game champion; few, if any, jokes are related to his short stature. If you're not willing to spend the money to see ""Pixels"" in the theater, do yourself a favor and at least rent it when it's released on DVD.

347,the_devil_is_hagey,A Very Entertaining film with some small issues,8,17 August 2015,"Before we walked into the Cinema, I had thought that this could either be the longest almost two hours ever, or that it would be incredibly funny.Let's face it, that sums up most Adam Sandler films... with Little Nicky, Mr Deeds and Anger Management being huge classics, and other films like Click doing a little worse... I had proof to back up that statement.I'll be the first to admit that I am quite a big geek. Having grown up in the tail end of this generation of gaming, I can remember all the games that were included in the film - admittedly I played them from the comfort of mine or my friends living room rather then the Arcades. This film had big bridges to cross....I am happy to say this film caught me off guard. Firstly, the soundtrack. A good soundtrack can make or break a film, and I thought the mix of 1970s/1980s music fitted perfectly with the feel of the film. Hearing hits from Queen and Spandau Ballet whilst watching classic games tear up the modern world seemed like a nice form of justice from the games forgotten by the modern day gamer.The storyline is a little slow and predictable in parts but the funny parts manage to over balance this. Having a linear storyline is also a safe bet, rather then risking the dangerous territory of the flashback. Starting off in 1982 and showing the two main characters developing there skills and the relationships. The directors managed to create the feel of era well, and the cameo appearance Dan Aykroyd as the championship made me chuckle, bearing in mind one of the biggest films of the 1980s was Ghostbusters.Moving onto the modern day and with the slightly interesting twist of the loser best friend being President of the United States allowed for some different comedy opportunities, including attitudes towards the Navy Seals or Secret Service. Admitedly, there are some jokes which meet all the stereotypes of cross Atlantic relations that were a little tedious, but the American self-ripping far outweighed this.The cameo appearance from Sean Bean playing an Officer in the British Army again worked well from his Sharpe days, and I will be the first to admit that I expected him to be pixel-lated faster then you can shout ""watch out Sean, it's behind you.""Overall, the plot worked well although it was a little slow in parts. Also I felt the end was a little abrupt and rushed. Taking the five or ten extra minutes to round off the story better would have certainly been money well spent.The CGI was, in my opinion, perfect. Creating a clunky version of Packman whilst also getting it to destroy New York with a realistic effect could be very difficult... too far and you'd end up with a misplaced damage sequence from Avengers or Transformers, too pixey and the film would have been stale and flat. The film managed to keep the feeling of the gaming generation well, and the CGI deserves a well earned pat on the back.The only major negative point is that some of the key scenes were in the trailer. The script was already predictable in parts but, as with most big films, too much was given away on the small screen.All in all, a good all round film that is certainly worth a watch, especially for those who like the classic, simpler world of original gaming. Now where did I leave my Atari or Sega Megadrive?Score Plot - 3 out of 5 CGI - 4.5 out of 5 Soundtrack - 4 out of 5 Overall Enjoyment - 4 out of 5",Pixels

I am sorry to tell you that your reviews, even though I like the general ratings of IMDb a lot and often they reflect my own, are total garbage in this case. And here is why: After seeing the trailer for Pixels I thought to myself ""Omg, what a stupid storyline, it does not make any sense and it looks stupid."" So I did not go to the cinema, because I didn't like the trailer. But when it actually arrived on Netflix I just couldn't help myself and watched it (I am a huge fan of Kevin Smith and Michelle Monaghan and I kinda like Adam Sandler sometimes). After I whitnessed the explanation for the entire story to be fantastic (SPOILER ALERT: NASA sent games into space and an alien race thought it was a declaration of war) I really enjoyed its comedy and special effects as well as all the characters (except Piter Dinklage's character who was just annoying af) a lot. I do not see a single flaw in the entire movie to be totally honest. Of course it is a popcorn type of blockbuster and nothing in comparison to One Flew Over the Coocoo's Nest or Pulp Fiction, but for what it was meant to be (to entertain) it was of supreme quality. Kevin Smith as a failed president was more convincing than Bill Pullman in Independence Day and the entire cast was believable, especially Monaghan did a great job playing the snobby White House employee. And oh man, the jokes were genius. I laughed my *** *** when Adam Sandler asked if no one was disgusted by his friend kissing a small green alien that suddenly changed into the woman of his dreams. And the final scene where their babies jumped around, I nearly died.So, please, for the love of god: If you are a true gamer and haven't seen the movie: WATCH IT.

356,Moveside,"Pixels: Not as bad as everybody says, but still far from great!",5,1 January 2016,"Pixel was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015, Yes even with the other also great line up of this year. I mean arcade games used to be a threat to mankind, that is awesome, Chris Columbus as director for a child friendly (more or less) action comedy, that is fitting, Adam Sandler in a movie not directed by Dennis Dugan or Frank Coraci, that can be a career change in the good way. There is one thing which can make a movie like this don't work and that's laziness and you can bet on what happened, the movie becomes lazy. Still the movie isn't as bad as anybody says it to be, its average not more and not less. Let's dive into detail Visuals: If you know Chris Columbus you know that he can't fail on this point and he didn't, there are some weak spots in the visual department but overall the movie looks good and resembles the feeling of an 80's arcade game. The Action is shot well; the scenery is nothing special but still very convincing and gives just the right feeling. It is colorful it is crazy and chaotic and in such a movie it should be. If you don't like the style, this movie wouldn't be for you anyway. Story: Here we go into the territory where it begins to fail. The Story itself is alright, but for one it is nothing original yet the same concept as other movies at the likes of Independents Day or Pacific Rim and for two it consists of so much plot holes that you can't sometimes follow it or find some parts unnecessary or confusing. But in point of story I can get an eye closed because in a movie like this the story is secondary for the entertainment. Character: That is the part the movie fails! You did have one job to do in this movie, to entertain and while the movie did entertain visionary it seriously failed to entertain in the character. For a comedy it is hardly funny and the comedy is based on very superficial humor. The jokes are neither deep nor complex often they are the same one- liners and sentences over and over again. The acting performances aren't particularly weak, but very unbelievable, which isn't a smart thing to do in a movie where the action relies mostly on the reactions in the action scenes. With a namely exception of Peter Dinklage all characters play the same archetype they always are playing or fulfilling a movie cliché like the love interests and the needy boss. There was one funny scene in the beginning of the movie I really cracked up and even that scene was superficial, not well acted and filled with one-liners. Overall: Pixels should have been one of the greats of the year but failed in doing so. Is it a bad movie nonetheless, no but it isn't good either. Visually it is solid and hit the themes it used to hit. But the story is that bland that you can't really consider it being compelling or let it suck into the world. It is surely a fun flick to watch at a party or with someone special on a Sunday evening, but don't expect a masterpiece I give it an overall score of 5/10",Pixels

361,uncle3000,Fun film with a lot of nostalgia,5,26 June 2016,"Using the basic 'alien invasion' concept this film has it all, with a nostalgic twist for the arcade games generation. A bit simple, yes, but still a fist full of entertainment.The actors do a great job, the fact that Mr.Iwatani (creator of Puck Man) participates as a hardware tech in the arcade at the beginning, is thrilling. The CGI is very well made and representation of the game characters was flawless in spite of that several famous elements from the 80's were missing.An interesting detail that sadly put me off already at the beginning of the film as we're back in the 80's browsing an arcade, - the monitors in all game cabinets are of flat screen type!? This is painfully obvious given that flat screens weren't around till at least 15 years later. All games then used standard CRT displays. In later scenes there were some CRT televisions and old CRT computer monitors shown.Personally I would have liked more of the classic games involved in the invasion. Where was Gorf, Moon Patrol, Ghosts n Goblins and several other of the time's famous characters? Donkey Kong, which by the way was a tad too generously promoted, is and always will be a great game, but as the supreme ruling force of the alien invaders, the monkey is just out of its place. Why not have the Gorf mother ship pose as the ultimate threat?Even though the film manages to deliver plenty of game nostalgia, as well as hang on to its objective as 'pixels VS humans', I can only give it a mediocre score. Because of its lack of research in the area of video game history, where it should, and could do much better. ""Pacman and Donkey Kong"" are of course two of the most famous games ever created, but how about a 'giant kung-fu master' walking down the street, kicking and beating buildings and vehicles? Or the Moon Patrol rover shooting down airplanes? And what about Scramble? I noticed the Konami logo on a few occasions, but where were the games?

Kevin James playing Kevin James as the president is completely ridiculous and unlikable( like every other role of his), however both these characters aren't the most annoying that the film has to offer. That goes to Josh Gad, he's is constantly shouting in this dreadful, high pitched voice. Monaghan is there to be another beautiful women who Sandler gets with. Peter Dinklage's character is probably the funniest character in the film, thats not too hard, and has a total of two funny things to say.I feel this film could have been a lot better as a homage to retro games but instead falls flat. If there's one simple reason not to watch this film is that Kevin James is president, enough said.",Pixels

In fact, I'm sure that part of the dialogue was either a first-take or else ad lib. How do you get Sean Bean, Adam Sandler, and a few other well-known actors to participate in something so lazy? They could have used a studio audience or a laugh track.I think I know where this movie came from. Someone decided to market a nostalgia film (1980s arcade games) to fathers who have boys aged 12-14. The humor is not sophisticated enough for a normally developed adult intellect, but it also is not appropriate for small children with all the adult themes. It doesn't work. I felt icky watching it.There are a number of 10-star reviews on here. Could the studio have hired people to write them?",Pixels

He is the best but not for any longer... One day, he lost a contest against Eddie Plant (Peter Dinklage) and the game is over. A few years later,aliens looking like the arcade games declare the war against the USA...I think that this movie is very hilarious and it is the best recipe to have a good time with your family. The movie is a pearl for the passionate about retro gaming because it brings back many memories. The story is kind of absurd and totally assumed, it is not a complex or spiritual movie just a crazy movie about aliens and games.

That being said, this movie could have been much better with a few more believable characters. Dear Kevin James, Your humor and acting style is hilarious and never gets old. Or at least that's what I would have said in 2005. But it's 2015 now, and it HAS gotten old. You're the same old goofy Kevin James in EVERY SINGLE MOVIE you do. Haven't you learned any new tricks since becoming an actor? No? Looks like you're still coasting on the same old corny dancing you got so famous for in Hitch.Seriously though, if Adam Sandler movies always pull from the same pool of about 40 actors, why not cast Blake Clark as Brenner's dad who later becomes president? The president is ashamed of his son who is a simple Nerd Brigade employee. When Galaga, Pong, and Centipede attack, the president would have no choice but to listen to his gamer son. In just two sentences I've created a more plausible plot line than casting Kevin James as president.

Pixels delivered exactly what it promised in the trailer: total misfits save the world from a wacky invasion by nostalgic aggressors. Oddly, they spent a lot of time making the premise seem logical. I hadn't planned on analyzing the plot that closely, but meh, okay. The only conceit I had trouble swallowing was someone as young as Michelle Monaghan being in her character's position. It was easier buying Kevin James in his role; seems almost believable we'd elect an doufus everyman, if only out of some kind of Clinton/Bush hangover. Next, Being a Happy Madison production, I was concerned about language, but it was nowhere near as cringe-worthy as Ant-Man, and was delivered like a bunch of twelve year-olds, which seemed to take the sting out a bit. Thank you Chris Columbus for not teaching my sixth grader any new phrases. I guess Adam Sandler filling small roles with family made a difference, and it did. I'm getting tired of ""family movies"" dropping f-bombs and angry, profanity-laden exchanges (I'm looking at you Marvel and Michael Bay).Diversity plus: no little people jokes in dialogue or set up. Diversity minus: Yet again, the world is in danger and only white Americans can save the day.

The movie has so many negative features and so little redeeming features that I find it difficult to think of any time I actually laughed while watching this poorly-produced, horribly written garbage fest. Can studios seriously produce such bad content and expect people not to retaliate? Peter Dinklage, a star actor in the Game Of Thrones universe is probably the best actor of the film, however, the 7 year old who wrote his character has done an awful job. Dinklage is a very talented actor given such a bad role. Moreover, I frankly cannot believe that Adam Sandler still gets away in acting in such terrible movies. Was he even acting in this movie? I don't know. It seems as though he was forced to act in this movie against his will. The ending. What.A.Terrible.Ending. It had me glad the movie was over so I wouldn't have to continue watching this terrible movie.The CGI was average, nothing special. However, we see so little actual CGI in the movie, the second half of the movie is just a useless time-filler with no real content or purpose.

Go for it.",7,13 August 2015,"Beware world, because your favorite video games are out to get you! Or at least in Adam Sandler's new film they are. Pixels begins with a throwback where we see teenagers Sam Brenner, Will Cooper, Ludlow Lamonsoff and Eddie 'The Fire Blaster' Plant (the adult versions are played by Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage respectively) saving the world umpteen times in video game arcades!The story then forwards to the present where Brenner works in a tech-support job while his best friend Cooper is now the President of the United States. The two are still best friends though. The twist in the tale arrives when intergalactic aliens receive feeds of classic video games and misconstrue them as an avowal of war, thus attacking Earth using classic video game characters as weapons! With the threat of war on their heads, Cooper rounds up the boys to save the world from Pacman, Centipede, Donkey Kong and more. The boys are also assisted by Lt. Col Violet Van Patten (Michelle Monaghan) in their quest to save the world and how they do it is what forms the rest of the story.Let me start by saying that Adam Sandler plays the lovable loser yet again; a role he has truly done to death. Everything from his outfits to his demeanor are exactly like they were in practically the last 20 movies he's done. So basically, you can just pick Adam Sandler out of 'Just Go With It' or 'Grown Ups', and put him in this one and you won't be able to tell the difference. It's been a while since Sandler's tried something different and it would be nice to see him in a different role for a change.This is Sandler's own production so you will see the usual suspects in supporting roles. Peter Dinklage was awesome as the cocky Eddie Plant while it was a pleasant change to see Kevin James in the role of the President! Josh Gad and Michelle Monaghan were good too. I quite liked the story and the film keeps you entertained throughout. The highlight for me though was seeing all those classic video games come to life and how! Everything from the CGI to the ""acting"" was top-notch when it came to the games.All in all, Pixels is a fun watch and you definitely won't be able to resist watching your favorite games come to life on the big screen!

This movie is a homage/cash in on arcade gamers sweet memories. When NASA send a message into space containing examples of 80's pop culture in hope of contacting alien life, the aliens that discover it mistake the message as a declaration of war. They retaliate by sending real life video game icons of old (Pac-Man, Centipede, Tetris, Pong, Galaga etc.) to destroy the world. When the military fail, the president has no choice but to call in his nerdy friends of old to use their gaming know how to defeat the alien forces.The premise of the movie is pretty unique, and actually pretty good. The plot however, leaves little to be desired. I won't spoil it here, but it is anything but impressive. The video game theme actually saves the movie, and the jokes, while dull and unoriginal for the most part, do make you laugh from time to time. The CGI, is just CGI but the visual style with the pixelated effect is very unique and makes the movie way more enjoyable to watch! The action sequences are well directed and better yet actually follow the arcade game rules! The biggest pro of the film is that it is true to its source material. When you fight the games, you fight by the rules. Video game cheat codes even play a pivotal role in the plot, which is pretty funOverall, Pixels is not an objectively good movie by any stretch of the imagination, with predictable comedy, sub-par plot and cliché characters. However, the premise saves the film from falling flat on its face. The video game sequences are what you are paying to see and when they happen, yeah, they're bloody great, and these scenes bring the funniest moments to the movie for the most part! Top it off with a few decent quips and Peter Dinklage playing the only fun character and you've got a film that isn't great, but is fun enough for arcade gamers to enjoy.

They are either A: 40 year old trying to regain their youth while trying to live through their children, or they have unbelievable talents/careers.Its one thing to try and have me believe that Adam Sandler is on some type of nerd squad, but to have a movie where Kevin James character becomes the President? With no explanation? Its a shame because the pix elated video game characters do have a nice look to them unfortunately they have to be in an Happy Madison Production.

It has made my movie-going experience more enjoyable and has made me a more appealing companion with whom to watch movies. Likewise, I adjust my rating scale based on a number of factors including genre, intended audience and self awareness.Pixels is a thoroughly enjoyable movie if you take it for what it is: a light-hearted sci- fi comedy that aims to please without being too self-conscious. At times funny, at times sweet, and always entertaining, Pixels manages to take viewers through a nostalgic ride that is well-paced and doesn't suffer from the seemingly never-ending (and often less funny) third act that is characteristic of this kind of movie.Most of the laughs come from Josh Gad and Peter Dinklage, who look very comfortable in their portrayals as quirky conspiracy theorist Ludlow and former video game master Eddie, respectively. Adam Sandler's character seems all too familiar considering the actor's recent string of movies so I won't expand on that, and Kevin James plays Cooper as you'd come to expect from Kevin James. Rounding out our cast of heroes is Michelle Monaghan as Lt. Col. Violet Van Patten, a great addition who may feel out of place in a scene or two, like when her very believable concern for the situation at hand stands in stark contrast with the farcical dialogue.The special effects in Pixels are top-notch, creating a world where you can't help but suspend your disbelief and become engrossed in the action. The references to popular arcade video games are sure to remind audience members who grew up playing them of a simpler time.In all honesty, I didn't expect much coming into this movie, so suffice it to say that I was pleasantly surprised.

Once you learn that about yourself, you should stop seeing films that are obviously meant to be stupid fun.For those who don't mind a fair bit of tom foolery, this movie is above average. It's not high art, but it has some very funny moments, and hits a lot of the same 1980s nostalgia buttons Adam Sandler movies often press. The film is comparable to Grown Ups, but for the crowd who played video games before they were cool.I liked it, my date (who is quite a bit younger and never played video games) liked it. It was a pretty inoffensive film with lots of stupid humor.

It's a break from reality, Kevin James as the president makes that argument. The visual effects are pretty impressive and the concept of video games used against us is at least something new.

Luckily my kids thought it was just as crappy as I did, so walked out about half way through with a bunch of other people at the same time. I guess some of the cgi was OK, but none of the characters worked, especially Kevin James and Adam Sandler that looked like they really couldn't be bothered.To sum up - avoid it, unless it's free and you really, really, really have done everything else in the world, but even if you have, just watch some paint dry.",Pixels

The script and dialogue appears like it was written on the back of a napkin on the day of the shoot, it's just awful and you can tell that the actors know this as the movie progresses. Make no mistake this was a paycheque to them and nothing more.just because it's a film aimed at children doesn't mean you shouldn't at least try. Positives? There aren't really any, I suppose the nostalgia effect was nice at times looking back at the games we used to play growing up, but that's about it.

And our kids laughed, too, but they didn't get most of it. (Our Singaporean audience didn't get a lot of the jokes, either.) Maybe we're just old enough to relate to these washed up gamers spending summers in front of REAL arcade games, where you had 3 lives before you had to cough up another quarter.

There was little to none character development. The first 10 minutes of the movie just flashed through the story of a kid that's good at video games. There should have been more in the movie about that kid and his friend, it was just a combination of random shots and scenes that meant nothing. Things Just Happened for absolutely no reason, like when they met the little boy that was in love with the girl from the game - ""you have no friends, do you ?"" said the good gamer's friend - ""just my grandmother"" said the lonely boy - ""well you can hang out with us"" said the gamer kid. What the hell was that? There was no point, no meaning whatsoever, it just happened, that's the end of the conversation.

It is also surprising how hard it is to accept some characters in this film considering the premise and all but I just couldn't believe Kevin James character at all. That must say something considering I'm more willing to accept the Arcade Game Invasion this movie is about over his character and his portrayal of said character. Oh well, you don't watch Adam Sandler movies for the great acting anyway.

None of the comedy was funny to either us or the child, as the obvious jokes were being cracked on screen we were all looking at each other in disbelief at how cheesy and how much of a lack of effort was put into the writing of this film!

It's sexist, boring, lazy, bafflingly inconsistent, and just plain badly written.

I had such a good time watching this, it seemed altogether too short. I wanted more.While this film may or may not appeal to those who have never enjoyed video games, it will certainly appeal to anyone who loves fantasy and enjoys movies for pure escapism. And for those who do like video games, especially anyone who, like myself, grew up playing the classic games portrayed in this movie, prepare for a rollicking great time. For people who actually played some of the original video games in arcades when they first came out, this film is a genuine treat. It is like seeing some of the characters from those old games come to life - in fact, they are larger than life.As far as jokes, dialogue and humor, Pixels delivers over and over, with lines and situations that will make you laugh out loud, and cheer and root for the underdogs and others as well. Not only is Adam Sandler back in rare form, but the rest of the cast is given great lines and executes them beautifully. I really did have one of the most fun times I've had watching a movie in years. It was a joy to just laugh and let go into the pure escapism which truly did deliver what a movie like this should deliver.If video games aren't your thing, you may still very well love this funny, silly and engaging farce. And if they are your thing, and you can appreciate characters from some of the games that started it all coming to life and creating havoc in the world, this film is absolutely not to be missed.

Everyone in their reviews have immaturely disregard the action sequences and the visual effects due to them being in an Adam Sandler movie. Plus there are cool cameos by a lot of 80's property.But the negatives are it's still an Adam Sandler movie with jokes that don't work and it doesn't know what it want to be. There are times where it's tries to have kid friend moment, but then it turns into a adult joke.I'd say your better off renting it at RedBox and skip to the action scenes.So yeah, it's a rental.It wasn't good, I wasn't mad like everyone else did.",Pixels

I rolled my eyes and sucked my teeth like ten times during the movie at some corny scenes, like when the Josh Gad character tried to kiss Brenner on the lips, or when Serena and Martha Stewart waved Eddie up at the end from the White House window. But it was an easily understandable comedy. Lots of reviews said there was no premise to the story, but there was. Lots of stories from the 80's and 90's were conjured from the idea that the capsule of human info sent from earth to space would be misinterpreted by aliens from space and they would decide to destroy earth. It has been used all the time as punchlines because back in the old days it was the biggest risk when the capsule was first sent to space.

As a relatively relaxed guy I thought this would be a fun ride, with great graphics, probably a terrible story line and a few funny (but no doubt lame) dad jokes. The movie certainly delivered on those things - but what I wasn't prepared for was the constant referencing to alcohol in the movie - think about it if you have seen this movie - drinking in the closet, he drinks (and then drives), shots of Jack at the Whitehouse, Chugging a jug and a woman skulling a bottle of beer. It seems we have moved from every movie having some ridiculous requirement to have someone smoking (think Avatar) to making it so it is really cool to drink in a closet to overcome your sadness for a marriage break up. What the hell is going on here? I also had an issue with the overt sexualisation of some of the scenes, when the singer in the band starts humping the ground was definitely one scene too far... I love funny, dirty, rude and crude films (my fav comedy is This is the End) - but to sit there and watch this with an 8 and 10 year old made things extremely uncomfortable and required a long discussion at the end of the movie about why people drink alcohol. Just for the record we have a wine cellar in the house and a full bar fridge - we just don't ""skull"" beer or drink purely to overcome sadness or emotions.",Pixels

Just watching Pixels I felt completely unimpressed and unrelaxed with the amount of lazy humour given by the cast, I remember feeling exhausted with the thought when is this perpetual film going to end. Pixels is also a disgrace to the gaming society, especially for those who are fans of arcade games because the film is unimaginative and unfond with the arcade characters, though this is the producers fault for not exploring with the characters.

I almost got up and left for this one and i actually did that for Grown Ups 2. He may still be funny, but the movies he's in sure aren't. The only reason i gave Pixels 4/10 was because of the CGI which was on par and for the idea. Other than that, the acting is decent, but the scenes are just put together like it was a 10th grade school project. It has no logic. I think that the top positive comment on this movie says it all - being written by a twelve year old... Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

At one point Adam Sandler says ""For the record, I'm an amazing kisser. All us nerds are. We appreciate it more."" and if that doesn't clue you in to how absolutely terrible this movie is then you're probably the target audience. If you need more convincing, the visibly upset woman he just met & tried to kiss (and is also providing a service for, but to hell with professionalism!) calls him ""a 210 pound dork who installs flat screens for a living."" He retorts with some ""What if I was a billionaire and we were on my yacht and I wasn't 30 going on 13"" line, basically imploring her to admit she was being shallow.

The animation fully expresses the world of '80s video games wonderfully. As a previous reviewer stated this film is destined to become a cult classic.

Look at yourselves, if you didn't enjoy yourself at this movie, you probably are taking life or yourselves too seriously. The ratings are low because people enjoy arty farty movies too much?

The plot is entirely unrealistic but the visuals are interesting and different from anything that is already out there.I really liked the costume design in this movie, the clothing and style gave the characters personality and contributed well to the overall feel of the movie. I loved how the location of film changes, from different cities. The establishing shots helped to set the mood for each scene and kept the film flowing.Even if you are not a fan of this genre of movie and haven't particularly enjoyed Adam Sandler's work in the past then you should watch purely for the soundtrack alone, with music from Queen, even if you hate the film it makes the whole 106 minutes worth it.",Pixels
437,marksherlock,Pixels Movie,10,21 July 2015,"Was at the premiere Saturday 7/18. I am an Sanders, James, Dinklage, Gadd and Monaghan fan. Being a child of the 80's didn't hurt either. Historically accurate spin on the entertainment of gaming in the 80's, which then translates into the invasion of earth. I thought the writing was done for Sandler, James and Gadd. The comedy element was purely for them. Monaghan can adapt to any role and is truly an under appreciated talent, she rocks it here. If you love 80's music, you will love the music in this movie! Nice to see Dinklage in something other than Game of Thrones. He is a gifted actor. This will be the Family Movie of the summer! You will laugh and rock-n-roll in your seat!",Pixels
438,emilymarie-45107,Very enjoyable,7,24 July 2015,"A fantasy flick that didn't need to be 100% serious to be appreciated. Don't let the negative reviews here fool you, this is a kickazz flick. I'm unsure why some people don't like the movie, it was full of laughs, a plausible storyline with great characters and action packed scenes.. What's not to like when all you want to do is relax and be entertained?! This is a very cute n funny movie. Is it a masterpiece? Of course not.. But it's a lighthearted comedy sure to please. Don't over think this movie folks... If you want drama and thought provoking, rent Gone Girl. If you want funny, entertaining and awesome for the family, see this movie.",Pixels
439,atnika,Not bad at all,10,25 July 2015,"Being an old school gamer of the 80s myself, I did enjoy the movie and there were a few funny moments. My wife even cried a bit a couple of times, and my 5+ y.o. son was frightened a couple of times, too :) For modern kids some of the scenes would require a bit of explanation, but my son is familiar with the most big titles of the 80s, so the movie was entertaining for him as well. I'm not too demanding on the plot part, I'm happy that such ""bitxploitation"" movies are filmed at all. The beginning was especially promising and made me a bit sentimental. Overall, pretty good work. Not sure why it has got so many negative reviews.",Pixels
440,lrp-18043,Awesome!!,10,25 July 2015,Personally I loved this movie! It is def meant for people who grew up playing the games from the 80's. I'm a 90's baby but I grew up playing those games and this movie took me back. It's def a comedy and you have to watch it with an open mind. It was funny and really cute and brought back lots of memories. I would highly recommend going to see if for the nostalgia of the good ol days and for a good laugh. Oh and the graphics!! They were so good!! You got the retro 80's feel with the games but so much better quality! A++++ for the graphics! I liked the group of actors they used for this movie. They also grew up in the time period that these games were from so I know they enjoyed making it. It's just a really fun movie!,Pixels
441,tdr-91443,Yes its ridiculous but funny and entertaining.,8,25 July 2015,"I want to start off by saying that, I have never reviewed a movie before. I felt compelled to do so due to the bad rep this movie appears to be receiving. The bottom line is it was comical and entertaining. The idea though ridiculous, was at least fresh to all the movies being produced today appearing to be recycled from other movies. It kind of reminds me of the original Hot Tub Machine movie that was unexpectedly a fresh idea and was entertaining. Like that movie , there were parts of this movie that were just plain funny and amusing. The movie theater I was in most people laughed multiple times, I can not remember another movie (recently) where the majority of the moviegoers were noticeably laughing. I enjoyed the movie for a new idea and found it to be entertaining. Isn't that what a movie is suppose to be?",Pixels
442,his_j_man,Awesomely fun movie,1,25 July 2015,"The premise of this movie is sure to please anyone who was alive in the 80s with a love of games, nostalgia, and even 80s cameo appearances. It's a fairly clean movie too with some nice surprises. I haven't laughed so hard in a long time as when Ludlow tries to give a pep talk to soldiers. A refreshing point is also that we aren't treated with the typical feminazi nonsense you would expect to see in an exchange between male and female lead characters. To see a male fire some stinging one-liners right back at a woman, sniping both the class divide and hypergamy as well, is not the trend Hollywood usually pushes. It was a nice change. There is also a tiny jab at Obama near the end of the movie, you have to listen to catch it, as some of the political jokes will fly over peoples heads. The nerd jokes will also fly over peoples heads who are not familiar with the culture. It is definitely a good time movie, ignore the politically correct out-of-touch haters. If you are easily offended at Sandler-esque insults, slight crude humor, or if you are expecting a 'serious' movie, this is not for you.",Pixels

The actors work quite well at their parts and the characters are quite believable. The CGI is good, and so are the other special effects.It starts out funny and continues all the way to the end, and the credits are quite interesting, matching the theme of the movie quite well. If you watch the movie, stick around for the credits.If you love 80s Video Games, give Pixels a try, it isn't a bad movie in any way.The cameos fit into the movie quite well.There is not very much Advertising for products in the movie, which is good. The only Products that appear are Yoo-Hoo chocolate drink and Bud Light beer, really.",Pixels

The majority of the negative reviews (from what I read) don't appreciate or like any of his movies. Why go if you are just gonna hate it? He still adds his classic jokes so I would recommend this movie if he makes you laugh.I grew up on those arcade games as a child and I loved how he portrayed it.

If you lived through the 80s, u will get a kick of nostalgia. If u are a kid, u get a lot of laughs, kids like some raunchy, it sure beats profanity and over sexualized movies.

I thought this movie would be fun, but then I saw it was an Adam Sandler movie and assumed it would be lazy, boring, unfunny and stupid. Unable to resist seeing giant Pac-Man and Centipedes, I purchased the official DVD anyway (or maybe I just downloaded it; you decide.) I kept my thumb on the fast-forward until a video game sequence. When the video game sequences ended, and it switched back to ""plot"" and ""comedy"", I fast forwarded again to the next video game sequence. In this way, I was able to enjoy the entire 5 minute movie.Two stars for five minutes of fun. -1 star for being a Sandler movie.Bottom line: Best enjoyed in fast forward.",Pixels
447,comedykingtt,6/10 For Making Me Smile,6,30 July 2015,"This film was fun, funny, and just plain cool. Its strong suits relied on humor, and fun video game references, two things of which I am a personal fan of. Was this the best work for Chris Columbas or Adam Sandler? No, and this is coming from a die-hard fan of both. But the characters were fun and the cast did a great job of performing them. All that being said, it did have some issues that keep it from being a ""quality flick"" in my opinion. It seemed as though the stories cheated around all the characters were good, but not well managed. It seemed as though they rushed through all the personal plot lines. So while this movie really hit a good vibe for a fun-loving movie-goer like myself, it seemed as though they didn't make enough time for characters development to be well displayed. All in all, everything wrong with this movie could've been fixed with pacing. None of this is the fault of the hilarious cast or great director. POTENTIAL SPOILERS:The highlights: 2Josh Gads character plays a conspiracy theorist who is extremely socially awkward and does a great job. Josh Gad had an excellent performance and watching his chemistry with Sandler was really a treat. Josh Gad was funny. The Pac-Man scene in NYC is a good thrill that can also cause you to laugh out loud. This scene was best described as ""AWESOME"" because it was a well put together fun scene that everyone who loves movies can appreciate. Thanks for reading.",Pixels
448,mitnor,I don't usually like Adam Sandler but loved this movie!,8,1 August 2015,"I went to see this movie because it was a good show time, amidst a toss up of 4 movies, and in spite of the reviews. What a surprise! I laughed throughout.Yes, the writing could have been better, most of the characters were not believable (with the notable exception of the Wonder Kid who was very believable!), and some of the acting did appear somewhat stiff. I didn't think it detracted too much from the movie, as this is a silly movie. I think why I didn't mind the minor faults was that the movie was quick to point out some of them and make fun of itself. This is not a movie to take seriously, just like almost all of Sandler's previous ones. It is fun, the special effects are great, and it was entertaining.",Pixels

This movie makes fun for everything related to 80's and how we can miss that age and the idea to mix those feelings were really great. I grew up using Arcade Machines (I'm from 90's generation) but I played those video games. I laughed a lot, and the other people at the cinema did it as well. I gave it 9 because I had a good night laughing, and the last part (Spoiler): with Peter Dinklage looked at Serena and Martha Stewart was hilarious, that Look of degenerated he did was awesome.",Pixels

If your a little younger you'll still probably enjoy it.The movie is not without it's flaws but if you don't analyze it too much and just sit down with your bucket of popcorn and disengage the logical side of your brain for an hour and a half you'll be glad you did.It has romantic elements, plenty of silly moments, comedy that doesn't fall flat too often, a crazy plot which you just have to roll with and special effects that have a certain retro style that gels well with the movie. It reminded me of Ghostbusters which is not a bad thing.Ignore the low ratings and go see it so they make enough money to green light a sequel. Plleeeeaasse :)",Pixels

Paul Blart, The Mall Cop is President of the United States, and Happy Gilmore, the voice of Olaf the Snowman and the children's author that Will Ferrell calls ""Elf"" are going to attempt to save the world from alien invaders using 1980's video games. I was surprised that my ten and seven year old girls liked it too. However, they had many questions about the references to the '80's pop stars and icons and many of the arcade games meant nothing to them.

I love the concept for this film with it being inspired by old arcade games but I don't think they pulled it off very well. It was kind of like 'oh no they are being attacked by space invaders who are going to destroy the world but its OK because in the final battle something will happen which makes them more determined to save the world and then they kill the big boss and then everything is fine' Its just so predictable. I was really interested in this film because I love video games and as soon as I hear the title and saw the cover I immediately wanted to see it but now i'm just a bit disappointed. It could have been such a good film but instead turned out to be a disaster. I decided to give a 5/10 because, for me, the concept of the film was amazing but they just didn't pull it off right.",Pixels

The plot itself is genius, whoever wrote it has certainly blown my mind. If you are put off by the fact it contains mild language, don't be, it is rarely used thought out the movie and is scarcely noticeable, there was a young boy who looked about 6 in our row and he was cheering that it was ""the best movie ever!"" I am twelve and I was not put of by the rude language despite the film being a 12A. It has a great balance of action, romance, jokes and suspense. I thought the animation and graphics were incredible, they really brought the video game characters to life however in some scenes I found it difficult to tell what the attackers were (but that is probably because I am 12) that said I knew what the three main Video games featured were so it didn't ruin the experience at all, only left me curious after the movie. All that said I can actually sum up this move in one sentence, incredibly clever movie filled with action and suspense, couldn't wait to watch it and I wasn't at all disappointed.",Pixels
454,attorneychriscarr,Great Movie ! Can't Believe all the Abysmal Reviews,10,13 August 2015,"I think some people are expecting WAY too much out of this movie. It's a kids movie which has a lot of appeal for adults. It's one of the more appealing kids movies I've seen in years. It's definitely geared more towards the 8-12 crowd, rather than younger kids' movies (like Despicable Me, which is also great). The language is a bit course at points, but nothing too bad.I read all these horrible reviews and was not looking forward to it, but it was SO entertaining! I was worried that it would be another crappy Adam Sandler movie (I like him, but he has definitely had some real bombs). But he did NOT try to hijack the entire movie like some people suggest. He shared the screen well with the other actors.Sure, Kevin James was a strange choice as president but, again, IT'S A KIDS MOVIE! While some adults can't handle the package delivery guy from King of Queens being president, most of the target audience probably doesn't even know who he is. And he is NOT playing some bumbling doofus like in Mall Cop. He successfully pulls off the role of a president who is stuck in a video game and I cannot imagine anyone else doing a better job.All in all, the movie was very entertaining (better the the Minions movie I took the kids too last month--snore...). How do you NOT enjoy seeing Pacman gobbling up cars and people like dots on the streets of New York City. Each game was parodied just the right amount. I wouldn't have wanted 90 minutes of any one video game, but I think they are successful in giving you just enough of each video game ""battle"" to keep in interesting and not boring. It's exciting enough for kids that aren't familiar with the old- school games, but gives some nostalgia (and some subtle grown-up humor) to keep the adults entertained.Sure, no one is going to win an Academy Award for this film, but it is funny, entertaining and an enjoyable way to spend an hour and 45 minutes.",Pixels

Some people may comment that the acting was lack luster and stale even cheesy, however I believe that was the intent. You'll notice at the starting credits that Sandler's production company ""Happy Maddison"" was used so you can imagine the type of humour. The story was funny uncomplicated but riddled with little innuendos and subtle jokes that will keep Adults laughing.The Idea that a Computer nerd could have a beer and pretzels friendship with the president of the USA cracked me up and I think a lot of people will enjoy the slapstick tongue in cheek humor used In this film.If you like Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison, here comes the boom.

It's a movie about a video game apocalypse starring Adam Sandler. What in the world were they expecting? Citizen Kane? The Godfather? The problem with these so-called film critics today is that they're impervious to accepting anything at face value. I believe it got such awful review from critics because it starred a lot of big name actors and maybe they expected more substance from them; but you have to look at the source material before making those determinations. This is a tongue-in-cheek slapstick comedy that's meant to entertain people especially those who grew up in the 80's and can relate to the video game evolution nostalgia of that time.

The idea that aliens would consider our ""Space Time Capsule"" a challenge of war was hysterical. Bringing back the gamer world champions from that era was even funnier. Peter Dinklage was brilliant, in a creepy convict kind of way!As a children/teens gamer of the 70s and 80s, my husband and I loved this homage to our old stomping grounds, the arcade.

It's a little above average, the special effects are good and the humour, on the whole, is quite good too, but as an aficionado of older games it doesn't do that aspect justice; there are a lot of incorrect references and it doesn't show the fantasy of that particular gaming age in it's full glory.

469,masonirving,"Pixels: Good, but Flawed - Mason Irving",6,27 December 2015,"This is a good film, but it has its flaws.I saw this a few weeks after the film came out, and I was definitely hesitant, especially after I found the movie starred Adam Sandler. But, with direction by Chris Columbus, famous for the first two Harry Potter films and the first two Home Alone films, and not directed by Dennis Dugan, I was excited. And I really liked it! I should have expected the panning, but due to the previously mentioned factors, I was kind of shocked. I thought this film was good! Some of the jokes are spot on, like Q*Bert cussing, the creator of Pac-Man calling his creation a bitch (not knowing what that means, anyway), the scene where Josh Gad's character Ludlow is screaming at the soldiers that they are about to train, and Sam moon-walking into the Oval Office are some of the funniest moments in the movie. The visuals were awesome, and the plot was very well thought out. I really thought it hit the mark.Is it the greatest movie in the history of the world? No, that would be over praising it, definitely. This movie is funny, but not up there with the greats in comedy films like Monty Python (HECK NO). This movies without a doubt has it flaws. The character of Violet van Patten, played by Michelle Monaghan, is a boring and undeveloped character. I know she wasn't the main character in focus, but she is a MAIN character, and she NEEDS development. The romance is horrible. The scene in the beginning where Sandler's character goes in the closet and talks to Violet made me feel UNCLEAN. It felt like something a stalker would do. The two characters also have no development as a couple, taking the easy way out in that the girl is impressed by the heroic boy that she just met, and decides to get together with him. Some of the other relationships are bad, too. Q*Bert turns into Lady Lisa out of freaking nowhere, and she, a hot fictional character, marries this nerd who is in love with a hot FICTIONAL CHARACTER. Even if this sucked, the baby Q*Bert scene was hilarious. Some of the jokes were miss. The subtlety of the fact Sandler's character is a nerd is not subtle at all, unfortunately.I also hated the use of the cliché that all kids these days play modern FPSs like COD or Halo. It's not technically a cliché, because it is kind of true, but it made me cringe seeing it in a movie with 80s video game characters.Speaking of which, if you grew up in the 80s and 90s, you will CRY with nostalgia while seeing this movie. Everyone's here; Defender, Space Invader, Donkey Kong, Pac-Man, EVERYONE! And that is freaking COOL!Should you see this? Give it a try, you either love it or hate it. I think you should check it out. I can see why people dislike this film, and I respect that. But I just wanted to show you this movie in a whole new light. It's flawed, not the best, but I think you should try it!",Pixels
470,Compact729,Could Have Been a Good Family Film,7,23 February 2016,"Overall, the movie was pretty good. The special effects were pretty cool, and it was neat to see so many classic arcade games that I remember from my youth. However, it was difficult to really enjoy this movie because of the excessive sexual references and bad language that really don't even contribute anything to the movie, in my opinion. My daughter wanted to see this, but I don't really want her to watch it because of the content. This is one thing I dislike about many Adam Sandler movies. I like a lot of them, but they just go too far with the sexual references and foul language, and since I have a family, I prefer to watch movies that we all can enjoy. This could have been one of them...",Pixels

This was one of those films I would watch it again and still enjoy the story, a perfect 10 for reminding those of us who were brought up in the arcade era. Adam was awesome and was the perfect man for this role despite what some critics say. The author did a good job on the story lines and the music was wonderful. Kids from the 80s all remembered the arcades. Filled with games who's images were a blend of pixelated images which brought many fun hours to everyone's lives. These arcades were considered the coolest places to hang out, sadly these days with the ever fast pace moving technology video game arcades are fading out fast... this story reminds us of those fun days. Many harsh critics jumped to criticize this movie however they would soon understand they picked the wrong movie to pick on. All those gamers brought up in the arcade age will love this movie and back the film and Adam Sandler for years to come!",Pixels

I grew up in the 80's, so all these games and concepts were familiar to me.But my favorite scene, by far, was when Ludlow gives his pep talk to the Navy SEALs. I literally had to stop the movie playing on my seatback monitor, because I was laughing so hard I was crying. Twice. It was incredible.I mean, this is not an intellectual exercise -- it's an Adam Sandler comedy. But for what it is, it's a gem.This could also be a kids movie.

PAC man only have one opportunity left. And the driver hit PAC man .2nd reason characters my favorite character is Donkey Kong . because he throw barrels and could kill people but brad killed Pac man and Donkey Kong . And he save the world. My favorite part was cuber was when cuber was jumping in the trampoline and he fell. And a cone is PAC man and Donkey Kong takes allot of time to go to the world.

476,rsrabie-84291,What a fun comedy movie!,10,13 March 2016,"It's been so long since a movie has been so much fun and held my interest with quirky moments at the same time! Adam Sandler is his usual fun loving self in the movie and they have these big dreams when they're still kids, but we all know how you can dream big but don't reach the level you expected due to life that happens. Anyway, they are now adults and find out that their old habit and skills for playing video games comes in handy against an alien threat in the form of video game bosses that wants to fight humanity according to a time capsule containing video of them playing these games and defeating the end bosses, that NASA sent up during their childhood. Aliens have obviously misinterpreted the message and thinks they should do battle against Earth in the form of video game end bosses.Peter Dinklage really surprises with his very fun portrayal of one of the kids now grown up. He shows how diverse an actor he truly is and ends up being one of the most lovable characters in the movie. Don't listen to the bad reviews of this movie, as it might really surprise you just like it did me. I only really watched it because of Peter Dinklage whom I am a big fan of. Thank you for reading this review!",Pixels
477,stmc-25959,"My review of one of the worst movies in a while, Pixels",2,3 September 2018,"A lot of people said how bad Pixels is. That is one of the worst movies made. But I had hope that maybe this movie was good. That one person may like this where others hate it. Hope that this isn't as bad as it. You know what I did that hope after watching this movie. I took it behind my house and shot it in the back of the head. Then set it on fire. This movie was awfulThe opening scene is Brenner and Will as kids and what do they do? They steal a little girl's money selling lemonade. Our heroes ladies and gentlemen. Clearly this two have high moralsYears after a time capsule is shot into space with video game footage, aliens find the capsule and immediately think it's an act of war. The aliens are stupid. This aliens are so advance that they are basically pure energy and yet they can't see video games are just for entertainment. Do they have any entertainment or are this aliens not only stupid but boring as well?My biggest complaint is Peter Dinklage character Eddie. He's just awful. The character is basic guy who thinks he's the best in the world and just a terrible human being. He's in prison and one of his demands of his help is he wants Serena Williams and Martha Stewart in the Lincoln bedroom. I have never felt more unclean until he said that. I almost got sick. Literally my stomach felt terrible. In the ""last"" battle against Pac-Man, he cheated. He put into a code to make his car move faster. Wait what!?! That makes sense in a video game but IS REAL LIFE!!! You cannot enter a cheat code and suddenly boom you're unstoppable. And he never really learned his lesson really. He just says I'm sorry and everything is good. No. No! NO! He's the biggest reason the aliens called them cheaters because he cheated. He in the end he gets Serena and Martha in the Lincoln bedroom. He shouldn't of be rewarded at allOne of the things that bug me the most is Admiral Porter ""The Bully"" doesn't his comeuppance. He spent most of movie shooting down Sandler and Josh Gad's characters but never gets is just desserts. He has that doesn't make sense to me at all. He's watching TV about Sandler and all the good his teams done and say ""I don't know what's worst. If they fail or they succeed"". That answer is easy. IF THEY FAIL!!! They fail and world is destroyed. Are you the egotistical? Later he calls out Sandler and Michelle Monaghan characters and that's the last we see of him. It would of been awesome if he was fired or something. ANYTHING!!!OK. I have said a lot of bad things. Let's talk about some good things and put some bad things about them. First everyone had a problem with Kevin James as The President of the United States. He was a great president. He acted like a president. People only see him a party animal or blue collared slacker. Here he doesn't. Yes there is a scene where he party with the troops after a victory over the aliens but I would of react the same way. When Sandler and Gad brings proof of the aliens, he doesn't believe them like the president would. He acts like a president would and should. The only problem I have is Jane Krakowski plays his wife. I'm sorry but I don't see Kevin James and Jane Krakowski hooking up. It's just weirdI really enjoyed how the aliens communicated. They used old video clips to communicate their massages. I had Ronald Reagan. Hall & Oates. They even had Madonna. That was pretty funnyI don't have a problem with Josh Gad's character being in love with a video game character. A lot people are. I mean come on Rule 34. Enough saidFinally Adam Sandler plays a character that isn't a idiot. I know he has before but we have gotten so use to it that we just accept it. His character, Brenner, which is a terrible name for a person, see patterns in video games that no one could find. That's amazing. He could tell the difference between the 1982 and 1986 video game. That to me is pretty cool. I wouldn't be able to the difference and I doubt others could too. My main problem he let's that lost in a video game tournament when he was a kid control his life. I'm not going to pretend this hasn't happened to anyone. I've had some events were I wish I could go back and changed it but here's the thing, it was one event. JUST ONE and he got second place in a national tournament. My God if I got second place in anything national, I'd been the happier guy around. You couldn't surgically removed the smile. It would look like The Joker from Tim Burton's Batman. Yeah that big. And yet he not thinks that was terrible but let it control his life. I'm sorry. I know you are trying to make me feel bad for this character but it doesn't come off like that. It feels like a bird poop on your car so can't drive that car anymore it was some it ws traumatic. It's nothingIn conclusion, it's not a bad idea. It just doesn't work here. Someone may like this, I'm just not that someone",Pixels
478,jimkabosh,"CGI was pretty sweet, movie script was extreme cringe.",4,14 December 2016,"I just had to make a review to point this out: If you can't see the ""pattern"" within the predictable and basic-programmed AI in The Last Of Us, it's because you're not a gamer.Just because the games today are more dynamic, complex, and open, doesn't mean they don't have a pattern, otherwise what's the game?! a game is learning the patterns, as complex as they may be, losing over and over and over again, and learning how to PLAY....... the game... Gamers who like legit game a lot, are the kind of people to seek patterns even in their real life, many gamers will claim that ""real life is actually a game"", some people think they crazy saying that, but if you game enough, you develop your brain to see the patterns, and yeah real life is probably an extremely complex and dynamic filled with puny details game and the patters are insanely vast and different at each corner, but they still exist.To add a bit about the movie, horrible, even creepy, approach from Adam's character onto the mother of the kid, setting a horrible example for children (since people say it's a movie mostly kids should watch) about how to speak, look, or behave with women. yes, the teasing (afterwards) was kinda nice and silly, but it wasn't in any capacity the right way to do it, nor the appropriate response from the girl. Movie itself wasn't serious at all, when I say at all I mean AT ALL, it was from start to finish ""I win cause I'm the protagonist"" kind of thing, and again, sets a horrible example for children, having people who don't train, do not work hard for what they can do, just do things and succeed, because... this set of mind is what makes kids egotistical, makes them think that they will win because they are they, they are the most important, so they should be listened to and get everything... and when they lose they become very salty losers, instead of embracing the lost as part of their experience and being eager for next time, like GAMERS (aka the thing they act like they know what they are talking about) learn to do. Being respectful? working hard? making your dreams with your own hands? pffffft please... just get into a car and drive like a pro drifter! WHATEVER.. grab a gun too on your way, start shooting things cause no one ever needed training in shooting a gun pfffffffffffffffft. these guys don't even game, and even though gamers are more likely to pick up how to use a gun faster than non-gamers, I would NOT expect gamers to be good with a gun right again, let along some guy who's best skill is speaking like he knows anything. Just forget about it, look it's not a bad filler thing to watch whenever you need pass some time or whatever, the CGI and the filming look pretty good and the reason this gets 4 and not 1 (or 0 if I could), so look at those and enjoy the detail while they pass by and you may enjoy it! that is if you can handle some really heavy cringe moments along the way. Kid was the best character (and good actor, pretty impressive for the age) in the movie, smart, intelligent speaking, respectful, understanding, supportive, and actually cool dude. The only relationship that made sense is the virtual warrior and the nerd, since she's an alien and probably never herd the word ""love"" before, was still creepy at the end, first time I agreed with Adam's character in this movie.p.s This is not a movie about gamers, these guys know pretty much nothing about gaming, like completely nothing... like Donald and Hillary talking about ""the cyber"" kind of nothing. so don't go in expecting any of that.Have a good one! ❤️",Pixels

481,doctorpoke,A movie which only has visuals going for it,1,20 January 2017,"Pixels was a movie I was optimistic about seeing. Then I saw it. The first of a few problems is the actors. Adam sandler is a good actor in this, but his character is bad, the female and the nerd dude are forgettable, Kevin James and Peter dinklage are awful (Acting and characters), and the rest of the cast is irrelevant. The plot loses cohesion as the movie progresses, and it is not explained how dinklage cheated on both the arcades and in the pac-man battle, and the aliens somehow know eddie cheated. The last and most glaring problem is major anachronisms throughout the film. As well as Madonna, Samantha Fox, Daryll Hills, John Oates, and Max Headroom all being relevant AFTER 1982, when the capsule was stated to have been launched, many games are also improperly shown. Arkanoid (Taj Mahal, it's not Breakout, as that was only on the Atari 2600 and 5200), The duck hunt dog, Paperboy, and tetris were all after 1982 (Duck hunt was released first in the 1970's, but the dog did not appear until 1984 on the NES). The only positive is the pixel effect. Though technically voxels, it still looks very nice. To quote Rotten Tomatoes ""Pixels has little replay value and is hardly worth a quarter.""",Pixels
482,Maestro_S,"It has potential and great characters, but it's still lacking.",6,11 October 2018,"At first glance, this is just another Sandler movie with 'Paul Blart'. That's not where the movie's potential lies. The result is still a mediocre kid-in-an-adult-body representation of Sandler's expression. The addition of historical video game characters gives it a bit of a nostalgic experience that could (and should) have been investigated further. By adding Peter Dinklage and his pivotal character to the cast, ""Pixels"" was boosted to an acceptable level which makes it enjoyable for small children, or the nerds who enjoy the backgrounds of the various details. Unfortunately, these backgrounds would have made the movie a good watch if they were given a more prominent position in the foreground, to hide the lacklustre interaction between the main characters. The idea and resources were all there, but in the end the sum of the parts didn't add up to a whole movie.CGI was fine, entertaining, but ""lame"". ""Pixels"" felt like Elijah Wood's reaction to the arcade game Marty McFly discovers in ""Back to the Future II"". Luckily we don't need our hands to watch ""Pixels"".In the end, it's worth a watch, but for those who don't understand the backgrounds and details, it'll be nothing more than an inflight entertainment second choice.",Pixels
483,fassenza,Awful - No other words,4,17 January 2016,"I very rarely take the time to review movies, but I had to put in my two cents' worth on this one. I should start by saying that I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. I don't dislike him, I generally just don't like his movies. A few exceptions would be 50 First Dates, which I liked, and Click and The Wedding Singer, which weren't bad.But this movie . . . Wow! Did anyone read the script before they green-lighted it? I cannot imagine anything worse, even if they had intended to make a bad movie.More of the same garbage from Adam Sandler. This abomination has the same thing nearly all his other movies have had: humor that only eight, nine and maybe ten-year-old boys would (should) think was hilarious. So it's come to this: I honestly believe that if not for the normal bodily functions of humans (and animals of course) for Sandler to make fun of -- over and over and over again in this, and about all of his movies, he'd be a broke joke remembered mostly for his okay SNL skits from 25 years ago. From horrible dialogue to incredibly offensive stereotypes (and this is coming from someone who loathes being pc) this movie has just about everything you can think of to dislike in a movie.A truly awful movie that I couldn't get but about half-way through it was so bad.",Pixels
484,maxx_the_great,Gave my Girlfriend a Panic Attack,2,12 July 2017,"I was not blown away by it. The idea was cute, but Adam Sandler's character was unnecessarily vulgar as usual, talking to a female character that was an unrealistic bimbo and everything was pretty predictable, so it wasn't my cup of tea... but there is something worse...There is no way around this: this movie induced a full-on panic attack in my girlfriend. We were just watching it to pass the time, but at first she was bored, then she was trying really hard to not watch it, playing games on her phone, etc, then I had to turn the movie off, shortly after the PacMan scene, because she asked me to. I later asked her about it, and she told me it was triggering her anxiety.You see, my girlfriend has irregular anxiety about existential dread: We don't really know what happens in the afterlife, and she is incredibly worried that it would be just boredom and nothingness, or maybe there is something happening there, but it is so uninteresting that it makes you wish that even it was not happening, as you are trapped there in bored purgatory for all of eternity.This movie gave my girlfriend a panic attack, because it reminded her of her greatest fear that she could be trapped in boredom for all of eternity.2/10 the animation was cute",Pixels

486,Bob2468723,Pixels: Must Watch,9,17 October 2017,"The movie, Pixels directed by Chris Columbus, is a great family movie because it has great humor and incorporates life lessons for children. Pixels is about these teenagers, Sam Brenner, Will Cooper, Ludlow Lamonsoff ""The Wonder Kid,"" and Eddie ""The Fire Blaster"" Plant who all loved playing classic arcade games. In 1982, there was a video game championship which was videotaped in order to be included in the time capsule that NASA would send out in hopes to get in touch with extraterrestrials. Eddie becomes the ultimate champion which leads Sam to believe that he can never be great at anything for the rest of his life. The Voluva, the belligerent extraterrestrials, receive the time capsule and take it as a threat and invade Earth. Now Sam Brenner, Will Cooper, Ludlow Lamonsoff, and Eddie Plant must work together to defend Earth from there invaders. Critics say that Pixels is a poorly made movie, and the actors are just trying to make money, but I say that Pixels is a great movie because it teaches you life lessons, shows people that life does get better, and has credible actors and actresses. Pixels teaches not only kids, but adults that using the shortcuts in life may not always be the best option. Eddie uses cheat codes as a kid to become the video game world champion. Matty learns that Eddie uses cheat codes when the police fish his sunglasses out of the river from the fight against Pac-Man. He finds that Eddie has written cheat codes on the top of his shades which he used to cheat against Sam and even in the challenges that the aliens sent. The aliens send Earth a message saying that they have violated the rules of the game and that ultimately makes them the winner if the challenges and they can now destroy Earth. Everyone in the United States government blames Sam for losing, even though Eddie is the real reason why Earth has lost. This proves that cheating always has consequences even if it is not in the foreseeable future. Pixels teaches the audience that cheating is not the answer, and it also teaches them that people should never give up. The audience learns that no matter how far one has fallen, even if they have hit rock bottom, one can always come back. As a teenager, Sam loses to Eddie in the video game championships in 1982, and he loses confidence in himself. Sam never really finds his purpose in life because he thinks that he is not capable of doing anything. This all changes when the aliens invade Earth and he steps up top save the whole world. He learns that Eddie cheated when he played in the video game championship and he realizes that makes him the real video game champion. This gives him a huge confidence boost and he uses that to defeat the ""boss"" and saves Earth. Pixels demonstrates how people can come back from anything if they try hard enough. Moreover, Pixels shows that everyone can have a happy ending. The audience learns that even though one can be really weird and awkward, they can still have a happy ending. Ludlow is a really weird character who never really had any friends. He loves conspiracy theories and he fantasies about being with this character, Lady Lisa, who is a part of a video game. When the extraterrestrials invade Earth, he has to fight Lady Lisa to defend Earth. Ludlow realizes that he does not have the heart to kill her, so he confesses his love for her and she joins his side. They end up getting married and having ""kids."" Even though people may seem that they will not live a great life, if you work hard anything is possible. Pixels also cast credible actors and actresses. Well known actors and actresses, that are famous for comedy, star in Pixels. The leading actors and actresses are Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Michelle Monaghan, and Josh Gad. Adam Sandler is a well known actor who has a reputation of being very funny, and Josh Gad is known for his work playing Olaf in Frozen. Many people expected the movie to be a lot better than it actually was because of the actors that starred in it. Although some people think Pixels is a waste of time, I think it is great movie to watch with your friends and family. The movie, Pixels, teaches children life lessons such as, working hard to get what you want, never giving up, and how cheating is never the answer. Some people argue that Pixels is a really bad movie and it is not worth watching at all, but I say that Pixels is one of the best movies I have ever seen that has incorporated video games in a unique way to teach life lessons.",Pixels

Once you get that straight then the movie makes comedic sense.This was a much funner movie than I thought it would be. I like Adam Sandler (loved Happy Gilmore) but a couple of his recent movies have been admittedly bad ""Jack & Jill).The nostalgia it brought back along with the jokes and puns (most of which were intentionally nerd lame) were part of what made the movie more enjoyable. A lot of the jokes were NOT aimed at the children's age group.The movie was definitely written to appeal to those of us that played these games back in the 80's and definitely NOT written for people who only like Xbox/playstation/PC gaming.I left the movie laughing and joking and was generally surprised I liked it a lot more than the trailers made me think I would.After reading some of the online reviews it seems a lot of Adam Sandler trolls are busy bashing it.I liked it better than the new Mad Max, the new Terminator, and a few other big time movies I've seen lately so I say ignore the haters and go watch the movie if you have any fond memories of playing Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Centipede, Defender, Galaga, Frogger, Qbert, and tons more..... the trip back on memory lane is worth the price of admission.",Pixels
