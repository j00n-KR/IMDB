0,bkoganbing,Grandpa and grandson both get girls,5,1 February 2019,"It's both joyous and sad for the Kelly family. Family patriarch Robert DeNiro is mourning the death of his wife, but at the same time grandson Zac Efron a newly
minted attorney is about to get married to Jewish princess Julianne Hough. But
grandpa still has gas left in the tank and apparently none of the ailments that
most seniors have that are in their early 70s. He wants to cut loose and he thinks
his grandson ought to as well and maybe reassess his marital plans.Well they both wind up getting girls. I suppose there are 20 somethings who
have a thing for raunch geriatrics and DeNiro finds Aubrey Plaza. And Efron
finds an old college contemporary who knew him when he was into art and
photography with Zoey Deutch.The two get into quite a number of scrapes and DeNiro has some moves that
Efron couldn't conceive that grandpa had. DeNiro was mostly a career army
man and did some classified service at the time for Uncle Sam.I might have enjoyed this more, but I really have to resent having a drug dealer
and a serious one at that as a comic character. Nothing funny about the product Jason Mantzoukas sells and it ain't just some good weed. Wrong message going out there.Still the romping DeNiro and Efron do is fun to watch.",Dirty Grandpa
1,SnoopyStyle,unappealing,4,19 June 2016,"Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) is a straight-laced corporate lawyer engaged to Meredith Goldstein (Julianne Hough). He attends his grandmother's funeral and gives his foul-mouthed, wild, estranged, Army-veteran grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) a ride to Boca Raton, Florida. They encounter Shadia (Zoey Deutch), gay Bradley, and Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) at a road side diner. Lenore needs Dick as a professor to complete her sexual trifecta. Jason recognizes Shadia from his photography class. Dick is on the prowl and Jason is horrified.Robert De Niro as Andrew Dice Clay may be a funny idea on the page. It doesn't come off as funny on the screen. It is a simple exercise in against-type casting but that's not enough to be funny. I try to imagine another actor in De Niro's role and it's still not funny. I can see some improvements but De Niro's persona is not the only problem. This type of movies needs heart. This one has none and suffers for it. The movie probably knows the problem since it keeps bringing up grandma. It's the same note over and over again. There is no likability in any of the relationships. The inappropriate humor has limited fun but I don't care about any of these characters.",Dirty Grandpa
2,Prismark10,Meet the grandpa,3,13 June 2018,"With a title like Dirty Grandpa, you can fathom this is a crude, low brow comedy. It wants to shock you and beat you with a serious message of having fun because life is short. The trouble is it is not funny with a rather generic and forgettable plot. A lot of the crude comedy has been done before in those Hangover films and its rip offs.Jason (Zac Efron) is a bland corporate lawyer engaged to hectoring Meredith (Julianne Hough) who is even more boring. When Jason's grandma dies, he gives his grandfather Dick (Robert De Niro) a ride to Florida after the funeral. Dick is foul mouthed and on the lookout to have sex so soon after his wife has died. His crude behaviour shocks Jason who catches his grandpa jerking off to porn. Dick meanwhile is appalled with his straightlaced grandson who is following in his father's footsteps. Dick thinks he is getting married to someone unsuitable. He should be having fun, deep down he thinks his grandson is a free spirit. Dick wants to have fun after 40 years of marriage and life is short for him.Jason encounters Shadia (Zoey Deutch) an old college friend who he finds a genuine affection for, when he is not getting into scrapes and scraps with his grandpa who himself is romancing the much younger Lenore (Aubrey Plaza.)To my kids, Robert De Niro is the guy from those 'Meet the Parents' series of comedies. When I was younger De Niro was the guy from Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, The Deer Hunter, The Godfather II. We would debate whether he was the greatest actor in the world.Dirty Grandpa just shows that Hollywood doesn't know what to do with old great actors like De Niro and Pacino who seemed to have been reduced to making embarrassing comedies. Maybe Sean Connery and Gene Hackman had the right idea by just walking away from the industry.",Dirty Grandpa
3,nogodnomasters,Can I touch the Fuzzy Bee?,8,26 February 2018,"At Grandma's funeral Dick Kelly (Robert De Niro) asks his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to drive him to Florida from Atlanta. Jason hesitates as he is a corporate lawyer and is getting married to Meridith (Julianne Hough) in a couple of weeks. Straight laced Jason discovers his Grandpa has a few vices along the way as circumstances takes them to Daytona during Spring Break with an old college friend (Zoey Deutch) and her girlfriend (Aubrey Plaza) who has the hots for Grandpa.The film digresses from a unique crudely hilarious film into a Hollywood formula romance as the humor tapers off with stale gags. Aubrey Plaza was better than Viagra in her role. The film makes fun off societal norms in favor of the drug filled, save the planet and party bunch...but then that is to be expected. Funnier than most teen sex comedies minus all the gratuitous nudity.Guide: Plenty of swearing. Brief sex. Very brief nudity.",Dirty Grandpa
4,sunwarrior13,Raunchy And Crude Comedy That Surely Achieved Its Objective,8,29 May 2016,"Many viewers have called it as the worst film made by Robert De Niro.Others have said that films like this and the choices that the legendary actor made in the recent years have been hurting his legacy.Meanwhile critics have collectively trashed this film in their reviews especially at RottenTomatoes.com where it only have a 10% approval rating with one critic saying that Zac Effron's ass isn't enough to save this film.For other viewers who isn't into crude,raunchy and adult humor, they trashed this film as simply offensive.No question that it could even be a strong contender for 2016's Razzies particularly for the Worst Film Of The Year.But what makes films like this worth viewing and watching?Robert De Niro and Zac Effron star in a film that manages to entertain.While the humor in it was crude and raunchy,it never made any effort to hide what it was when it was released in the trailers. It was evident that its main objective was to entertain and make the audience laugh.The script written by John M. Phillips was obviously lacking in depth and it was basically your predictable and clichéd story about the relationship between a grandfather and a grandson in Dick Kelly and Jason Kelly respectively.I felt that in spite of the characteristics of the screenplay,it definitely did managed to entertain especially if one is looking for a raunchy and crude comedy.De Niro as always was great in his role as the dirty grandpa while Effron was good enough to complement him as Jason.Ladies will definitely feel entertained seeing his butt and abs exposed.As for the other characters,they were alright particularly Julianne Hough, Jason Mantzoukas,Danny Glover and Dermot Mulroney.But great credit should be given to Aubrey Plaza as a the scene stealing Leonore.Her sex scene with De Niro at the conclusion of the film will truly amaze many viewers.In the end,the movie was made to entertain and for that reason alone it deserved a good rating for it achieved its supposed objective.",Dirty Grandpa
5,CinemaSerf,It does what it says on the tin....,5,1 December 2020,"Yikes, it's a coming of age film - for just about everyone concerned. Robert De Niro is an ageing gent who, having just lost his wife of 40-odd years - is intent on letting the badger loose. To that end, he recruits his rather straight-laced, soon to be wed, lawyer grandson ""Jason"" (Zac Efron) to drive him home. The journey proves anything but straightforward as they hit Daytona Beach on their road trip, meet a pair of lively girls and their gay pal and have some escapades that opens the young man's eyes to the aspirations of his grandad and, increasingly, of himself. De Niro has a bit of previous with this kind of role - though it's certainly more in your face than, say, ""Meet the Fockers"" (2004); the language isn't just a bit blue, it's fairly graphically explicit as he seeks sex with a perfectly willing girl Efron's age and at times it's actually quite poignant as he refuses to allow his age to consign him to the scrap heap. The humour is crass an a bit puerile, though - and the film really shows up the limitations of Efron as an actor. He is terribly wooden and never looks comfortable even when naked and high on drugs. The story tries, quite pitifully, to reconcile some more serious elements into the script - grandad is a Vet whose family don't know, is dysfunctional and that scenario is supposed to lend it some gravitas. Well, it doesn't. The ending is a twee, poor amalgamation of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994) and ""Smokey and the Bandit"" (1977) that left me squirming in my chair. Both stars work well enough together, and fans of both/either will probably enjoy De Niro's refreshing frankness that epitomises that age is no barrier to having sex, and Efron - well he gets his ass out a few times. That's about it....",Dirty Grandpa
6,grantss,Much better than expected,7,26 February 2017,"Jason Kelly is a young, upwardly-mobile lawyer at a law firm in Atlanta. His grandmother has just died and his grandfather, Dick Kelly, needs someone to drive him to Florida. Little does he know that Dick really just wants to go to Spring Break in Daytona...From the promos this looked pretty juvenile. It is, sort of, but works. The main reason that it does so is Robert De Niro as Dick. He gets the best lines, particularly some great put-downs and banter, and delivers them perfectly. What's more, the humour isn't all of the puerile variety and there are some clever punch-lines and scenes along the way. Quite subversive at times too.Plot is pretty basic and predictable but it's not bad. Overall, well worth watching, unless you're someone who is easily offended and/or has no sense of humour.",Dirty Grandpa
7,oscaralbert,"It's ""Let's give Grandma a Thrill Week"" . . .",6,27 January 2016,". . . at the American Multiplex now, with a beefcake tag-team from Yesteryear comprised of Travis Bickle (a.k.a., Robert De Niro) and Troy Bolton (that is, Zac Efron) whiling away an hour and a half. Throw in many Non-threatening floppy Johnsons and topical come-ons from the 1900s such as ""I Like Ike!"" and my theater at least quickly featured a lot of Post-Megyn-Kellyish ladies rolling in its aisles. Grandpa sires a baby at the advanced age of 72. How cute. But let's be real. The last camera I bought cost $9.99. The antique device that Grandpa Dick says cost him three months of his reduced-by-inflation Green Beret pension does not look as practical. So if the buying power of Grandpa's government stipend is $35.96 annually NOW, then when Baby is 18 and needs that first year of college tuition, 90-year-old Gramps (a.k.a., ""Daddy,"" too) will be lucky to afford contributing a pencil toward Junior Junior's Higher Education. How do you like Dem apples, Granny?",Dirty Grandpa
8,neil-476,"DeNiro slums it: films is not without merit, though",7,22 January 2016,"On the day after his wife's funeral, Dick Kelly prevails upon his grandson Jason to take him to Florida. Jason – conventional, lawyer, getting married next week – rapidly discovers that his plans and best intentions are being resoundingly flouted by his grandfather, who seems determined to sow the wild oats which were kept in storage during 40 years of marriage.This comedy – which contains absolutely no surprises whatsoever in terms of plot: you can predict the ending from about 5 minutes in – is interesting chiefly by virtue of seeing DeNiro, one of the greatest actors of his generation, slumming it in a foul-mouthed, lowest common denominator, sex-obsessed comedy which is aimed primarily at teens and 20s ie. the people Hollywood pitch this sort of film at. And for much of the early part of the film, during which the script mistakes profanity for wit, this is unedifying stuff. I am sure there are funnier ways of expressing DeNiro's reawakened sex urge than having him repeat ""I want to f***,"" over and over. And saying it five times doesn't make it five times as funny as saying it once. DeNiro does what is required of him without ever appearing to be invested in his character: one for the pension fund, maybe. Efron is along for the ride, but offers a little more.There is stuff to be enjoyed here, though, and it mainly comes from the supporting players. Not from the two ""comedy"" cops – misconceived from the start – and not from the drug dealing shopkeeper Pam. But Julianne Hough, with the singularly unsympathetic part of control freak fiancée Meredith, is very funny delivering an overperformed song at the wedding rehearsal, and Aubrey Plaza is simply wonderful. I'm not a big fan of crudeness and coarseness for the sake of it, but Plaza takes that and makes it very very funny, especially when it is combined with a gift for making it sexy at the same time. The last time I found something both hilarious and raunchy was Jamie Lee Curtis stripping in True Lies: Plaza is equally funny and hot here.One has to admit it is a little sad to see DeNiro in this sort of film but, for all its shortcomings, the film pleased a young audience in a fairly full cinema.",Dirty Grandpa
9,anaconda-40658,Bad Grandpa is Funnier...and Dirtier!,5,10 February 2016,"Dirty Grandpa (2016): Dir: Dan Mazer / Cast: Robert De Niro, Zack Efron, Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza, Julianne Hough: Basically Bad Grandpa recast but without the reality reactions thrown in. Zack Efron plays an uptight lawyer who arrives for his grandmother's funeral only to learn that his grandfather wants him to join him on a spring break run. Robert De Niro plays the grandfather of questionable tactics. He steers his grandson into so many bad places that usually result in waking up in jail. Efron ends up high on drugs and jeopardizing his engagement when he falls for a would-be photographer. Efron enjoys some humorous moments as he constantly lands in hot water because of grandpa, and De Niro plays this aged individual as someone unwilling to grow up yet still desires the best for his grandson. The screenplay is a total dud and relies on its engaging leads to carry it. Zoey Deutch is stunning but cardboard number who ends up hooking up with Efron. She doesn't know of his engagement but that is the screenwriter's afterthought anyway. Aubrey Plaza steals scenes as Deutch's friend who ends up in the sack with De Niro because she loves screwing around with elderly folks. Julianne Hough has the thankless role of fiancé who gets to sit at home, make wedding plans, and lame phone calls because the screenplay calls for her to have the personality of a brick wall. The film emphases the relationship between grandparent and grandson but Bad Grandpa was riskier and far more engaging. Dan Mazer's film makes for a nice spring break vacation that could do without all the clichés. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Dirty Grandpa
10,FlashCallahan,Shabba!! (sticks finger in an orifice).......,3,3 May 2016,"Robert De Niro, what an actor. The Godfather Part II, Heat, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, The Mission. His body of genuinely excellent work is almost exhaustible.But now his body of really doing it for the pay check work is quickly becoming on par with his excellence.Jason is one week away from marrying his boss's daughter, putting him on track for a partnership at the law firm.When Jason is tricked into driving his grandfather to Daytona for spring break, his pending affairs are suddenly in jeopardy.Between parties, bar fights, and a drug induced night of karaoke, the titular Grandpa is on a quest to live his life to the fullest and bring Jason along for the ride.It's not a film as such. Yes it has some narrative where Grandpa wants to live his twilight years like he's an eighteen year old again, and make his once loving life Grandson do what he wants to do in life, and not get stuck in a rut like his own son.It's just a series of sketches featuring De Niro doing his best to keep a straight face whilst trying to 'get it on' with someone who is young enough to....well, you get the idea.The tone of the film is set when Efron walks into his Grandpa's house and finds him watching adult material.And that's just the beginning.For the rest of the film, we get the two attending parties, getting drunk, being accused of literally exposing themselves to young children, and in turn, it all happens to Efron, with De Niro watching on in glee, and Efron beginning to realise that he may me making the biggest mistake in his life by marrying into his work.It really is tepid stuff, De Niro is at his lowest ebb here, and Efron, just looks bewildered by it all.It's not funny, we have one of the guys from the brilliant pod-cast How Did This Get made pop up every now and again, putting in the best performance of the film, but he's just there to add to the narrative 'Hey Kids......Drugs make spring break wonderful!!!'.It's beggars belief to wonder what 1990 De Niro is thinking in a parallel world.Not good.",Dirty Grandpa
11,phd_travel,Crossed the line from funny and crude to just painful and crude,1,5 September 2016,Robert De Niro's comedies are usually okay from funny to moderately entertaining. I've always found him more versatile than Al Pacino in that he can do comedy well. But this movie is just terrible. I know most of the comedies aimed at young audiences have crude sex humor or they won't succeed. I also realize actors often have to take what roles they get even established ones or they won't be on screen. But somewhere along the line someone must have realized this was bad. Even Zac Efron looked uncomfortable in this exploitative nonsense.The premise about a grandpa dragging his proper uptight grandson for spring break has potential. With all the generation gap jokes they could have made this one funny. But this movie has hardly any funny parts. It's just crude and painful.The saddest thing is this was a box office smash. Reflects badly on popular taste in comedy.,Dirty Grandpa
12,zetes,"Lousy, but with a couple of highlights",4,29 May 2016,"Awful, awful comedy, but I love some of the actors in it so I had a morbid curiosity. Honestly, the script just plain sucks. I have no clue why Robert De Niro (whom I didn't watch it for, by the way - his judgement has been so bad for the past 20+ years you can just assume his movies are going to suck) would sign onto this. You have to admire his commitment, but the whole old-person-has-potty-mouth act was old decades ago. Plus, it's not just that he's dirty, he's mostly unlikable. The biggest problem with the film is that it's saddled with the hoary ""dude is marrying a bitch"" trope, which is always lame and fairly sexist. Funny thing is, the other girl Zac Efron falls for in the film, Zoey Deutch (the cutey from Everybody Wants Some!!), is every bit as boring as the girl he's engaged to (Julianna Hough). Efron himself isn't too bad as the straight man, but he works better in goofier roles. I saw this mainly for Aubrey Plaza. She's hot as Hell in this movie, and has some funny line readings, but I'm just too squicked out by her lust for Robert De Niro. I almost threw up in my mouth a couple of times. So yeah, almost everything here sucks, but there are two big exceptions: Jason Mantzoukas and Adam Pally. Mantzoukas plays a nutty drug dealer named Pam (""it's a nickname. It's short for Pamela"") and he brings a lot of life to the picture whenever he pops up. Pally (Happy Endings, The Mindy Project) doesn't get as much to do, but he gets a laugh even with the smallest line, and he has the movie's best gag as he has to act as a messenger between Efron and Hough at their wedding. I'd almost say it's worth watching just for Mantzoukas and Pally if you're a fan of either of them. The rest of it is bad, but I've seen far worse.",Dirty Grandpa
13,StevePulaski,Feels like a gaggle of prepubescent boys wrote a screenplay with all the four-letter words their parents told them they couldn't say,3,23 January 2016,"""Dirty Grandpa"" is the latest in the line of vulgarian comedies that tries to succeed off of a cheap formula. The formula is that it's so vulgar, tasteless, and irreverent that, eventually, by chance or by fate, it will get a laugh out of its audience. It may only be one, it may only be two, it may be only every ten minutes, or even more sporadic and inconsistent than that, but it will eventually get a laugh or two out of you. The problem is the entirety of those laughs often amount to about a minute or two of actual comedy, and in this case, enduring the remaining ninety-six minutes is quite an arduous task for such a feeble reward even a monk would pass up.With that being said, I counted two hearty laughs in ""Dirty Grandpa,"" and several sporadic chuckles from Jason Mantzoukas's rowdy and zealous performance as a local small-business owner/drug dealer in the film. That latter fact already sends up quite a few read flags, as this is a comedy where the emphasis rests on the age-gap and the talent of the two lead performers, Robert De Niro and Zac Efron respectively. While the two men exercise what seems to be a lack of boundaries and restrictions on what they'll allow themselves to be put through in this film, none of this particularly helps their credibility and further distracts both from the wealth of more interesting roles they could be taking.The film revolves around Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), a lawyer who is looking to wed his longtime fiancée in a little over a week. After the death of his grandmother, Jason's grandfather Dick Kelly (Robert De Niro) asks if he could potentially drive him to see his old Army buddy and have some grandfather/grandson bonding. Despite the time-crunch, and knowing how distant his grandfather and father are, Jason takes him up on his offer and drives him in his fiancée's pink car, which Dick refers to as a mobile labia.It only gets better. While eating at a diner, Jason runs into Shadia (Zoey Deutch), an old friend of his, who is eating lunch with her friend Lenore (Aubrey Plaza), an unapologetically crass woman who is looking to complete her sex trifecta of having sex with a freshman in college, an alum, and a professor. Dick, in turn, comes to her rescue by claiming to be a professor and promising to show her a wild time. The gang winds up enduring a ribald weekend involving drinks, sex, and drugs, most of the latter supplied by the aforementioned Mantzoukas's Pam character, who exercises maximum comic potential in every scene. The way he steals the attention away from the two leading performances is very similar to how Bobby Moynihan's prankster Alex character did in last month's ""Sisters."" The problem is ""Dirty Grandpa"" is so reliant on the repeated use of four-letter words that it forgets that the characters, the context, and the conversational wit of the circumstance is the reason why most of us laugh. It's not the repetition as much as it is the characters that we like and admire getting repeatedly thrust into circumstances they do not want to be in. Director Dan Mazer and screenwriter John M. Philips cruelly miss this point, and instead deliver a comedy hellbent on giving us maximum antics and minimum laughter, as a result.""Dirty Grandpa,"" while never boring and admittedly having the ability to squeeze us for one or two good laughs, doesn't understand the first thing about the functions of comedy, and feels like a gang of sugar-rushed, prepubescent children wrote the screenplay and compiled it with a list of words their parents explicitly told them they couldn't say. It's a waste of time for everyone involved, particularly Efron and Plaza, who have so much potential that's going to waste in this vacuum of ridiculous and desperately unfunny comedies. Both actors have already paid their dues forward with lackluster comedies, Efron with ""That Awkward Moment"" and Plaza with ""The To-Do List,"" so their choice to do this film is questionable. As for De Niro, I think the idea that ""he could do worse"" or ""he has given up"" stops hear. There were a lot of jokes that landed with a ""thud"" in this film, but the loudest was De Niro metaphorically hitting the bottom of the barrel, especially coming off of the wonderful ""Intern.""",Dirty Grandpa
14,KineticSeoul,Whatever,6,18 June 2016,"You know the movie ""Bad Grandpa""? Well it's kind of like that to a slight degree except with a actual narrative. And it's not a crude and obnoxious. As a matter of fact the Bad Grandpa had just the right line of crossing the line and just living the life and having fun. This movie is basically a wake up call for youngsters and a existential movie for the older people. As a matter of fact the Robert De Niro played a fairly cool Bad Grandpa. From the trailer I thought this would be a crude movie with a old guy trying to party with the youngsters in Daytona beach. But there was somewhat of a heart in it that worked for the movie as a whole. I guess I am now sort of numb to movies like this because it just all comes off as overly formulaic and predictable. I still give this movie a 6 out of 10.6/10",Dirty Grandpa
15,Hellmant,You can never trust an average critic's opinion on comedy; they don't understand humor!,8,19 February 2016,"'DIRTY GRANDPA': Four Stars (Out of Five)Raunchy comedy flick, about a conservative (and extremely uptight) lawyer; who's tricked into driving his sex-crazed grandfather to Florida, for spring break. The movie stars Robert De Niro and Zac Efron, as the two leads; and it costars Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza, Julianne Hough and Dermot Mulroney. It was written by John M. Philips, and directed by Dan Mazer (a veteran writer/director of the TV series 'DA ALI G SHOW'). The film is filthy, and very offensive (at times), but it's also hilarious!Jason Kelly (Efron) attends his grandmother's funeral, a little over a week before his wedding. At the funeral, his grandpa, Dick Kelly (De Niro), asks him for a ride to Florida; the following day. Jason reluctantly agrees, much to the disappointment of his very domineering fiancé (Hough). Once the two get on the road, Jason discovers his grandfather really just wants to party; and have lots of sex. Jason slowly begins to come out of his shell, and grow into another person; in the process (of course).The movie has been pretty successful at the Box Office (it's made $63 million, on an $11 million budget), and viewers mostly seem to really like it. Despite this, it's been slammed by critics. I often question the validity of modern critics, these days, but especially when it comes to comedy; you can never trust an average critic's opinion on comedy (they just don't understand humor). Especially not when it comes to raunchy slapstick, like this. The script is brilliant (it was listed in the 2011 Black List!); it's also lead to it's writer being hired on to co-script 'BAD SANTA 2' (he seems perfect for that)! The performances are all great (especially De Niro, who's having a great comeback recently) and Jason Mantzoukas (in a hilarious supporting role). The only place the film is really lacking, is direction; but this film doesn't need 'top quality' for that. It's a very funny movie!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M",Dirty Grandpa
16,thesar-2,Really Bad Grandpa,2,17 May 2016,"I don't know what's worse: a clichéd, homophobic, humorless and foul- mouthed film that should've been released 25 years ago, or the same movie released today that never knew when to quit.Horribly miscast, desperate swearing and predictability even from someone who has never seen a movie before doesn't begin to describe this movie. Admittedly, and scornfully I will attest to, I smirked a couple of times during this tragedy. Yeah, there were a couple of times I thought and felt: ""Well, that almost worked.""But, for the most part, this mismatched, zero-chemistry Grandfather/Grandson duo literally just spewed out every curse word, stereotype, hatred and formulaic scene they could muster just to get this experience over with. Want proof? Just watch poor Zac Efron who looked uninterested throughout this entire film. Seriously, he looked depressed, distant and as if he was in a completely different movie. And Robert De Niro? He rebounded with the fantastic The Intern toTHIS?I guess if Keanu Reeves spent a life being a bad actor and can pull of John Wickonly to stoop even lower in Knock Knock, De Niro can find his way back to bad movies after redeeming himself.I digress. In this depressing tale of one widower's crude quest to get laid out of state and out of his own league without any comedy attached, we're supposed to feel something for his grandson and his realization that his fiancée is just as bad as the script itself. Along the way, I suspect we'd have a heart for the fake redemption(s,) but no. They were just as thoughtless as the writers.Okay, it's not the worst road-trip movie I've seenAll About Steve is evidence of thatbut it's just so unfunny with all its miserable attempts at crude humor. Nothing worked here. Nothing was fresh or to the point. It almost looked like both Zac and Robert hated each other off-set and maybe they did. Hell, even the ""love-interests,"" Zac and Zoey Deutch had no connection. We were just told they loved each other and I guess we were supposed to give them the benefit of the doubt.Look. Listen. I am no prude. I love a good raunchy comedy. But, I also like it when actors show they want to share the screen together. I want to have it intermixed into a deeper story that doesn't rely solely on potty humor for the sake of ""shocking"" audiences. And I would like to see actual heart from both the writers and actors on screen.This sad excuse held nothing of value and should be skipped. Unless Unless you just wanna see Zac's butt a couple of times. Then, by all meanslearn to skip ahead.***Final thoughts: Stupid me. I kept getting this confused with the superior Bad Grandpa. I'm not a complete follower of the Knoxville set, but that movie did have me rolling more than a dozen times. I did not laugh once during this. And aside from Neighbors (I or hopefully, II) isn't Zac just gonna go away like Shia did? Let us pray",Dirty Grandpa
17,FeastMode,my notes,8,30 June 2019,"This movie is HILARIOUS. there were so many times where I was dying of laughter. there was a lot about the movie that didn't make sense, but I don't care. It was so funny. Deniro is awesome for doing this movie (2 viewings)",Dirty Grandpa
18,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"De Niro trying to be funny again, and failing worse than ever",2,29 September 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Dick Kelly's (Robert De Niro) wife passes away after forty years of marriage, and his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) who's about to qualify in a law firm and will marry his beautiful but controlling fiancé Shadia (Zoey Deutch), comes home for the funeral. He is shortly thereafter tricked by his grandfather into heading off on a debauched cross country trip, where Dick unleashes his long suppressed wild, hedonistic urges, much to the chagrin of his beguiled grandson.When he first came to prominence in the 1970s, Robert De Niro went on to forge a successful career, with powerhouse performances in intense, hard hitting crime dramas and thrillers that solidified him as a tour de force in the acting world. It was a reputation that served him well, meaning if he didn't always get the most variation, he could at least be relied on for such roles, that he sometimes won Oscars for. Yet over the years, he ill-advisedly seems to be trying to re-invent himself in a comedic manner, and Dirty Grandpa is the unholiest culmination yet.Although he often played ruthless, psychotic characters, De Niro always carried himself with a certain quiet dignity, on and off camera, that set him apart as a star. All of that is totally thrown out the window with this crass, vulgar, dim witted film, that he feels completely out of place in. It's like the most desperate, barrel scraping attempt at succeeding as a comedy star that was building up like a preventable catastrophe, and is here in all its gory non-glory.There's no discernible, coherent plot to any of it, it just lumbers from one set piece to another, occasionally managing the odd funny moment, mainly out of surreal absurdity (i.e. De Niro performing a karaoke rap song!) that sometimes lightens the runway, but it's mostly a long plot less, jokeless mess that, in spite of its star power, actually has the indignity of being bettered by a Jackass production, in the shape of 2013's Bad Grandpa, that orchestrated far funnier laughs, and actually developed a disgusting but far more endearing lead character. *",Dirty Grandpa

Robert De Niro has done disservice yet again to an illustrious career  in film, but I can't even call this piece of trash a film. It's poorly  written and horribly offensive. I'll keep it short because there's no  need to waste more time of my life thinking about this garbage film.  The film stars De Niro and Zac Efron who play the grandpa and grandson  respectively. Sadly the promising aspects the trailers had of them  having a fun and raunchy dynamic are overpowered by insensitive jokes  and incredibly stupid gags. There's every type of silly and lazy humor  including overdone sex jokes, poop humor, clichéd dick jokes, and yes  even fart humor that is horribly misplaced. I don't think I've ever see  a film take aim at everyone from gay and lesbians to people with  disabilities so insensitively. It's not even like its playful humor  that can work within a story, its small one liners that feel completely  forced and raise the hair on your skin for the wrong reasons. There is  a scene in which Efron's character sings karaoke and of course I  immediately thought of High School Musical series. I would have rather  watched any of those 3 films four times in a row before watching  another scene from Dirty Grandpa. Yes, it's that bad.  Aside from all that, there is but one redeemable thing from this movie,  that being Aubrey Plaza. Her strange and yes very awkward dynamic with  De Niro, who is set on having sex with her, can be at times funny. But  nothing from this film will make anyone laugh out loud. The plot is a  jumbled mess that does nothing to further its characters or story. I  can go on and on but the point being, don't go see this film. It's a  waste of just under 2 hours which felt about 2 hours long.  +Plaza...I guess?  -Offensive humor  -Why are there fart jokes?  -Writing is all over the place  -Unbearably awful  1.5/10",Dirty Grandpa
20,cosmo_tiger,Efron and De Niro had good chemistry but Aubrey Plaza really shines and if not for De Niro would have stolen the movie.,7,16 May 2016,"""Most grandpa's just want toffee."" Jason (Efron) is about to get married and start his new life as an impressive lawyer. At the funeral of his grandmother he reconnects with his grandpa Dick (De Niro). When he asks Jason to drive him down to Florida Jason thinks it will be a quick trip, then he shows up at his grandpa's house and everything changes. This is a movie I was extremely curious about. Sex comedies like this are usually funny and entertaining to watch, but this one had De Niro which seemed very odd to me. I have to admit, he was very very funny in this and brought something that most characters in movies like this don't. Believability in the serious aspects. The jokes are really nothing new, but De Niro delivering them make them that much funnier and I laughed a lot through out, hard. All of the actors had great timing in this, Efron and De Niro had good chemistry but Aubrey Plaza really shines and if not for De Niro would have stolen the movie. This is nothing all that original but it feels new and fresh with the addition of De Niro and is very much worth seeing for that reason. Overall, De Niro really shows his range; from Godfather 2 to Raging Bull to Goodfellas to this one...and he again shows why he is one of the greatest actors of all time. I give this a B.",Dirty Grandpa
21,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,4,15 May 2016,"Dirty GrandpaSpring break is convenient for senior citizens because they already all live in Florida.And while the vulgar elder in this comedy isn't there yethe's on his way.Straight-laced lawyer Jason (Zac Efron) rekindles his relationship with his grandfather, Dick (Robert De Niro), at his grandmother's funeral. During their interaction, he agrees to drive the widower to Boca Raton. Much to the chagrin of his fiancée (Julianne Hough), Jason and Dick hit the road, where Jason learns his grandpa's personality matches his phallic name.From drugs and alcohol to felonies and coeds (Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza), Dick's determined to enrich his grandson's stuffy lifestyle.The timeworn tale of an eccentric mentor edifying an uptight pupil but drenched in geriatric semen jokes and soulless performances, this raunchy road trip is both equally pointless and repugnant.Moreover, when you have unprotected sex with an old person you're liable to contract liver spots.Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",Dirty Grandpa
22,The-Sarkologist,De Nero is a Grandpa!,6,29 January 2016,"Well, I guess that all I can say about this movie is that it is basically another one of those frat party films. You know the ones where a bunch of young people go off and have a party and the main characters meet women with whom they fall in love. Yep, it's one of those films. Oh, and there is a fair share of rather dirty jokes, and scenes, as well as copious drug references. So, I guess the question is, why did I go and watch it? Easy – Robert De Nero.I have to say that all I knew about this film was that it was about a grandfather who takes his grandson on a holiday to Florida days before his wedding – typical Hollywood plot – seen it a few times before. However one thing that caught my eye right at the beginning, when he was doing chin-ups, was the tattoo on his back. Right away I worked out that he was ex-special forces (typical De Nero), but since his grandson never blinked an eyelid meant that he was either completely obvious about its meaning, or he already knew. Turns out that he is completely oblivious.Anyway, there is a little bit more to that story than that. You see De Nero's wife had just died, and Effron is a junior in his father's corporate law firm and is about to marry a complete control freak of a woman. Once again typical Hollywood plot. Anyway, De Nero decides to take him to Florida, on the pretence that he went there every year with his wife, and since he has lost his license he needs somebody to drive him, so he decides to grab Effron (as opposed to the drugged out brother). There is a reason for this, and that is that Effron is about to make a really big mistake.You see this is one of those films that suggests that one should actually live life and pursue one's dreams. Effron is basically heading down the road of your modern day corporate zombie. Sure, he might have a good job and live a comfortable life, but in the end he will be married to a control freak and be basically a robot controlled by both his wife and his father. De Nero knows better (since he is the Grandpa), and realises that Effron is making a really big mistake, so he decides to give him an experience that he never had in college – Spring Break.Sure, the whole concept is a debaucherous drug-fuelled binge, but the thing is that it is not about getting wasted, it is about having fun, fuelling your passions, and marrying a woman with whom you will actually live life rather than exist within a semi-dead existence where your life, in the end, will be meaningless. For all of the criticisms that I may have against Hollywood, films like this do say one thing – life is to be lived, to be enjoyed, and maybe the left wing socialists know it better than the right wing conservatives. Sure, maybe I'm not a big fan of the debaucherous drug-fuelled parties, but at least I know one thing, and that is life is meant to be fun, and if we have the opportunity to have fun, then maybe we should take it. Who knows, we might end up changing the world for the better.",Dirty Grandpa
23,Reno-Rangan,"The usual, nothing innovative about it!",3,4 June 2016,"Everything I wrote was just my personal opinion, definitely not intended to offend anybody. This should have been one of the best comedies of the year, but now it belongs to one of the worst. I recommend 'Grandma' instead this which I felt a much better comedy.At this age, Robert De Niro was unbelievably awesome, though his character needed a good support from another and that's where as usual Zac failed to deliver his part. I would have preferred someone like Taylor Lautner who's desperate for a breakthrough than the Zac who ruins always.The screenplay was from the 'blacklist', knowing this they should have been more careful while casting for it. The story was okay, because it was not meant for one of the greatest films of all time. It was sort of a weekend getaway or the bachelor party theme, but the film gives its original reason and then those developed plots were too familiar if you have seen plenty of teen films, in the party theme.It's supposed to make us laugh, but there are lots of outdated humours tried in the unusual route to narrate them. The grandfather-grandson combo was an excellent idea, the main plot revolves around them and it should have remained that way, but the undetermined romance was an interruption. Or they should have developed a decent romance track for a better balance in the genre.At least it would have been all right if it was a teen film. Many of those who appeared in it were actually too old to represent the roles given to them. That's fine too, because films are fake, everything is make-up and performance, but none were at their best except De Niro and Aubrey Plaza. It is definitely a film to skip, that's my opinion, but they're a few who are defending it, so be careful that I'm not always right and they're not always wrong if you want to choose it.3/10",Dirty Grandpa
24,sol-,If you thought 'The Intern' was too sweet...,6,25 September 2016,"Recently widowed and set on living life to its fullest, a septuagenarian tricks his grandson into driving him across the country in this lowbrow comedy starring Robert De Niro and Zac Efron. The plot is strikingly similar to 'The Intern' with its elderly protagonist wishing to find purpose after his wife's death, however, whereas some commented that 'The Intern' was ""too sweet"", 'Dirty Grandpa' is the polar opposite. The gags are mostly vulgar, with more than a couple coming off as existing simply for shock value (who would ever think that we would watch De Niro pleasure himself one day?). Some of the crude parts are admittedly very funny though, such as an angry parent on the beach. The chemistry between De Niro and Efron comes off as very real too, give or take their tendency to converse in expletives. In any case, biggest drawback here is the predictability of the story rather than its humour. Efron (of course) reevaluates his decision to marry so young while on the road trip and (of course) he meets an attractive alternative girlfriend who he (of course) loses and has to win back. It is a pretty generic storyline done countless times before. The presence of De Niro renders the film somewhat more unique though and to his credit, he truly embraces the role and runs with it. And with De Niro radiating such energy, it is a shame that the script rarely rises above gross-out humour level.",Dirty Grandpa
25,Floated2,Goes over the top for shock value,3,6 February 2017,"Dirty Grandpa sees Robert De Niro, as the grandfather on spring break in Daytona with his grandson, Jason (Zac Efron), who's wedding to Meredith (Julianne Hough) is days away. After the funeral of his wife, he insists that he and Jason drive him from Atlanta to Boca Raton, and that it be the very next day, since that's the day he and his late wife always went to Boca. Naturally Grandpa is out of control now that he's single for the first time in four decades, grief being no barrier to going on a hunt. Jason ends up partying at Daytona Beach for Spring Break where he also meets with another woman.What eventually occurs in Dirty Grandpa are a slur of outrageous gags and sex/homophobic jokes, and many jokes that are far over the top intended to offend and shock it's viewers. I think that the film has succeeded in that sense, and there has been a majority of critics reviews and common fans alike which sound rather offended by this film. There are a few funny moments and some laughs but things are still very predictable and not as enjoying as this film should have been. One can see why this film has already seemingly been forgotten. As a rewatch 06/30/19' opinions remain same, Dirty Grandpa isn't that funny and much of the comedy is forced, with a predictable result.",Dirty Grandpa
26,leonblackwood,More silly than funny! 4/10,4,29 May 2016,"Round-Up: It's really has been some time since De Niro, 72, has made a decent movie but he still is a highly rated actor, due to the success and amazing performances of his previous movies. He can afford to make some mediocre movies, because he has proved that he is truly a bankable star but it hurts to see him make a fool out of himself on the big screen. The masturbating scene near the beginning of the movie, along with the uncomfortable sex scene towards the end, just didn't look right and I'm getting a bit fed up with seeing Efron parading his body in his movies. Anyway, this film was directed by Dan Maze, 44, who also brought you I Give It A Year and 6 episodes of Ali G in da USA!!!. He certainly pushed De Niro to the limit in this film but I don't think that he brought out the best of the leading stars. I can't see them bringing out a sequel but at least it made a hefty profit for this directors first major project.Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $100millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Robert De Niro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch, Aubrey Plaza, Jason Mantzoukas, Dermot Mulroney, Julianne Hough and Danny Glover. 4/10",Dirty Grandpa
27,videorama-759-859391,A dirty grandpa of badness,3,28 February 2016,"Yeah, there will be a few people, unforgiving at Robert De Niro's choice of movie here. But it may die down, eventually. Some will still hold a grudge match of their own. There's always one really bad movie to start the year, and this is it. It seems De Niro's career has reached rock bottom here. You can't fault his acting here. He can still do a hell of a job, if given bad material, and granted, this could well be the worst film, he's ever done. On the whole, looking at the movie, it comes across as quite a mess. But I can't deny there were some killer comic moments, with additional laughs, though it's not overly funny. Laugh moments, come and go, but many, funny intended lines, misfire, a sad thing I've seen in a lot of other bad comedies. After his wife's wake, dirty Grandpa, De Niro, can't wait to get back in the, you know what and tricks his clean cut, grandson, (Efron, surprisingly good, if better than De Niro, honestly) to take a trip down to Florida for some poontang, where Efron meets an old girl friend, and De Niro's one thing, is to lay the friend's deliciously hot girlfriend (Aubrey Plaza) who just heats up the screen, with too, such a colorful performance, really utilizing her character, she too surpassing De Niro. DG is a trashy and degrading movie, and that goes for some of it's characters. Plaza's is intriguing at moments. Even in it's last scene, that inevitable sex scene, in the waiting, it retains it's degradation, and refusal to cut back in grossness. If you can't predict what happens here, may I suggest, you get a brain enhancer. You almost feel like a shower after seeing this, to be honest. It really goes for the grossness, with no holds barred tongue cursing from De Niro, where one early scene, featuring his old naked self, you will retain that disgusting image for a while to come. It's limitless ends of grossness, is really the one admirable quality, if we call it that, in what is really a bad, bad, movie. If almost for a redeeming moment, we're very gladdened by Danny Glover's appearance as an old retiree friend of Deniro's, if really the only unsullied moment of the film, but that too is quickly cut short, as even Glover drops to low depths, in his vocabulary. Watch it though, for Plaza.",Dirty Grandpa

29,subxerogravity,It totally lives up to the name!,6,25 January 2016,"I though Robert De Niro and Zac Efron made a pretty good comedy team, A very weird and unlikely one, but good. I will say, there was a time long ago when doing a movie with De Niro met you were going to a higher level as an actor. Too bad for Zac Efron, it's been years since that was the case with De Niro spending his golden years phoning in his performances for anyone with a big enough pay check.This is too bad, because Bobby actually gave a pretty good performance as the Dirty Grandpa who spent forty years with the same woman, of which the last ten she was dying of cancer, and now that she's gone, he wants to have sex again and needs his Grandson, A nose cleaned lawyer with a stick up his butt (played by Efron) to help him.They gave Robert De Niro the best, Dirtiest jokes in the movie and he delivered them with a gusto you'd expect from a Oscar winner. Second best lines were given to Aubrey Plaza, who killed it as a wild Spring Breaker looking to add some old man action to her sexual conquest.It's not good enough to win any comedy awards but it's good enough to watch. It has decent material delivered by an A list actor bringing his B minus game, and Efron gets naked for the ladies. Something to look at if you don't want to think for a few hours.",Dirty Grandpa
30,jtindahouse,Efron lets it down,5,28 January 2016,"I remember a few years back (around the time 'Hide and Seek' was coming out) critics and fans alike were saying how frustrated they were that Robert De Niro, one of the greatest actors of all time, was just doing comedies and horror movies and wasting all his talent. He seems quite comfortable with his career choices though and he does actually have a lot of comedic talent, so to me it's not really a waste at all. 'Dirty Grandpa' however really takes things to the next level. It's R rated and uses every bit of allowance it's given. I think a lot of audiences will be quite taken back by just how far De Niro goes with his character. The idea to shock them like this could have worked, if only it weren't for the complete lack of chemistry between him and Zac Efron.A number of the jokes are well written and would have looked hilarious in the script, but fall completely flat when they're actually delivered in the film. Efron became a household name after the 'High School Musical' films, but now it seems filmmakers don't really know what to do with him. They want him in their films because he's good looking and well known, but he doesn't have the acting chops to pull off a serious role, so he falls back into comedic ones. The only problem with that though is that he tends to suck the funny out of those as well. I think with a better actor in this role, one that De Niro could have played off a lot better, this could have been something special. Sadly, as it stands, it's not much more than a very offensive and occasionally humorous flick that will be pretty quickly forgotten and not do much for the careers of anyone involved.",Dirty Grandpa

The movie is bad, but it has fun with it's badness, the filmmakers knew this and they let the audience know it also. I could easily go along if the movie was has funny, which I gotta say it wasn't. There where some moments where I slightly laughed a little, but the film itself feels like it's making itself up as it goes on.The raunchy gags are just thrown in your face, there is no timing to any of it, that is what made it not real funny for me. Robert De Niro seems to be having the best time being this foul, sex crazed old guy. But Zac Efron playing the straight guy just wasn't very convincing, his role in Neighbors(2014) worked better cause he didn't have to try so hard. The jokes fall flat, there are gags with hardly any pay offs. Julianne Hough is just wasted here, Audrey Plaza is the biggest fail here, I was expecting so much more from her, instead she comes across like she got drunk before filming her scenes, seems like she doesn't really understand the crude jokes she says. De Niro is alright, but he deserves a better than this.But I gotta say, it's worth checking out, Dirty Grandpa is one of those films you gotta see to believe.",Dirty Grandpa

There is not a lot of original material here, but I like the actors and laughed enough that I enjoyed it. Robert plays a retiree that has just lost his wife-and I don't mean in Wal-Mart or something, she passed away.

Zac and Robert meet Zoey and Aubry who just happen to fit their needs as everyone gets into all sorts of shenanigans and secrets are spilled.

35,kirbylee70-599-526179,"Crude, Rude and Occasionally Funny",6,25 May 2016,"I can't seem to pinpoint when it exactly began but comedy took a turn for the worse within the last decade. Then again perhaps it was PORKY'S that changed comedies from movies with well thought out dialogue to simple jokes about body parts and how they are used. Whenever it began the truth is most of these movies have moments where you laugh at some of the most obscene things occasionally but for the most part just wonder how they keep being made.The latest in this long line of off-color comedies is DIRTY GRANDPA starring Zach Efron and Robert DeNiro. Yes THAT Robert DeNiro. I know, it's stunning to think of what many considered to be the actor of his generation now in a film where he's trying to bed a hot college co-ed. And yet here we are.Efron stars as Jason Kelly, an up and coming attorney about to get married to the boss's daughter Meredith (Julianne Hough). As the film opens he's at the funeral of his grandmother where his cousin Nick (Adam Pally) acts inappropriate between sexual comments, conspiracy theories, drinking and smoking a grass filled ecig. After the funeral Jason's grandfather Dick (DeNiro) guilts him into driving him across from Georgia to Boca Raton, Florida.What should be a bonding between grandparent and grandchild begins with Jason finding his grandfather masturbating followed by what most would be considered an over usage of the F bomb as he tries to get Jason to help him find someone young to have sex with. The best chance of this is a coincidental meeting in a restaurant with a young woman Jason went to school with, Shadia (Zoey Deutch), and her two friends Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) and Tyrone (Brandon Mychal Smith). This trio is headed for Daytona and Dick convinces Jason to head there as well.What follows is the usual debauchery one expects with spring break in Daytona, a drug and alcohol fueled exploration of beaches, bars and hotel rooms with nothing but attractive men and women in the tiniest of swimwear. During a drinking contest with two addle minded lacrosse jocks Dick considers competition for his chance with Lenore he slips several crushed capsule he has with him in a drink to slow them down. Unfortunately Jason ends up drinking this cup, the result of which is him disappearing only to resurface drunk out of his mind and wearing only a stuffed animal over his most sensitive area.More sequences like this happen and in the middle of them we learn that Jason wanted to be a photographer at one time, Shadia is an environmental activist and that the pair have a mutual attraction. Tell me you can see where this is leading. The weakest part of this movie is the feeling that you've seen this before, the same exact story, but with slightly altered settings and moderately modified characters. I know every time I saw cousin Nick in this film I kept expecting to discover he was now being played by Zach Galifianakis. Perhaps that's the worst thing about this film, the extreme predictability of it all from the plot line to the characters involved. If you've guessed which is the shrewish female in the bunch then you know what I'm talking about.I was reading a book the other day discussing film comedies and how they've changed, how in recent years most comedies have become guy films: crude, rude, loud and drug fueled. The few exceptions to the rule, comedies with female leads, have still found the need to have the same characteristics. To me that's sad. Perhaps it's just because I'm older. If I were a teenager maybe these movies would all seem like soon to be classics to me. Somehow I don't see these as being movies kids will look back fondly on when they grow older. Or mature.The production value of the film is top of the line. The performances are well done. Yes there are a few laughs to be found here, even among the crudest moments. But the film relies on those and the more shocking the funnier some will think they are. A shock laugh is the easiest laugh you can get. It's why the greatest comedies written don't resort to that.As the movie began I really hated it. The overly used formula was written all over its face. I knew the ending of this movie 10 minutes in and I wasn't surprised when it happened. But as it went on I found myself laugh now and then, more than I'd care to admit. By the end I felt that I could say it wasn't bad but it wasn't anything I'd remember down the road. If you're easily offended then by all means steer clear of this one. If this type of film makes you laugh you may even want to add it to your collection. For most of us in the middle of that road, we'll watch it once, laugh occasionally and then forget it a month from now when the next film like this comes out.",Dirty Grandpa
36,cekadah,Should have been titled 'Zac Efron Runs Around Nekkid',1,31 January 2016,"Dirty Grandpa (Dick Kelly) played by Robert De Niro is the 'also story' in this limp wet attempt at comedy. The plot is more about Jason Kelly, played by Zac Efron, tuning into his wild side while being well entrenched into the American lawyer corporate image lifestyle. So grandpa is mostly in the background being 'old age naughty' while Mr. Efron gets to run around 'butt nekkid' strung out on booze and drugs. (Do you think this little 'used tissue' of a flick was made just to show off Zac's fabo body?) YES!The movie is unfunny start to finish.

However, I was able to get through the movie and found some of the material to be funny and somewhat entertaining. Robert Deniro does well in a comedy and he is great here, the rest of the cast, not so much. Dirty Grandpa is a barrage of dirty, sexual humor. Some of it is funny, a lot of it isn't. This is a case of quantity over quality, less jokes and better character development would have made this much better. It also would have played better if it had a darker take on the material. Overall, I agree with people that Dirty Grandpa is pretty dumb and will most appeal to the lowest common denominator. But, hey it is a comedy and for modern comedy it is pretty average. However, you could do a lot worst for an evenings entertainment, but I doubt I will watch this again and if I want to watch something like this, I think I will watch Back To School instead.",Dirty Grandpa

Zac Efron nicely balanced the duo that the story flowed naturally. It's worth a mention that even though the movie's plot is dependent solely n the perverted jokes, I think that it executed them in a decent way that it didn't feel disgusting like most dirty comedies do. The acting in overall is not a really good one, mainly due to the fact that it's only Efron and De Niro who's cranking up the real performances, while the rest of the cast are only there for show.",Dirty Grandpa
41,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Dirty Grandpa,5,22 January 2016,"Hello all readers. I just saw Dirty Grandpa earlier today. Critics everywhere have been ripping it left and right. Now I can't say that I want 102 minutes of my life back. I do however, feel remorse for humoring myself in bits and pieces during ""Grandpa"". I have one word to recount my disposition: Ugh!Anyway, actor Robert De Niro is rich, bored, probably needs a hobby, loves to act, and in the last fifteen years or so, seems to take on almost every script that comes his way. That's kinda what I gathered from watching his 78th movie (my first review of the new year). Bobby's integrity in time has steadily gone downhill but I doubt he gives a darn. I mean he's Robert freaking De Niro, two-time Oscar winner. In truth, he does a complete 180-degree turn from his lovable, senior citizen role in The Intern (one of my favorite films from last year) to playing a horny, perverted oldtimer bent on sleeping with promiscuous, college girls. Dirty Grandpa featuring De Niro and Zac Efron (he plays Robert's character's grandson), is one of the sickest, foulest, nastiest, and most vile comedies ever to come down the pike. I couldn't recommend it even if I had a gun to my head. Here's the thing though: If you're into crass, gross, and profanity-laden humor, it will sometimes make you laugh (out loud I might add). A 72 year-old man masturbating to porn, the same 72 year-old man singing Ice Cube (karaoke-style) while spouting off the n-word, a young, prominent attorney smoking crack and waking up half-naked on a beach (surrounded by beer bottles), and a female police officer putting a smartphone down her pants while taking a picture of her full vagina. God helps us. God help us all.Taking place in Daytona Beach, Florida (mingled with Atlanta, GA), featuring a hip soundtrack (songs by Nick Catchdubs, DJ Rebel, and R3hab), showcasing an ending that actually reminded me of The Graduate (I'm not kidding), and obsessing the audience with penises being drawn on people's faces, Dirty Grandpa is directed with a skewed moral center by Dan Mazer (he wrote 2006's Borat). There's an unnecessary cameo involving famed actor Danny Glover (he plays an old army buddy of De Niro's character), a bit of dialogue where Bob actually mentions defecating and Queen Latifah in the same sentence (gulp), and sexual innuendo literally up the wazoo. The story is as follows: Dick Kelly (De Niro) lives in the state of Georgia and just lost his wife of forty years to cancer. Every year during springtime, he went to Florida with said wife as sort of a prolonged tradition. Right after the funeral and to the dismay of his own son (David Kelly played by Dermot Mulroney), Dick vows to take his grandson (Jason played by Zac Efron) back to The Sunshine State for golfing and eventual high jinks (a la Daytona Beach). Jason reluctantly goes even though he is soon to get married. He is forced to help gramps get sex from an easy vixen named Lenore (played by 31 year-old Audrey Plaza). Zoey Deutch (Shadia) plays Efron's forgotten love interest and Jason Mantzoukas (from Neighbors) plays a whacked- out drug dealer who befriends them all.Now if you decide to take in a viewing of ""Grandpa"", know what you're getting into. Don't go expecting a sensory, crime thriller in the shape of 2012's Spring Breakers. Just think of this vehicle as a Spring Breakathon more along the lines of Very Bad Things (minus any real tension or anyone getting murdered). As for legend Robert De Niro, well he has too much fun playing Dick Kelly. It's as if he thinks he's expanding his acting repertoire by acting unprincipled in a ruckus comedy. Travis Bickle really needs to just check himself.In conclusion, Dirty Grandpa tries so hard for laughs that it either exhausts you, offends you, or just makes you feel like you need a shower (no pun intended). I liked the chemistry between De Niro and Efron in that they looked similar while seeming believable as grandfather and grandson. I don't think they'll dent their careers with ""Grandpa"" (Zac might unless Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising does well) but you gotta wonder why they would humiliate themselves for so much as a paycheck. I mean did De Niro actually read the script and think that it was okay to put his character's penis in Efron's character's face (in one scene) or get a young twentysomething pregnant (in another scene)? And did De Niro actually agree to say a line describing wrestler Andre the Giant and his fingering of several stacked females (apparently so)? Oh and did Zac Efron really think it was okay to have a young, child actor grab something from his waist area on camera (it was masked by the filmmakers to look like molestation)? That remains to be seen. Yes I sort of laughed during this movie but these sequences were not part of that laughter (the Andre the Giant line, well it just felt out of place). I felt queasy and unsettled more than anything else. Here's my rating: One star goes for Dirty Grandpa's $6 matinée price plus lounge seating at the local multiplex. Another star goes to director Mazer for trying to give ""Grandpa"" a sentimental edge involving long lost love and a rekindling between father, son, and grandfather. Overall rating: 2 stars. Dirty Grandpa is justifiably flowers in the ""dirt"" (thank you Paul McCartney).",Dirty Grandpa

44,bkrauser-81-311064,A Cast Full of Coasting Stars,5,28 January 2016,"If anyone ever wanted to see a raunchy, offensive and bacchanalian Spring Break comedy where absolutely every actor including our main lead is on autopilot, I hardily recommend Dirty Grandpa. The main conceit of the film is based on the idea that everyone young and old would love to see acting legend Robert De Niro acting like an irresponsible college senior. Not going to lie, I myself was intrigued by the idea while still aware that I was going to get a Wal-Mart bargain-barrel assemblage of d**k jokes. In that regard, mission accomplished movie; now if only Robert De Niro gave a darn.The movie begins with the wake of Dick's (De Niro) long-time wife. Jason (Efron) his grandson is a corporate lawyer set to wed a shrewish woman (Hough) who seems to decide everything for him, down to the color scheme of the wedding. Partially out of a fear of old age and partially out of a desire to see Jason liberated, Dick convinces Jason to drive down to Boca Raton with him because ""it's what your grandmother would have wanted."" On the way down Jason bumps into an old flame from college (Deutch), her libidinous best friend Lenore (Plaza) and their tag-along Bradley (Bowyer-Chapman). Dick convinces Jason to follow them to Spring Break and take part in an escalating array of tomfoolery.In fairness to Mr. De Niro if there is any actor on the planet who deserves to coast it would be him. His career spans sixty years. He has been nominated for seven Academy Awards (winning two) and has been an invaluable stable player to the likes of Martin Scorsese and David O. Russell. Even as he got older he had no trouble transitioning into challenging roles and even made the successful transition to self-parody playing his machismo to comic effect. This is the first movie I have seen him in where he seems completely aloof (that includes The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle (2000)), yet on his very worst day he's still does a better job than half the cast in this movie.There are multiple characters that could have had moments to shine; Danny Glover, Mo Collins and Adam Pally are so underutilized that they might as well have been written out of the movie. In fact, the only real stand out is Plaza who during the first and second act does a convincing job flirting with De Niro. She's profane, she's lascivious, she's ribald and we love her for it. Armed with a barrage of witticisms and blunt sexual innuendo, she's easily outperforms Zac Efron's boring straight man shtick and whatever the hell Jason Mantzoukas is trying to do.The main problem with Dirty Grandpa is it's vulgarity has nowhere to go. Few of the jokes manage to be funny and when they are they seldom further the story in any meaningful way. In-fact most of the gags just get in the way, and after an hour of setups that go nowhere, it started to feel grating. Let's face it, after the shock of seeing Efron waking up on the beach with a swastika made of penises and De Niro saying the N-word wears off, all you're left with is a boring and cliché script.Dirty Grandpa just doesn't live up to it's premise. It wastes the talent of its cast, the humor is scattershot and crude and the script is as cliché as a rated-R comedy can get. Literally everyone in this film is there for the paycheck and only Aubrey Plaza seems to be having any kind of fun. It is said that the script for Dirty Grandpa was on 2011's Black List; an industry survey that votes on the most ""liked"" un-produced scripts of the year. Surveys in years prior have included award winning movies such as Juno (2007) and Slumdog Millionaire (2008). If you ask me they should have left this turkey on the blacklist out of concern for the living.",Dirty Grandpa

47,Screen_Blitz,Occasionally funny but an odd attempt to establish a mismatched comedic duo,5,26 May 2016,"It's not uncommon for Hollywood's A-list stars like to be handed to highly questionable projects, films that leave you asking ""why?"". Robert De Niro definitely gives off an unusual (and brutally raucous) vibe here in arguably his goofiest role of his career, partially since he is not known for raunchy R-rated comedies and has spent most of his careers spawning in roles of serious subject matter. Zac Efron on the other hand, is no stranger to the hardcore comedy territory, such as playing a college fraternity leader in 'Neighbors'. These two actors collaborate for the first time in this raucous comedy directed by Dan Mazer, a film that's not terrible but certainly what labels a low point in their career. Zac Efron plays Jason Kelly, a high-strung lawyer in his way to marrying his boss's uptight daughter Meredith (played by Julianne Hough). With his wedding only days ahead, Jasok is asked to drive his widowed, loathsome grandfather Dick (played by Robert De Niro) from his house to Boca Baton, Louisiana. Along the way, they run into college friends Lenore (played by Aubrey Plaza), Bradley (played by Jeffrey Bowyer Chapman), and Shaudia (played by Zoey Deutch), and what was supposed to be an easy cross-state trip results in an odyssey of drugs, booze, and embarrassing mayhem while grandfather Dick go outs in search for a new love of his life. It's easy say Zac Efron and Robert De Niro do make quite an odd comedic duo at first glance. But the real question is do they make a successful duo here. To some extent, sort of. But it definitely isn't one that works as well as it should have. The two leads both have heir hilarious moments every once a while but a lot of time, they try way too hard and it's not always funny. Efrom and De Niro spend nearly the entire length spitting out raunchy dialogue ranging from sex jokes, genitalia jokes, masturbation jokes along with explicitly crude gags that often come off but forced though occasionally funny. Of course based on the title, the level of vulgarity shouldn't come to too much of a shock, except maybe the fact that De Niro indulges so far into the level and seems to have fun dropping a large horde of penis jokes. Possibly the most questionable element here maybe De Niro's flirtatious interaction with Aubrey Plaza who plays a college girl probably only a third of his age. The aspect may be funny but tends to be conceived as rather than off-putting than sexy, especially considering the fact there is a brief sex scene between the two (no nudity involved). In the end, the hilarity isn't particularly strong but could been enough to semi- distract viewers from the blatantly rushed storyline, but only if you watching Zac Efron get high on cocaine or De Niro drinking booze with college girls in bikinis. Dirty Grandpa marks a rather low point for the careers for both Zac Efron and Robert De Niro but definitely isn't what I consider one of the worst movies of this year so far. After all, it does succeed at least bringing some laughs. However, the effort of the two leads do not always prevail. For comedy fans, this film may be worth a try, but definitely won't please everyone, especially those who are looking for Robert De Niro in a more solid comedic form.",Dirty Grandpa

I think that for most people this doesn't fall into the category of humor and neither are the rest of the things that try to pass for humor in this horrible abortion of a feature film.Robert DeNiro should apologize to each and every person who has ever watched one of his films for making this load of horse manure.",Dirty Grandpa

51,phubbs,Dirty Grandpa,2,22 June 2016,"'I haven't had sex in 15 years and I wanna f*ck! f*ck! f*ck! f*ck!''Oh, so that's what this is all about??'Yes this is what this movie is all about, Robert De Niro's dirty grandpa character who has just lost his wife of 40 years, is now revealed to be a foul mouthed, booze obsessed pervert who wants to f*ck young girls. Its up to the young, clean cut and unaware Jason (Efron) to escort him from Georgia to his Florida retirement home. Aaand that's your movie in a nutshell people, sound familiar? Well that's probably because its been done a sh*tzillion times before.I mean honesty, who thought of this? who green-lit it? The entire concept is so cliché and dated, an old grandfather figure that turns out to be a dirty, loud mouthed, profanity spewing perv who also just happens to be an ex-special forces type so he can also kick ass if needs be. This of course means you're gonna get a sequence where he does indeed kick someone's ass much to the surprise of Jason his grandson. Naturally of course, the fact that grandpa is an ass- kicking, alcohol machine, means that the grandson character must be a total goodie goodie, a real preppy nerd type because its the perfect equal polar opposite match-up. Completely and utterly predictable, clichéd, corny and unoriginal, the characters literally lay out the ground plan for the plot without even having to write a single word of dialog for them. And yes you've guessed it, that plot simply revolves around lots and lots and lots of binge drinking at parties, girls in skimpy bikinis, pool parties, beach parties, drinking, drugs, lame pranks, drinking, sex, nudity, drinking, jail time, muscle flexing and plenty of drinking. This is basically the modern frat boy flick minus any originality because frat boy flicks were a staple diet back in the 80's. So this odd pairing drive off on this road trip of sorts in an attempt to reach Florida. God knows how far they actually get because the entire flick is taken up with the duo getting into various parties so grandpa can try and get laid. This is against the wishes of a shocked Jason of course but he usually ends up getting tricked or drugged into it, then winds up enjoying it, then winds up waking up somewhere hungover and naked...or in jail, take your pick. The whole time Jason is also trying to hide all this outrageous behaviour from his very sexy, yet very prudish fiancée and his conservative parents. Anyway all I know is at one point they get to Daytona beach in Florida, no clue how they got there or how far they still had to go, but who cares.Now in all honesty the casting for grandpa Dick with De Niro is pretty good. De Niro is the obviously the perfect age and he has that perfect persona where you're not really sure what he's actually like, he could easily be a dark horse. To that extent De Niro does the job well, as we know he's great at swearing and being tough, he still looks pretty tough, and he fits the rough ex-services persona well also. For all intense and purposes he could easily be playing yet another mobster type in a comedy, he never really swings too far from that schtick. As for Jason played by Efron, well to be honest the guy is too good looking and too muscular for this part. He isn't too bad with his comic timing and everything (surprisingly!), but when it came to sequences like the 'flex-off' on the beach and when he's generally topless, he's way too ripped! That's not a bad thing but I really think to get the right comedic affect they should of cast someone without a good physique, with bad hair, someone who's a bit geeky looking. That would at least be a good opposite to the rest of beach/party going extras who are generally all sexy boys and girls. The fact that Efron is way hotter than all of them kinda makes most of the sexual innuendo gags fall flat.I must point out one character played by some bloke called Jason Mantzoukas. Oh my f*cking God this guy was so f*cking annoying I could of killed him, literally killed him. Who is this guy? Where did he come from? Why is he being cast in movies? Is he supposed to be a funny guy? Holy sh*tstains this guy was dreadful, completely unfunny, everything just fell flat or totally missed the target by miles. His whole drug obsession spiel was just so f*cking clichéd, so old, so not funny! Yeah its so cool and amusing to do drugs or pretend to do drugs ha-ha-ha! Jesus Christ I was giggling at sh*t like this when I was a kid back in the mid 80's. Then you have the two corrupt cops, one male and one female, played by whoever, I don't care. Once again, completely not funny, not even close, just cringeworthy on every level, literally amateurish.Yeah so bottom line, this is a piece of sh*t, an unfunny piece of modern day movie garbage. Not even De Niro or Efron's perfectly tanned torso can save this, its dribble of epic proportions with not a laugh in sight. That is of course...the thought of seeing De Niro's cock in Efron's face sounds good to you? Or 72 year old De Niro's character having sex with a supposed 20 something college student (Lenore) and then having a kid together (making Efron's character the uncle to his grandfathers newborn son and a college slut his new grandmother). Oh and then there's the real classy dialog between grandpa Dick and Lenore...'You're gonna tsunami on my face', 'You're gonna flood like the Nile', Nice.2/10",Dirty Grandpa
52,RforFilm,"Dirty Grandpa has some funny moments, but the whole picture is inconsistent with it's party atmosphere",5,23 January 2016,"For those that are lucky enough to still have them around, spend some time with your grandparents. As children, they may have seemed foreign and even spooky with their wrinkled and used image, but adulthood should eliminate those phobias. You'll come to realize that age really does posses a golden amount of life experience that's ripe full of smart ideas that they wished they would have known a while ago. My eldest grandfather is ninety-five years old and a World War II veteran. You know someone with that background will have lots of stories that are worth listening to.It's also understandable that any grandparents talking to their adult grandchild will start to not only see themselves within their image, but even start to reminisce about what was good about being young. My grandpa has talked about that his one regret was that he didn't try harder to understand computers. He was never a high tech guy, but was really marveled at my LED television and how clear the football game was. I remember that my mother tried giving him the old family computer from the early 2000's, but he never got into it. Watch how one grandpa tries to reclaim his youth with his grandson in Dirty Grandpa.We start with Richard ""Dick"" Kelly (played by Robert De Niro) who is initially grieving over the passing of his wife who has succumbed to cancer. He and his family manage to pull through a nice ceremony while some of the younger ones see this as a meet and greet. Dick's grandson Jason (played by Zac Efron) seems like the one to have matured the most, with a lawyer job with his father, a yuppie wardrobe, and a controlling girlfriend Meredith Goldstein (played by Julianne Hough). As a grieving matter, Dick has asked for Jason to drive him down to his Florida home to spend some time with each other.Upon picking him up, Jason finds his grandfather more unclean then he ever thought of him. While having lunch, Dick reveals that he wants to go to Daytona Beach during the spring break season just so that he can attract a college girl. Along the way, they bump into a group of young adults including a woman who likes older men Lenore (played by Aubrey Plaza) and Shadia, a classmate of Jason's who knew of his photography passion. The trip to Daytona is crazy, wacky, and just the spark that not only satisfies Dick, but for the all too straight Jason as well.As you can tell, Dirty Grandpa is following the ranks of fellow party movies like The Hangover and Animal House. These can be hit or miss, but somehow, this falls somewhere in the middle. For one thing, both Robert De Niro and Zac Efron have great chemistry as a team. De Niro is clearly having a ball playing a filthy senior and it's strange to see Efron playing the yuppie type (he does it well enough). Plus I'll admit that there are some genuine sweet moments between the family as each try to connect and reconnect.If the relationships seem well, then what's wrong with Dirty Grandpa?Unfortunately, not all the gags work well enough. For one, there's a strange drug dealer character who has way too much screen time to justify his existence. Same thing with an oddball cousin whose just in the movie to curse and make sexual remarks. There are also moments where the movie just seems to loose track in order to make another pot joke or wiener gag. I laughed for a while, but it needed more then just a party to seem funny.I'll give this five Daytona Beach shirts out of five. I was laughing for a while, but Dirty Grandpa never finds a consistency with it's humor and story. But the gags I I found funny and to see De Niro and Efron act this way makes this a modest recommendation. If you know you can't take hard material like this, you'll hate it. But for those that can stomach much of the spring break material, I'm sure you'll find something to laugh at. It's just not the whole picture.",Dirty Grandpa

Has anyone in Hollywood cheapened their legacy more than Robert De Niro did when he took this role?The 'humour' is needlessly coarse and highly predictable. Pretty much every single gag in this movie has been done before (and a lot better). The level of acting from all corners is truly atrocious. Jason Mantzoukas was quite funny in The League but he really should have retired from acting after that as he is absolutely horrific in everything else. Zac Efron isn't the worst thing in this movie but he is terribly cast- he really doesn't work as a shy, humble prep boy. And as for De Niro? Well he could have been caught prostituting himself on a street corner and it would be less humiliating than this. Disastrous.",Dirty Grandpa
54,Vivekmaru45,It's embarrassing to write a review for such a film.,7,11 July 2016,"I've an open mind, but some of the things I've seen in the film takes the cake. I'm a Robert De Niro fan since his The Godfather Part 2 days. Since then, I have seen all of his best films: Taxi Driver (1976), The Deer Hunter (1978), Raging Bull (1980), Once Upon a Time in America (1984), The Mission (1986), Goodfellas (1990), Awakenings (1990), Cape Fear (1991), Heat (1995), Sleepers (1996), Red Lights (2012). He has starred in a lot more films than I can write here. These above are a good guide.Now the other actor Zac Effron, I know nothing about him. His acting is okay he is able to handle the many embarrassing encounters and events in the film. He plays the grandson of Dick Kelly an Army veteran. After attending the funeral of his grandmother, Dick personally requests that Jason drive him from his home in Georgia to Boca Raton, Florida.Watch the film to find out what happens next...I should warn you that this film is not like Meet The Parents(2000). This film is more R rated. At age 72 years Robert De Niro still has an awesome physique. He does some pull-ups in the film to prove the point. We have three very pretty actresses in the film: Julianne Hough, Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Plaza.First time director Dan Mazer has co-wrote and co-produced the films Ali G Indahouse (2002), Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006) and Brüno (2009).",Dirty Grandpa
55,bob-the-movie-man,De Niro - what were you thinking?,1,29 January 2016,"Michael ""Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"" Caine has never been averse to starring in more than his fair share of turkeys. Talking about ""Jaws: The Revenge"" he once said ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific!"" One can only assume that Robert De Niro has a similar attitude for getting involved in this dross.For that is what it is. Directed by Dan Mazar (""I Give It A Year""), its a desperate attempt at a Spring Break-style ribald comedy that misses at virtually every level.De Niro plays Dick (an appropriate name) who after a lifetime of marriage and on the day after his wife's funeral asks his grandson Jason (Zac Efron) to join him on a road-trip to Florida, with the singular aim of getting laid by a fresher a quarter his age. (You can already tell that this is all in the best possible taste). Jason - an accountant - is due to be married in the following week to the prissy and controlling Meredith (Julianne Hough), against Dick's wishes. Needless to say with this paper-thin plot, (and given that America is obviously such a small place) he runs into an old (and naturally sexy and gorgeous) school friend Shadia (Zoey Deutch). With Dick applying a 'certain set of skills' from his previous work (hasn't this plot been worked before in a De Niro comedy?) he wreaks maximum havoc in Daytona Beach in trying to lead Jason astray. Will he succumb and find true love rather than fall into a marriage of boring expectation.What's there to like in this film? Well, there is some almost amusing sexual banter between de Niro and the nympho-like Lenore (Aubrey Plaza, and probably the best thing in the film). The great Danny Glover has a short cameo. The music used is well chosen(although the music editing seems extraordinarily inept). And if you are female (or male but gay) then the extended scenes of Efron's almost naked body might do something for you.But on the flip side, there are few groups that this film won't manage to offend. About 75% of the script is the F-word. It portrays extensive and casual hard-drug use. The film is offensive to gay people. Offensive to deaf people. Offensive to cancer patients. Offensive to black people. And deeply offensive to lovers of cinema.I have used enough words on this trash. Those UK readers who are old enough to remember the older style of film classification will remember that there was an 'A' rating. I would bring it back for this film, the 'A' standing for ""Avoid"". In fact, it was so offensive, the rating should be 'AA' for ""Absolutely Avoid"".I have a monthly cinema card, so I got to see this film for 'free'.

57,ronakkotian,Outrageous scenes that make no sense,3,24 August 2020,"Never would I have thought to see De Niro do a film like Dirty Grandpa and here we are.Dirty Grandpa shows Jason Kelly take his grandpa on a trip to Florida and he soon learns that his grandpa isn't as clean as he thought.This film has humour that may offend tons of people. It's crass, gross and even shocking at times. It's crazy to think that someone as great as De Niro would do a film like this. Ultimately though, Robert De Niro is the best part of this film. Never has he been more vulgar and offensive but at times it does provide for some great jokes and his chemistry with Zac Efron is entertaining to watch. There are some moments which did get a laugh from but most of the jokes don't land since majority of them are so cheap. The story is something we've seen hundreds of times which makes it fairly predictable.What really annoyed me were some of the characters and the situations. Jason Mantzoukas as the drug dealer was so annoying. I hated how much screen time he got and everything that came out of his mouth wasn't funny. Adam Pally as Efron's cousin gave me the same feeling. Every time he was on screen, he was constantly irritating. Some of the situations De Niro and Efron get into would never happen in real life. It seemed like the script only added these situations for the sake of a joke but it just made the world of the film so unrealistic and stupid. Dirty Grandpa just feels like a collection of outrageous and shocking scenes that make no sense whatsoever.There isn't anything that makes this comedy special. It just tells you an abundance of cheap and dirty jokes. If you're looking for a film with an actual story that makes sense filled with characters you actually care about then Dirty Grandpa isn't for you.",Dirty Grandpa

59,CineMuseFilms,If you can ignore the inane smut you will find some laughs.,5,31 March 2016,"After watching Dirty Grandpa (2016) my first reaction was how quickly could I flush this movie from my memory? Top critics around the globe have panned it as awful, crude and unfunny, despite it starring the venerable Robert De Niro and quickly earning $90 M (USD) in box office from a $11.5 M (USD) outlay (beating many other well-reviewed films). Have the critics been overly swayed by the film's puerile humour, vulgar language and incongruous adolescent antics played out by a grandfather figure? And while we are talking ageism and gender equality, why has the foul- mouthed Grandma (2015) starring the also revered Lily Tomlin been reviewed so kindly when the story themes are not that different? With so many films featuring outrageous language, humour, and behaviour, could it be a bridge too far when a 73-year old cinema icon swansongs an illustrious career in such a subversive anti-establishment way?In genre terms, this is a standard father and son road film where self-discovery, redemption and familial bonding are the destinations, similar to the Nebraska (2013) narrative. Grandpa has literally just buried his wife after 40 years of marriage and uses the sympathy card to trick his estranged grandson Jason (Zac Efron) into driving the three-day road trip that was planned with his wife. Jason is an uptight conservative lawyer about to marry his boss's snooty over-controlling daughter and his future as a corporate partner appears secure. With the wedding only a week away, the trip becomes an odyssey of booze, karaoke, a beach 'flex-off', girl chasing and other bawdy behaviour. Grandpa calling their pink convertible Mini Cooper the 'giant labia' sums up the tone of the journey. Along the way, Jason finds his undiscovered self, revisits his closet ambition to be a photo- journalist, and his tidy life plans look shaky. The rest you can guess.Standard comedic stuff, you might say, sure to get a laugh. So what went wrong? This is another film that almost worked, but poor post-production decisions cost it dearly. Editing-out excesses of gratuitous profanities, juvenile hip-thrusting and other genital and coital references might have appeased the baying hounds and lifted this comedy to another level. But then it would not have been Dirty Grandpa. Maybe when grandpa De Niro says the trip is ""not about guilt but redemption"" he is referring to the casting straitjacket he has worn in so many films with this one his last chance to break out. While this film will not do much for the De Niro legacy, if you can ignore the inane smut you will find some laughs. Anyway, who says baby boomers cannot not let it out?",Dirty Grandpa

61,BrnzReviews,Funnier Than 5.9!,8,10 June 2021,"Dirty Grandpa; what a watch it was, I really enjoyed this comedy I found myself laughing at more of it than I had expected but then again if Robert De Niro wants to be funny he will be hilarious, depending on the role. This film is full of hilarious WTF scenes and the way the story comes across its very entertaining and i wish I could watch it all again for the first time. Zac Efron & Robert DeNiro are two actos i didnt think I'd get the privilege of witnessing and they literally go so well together, when an actor is good you can really see it, the chemistry is amazing between these two, such a grey watch, much funnier than its review 5.9 is pathetic.Ignore the bad reviews, this is a chucklesome, hilarious, outstanding omega about a man and his grandpa he just wants to F#$! And I think its funny as you'd never see this from a grandpa in a movie I guess the title does make sense.Highly recommended, I found myself intrigued in the entire story and wanted it to be longer. Very entertaining worth the add to your list, I saw it a while ago but it deserves a review on here.",Dirty Grandpa

63,jamiedarlow-37510,What can you expect?,4,7 April 2020,"Jason (Zac Efron) is about to get married. His grandmother has recently passed away and his grandpa Dick (Robert De Niro) is grieving but can't shake one of the last things she said to him; to go out and enjoy his life. After being emotionally blackmailed into going on a trip to Florida, Jason takes his grandpa in good faith to spend some quality family time but little does he know that all Dick wants to do is go on a rampant sex spree! Dan Mazer (I Give It A Year, Da Ali G Show) is the guy behind the camera calling all the shots here and he definately brings all the awkward gross out comedy of his prior work here while also bringing out a central double act in De Niro and Efron that is quite fun to watch at points. I thought Efron in particular is great in the moments where he smokes crack for the first time and has an epic party! De Niro is of course a legendary actor and much of the shock factor presented is the fact that you're seeing him say these unbelievably obscene things on screen and a certain image of him relaxing in a male fashion, shall we say, that will not leave the mind for some time! It is in pretty poor taste which isn't always a bad thing in comedy but it's main issue is it reminded me a lot of Mike & Dave Need Wedding Dates which was desperately unfunny and, although I did giggle a couple of times in this case, it does have a similarly uncomfortable air about it",Dirty Grandpa
64,asb_deutsch,"Very corny, indeed!",7,22 July 2017,"This is one of the best adult comedies I enjoyed. Come on, I thought DeNiro was so hilarious. I loved the scene where he punches Brandon Mychal Smith and makes him deliver silly dialogues. And thanks to Duke Dumont - Ocean Drive. His soundtrack is so nice- it makes me Hold on, Hold on, Hold on...",Dirty Grandpa
65,troyputland,I would give this a lower rating if I could.,1,4 February 2016,"Dirty Grandpa could possibly be the worst film of the year, and even up for worst film ever seen. This is due to several aspects, the biggest of these and hardest to comprehend is Robert De Niro stooping very low into toilet humour. His distinguished career, which includes Raging Bull, The Godfather: Part II and Heat, is tainted by this monstrosity. Dirty Grandpa is full of jokes about farts, sex, drugs and general stupidity. De Niro's unbearably crass and homophobic. He spends all his time jamming his thumb up his grandson's behind and swooning over young tot Aubrey Plaza, and just a day after laying his wife to rest. Maybe I'm getting too old for this kind of humour. All I know is Dirty Grandpa is shamefully racist and misogynistic, and probably without knowing. The black people in this movie are either gangster or homosexual. Hugely insulting. What's even weirder was most people were laughing at the screening I went to. It must be me.",Dirty Grandpa

67,jmoneyjohal,"A low IQ,raunchy sexy comedy that provides laughs thanks to Robert De Niro's crazy act",6,22 January 2016,"There is no real reason to talk about Dirty Grandpa in depth, the film is exactly what you see in the trailer, its raunchy, its wacky, its a hilarious sex comedy. It also is extremely clichéd, predictable, over the top, and the film has the most thin story line ever. But you excepted that already, the film provides however what it was mainly made for laughs . Its a stress buster film, and yes there are many things that bog down the film occasionally but at the end you enjoy yourself while watching Dirty Grandpa.Its also a film you feel that you have watched before, because while the jokes are not really new, what makes the film maybe a notch better then most sex comedies is Robert De Niro. This man is by the far the youngest man in the film, and he is outlandishly awesome, who knew the master of acting could play a wacky sexy manic grandpa to perfection, but more on that later.Story wise right before Jason Kelly's wedding, he being a uptight guy is tricked into driving his grandfather, a perverted former Army general, to Florida for spring break. What happens when Jason finds out his Grandpa just wants to get laid, and how he joins the party is what forms the rest of the plot of Dirty Grandpa.Acting wise Robert De Niro, is a revelation of sorts, who knew this man could play such a wacky, outlandish, and over the top character. We know he is one of the best actors ever, but he goes no holds bar for this film. He is so filthy its awesome, truly this man can do anything the acting sphere Watch out for his scene when he sings it was a good day by Ice Cube, that scene and many more scenes with De Niro had me laughing out loud. Zac Efron is passable as the pretty boy, when it comes to acting he has nothing much to do, other than show his body off, maybe he should try going to acting school.Critics have completely destroyed this film, its already being called one of the worst films of 2016, but I don't understand all the hate. Its way better than the fore night released "" Sisters"" which was accepted with open arms by critics. I don't know its beyond me why the film is getting such high hater. I mean the film is clichéd, predictable, has no real amazing story, its a low IQ comedy, as I stated before, but is that not what you excepted from the film after the viewing the trailer. Moreover the film entertains, and however many the negatives like having a dumb love track, the familiarity issue etc, for me De Niro's wacky act rises above anything. It was so entertaining watching him go full retard in a good way. And honestly I enjoyed the raunchiness, the low IQ, outlandish jokes. Its also never a bad sight when the film is crawling of beautiful women the whole time, and thats huge plus for male audience who want to watch the film. Tech wise the film has nothing knew you haven't seen before, its production values like the camera-work, the clothing, the cars, location etc are those seen in numerous other films. However the audience need to give the film a chance in my opinion if your a fan of wacky sex comedies.Overall Dirty Grandpa is no cinematic gem, honestly its a joke of a film, but I guarantee you will laugh in this raunchy sex comedy, and thats only criteria this film holds. Enjoyment is almost guaranteed. 3/5* or 6/10",Dirty Grandpa
68,themadmovieman,"Juvenile and stupid, but it could have been worse",5,27 January 2016,"This isn't a good film. It's a comedy with next to no good laughs, an excessively juvenile script, pretty average performances, and even production errors that you wouldn't expect of a Hollywood film. In short, I didn't like Dirty Grandpa, but I do recognise that, despite a lot of its more 'on-edge' jokes, it's not actually very offensive, and so, if you've really got nothing else to watch, can be seen with your brain turned completely off.And that's where I'll start. This is a stupid comedy, about the same level as any of the more average Adam Sandler movies. I never hated watching Dirty Grandpa, and although I was a little bored and checked my watch a couple of times, its silliness wasn't too annoying, and so it is watchable.There aren't too many strengths to this film, but the one thing that I really did like was Zac Efron's performance. Robert De Niro, Aubrey Plaza and the rest of the cast are disappointingly terrible, but Efron continues to impress as a comedic actor, following on from Bad Neighbours. Not only does he play the good guy really well, and is definitely likable throughout, but on the occasion that he has to do some physical comedy, he pulls it off, and is easily the most entertaining part of the whole film.But I'm being very generous, because Dirty Grandpa really isn't funny. With a screenplay that sounds like it was written by a 13 year old boy, 95% of the jokes fall completely flat, and just make for awkward silence which is left for you to laugh. Meanwhile, the shock value of De Niro's character acting like a teenager wears off within seconds, and, seeing as that's the entire crux of the film from start to finish, you can imagine how repetitive and unfunny it got by the end.Finally, it's not necessarily something that will have a huge impact on your enjoyability of the film as a whole, but, seeing as I was pretty bored at times, I began to pick up on a surprising amount of continuity errors. There are some unexpected things that just change at times, and yet nobody really mentions it, but that can be excused with some common sense, however there are genuinely some scenes where people are either wearing a shirt, and then a second later it's completely gone, or somebody is standing one way, and then in a quick cut, are in a completely different position that they couldn't have ever moved to in that time.Like I said, it's not particularly important, but when you notice these things, it tells you two things: it's a boring film (because I should have been laughing), and it's a lazy film.",Dirty Grandpa
69,danew13,A Low Point for De Niro in a Vulgar almost Plot Shy Sex Comedy,3,4 December 2016,"Dirty Grandpa in even below Spring Breakers as a nonsensical film with no coherent and well defined plot. Yet, even below this is the acting of the once great Robert De Niro and heartthrob Zac Efron, who will never achieve greatness with junk such as this.Oh, there were a few laughs...very few...but they were minimized by the horrible acting punctuated by vulgar and obscene language that posed as hip jokes. That vulgarity was accentuated by hot Aubrey Plaza, who seems to be forging an image for herself as a sex crazed bimbo via this epic and her previous outing with Efron, Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates, which was actually miles better than this film.On the plus side, there were a few hot looking women to take your attention off the stupid dialogue.",Dirty Grandpa
70,Avwillfan89,A river of raw sewage and mean spirits,1,27 September 2016,"In more recent years, I've never seen a more repugnant, nasty film. I needed several shots of alcohol to get through this and I still couldn't make it though to the end. It's line after line of rape jokes, child molestation jokes, homophobic jokes and misogynistic abuse. Why on earth do people think that stuff is funny? It's so disheartening to watch Robert DeNiro deliver one disgusting line after another to Zac Efron. He plays a recently widowed lustful senior citizen on the lookout for sex accompanied by his conservative grandson. All the while, I wondering: What was he thinking?None of the stuff that happens make any sense! The language and the way people speak to each other on screen is so over the top and unrealistic. If anyone said any of those lines to me on the street, I would punch their lights out. Simply put, it's absolutely un-watchable.

What critics seem to forget is this ""What is the story"" ""What is the category"" ""Does the film accomplish what it set out to do""? Well to me it is ""Yes"" to all the above. Now the film is not realistic but even reality shows are not real. In this film Zac Efron is taking his grandpa to Florida so his grandpa can see an old friend.

74,lnvicta,Know what you're getting into and you can have fun with Dirty Grandpa.,6,1 February 2016,"Once the credits started rolling for Dirty Grandpa, the only thing I could say was, ""Oh my god."" It was shocking. From beginning to end the movie is shock humor, gross-out humor, crass, offensive, childish and stupid. But you know what? I laughed a lot. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained throughout most of this movie. Sure, it follows a lot of road trip movie tropes and the perfunctory fight/make-up conflict near the end, but one thing about Dirty Grandpa is that it's consistent. Dirty joke after dirty joke; some of them hit, some of them miss, but they don't stop. Some of these things I never thought I'd hear come out of Robert De Niro's mouth, but the fact that it's him saying it makes it all the more funny. People will say this is a slap in the face to his legacy, but it really isn't. The Family was. Little Fockers was. This movie knows what it is - a lewd, politically incorrect road trip comedy, and it succeeds in that regard.What surprised me most about Dirty Grandpa is the chemistry between Zac Efron and Robert De Niro. They have a great comedic rapport that actually feels authentic, which helps the more insane scenes retain some semblance of realism (as thin as it may be). The rest of the cast is enjoyable too, especially Aubrey Plaza as the overtly slutty college girl who continuously surprised me with every grotesque statement uttered from her mouth. Oddly enough, De Niro feels right at home here. It's as if his character from Meet the Parents went off the deep end and decided to go on a spring break road trip with Zac Efron. Seriously, his character is ex-special forces and everything. Efron also proves once again that he's a comedic force to be reckoned with playing the straight corporate man put in awkward social situations.I don't know what people were expecting from Dirty Grandpa. Look at the title, look at the trailers. Are you really surprised? It was marketed as a gross-out comedy from day one, and guess what? It's gross. It's vile; it's degrading; it's shockingly inappropriate. Is it a good movie? Not a chance in hell. But the goal of a comedy is to make the viewer laugh, and Dirty Grandpa made me laugh. Hard.Now, if you don't like offensive humor, you should stay the hell away from this. Just know what you're getting into before seeing Dirty Grandpa and you can definitely have some fun watching it.",Dirty Grandpa
75,MichaelMRamey,Not The Best Raunchy Comedy,4,23 April 2018,"I saw this film because I have enjoyed Zach Efron in Comedies in the past and I'm a big fan of Robert De Niro. Unfortunately it ended up being just as blah as I figured it would from the trailers. I found myself checking out of this film periodically because it was just another film that had been done for with a slight alteration. We've seen this kind of movie time and time before and I guess the writers thought ""What I'd we add a Grandfather to the story?"" And then bam, you've got Dirty Grandpa.",Dirty Grandpa
76,SpoilerAlertReviews,Not going to be everyone cuppa tea but.. it's my kind of comedy,8,14 December 2016,"Dan Mazer, the director behind a lot of Ali G and I Give It A Year, also writes a lot, most recently Office Christmas Party and Bridget Jones's Baby with Brüno and Borat in his writing credits too, however, Mazer directs a story written by someone else, a fairly unknown John Phillips. Zac Efron plays the straight-laced lawyer boy, Jason Kelly who reluctantly agrees to drive his recently widower Grandfather to Florida, too soon. before his wedding. Robert De Niro slips comfortably into comedy mode and becomes this lecherous dirty old man on a mission to get himself laid, and possibly his grandson on the way. De Niro is stand-alone brilliant and steals the entire film. He's the Grandpa you're so ashamedly proud of, justifying his disgusting behaviour and attitude as he verbally slaps people in the face, sometimes physically. It's a role I can no longer see someone else do. He is the dirty Grandpa. What ensues is a totally wacky and hilarious road trip, not totally unbelievable, but way up there with silly over-the-top comical situations. Efron looks like he's been set up and pranked upon constantly, by his own Gramps who has quite a few tricks up his sleeve and possibly some state secrets too. The script is loaded with clever put-downs, mostly delivered by De Niro, with a heavy does of sarcasm. Plenty of awkward situations, and inappropriate embarrassments but without going to the extremes like some of the comedies released this year. It's just silly and the plot holes are quickly ignored due to the hilarities. Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Piaz pretty much make up the rest of the supporting cast, and the targets for De Niro, causing a major distraction for Efron who's soon to be married and cannot forget with the needy, dominating wife-to-be constantly calling for colour schemes, rehearsal arrangements and press releases. It's predictable but that doesn't ruin the film, it's like you already know the story and how it's going to pan out but it's then remixed comedy style which makes it forgivable. It doesn't pretend to be anything but a funny comedy. I've said before, all good comedies need good soundtracks, and this one is a great example of that, making full use of a suitable mixture to create the perfect atmosphere. It's proper laugh out loud funny, especially Jason Mantzoukas' Classic Pam. I suppose it's comedy I can kind of relate to, reminding me of my pals. It's a road trip with pals that's on always on form. Non-stop heckles, and pranks come-backs. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 9 Performance: 9 Direction: 8 Story: 7 Script: 8 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 just for Classic Pam.

77,lucasnochez,Film Review: Dirty Grandpa,7,3 February 2016,"Okay, I know what you all may be thinking, Dirty Grandpa, the newest comedy featuring Robert ""Refusing To Take A Pay-Cut"" De Niro is just another sad excuse of a comedy featuring a world- class veteran actor whose acting days are numbered and career is slowly fading? Actually, the fact of the matter is, Dirty Grandpa is a very funny, very over-the-top, very rambunctious comedy with nothing but entertainment value, laughs and some good old-fashioned Hollywood fun at the movies, poking redeem fun at itself following the heavy and highly melodramatic Oscar burdened December month. I can think of so many other disappointing January films that I've seen in the past, that quickly make way onto my list of Worst Films of the year. Luckily for Dick Kelly (De Niro) and his lawyer loving grandson Jason Kelly (Zac Efron), the two won't be making their way to that list. Filled with deadpan dirty talk, highly sexualize jokes, crude, rude and obnoxious taboo social references, Dirty Grandpa becomes one wild and dirty-minded fun filled trip to start off 2016.Not that the film should be a reflection of the film caliber of 2016, but Dirty Grandpa never becomes a film that falls and cannot get back up. Instead, the first comedy of 2016 tells the similar story to Pixar's Up; but instead of the adorable Carl Fredricksen taking a wild trip on his hot-air balloon, Dick Kelly decides that, after a fifteen years abstinence, and with the loving approval of his dying wife, the secret ex-Military man decides to trick his favourite grandson along for a ride to Daytona Beach to find some horny and foul-mouth twenty somethings in a pink Mini Cooper. Kind of the same thing, right?What begins as a simple guys trip with golfing, dining and some male bonding, quickly turns into a wild weekend looking for answers for both men; sensory for Dick, and emotionally for Jason, who is unsure about his marriage to the all too perfect and tremendously overbearing Meredith Goldstein (Julianne Hough), who ultimately becomes the sexiest Bridezilla we have seen on film in a while.Luckily for our unlikely duo, answers quickly come, in the form of Lenore (Aubrey Plaza); a wild mouth lascivious college girl looking to bone a senior for the sake of completing a life long list of hers; and Shadia (Zoey Deutch), a free-spirited, organic loving, tree-hugging hipster who is the complete opposite of Jason's Meredith. With the girls off to Daytona Beach, Dick begs his grandson Jason to pursue them, knowing that Dick is surely going to be able fulfill his dreams of sleeping with a college student. Luckily for the audience, the wildly uncalled for sexual banter between the doe-eyed Plaza and De Niro is what we look forward to the most, making their dialogue the highlight of the film overall. I mean, how funny is it hearing De Niro shout out things like, ""Party 'till your pregnant!"", or ""I got news for you. That's the only thing thats going to be pulling out tonight.""(speaking about a pull-out couch).While the trip to Daytona Beach is anything but smooth, the duo encounter a slew of college obstacles that get in the way of their overall goals of bedding the girls of their dreams; from wild crack smoking Macarena drug-induced trips, to chugging contests, to ""Flex-Offs"" against dim- witted college jocks Cody and Brah (Jake Picking and Michael Hudson), acting as the duo's main nemesis throughout the film, Dirty Grandpa is one downright messy, and we love it.Director Dan Mazer, the man behind writing comedy classic Borat and of course the highly bloated sequel-ish Brüno shortly after, does a decent job of delivering the laughs with a cast that could carry any movie and its comedic material any day of the week. Luckily for Mazer, Dirty Grandpa won't be a critical hit by any means, but commercially, with a mere $11.5 million dollar budget, the film will likely make a decent marginal profit for the director.Its rude, its offensive and most of all, the social satire here is totally tasteless, although it is really funny seeing an elderly De Niro asking a group of black street thugs permission of using the derogatory 'N' word while singing Ice Cube's ""It Was A Good Day"" in a Karaoke bar with his newly made 'homies'. Plus, when is a raunchy comedy not offensive? Obviously, if the film and its main sh*t disturbing protagonist isn't raising a few eyebrows, something is wrong.De Niro is Hollywood royalty and can basically do whatever he wants with little to almost no repercussions at this point in his career. So if Robert De Niro, a man who notorious for his contributions to film, The Tribeca Film Festival, New York City culture (including trendy NYC restaurants and hot-spots) wants to do a film where he wears and shows off his prosthetic penis on-screen, hey, Mark Wahlberg did it, why not De Niro? If De Niro wants to pose topless on theatrical posters with young and handsome up-and-coming movie stars on his back (and brag that he didn't need help doing it) and wants to spend the majority of a 102 minute film with his main piece of dialogue being, ""I want to f*ck f*ck f*ck f*ck f*ck!"", let the man do what he wants to do, because at the end of the day, how funny is it seeing De Niro scream out such profane things, and who would have thought they live the day to see it? Hollywood is such a wonderful place for veteran actors. I bet De Niro would never have thought this late in his career he'd have a young Aubrey Plaza twerking all up in him.Amen to Hollywood retirement. Glad to see Dirty Grandpa acting as a testament to that wholly bizarre notion. You go De Niro, you go.",Dirty Grandpa
78,schroeder-gustavo,I'm just glad it's over,1,20 March 2016,"I really don't have a problem with any genre of movies, even dumb juvenile comedies like this one, as long as they aren't dumb or terrible. This movie was a disaster in every imaginable way. It's a movie that's by the numbers and after the first 5 minutes you know everything that's gonna happen in the movie and maybe it would have helped if the movie was funny but there really isn't anything funny in this movie. I chuckled one time. The writing is terrible and pretty much everything about the movie is disgustingly bad. I want to clarify that there's a very big difference between good bad and bad bad movies. Movies like ""The Room"" are classics because they are so bad that you laugh at it because it's a complete failure and you enjoy it. But then there's bad bad movies where I really don't know how you can derive any enjoyment from it. This was bad bad. None of the characters are likable or even realistic. You can't identify to any one of them and you can't care about them because they don't feel like real people. The dialogue isn't realistic and the scenarios aren't realistic either. Every character in this movie feels either like a cartoon character or a straight up psychopath. The level of intelligence of the characters is basically zero. None of their actions make any sense and the whole movie just feels like a bunch of stuff happening for the sake of a joke and it's never cohesive. I literally have never said this before because I am really not insulted or offended easily, but this movie really was offensive and insulting. The difficult thing about reviewing a comedy is that it's really hard to pinpoint why something is funny or why it isn't, but this movie was definitely not funny. An example is in the beginning of the movie you kind of get to know the main characters cousin, who is just a total unfunny jerk and you don't see him for the rest of the movie until almost the ending. And the payoff to that ""joke"" happens like an hour later. So it takes way too long for them to get to the ""payoff"" and it doesn't work. That's the only joke I can think of that felt like it had a setup and at least attempted to have a payoff. Pretty much everything else was racist and homophobic jokes.It's pretty amazing how a crap screenplay like this can get sold but thinking about Hollywood it makes sense. It had the right stars attached to it with De Niro and Zac Efron so it appeals to a larger audience: De Niro for older folks and Efron for teenage girls who wanna see him shirtless for almost half the movie. It's a pathetic movie and it doesn't even deserve to be called a film because there's no coherence in the story. It's a movie that's clearly made to gain a profit and it feels like they shot it two weeks and it tries to make you think that the movie is about people and relationships, but it's not.I actually take a lot of personal offense with these kinds of movies because I happen to love movies and I know it's just a product made for a certain audience or for anyone who's dumb enough to pay for it (apparently including myself because I did) but I really found this movie offensive.I disliked every character in the movie and I genuinely hated the drug dealer and the cousin characters. None of the jokes worked, it was the most offensively stupid movie I have ever seen in my life. It never seemed to end, it was a nightmare. Dirty Grandpa is hands down one of the worst if not the worst movie I have ever seen.",Dirty Grandpa

Well, I guess there were a couple of scenes that were a little cringy, the whole shopkeeper thing was a little odd, and for that very reason I wanted to rate this a bit lower.However, De Niro and Effron were great together, and I'm becoming a fan of Deutch who I hope to see a lot more of. I also found myself laughing out loud quite a few times which doesn't happen much in movies these days, so for me the score was rising.Lastly, checking out a few reviews here, as you do, and I see someone called this movie offensive. I find it so excruciatingly sad that so many people these days are void of humour and find offence in just about anything. So I couldn't possibly give this movie anything less than a big fat 10.

81,palavitsinis,"Well, I like dirty, but this was too much",4,28 July 2016,"It's not unlike De Niro, no matter how great of an actor he is, to be part of such movies. I recently saw ""The Intern"" in which he was amazing although a somewhat ""soft"" and ""cheesy"" movie. I actually enjoyed this a lot. On the other hand, doing movies like this one is really beneath him, from my point of view. The movie was dirty and really provocative for the most part. It was. And it's OK sometimes. I am not the one to fluster with the jokes made in the movie or the lines heard. I actually liked many of them. But having said that, it seemed that the movie was tasteless at times, far from reality and just too sloppy. I mean, even if you accept that having such a grandpa is possible, there are so many things around that don't fit, that it's really annoying at times. I don't want to spoil it for the rest, so I won't go into any details on that. My feeling is that the concept and idea of the movie was really good, but the execution sucked. Having De Niro and getting him to act as he did, providing little if any depth to the role, is just stupid. Did not appreciate the ending as well, as it was too far fetched. A confused movie that will get some laughs out of you. It offers nothing more than the presence of De Niro and the chance to see Efron naked, or almost naked, which seems to be the only talent this guy has, after all. Waste of time.",Dirty Grandpa
82,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie,1,17 February 2016,"This is as bad as it gets. I do believe, this is the first time we've had a 1/5 star movie on the Autistic Reviewers page. It was just unbearable.The plot is simple: A man by the name of Jason Kelly is about to get married, and unfortunately for him his Grandfather, Dick Kelly has asked him to give him a lift to Florida. Jason thought his Grandfather was doing it for business, but little did he know he's doing this for a Spring Break. He has not had sex win fifteen years and he wants to ""F*ck* F*ck *F*ck F*ck!"" The whole script was just laughable, and not in a good way. The writing was horrible the acting was horrible (especially from Zac Efron.) Whenever Efron was acting it felt like I was watching High School Musical again. Except this was twice as bad. Deniro was about the only thing that made this movie watchable, and even he could not save this horrible movie! The characters are all unlikeable, they either just nonstop cuss or just get high. There's no character development what so ever. There's no reason for us to care about anybody in the film.I don't recommend anyone to watch this film, unless you really love watching people cuss, watching people get high and watching Zac Efron take his shirt off to reveal his ""steriod"" body while Deniro lifts him up in the air! Horrible. Sorry folks, but this movie gets a 1/5 stars from the Autistic Reviewers.",Dirty Grandpa
83,grahamvr,What a waste of time and money.,1,12 August 2019,"This is the second Zac Efron film I have seen this week on Netflix and I cannot believe he can lower himself to do such crap. What are Zac Efron and Robert DeNiro trying to prove? It's obvious by the box office how much people avoided going to see this. The director and writer made a hopeless, revolting, bad language film. If I has started counting the abusive language from the beginning in this I am sure it would total over many hundred words.Come on Zac, you are so much more capable of this, in THE LUCKY ONE you gave a wonderful performance and also in HAIRSPRAY, and THE TED BUNDY movie, but man don't destroy your career with the other crap you are doing.If this review makes it to the public I will be surprised.",Dirty Grandpa
84,Genti23,Actually funny,6,23 May 2016,"Dirty Grandpa is a comedy film directed by Dan Mazer and written by John Philips. The film stars Robert De Niro, Zac Efron, Zoey Deutch and Aubrey Plaza. After Jason's grandmother dies and just before his marriage, his grandfather asks him to go on a road trip to Daytona Beach, Fla., and there's where Jason learns a couple of lessons from his ""dirty grandpa"". I found this movie really funny most of the time and I couldn't stop laughing at a lot of the jokes. I suppose that a lot of these negative reviews for this movie are from people who think that this movie is against their ""morals"". But it doesn't really matter, cause Dirty Grandpa has been a box office success and a lot of people liked it, including me. Zac Efron is really funny, he has shown that he's got comedic guts over and over again. I am becoming a fan of as I keep on seeing him in these kind of movies . Robert De Niro is also awesome on the role all throughout. I also really liked the supporting characters, especially Jason Mantzoukas as a drug dealer who had me laughing every time he was on screen. Sure this movie isn't nowhere near a comedic masterpiece and nor is it trying to be. It is a fun ride from beginning to end, and despite all the clichés, the jokes are what make this ride worth it.",Dirty Grandpa
85,justinwfirestone,Mediocrity at it's best,5,24 February 2016,"Dirty Grandpa is not a good movie, but like Pixels, it's nowhere near as awful as the Tomatometer would have you believe. We are reminded that men are pigs, Zac Efron is attractive, and Robert De Niro likes money. I'd like to think of Dirty Grandpa as a biting social satire of how meaningless and vapid American society has become. If that's the case Spring Breakers did a far better job, but that doesn't mean we can't try again.The movie's ultimate failure is not that it's not funny (it's not, not really), it's that it runs around half-cocked and never takes the big plunge into the deep end on the way to oblivion. There are a couple of funny sight gags, but it does nothing to challenge the stereotypes it reinforces: sexism, homophobia, and the superficialness of human interaction.Efron is a terrible actor, here playing an attorney, I suppose. Everyone knows he can't act, so he never gets to say too much. Does anyone believe Zac could ever get through law school? And Grandpa's scheme is lame: he doesn't think Zac should marry his fiancée, so he finagles a road trip to party. Party on, drink too many drinks, smoke too many drugs, find a better mate, hopefully bone some chicks along the way.Mediocrities everywhere, I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you. I absolve you, all.",Dirty Grandpa

87,JPfanatic93,"Already the worst movie of 2016, easily",3,20 February 2016,"I had a tough time sitting this one out, for the simplest of reasons: it was bad. Real bad. Mind you, with a title like 'Dirty Grandpa', one would not have expected it to be much good to begin with, but this is a whole new level of badness. There simply are no redeeming features present.First things first, there are hardly any sympathetic characters. The titular old man is a horny pervert obsessed with getting laid and leading his son astray in a whirlwind of sex, drugs and general illicit behavior. The grandson is a wimpy control freak, set to marry a total bitch. On the way to Spring Break in Florida, they meet a bunch of co-eds, including a seemingly nice girl who we know the grandson ought to hook up with immediately, but who ends up stealing his money in her first scene. Her best friend is a total slut. Not to belittle female sexuality by using this word, but there simply are no other denominations as apt as this one. Add some drug dealers, corrupt police officers and loads of partying college kids who only want to get wasted and laid, and there you have the cast of Dirty Grandpa. You'll find it a real challenge to care about any of these people.What movie buffs would care about, is veteran actor Robert de Niro's career. Sure, he's done plenty of dramatic roles so he's entitled to have a little fun every now and then. But his audience, save for people who truly are cursed with a total lack of a sense of humor, simply won't enjoy Dirty Grandpa with him. This is just not a funny, well written or empathetic character. This old horndog has just lost his dear wife of 40 years and his first reaction is to go out and screw nubile young women. In the process, he wrecks his grandson's impending marriage (bad match though it may have been) and constantly humiliates his sexuality and belittles his character during their little road trip. This is nothing to laugh at, it's morally reprehensible. And even if this set-up would allow for some comedic potential, it's utterly wasted on an uninterrupted stream of genital jokes. There's not a single conversation between any two characters in this flick that doesn't involve 'cocks', 'asses' or other rampant assorted swearing just for the sake of swearing. Needless to say, it grows tiresome swiftly. Not to mention it's all talk and no action, save for a gratuitous shot of Efron being facially confronted with his grandfather's penis (obviously a rubber item). But when it gets down to it, the sex is tame and prudish. Or are you telling me American women really do keep their underwear on during intercourse? Question remains, why did Robert de Niro - or any of the actors and actresses involved for that matter, since they're all making total fools of themselves, and of us for watching their disgusting antics - opt to play this part? The script was obviously terrible from the get-go. Sure, there probably was some monetary compensation involved, but I do like to think an actor of his stature isn't so down on his luck he has no choice but to accept any and all projects, no matter hoe feeble, that come his way? Maybe he's just telling his fans to go screw themselves, tired of his fabled reputation and the pressure that comes with it. I don't know what his motivation was, but the result surely won't bring happiness to many audiences. Dirty Grandpa truly has nothing to enjoy. Okay, maybe Zac Efron's bare body for his fan base. But nothing else for sure.",Dirty Grandpa
88,stermix501,utterly disgusting,1,26 June 2016,"I am not a big fan of DeNiro, but still the fame of the overall casting together with the 6 IMDb ranking, convinced me that I should check this out. Unfortunately this was the worst idea of this year. In order to save my Saturday night I had to ran away of this after huge effort staying for halfway through. I'm 42 and far from being a puritan, but such movies are American cinema's decadence. Comedy is the most difficult genre. It is easy to write and make a drama, but what is difficult is to make a real comedy with real humor. Only English and a bit the French are still able to do this. American comedy has become a compilation of disgusting things including drugs and sexual fluids innuendos and raw images that could make you throw up. I'm sorry but seeing a 73y.o. person masturbating, even if he is the greatest actor of all time, or innuendos of pedophilia cannot make me laugh. Even if you can tolerate such jokes still the plot, characters and development is as dumb and shallow as it can be. An insult to the audience and to the cinematic art. I wish there could be negative stars to give 10.",Dirty Grandpa
89,Lomedin,So because I don't share your opinions I'm a hater...,1,4 May 2016,"...right? I have to like clichéd, predictable movies targeted for that niche audience of female rebel wannabes and male who likes it dirty but still want to keep a corny soft spot...So I am a hater because I don't find De Niro particularly funny, even if he's a good actor. I am a hater because I know how this movie ends within 15 minutes into it, once we are presented with the superficial and snobbish soon-to-be bride and her counterpart the rebel and independent chic who knows the groom from old days, when this poor actor, who is supposed to be somehow the main character but next to De Niro looks like a muppet, was still a dreamer who wanted to roam the world looking for adventures, something the grandpa doesn't take long to remind us within that first quarter of an hour, before the kid was pushed by his father and high class society to follow a more ""down to Earth"" career. It also doesn't take long for the alternative and open-minded chic to meet again this awesome boy now turned a leashed boyfriend, just when they are about to start their trip... Well, there you have it; the predictable ending is served.And so I am a hater because I don't find the supposedly dirty jokes funny, but by-the-book ""Along came Polly"" humor copycats (at least I find Ben Stiller funny, as well as a competent actor).Alas, this movie is unbearable, clichéd to the limit, and no amount of R-rated simple and easy jokes can change the fact of its null originality. Yet another run-of-the mill romantic ""comedy"" trying to be something that is not.It's a pity that De Niro is recruited for these movies in shallow roles with the kind of acting that is not his forte. It is clear, though, that he was cast for this trash as bait.Yeah, I am a hater; it's what hateful movies breed. If you want well made R-rated humour with a pinch of real romance without being cheesy, go watch ""Deadpool"". Although that might be too much for female rebel wannabes and their suffering boyfriends...",Dirty Grandpa
90,SimonD1900,Not fantastic or even good. But better then you would expect.,3,7 August 2019,"This movie had me laughing out loud a couple of times, perhaps 3 or 4 times. Robert De Niro and Zac Efron are both great in this and great together also.
Zac Efron plays this successful but uptight guy, that's having to hang out with his dirty and somewhat crazy grandfather, it's a fun idea for a comedy. Many can relate in some way and it's always fun when old people act out with no inhibitions for some reason.
But this movie sadley became ridicules as it went along and followed the exact same formula many other american movies of this type done before, which to me, made it so much more uninteresting and just silly and predicatble. Which was a shame also, when you have a talant like Robert De Niro it could have been more adventures to have a deeper script but still with the element of comedy there. Could have been great. Now it's just passible. Still not as bad as you would expect. (assuming your like me and don't expect that much from these type of movies).",Dirty Grandpa
91,gacsogergely,No sperm in the beer SPOILER!,2,3 February 2016,"I sat in for this knowing it is all rude humor about sex and urinating. You know those have their places, and can be done well. Lot of movies did it in multiply ways, including the American Pie series, Ted, Jackass, Bavis&Butthead, Team America, Meet the Parents and so on.Holy moly, the jokes are even good most of the times. That's why I went watching the movie you know. I don't even blame DeNiro. Why should I? Because this is not ""Godfather""? I don't care. Because he's overplaying 24/7? That was his character's role, his way pushing Efron's character.The way to do well in this suburb is to go over the limit not just by the jokes, but by the visuals. Need a lot of people in it. Need them do obscenity. Outrageous things. On screen. Eat dog-dung filled cakes. Drink beer with sperm. Vomit like a dog for minutes and eat it. Without that this type of humour does not work. It'll become action movie without action, romantic movie without romance.What we get is a very limited number of characters: there's the bride, the groom, grandpa, and 4 random youngster who we are stuck with until the end of the film. There's only 1 sex-scene, between the grandpa who isn't supposed to, as he is supposedly pretending to beat life into Efron (at least I thought so), and one of the random chick from the two (aside the bride). And they aren't even nude. And I don't mean they are under blanket even - no, they do all-American style: in undergarment! I start to wonder: people in the USA evolved into a new race? That's how you look like people?I don't know who to blame. the censors and the company trying to force this movie in the PG-rating? Or it was supposed to become the next Something's Gotta Give (the Jack Nicholson&Diane Keaton movie)?Either way it is a major disaster, also likely the shameful ending for a respected career.",Dirty Grandpa

93,tjgoalie13,So Dumb It's Amazing,3,24 January 2016,"Dirty Grandpa is sad because it should have been better with the cast and premise, but in the end it falls flat of every expectation. Know this isn't just a dumb comedy that is still a funny film, this film is rarely ever funny. Bad Grandpa is racist, so dumb it's amazing, and not very funny. The worst part of this film is seeing the great Robert De Niro, who is one of the all-time greats, in such a terrible film.The script is so bad that it's worth wondering what the screenwriter was going for. One of the biggest problems the film has is it's racist and mean-spirited humor, which is instigated by De Niro's character. On top of that their is no character development, so just about every character is a stereotype or a cliché, the worst of which is Aubrey Plaza's character. It may seem odd to say, but the racism is just the tip of the iceberg with this film.The element that is truly mind boggling is how dumb Dirty Grandpa is, it is so dumb that the screenwriter had to have some kind of a purpose, it's just not clear what that is. There is one character in the film Pam, played by Jason Mantzoukas, who brings the film down like a smelly kid at the playground. Every gag involving the Pam character is just plain stupid, so stupid it can't be taken serious, and drags the film down. It's the flat supporting characters that make the film so dumb, and even condescending because they clearly show that the writers think the audience can't figure out a simple joke.On top of the sheer stupidity, and the racism Dirty Grandpa isn't very funny, maybe except a 13 year old boy who is laughing more because he feels like he shouldn't be watching the film than at the humor of the jokes. De Niro and Efron have little comedic chemistry, and they are the only characters to offer any genuine humor, the supporting characters just bumble around like idiots as the plot less film trucks along. From a story standpoint the film is bad in just about every aspect, except that it's not too hard to follow.When you consider De Niro's comedic talent, showcased in Meet the Parents and Analyze This, and Efron's talent it's a showcase of wasted talent. The film is plot less, racist, dumb, silly, poorly-acted, poorly-paced, clichéd, and filled with flat characters. Dirty Grandpa's biggest problem is most likely that it was lazily made, but watching it, it feels like the filmmakers had to know and went beyond not caring. If you wondering if you should see this in theaters, I wouldn't if I were you.",Dirty Grandpa

Well, to start this section off, I will genuinely say that if you do not appreciate vulgar R-Rated comedies, do not see this movie. On another note, I thought this movie was absolutely hilarious. Dirty Grandpa presents Robert De Niro in a way mostly never seen before. He rips out insults and jokes like he is a freshly turned 21-year-old in a 72- year-old body. Zac presents himself as a very uptight and by-the- book lawyer that has a free-spirited past that he has since lost due to the strictness of his father yet as soon as that uptight side is broken, this film is a wild ride as the two tear apart the beaches of Florida. This movie is purely a joke film, the story is forced in for the sake of film but it still works, kind of.

I am only giving it a six because I am a fan of the great Deniro and the movie has several funny scenes, but the hard core cursing kills it.This movie could be just as funny without all the profanity and from Deniro's role and the disrespect from Zac's role.

The trailer was unfunny and terrible, it just came across as awakward. But in reality it wasn't THAT bad. I'm not saying this film counts as good comedy and i don't think its worth paying out to see, but if you want to switch your brain off and have a few good laughs, well i suggest this over Ride Along 2 because you will have a better time.The first thing about this film is that Zac Efron and Robert DeNiro actually to my surprise work well together. The plot is all over the place and stupid. I mean the main plot involves the two going to Daytona Beach for some reason that is made up, but doesn't become the real reason. Zac Efron is getting married, DeNiro thinks she is too uptight etc. Then the plot gets a load of rubbish shoveled into it to pass the time. But some of it passes as enjoyable, i mean one scene towards the end made me laugh.. and quite hard. Sure i only laughed hard at one scene, but again it was one more than Ride Along 2. As you would expect penises make for most of the humour. When they need something funny, we get something penis related.. i'm human, i laugh at penis jokes.. when they are done right. For the most part they aren't here, but i didn't want to kill myself by the end of the film so i guess it succeeded.In the end, there isn't a huge load to say about this one.

De Niro could have tried to make the impossible true and lead this really conservative plot (hundred times seen student trash movie) with his acting over the edge.

Some of the dialogue is really quite good and made me laugh out loud and some of it is a bit too try hard and almost cringe worthy. Some of the better dialogue reminded me of Superbad. Yes, there are a lot of moments of Zac Efron with his shirt off. But he is in great shape - so fair play to him. He actually comes across as genuinely good fun in this movie and him and De Niro actually strike up a pretty good partnership as they play off of one another and you can sense a genuine affection between them.

105,aquascape,The fall of a titan,3,1 April 2018,"""Dirty Grandpa"" is just another modern attempt at a crude and raunchy humor thrown in a cesspool of R-rated comedies. It's a niche that sells tickets by the ton due to the gigantic stars attached to the films and by making the audience try to let of steam from a hard day's work with vulgarity and crude sexual humor. That's my two cents on the contemporary comedy film and make no mistake, ""Dirty Grandpa"" gets every box ticked from the checklist above.
There are established stars that work out greatly in raunchy comedies and then there are serious actors who do not fit in that environment.The film centers on a young lawyer, player by Zac Efron, who is about to get married it two weeks. Unfortunately, his grandmother passes away leaving his grandfather, Robert De Niro, a war veteran, shattered into pieces. He tries to console his grandfather and is deceived into going on a spring break road trip, hoping to find his youthful self again. 
The script has no quality to it, just another spring break type of story with many disturbing scenes involving De Niro, especially his character's awkward relationship with Aubrey Plaza's character.I idolized Robert De Niro for many decades, from ""Mean Streets"" to ""Casino"", he was the embodiment of the gangster persona. His performances left you chills long after the movie ended. Since the 00's he has been doing mostly light comedies or family friendly movies. 
Now, with seeing the vast majority of De Niro's filmography, I have to say that ""Dirty Grandpa"" is definitely one of the lowest, if not the lowest point of his career. This is not due to his performance, but to the fact that he agreed to take on this role and embarrass the guy that once put raw energy into his characters. The film really left me in an unpleasant mood, a bit shook up on how an idol fell to the common rows.""Dirty Grandpa"" is a childish film that will make you never look the same way again at Robert De Niro. One of the most disappointing cinematic experiences I have ever had!",Dirty Grandpa

108,yourfavoritecritic,De Niro... Why?,2,10 January 2021,"Dirty Grandpa is directed by Dan Mazer, written by John Phillips and stars Zac Efron, Robert De Niro, Aubrey Plaza, and Zoey Deutch, among others. It tells the story of a recently widowed husband forcing his uptight grandson to join him on an adventure to Florida during Spring Break. Despite its poor audience and critical reception, Dirty Grandpa performed quite well during its run in theatres during the early months of 2016.I won't be the first to say that Dirty Grandpa is bad. It's very bad in fact. There is tons wrong with this movie and its apparent right from the jump, the concept of a mismatched duo going on a road trip is a very tired plot, however, the least a movie of this nature can do is be funny and Dirty Grandpa can't even do that. Much of the humour relies on gross-out, raunchy jokes, that sadly do not work and are very played out. I did not need to see Robert De Niro jerking off, saying the n-word nor having sex, there was nothing funny about it other than he is a respected actor and an older gentleman, so ""ha-ha, that must be funny! Old people jerk off too"".If the road trip aspect wasn't enough of a cliché, the writer incorporates a marriage into the equation, with an old connection making their return into a character's life. Basically, Zac Efron's character is about to marry someone who is controlling but during his road trip with Robert De Niro runs into an old student of his and we all know where this plot point leads to even before it begins. It's a very tiresome story that begs the question of why this movie was even green lite in the first place, it features a pretty star-studded cast who can be pretty funny but the end result is just an unfunny, cliché ridden movie. Even Aubrey Plaza and Jason Mantzoukas who have been used in funny ways in other movies are reduced to caricatures who are loud and very one-note. It's extremely disappointing to see the cast wasted in this way, but I have seriously no clue why this was made or even rewritten considering how almost all of the jokes fell flat.Nothing about this movie was that good, it was loud, dumb and one of the most formulaic movies I have seen in quite sometime, however I can't deny that I didn't hate myself while watching it. The story moves at a very fast pace, that the 1 hour and 42-minute runtime did not feel long whatsoever. I was never bored or checked my phone during this movie, so despite it being so crudely made I must admit that I was entertained throughout. This does not mean that I enjoyed the film or can recommend however despite the horribleness this film oozes I'm glad it didn't make me want to peel my eyelids off, I am giving Dirty Grandpa a 2.5/10",Dirty Grandpa
109,dunnypop,Mediocre Rated R raunchy comedy with Robert Deniro,6,22 February 2017,"There has been a rise of adult / rated R comedies which some gems like 21&22 Jump Street, Neighbors 1&2. Dirty Grandpa falls under the less inspired of the raunchy Rated R comedies. The only saving grace (or at least the question you ask yourself throughout the film) is how and why is Robert Deniro in this film? Deniro has been in everything including the Focker movies and Machete so I guess this kind of made sense... have a drug induced, overly sex, non-PC movie. The story itself is pretty much uptight lawyer who's getting married (played by Zach Effron) needs to take his grieving grandpa home and almost immediately his grandpa wants to ""bang"" everything in sight. This leads drugs, sex, and super awkward situations and mixed in with a lot of crude jokes and very crude jokes that hits almost everything from mild racism, homophobia, and plenty of dick jokes.I found the movie amusing enough to finish, it's definitely a forgettable comedy.",Dirty Grandpa

Erratum: it's ""Lose your manhood. Find your way."", not the other way round. At the beginning of the thing, Jason (Zzzzzac Efron) is a preppy heterosexual corporate lawyer goody-two-shoes, engaged to an uptight harpy; by its end, he has become his dissolute grandfather's toy boy, wearing hustler clothes while getting drunk, stone and promiscuous. But considering it's a Springbreak comedy, all will end well for all involved. Obviously, the grandfather's name is Dick and he's played by Robert de Niro, exploring yet uncharted abysses.How much of a closeted homosexual are you? It's the exact measure of how long you can cope with Dirty Grandpa. Being white and a bit of a prick can help, too. Its blatant homo eroticism, nurtured by a constant flow of gay innuendo, is thinly veiled by the clockwork use of the word ""vagina"". It's one of these drinking game movies, see. Springing out of the woodwork, a rabbi suddenly says ""swastika of penises"". Hey, why not?There is no plot to speak of but (butt?) a series of sketches between a puritan jock and his sex-crazed elder. Grandpa has been married and faithful for 40 years so now he just wants to ""f*** f*** f***"". Vaginas. More vaginas. Even more vaginas. The camera rapturously leaps up de Niro's expressing nothing but grinning priapism. Efron vaguely emotes when he stumbles on his grandpa jerking off, inadvertently smokes crack or finds himself forced to participate in a dance off contest (""Cirque du So Gay""), his grandpa calls it. Yep. He's easily over-abbed by a zombi-eyed frat boy.Vaginas, pardon, women characters are non existent, being ""lower half Cuban"" at best. There is of course a funeral, a karaoke and a golf course; come on, golf balls, what do think of, dude? All endless improv, pedophile gags, law for dummies, fart jokes and cheap crooners inadvertently revealing that its demographics is more old men in raincoats than frat boys, Dirty Grandpa is a guilty pleasure for its chosen few and a complete waste of time and brainpower for everybody else.It's endlessly quotable, though.

112,DBlackthorne,A vacuous performance,1,21 November 2016,"A man with the appropriate name of Dick, loses his wife of decades to cancer, to which he immediately embarks upon a mission to copulate at all costs, imposing & disrupting his attorney grandson's life and impending wedding for his own selfish ends, in a vulgar, desperate tirade that leads him to Florida for Spring Break.With exaggerations in personality defects and traits, they meet several unsavory characters along the way, from a ridiculous stoner who runs a gift shop, to two absurd, pandering clownish beach officers who themselves are disrespecting of the law, to a couple of large cretins with attractive wandering girlfriends, one of whom has a senior citizen fetish, taking a liking to Mr. Kelly. Apparently sadly living a life of quiet desperation, probably resenting his wife all the while, only goes to demonstrate that not everyone is capable of monogamy, nor should be forced to, if dispositions do not match. Of course, live life to the fullest, but with elegantly indulgent epicurean delight, no matter what propensities may be, with honesty with oneself as paramount.Eventually, after a series of embarrassing misadventures caused by the obnoxious grandfather, Jason finds his true mate in an albeit attractive hippie-like girl reminiscent of a Dharma & Greg dynamic, while his former fiancée' is revealed to be a superficial manipulator. These characterizations make a point that offspring are not necessarily indicative of progenitors, and vice-versa.I enjoy a good comedy now and then, but this presentation is a gratuitous spectacle produced for simplistic herd of their de- evolutionary antics at a low, peasantly level of humor, devoid of any artistic sensibility of the genre, or real redeeming feature, produced only for mere cheap laughs to separate stupes from their sheckles, since they obviously don't know any better than to accept whatever cud is fed them by disappointing slumming actors, then most likely act idiotically in kind.1/5. 1 point for pulchritude. ∞",Dirty Grandpa
113,morfeus,An undisputed masterpiece,10,24 April 2016,"""Dirty Grandpa"" is essentially a cinematic fraud, which involves selling the audience a generous portion of finest beluga caviar wrapped in a hamburger bun. A rough disguise of a rather tasteless comedy does an amazing job of concealing rich and sophisticated underlying themes which really make the film work. The superb imagery and vivid characters, as well as excellent performances by the cast seal the deal. The movie's main focus is the ever-topical problem of the world perpetually testing our principles and strength of our convictions.The movie begins with Dick Kelly (Robert De Niro) undertaking a spiritual journey to Boca, looking for a metaphorical Fountain of Youth, embodied in non-Plato'ean plain in the form of Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) - a young lady with a healthy sexual appetite. Dick is accompanied by his grandson Jason (Zac Efron), a character fulfilling both the roles of a doppleganger and representation of a lowest point in a man's life cycle. The chemistry between the characters is instant and powerful, forming a homage-in-reverse to the unforgettable exchange between The Man and The Prejudice in ""Un Chien Andalou"". Dick, nearing the end of his path, has no fears or reservations, and thoroughly enjoys being himself, while Jason, despite being still young, is completely repressed and imprisoned by denial of his own nature. The plot proceeds to examine the outcomes of their different life choices and moral implications concerned. The movie's imagery is unbelievably creative and always to the point. A few examples include Dick masturbating to a VHS porn, which is a subtle commentary about dangers of digital centralization and his commitment to privacy and individual freedom. A bee on Jason's penis is yet another nod to Brnuel. Deep and spiritual dialogues between Dick and Lenore are sophisticated to the point of reminding us of Burgess' ""nadsat"". The crown jewel is the final exchange between Dick and Lenore, her begging him for wisdom and guidance for a simpler, more honest way of life, symbolized by Eisenhower era; and Dick's ambiguous destiny, expressed by possible death through orgasm, his last words echoing Kane's ""Rosebud"".The whole cast does an amazing job, but the focal point is casually dominated by De Niro and Plaza, a royal couple of subtle and understated messages. In summation, the movie is well worth the time of any sophisticated viewer anxious for wit and piercing social commentary.",Dirty Grandpa

I went into this movie expecting it to be utter garbage. While it wasn't completely horrible, the film was very frustrating. The best part of the movie was definitely Robert De Niro. Zac Efron was remarkably unfunny and I found him to be extremely annoying. Aubrey Plaza was also very disappointing and she didn't bring much to the film. But for me personally, I found the character played by Jason Mantzoukas to be the most irritating person throughout the movie. His character was stale,repetitive, and every line of dialogue he said fell flat. The plot was nothing special, and it was fairly standard. The same story structure has been done before, and this film did nothing to improve upon it. The biggest detriment to this film is that it goes out of the way to make dirty jokes. I have no problem with dirty jokes, it's just that film is making these dirty jokes just to be raunchy. The jokes have no real set up, and they are essentially vulgar for the sake of being vulgar.

I've got no problems with raunchy. I loved Bad Santa, got some real laughs from Johnny Knoxville's far-funnier Bad Grandpa, but this is just lame, unfunny, derivative, poorly scripted studio slopThe basic premise is: boring uptight young lawyer, a week before his marriage to an obnoxious woman, is forced to go on a road trip with his obnoxious grandfather - sorry, lecherous but oh-so hilarious grandfather. On the way they bump into love-interest girl from the grandson's college days, back when he was an interesting arty photography student.Get where this is going? And it doesn't diverge off track one bit, with 1950s studio formula joined by hangover/bridesmaid/current comedy cliché. But the jokes just fall flat. Note to writers: being crude doesn't automatically make it funny, it's the setup that makes comedy. Simply using the V-word isn't funny unless the context makes it so. Ditto showing a penis - the latest must-have in every me-too American adult (read juvenile) comedy right now.But it just gets worse and worse. We've got the Apatow riffing from two cops, making it up as they go along, going on and on and on in unfunny scenes that are just tedious. The script then disintegrates into inanity, not even bothering to pay lip service to logic. But, hey, Grandpa is really a good guy, because he killed Iraqis or something, so that makes his obnoxious behavior OK?Dumb, lame, juvenile - I'm running out of adjectives, just as this script ran out of credibility after 15 minutes, if indeed there was a script, because there certainly wasn't any new ideas or real laughs.",Dirty Grandpa

I'm sorry to see big star like De Niro smearing his good name in the garbage like this. The film ""Dirty Grandpa"" is simply - moronic. Even that is an insult for jerks because this can watch only critics who must and/or totally deranged people. The last: the scene in which a child bites stuffed animal on Zac Efron's penis is so moronic, disturbed and illegal that deserves immediate ban and jail for the director, producer and screenwriter.

I can understand why some people don't like it but if you enjoy outrageous irreverent humour it's worth a watch. The storyline isn't exceptional but I did think the dialogue was often funny and the supporting cast did a good job at going along with the silly tone of the film.

The ending was so ""straight to video"" level, I can't help but to wonder ""Why can a movie like this get produced into a full lengthed feature film?""Then after, I happened to rewatch an 80's movie ""Who's That Girl"" starring Madonna and suddenly it strucked me: ""Dirty Grandpa is a rip off of Who's That Girl"". At first I didn't want to call it a ""rip off"", I would prefer ""a reference"" or ""a homage"" but Google did not back me up with any evidence connecting the two.So both of them have different stories but the same elements. Both of them are about marriages, the two stories are about a man doing errands before his big day. The difference here is that in Dirty Grandpa, the main character picks up his Grandpa, in Who's That Girl, the main character picks up a mysterious woman. Both the grandpa and the woman have ""crazy"" characters. Both the main character are laywers but want to be something else. Both marriages are canceled in the end of the story. Both main characters get attached to another girl. The Bride in both stories are annoying.If I have to choose wich is better, I would choose Who's that Girl. At lease that movie made me have several rewatches when I was little. Even now I think Who's That Girl is backed up with a more grown up script.So the mystery is solved.

In fact, it should be called ""Dirty Movie"" because just about every character has a filthy mind and the majority of the situations they find themselves in lend themselves to crude sex jokes. Most of the jokes are related to sex so if it's variety you desire in your humour, you will have to see another comedy. I don't mind gutter humour but not at the expense of other forms of comedy. There are similarities with the recently released ""Sisters"" but at least that movie had the sense to include other types of comedy.Jason Kelly (Zac Efron) is an uptight lawyer who is only one week away from marrying controlling and domineering Meredith (Julianne Hough). Jason's grandfather, Richard (Robert De Niro) is at his wife's funeral and asks Jason to be his chaperone to Florida. After debating the issue with his own son and Jason's father, David (Dermot Mulroney), he reluctantly agrees to let Jason drive his father. Little does Jason know that his grandfather has plans to explore and indulge in things he hadn't been able to do while he was married to his wife. Along the way, they meet up with college students Shadia (Zoey Deutch) and Lenore (Aubrey Plaza) who party with them during their spring break.There are moments that provide genuine laughter but the initial impact of the sex jokes wears a bit thin due to their repetition. The biggest embarrassment is seeing an actor the calibre of De Niro hamming it up as the titular character. He was definitely in it for the pay cheque! If it wasn't for him in the movie, this would be reminiscent of one of those teen sex comedies that was rolling off the production line in the 1980s.The script by John M. Philips is juvenile, one that would make you question if it was written by a horny teenager. The shock value of hearing De Niro utter lines like ""I wanna f*^%, f*^%, f*^%, f*^%, f*^%"" dissipates when most of his lines comprise sexual innuendo and puns. Efron is trying to escape from his ""High School Musical"" days but if he wishes to be regarded as a serious actor, he has to make better choices with his roles as he is still the hot bod of the movie.Quite a few of the scenes are unnecessary as they are unfunny and extend the caricature of the characters, especially that of Grandpa's. It's not a totally lost cause however, with several scenes springing to life to entertain the audience. It's just a shame that the story reduces itself to dialogue about sex talk when there could have been other avenues explored.

And how many times must they show Efron's ass? at least if there would have been some nice girls naked (this takes place in spring break after all, right? ) but no , not even that, we get to see Zac Efron's ass a hundred times and one unnecessary dick.. I think that sums it all up.. good night , just don't go to watch this movie , do yourself a favor and don't go..stay home staring at the ceiling if you must,,it will be time better spent",Dirty Grandpa

143,williamzoran,One of the worst films ever,1,28 January 2016,"You know the sad thing is that the main characters were good for the most part and even much of the journey. The dialogue and jokes were painfully bad. I think most of us can laugh out loud at a good dirty joke but whoever wrote this seemed to think that just being dirty automatically meant funny. Had someone gone over the script and rewrote the dialogue without having to change a lot of the plot this film could have been raised several notches. Zac Efron is not really considered as a serious contender in movies so taking whatever gigs he can get while he can is understandable. DiNero on the other hand, what was he thinking? The romance with the nice girl was not actually developed. That was odd, a couple of pics and almost a kiss and no actual relationship development and she is supposed to be the one. Also they went with black and white characters for the baddies. Zoe's friends were dicks to Efron but why could they not have simply been good guys so taken up in their own lingo that as each tried to communicate to the other it just got weirder rather than make the friends jerks. Also why to give Efron an out of his engagement did his fiancé have to have slept with someone else? Why could she not be a decent person who he was not in love with. It cost millions to make films, even cheap one. Getting a professional to look over a script and tighten it up cost thousands so there is really no excuse for this to have even been made.",Dirty Grandpa
144,lukehiggs,This movie has got some seriously bad rating's.,6,8 February 2016,"I went in too this movie open minded or you could even say with with low expectations, to start with I am a massive fan of 90% of Robert De Niro's work and his comedic side does work well for me and since Zac Efron did Bad neighbours I have been a big fan of his comedic talents as well. There isn't much story to the movie and the story that is there is very generic. Yes, some of the jokes are cheap and some of them are over the top but to be honest 80% of the jokes in this movie made me laugh. De Niro is absolutely hilarious and Zac Efron seems to bounce off him giving them a brilliant chemistry.Dirty Grandpa is a lot better than a lot of other comedy's that have come out a lately e.g Daddy's home. I'd say If you like adult comedy's and the red band trailer of this movie appealed to you, You should enjoy it.",Dirty Grandpa

But be aware that this is in the top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. I hadn't had high hopes for this movies. I had gone to see Zach Efron shirtless. But not even Zach Efron strutting around his abs shirtless is worth sitting through the insufferable script of that movie. It was just absolutely disgusting wise-crack overly sexual joke after another. I would suggest bringing some bottles of Pepto Max with you, because the people sitting in front of you will thank you for not vomiting on their heads as you watch the scene where senior citizen Robert De Niro jerks off in front of his grandson and then precedes to clean the semen mess. (I am drinking Pepto as I write this).I would say the worst part of the movie was when they decided to make jokes of Zach Efron being a pedophile, but I guess that would be a biased opinion considering that was about the time I walked out of the theatre.Thankfully, Cineplex refunded me for that garbage.",Dirty Grandpa

150,impalassamuel,"Full of witless, overused eighth-grade pubic humor, Dirty Grandpa was not what I expected it to be.",2,9 November 2016,"Similarly and much more earlier was Johnny Knoxville and friends' Bad Grandpa which featured the same toilet humor, yet with creative practicality. Having watched the aforementioned piece, I was rather bored seeing another movie portraying a recently-widowed grandfather pursuing fulfillment of his newly revived sexuality on a haphazard road trip with his ill-fated grandson. Furthermore, Dirty Grandpa was only able to beckon the first audible chuckle from this viewer after 52 minutes of routine cinematic shenanigans with the second one occurring at 1:21. Also, Zac Efron continues to solidify his on-screen legacy as a foul-mouthed Ken doll college carouser who inevitably winds up shirtless, at best, for the camera. Additionally, this was a blow to Robert De Niro. Sure, he's a living legend, but that credibility does not merit him with invincibility to criticism. This selection was not a complete bust, however. Props to the producers for featuring music from Handsome Boy Modeling School. But unfortunately good music does little to redeem the quality of horrendous cinematics.",Dirty Grandpa
151,bozopauk,Whom was their targeted audience?,3,7 September 2017,"This movie is terrible from the beginning to the end. It fails in direction, script, it is not at all funny. They went for a somewhat of sexual and black humor, which neither really succeeded. It felt like I heard all the jokes and I've seen all of the scenes already, even thou it was the first time watching it. As I've summarized, I don't understand whom they targeted to watch their movie? It can't be the under 16 population due to the type of humor, it can't be serious adults, and I highly doubt any teenager, student or anyone with basic intelligence could like this bunch of scenes. But it doesn't surprise me, modern cinematography created much worse things than this, pop culture is ruining more than just the movies. What surprises me is that Robert De Niro actually starred in this movie. I really admired his work especially as The Godfather is my ultimate #1. But lately his movie choices are quite questionable.To conclude, you probably already know if it is worth watching it. I would definitely suggest not to waste your time, but there always is someone that like the movie no matter how bad it might be. I knew what I was up for before I've started watched it, and I knew what my review will look like. But still, I gave it a shot, part of being bored and part of having lack of good movies to watch, however if you are in the similar situation, don't do as I did, try to catch some other movie or whatever else you can think of.",Dirty Grandpa

I am not a negative reviewer, but after watching this I felt writing what I felt after watching this crap. This is the worst movie of Robert Dinero. I will not give a single star but the option is there so I give 1 star. Will not watch this kind of movies again. I hardly see comedy movies but this was worst of all.

I can laugh at funny sexual jokes, but this was at a level of 5 year old's. Complete waste of money and the actor's and my time... unless the actors actually found it funny, and in that case I must admit I am a bit surprised and disappointed. Besides the large amount of bad jokes, stupid, unfunny characters, an appalling backstory and completely flat non-engaging character developments, the writing is also completely worthless. There is nothing really wrong with the actors performances, maybe even better that one would expect considering the material they had to work with. Maybe they all had a good time making the movie and getting a few laughs at work, but the result was no laughing matter, I am sorry to say.",Dirty Grandpa

I'm far from being a feminist but I found this movie denigrating and embarrassing to all women. When satire fails to be funny, its just crude and vulgar contempt. It was torturous and embarrassing for me to watch a legendary Hollywood icon conscientiously degrade himself in such a way. Was it an insatiable desire for money or an insatiable desire to express his outdated 1960s counter-cultural views that inspired Robert De Niro to lend his namesake to this awful movie? Its a low-point for everyone involved, especially for movie fans.

He was truly someone I believed would've been a next legendary actor, hell, I thought he was the only one from the HSM franchise who would've had an actual place in Hollywood and shed the stigma of teeny bopper that he got from playing Troy Bolton. While he is the only one of the HSM cast to still be relevant, the movies he is taking that makes him relevant is plain crap.After a few great movies, his career took a turn in 2013 where he started acting in absolute GARBAGE. It's like rubbish after rubbish after rubbish.

Now that may be a surprise and even though he plays the cheesiest roles out there I find him great to watch and he is a decent actor, watch him over the years and he could become something really good. But I digress, this film also stars Robert De Niro and it was ultimately the trailer that made this film look a fun watch.Well fun it may have been, but oh dear the film on the whole was appallingly bad! Save for quite a few ""laugh out loud"" moments the storyline was weak, the script shockingly bad and the rest of the cast pretty poor. I was shocked at quite how vulgar this actually was, yes it's pitched as Dirty Grandpa but this was more like Filthy Grandpa and to say the filth was excessive would be an understatement. It's only watchable due to De Niro being the one saying it, otherwise honestly we would have walked out of this one.So, whilst I still like and respect Efron and De Niro this film just isn't worth seeing in any shape or form maybe in the afternoon on ITV2 in a few years' time, but don't waste money on it!",Dirty Grandpa

My god, what an incredible film! I could not believe my eyes-Robert De Niro is in this movie... as the titular Dirty Grandpa! Have you ever wanted to see Robert De Niro waddle onto a set, sigh deeply into the camera and tiredly demand the occupants of the room to ""shake them boobies""? I hope you have two hands to count every time this happens! Have you ever wanted to see Robert De Niro inhale a paint can of Jack Daniels while shouting racial epithets (confusingly) directed towards Zac Efron before he realizes that the cameras are rolling? This is your movie! Have you ever wanted to see Robert De Niro do slapstick comedy? You will struggle to hold it together as Robert De Niro refuses a stunt double, insisting on jumping a suspension bridge by himself on a snowmobile before botching it and toppling over like a wet sock full of batteries. And that is just in the first ten minutes! I got roughly halfway through the film before I fell asleep but when I woke up the remainder I saw was almost a literal repeat of the first 45 minutes, both of which I liked! I now watch this movie every two weeks to more or less repeal my entire nervous system when I run out of Tylenol 3s and I can't convince the local pharmacy to comp me for a ""fifteen week vacation."" If you can buy this movie for less than $30, don't! It deserves more of a commitment from you.

Sure it was over-the-top gross, but it was also very, very funny. The final scene between Aubrey Plaza and DeNiro had me laughing so hard I had tears running down my cheeks. I can't believe all of the god-awful reviews I'm reading for this movie. I have to admit that I love Aubrey Plaza, so watching her interact with DeNiro was a real treat (and consistently funny). Zac Efron was solid as the grandson ... and had to have been an incredibly good sport to put up with all he had to in his role. I say, if you're over 60 and not offended by raunchy humor, give this movie a chance. I thought it was great!",Dirty Grandpa

I don't know what people came to expect from it - this certainly doesn't attempt to be anything else besides that. Maybe many people aren't used to seeing De Niro in such a role, but hey, he's done other silly comedies already. Not all the jokes are that great, but it was good fun nevertheless. So, definitely childish, definitely silly, but also definitely funny in my book. I even ended up feeling for De Niro's character - hey, it's his last stand after all.

Why would such great actor take part in this kind of movie? Is it really that tight in show business these days? Also Zack Efron - actor with looks and talent to dance and sing got to waste his talent in film like this. Recent movies seems that he plays always the same person - hot and self-obsessed dumb party guy. We are Your Friends, Neighbors (1 & 2), Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates - all the same. Also one of main character gets in the crossroads, trip with crazy grandpa makes him doubt his life choices - work, marriage, which is soon to come.

This movie relies on the typical American exclusive sensation, on its dirtiness and dark humour. I'm a person who is able to take a joke and understands dark humour, but this movie is purely dirty, banal and unfunny. Many of the actors are overacting in their characters' dirtiness. It is pretty much a messed up commercial sh*t like Ted 2, except that at least there is not a living teddy bear married to a slutty drug addict (thank God). It's lame how they mix up the banal sentimental moments with the tasteless humour and the totally disgusting dirty moments which are supposed to be entertaining. It's full of movies like this that have banal plots plus random dumb moments filled with massive drug use. Other than that, it's well-shot. At least this we could expect to be nice.

Along the way, the square meets a free spirited (but bland) young woman (with whom he has little chemistry), and she and the unlikely companion make him realize he needs to start living according to his own rules, not society's. Unfortunately, the companion makes him so angry that the square severs ties with him. At the last minute, though, he calls off the wedding, reconciles with the companion, finds the free spirit again, and drives off into the sunset.What I'm saying is that it's clichéd, predictable, and not as ""raunchy"" as advertised (maybe I'm just numb to ""raunchy"" comedy).

Then towards the end they have a bunch of stereotyped black guys come out of nowhere and validate him so he doesn't seem ""so bad"". It was gratuitous. This movie is whiter than The Oscars.There were quite a few funny gags and a couple of pretty boring moments. Half of the movie felt like rob Schneider level characters. Aubrey Plaza is great on TV and while she had a couple of good lines most of the movie didn't fit her type of humor. There was some terrible delivery and the role seemed like a step backwards for her. There's also a moment that's in every single comedy these days where a really drunk naked guy does crazy stuff.

Sure, it's low-brow comedy, but it's very creative & compelling. Lots of next level shiznit in this one. I'm telling you the truth- I really didn't want it to end. Of course I know DeNiro, & love his work, but I didn't know how adept Zac Efron & Aubrey Plaza were at nuanced comedy. Aubrey Plaza's character; a sexy, nutty, amorous type, had me laughing out loud. Her jocular delivery was so deadpan - I honestly think she wanted to have sex with Robery DeNiro haha. Also, you gotta give Zac Efron props; the dude is fearless & will do whatever it takes to make the audience laugh. The other girl, I think the actress's name is Zoey, was hilarious & nuanced as well. Not only is she gorgeous, she holds her own with these three established movie stars. If they made a sequel, I'd be one of the first ones in line. Cheers, mates",Dirty Grandpa

It is childish, puerile and offensive on every level. AND SO DAMN FUNNY. I laughed like a drain all the way through, De Niro is hilarious as the randy old Grandpa, Aubrey Plaza is insanely funny and quite filthy. Poor Zac Efron is a delight as the hapless bridegroom. The beach scene where he is wearing nothing but the cuddly hornet had me crying with laughter. The wedding scene where bridezilla Meredith (Julianne Hough) gets her comeuppance is wonderful. I also loved the two cops with their own very personal take on what constitutes the law and Tan Pam (Jason Mantzoukas) as the local dealer is someone I'd like to know. OK it's not high art, or Cinema with a capital C. But it is really, really funny. I wish they'd had ""Spring Break"" when I was younger.

I wasn't really expecting much but this made Hangover look tame in scope of language and hilarity. As from some of these reviews I can see sarcasm and wit isn't a forte people want to deal with. The societal practice of participation trophies exactly resemble the character Ephron plays in this movie. If your in the mood for non pc absolute insanity, you will love this movie. This movie is what you make of it, a little bit of slapstick, shock value, and self pity for those who need a plastic bubble around them.

189,kmj-16462,Funny movie but predictable story line,5,23 November 2016,"This movie without a doubt has really funny moments but the ending is so predictable. The main characters story line is like every other comedy or romantic comedy ending. Guy is about to get married to a girl, the girl is uptight and controlling. He goes on some adventure and meets some ""hot free spirited strong independent women"". They are just friends but the are so in sync with each other. Guy starts to have feelings for her, feels guilty and is about to tell her that he is about to get married. She finds out some way gets angry tells him ""I never want to see you again"" right before she is going to go on some long term gig far away. Guy goes back to his life but is unhappy. At the last second he tells the girl that he doesn't love her and leaves. Then goes on some hurry up and wait mission to try and get her back. Right as she is leaving to go one her far far away long term (fill in the blank).Some messed up accident happens they talk all is good and then he leaves everything behind to be with her and they live happily ever after the end. Oh and Miss Perfect has a crazy sex crazed best friend that goes for his friend. This is the exact same story line in almost every movie now and this movie was no different. So very disappointing movies need to start coming up with a different story line cause this one is in EVERY movie.

It is a funny road trip story filled with a lot of ""fucks"" and childish (hilarious) jokes which if you like these kind of movies will definitely keep you entertained until the end.

It's beyond my why an actor like Robert DeNiro signs up for stuff like this. In all honesty as much as I like him, I think he was pretty bad in the movie, sort of in-line with it I guess.And what was that scene at the end where the bride couldn't hear the groom and they were relaying the message across the room, it was completely retarded, it would make a 5 year old laugh maybe?I knew it was going to be a raunchy road-trip comedy, but still it was a huge disappointment, don't waste your time and money.",Dirty Grandpa

Zak Efron is the straight man, literally, and works well as a foil for De Niro's wit and timing. If , anything, I'm wondering if there was an even grosser version left in the edit room. Lots of gratuitous drug references that spin the old moral compass around, and a bit of an odd fit, so park your brain for a while and enjoy the ride, it's not a significant film, but it moves along nicely for a running time of almost 2 hrs.

At first just watching I knew it was bad because of the repetitive jokes, the crude humor and naive Zac Efron but I gave it a chance and in the middle of movie it got worse, it just became a bunch of nonsense, it was annoying and stupid. Pass the one hour mark I just hated everything about this movie. Even a dick couldn't save this movie, there's a scene where Zac Efron had to sleep with a naked Robert De Niro. I can believe the makers thought this was gonna be funny it isn't funny at all, why did De Niro even make this film. It's just plain out unbearable to watch with cringe worthy scenes and a plot that gets dumber as it goes on. The worst thing about this movie is that it tried so hard to be funny.

Unfortunately I only found around 30% of the movie funny. The rest was quite forced and some of the scenes like the jail scene was just too long and drawn out and you just feel like fast forwarding cos it was just so silly. One thing that didn't work for me also was how there was a lack of chemistry overall for all the characters. Efron didn't manage to come across as someone you'd empathize with. De Niro was an oddball. The relationship Efron cultivated didn't stand out either. My boyfriend laughed at a few scenes but after this movie he said ""I think I lost some brain cells"". Most of it was slapstick comedy I think. One of those movies you'd watch once and probably never again.",Dirty Grandpa

Something to make you laugh when you watch it together with friends on a Friday night, while having ice cold bear and snacks. Robert De Niro is hilarious. Unfortunately he is the only brilliant part of the film, but he still manages to save it in the end. The movie's is verbally bold and uncompromising which makes it enjoyable. It certainly does not offer any rich cinematic techniques and bring you enlightenment. I mean, did you expect Zack Efron to deliver a memorable performance or the rest of the cast? Take this movie for what it is. It's a tasty snack, thanks to De Niro. It was meant to be that and does not fail to deliver.",Dirty Grandpa

I was keen to watch a couple of the actors; in other films this year such as Zac Efron in Bad Neighbours 2 and together again with Aubrey Plaza in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. i watched both of those stone faced which proves to me the writing really does matter, and i believed that the characters have a life beyond this movie,which to me is always a sign of good writing & acting.

Di Niro's character ""Dick Kelly"" and Zac Efron's character ""Jason Kelly"" seem forced through most of the film, leaving you to wonder if anyone could have possibly pulled off the story line with this sad attempt at writing comedy. The only real shining moments come from the supporting cast mostly being the Drug and Goodtime dealing Pam played by Jason Mantzoukas, and the Daytona Beach police Mo Collins and Henry Zebrowski.

I'm saying this because I've been called hater or without sense of humor because I didn't like it. But, I just don't see what is funny about it. I didn't like trailer and I rejected invite to go see it in the cinema. But few of my good friends told me that it's ""the funniest movie they've seen in a long time"" so I decided to give it a try. Worst spent 45 minutes of my life (yup, I didn't manage to watch it whole). Don't get me wrong, I'm not a nun, but this was awful. Humor based on the exaggerated use of words like f*ck, sh&t, di%k, pu#@y, brings me to the time of first years in high school, when biology teacher said ""pe#is"" and a bunch of teenagers burst into laugh. I wasn't expecting a romantic movie, but also didn't expecting this so called humor based on compilation of swearing and insulting. And Robert De Niro in the role of old man who lost his wife, and the first thing he does is trying to laid a girl who could be his granddaughter (by the age, not blood) - just no. Only reason I gave it 3* is because of the Effron's and De Niro's ability to make the best with what was given to them, which, in this case, wasn't too much.

There were few people watching this particular matinée time and some actually walked out. We found it extremely profane and vulgar. If we could rate it zero, we would. No more movies EVER with Zac Efron or Seth Rogen. We weren't exactly thrilled Regal has raised the price on their Tuesday movie special - $5 tickets rose to $5.10. We don't really mind that but ARE offended by the Tuesday increase of a small popcorn from $2 to $3.30, especially when the theater is making so much money on their popcorn sales already.

All they do is crossing absolutely every single line possible like sexual contact with children, animals and also family members. Further it is absolutely inappropriate and offensive to the LGBT community, Black people, Jewish people, police officers, crime victims, old people, Families and nonetheless even though this is not considered a minority, to white people with a respectable job.All of this while making use of pretty much every swear word existing in the English language. I do not really care about a few F-words throughout a movie but there is literally not a single conversation or character in this movie that does not absolutely overuse this word and many others.The bottom line of the movie is basically that it is cool to do and sell drugs, lie and cheat, drink and break the law, chase after nothing else than the next hook up while using and betraying your loved ones. And to top it off all of these bad choices are going to end with you meeting the love of your life and living happily ever after. Hate to break it to you, but that is not exactly how this works. Thinking about kids or young adults watching this movie and picking up the idea of this being cool or funny is actually making me feel sick and I hope if you have a child a friend or a somewhat normal moral compass you would make sure that neither you or anyone you know would watch this garbage.Many of other reviews here already talked about the disgrace this movie is to the cinematic career of Robert De Niro and he should be ashamed deeply for being part of this movie. I cannot come up with a possible explanation why someone like Mister De Niro would agree working on something like that.In Conclusion it is an absolutely terrible movie that is neither funny nor cool.

If your pretentious then you will never find what your looking for watching this film and I wont waste my breath trying to convince you otherwise. I think Zac Efron is a perfect fit in roles like this he is a good actor and can be very funny. like a younger James Franco.

Something that seemed fairly distinct from most other films coming out recently. This film, however, delivered nothing that hasn't been attempted a hundred times before - ambitious adult jokes, continual usage of toilet humour that wasn't even funny to begin with, and a script that not only degrades the actors, but made me uncomfortable with how abrupt and forced the humour was. Aubrey Plaza, an actor whom I admire greatly from Parks and Recreation, I am sad to say has stooped low enough from her unique character April Ludgate, to portray a character who talks more about human sex organs than she does anything else, to a nauseating extent. Robert De Niro, whom I admire from all of the films he is known for, has likewise adapted a character that presents the viewer with such forced humour that it begs the question of how the film was given the green light in the first place.

229,sindoll666,Vulgar humor that mature audiences can get a kick out of on chemistry alone.,8,13 August 2017,"Dirty Grandpa is in no way a super unique expertly crafted academy award worthy film, if you're going into it with expectations that high because De Niro is in it, put on the brakes this film is *not* for you. If you are sensitive to vulgar, filthy language you're not going to like it one bit. Which I believe is why critics have been incredibly harsh in their reviews of this film. Honestly, most films that end up rated low by a critic I feel completely opposite of after my own viewing. The chemistry between Zac Efron and Robert De Niro makes it worth a watch alone. If you can't handle seeing De Niro curse like a sailor and be insanely inappropriate and different than the types of roles he is most known for, again this film is not for you. I've seen this movie several times and though some of the vulgarity can be somewhat cringe-worthy at times, it's still hilarious. Sometimes when movie dialogue makes you squirm you know you're really feeling the full escape most people are hoping to slip into as a break from the oft too serious real world, and you feel the full on blast of a ridiculous raunchy comedy. For a De Niro you've yet to see on screen behaving like a bawdy horny teenager after being married for some 40-years as Dick Kelly. Zac Efron as Jason Kelly the vanilla, straight laced type, about to jump into a life everyone else has dictated for him as he settles in like an old man who does the same boring thing each day, eats dinner at 4pm and is in bed by 8pm yet is probably still in the prime of his 20s. Fans of Aubrey Plaza rejoice! She's on point as the slutty college gal Lenore, yin to Dr Niro's yang, and equally as foul mouthed and inappropriate. It's a fun film if you're not too prudish have a well deserved, even though somewhat awkward laugh!",Dirty Grandpa

Remember Goodfellas and The Godfather, to name but a few that he had a cool screen presence in. I think he's just making crap movies now just for the money. Remember when he made great movies over the nineties. Its fair to say De Niro has lost it all now after this dreadful film.I used to think Robert De Niro was a true icon of cinema but he really has let his guard down here. Does he really want to be remembered for this movie or other terrible films like Meet The Fockers where he makes a complete idiot of himself and none of it was funny to me just completely embarrassing for the actor to is known to be one of the greats but I'm not so sure I can call him one of my favourite actors now after seeing him in a few flicks over the past 10 years which have been pretty bad.",Dirty Grandpa

I totally recommend it to everybody. I have to say I'm not a huge fan of Zac Efron, but he did good here, I always see him as the High School Musical Star. He is been doing good stuff lately.

There is a boring, boring, boring movie. So sad I have to watch such good actors in such a horrible film. Zac Efron it's probably in one of the worst movies of his biography, and Robert De Niro is ridiculous, not even funny. Absolute a waste of time.

I know De Niro likes to do comedy but unfortunately this isn't one unless you find the word ""Vagina"" repeated endlessly the height of comedy.Basically there is very little plot with a lot of unbelievable and frankly unlike-able characters. It does not know whether it wants to be a comedy or have some deeper meaning but tries to chuck everything at the wall in the hope something may stick. You have to ask how somebody like De-Niro can read a script like this and still agree to do the movie. The smell of poop must have been coming of the pages from day one.Don't waste one hour forty two minutes of your life watching this film.

The other cast was also pretty good, from the guy who sells beach towels for 50 dollars, sunscreen for 10 dollars and METH to the controlling soon too be wife. (See the movie, and you will get the line)Every critic in the media is going to give this 1s and 2s. And that alone is a reason for us ""regular joes"" to realize this is an instant hit.

However, this was one of the grossest, most unfunny movies I have ever seen. Had I not been just killing time, I would have walked out about ten minutes in, when De Niro is caught jerking off by his grandson while watching a porno.

He spends the entire rest of the movie saying ""pussy"" over and over trying to sleep with a college girl which he ultimately does. There is a scene where he and Zac Efron are sleeping together and he places his penis on his grandson's pillow. Then we have Zac Efron smoking crack, full frontal and rear nudity, oh, and being mounted by a dog while he is passed out on the beach.

But it reveal the real connection that is being build between every grand son and grand father. All of the people are easy to criticize the work of famous writer... So easy, when most of those people are not able to handle a pen for more than 10 minutes... For the people like me, that had or still have a chance to have a grand father.

They are having a road trip, and the grandpa's only aim is having sex with a college girl. Yeah, weird. And the whole story is full of obscene words, there are no 5 minutes without someone saying f*ck or something. But all of this could be bearable, if there weren't be the most sick ending.

The dumbest ""girls are hot and crazy, this generation is full of pussies, gays are dumb, haha I punched you in the dick, the war was cool"" type of trash.

Sounds like this could be kind of interesting right? Like perhaps a solid 4/10 film, that would get a few cheap laughs and soon be forgotten about? Wrong.Dirty Grandpa (starring Robert De Nero, just let that sink in) was an unfunny mess of a film, with horrible jokes that could only be possibly viewed as any form of humour by middle-schoolers, and a plot line that made very little sense, with characters who make stupid choices along the way. The ""humour"" in the film pretty much consists of ""jokes"" involving sex, drugs, making fun of a gay person, or blurting out random sexual words together in a form of an insult.

Now about this movie, it was amazing, so fun, entertaining, interesting and a little bit dirty, it's called dirty grandpa for a reason. Two great names like Robert & Zac aced this movie, at first you'll be scared to waste your time watching another boring moving too desperate to make it and using lame phrases as humor but no, not the case in this movie, you'll actually really enjoy it and will finish the movie laughing so hard. People are calling it a down for Robert and that he's wasting his talent while i find his work perfect, it's not easy to pull off a role and make people laugh, i don't know why people think that comedy doesn't make the actor more worthy of our respect, i mean yes he made great movies but even in comedy he's doing an amazing job that you'll enjoy so much. The plot is great, i wouldn't call it a cliché, because there were some good plot twists, and finally if you are thinking about a good movie to enjoy and laugh so hard i recommend you watch dirty grandpa because i think it's gonna be the best comedic movie of the year, every scene has its own humor and basically every sentence that came out of De Niro's mouth was funny. This guy is a genius, and i never forget to mention the hard work of the writers that made these roles and the amazing cast that pulled them off perfectly. Don't over think it, Watch that movie.

253,caseysfacebook,Simply not funny,3,5 February 2016,"I just got home from seeing this film in the theater. No bull crap intro, let's just dive in.I can't help but feel like this movie is a painfully obvious ripoff of ""Bad Grandpa"" starring Johnny Knoxville (2013). A bad/dirty grandpa goes on a road trip with his grandson and the grandpa's antics and behavior get the two into several mishaps. The only major difference is that the grandson in ""Dirty Grandpa"" is in his middle-late 20's and Billy in ""Bad Grandpa"" is 8. I mean honestly, if the difference in the title of the film is one synonymous word and they were released less than three years apart, it has to be a blatant rip- off.The humor of this ""comedy"" revolves solely around making crude jokes. Now don't get me wrong, if done correctly and with moderation, crude humor can be hilarious... But crude humor is both of the legs this movie is trying to stand on. I laughed at the first 5 minutes of Robert De Niro calling his grandson gay slurs and jamming his thumb up Zac Efron's ass, then after 15 minutes I was reduced to weak chuckles. Past the 30 minute mark I just stared at the screen with a blank expression. It's like the humor of this film is directed toward 17 year old movie goers going out for their first R rated movie. The main motivation of De Niro's character and the main plot point of this movie is that his wife died of cancer, and in order to feel young again, he tries to have sex with the first young woman he can. The touching part of this plot is forgotten after the first 10 minutes of the movie, and the film becomes solely the grandpa trying to get laid. There is no deeper motivation behind the character. De Niro did as well as he could with the part that was written for him. I was pleasantly surprised by Efron's performance; he truly is a fairly decent actor. Otherwise, the supporting cast is unremarkable at best. Aubrey Plaza in this movie painfully bad but I can't decide if it was her acting or the character written for her. There is a drug dealer character whose only purpose is to make jokes that he sells drugs. And for God's sake, there is a supporting character in this movie named Brah. No further identity for this guy than Brah.While I think De Niro and Efron did as well as they could with their parts, their characters were too clichéd for me to take seriously. The movie revolves around crude humor where one lead character constantly harasses the other overly serious character. Their personalities are completely different and that causes conflict between them. Gee, never seen that in a movie before. Overall, the movie is a sad excuse of a ""comedy"". Unless you are looking for a simple, thoughtless laugh that doesn't require straining a single fragile brain cell, don't bother wasting money to see this pathetic film.",Dirty Grandpa

If you couldn't tell how this movie was going to go before you watched it, you probably don't know much about movies. The plot was basic, nothing you wouldn't be able to predict happens. All of De Niro's jokes were just him swearing a lot, but there was one character named Pam(Jason Mantzoukas) who was actually pretty funny and very quotable.

Through this trip Jason finally starts to realize that he does not sincerely love his bride to be and has been living a lie. He finally discovers his grandfather is a jingoistic special forces hero to the global oppressed. Dirty Grandpa sabotages a premarital dinner and helps Zack identify his true love, passion for life, and photography. In the end Grandpa makes amends to his bewildered son(Zac's father).

261,kiltedbeachbum,Laugh a minute,10,27 January 2016,"Don't be put off by the really nasty pompous reviews by the self proclaimed critics. The common criticisms by these pretentious arty farty loving pc slaves were that it was offensive, unimaginative and shallow. I don't think it was either of these things unless you are a bit paranoid, a bit ageist, a massive prude and you don't appreciate fun modern street slang. Its called DIRTY GRANDPA! What do these people expect, Billy Shakespeare?My wife and I came home both having laughed all through the film. We loved the cracking rude boy patter that you would probably only hear from an older man with a bit of balls. And who better to play a straight talking old bad boy than the legend De Niro.So, if you like fun light hearted films with some cracking cheeky good lines, you will love it.And so mush as you shouldn't be going looking for arty depth, I actually thought that the film did have some deeper messages, namely anti ageism and ant political correctness.Too many films cast older people in the background, just as we do in life. Perhaps too many of these critics haven't spent much time working with older people to realise that they too like to have a bit fun beyond gardening and bingo. I think the film really tries to mock peoples political correctness, which although well intended, has now sort of lost the plot. The overtly non pc language in the film however is backed this up in a manner which makes it clear there is no malice behind anything said. This is something that an entrenched pc worshiper will find difficult to interpret. To me, the way De Niros character insults but then manages to charm and befriend everyone reminds me of a concept I learned growing up in Glasgow. When you know you can insult each other, without getting overly offended, that is when you know you are true friends. There is one scene where De Niro asks his newly found black gangster buddies ""so the N word, whats with that, can I say it, can I not say it?"" The answer was "" you can say it when we say you can say it""Of course, the pc brigade would say, ""you can never say it"" which funny enough is exactly what the repressed hen pecked character of Zac Efron says.",Dirty Grandpa

In the first 10 minutes we are surprised by De Niro jacking off in his Jason Recliner and we were like ""Oh wow! Here we go!"" Sure the plot is a little thin and the relationship development between Efrons character and the hippie dippy girl would need more in real life, but let's not kid ourselves. We're not going to this movie for a teeth crunching, heart throbbing romance or in depth character driven performances. We're going for laughs and to see Zac shirtless and accidentally high on pot or crack (he's not sure which). And shirtless. And oh my god does that man deliver. I almost had conniptions. Or kittens. Not sure. But afterwards I needed a cigarette.We removed our brains and sat back for the ride and the rest of the cinema goers were laughing their heads off for the majority of the movie. No one walked out. Everyone laughed. Everyone had a good time. Look, there was one scene which was a teensy bit uncomfortable where Zac is near naked on the beach, a little kid wants the only thing covering his nether regions which is a bee toy. And the next 3-4 mins became a little bit ""woah, really? Did you have to go there?"" and even Mr Efron looks like he was wishing he didn't have to be doing that scene. No one really laughed then.But his Horny Grandpa is so laugh out loud funny and outrageous and De Niro played off brilliantly against the equally funny Uni student played by Aubrey Plaza. These two were on fire and looked like they were enjoying every sleazy, delicious minute. Every word they delivered to each other produced roars of laughter from the audience. At one point I was in tears. Of laughter. Not disgust because I wasn't expecting The Deer Hunter. So please go and have a laugh. Because you'll never be bored in this movie....",Dirty Grandpa
263,gbrewer-88913,What is everybody crying about?,7,31 January 2016,"I think everyone knew what type of film this was going to be, so why is everyone acting so surprised with its content? Because of De Niro? Come on, does this man really need to prove himself to anyone after all these years? Isn't there anyone who can see that maybe the guy wants to take it easy in his later life and not be mentally exhausted every day months on end in more in depth mentally challenging and draining roles? Maybe he wants to have a bit of fun! I think this whole bashing De Niro bandwagon is no more than wanna-be 3rd rate film critics jumping on this boring wave. Comments and reviews from numerous review sites and newspapers almost echo the same pc drivel.Yes Dirty Grandpa is filthy, it's got a dark comedic tone and some jokes and references are toeing the line, but is it funny? YES. Did the entire nearly full cinema made up of predominantly 30+ people laugh their heads off? YES. It's not a master piece and it's not going to win any Oscars, but it's a feel good gross out film with a lot of heart.Also the relationship between Zac Efron and De Niro feels natural and works well with undeniably chemistry.All in all it was funnier than expected and I think a lot of people need to pipe, wind and calm down about the 'travesty' that is now De Niro, because it's not true. And I'm not even a die hard fan! Side note: Aubrey Plaza is unstoppable in this film. The sexual intent between her and De Niro is natural, her antics are filthy, her lines are unfiltered and she is hilarious.If you don't find this film funny in any way shape or form, I suggest removing the stick from up your butt, relax and stop acting surprised and devastated.",Dirty Grandpa
264,bconrad-68894,Old guy who loved it,8,4 February 2016,"So while this is a formula movie as I understand them, it was so cleverly done and completely inappropriate that its was completely enjoyable. The vocabulary of foul abusive and socially unacceptable language is more complete than anything that I have experienced. I laughed so hard that I was actually in physical discomfort by the end of the movie. The plot is not really worth mentioning since it was just the vehicle for a continuous barrage of innovative and explicit profanity. DeNiro as the vehicle of this profanity gave it credibility if that were actually possible. Its a pretty big IF but he does have a gift for this sort of irreverence. This movie wants you to step out of the line of sedated idiots waiting to jump off a cliff and take a hard look at the world that we have allowed to happen. If insane entertainment needs any other reason to exist beyond making you happier, that is it. I would probably avoid a crowded theater as you will likely miss too much of the show due to laughter and crowd noise.",Dirty Grandpa
265,ajm-75793,I wouldn't even give it one star if I didn't have to,1,6 February 2016,"This movie was offensive to all: genders, races, religions, sexual orientations, etc. It is not worth the money and I can't believe I actually gave money to this group. I lost so much respect for everyone who is in or made this movie. I cannot believe that Robert De Niro actually took this job. If someone had never seen a Robert De Niro film before this and then saw this, his whole career would be looked at as a joke. To comment on Zac Efron, he kind of sold out. He seems to be trying to stay away from his High School Musical days so much that he is choosing the farthest thing from it. He struggled with addiction and now he is in a movie that is all about what he said was the darkest part of his life. I hope that no one else has to suffer through this horrible movie because it honestly is a waste of time. This is so sad because I really like a lot of the actors within this film.",Dirty Grandpa
266,lmbadgero,Worst Movie Ever,1,6 February 2016,"If I could give this 0 stars I would. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage. It will offend you no matter what gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, etc. you are. I wish I could have my time and money back because it was not worth either in the slightest. I made an account only to review this movie to try to save people from watching it. Horrible acting, horrible writing, and absolutely no plot. I am so disgusted with the whole movie. Whoever wrote it, the actors/actresses who agreed to it, and anyone affiliated with it. I am so upset that I gave these people my money. This is not humorous at all. Please save your time and money and don't see this movie! Don't pay them anymore money!",Dirty Grandpa
267,ramarsh-90498,Viewed The Worse Movie I have ever seen tonight...,1,6 February 2016,"or at least my Top 3 of all time.""Dirty grandpa"" with Bobby De Niro.... I cannot recall in recent memory where I have seen such unbelievably bad writing. If you watch it, you will see from the gitgo how horrific it was.The humor was not even ""stupid funny"" ( which I like). It was just bizarrely stupid.The Movie's attempt at gross humor or crude humor failed at every level.The delivery of the jokes were totally disorganized , the timing and context of them were way off, and it was very forced and just all over the place, like a 12 year old boy going through puberty would write.I cannot believe that De Niro would stake his incredible Rep on a movie like this.A complete train wreck",Dirty Grandpa
268,denises-36108,worst movie ever,1,8 February 2016,This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It was so bad that we ended up leaving 30 min after it started. Thought that since Robert De Niro was in it would be good. WRONG. I can handle the bad language but every time De Niro spoke he said F---- and F---king. Went with my mother-in-law and we couldn't believe how bad it was and there is no plot or story line. De Niro and Efron should be ashamed of making this movie. There is not even one good comment I can type into this review because there were none.I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Very disappointed and was extremely embarrassed.,Dirty Grandpa
269,popsapoodle,So funny!,10,21 February 2016,I have read all the bad reviews about this movie and before I went to watch it I was pretty sceptical about it. However I was in stitches almost the whole film. I can agree that it is not for everyone but personally it was just the kind thing that makes me laugh. I would say that if you like the inbetweeners then it might be something worth trying out.I know that for me it was far far better than I expected in all ways. It is not the best film ever made its not heart warming or beautifully filmed but it is funny and it made me instantly want to leave a review to say that its not as bad as some of the other reviews I've seen.,Dirty Grandpa
270,alfredeinholcz,A very successful comedy,10,23 February 2016,"A very successful comedy, that made me laugh out loud, as I have not laughed in a long film. Robert De Niro and Zac Efron plays flawlessly, you have nothing to reproach them, comical phases are a lot, not the kind of comedy with just a few scenes, but one that hearty laugh, I can say that is worth seeing. But now depends on the type of humor that we each agree, this movie has many moments and perverse aftershocks, people who do not have liked movies like American Pie, do not recommend this film because it is similar. Otherwise the film worth seeing. By far the best comedy seen in the last many, many years! I recommend !! I love De Niro and gives earned the right to play and-not that kind of film that you see it's OK, if not, it's not a loss, but I think it was a lot of fun. So if you want to relax and not beat your head ... deserves.",Dirty Grandpa
271,kialahernandez,Caught Off Guard,8,1 March 2016,"When I heard Dirty Grandpa I thought something similar to Bad Grandpa. I was not prepared for what I was about to witness. Robert De Niro's character was the complete opposite from the work we've seen from him before. He changes from the over protected parent in ""Meet the Parents"" to the wild old man without a filter. To younger viewers this movie might be exactly what they are looking for to get a good laugh.But to the more conservative viewers this movie might be too obscene due to the curse words and lewd remarks De Niro makes throughout the movie .On the other hand I found this movie entertaining,I like that De Niro took a step away from his normal roles and played something more risky. It was a shock but I enjoyed his performance.He perfectly depicted a dirty grandpa.",Dirty Grandpa
272,petaratanasov,From Petar Atanasov,7,2 March 2016,This is really the funniest movie I've ever seen. It literally gave me the chills from the beginning until the very end. And this is not just my opinion the whole cinema was laughing so hard sometimes I couldn't hear the lines so I had to read them. I think the scriptwriter did a fantastic job. The cast was also absolutely amazing. The mix with Zac Efron's talent and Robert De Niro's experience worked out great. They really had chemistry between them. I think everything about this movie worked grade from the title to to very credits. Future project that include Zac Efron will definitely be top material. It also seems that Robert De Niro did not lost his touch when it comes to comedy.,Dirty Grandpa
273,alexttc,I have laughed.,7,12 October 2016,"The film is just superb, It was my type of film, I laughed from start to finish, it was similar to Old School which remains my favorite Comedy film of all timeCongratulations to all the ones making this movie. Really good I hope to see Robert and Zac doing more work in the future. As I said before. This was the funniest movie in a long time.Also people say that this movie is bad for Robert De Niro because of how bad the movie is, but that isn't true at all. This is a pretty good movie and he plays his persona very well. Same goes for Zac Efron. He plays his silly character very good.",Dirty Grandpa
274,beverlyherlihy,funny if your not a prude and can take a joke.,8,16 April 2016,"I like stupid funny. I like Pineapple Express and movies that are offensive and make crazy jokes that insult people. Movies are meant to be different. It's not for everyone which is OK. But if you like offensive humor, you like Pineapple Express or Bad Grandpa or jack ass then you will like this movie. If you don't like those movies then find a documentary or a Emmy award movie because this movie isn't for you.Robert De Niro showed that he could do any type of movie. No job is too small. I liked that he did this movie. I'm not shocked that there are a lot of complaints. These days there are no boundaries of how far is too far when it comes to humor. Its a different age of movies we live in. Those Brady Bunch days are over. Be ready to be laughing over offensive material and to see a new DeNiro. I enjoyed it 😊",Dirty Grandpa
275,troyscrimshaw,A must see comedy,10,22 April 2016,"Sexist, racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, crude, crass and above all hilarious. Guys, this movie is what it is. A wholeheartedly funny road trip with a poignant message. It is in no way cerebral and if you are the kind of person that is easily offended then don't watch it.From start to finish this movie is full of belly laughs, it is as abusive as it possibly could be and still get through the censor system. There are swastikas, dicks, the N word is used, there are references to rape but they are all within context in what will prove to be one of the funniest movies of the year.The haters on here that are giving low scores are obviously missing something or are ardent De Niro fans who are disappointed with his appearance alongside Zac Ephron. This is not The Godfather guys; this is Driving Miss Daisy meets American Pie and the result is almost perfect.I imagine that the cast and crew had as much fun making this film as I did watching it. I suppose it is aimed at an audience of a certain age but if you have an ounce of humour in your body you will enjoy it from start to finish.Some of the characters may appear irrelevant but that only adds to the charm, the crazy drug dealer, the two jocks and the police officers all add a little spark to the movie and are in their own way as funny as the main characters.Although not family friendly and possibly not suitable for under 18s (in my opinion) this movie should appeal to almost anyone who wants an amusing distraction without having to focus on deep plot lines and pretentious scene settings. Have a few beers and watch this with your other half or with your pals, you will not regret it!",Dirty Grandpa
276,stoianalina,my apologies...,10,10 May 2016,"I thought this will be a bad movie... De Niro is awesome as always,he lifted the move like he always does. yeah maybe the scenario is a cliché but is worth watching. I don't thing I ever saw Robert De Niro in a comedy film, especially a comedy like this one.I am pleased with what I saw and recommend this movie if you want to laugh(not to death) but you'll get some laugh now and there for sure. Also the film has some life lessons which is very good beside the comedy and fun. I think this is one of the best movies of Zec Efron.Beside De Niro is completely different.Conclusion:A good movie,worth your time believe me it will.",Dirty Grandpa
277,fabbasi-46910,Just bad.,1,22 May 2016,"This has got to be the worst De Niro film I have ever watched, so De Niro fans beware! I really don't know why great actors can succumb to being part of such rubbish.Well this is supposed to be a comedy so let's get straight to that. Totally crass and crude humour all the way through, with plenty of misdirected and overstated use of the 'F' word thrown in.I couldn't help feeling insulted whilst watching this film because the writer and director must think we are idiots that will find absolutely anything funny.It shocks me that this movie has got a rating of 6! Maybe the writer and director will have the last laugh after all.For those of us that are discerning and look for more substance in what they watch, I would advise you to leave well alone.",Dirty Grandpa
278,parkerabigail-56195,A crock of low level filth to amuse the dumbed down masses...,1,23 May 2016,"Given the fact that Robert De Niro was one of the main characters in this film, I began watching with the misguided impression that this would be a clever and comical movie...offering at least some of the fun humour presented in previous films such as Meet the Fockers, Last Vegas etc.How wrong I was! I can only assume that this film is some sort of punishment for De Niro issued by the parasitic overlords of holly-wood...maybe in response to his involvement in the controversial 'Vaxxed' film. Or, it could just be some kind of inside the industry 'hazing' type of thing...where the actors are forced to take on roles in crappy sub standard movies, to keep their position in the feculant and terminally diseased hierarchical system that is holly-wood.If you want to waste a couple of hours of your valuable time, then pull up a chair, grab a glass of fluoride infused water, and watch it in your yard...whilst you breathe in deep those lovely toxins from the chemtrails filling the sky above your head. This would be the target audience for this piece of low level drivel.Clearly, De Niro and Efron are being the well behaved little puppets that their overlords require...enjoy the pay check boys, you sure earned it by humiliating yourselves in this piece of mind dumbing garbage. I want my money back!",Dirty Grandpa
279,dustinyoung-51615,Can't decide if i like it or not,4,29 May 2016,"Dirty Grandpa had lots of funny parts to it, and you'll laugh many times, but for me it was just a little too far fetched. If you're a high school kid or a dope smoking college kid, you'll probably love this movie. I'm a huge De Niro fan, and I think it was a little difficult seeing him portrayed as an obscene dope smoking, drunk, sex crazed and crude grandpa. I just feel like they could've dialed It back a notch with him. Cursing doesn't offend me at all, but there was just so many F-bombs coming from his mouth that it was just annoying. I was enjoying the movie until it got down to the wedding scene at the end when he's trying to tell his fiancé that he can't marry her, and he's using his cousin to relay the message, and he uses a guy with throat cancer and another one who can't speak to do it. That scene was just silly and unnecessary, and probably should've been redone.",Dirty Grandpa
280,sparklykay,Never laughed so hard at a movie,10,4 June 2016,"I'm going to go out on a limb and assume a lot of the people who gave this poor reviews were expecting a more serious De Niro like his prior roles and this movie is the complete opposite. I almost peed my pants I laughed so hard. The humor is crude and not politically correct but personally, I don't watch comedies for their political correctness, I watch them to laugh. I thought the acting was great too, it was believable to say the least. I'm still kind of perplexed about the awful reviews but to each his own I guess. I would totally recommend this movie if dirty jokes and foul language don't bother you. Don't let the other reviews scare you.",Dirty Grandpa
281,lwshry,Pretty good,8,4 June 2016,"Missed the first half hour of the film as I got hungry and had to nip down to Macy DS for a meal but when I got back my lass easily said what was going on. Easily got back into the script and DE Nero is great? Exactly like my grandpa which is slightly embarrassing!!!!!! He was in the gulf war so he had so many stories and doesn't care either:p get off my right nipple Vikki am lactating!!!!n e ways when they got off the bus and the cop has a phallus on his forehead I chuckled and even my dog noticed how hard I laughed. Great film, one of the few comedy films this last couple of years that made me laugh!!!! Well I've got to make to make 10 lines which I've blatantly done but I think it's wrong that the granpa had a kid at 72!! Obviously the film isn't real but when then the kid is 18 he's 80 and in the school I went to I would of got bullied to bits plus my dad would be dead in a few years... not normal!!",Dirty Grandpa
282,katilax,Why's everybody gotta hate?,10,4 June 2016,"As a white HUMAN I think it's completely narcissistic that so many ""minorities"" are so offended by this film. I think it's completely offensive that the main character, Zach Effron, is portrayed as the usual white male and wears Lacrosse and Polo constantly, when, in reality, hardly any Caucasians can wear this brand and I hate that anyone sees my race as some stuck up, pompous, arrogant child. 'Dirty grandpa' is full of racial and sexist slurs, as well as incorporating a hilarious and occasional age joke. Of course no one notices those because they have been, for so long, considered funny. I wonder if it's because people of age don't care so much about what other people say or think?This movie is freaking hilarious, as soon as you drop your prejudices.",Dirty Grandpa
283,jwsmith-21001,Laughed out loud,8,13 June 2016,"Why do film reviewers expect every movie to be art-house cinema? Seriously. This is a movie, whose sole purpose is to make people laugh at stupid stuff not make them ponder the hidden meanings of life and character development. Robert DeNiro is past the stage of his life where he has to impress anyone. And Zac Efron seems like a good sport to take on a role that makes him go from uptight college boy to regular guy with some total humiliation along the way. Was it tasteless, crude and vulgar? You bet it was! Some of the lines were jaw dropping-ly outrageous...and great! I laughed out loud a couple of times with a mixture of shock and disbelief. I loved it.

This movie is highly inappropriate and hilarious. De Niro is legend and no this movie doesn't change that, if anything, adds to the man's portfolio of amazing talent. If you don't take life too seriously and can laugh at some stupid, yet clever and funny, stuff, give it a watch. Not the biggest Zac fan, but hell, even he played his role great.

If you go into it knowing what to expect, a raunchy, vulgar, non-pc movie then you will enjoy it. I laughed a lot. All the haters need to take a chill pill and enjoy the movie. All of this BS talk about Dinero has hit a new bottom, blah blah blah. It shows his talent being able to break from his usual mold.

All in all a very entertaining movie it has plenty of interesting characters and keeps the laughs going from start to finish. I like De Niro in this kind of role, he was very relaxed and quite believable as the sex mad Octogenarian, I think it would be awesome to have him as your granddad. I also like Zac Efron's character it suits him quite well and although similar to the role he played on ""Bad Neighbours"" think that there was a bit more depth to this character. What can you say about Zoey Deutch, what a stunning creature, so beautiful, so natural. I think she is destined for great things.",Dirty Grandpa

Crude sexual jokes are the only things featured in comedy movies these days. Feels like all the comedies are written by some one who does not ever come out from his distorted world in the village new york city. I do not understand how the sexual joke on the beach with a child is funny for a normal person unless you are a pervert could not tell right from wrong, appropriate from unappropriate. Child molectation is very real and sickening in this country. It is not funny to joke about it like that. How it is funny to use ""lesbian daughter"" in place of the politically incorrect term ""gay""? It is a total time wasting garbage with heckened plot and awful jokes"".

Jason thought his Grandfather was doing it for business, but little did he know he's doing this for a Spring Break. He has not had sex win fifteen years and he wants to ""F*ck* F*ck *F*ck F*ck!"" The whole script was just laughable, and not in a good way. The writing was horrible the acting was horrible (especially from Zac Efron.) Whenever Efron was acting it felt like I was watching High School Musical again. Except this was twice as bad. Deniro was about the only thing that made this movie watchable, and even he could not save this horrible movie! The characters are all unlikable, they either just nonstop cuss or just get high. There's no character development what so ever. There's no reason for us to care about anybody in the film.I don't recommend anyone to watch this film, unless you really love watching people cuss, watching people get high and watching Zac Efron take his shirt off to reveal his ""steriod"" body while Deniro lifts him up in the air! Horrible.",Dirty Grandpa

I can't believe movies like this are still being made- absolutely degrading to women. Movies like this perpetuate violence towards women. College girls are not objects to f*ck. The use of profanity seemed unnecessary to the plot. There are some bad potty-humor movies out there but this one takes the cake. If De Niro hadn't taken this role, I doubt anyone would pay attention enough to watch this movie. Every single character in this movie is shallow and poorly developed.

I thought about giving it 10 as is. It's so funny they could have made it with no-name actors. Instead, they landed the big guns that delivered a great chemistry. I'd love to see the outtakes for this movie. They must have been laughing for months. Is there anything Di Niro can't do? Wickedly inappropriate, immature humor done right. Aubrey Plaza nearly steals the show with her wild raunchy performance. Zac Efron totally committed to using all his assets to make the scenes work (words, face, body). I'm going to watch out for his movies from now on. Zoey Deutch was the gorgeous damsel. Although she did this to perfection, she wasn't given as many of the outrageously inappropriate lines that the others were (to be expected).

I don't care about the crude humor or anything the other people were complaining about because I assumed it would be that sort of movie before I even watched it.I honestly have no idea why anybody rated this more than 1 star but I did not laugh once when watching this movie and I was with friends and we had been drinking even...",Dirty Grandpa
