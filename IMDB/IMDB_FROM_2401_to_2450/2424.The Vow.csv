0,MartinHafer,Sweet but not exactly a romance in the traditional sense.,8,18 December 2013,"While reading up on ""The Vow"", I learned that professional reviewers didn't particularly care for this film. The same can be said for many of the IMDb reviews. While I would disagree, since I really enjoyed the film, I can certainly understand some of the dislike. For folks wanting a traditional romantic film, ""The Vow"" isn't exactly a date movie. A traditional date film has a formula--including a happy ending. And, oddly, the film ends on a hopeful but vague note--disappointing those needing the happy finale.In addition to reading up on the reviews, I also looked into the story of Kimand Krickitt Carpenter--the couple whose real life story inspired this film. I say inspires because so much of the film is fictional and the religious faith of the Carpenters was omitted in ""The Vow"". It's sad, as although you don't want a preachy film, it's odd how in films today there is NO reference to God or almost none and this might have been an interesting addition to the movie.Now on to the film. The story, if you don't know, is about a newly married couple who are in a terrible traffic accident. Leo (Channing Tatum) is okay but his wife, Paige (Rachel McAdams) is left in a coma. Oddly, when she awakens, she has a strange sort of amnesia where the most recent portion of her life is missing. This means she has no idea who her husband is and their time together is, naturally, quite uncomfortable and awkward. At the same time, Paige's no longer existent relationship with her parents is suddenly given a second chance and they work hard to recapture her love and make her the girl she used to be. What will become of poor Leo? The two leads, McAdams and Tatum were quite good in the film and easy to watch. The script rather clever and enjoyable. And, overall I have very little negative to say about the film. Well worth seeing--just be forewarned that although there is a lot of romance in the film, it is not at all traditional or what you might expect from such a movie.",The Vow
1,SnoopyStyle,Watchable standard melodrama,6,1 January 2014,"Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are a happily married couple. On a snowy night, their car gets hit and she loses all memories of her husband. They have a difficult time, and she finds herself fallen back with her overbearing parents. She fits more with her former shallow life, and she can't remember why she abandoned that life.It takes its time to built the drama. The story goes generally as expected. She doesn't remember him. They separate. She discovers herself. They get back together. It's pretty standard fare. The best thing is the two likable leads. I want them to stay together. It's the foundation for this melodrama. They make this watchable.",The Vow
2,claudio_carvalho,Cute and Charming,7,3 November 2012,"In Chicago, Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) have just married and they are in love for each other. In a snowing night, they have a car accident and Paige has a serious head injury and stays in coma. When she awakes, she has partial recollection of her life until five years ago and she does not recognize Leo.Her estranged parents Rita (Jessica Lange) and Bill Thornton (Sam Neill) use the unusual situation to bring Paige back home. Leo decides to woo her again to have his wife back, but her ex-fiancé Jeremy (Scott Speedman) is courting Paige and she does not know why she had broken with him.""The Vow"" is a cute movie based on a true story. The cast is great, with Jessica Lange, Sam Neill and Scott Speedman in supporting roles. The charming Rachel McAdams performs a character that had completely changed her personality from a silly Valley girl dominated by her wealthy parents to a cool artist, but after the accident she returns to her previous behavior; however the role of Leo deserved a better actor. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Para Sempre"" (""Forever"")",The Vow
3,kosmasp,Who'd leave Rachel McAdams,6,29 July 2012,"Seriously: Who would? Even if you know what the story is here, you just know that Channing Tatum would be crazy to leave her. This of course being based on a true story. It does mean that after that incident (or rather accident, that you can feel coming even without knowing about it, but then again, that's the whole selling point of the movie, so even though I don't believe someone might not have heard of the memory loss Rachel's character goes through) we have a very sweet story coming up, where Channing could not be sweeter if tried to, even with one outburst trying to undermine that.The sacrifices he takes are really big and make Rachels character look almost unsympathetic for being so stone cold most of the time. But of course both actors really deliver on the acting front, so that the movie does convince in the end. One of the better romantic movies, that relies mostly on their two good leads.",The Vow
4,jboothmillard,The Vow,4,21 June 2014,"I remember seeing the DVD cover for this film many times in stores, I knew it was a love story film, despite a low rating by critics I was looking forward to watching it because of the two leading stars and an interesting sounding concept. Basically Paige Thornton (Rachel McAdams) and Leo Collins (Channing Tatum) met and fell in, and they married each other, both giving meaningful vows, at the Art Institute of Chicago, but things are about to change when Paige is not wearing a seat belt, their car stops in the middle of a snow covered floor, the car is rammed from behind by a truck, and she smashes through the windscreen. Both of them are rushed to hospital, Leo only suffered a few scratches, but when Paige wakes up she does not recognise Leo, she has suffered severe head injuries and has lost of her memory of the last few years, specifically her time with him, and her parents Bill (Sam Neill) and Rita (Tootsie's Jessica Lange) have only just become aware of the accident and turn up, this is where they meet Leo for the first time also. With her memory loss Paige wants proof from Leo that they are married due to love and not for some benefit, she is confused as to why her parents would not be told by Leo about the accident, why she left law school, why she broke her engagement with previous fiancé Jeremy (Underworld's Scott Speedman), and why she has not been in touch with her family and friends. The parents want to take her home and Paige agrees to do so, but Leo provides her with proof, a happy and romantic sounding voice message, so she agrees to return home with Leo in the hope of regaining the memories she has lost of the last few years, she is welcomed by a party of her friends, but she does not recognise any of them, and overwhelmed she bursts out in anger, they are made to leave. The next day Leo goes out and leaves Paige alone, leaving labelled proof of their marriage for her to view, and after doing so she wanders out to try and jog some more memory, including a visit to her favourite café, but unable to remember the way back or Leo's number she calls her mother to help, she does eventually return to Leo. The parents invite Leo and Paige to dinner, to get to know him more, he does not seem to fit in with the family or friends and insists to trying to help her regain her lost memory, but Paige wants to know why she dropped out of law school and broke up with Jeremy, there is a point when she meets Jeremy one to one and kisses him, and her doctor advises her to fill memory gaps and not be afraid of the past she does not remember. Leo snaps at her one evening as he explains that he wants to help her, Paige's sister Gwen (Jessica McNamee) is getting married soon, so she decides to stay with the parents until after the wedding, but Leo does ask her out on a date, as if they have met each other for the first time, she accepts, they seem to have a good time and they end up spending the evening together. But there is still strain on the relationship, this increases when Paige's father insists to Leo that he should divorce Paige, and Leo later punches Jeremy in the face for speaking lewdly about his wife, following this Paige rejoins law school and Leo does sign the divorce papers, but then Paige finds out from her old friend Diane (Sarah Carter), who is unaware of her amnesia, why the relationship between her parents has faded over the years. Diane had an affair with her father, and apologises to Paige for doing so, this is why she left the family, her mother explains that she forgave her husband for his one mistake, Paige asks Leo why he never told her even though he knew, he says he did not want to drive her away from her parents. Paige in a class starts sketching, and she continues this interest in art, returning to sculpting and painting, Jeremy confesses that he broke up with his girlfriend in the hope of getting back with her, but she turns him down, and then she finds the menu card that she wrote her wedding vows to Leo, Paige is deeply moved and finds Leo at their regular café, they walk together and seem to want to try and become a real couple again, and agree to try new things together as opposed to what they are used to. Also starring The Santa Clause's Wendy Crewson as Dr. Fishman. Tatum did well in Dear John, and this is another film that is good for him to show his sensitive side, and McAdams is a beautiful and a good choice as the woman trying to find reason and settle following the loss of her memories, it is a good idea, the husband trying to woo his wife all over again following amnesia, it is schmaltzy and full of predictable dialogue, and in small moments a little dull as it tries to make the audience sob, but all in all I found it a pleasant enough romantic drama. Okay!",The Vow
5,tavm,The Vow seemed believable enough as a based-on-a-true-story film,9,9 July 2012,"Just watched this based on actual events movie with my mom on a Netflix disc. It has Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams as a young married couple who end up in a car accident with Ms. McAdams losing her memory on recovery. So then Tatum has to deal with that as well as her immediate family who he hadn't met previously. Oh, and what Ms. McAdams does remember happened before she even met Tatum. I'll stop there and just say that what is depicted here seems believable enough that I could imagine it could have happened that way though, of course, some liberties seem to have been taken as the film winds toward the conclusion. Nevertheless, I was with it all the way to the point that I could believe the way the film ended the way it did. So on that point, I recommend The Vow. Oh, and I also liked the way the parents of Ms. McAdams, played by Sam Neill and Jessica Lange, were portrayed. Also, having been a Chicagoian as a kid, I loved the way the Windy City was depicted here especially when seen through subway trains...",The Vow
6,edwagreen,Vow-I Swear that You Will Love It ****,10,9 September 2012,"""The Vow"" is a wonderful movie dealing with rediscovery by 2 people. Happily married and so much in love, this couple, based on a true story, has so much to live for and then fall victim to an automobile accident where his wife came out of a coma but suffered severe memory loss. While she retained many things, she did not remember her husband at all. The film is a story of how he struggles to win back her love.Not only does he have to contend with her disability, he has to contend with her cunning, wealthy parents who had opposed him and see this as an opportunity to get their daughter back.Sam Neill and Jessica Lange are the wealthy parents.This film is definitely a triumph of the human spirit.",The Vow
7,studioAT,McAdams shines in this true life rom-com,5,8 January 2016,"Rachel McAdams is a class act, able to mix Comedy and Drama effortlessly, so this film is good because it allows her to be able to show off both sides.This isn't the best film she's ever made, it falls into too many cliché's but it is an engaging story with a lot of heart behind it.Her chemistry with Channing Tatum is a pleasant surprise and he himself shows that he is able to show much more emotion than I had seen previous.There are lots of 'friend' characters who don't add much but when McAdams and Tatum are in scenes together this becomes better than the run of the mill rom-com.",The Vow
8,jotix100,"Promises, promises",6,24 June 2013,"The tragic accident of a vibrant young woman, at the center of this story, is the basis of ""The Vow"", a dramady which is an account of what really happened to Paige, a sculptor, who sees her life changing in front of her eyes, without a clue as to what her situation was like in the time that preceded the horrible crash in which she practically loses her recent memory.Paige met Leo, the man that fell hard for her. When he asked her to marry him, she accepts immediately, after all, Leo has shown a devotion and love like the one Paige has never experienced in her young life. It is clear both meant to be together for life. The accident changes everything. A layer of Paige's memory is erased from her mind and there is no way to get it back. Leo, who refuses to give up, continues to do everything in his power to get back to normal. Many aspects of Paige's life are unknown to Leo, as she never told him anything about her family. All that comes to a shocking end as Leo meets his wife's wealthy, and influential parents. It is clear she comes from a different world. It is because of her father's manipulation, and the revelation of a horrible secret that Paige decides to get out of her surroundings, understanding, perhaps, Leo had always be true to her.Directed by Michael Sucsy, the film is pleasant to the eye, made better by the presence of two handsome performers, Rachel McAdams, and Chaning Tatum, who make an attractive couple. The director goes for ""cute"", and thanks to the excellent team behind the high gloss production, succeeds in giving it the right look to the film.",The Vow
9,preppy-3,A very good chick flick,7,11 February 2012,"Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) have been happily married for 4 years. Then they're in a car accident. They're both fine but Paige has completely lost her memory of the previous years--including meeting Leo, falling in love and marrying him. Leo is determined to help her regain her memory but her nasty parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) don't like him and want her to live with them and let Leo go.I won't lie--I went to see this to see Tatum's butt shot (which lasts all of 12 seconds). It's worth seeing but so is the movie! It's pretty well-done and I was never bored. The movie never gets too syrupy and doesn't try to force the audience to cry. There are some beautiful shots of Chicago and a good music score. Tatum can't act (everybody knows that) but he still is very good in most of his scenes. McAdams is excellent in her role. Also (even better) is that these two play off each other very well and makes you root for them even more.On the debit side--Neill and Lange are stuck with the evil parents roles and can do little with them. Even worse is Scott Speedman as an ex-fiancé. He looks terrible and doesn't even try to act. The movie moves unsteadily. Scenes start out of nowhere and seem to end before they're finished (I'm assuming there was a lot of prerelease cutting). Still, I liked it and I'm not ashamed to admit that I broke down crying more than once. If you like chick flicks and rom-coms this is for you. I give it a 7.",The Vow
10,zardoz-13,Love Renewed!!!,8,29 May 2014,"""The Vow"" is an ideal chick flick with more than enough sap. The three handkerchief story concerns a young married couple that are struck by a truck during a snowy night in Chicago. The hero and heroine are kissing when the truck driver stomps his brakes and skids headlong like a freight train into the rear of their car. The impact of the crash shoves their car into a utility pole. Leo (Channing Tatum of ""White House Down"") remains in the vehicle because he is strapped in, but Paige (Rachel McAdams of ""The Time Traveler's Wife"") is buckled up. She smashes through the windshield in a shower of safety glass and ends up on the hood. She doesn't recover as quickly as her husband. She has temporary memory loss and doesn't recognize her husband. Leo spends the remainder of ""The Vow"" contending with not only Paige's amnesia but also her possessive parents who want her to do what they believe is best. Paige left law school and moved to Chicago to train at the Art Institute. She meets Leo. She encourages Leo to build a recording studio. No sooner has Paige recovered from the accident than her mother Rita (Jessica Lange of ""King Kong"") and her father Bill (Sam Neill of ""The Hunt for Red October"") move in for the kill. Paige gives Leo a chance, but she is so discombobulated by the experience of meeting their old friends at a surprise Paige party that she goes back to live with her parents. Jeremy (Scott Speedman of ""Underworld"") is Paige' former boyfriend who she left. As Paige recovers her memory, she understands why she left her parents and lost respect for her mother. In a double whammy, Paige's father was cheating with one of her girlfriends and her mother refused to leave him. Leo really has to struggle to win Paige back, and audiences will love the lover-all-over-again romance. Tatum and McAdams make a cute couple.",The Vow
11,Boba_Fett1138,Really doesn't handle its concept too well.,4,14 March 2012,"It's really a shame. This movie seemed to have a good and original concept for a romantic movie but it completely drops the ball.The movie is truly suffering from some poor storytelling. First of all, it really doesn't know how to set its story up properly. Throughout the movie more and more stuff comes to light, which we just have to take for granted but it would had been so much better if the movie had shown some of these things earlier on in the movie already. For instance, apparently the Rachel McAdams character had a problem and falling out with here parents, which we don't learn about until half way through the movie, when it suddenly starts to become an important plot point. Why isn't this ever mentioned or shown earlier on already? It are little things like this that constantly bugged me and completely took me out of the movie. The movie keeps coming up with stuff to simply add to its drama, which does not feel natural at all.I also just don't ever feel the love between its two main characters. Perhaps it would had been a better move to build up more slowly toward its changing point, which now occurs far too early on in the movie already and more time should had been spend on showing the Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams character being truly in love and happy with each other. Instead now its main concept, which involves amnesia, more often works out as something annoying and far from likely, even though this movie is based on a true story apparently. But really, you shouldn't blame the story but more so its storytelling for this all really.And like I said, the two main characters really don't have enough chemistry together. Just when I thought Channing Tatum was starting to get better as an actor, I see him doing some truly horrendous stuff in this movie. This guy simply isn't suitable for romantic movies. He doesn't have enough charisma and he is not very good at showing or handling any emotions. It also really doesn't make him a very likable guy, to watch on screen, for over a 100 minutes. And no matter how hard Rachel McAdams tries at times, the love between them just never comes across as anything true and convincing enough.Also quite odd to suddenly see Sam Neill appear in this. Where has he been all those years? He is a welcome addition to the cast, as is Jessica Lange but their roles are too small to make a real impact on this movie.A movie that really doesn't work out well because it doesn't know how to handle its concept.4/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Vow
12,neil-476,Escapee from the Hallmark Channel,7,24 February 2012,"Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are a young couple, happily married, with everything going for them: he owns a recording studio and she is an up and coming young artist. Then they have a car crash. She suffers some brain damage and, when she regains consciousness, she has no recollection of the last 5 years of her life - including meeting and marrying Leo. Leo, determined that they should regain what they have lost, takes her home and tries to reconnect her to their past, but she is drawn to what she can remember: living at home, going to law school, and engaged to yuppie Jeremy. I will say no more for fear of excessive spoilering, other than to say that there are some surprises on the way, but not many.I don't care very much for Rachel McAdams, I'm afraid. I am sure that screen actors hope that their image on screen gives out something imponderable which draws the viewer in: for me, and despite the fact that she is an able actress, McAdams does the exact opposite. I tried not to let that influence me unduly, and I felt that, for the most part, this film did quite a good job of leading us through the painful experience these two had in dealing with the awkward cards which fate had dealt them. Channing Tatum was sympathetic, and the supporting cast were solid.The slight problem I have with this movie, though (and it is perhaps a case of film snobbery for which I can be fairly criticised) is that this was essentially a Hallmark Channel True-Life Drama Of The Week which had wandered onto the big screen, far away from its spiritual home. Is this a fair criticism to level at it? I don't know.There is nothing wrong with this film, but it never really reeled me in.",The Vow
13,anaconda-40658,Channing and McAdams Vow to Deliver Romance.,7,6 May 2015,"The Vow (2012): Dir: Michael Sucsy / Cast: Channing Tatum, Rachel McAdams, Scott Speedman, Sam Neill, Jessica Lange: Romantic tear jerker that highlights the very commitment promised in marriage, and the fight to obtain it. Effective concept stars Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who are involved in an accident that leaves her in a coma. When she awakens she cannot remember the last five years of her life, including her marriage to Tatum. This becomes a struggle as he attempts to help her remember who she was, all the while spiralling into a predictable formula that often becomes corny. It really tests our intelligence during scenes where she differs from elements in her life that she previously enjoyed, such as the whole tickling bit. Then the film finds forgiveness in an ending that actually works better than not. The film is well directed by Michael Sucsy with terrific locations, but the strength of the film depends largely on its leads. Tatum delivers a strong performance as the owner of a recording studio who must figure out how to make his wife fall in love with him again. McAdams is equally strong as a woman trying to figure herself out. She remembers being a law student yet Tatum attempts to cue her into her transformation towards art. Weak supporting roles featuring Scott Speedman as that ex-boyfriend she was engaged to, and her conniving parents who do little more than meddle and pass judgement. Sam Neill and Jessica Lange are a total over the top embarrassment as the parents. It celebrates two hearts struggling to regain broken pieces. Score: 7 / 10",The Vow
14,phd_travel,A Second little Notebook,9,23 February 2012,For those who have been waiting for another Notebook with the one and only Rachel McAdams then this is it. It doesn't have the grand sweep and great passion of the Notebook but it works in it's own smaller way. The stars are watchable and the story is involving. I can see why it's become a box office success even if there are some formula elements. A wife loses her memory after an accident and her husband has to win her back. It's based on a true story.Rachel is luminous as always. Recently she has been doing some roles that had stories that weren't quite up to par like Morning Glory and The Time Traveller's Wife. But here it is a showcase for her acting and her expressive face. She pulls off a character that could be frustrating with total conviction.Channing Tatum's romantic lead acting has improved from the rather wooden performance in Dear John. In combination with the right directing and some rather simplistic dialog he is quite moving. Rachel and Channing work well together and have chemistry.Supporting cast are good and don't overshadow things. Sam Neill and Jessica Lange as parents and Scott Speedman as the ex fiancé are good in their roles.There are some weaknesses in the slightly clichéd obstacle of the family and ex fiancé but what's a romantic drama without something to overcome.Overall a bit smaller scale than the Notebook but quite moving - well worth a watch.,The Vow
15,gradyharp,"'I vow to love you, and no matter what challenges might carry us apart, we will always find a way back to each other.'",7,10 May 2012,"Romance movies (often times referred to as Chick Flicks) have a tendency to be fodder for Kleenex advertisements: too often these movies are judged by how many times the lachrymal ducts give a stimulus response instead of the nature of the film itself. THE VOW for all intents and purposes seems and sound and looks like a Nicholas Sparks recipe film, but the fact that is NOT by Sparks should alert the audience that there may be more here than expected. Based on a true story, rendered by Stuart Sender and Jason Katims and adapted for the screen by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, knowing that the concept is based on reality helps ground the film. Director Michael Sucsy (Grey Gardens) manages to keep this overly long film centered and allows each of the characters to become developed as people rather than clones.Leo Channing Tatum in his most sensitive role to date) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are a couple who just got married. After an accident, Paige is left unconscious, and when she awakes she doesn't remember Leo. Her physician (Wendy Crewson) reassures her that her memory will likely return if she resumes a normal life. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange), whom she hasn't since she and Leo got together, come and visit her - a rather strange situation since Paige has not had contact with her parents since she left law school (we later find out why the personal motivations) and moved to the city (Chicago) to pursue a career as a sculptor. For some reason Paige remembers her parents and her old friends (including a sister (Jessica McNamee) with whom she broke ties five years ago, ditto an ex- boyfriend (Scott Speedman, remembered for his brilliant performance in 'The 24th Day') she abandoned. Leo and Paige's new family (Joey Klein, Joe Cobden and Shannon Barnett) want to bring her home with them but her parents demand she return to their expensive home to prepare for Paige's sisters wedding to a nice guy (Dillon Casey). She goes with Leo but when she doesn't recognize anything, she goes to her parents. When Paige returns to her parents she is puzzled as to why she left five years ago. Meanwhile Leo tries to win her back by courting her again. Secrets are uncovered and though Paige never regains her memory, her life does indeed change.Though the film does indeed drag a bit at times and could have used a better editor, the actors bring this unusual story to life. No, it is not a great movie, but it is a solid one. Grady Harp",The Vow
16,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Vow,7,7 April 2012,"Inspired by real events, the Vow takes a cold hard look at how we are who we are because we're made up of memories that shape our lives, and if taken away from us, we can almost be someone else, because we're robbed of what we had remembered, and from there the experiences drawn that craft our actions and reactions. Not to mention the opportunity to relive and take a different path in choices presented, although what we cannot have is to rewind the ticking biological clock that continues to surge forward.If five recent years of our lives were to be wiped out and we cannot remember what had transpired, with scant records lying around and even so they don't do squat in jogging our memories, how would we cope, and how would others, especially loved ones or enemies even, cope? There will be frustration as normalcy is slowly eased into a life we never knew, loved ones will be exasperated when we spurn their care and concern because they're strangers to us now, and enemies may find it timely to exact revenge, or take the easy path to reconciliation since we cannot remember what had transpired.This forms the premise for The Vow, which starts off just as the trailer presented, with married couple Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) getting involved in a car accident, and Paige suffering the brunt of the impact because she had her seat belt unbuckled (traffic safety warning so subtly sneaked in). In a comatose state, Paige cannot remember who Leo is after she wakes up, and thus begins the road forward in trying to jolt her back to remembering what would be the best years of their lives in Chicago.A good part of the film transpires in flashbacks to set the movie firmly in the romance genre, showing how the couple met, their courtship, their marriage and lifestyle, with him still involved in a sunset industry with the setting up of a recording studio, and she pursuing the dream of being an artist much to her parent's disdain in wanting her to become a lawyer. Played by Sam Neill and Jessica Lange, Paige parent's see the chance to reclaim their estranged daughter back into the household which Leo fights tooth and nail against, and Lep's story dwells a lot on this contention on which party should be able to provide the best care - the one with money, or the one with love.Complication and challenges come from an ex-fiancé (Scott Speedman) who sees it apt to try and woo back his one time love without much effort since in Paige's mind she's still engaged to him, and not married to Leo, and with Paige's automatic drift toward her graduate school days and her friends then, leaving Leo pretty much in the lurch when he decides to tag along just to make sure she's safe.With the leads having cut their teeth in Nicholas Sparks film adaptations to date with The Notebook and Dear John, both Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum I might add, have what it takes to play lovebird in a romantic film outside of the Sparks series. McAdams nails it playing almost two characters, one spoilt and very much dependent on others, and the other fiercely independent who leads her own life the way she wants to. This causes trouble and pain for Leo, which Tatum to my surprise tackles it quite well, having come from being a dancer to an action star and perhaps now a bona fide romantic lead.Together they share incredible chemistry that makes you root for their coming back together again somehow, especially with Leo's lofty ideals that wooing his wife all over again will be a walk in the park and a piece of cake since she had done it before and will perhaps do it again, but I guess the harsh reality is that it's never that simple to expand effort and not expect something in return, which in this case expectations built by one does prove to be a bummer when the returns aren't exactly what was planned for, especially with the increasing amounts of cold shoulders, being ignored and witnessing someone carry on their lives as if you don't exist.What I thought was interesting in the narrative is how it played out almost like a time travel movie, where we're presented the current timeline, that got interrupted and we go back to a past where the couple hasn't met yet, and then from that point tangent off into an entirely new timeline in itself. Moments become a big deal in the film as the monologue narration makes a huge point about the impact that moments can have, and in some ways it's true to life if you reflect upon what makes you, and how you remember events in specific, memorable snapshots.Released during the Valentine's Day week in the USA and only finding its way to our shores now, The Vow will still pack an emotional punch for couples out there who will likely flock to this like bees to honey, and Kleenex may be the order of the day as well. It's really very standard lovey dovey moments and time spent apart that drives everyone in the film, but just how it played out in the end really served to anchor this with a heavy dose of reality without the need to pander to the general romantic inclinations of how a romantic movie must end. I like possibilities, and The Vow firmly delivered on that promise.",The Vow

I like how Leo, the protagonist, tries to win back Paige's heart, even after she literally forgets him. There is a certain warmth in their journey, that will leave you smiling, if nothing else.Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein, and Jason Katims's Screenplay is nice, but the sub-plot involving Paige's parents, doesn't work & needed to be trimmed. Michael Sucsy's Direction is satisfactory. Cinematography is passable. Editing is decent. Art & Costume Design are well-done.Performance-Wise: Rachel McAdams as Paige & Channing Tatum as Leo lead 'The Vow'. McAdams, an Oscar-Nominee, is nicely restrained in a rather difficult role, while Tatum is excellent as the husband waiting for his wife to love him back. Also, the leads share a warm on-screen chemistry throughout.

The Vow has one great thing going for it; two more than capable actors who have been greeted with a Nicholas Sparks' film once before (Tatum with Dear John and McAdams with the ever-so-cherished Notebook). Much to my surprise, this is not the work of the romantic Sparks, but you can see it so desperately wants to be.The problem with the film is that it is very melodramatic, actory, a tad far-fetched, and somewhat dark and mildly disturbing for a romantic comedy. We are greeted with Paige (McAdams) and Leo (Tatum), a typical married Chicago couple who are greeted with the atypical. On their way home from the movies, a snow-plow rear-ends their car sending Paige flying through the windshield. When Paige regains consciousness, she has no recollection of who Leo is and her memory has been wholly erased up until the time they met.What we are then left to watch is Leo try to regather Paige's memory and ravel it tidy like a ball of yarn that has come undone. Instead of being traumatized and saddened by the fact she has forgotten Leo is her husband, and for that matter the rest of her memories of the last few years, she seems rather content with the selective amnesia and turns into a very oblivious, goofy ditz. The part that makes this romantic comedy shockingly unromantic is the fact that Paige's parents are ecstatic that this car accident has taken place. They have completely disregarded the fact that their daughter was nearly killed in the accident, and are just glad she has no memory of Leo so they can spend more time with her since they never liked him in the first place. I suppose any morally decent parent would be trying their hardest to help their recently unconscious, amnesia-stricken daughter try and regain her memory of her husband, and if not, then why did they allow her to walk down the aisle with him? While McAdams and Tatum are well-suited for their roles, this time, the male character gets the underwritten role, almost like when a sibling gets hurt. Suddenly you are thrown to the side, while the sibling gets more attention because he was injured. Tatum is stuck in the shallow position of being the memory-restorer and not much else. When I say the film is ""actory,"" I mean in a sense the look and placement of the actors sometimes seems more of the prime concern than them actually being intriguing and developed.The Vow was written by three people, two who have worked on subpar rom-coms in recent years and the director of the film, Michael Sucsy, himself. This is another one of those big budget romantic films that tries to be more melodramatic than necessary, and milks the ""snuggle with your significant other"" sub-genre of romanticism. It's not bad, but ordinary, bland, and redundant. It will amuse its target audiences, who probably came for Tatum and not much else, and those seeking cheery, fluffy escapism. That is fine, but so is exploring greater options. That is where the film flounders.Starring: Rachel McAdams, Channing Tatum, Sam Neill, Scott Speedman, Jessica Lange, and Jessica McNamee. Directed by: Michael Sucsy.",The Vow
19,blanbrn,Touching and emotional heartfelt romantic love drama.,7,13 February 2012,"I for one every now and then like to see a good romantic drama with the family and a film like this one ""The Vow"" is one to see. I for one saw it to see the sexy and cute Rachel McAdams she's one of my favorite actresses. And a film like this shows you it's important to love it's a touching emotional drama that brings heartfelt feelings.Set in the windy city of Chicago a young couple Paige(Rachel McAdams) and Leo(Channing Tatum)have just taken a vow to get married only unexpected a tragic car accident happens shattering everything, and that puts Paige in a coma. Only once she awakes sadly and very stunning she suffers from memory loss. Leo is the odd man out as now it's his job to win her heart back, and it's a struggle when Paige can't remember anything except just her parents. And to Leo Paige's parents are like outlaws as they want Leo to have no part of a new life with Paige.Really this film has mixed emotions it's full of sorrow, journey, happiness, drama, uncertainty, and most of it proves love can last and return once again even if it has to start over. And I enjoyed a good eye candy scene of Rachel McAdams sporting a sexy dark colored blue bra! The chemistry is great too this is one love story film to see you will not want to miss.",The Vow
20,KineticSeoul,Trying to get the person you love to fall for you again...,6,20 April 2012,"While seeing the trailer to this movie I was expecting a narrow and cliché romance movie. I was somewhat right and this movie is pretty darn predictable, especially if you see the trailer. But during some scenes it does feel like it's genuinely heartfelt and it's pretty much a good date movie, especially on Valentine's day. The story is based on a true story about a couple that fell for each other but a car accident ruins the relationships because one of them ends up losing parts of her memory and all of when the couple was together. And the other conflicts are family issues especially the parents and ex-boyfriend that gets thrown into the mix. And for the most part these elements work in a coherent manner when it comes to the story. However this might not be a movie that guys can enjoy while watching it by themselves. I ain't a big fan of Channing Tatum and isn't quite sure when it comes to his acting chops but he was believable and likable in this. Just about every character in this when it came to there emotions, it just seemed a bit too forced but Channing seemed to pull off the right amount. Now I can't say this is a great romantic movie but it's a decent one that is good if you watch it as a couple. This movie sort of reminded me of another movie called ""A Moment to Remember"" which is a Korean film and I personally thought was a better movie. Overall this is a decent romance movie that might be worth a view as a couple.6.5/10",The Vow
21,sddavis63,Surprisingly Cold And Emotionless,2,12 November 2012,"For a story that seems tailor-made to be a tug at your heartstrings, tearjerker kind of movie (and it's inspired by an actual story of a woman who loses her memory of her husband after a car crash and falls in love with him all over again, so how could this miss?) it is surprisingly weak in the emotion department. The problems begin with the lack of any discernible chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum (who play Paige and Leo - the fictional couple who go through that nightmare scenario) and it continues with weak acting and a bunch of important characters who are just totally unlikable. The only part of the movie that came across to me as raw with emotion was when Leo slugged Jeremy in the face. I'd have done the same thing under the circumstances. But it made me wonder why this movie had to be populated with such imbecilic characters.Sam Neill as Paige's father and Jessica Lange as her mother are nothing short of manipulative as they try to turn their daughter's horrible accident and memory loss to their own advantage, actively trying to cut Leo out of their daughter's life, and Jeremy (Scott Speedman) is no less manipulative. The downright ugliness of those characters certainly raises up in the viewer a desire for things to work out for Leo and Paige, but they don't make the movie enjoyable. McAdams struck me as lost through most of this - her portrayal of Paige and her situation just not coming across as believable, and Tatum didn't especially impress me either.The basic concept has been seen before. Think ""50 First Dates"" (although this is more serious than that) or ""Regarding Henry"" (although this is less serious than that.) What this should have going for it is the ""inspired by true events"" angle, but frankly that gets done so much now that I don't think anyone takes it all that seriously. I'm glad it worked out for the real life couple whose story did inspire this. I just wish this movie had itself been a bit more inspiring. (2/10)",The Vow
22,Hellmant,This is one of those Hollywood love stories that feels so manufactured and painfully bad that it tends to give all romances a bad name!,2,15 June 2012,"'THE VOW': One Star (Out of Five)This is one of those Hollywood love stories that feels so manufactured and painfully bad that it tends to give all romances a bad name, because these are the ones that do well at the box office for some depressing reason. This one is said to be based on a true story about a married couple involved in a car accident where the wife was injured so badly she received brain trauma which erased all memories of her husband and their entire relationship together. It stars Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum as the couple and was directed by Michael Sucsy, who's only previous directing experience is that of the HBO TV movie 'GREY GARDENS' (which also co-starred Jessica Lange, in this film she plays McAdams' mother). It was written by Marc Silverstein and Abby Kohn (who also co-wrote such popular bad film romances as 'VALENTINE'S DAY' and 'HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU') as well as Jason Katims and Stuart Sender (two TV writers). Like I said the movie is really bad and I like romances (but they have to have some emotion and actual heart).McAdams plays Paige and Tatum plays Leo, a recently married couple who get in a car accident leaving a movie late one snowy night. Paige is hurt the worst, since she had removed her seatbelt at a stop sign to kiss Leo, and goes into a coma. When she comes out she has lost all memories of Leo and only remembers her life before him when she was still engaged to another man (Scott Speedman) and still getting along with her parents (Sam Neil and Jessica Lange). It turns out Paige used to be quite a different person as well, somewhat of a superficial law student rather than the free spirit hippy she had become. This of course causes problems with her believing she was ever in love with Leo and she doesn't understand why her life changed so drastically. Leo does everything he can to try and win Paige back but she wants most to return to her old ways.The movie is a little hard to swallow: it's a little hard to believe that Paige's lifestyle and personality had changed so much in such a short time before the accident that when she loses her memory she's now an entirely different person! Paige is also extremely unlikeable in the film, really cold and unfriendly (after the accident), I couldn't understand why Leo would even want her back! While Leo is way too much of a likable good hearted guy; he's just a little too perfect. I've read that the actual couple found their love again through commitment to their faith and their belief in marriage, they were unhappy that that part of their story was left out of the film. As it is the film seems extremely forced; devoid of any real emotion and the characters and premise just seem so unnatural. The dialogue is horrible and the directing is atrocious; there's so many bad jokes and weak lines in the movie that it was painfully bad at times to watch. Minus a few scenes, like a shared fart scene between the couple, the movie had almost nothing to like about it. I've liked Tatum and McAdams in other films but here they were just bad (it seemed like they were only doing it for the money and had no actual interest in the result of a quality project). The movie is a complete waste and it really is a shame it did so well at the box office because now people will look to this as a prime example of how all Hollywood romances are (and more depressingly should be) produced.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vhN3UBteY",The Vow
23,MLDinTN,Channing Tatum is hot....,6,22 September 2012,"but not that great of an actor in this. He plays, Leo, a man whose wife loses her memories of him, after a car accident. Paige remembers her life before Leo, so he's basically a stranger. The movie is about Leo trying to make his wife fall in love with him again. Obstacles to over come are her old fiancé and Paige's rich parents. It seems Paige had cut ties with them, but now doesn't remember this, so she goes back to live with them. Leo doesn't tell her what went down because he doesn't want to hurt her again. The story is sort of romantic, but the acting not that great.FINAL VERDICT: perfect if you want a chick flick",The Vow

For guests, it means plane tickets, room, board, transportation, gratuity, and a wedding gift.Fortunately, you won't lose vacation days attending the nuptials of the low-rent couple in this romance.Suffering from memory loss after being ejected through her car's windshield, Paige (Rachel McAdams) struggles to adjust to her former bohemian lifestyle with Leo (Channing Tatum), a man claiming to be her husband.Overwhelmed, Paige retreats to her estranged parents (Sam Neill, Jessica Lange). Immersed in the affluent lifestyle, Paige returns to a familiar face (Scott Speedman).Meanwhile, Leo waits for her to recall her reasons for fleeing in the first place.Though it has a capable cast, this true story avoids realism and, instead, becomes a Nicholas Sparks-esque melodrama.Besides, the best thing about your wife losing her memory is that she won't remember that you're divorced.

But it is a rather interesting and entertaining story, albeit not quite the true story it is based on. It's a rather simple premise -- a young couple is in an accident and one of them loses (in this case) her memory. How to adjust to a married life you can't remember at all? This is the first movie in which I've seen Channing Tatum. I thought he seemed ""real"" and not ""acting"". I feel similarly about Rachel McAdams' performance, here. Jessica Lange ""has received six Academy Award nominations, winning two Oscars, twelve Golden Globe nominations, winning five, four Emmy nominations, winning two, three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations...""...so this role -- as McAdams' mother -- must have been disappointing, including only one particularly strong scene. Similarly, Sam Neill's role is not very impressive, but serves the plot.A bit of a soap opera -- albeit somewhat true -- this film is worth a watch.",The Vow
28,Floated2,Hard to sympathize with the character,5,13 July 2017,"The Vow has been praised by many fans of romantic comedy/drama film goers and has received mixed reviews from critics. The film is quite a decent watch but overall what brings it down is the writing and character of the lead Rachel McAdams. They made her character far too unlikable once she had her memory loss. Which made little sense because we see little glances and scenes with how her character was personally before the incident. If she was kind hearted before the incident, how would it change her completely afterwards.Knowing her character, it was difficult rooting for her. And wondering as to why Channing Tatum's character (Leo) put up with her for so long. But that was pointed out within his wedding ""vow"" speech. Of course the film features a predictable ending but not as one would expect. Perhaps many people were expecting Paige (McAdams) to finally wake up one day with a complete remembrance of her memory but that wasn't that case. They make note in the final scene, that six months had passed and they were not together, until she randomly drops by and spots Leo at a local coffee spot.The Vow wasn't as tear jerking as it could have been, especially for a film with such a strong case accident as this. Perhaps Rachel McAdams was miscast, and the film would have fared better with another leading actress. As we did not really care what happened to her character after a certain point.As a rewatch 07/14/19' , and noticing more detail and knowing it was inspired by true events, can appreciate more but overall, the film isn't too interesting and is somewhat predictable.

So every day Leo has to try and woo his wife all over again(like 50 first dates,but like Remember Sunday with Zachary Levi as its a drama NOT a comedy on memory loss). So can Leo ever get back his wife? and will Paige go back to live with her parents played by Sam Neil(who's charcther was a complete douchbag in this movie) and Jessica Lange (who I think was in Hush with Gwen Patrow). Overall yes this movie is clichéd and not that great but hey I enjoyed the performances from Rachel and Channing who had amazing chemistry in this movie and the story to its credit is nice too.

There is one other similarity, but it is near the end and still not quite like the true story. I guess for Hollywood, you have to have villains, which reality had none of in this case. Personally, I think the differences make it a completely different story. However, the real life characters, according to their book, are not as disappointed. For the inaccuracies, I take away 4 stars. Make it more like the book and it is an extremely touching story. 8 stars. I always like Rachel McAdams (except maybe Mean Girls and you were supposed to hate her). In this movie, she was a woman you could root for, but she either didn't, or wasn't allowed to, play the wife's confusion strongly enough. (Maybe time compression was the factor in that.)

But what if one day you could no longer remember any of them? ¨ The Vow is a very predictable romantic chick flick, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. I had a good time with this film and was choked up during some of the emotional scenes as well thanks in great part to the two leads, Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum. You can't go wrong with these actors and the chemistry between them is pretty strong. The Vow won't be considered amongst the best romantic films, it might not be very memorable, but it will provide you with an enjoyable hour and a half escape. McAdams is probably at her best in these types of romantic roles although she has proved herself in different genres. This is not nearly as good or emotional as The Notebook because the story isn't as good, and of course Tatum might be good, but let's face it he's no Ryan Gosling either. This is Michael Sucsy's first feature film after winning a Golden Globe for his direction in the made for television movie, Grey Gardens staring Jessica Lange and Drew Barrymore. The script is pretty predictable and some of the characters are really one dimensional, but there are some emotional lines and funny moments as well. I thought the pacing of the film was also pretty smooth, and I never felt the film drag. I was hooked with the story from the beginning and was actually surprised I ended up enjoying this film. I like romantic films, although usually it has been difficult to come across a really good one. After so many bad romantic films, I guess The Vow will do for me.Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams) are happily married as we see them walk out of a theater together. On their way home they have a car accident and Paige is left unconscious. Leo begins narrating the story of how they met through flashbacks claiming that life is all about moments and how they impact us. He happened to meet Paige at the right time and the two of them clicked from the beginning. It only took him two weeks to win her heart. Paige wakes up from her coma, but has no idea who Leo is. She has lost her recent memory and only remembers her life up to when she was engaged to Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and was studying law school. Paige has a hard time adapting to her life with Leo and decides to move back with her parents (played by Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) with whom she used to be estranged with before the accident and seem delighted to have her back. Leo is crushed because he begins to feel he's losing his wife and decides to try to win her love back, but everything he does seems to fail. It only took him two weeks to win her heart before, but now Paige seems to be a different person because it's probably the wrong moment for them. Paige isn't the simple vegetarian art student he met, but a high class girl who wants to study law. She seems to have gone back in time and forgot an important event in her life that later changed her. Will Leo win her love back? The premise of the story is pretty interesting. At first when I saw the trailer for this movie I thought it was ridiculous. If McAdam's character really loved Tatum it would be simple to regain her love, but the truth is that most of the time we really are impacted by moments and if the impact doesn't occur at the right moment then nothing will really happen. In other words, it might be possible that two people who are meant for each other don't realize it because one of them is hooked with something else, but once the time is right then the impact can have its effect. Paige and Leo found each other at the right moment because she matured into the independent woman she really wanted to be, but when she loses her memory and goes back in time this love isn't easily met because she is hooked with another person and other goals. That is what I found interesting about this film that at first I thought would be ridiculous. Although I don't think any girl would wake up from a comma and complain about being married to Channing Tatum. I don't think it would be a problem with most girls. The Vow is interesting enough and I think most people who like romantic films will enjoy this. For people who really don't like these sort of movies then they will want to stay away from this one because it is sentimental and cheesy at times, but I think love is this way most of the time. I had a pleasant enough experience to enjoy and recommend this movie.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",The Vow

35,RavenGlamDVDCollector,unforgettable performance by Rachel,7,14 September 2015,"First off, slightly disappointed by movie. Expected another IF ONLY (Jennifer Love Hewitt)*, and this it sure ain't. I don't know why, 'cause Rachel gives a fine performance, so it's nothing wrong at her side. But something lacks. I got totally caught up in the aforementioned title, and that one's a weepy, and I can get really emotional too, but this one didn't bring the same reaction.*Okay, that one is something completely different, but this movie was advocated to me by someone who enjoyed IF ONLY as well, both these titles are intensely emotional, they are in the same class.Am amazed by the callousness of some people. Listening to the Director's Commentary, I especially noted that he mentioned that he guarded against Paige sounding bitchy. That it should be clear that her emotional turmoil comes from her uncertainty. But there are actually people out here on the Board Comments who do not understand the severity of Paige's trauma. Hell, guys, her recent memory's wiped out, and now she has to go home with a guy she doesn't remember. Of course she would be edgy. But notice how she keeps apologizing. Clearly still every bit the very nice girl. Like I said, nothing wrong with Rachel's performance. And she's more than darling!Also mentioned on the Director's Commentary is that Rachel has one of the warmest smiles in Hollywood. Genuine. And, yes, the most exhilarating factor about this movie, is Rachel's lovely face, those soulful (blue?) eyes, the pearly-white teeth, but more than the beauty, the radiantly affectionate features. She is huggable to the highest degree, and that's putting it mildly. My favorite scene is that bit where they are at the lake, and when she's uncertain about what's going to be expected of her, because sex is definitely not on the cards yet.One terrible complaint about the DVD: Guys, you whet our appetites with the lovely full-screen menu design, but then the movie hits the screen only in letterbox format, and all that glorious detail in close-up is lost. While wide-screen versions are essential, please give us the added luxury of full-screen as well. Just look at that menu page and see how drab the same scenes appear by comparison. And I'm not just talking about the frolicking-in-the-lake sequence. I am super-hooked on her charming face! From the moment I saw the menu page!Very nice movie. Ultra-nice actress. Good script.

36,EUyeshima,"Relentlessly Old-Fashioned ""Date Movie"" Can't Escape Its Soapy Sensibilities",3,29 June 2012,"If this movie was made in the 1950's and trust me, many of the character sensibilities and melodramatic plot turns feel of that period, then this old-fashioned 2012 romantic drama would be marketed as a ""date movie"", one you would have seen in a drive-in as you try to figure out if you're going to make it to third base with your date. It would have starred Troy Donahue and either Connie Stevens or Suzanne Pleshette with plenty of picture-postcard scenes as they decide should they or shouldn't they. Granted, this film goes well past that question but still ponders the enduring power of love against the odds of amnesia, overbearing parents, a snarky ex-boyfriend, and a bohemian lifestyle that still seems quite comfortable. Credited to no less than three writers - Abby Kohn, Marc Silverstein, and Jason Katims – and directed by Michael Sucsy, the story is based on the true experiences of a devoutly Christian couple who amazingly went through the trials depicted here, and even though the religious element could have brought an intriguing angle to a more audacious filmmaker, it's removed in this version to broaden its audience appeal. It also makes the whole venture feel more manufactured and ultimately generic.Paige and Leo are an attractive pair of kindred artistic soulmates who fall desperately in love. Everything is beyond euphoric for them until a snowstorm forces a truck to skid uncontrollably and sends Paige headlong through their front windshield right after she unbuckles her seatbelt to smooch Leo. Paige later awakens from a coma to see Leo at her bedside and thinks he's her doctor. It turns out the collision has erased the last five years of her memory. She doesn't remember not only meeting and marrying Leo but also leaving law school to become an avant-garde sculptor and vegetarian. We find out she has completely forgotten her estrangement from her status-conscious parents who want to see her reunite with Jeremy, the businessman fiancée she had dumped before even meeting Leo, a struggling music producer. Consequently, she starts to revert back to her earlier self, and it is apparently up to Leo to reignite the chemistry that brought them together in the first place. If the set-up wasn't based on reality, there could have been the makings of an interesting psychological thriller or even a dark comedy, but the whole story is played straight-up for maximum tissue usage.Although I am beginning to appreciate his comic skills elsewhere (""21 Jump Street""), the lunkish Channing Tatum has to work overtime to come across as anything more than this generation's Troy Donahue as the tortured Leo, but the by-the-numbers script, especially his psycho- babble voice-over, works heavily against him. Rachel McAdams showed early promise in ""Mean Girls"", but with few exceptions, her career has lately been a series of romantically hazy heroines caught in soul-searching dilemmas (""The Notebook"", ""The Time Traveler's Wife""). Her Paige whether in before or after modes is no exception to this increasingly tired pattern. The normally likable Scott Speedman is relegated to the cardboard role of resentful suitor as Jeremy, while Sam Neill is all greed and bluster as Paige's father. A surgically altered Jessica Lange barely registers except for one late scene with McAdams that finally moves the plot toward its inevitable resolution. Life-changing accidents have figured prominently for as long as cinema has been around from ""Magnificent Obsession"" to ""While You Were Sleeping"", but previous executions better reflected their times or at least situations that feel more realistic than the true-life story here.",The Vow

Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) are a madly in love married couple that suffer a horrible car crash. Both of their lovely faces are left unharmed, but Paige has lost her memories of the last five years. Looks like it's up to Leo to win her back and prove love can happen a second time. But poor Leo has to put up with Paige's obnoxious parents who are both happy about her memory loss, and with Paige who seems perfectly content in having forgotten a chunk of her life, and who is now in her mind anyways, back with her boyfriend she had five years ago.The writing here is generic bad romantic movie. Not much stands out as being just horrible, but nothing is particularly good either. There's an attempt to make Leo some sort of philosopher or something, so in his narration, and occasionally throughout the film, Tatum gives little ""deep"" lines, like one about a pie maker and his dreams. It comes off as a bit forced, but again, it could be worse. Other than Tatum's inability to give a dramatic monologue, the acting isn't too bad. Sam Neil gives his typical stern man routine as Paige's antagonistic dad, and it sort of works, despite that it makes him out to be a borderline sociopath. The movie isn't bad looking either. It looks sort of flashy, and at times of love making, it's almost filmed like a soap opera, but it's still sort of pretty to look at.Channing Tatum is a likable lead here. He isn't a great actor, and scenes that force him to give teary speeches are almost cringe worthy, but he and McAdams do have a slight chemistry on screen, despite the so-so writing. The characters of Paige and Leo are in love. The only reason for this seems to be that they are attracted to one another. There's zero subtleties to this romance, where either the two of them are hysterically giggling at each other's lame lines, or they're making or about to make love. These two, before the accident, were meant for each other, despite the fact that we have no idea why they are, other than sexual attraction. While Channing Tatum's character of Leo is likable, Rachel McAdam's character of Paige is quite unlikable. She is fully aware that she has gotten in an accident and that five years of her memories are just gone, but she doesn't really care. She doesn't care that she's hurting her husband (whom she doesn't remember, but still...). She doesn't care that she has no remembrance of why things have changed, and worst of all she seems to have become even more superficial and uncaring after her accident. Perhaps the brain damage also made her a dumb, shallow, and uncaring teenager,. Is this how she was shortly before she met Leo? If so, why did he fall for her? It's Paige's lack of any real ambition or care, that makes this chick flick less emotional, and even those going in expecting to cry might be surprised to find that the emotion isn't real enough to allow any shed tears.Basically what we have here is a dumb Valentine's day movie. The story moves along quickly. It's hard to be invested in any of this, because it feels too Hollywood fake to believe it. And yet it's based on a true story. But then again so is the explosive Red Tails, so perhaps that is meaningless. My rating: ** out of ****. 108 mins. PG-13 for sexuality, a car accident and some language.",The Vow

40,pc95,Touching and Whimsical Despite the first 15min,6,5 June 2012,"""The Vow"", directed by Michael Sucsy and starring Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams is a decent drama if you throw away the 1st 15 or 20 min of the film. (Spoilers) This introductory portion is gawd-awful with MTV drowned music-video cuts of our 2 stars kissing and cuddling and looking oh so perfect - ""gee isn't life so swell, and aren't we in bliss"". Unfortunately this is a problem fully the fault on the director, who needs to stop drowning us in music and facial shots and get on with what the movie needs to be about. It almost warranted the movie being turned off. Luckily the director rights the pace and content getting on with the main conflict at about 15 min in and finally sticks to dialog instead of soundrack. So what else? I thought the parents (played well by Sam Neill and Jessica Lange) were caricatures for much of the movie. The way they treated the Tatum character was unbelievable for most of the movie, and really like plot-devices. McAdams helps save the project with her million-dollar smile and presence in scenes - particularly a great mix of rediscovery ones for the middle of the film of her practical and filial self being disgusted with what she found herself to become (ie tattoo, vegan etc) - entertaining to be sure. (spoilers) The muted ending of the film seems well handled too considering their months of time away from one-another; it grounded a lot of the whimsy and over-playfulness from the beginning refreshingly.

The Vow brings two Nicolas Sparks' bankable stars The Notebook's Rachel McAdams and Dear John's Channing Tatum together for the first time. The movie and story is as complicated as any Nicolas Spark's novel can be, so the comparison is obvious. I have to say that the whole movie rests upon Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams amazing chemistry and performance. Rachel McAdams looked breathtakingly gorgeous in the movie and every time she smiles she lightens the screen. Channing Tatum give wooden performances in most of his action movie but just like Dear John, he impresses yet again. Jessica Lange and Sam Neill are veterans. Scott Speedman is great with his evil grin. The Vow has good looking supporting cast Dillon Casey, Lucas Bryant, Shannon Barnett, Jessica McNamee and Jeananne Goosman.

43,blott2319-1,"Sappy as can be, but lacks a little something magical",6,31 August 2020,"I have a strong tolerance for sappy romance movies. People wouldn't guess it looking at me, but I'm a big softy, and I wanted to love The Vow. It's such a fascinating premise, as we see two lovers who are torn apart because of a serious brain injury that leads to massive memory loss. Essentially it is a more dramatic version of While You Were Sleeping, and I love that film. The fact that they loosely based the story on two real people was also a nice touch, because it takes away that sense of doubt we all get whenever ""amnesia"" crops up in a movie. There's definitely a lot of emotion in the story, and moments when it feels like I should be crying from sorrow or from joy. Yet somehow the movie was constantly missing that mark. I came close a couple times, but it didn't pack a good punch to send me over the edge. That being said, I was still impacted by this story. There are a lot of little things you don't think about when it comes to this kind of situation that they address in interesting ways, and I liked getting into the characters' heads as the movie went on.Rachel McAdams is the best thing The Vow has to offer, because she is truly an amazing actress. She nails this character, and manages to make a convincing performance, when the premise seems so far-fetched. She literally has to play the same character in 2 separate ways, and convince us that they are the same person deep down. The biggest problem I had with this film was Channing Tatum. The role seemed to be a bit out of his league, therefore many of the emotional moments fell flat. He isn't a terrible actor, but he doesn't have the kind of charisma they want to give this character. There are several times he tries to throw away a witty one-liner, and it falls flat (in fact, once McAdams has to say the words ""That's funny"" to let the audience know he made a joke.) There are also some heavily cliched moments in The Vow and subplots that aren't resolved in a satisfying way. I wanted to love The Vow, and there were elements I appreciated. If this were on Lifetime or Hallmark Channel I would commend them for finally making a decent movie, but as a big theatrical film it left me wanting more.",The Vow
44,jon.h.ochiai,"Letting go in ""The Vow""",8,20 February 2012,"In his recording studio in ""The Vow"" solemn Channing Tatum as Leo plays his guitar as meditation. In tearful epiphany he says, ""She doesn't love me..."" Paige, who is the love of Leo's life, has no memory of him or her past life with him following their traumatic car accident. ""The Vow"" is based on the true story of a couple where the wife lost her memory following a debilitating car accident. Today they are living happily and remarried with a wonderful family. This distinguishes Jason Katims and Marc Silverstein's screenplay. Otherwise, ""The Vow"" is formulaic and predictable in good way given the premise. Channing Tatum is authentically convincing faring much better than Rachel McAdams, who plays Paige. This may have more to do with narrative trappings. What ultimately lands in ""The Vow"" is their touching tangible chemistry. Director Michael Sucsy has the good sense to leverage this, and get out the way. The character reveal for McAdam's Paige is out of left field, though must be authentic given the source material.Tatum and McAdams are a stunningly beautiful screen couple, who are so in love. The signature moment occurs as they exchange Wedding Vows. Leo promises never to forget ""this once in a lifetime love."" Later on Tatum as Leo asks memoryless Paige if she would go out on a date with him, ""I need to make my wife fall in love with me all over again."" ""The Vow"" is hokey and at times clumsy. But they got me—I was all in. I am a fan of McAdams and Tatum. Rachel McAdams as Paige is an enigmatic quandary. She is afforded moments of her distinct radiance as when Leo passionately praises what he thinks is her art show sculpture piece, but rather literally junk. She smiles, ""You really love me!"" For the women fans out there, shredded and naked Tatum shocks Paige as he walks into the kitchen. McAdams does a classic double take—after all it's Channing Tatum.Channing Tatum is definitely shoring up People Magazine's Sexiest Man Alive 2012. Tatum is also evolving as a strong romantic lead. With his physical presence and humbled easy charm, he is demonstrating he can play more than action heroes. Tatum always has a believable vulnerability and that works in ""The Vow"" and with McAdams. His innate screen physicality comes to plays as he decks Paige's ex-fiancé Jeremy played with duplicitous zeal by Scott Speed man. We all want to see that.So in ""The Vow"", following a horrendous car accident where Paige's head shatters through the car windshield, she displays a form of amnesia. Leo recovers from his injuries. However, Paige suffers brain swelling and is induced into coma for recovery. When she awakes she thinks Leo is her Doctor. Leo is devastated. Apparently, Paige has no memory of the past 4 years—including her marriage to Leo. Her estranged parents, wealthy attorney Bill Thornton (rigidly unforgiving Sam Neil) and his wife Rita (surprising Jessica Lange); swoop in to care for their prodigal daughter. Here is the bizarre twist. Leo's Paige was the vegetarian wild child free spirit sculptor. Paige wakes up as the conservative preppy debutante, who was in law school and engaged to vain and arrogant Jeremy (Speedman). Gathering this is based on true events, does Paige's polarized persona indicate past clinical trauma? Again, I have been watching way too much Dr. Drew.However, Paige's past confessions to Leo may allow us to determine cause. Paige eventually uncovers the toxic family secret from the past that poisons the present. Sam Neill is a little too transparent and unsympathetic as Paige's protective Father. Surprisingly, Jessica Lange lacks the emotional gravitas as her Mother for requisite catharsis. Here McAdams is poignant as the young woman rediscovering her power to recreate herself by forgiving and releasing the hold of the past. It takes some patience, but Director Sucsy gently resolves the world. The power of love is in freedom, not possession. There is the touching moment in the end as Paige and Leo meet anew. The future is now a blank slate full of possibility. Tatum and McAdams make us pull for wonderful beginnings and falling in love in ""The Vow"".",The Vow

Add to this Leo showing up in the hospital with a tea shirt cut like, and in the color of scrubs to look like a doctor.The story about what turned Paige into a rebel complete with tattoo seemed forced.

Paige, on the other hand is really confused as to why she abandoned her whole life & decided to marry Leo.

47,MihaiSorinToma,A great idea which didn't end up as good as it could,5,16 August 2017,"A married couple suffer a horrible car accident from which she ends up with a serious case of amnesia, not being able to remember anything from the past few years.

Thus, he is forced to win her heart once again before her family (which have a huge advantage in her loss memory) is able to get rid of him. She will prove to be very stubborn and hard to convince but he is determined to do whatever he can to win back what he once had.Although it is a very good idea which should be able to bring a lot of drama, love and tension, it actually shows how not to make a movie of its type. It is filled with plot holes, awkward events and head scratching decisions. Her character is determined to avoid every bit of logic and act strictly linear, regardless of his honest efforts of convincing her of the truth. If you manage to forget about the fact that the main intrigue of the film is caused by a ridiculous and highly implausible accident, you'll soon find out that the movie has a tendency of basing its main events on basic coincidences, thus resulting in huge alterations of the plot. To make matters even worse, its finale is inconclusive, to say the least, which is simply unacceptable in such a movie.It has a good idea and a couple of very good actors which have played similar roles with success in their career so there isn't much excuse for what this movie turned out to be.

Jessica Lange and Sam Neill, as the rich parents who don't understand Tatum's ""lowly"" lifestyle as a dreaming recording studio owner, nor their daughters choice to sculpt over law school, add as little to the storyline – which almost tenses up once she rekindles the spark with her snarky ex fiancé.But this, like everything else, thanks (but no thanks) to a dull script and wooden performances, amounts to very little in a flick that even chicks might forget once the end credits roll.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks",The Vow

52,Ramascreen,Sweet and Wonderful,8,13 February 2012,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --Two of the most good looking people on the planet in a romantic drama, that's Hollywood's usual way of celebrating Valentine's Day and you'd be a sucker if you don't fall for it because it doesn't get more sweet and more wonderful than THE VOW. Both Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams are Nicholas Sparks school graduates, having worked on Dear John and ladies' favorite, The Notebook, respectively, so this area of storytelling is nothing new to them. Sure they may be riding on the waves of their popularity and good looks but they sure know what they're doing.. Obviously, the plot is very thin, and it's said to be based on true events, whenever a film says something like that, it could mean a compilation of similar true stories or they'd take one true story that stands out and alter it to their own liking but either case, THE VOW does its job. And if some of you may have concerns that this could turn into Memento or 50 First Dates, nothing against those two movies, but THE VOW doesn't require post-it notes or polaroids and the memory doesn't get erased every time the woman wakes up every single morning either.I think the verdict is still out when it comes to whether or not you'd consider Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams talented actors. I think in THE VOW, Tatum busts out his usual good-hearted, honest character who wants other's happiness before his own, at least this time his character doesn't have some sort of military background, so in a way, Leo is something new. At times, McAdams' character, Paige, can come across as the bad guy in the story because it makes you the audience feel like Leo is the one being disadvantaged, but McAdams manages to create a reason for you to want to put yourself in her shoes. The chemistry of Tatum-McAdams is electric and genuine in my book, they play off each other really well. Jessica Lange and Sam Neill gave just as strong performances in supporting roles. I think they could've chosen a better philosophical lesson than Leo's narration about his theories of moments of impact, but other than that, I don't have much complaint. I'm surprised to find that there are more than 3 names in the screen writing credit, I wonder how many drafts and rewrites that had to be done until the studio gave it a go.What I enjoyed about the film is mostly Paige's struggle. Yes, it's heartbreaking to see Leo fighting for the woman he loves, trying to make his wife fall in love with him all over again, it makes for a big adorable aww. But Paige's struggle is the one most interesting because her memory loss has put her in a position to see what her life could've been if she'd made a different choice, all of a sudden certain opportunities open up, and that makes Leo's job of getting her back all the more difficult. There's a tug of war with her family and her ex and then certain secrets resurface. Some may argue that THE VOW is just an excuse for Hollywood to have something opening on the weekend of Valentine's Day 2012, well, be that as it may, I think the story's ability to make you hope and believe in the possibility and second chances even though all signs are pointing at the other direction, is the every essence that makes THE VOW the perfect Valentine movie.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",The Vow

58,ghost_dog86,"If you have seen the trailer, then you have seen the movie.",3,15 February 2012,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. AshlandI swear, the only purpose of films like ""The Vow"" are to make the rest of us guys look bad. Directed in ample fashion by Michael Sucsy (Grey Gardens) , but written by a trio of ""B"" rate romantic comedy writers, including Abby Kohn (Valentine's Day), Marc Silverstein (He's Just Not That Into You) and Jason Katims, ""The Vow"" works not on the theory that ""love conquers all"", but on the lesser addressed notion of: good guys always finish last, but if they stay loyal (like dogs) they will eventually get the girl they want. The ""The Vow"", if you don't know by now, is about this fairly annoying couple (played by Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum). You know the type. The far too quirky couple who continuously acts as if they are perpetually in their honeymoon phase, in public. Anyways, this couple, who has been married for four years, is in a car crash where the wife, Paige, loses her memory. Well, she doesn't lose her memory entirely; just (conveniently) the memories that include her life with her husband, Leo. So, if Leo really loves Paige, he must work to make her fall in love with him all over again. I don't want to scoff at or downplay this lame premise too much because it is based on a true story, but COME ON! This sounds like a Nicholas Sparks story on steroids. And in fact if you are a fan of the lesser Nicolas Sparks film adaptations (The Last Song, Dear John), ""The Vow"" might be right up your alley. BUT still, there are some major issues here that may work to disappoint even the most fierce sappy-romantic film addicts. Because truth be told, the premise of ""The Vow"" is exponentially more interesting than anything the movie has to offer. Writing for men: Many instances in Hollywood films, there are writers that produce screenplays that contain poorly written female characters. In these cases, the woman will be more of a prop than an actual fully developed person. She will be a supporting, stand by your man, subservient character, whose sole purpose is to get the man where he needs to go. With ""The Vow"" just the opposite holds true. The film seems as if it were written by writers who don't know how to write for men. While the female cast is given characters that are more vibrant and have lively back-stories, Tatum is given a character that has little substance (if any at all) and can be only described only as ""nice guy husband"". This makes the Leo character so unrealistic, that his sweet gestures, which are meant to seem romantic, come off as phony. Furthermore, his character is so one dimensional and effeminate on many occasions (not to say guys can't be effeminate), that even the section of audience that bought a ticket just to see Tatum get the girl, will find his character tedious and undesirable at times.Final Thought: At the end of the day, this movie is what it is. If you are expecting romantic greatness then you've come to the wrong place, because most of ""The Vow"" is very love story paint-by-numbers. But if you are looking for a fluff-piece to get you though Valentine's Day, because your significant other forgot to plan a nice dinner, then ""The Vow"" may be what you are looking for. In a nutshell, the main reason why ""The Vow"" is a subpar romantic movie is simpler than just ""the acting was bad"" or ""the dialogue was poorly written"". In a nutshell, ""The Vow"" doesn't work simply because not for one minute was I invested in any of the characters on-screen.

59,Bruce722,Mediocre chick-flick.,5,13 August 2012,"This movie was essentially like a mediocre version of a Nicholas Sparks book-to-film movie. The acting was great but the execution just wasn't there. Rachel McAdams' character seemed pretty stupid and, given that it's a true story, it just makes it seem even more dumb. There have got to be 1000 such stories with ""smarter"" people involved or better endings. The fact that this movie was based on one with a moronic character and a mediocre ending shows just how masochist viewers are. The movie is slow, not emotional enough given the subject matter, and just in general not all that good. The only emotional part of the movie was the scene with Paige (McAdams' character) interacting with her mom near the end of the movie. For a film about a girl who loses her memory and therefore the memory of the love of her life, this movie was pretty blah. The movie wasn't terrible but it definitely doesn't reach the elite chick-flick level.",The Vow
60,gk303007,What to say,6,8 March 2020,"Maybe if i would have been watching a movie like this first time, this would definitely have superseded my expectations and 9 star would be not away. But, this one felt like trying to make you emotional and get judgemental as to think what is right or wrong or can that happen? Again, there are movies many based on more or less same concept both in hollywood and other cinemas and i felt director should have done more. I mean maybe there could have been a better outcome. Characters acting seemed stony, story just moved and in between i looked at my watch to figure out how much is it remaining. I mean, yaa, the outcome is known but the portrayal of both screenplay and character acting and emotions coming out from it makes you stick with the movie. So much so that when it ends you should feel like yup, thats what made me feel good or i want to look back that scene or scenes again; not that oh its done, comeon lets head back to our work.One time watch, not more.",The Vow
61,troy-manatunga,A movie with heart but the director fails in capturing it all.,6,4 May 2012,"Channing Tatum is on a roll; it is absolutely 2 for 2 for him with his 2012 releases as of date. 21 Jump Street while is the undefeated of the 2 in my opinion, THE VOW; a movie of romance tags along close behind. With 2 more productions due for release in 2012 Tatum could well be on the same track as Ryan Gosling was in 2011. Tatum plays Leo a small time recording studio owner. Fans of Tatum would see he settles in comfortably since he is quite commonly seen playing such characters in romance productions. Whilst Tatum's delivery of Leo felt sincere and extending to the viewer the same cannot be said with Rachel McAdams. McAdams is clearly in the shadows of Tatum's awesomeness. This lack of prominence in McAdams is significant to the extent that she along with her poor onset performance drags down THE VOW below the screenplays true potential.THE VOW which is a story by Stuart Sender (his debut) and a screenplay by Jason Katims (Emmy award winning writer), Abby Kohn (Valentine's Day) and Marc Silverstien (He is just not that into you) in my opinion is as promising as MIDNIGHT IN Paris done by Woody Allen. Whilst Woody Allen's talent is indisputably in the greater of leagues in terms of writing, creativity and direction the above mentioned team come almost on par with 4 heads working together.So here with me so far I have the high potent script and a leading man who is a guru of the genre. Why didn't I feel THE VOW flicking on the switches for waterworks in the audience? Michael Sucsy is the main man in charge of the end product, as a director in his debut, it is felt he isn't thorough in covering all his bases. Sucsy misses out on recreating the dreamy atmosphere of love Tatum and McAdams is wrapped in; he misses out on focusing on a musical score that would personify the circumstances of the movie. In general he has done a good job but has missed out on fine tuning and tweaking it for the extra mile. I sense he is content and stopped trying at one point of time in the production. There is a learning curve in all we do and if this is what Michael Sucsy managed on his debut direction; I would for sure keep tabs on him for his next movie since he truly has potential.Leo a small time business owner who runs a recording studio is married to Paige and is a couple who are so much in love. Leo a man who believes that life is a collection of moments and memories put together is shattered when he and his wife are in a horrific car crash. Leo and Paige both survive. However Paige's recovery takes longer than Leo since she is in a coma and wakes up with loss of her memory. Paige does not remember her husband nor does she recall her marriage. Much like the TV show SAMANTHA WHO or 50 FIRST DATES; its up to to Leo to make his wife fall in love with him all over again.

62,CMTiago,A solid movie among the genre,7,5 June 2014,"The Vow is one of the most recent romantic dramas to come out and despite this being a genre which can be a hit or miss, I usually tend to at least like them, with some cases being exceptional. With this film, I felt invested enough to care about the characters and their stories, therefore I believe this to be an OK movie. The plot is about a young married couple who, after suffering a car accident, must now deal with the problem of the wife's memory loss. The problem is amplified by the fact that Paige (the wife) doesn't remember anything from her 4 year marriage to Leo. Leo must now work to reconquer his loved one, while trying to deal with Paige's ordeal to find out why she left her old life and shut out her family, to go and live in the city. I would say both the leads and the secondary actors do a good job with their roles. As for the rest, I would say the movie is similar to movies of this kind. In the end, this movie is one that most woman will like as it appeals to them more, while some guys may have a hard time getting through it. As for me, I can say I enjoyed it and might see it again in the future in case the time calls for itRating 7/10",The Vow
63,bob_bear,Throughly enjoyable...except for the f*rt gag...,7,14 August 2012,"Throughly enjoyable...except for the f*rt gag...And the f*rt gag is worth mentioning because it was foul.Otherwise, switch off your brain and enjoy the gorgeous Channing Tatum laugh, cry and bare his beautiful buns -- and all in the name of love.It's a film that doesn't bear much examination. It's a chick flick with a dumb heroine (why are they always artists???) who wouldn't know love unless it smacked her in the gob...which it eventually does.The reveal where we find out why she originally changed so radically is like: Oh, get over yourself, girlfriend! The punishment hardly fits the crime...unless you're 12.But who cares. It's a fairytale. And for me it worked.",The Vow
64,JankiSharma,true unconditional love,9,25 February 2012,"The Vow directed by Michael Sucsy focuses on the relationship between Paige ( Rachel McAdams) and Leo(Channing Tatum), two young, pleasant, good looking girl and boy. The relationship starts with Leo liking the pretty face of Paige. The conversations are simple and natural. They get married and then are involved in a car accident. Leo gets away with minor bruises but Paige ends up in a coma and wakes up forgetting the past four years of her life, which are the years spent with Leo. Leo spends all his time and energy in trying hard to get back his love.The love of his life has the same physical attributes as before the accident but has no recollection of him as her love. Channing Tatum as Leo is very convincing in his expressions of love and frustration. He plays the role of epitome of husband material with conviction. Rachel McAdams as Paige is very convincing as someone who is struggling to remember her past and also someone who appreciates the efforts of the nice looking Leo who wants her to love him like she used to. The Vow has many touching moments when one can question the importance of time spent together by two people truly in love. Does one hold on to love shared for four years or does one have to spend more number of years together to hold on to their love like relationship between Paige's mother(Jessica Lange) and father( Sam Neill)? Does love become a habit? Director Michael Sucsy did a good job. Jessica Lange as Paige's mother was good as always ( was also in Grey gardens directed by Michael Sucsy). Though I did not know that the movie was based on a real incident and the couple Leo and Paige are still a couple and have kids, it is nice to see that real love can work around hurdles and be true to the Vow.",The Vow
65,n-mo,I died and went to Hipster Hell. What did I do to deserve this?,2,13 August 2012,"It's hard to conceive of a bigger waste of Rachel MacAdams, or a more revolting twist on a truly inspiring and touching story. Kim and Krickitt Carpenter are a down-to-Earth couple who loved life and whose faith helped them to navigate through the unknown and the unknowable. The movie wouldn't have had to include any explicit ""faith"" references to be truer to the real life story, but it would certainly have to have portrayed the protagonists as real humans.Instead, ""Paige"" and ""Leo"" believe in nothing but their nauseating hipster subculture, what has rightly been called the dead end of Western civilization. And their marital union is as shallow as it comes. There's no sign of commitment to building a home or a family or even doing some greater work together apart from patronizing cool independent movies and quirky inner-city restaurants. What the heck kind of ""vow"" are they trying to uphold? These characters hold absolutely no firm convictions, and it shows in the weak-willedness with which they approach their marital vows.Having said my piece about the concept, I'll turn to the production flaws. Tatum is dreadfully miscast - we would not expect a hukling, surly man to play such an insecure and rootless weasel as Leo -, and has absolutely no on-screen chemistry with MacAdams. The story is disjoint and completely unfocused. Paige's personal transmogrification backstory, when we learn of it, lacks believability, and what they do with that lacks even more believability. Still more aggravating is the cardboard cut-out nature of the family and friends she grew up around, (but then I suppose that's the way hipsters conceive of anyone who clings to something even slightly more perennial than their postmodern fake-cosmopolitain soup). The weak attempts to redeem and flesh out the ""bad guys"" (or some of them, at least) towards the end falls completely flat.Living in South Florida in the middle of last decade and going through a phase where my friends and I devoured British, Irish and French movies with considerable regularity, I lamented at one point that ""every recent European movie has to make it a point to show a man's a**."" As ""The Vow"" makes it clear, of course, that point is no longer limited to the Europeans. But perhaps the mooning is rather appropriate... after all, the movie is one big moon in the face of an audience who (unfortunately I have to include myself in this) was dumb enough to shell out money to sit in front of this poubelle. Just as in Naples, the trash workers were on strike when this one was tossed out.",The Vow
66,mmuggi,A little fine movie with a known premise,6,30 January 2021,"The Vow is a cute little movie with the somewhat familiar premise that the woman loses her memory, so the man has to make her fall in love with him again. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum do an honorable job, but the third act is sadly a bit convoluted, and it does not feel as natural as the rest of the film. An ok movie for a late night.",The Vow
67,austin-takahashi,The Vow (1.5 Stars),3,18 February 2012,"""The Vow"" is a badly written, poorly executed, and weakly acted melodrama about how amnesia allowed a married couple in Chicago to relive the early memories of their love. The only thing that's going for this inept love story is its release date. No doubt that the season of Valentine's Day will lead thousands of couples into watching movies like this, no matter how terrible they are. Last year's ""Valentine's Day"" made over 200 million dollars, despite an 18% score on Rotten Tomatoes. I present to you a rating so low, Michael Bay hasn't even been there (yet).""The Vow"" is currently holding on to a 30% rating, yet it made over 40 million dollars on its opening weekend in the United States. After discovering the statistics I just posted, I'm no longer sure why I'm still writing a review for this, since chick flicks are guaranteed to be box office hits when released near Valentine's Day. But I press on. Right now I think to myself, ""If this review causes a single person to cancel his or her plans regarding seeing this movie, then I'll have peace knowing that I have done something good for a fellow human being.""Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/the-vow-movie-review/",The Vow

This movie gives the viewer nothing to work with, you don't feel sad when they wont get back together (I secretly hoped they didn't just so it would be different)You don't feel happy when they do (sort of) get back together.

70,sribornagain-394-460163,Missed opportunity,5,13 June 2012,"What if the love of one's life wakes up one fine day having forgotten everything about the one she has loved day in day out & behaves totally like a stranger? How hurtful it would be to the other person who has loved her more than anything else in this world & has no one except her as his family? This is the crux of what ""The Vow "" is all about. With a material like this one would have liked the makers to have made a movie which should have been an emotional roller-coaster. But sadly something seem to be missing as a result the movie doesn't stir the emotions of the viewers. ""The Vow "" does have its moments but they are drowned under the larger mendaciousness which is an offshoot of derivative writing & not so great direction. Movie comes out a collage of events that we have seen in many movie of this genre & theme , especially clichéd things like a adulterous & conniving father of the amnesiac , protagonist who is a romantic old world guy married to a rich girl who has moved out of family to pursue her interest & independence , typical family dinner in which the poor struggling protagonist is ridiculed by the rich family members of his wife, the girl's ex-fiancé who tries to take advantage of the amnesia that she is currently affected from.....and it goes on and on. What makes this movie work in-spite of all those clichés is the wonderful acting by the lead , Channing Tatum & Rachel McAdams . Channing Tatum, who for the first time being presented with scope to showcase his acting skills , has utilized the opportunity well. As a lover happily married to the love of his life suddenly finding out she has forgotten everything about those romantic as well the married days after an accident & trying to get back his love one more time, Channing scores. Be it romance, frustration, expectation , disappointment , anger, despair ,Channing carries the movie on his shoulder supported amply by Rachel McAdams. Rachel does her job very well as a person torn between her past & the missing link in the present. Michael Brook & Rachel Portman have scored the background music which carry forward the narration & tries to instill in the emotions which the writing and the direction fails to do. Roger Stoffer's cinematography is good & special mention has to be made of the accident scene, wonderfully shot.Michael Sucsy has directed the movie written by him along with Abby Kohn & Marc Silverstein which is inspired by the book ""The Vow"" written by Kim Carpenter based on his own life & how he managed to win back his wife who totally forgotten everything about him.On the whole, ""The Vow"" could have been one of the best romantic movies of the year considering the scope it had with the basic premise of the movie, but in the end due to formulaic writing & direction it ends up as a very average movie, one time watch. Bottomline : Missed opportunity",The Vow

There are happy scenes, gross scenes, hot scenes, and very upsetting scenes. And every scene is executed by the actors flawlessly.This was a nice change of pace as apposed to Blue Valentine or The Time Travelers Wife, or even Driver.

74,blogurious,Not too shabby.,6,31 May 2012,"To forgive and forget is a very popular saying that goes a long way, especially when applied to its literal meaning. Our memories are precious to us and when they become part of who we are, losing them may seem like the end of a life. ""The Vow"" is a romantic movie based on true events that deal with the loss of those memories when they become the epicenter of your own life. It's a simple story, sadly realistic and yet strong enough to make you think about your own experiences and how they affect yourself and all the ones around you. Tatum tries hard to play a serious character who is full of hope and pain while McAdams leads the way as a victim fighting her way back to the life she used to have. They are both good in their own way and although the story loses a bit of pace along the way, ""The Vow"" stands as a nice movie, not too shabby.The tragic side of it is not as touching as I expected, but it still manages to get you involved, especially in those moments where love speaks for itself and you start wishing that, in spite of the whole sadness of it, you could experience that same strong feeling of dependency and yet true companionship.",The Vow
75,MosHr,Great drama/romantic-drama. Keeps its distance from clichés and cheesiness.,8,9 February 2012,"Eight years ago, in the same Valentine's day weekend, ""50 first dates"" hit the theaters and made memory loss into a romantic comedy. ""The Vow"" takes another form of memory loss but the same guy-forgetting effect to a romantic comedy setup. Paige (Rachel McAdams) loses the past five years of her memories; the past five years where he met and married her husband Leo (Channing Tatum). Then tada, the plot then circles back to the same need: he must make her fall in love with him again.Memory loss makes for good Valentine's day fodder because it can explore the concept of soul mates. If the girl loses the memory of the entire relationship, would she do it over with the same guy or would she forge new lives? After all, couples destined to be together should survive a memory loss.Away from the main plot engine, ""The Vow"" is a good romantic drama; it is given to very little of the usual confectioneries and cheesiness that comes with Valentine's day pushes. McAdams expertly portrays the stranger while Tatum expertly does the love-sick but often kicked puppy (or bulldog). Paige and Leo are art-school city ""hipsters""; them not being upper middle class, it provides some fresher and more interesting dynamics in the story telling.As a sideline, I think Leo probably has two really dumb and uncomfortable lines in the movies. The first being something about tingling hands of Thom Yorke's fingers and marriage. The second being when asked about if recording studio is a dying form because people can record on their computers, he goes on a long bubbly enthusiastic blabber about slapbacks and something else.Overall, ""The Vow"" makes for good Valentine's day movie but I think it also makes for good drama. Comparing it to the lame romantic comedies that have come to define this week of year at the movies, at least you won't be spend the entire length of the movie rolling your eyes and shaking your head.",The Vow
76,facebook-124-955845,"not bad, just expected more",7,10 February 2012,"Michael Sucsy makes his big screen directorial debut with The Vow, starring Rachel Mc Adams and Channing Tatum. The movie centers on a woman who loses her memory as a result of a car accident; and how her husband tries to recreate their life together in hopes that she will remember it. The decision to see The Vow was an easy one; I'm a big fan of Rachel McAdams and am starting to become of fan of Channing Tatum as well. I'm a sucker for a love story, so it was that reason that I believed I would at least like the movie. And like it I did, I just didn't love it. While the film seemed like something out of a Nicholas Sparks book, it's based on true events, and having known that I found myself drawn to the film's plot. There were a few things about the film that I didn't like. For starters, it felt as though the beginning of the film was rushed. At one point, not soon after the accident, an amnesic and banged up Paige is in the hospital and in the next scene she's up walking around with barely any scarring. I thought the movie would show more romance as well as Leo's efforts to win back Paige's heart and rekindle the love they shared. While the movie did focus on their love, it also included a fair amount of involvement with her parents, played very nicely by Sam Neil and the great Jessica Lange. Some could argue that the inclusion of the parents should be expected, since it was their daughter involved in the accident, I felt that too much time was spent on their past with Paige. I also would have liked to have seen more of Leo's attempts at helping Paige regain her memories of their life together and not as much time spent on her family trying to make up for things they did wrong. Throughout the film there were some very romantic scenes between Tatum's Leo and McAdams' Paige that convincingly showed their unconditional love; unfortunately, there just wasn't enough of them. In the end, I really did enjoy The Vow, and it's one that I will watch again when it comes out on DVD and Blu-ray. I think it makes for a nice date night film or something to see on Valentine's Day.

77,redeyedtree,Insightful,8,13 February 2012,"We have a friend that decades ago suffered traumatic amnesia and has never recovered those memories. She lost memory of her husband and three daughters. I always thought, 'aw that must be terrible'. I know that the real story that inspired this movie was different. I know that this movie is a movie and not a documentary but... the research, accuracy and reality is very spot on. I read that they didn't want to shave Rachel McAdams head because most people like her hair right where it is but the other details were accurate. The way they treat the amnesia and techniques they try to employ to bring those memories back were very real. The deep emotional consequences for all parties are horrendous and of the few people that suffer this type of permanent memory loss, very few have these intimate relationships preserved. My friend ultimately lost her first husband and three daughters. They couldn't handle her not remembering and her personality change and she could not handle living with strangers. I think The Vow was insightful for me and I hope it creates awareness in the community at large.",The Vow
78,amahlanand,A Sweet Charmer,7,26 May 2012,"Heralded as the new 'The Notebook' and incidentally being penned by the same author whilst including the same female lead, I discovered that 'The Vow' was not as deeply and profoundly romantic as I was led to believe. Nevertheless, I didn't find it hard to like this film in all its naïve, good-natured innocence. I appreciated the differentiation from positioning this as a tearjerking, moving romantic drama or even a standard romantic comedy instead borrowing aspects from both, even if leaning towards the former with some light-heartedness sprinkled on top. The one key consideration to take into account is that a comparison game will be mounted, particularly due to the similarities between this and Nicholas Sparks' other cinematic feature which has become an essential female charmer. The sweet and light way this story is presented makes it a far more universal and in many ways, a more enjoyable watch. You don't need such heavy intense focus, nor do you, for those who apply, need to worry too much about being emotionally affected. Let's put it this way, it certainly wasn't a Romeo and Juliet inspired tragedy. The couple and the strength of their connection in their relationship is what a keen eye would be looking out for. The initial meeting and bond was uneventful though, too uneventful for a story with foundations in the relationship. The romantic aspect wasn't absent but was far from overpowering. However, a different scenario emerges and thereon, Channing Tatum carries much of the impetus with the 'connection' when considering the unique circumstances. He is sadly implausible as a suitor to begin with but apart from this sketchy beginning, he acted his sense of discomfort and struggle quite convincingly. He has faltered in being emotionally convincing before but he looked in a new class here. Au contraire, we had the woman trying to find her identity. As always, Rachel McAdams is most affable in her role and continues to show her versatility as an actress. She doesn't just revert back to 'The Notebook' mode when thrust into a role and with a script that may evoke memories of it. She brings out a new distinct role and diverts your attention towards her in all her confusion. Her familial connection is probably the most suspect part of the film; It did not feel important enough, but in a way, it's a nice change to not have any strong, familial input in a romantic drama.So, here are the permutations. If you are a male, you would see this with a female partner or female friends. For females, it doesn't really matter. But, for a bunch of guy friends, not likely to be the fitting movie of choice.",The Vow
79,FFman-847-460126,Weak Take on Great Romantic Comedy Story,6,15 February 2012,"The Vow was made for the Valentine's Day audience. As I went into this movie on the evening of February 14th, the theatre was packed with couples. This movie gave them exactly what they paid for. There were plenty of cute moments that make you say, ""ahhhhhh."" There strange nostalgic moments that makes you realize exactly how much time Rachel McAdams forgot (wait for the moment when she turns to Channing Tatum and asks him who the President of the United States is).This movie delivered for the audience at large. But several problems persist. For such a unique perspective on memory loss, The Vow falls into the flow of the average romantic comedy. As the core of the storyline develops (which strangely reminds me of Terri Schiavo), I can't help but feel like I have seen this before. There were so many interesting possibilities that a memory-loss movie could pursue. Instead, the writing team (which is known for big star movies such as He's Just Not That Into You and Valentine's Day) decides to take the safe route. The writing team stops this movie from being great.Despite its problems, The Vow relies heavily on its actors. With Rachel McAdams, Channing Tatum, Sam Neill, and Scott Speedman (who I still see as the romantic interest from the TV hit ""Felicity), relying so heavily on your actors is perfectly alright. Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum have a chemistry that I didn't expect. This chemistry drives the storyline forwards and leads to several dramatic and hilarious scenes that will surprise you.I need to make a note about movies that are ""Based on a True Story."" It's difficult to take these story lines at face value. By basing a story on true events, the producers are hoping that you will not look too far into the plausibility of the situation. When you compare the movie with the true events, however, the differences are immense. Namely, the movie makes the crash result in one problem: the loss of several years of memories. In reality, the woman what badly hurt and also suffered from severe short term memory loss. The possibility of losing several years of memories and not haven't any other physical side-effects (aside form a tiny scar around her eyes) is almost entirely impossible.The Vow is cute enough to enjoy at face-value. If you are looking for a movie to simply enjoy and not think too deeply, this is the movie for you. 2012 has been an awful year for Romantic Comedies. One for the Money was dreadful. This Means War promises to be almost as bad. If you are pining for a romantic comedy, this will fill your appetite until the first great one of the year is released. Looking over the list of romantic comedies to be released, however, there isn't much. My money is on the new American Pie movie.",The Vow
80,MC1-Bjornson,An Earnest Vow . . .,8,2 May 2012,"""The Vow"", Rated ""PG-13"" for Adult Situations, Adult Language, Adult Humor, Sexual Content, Brief Partial Nudity & Mild Violence. Running Time: 1hr&44mns.My Take: *** (Out of ****) What if the person you loved more than anyone else in the entire world one day did not know you anymore? Can you imagine? I cannot begin to fathom the sorrow I would go through. Unfortunately, this is a reality for people dealing with loved ones suffering from Alzheimer's disease or from a traumatic brain injury.As I watched ""The Vow"", I imagined myself in the character of the husband's shoes. What startled me was how much of the movie actually reminded me of myself and of similar situations I've been in. I'll be honest; this movie definitely struck a chord with me.The movie opens with young Chicagoans Leo (Channing Tatum, ""21 Jump Street"") and Paige Collins (Rachael McAdams, ""The Time Traveler's Wife"") leaving a movie theater late one winter night. They are madly in love and it's obvious from the get-go they are best friends. While they are driving home on slick roads, fate intervenes. That's when we learn of ""moments of impact and ripple effects where some particles are brought closer and some are spun off into great adventures"" that happen in life.This is when a dump truck rear-ends the young couple's vehicle which sends Paige sailing through the windshield. During her hospital stay, she is put in a medically induced coma to help her recover. When Paige is revived her motor functions are good and her personality is sound. Leo is elated to see his wife on the mend, it appears she will not have any lasting injuries from the accident. Herein lays the ripple effect: Paige has no memory of Leo. She is unable to recall the last five-years of her life. This includes changing her college major, her works as an artist and sculptor, her estrangement from her parents, and how and why she met and married Leo.From Paige's perspective, Leo is a stranger. There is no passion for him as there once was. Without the last five years of memory, she still has feelings for her former fiancé, the handsome and somewhat snaky Jeremy (Scott Speedman, ""Underworld""). He never wanted his engagement to Paige to end. For him, this might be a chance to pick up where they left off.Leo's life is made even more complicated by Paige's meddlesome parents Bill (Sam Neill, ""Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole"") and Rita (Jessica Lange, ""Big Fish""). With Paige's memory of their estrangement gone her parents now have a chance to implement a life ""course correction"" for her. Bill and Rita never wanted Paige to assume the career she did, and they certainly do not approve of Leo.Channing Tatum is good as Leo. In spite of the many challenges that come from Paige trying to put the pieces of her life back together, he always tries to remain calm and even keeled. This is no small task for a man who, for the most part, lost his true love to ""a moment of impact"". Though hurt, he is determined to play straight with Paige and let her make her own decisions, including what she now wants to do with her life. Truly, if you love someone enough you will let them go.""The Vow"" is aptly named. It is the very premise of the Collins' wedding vows the movie is framed upon. What's interesting to note, is our couple wrote their wedding vows on their copies of the menu from the café prominent during their initial courtship: the Mnemonic Café. Nice touch with the name.""The Vow"" was inspired by the real-life couple Kim and Kickitt Carpenter. They were married for only ten weeks when an auto accident robbed Kickitt of knowing her husband at all. When asked ""Who's your husband?"" Kickitt responded with ""I'm not married"". Tests revealed she had only maintained her long-term memories. She no longer had any feelings for her husband Kim. ""I don't have a visual memory in my head, and I have no memory in my heart."" The Carpenters faced over $200,000 in medical bills for Kickitt's care. Kim did not think their marriage could survive. ""This isn't my wife; my wife is in this body, trapped and trying to get out."" Kim valued their marriage and was determined to make it work. ""I made a vow before God. 'Until death do you part'."" It's been nearly 20 years since the accident. Today, they are happily married and have two children. Kickitt never did regain the memories she lost.""The Vow"" took creative liberties with the actual events of which it is based. A movie like this could have easily gone in so many directions. As it is, it is a bittersweet love story that deals with loss and heartache. How the movie resolves itself feels reasonably honest and noble.I don't know if I would have had the stamina, will-power or heart that poor Leo had. He's a very idealist character with great personality traits and few or no flaws. Many couples probably wouldn't have handled this situation as well as the Collins. But the Carpenters did and that is a testament to their faith and determination.""The Vow"" works best as a date movie. If I had to complain, some events take place feel a little too convenient. An example is the scene where Paige meets a former acquaintance in the floral store. That chance encounter is there to provide a plot twist, but it felt a bit much and a little too late. Oh, well. I can forgive that and some of the other clichés. After all, this movie has heart. That's what brings this story home. For this kind of movie, isn't that what really matters?",The Vow
81,synevy,Welcome to the soft side,7,31 March 2012,"While i was waiting for 'The Vow' to be something like '50 First Days' and that kind of movies, surprise - surprise, nothing like that. Still a chick flick but an interesting one to watch.The story is based on true events and that urges you more to find out how these situations are being dealt with. Paige and Leo is a young married couple living a happy life when a car accident turn things over in their relationship. Although they both recover from it, Paige suffers a serious memory loss that has wiped out a large range of important events in her life. Being married with Leo is one of them. From that moment on, Leo tries to find ways to start winning her heart all over again.Now if you gotten used to the action man Channing Tatum, get over it (Step Up and Dear John might show you how). I'll tell you, he's very good in this film and i enjoy actors who choose to play parts in various-genre movies and challenge themselves. Rachel McAdams remains the sweet and complex 'Notebook' girl and knows how to handle this role. They made a good match. As always, i'm happy to see Sam Neill -who plays Paige's father here- in any kind of film! I liked the settings and photography. It's modern, warm and creative. The soundtrack's been composed by Michael Brook and Rachel Portman and carries various tracks by older and recent artists like The National, Voxhaul Broadcast, Scott Hardkiss, even Meat Loaf.So, it's worth the watch (by both genders) and don't worry, you won't have to shed a tear.

They both get into a car accident and Paige ends up with five years worth of memory erased. (Which she appears to be unnaturally calm and unsurprised about) Turns out her big bad WASP family don't approve of her ""alternative"" husband (seriously, how many times have we seen that??)Honestly not much else happens from that point.

Now the film itself is based around something both me and my partner appeal to , memory loss and fighting to gain that love back threw all the odds no matter what anyone says to you, we are both idiots to assume this was going to be as good as The Notebook. Both films are about different things but under a similar premise so we assumed we might have a good cry and enjoy a emotional packed film.We was wrong , from the word go this film didn't pick up it was just so dull and the characters where not living up to their standards that i saw in the trailer , we thought the whole film was going to be about the main character trying to get the love of his lifes memory back but it was so full of crap from the past we barely got a chance to fall in love with the characters , no where in the trailer does it mention it was going to be a timeline type of film and it was and that was a very disappointing aspect. Not once did i ever feel a connection between Rachel McAdams AKA Paige and Channing Tatum aka Leo before and after the crash they just seemed like hooligans.All in all i would of much rather of watched the muppets and im so annoyed i didn't now.Miss Piggy And Kermit the frog could of pulled off a more believable film.",The Vow

Personally I liked the fact that it doesn't have a perfect, happily ever after ending, wrapped up nicely with a bow, but it still has a happy ending of sorts. The fact that it's inspired by a true story makes it that much better. Both Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum give great performances, and it has a pretty good supporting cast.

By the ending you'll agree with the new direction and all the subtle hints it lay along the way made sense. The main characters hit the right notes as were a fine supporting cast. Cudos to the director who paced the story sensibly and measurably. Personally I like the male lead (Tatum) the most. Everything he did was honest and believable. The female lead (McAdams) played someone who was justifiably confused and acted as should be. Great cinematography and memorable snow scenes.

90,imvaughn,Expected More Very Disappointment,4,16 December 2013,I am very disappointed in this movie. I watched this on Starz today and was really excited to see the movie. The summary stated it was about a woman who gets in a car accident and doesn't remember her husband when she comes out of the coma. Here I am with my box of Kleenex in hand ready for a solid chic flick tear jerker. Instead I received a C- movie where in the end I hate the Paige and just felt sorry for Leo.This is called the VOW. It is supposed to show a couple who in the end triumphs all and remembers their vows. I mean we literally either see them say their vows or read their vows 4xs during the movie. Instead here is what we get: 1. A woman who comes out of her coma and doesn't act like Leo is her husband. She treats him like crap and doesn't even attempt to remember 2. A woman who is more interested in getting back to her old (pre-fall out with her family) life than take the time to remember her real friends and husband.3. A woman who is more interested in getting back with her ex-fiancé' than even TRY to work it out with her current husband.4. A woman who is willing to divorce this said husband and doesn't feel 1 ounce of remorse.5. A woman who finally learns that her ex is douche and her family is pack of liars and then wants to go find her husband to talk.No romance at all. Their love story is very rushed at the beginning. By the end of this movie I hate Paige. I don't care if she ever gets her memory back and I am really rooting for Leo to find true love somewhere else.This is NOTHING like what it advertised. This is a depressing movie. This isn't a tear jerker. This isn't a love story. We don't even know they stay together in the end except that they give a 2 line closing that they stayed together.Instead of focusing on how mean Paige can be Leo they should have broken up the time as such: 30 mins of truly introducing us to Paige and Leo and showing what made their love story great. ( A few flashbacks didn't cut it) 30 mins focusing on the accident and her memory loss 20 mins of suspense where the audience isn't sure if they will ever find their back to each.25 mins showing them re falling in love again Instead we received: 10 minutes of them introducing the love story. 70 mins of them showing Paige be a witch and not even try to care about Leo or regaining her memory. 14 mins of them living apart. 10 minutes of them deciding to go out to eat and try.DISAPPOINTED!!,The Vow
91,devastationfilms1,Clichéd and cheesy but still a good film.,7,11 February 2012,"okay, so i went with my gf to see this, since i drag her to every war/action film that i can. this film is very clichéd and cheesy, but hey its actually a good movie. your going to see a romance movie,....their all the exact same dude. girl is in love, something happens, girls not in love anymore, guy wins her back, happy ending for all. its just how romance works. but, since i want to be a film director, I have to be honest. SOME of the performances played by Tatum and McAdams are great and awesome and fantastic,....but ever since i left the movie I have been noticing things. a lot of the emotions and feelings are very forced, and you can see it in their faces. I mean, at least do another take of the scene and get it right? but anyways,...most, if not all, of the actions that Paige makes after the accident are predictable as all Hell. You KNOW what will happen before it happens. But, its a romance chick flick, what were you expecting?and lastly, every single one of these brain injury, memory loss love stories are so clichéd in the fact that every doctor plays stupid about it.

94,lamiaaos,"A Cute Love Story, but",6,29 February 2012,"I have to admit that after watching Channing Tatum's acting skills grow, he appears to have made a milestone progress since ""She's the man"" and ""Step up"". There was one scene in particular that I found quite striking, one where he and Rachael were having a heated discussion during a wedding. And for the very first time, Channing succeeded in conveying emotions during his performance.All in all, this movie is quite a decent attempt in the RomCom domain, but just like most movies in this genre, it managed to fall hard into the trap of having both a rushed and predictable ending. But, as it was indeed based on a ""true story"", then I believe it is well worth noting that the banality of the climax was somewhat inevitable. However, I could not get over the fact that the finale was rushed through in what seemed like no more than ten minutes.What gave this movie its charm, was the delightful plot, which in my opinion was not portrayed as well as it could've. It seemed freakishly similar to ""The notebook"", and with one of the main actors unchanged as well.Rachael is a very capable actress, but she somehow flunks when it comes to making her acting appear natural, and unfortunately, there was an element of ""forcing it"" when it came to the believability of her role.I am starting to warm up to Channing quite a bit, and hopefully he'll flourish more as an actor in the near future, as he still requires some work in order to be recognized as a well-established performer.To sum up, this is a RomCom film with a lovable story and a concealed message about never giving up that may not be so concealed after all.6.5/10",The Vow
95,antoniomagallon90,Probably the best chick-flick film that I've seen and I'm a guy,7,18 March 2012,"Poor Leo (Channing Tatum), his life is changed after him and his wife Page (Rachel McAdams) got into a car accident. Her memories are completely wiped out and can't even remember him. Her last memory that she had, she previously engaged to her boyfriend Ryan (Lucas Bryant). Her parents Bill and Rita (Sam Neil and Jessica Lange) wants her back home, but Leo doesn't appreciate that because he knows something that Page and we as the audience don't know what secrets he is holding. Her life is going to be complicated for the rest of her life.What surprising about The Vow is how much I enjoyed it, well most of it. The plot was well told, even though it is familiarize. This is not the first time that I see a film about someone that either lost their memory or have to start over or never to recover, but then again it happened to a real life couple who inspire the movie. The Vow can be cliché, but at least the plot was presented well. Shockley, the scrip was well written despite several scenes that were cheesy here and there. What is rare for this genre is how much we care about the characters. Just imagine going through his situation and knowing that you will never see your love one recovering their memories again. Although I enjoy the movie, there are some problems. Rachel McAdams is not the best actress, but she is talented, which I respect. This is her best role, but at the same time I see her in other romantic films. Channing Tatum does play a good character, but his acting ability is not impressive. For the last two years that I've see him acting, he doesn't have the ability to act. Sometimes I feel that he should have taken more acting classes. What bothers me the most is that you got two actors that are known for romantic genres and put them together in one movie, especially how they marked the movie (Tatum was in Dear John and McAdams was in The Notebook). If the filmmakers or the studio were to cast unknown actors, it would have been fine for me. Even though the story takes place in Chicago, there were several shot in the background that you see Toronto. Listen if you want to shoot in Chicago you better shoot the whole damn movie in my beloved city. Poor Chicago, why is it happening to us? Also some people, mainly ladies, have told me that I was expected to cry while watching The Vow. It didn't happen to me, although I felt sorry that for what both of had to go through, so I guess you can say I was so what emotional.The Vow is a good romantic film, but it is not the greatest as people say it is. This is one of those films that I can only see it once and never to watch it again for another couple of years.

Denzel couldn't have saved it. Had the potential to be really good. I strongly believe Channing Tatum was miscast in this role. Did not fit him in the least bit. I'm thinking Joseph Levitt or Josh Hartnett would of been a better lead. The movie plays out totally different then how I think the average viewer would imagine.

Unfortunately, beyond the A-class acting (from all but Channing) and excellent production quality, it bears little resemblance to the incredible and compelling actual events. Sony seemed to go to great lengths to wildly embellish this story, even so far as to note the ""inspired by actual events"" rather than being ""based on a true story"" as usually seen. The movie was frankly an hour and a half of tribulation and agony with a glimmer of hope right before the end credits. There was no encouraging balance or climactic triumph to be inspired by at the end. The most disappointing aspect of the movie was the fact the faith of the couple - which drove and sustained them through the actual events - was completely absent in the film. The promescuity and infidelity of the film weren't even factual and I find it disturbing that the original couple's integrity is tarnished by this mildly scandelous account. I was intrigued by the original story. This movie was interesting, but not compelling or even inspirational with its completely worldly framework.

Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams star in ""The Vow"", the newest 'romantic tragedy' about a married couple, Leo and Paige, who get in a disastrous car accident. Leo (Tatum) wakes up intact, however, when Paige (McAdams) wakes up from a coma, she has no recollection of the last five years of her life. These five years conveniently include her entire relationship with Leo.The last part of Paige's life that she can remember is going to law school and being engaged to a man named Jeremy (Scott Speedman). As this time, she is closest with her family because they are the only people in her life that she can clearly remember.Leo believes that spending time with him in their home and going through her daily routine might help Paige remember the last five years of her life. When she tries living with Leo, who is a complete stranger to her, she has extreme difficulty feeling comfortable.The bulk of the movie is about Paige trying to bring back the lost years. It gets quite depressing. There are very few scenes that make the audience smile; there is much more crying involved.This is definitely more of a chick flick, but not a very good one. The acting isn't great, there is very little chemistry between McAdams and Tatum, and the script is poorly written. The story sure had high expectations.

They made plenty of effort to let you get to know the characters, but I'm not sure it was enough and initially it all felt a bit wooden. As the movie progressed and you got to know the characters, you started to warm to them, especially Leo's character played by Channing Tatum. By the time I'd got half way through, I wanted to know how this would play out and I was bothered. The movie is based on true events, which added something to it I think.

The following contains general spoilers, not specifics.What really turned me off about this movie was that anyone thought this story was inspiring enough to put it on screen. I was shocked when I found out it was based proudly on a real story. Let me tell you I would not want to know the woman who was the inspiration for Paige. The movie portrayed Paige after the accident, but they don't really show us much of what she as like before the accident. The few glimpses give us the impression that she was a woman who loved life and honored the bond of marriage. I don't buy it. Losing your memory may change things, but, it does not change your underlying personality. Paige didn't turn into a selfish, uncaring _itch. She probably always was one.A decent woman would have put some effort into recovering her marriage and would have, at the very least, had some respect for the man she was married to. This woman didn't care that she was ripping this poor man's heart out. She cared for no one but herself. At least as far as the movie was concerned, she never gave much thought to anyone but herself. She was, after all, not the only one who was going through a traumatic, life-changing experience and she was not the only one injured in the car crash. If this story is actually true, my heart goes to the woman's real family.This should never have been immortalized in film. It is the very epitome of the ""me"" generation.

If you picked the second drink, this review is done for you. Thanks for reading this far. If you would rather drink the oj, then skip seeing the movie and read the account of what really happened. I read a Reader's Digest version last night after the movie (rather like canned condensed oj) and was blown away by how powerful the real story was and how it could have been portrayed. I won't go into the real account here, except to say that there were a married man and woman who were in a car accident that caused her amnesia. Other than that NOTHING is anything like the movie. The title of the movie comes from the self written vows that Paige and Leo have at their wedding, done by a friend. This helps Leo keep going. But we never quite get why, and the movie has a major change from reality that really trashes the concept. In the real world the couple are very strongly Christian and believe very firmly in their wedding vows. This and their faith sustains them. I think the movie was watered down because I think they thought no one would go see a romantic drama based on strong faith, especially Christianity, right now. That's my take on it. I'm not ""Christian"" but I have no problems with people being faithful. Rated PG for mild language, sexual situations, partial nudity. Okay for you ladies, Channing Tatum's butt. Don't take the kids and bore the crap out of them.",The Vow
106,rsmall1806,A married couple keep their vows.,6,19 May 2012,"The Vow (2012) Rachel McAdams' good looks, sparkling personality and good supporting actors make this biopic compelling. Kim and Krickitt Carpenter wrote the book entitled The Vow about their marriage that was interrupted by memory loss. The movie is taken from their book. I did not read the book but my impression from the beginning of the film is that the actors do very well in making the biopic accurate in a very exciting and challenging situation. After about half of the running time of almost two hours I began to wonder how and when this film would end. This is because of subplots, that although very well acted, almost make one movie into several movies. I became anxious to see what happens to the lives of this couple. This feeling increased until I finally fast forwarded the film to the end. I recommend The Vow for viewers who can enjoy complicated subplots without being losing interest in the main direction of the movie. The film is successful commercially but did not get good reviews. This could have been an A movie had screenwriters and directors tightened the plot. R.Small",The Vow
107,TopekaLass,Romantic and heavy on the drama,6,23 February 2012,"Written by Jason Katims, Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (screenplay), Stuart Sender (story) and directed by TV director Michael Sucsy, The Vow tries very hard to be the romantic love story that will hit you hard emotionally. I'm not sure if it truly succeeds, but it also doesn't really disappoint. I would say that it has a lot of heart. There may be obstacles in the way of this movie really affecting the audience. Maybe too many writers? As talented as they may be, the movie does not click quite as well as it should.The cast is fine. The music and set direction is pretty good. It is a very good premise - A car accident puts a woman in a coma, she comes to with her memory lost, and then her husband Leo has to win her love all over again. Maybe if it didn't rely on sentimentality as much, but is just somehow misses. I must admit though, for me, there were a couple tear jerking moments.

108,EduardoSandrini79,Predictable,5,14 April 2012,"The Vows suffers from a problem all bad romantic comedies have, you can see things coming a mile away.The Vow is based on a true story, where a young wife loses her memory (the last 4 years) and has to deal with being married to someone she doesn't even know anymore. The premise is quite interesting and has lots of potential. And the fact that is inspired by a true story makes it even more dramatic.However none of that is put into practice. The characters are unidimensional, they are just way too perfect from the get go. And when someone new is introduced to the story, they only work as a source of conflict (like the over controlling father or the ex-boyfriend that is still in love with her after 4 years and is a detestable person).All performances are also uninspiring and trivial with special negative emphasis to Channning Tatum's work.If you are a big fan of rom-coms maybe you can still manage to enjoy your time with The Vow.

If you read the book the movie will bear near zero relation to it other than the part where a woman loses her memory. Had I checked it out beforehand on some of the rating sights I would never have watched it due to the blasphemy and profanities it contains.

Guys should take their chicks to watch this wonderful movie, because it's worth the money. don't MISS this movie, a must see for everyone. The romance between both of them was mind blowing.

113,crazy_Lil_angel4534533,Not believable,4,9 February 2013,"For me, the movie started off really strong, but by then end I was rolling my eyes and giving myself face palms. I'm still not sure why Channing Tatum even has a legitimate career as an actor, because in every movie I see him in, he plays the SAME DAMN CHARACTER: the supposed hunk, who's ultra man, but also sensitive and ""sweet."" He always does that stupid chortle followed by his shy/stupid word stuttering. I wish I could say that Channing Tatum single handedly killed this film, but unfortunately Rachel McAdams was a major culprit too. For me, this is probably one of Rachel's most disappointing performances. I didn't believe her character, because there was no passion. I didn't believe that she loved her husband...I just didn't believe her because she was so detached and cold. Not to mention her character was so annoying, just because you lose your memory doesn't mean you become a whole other person. But - maybe that's just the directors fault. What I find really disheartening about this movie is that it's actually based on a heart wrenching story about a woman who lost her memory, and through her faith in God and her husband she rekindled their love. However, I feel like in the midst of the director striving to be non secular, he completely lost the heart and passion of the whole story. All in all this felt like a watered down, insincere story about two supposed lovers who never really loved each other at all. Not impressed.",The Vow

The beautiful ceremony in the art gallery (it's so me!) and the heartwarming vows between them. Paige's wedding dress and her studio.This movie is beautiful but most importantly based on real events.

115,cspuria,Not so wow but okay,6,22 July 2012,"After reading the reviews I had low expectations so it was a little better than I thought it would be. At the beginning and the end it indicates that it's based on true events, but it's hard to consider that it would be anywhere close to real life. The cliché of Paige's over-protective and controlling rich parents was trite if not predictable. It all seemed a little bit ""Cocktail"" to me, especially given that the time line seemed circa late 80s (maybe early nineties - it was hard to tell). As for the actors, I liked the casting of Canadians Scott Speedman (of Felicity in the 90s) and ? as Lily (from Being Erica). Of the main characters, Channing Tatum is always nice to look at and Sam Neil rarely disappoints. R. McAdams is better in other films so I wasn't thrilled with her Meg Ryanesque performance. And Jessica Lange's plastic surgery seemed a little creepy, although she gives a worthy speech near the end, which was probably the best acting in the whole show.

McAdams and this Channing Tatum have negative chemistry. It is all contrived. He's a jock that is trying to sell us on being an artist and studio producer? Terrible sales job. And McAdams I think phoned this one in. I feel for her, she didn't have a lot to work with.Geez. This is a negative review. I generally like to be positive. But this was a grinder at best.

118,moviegirl181,A beautiful and romantic movie,7,11 February 2012,"I got dragged to see ""The Vow"" by Michale Sucsy by a couple of my teenage friends and I ended up quite liking this movie as it was very enjoyable and romantic. Set in a beautiful and comfortable city, The Vow tells the story of a nice and cute couple who are very much in love. But the problem is perfectly shown when Paige (Rachel McAdams) has memory loss after being in a car accident with her beloved husband, Leo (Channing Tatum). And there things start to unfold.This movie was so interesting and romantic to watch as we also get to see the first life Rachel and Leo have together before the accident and how they came to be together. The reason why I loved this movie was because it is set in a city, unlike many other romance movies and the life the characters have is interesting. The scenes were beautiful and comfortable with an excellent soundtrack therefore the story seemed so real. And the characters seemed real too; Paige is a sculptor artist who has left her family to follow her heart and Leo owns a recording studio. The movie mainly focuses on Paige's actions and reactions played so well by Rachel McAdams who was prefect for the role and connected so well to her character who had 2 very different lives; the one before and after the accident. And this is the best I've seen of Channing Tatum. I have never been impressed with his acting ability but here he puts on a marvellous performance never seen before. His character seemed so real and I was able to connect with his emotions; the sadness and frustration of losing his beloved wife. And put it together, Tatum and McAdams were excellent, the romantic showed their comfort and connection with each other.I would have loved to score this movie 10 out of 10 due to the characters and setting but the storyline lost it towards the end after starting off so perfectly. It was a bit of a disappointment to actually watch Leo give up his effort to win Paige's heart back, even going for a divorce after her Dad's encouragement. The movie didn't end the way we were expecting where Paige slowly regains her affections for Leo and her former life.Apart from the flaws with the ending, ""The Vow"" is beautiful and romantic story that lives up to its expectations (except for the ending) . It was much better than other movies of romance such as ""Dear John, ""The Last Song"" and ""Letters to Juliet"". The Vow has a very original and interesting storyline and is sure not to disappoint.

That said though, I could have easily watched another 30 minutes of this. No one was ready for it to end and that's a good sign. The plot is what it is, being based on a true story and all.

However, in this secular movie, the couple's faith and actual wedding vows before God are judiciously scrubbed from the movie.

I get that this story is as emotionally decimating for her as it is for him. What I don't understand is why she actively resists Tatum as if he were some sort of troll. They work into the script that she used to be an entirely different person before she met him, and before a certain event changed her perception of her family and her own identity. But until we find out what that event is, we are left with the staggering, black-and-white personality about-face which she seems all too happy to embrace.

Channing Tatum convinced me every step of the way of all of his emotions. To watch him love her so intensely when she can't remember him at all was very difficult. The fact that he suffered in silence to avoid hurting her was astounding. He took all that heart break on so she could find herself on her own terms.Rachel McAdams did an excellent job playing the confused and lost woman who is trying to remember all the things that changed everything about her.

The only similarity to 50 First Dates is that both the female leads suffer from amnesia with their respective significant others trying to win her heart. The Vow actually comes across having a feel more like The Notebook.It's the story of the romance between Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams), and who are victims of a car accident. Leo recovers, but Paige emerges with no memories of her whole relationship nor marriage to Leo, and he must now make her fall in love with him again. In her mind, as Leo says in one of the trailers for this movie, she's still engaged to her ex-fiancé.The movie manages to avoid cheap Hollywood writing, and gently leads you down its plot. Just when you think you might know where the story is going, it heads in a different direction. Details are revealed to you layer by layer as Paige discovers them.

It may be a girly tearjerker, but it is directed so well, and the music fits so perfectly, that you just sink into the story, and feel the pain of the couple. Brilliant movie, even if it is just another heartwarming chick flick, it's definitely worth a watch.",The Vow
140,annapintus2,I vow never to watch this again...,4,15 February 2013,"In an attempt to avoid the pit falls of clichéd melodrama, The Vow is based on a true story, which unsurprisingly and ironically does the complete opposite. Michael Sucsy directs as lovebirds Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo's (Channing Tatum) lives are almost literally turned upside down when a truck rams into the back of their car, leading to the consequences that make up this romantic weepy.Waking from a coma, Paige can no longer remember her new free spirited, artistic life and marriage to Leo and instead reverts to her old upper-middle class stuffy ways. A series of events follows as Leo attempts to trigger her memory and remind her that, yes her father is a cheating scumbag and yes she has a tattoo and yes she is in fact a talented sculptor. Does she listen however? Well it's not hard to guessMcAdams' portrayal of Paige is sneakily reminiscent of the equally confused Claire in The Time Traveller's Wife, leaving this latest attempt a little one dimensional. In a similar way to the film failing to avoid melodrama, McAdams fails to replicate the intensity and passion behind her performance in the classic tear jerker The Notebook. Surprisingly it is Channing Tatum, with his smooth and heartbreaking portrayal of a man who struggles to accept that he is a stranger to the woman he loves, that helps the production rise from the ashes. He brings a certain level of sincerity to a dangerously clichéd premise.Unfortunately like many films nowadays, The Vow is another one of those 'good idea, bad execution' jobs. For no more than a date movie however, all of the above could most likely be bypassed.",The Vow

I was very surprised to learn that this movie is based on actual events, perhaps this was why it was not just another amnesia movie. Therefore not entirely predictable. The struggles seemed a little abbreviated, but genuine. Leo (the husband) had a noticeable lack of grief, even in the most down point.This is a great example of a couple facing a great difficulty, particularly a husband's love. But it failed to truly pull deep emotion out of me (and I can get choked up pretty easily).This is appropriate for most teen and up audiences. All intimation of sex are between a married couple. There is full backside nudity of Tatum Channing, but it fits appropriately in the movie.My last ""negative"" point is that it seemed slow, particularly at the beginning.

He seemed to go through the actions without any of the emotional attachment that I've seen him portray in other movies he has been in. Ashley, on the other hand had a much easier part to play as there was no emotional attachment to portray and she played her part quite well.

When it came out in 2012, I probably would have liked it because of the actors and the fact that the main character is an artist. But after my husband survived a severe car accident of his own, and also with traumatic brain injury, this movie takes on new meaning for us both. Thankfully, and because I prayed specifically for a miracle for my marriage leading up to my husbands accident; my husband woke up from his coma knowing me! At the point of my husbands accident we had been married for 27 yrs, and we were high school sweethearts. So I was engrained in his long term memories. But otherwise I think we could have easily been this couple in the movie.I read many a review on here saying that they thought it was weird or out of the ordinary that the main character would wake up and have lost all of their most recent memories. Because we have lived this, it was very realistic that this would happen, and loved that this movie showed this very real occurrence. And it's why many couples do not stay together after one of them has had a TBI.Don't watch this movie expecting a traditional romance and don't watch it if you don't like cheesy. But if want to see a story of true love, a fight to regain a life after trauma, watch this!! You're gonna love it!I also read in the reviews that the couple who inspired this movie were disappointed and upset that the movie left out their Christian beliefs.

But that's what bothered me, I cried FOR him, not WITH him. I think Leo should have been much more emotional and frantic about the possibility of losing his wife. There weren't many tears from him and there should have been. Saying this, I still think Channing Tatum did a very good job as the innocent husband.

We should have gone and seen Star Wars instead.First off, I'm not a very huge chick-flick person, but hey, it's nice to see a good one every once in a whileone that makes you feel good anyway. I loved the beginning of the movie where we saw Paige (Rachel McAdams) and Leo (Channing Tatum) meet and fall in love and get married. You could definitely see the chemistry there. Then there was the wreck and Paige forgets her married and before life with Leo and thinks she's still in law school (which she had dropped out of many years ago) and that she's engaged to some other guy that was her fiancé then (Justin, I think?). And that's where the movie got bad. Leo tried and tried to make her fall in love with him again, and the one redeeming point in the middle of the movie was when he asked her out on a date to the places they frequented before the accident, which went GREATyou could see the chemistry there! Then her father mentions divorcing her and soon we see him signing divorce papers. Then much later (I believe a month or so) we see him walking towards his apartment with another girl (while Paige is on his steps, upset, waiting for him, because she found out about something in her immediate family). If he cared about her so much how could he just GIVE UP like that? I know he tried or whatever. But seriously? Give up. Divorce her. Be sad a little. Find a new chick. Whatever. I also realize he wanted her to be happy. But really? REALLY? If you're going to do this then don't even bother making the stupid movie because it'll just make everyone feel bad.

I know the end was supposed to be ""if we're meant to be, we will be"" or whatever but don't feed me that crap. The whole movie just gave me this awful vibe of ""there's no such thing as true love"" and what the HECK he just completely gave up on her?! This movie had SUCH potential!!

One thing that I would have liked to see more of would be the back stories to some characters. The major plot change (the crash) happens very early on in the movie, without many screen moments where the lives of the two lovers weren't disfigured by the car crash, which doesn't give the mind of the audience much to compare too.

Rachel McAdams, Channing Tatum, and Jessica Lange are all decent (good even) in their roles. Most of my disappointment was because of the fact that the majority of the movie was focused on the fact that she didn't remember Leo or their relationship, as well as all of her family and friend problems. I had hoped that the writers would show more of Leo trying to romance her a second time (i.e. going on dates, spending time together) but this wasn't exactly the case. When the movie started, viewers felt bad for the couple and hoped they would reunite, but while you spend the whole movie hoping, the ending falls flat and comes to an abrupt halt. The movie basically has you fill in the blank and use your imagination for the ending. It felt a bit unrewarding - almost as if the writers had let you down.

It's like watching 50 first dates again, except the girl doesn't 'reset' every day, she just doesn't remember anything beyond when she and her husband met, and it's extraordinarily, extremely, exceedingly, immeasurably boring. At one point my wife looked at me during the movie and asked if I was feeling OK. That's how dull this movie was. Poor acting and writing killed this film. Unfortunately, those two things are about the only important things in the film business.The characters are very under-developed. I don't know anything about them beyond their names and how they met. Other characters seem to be in the film just to drag it on and try to add some excitement to an otherwise arid performance.I give this a 2 because this film managed to make the girl in front of us cry. My wife even hated it, and she was going in with the intention of buying it when it came out.Save yourself $30 and 2 hours of your life. Go see something else on valentine's day.",The Vow
173,bpeterson101,Brilliantly Executed! Magnificent Screenplay!,10,14 February 2012,"This is my first review, so you may take it with a grain of salt. I usually spend a lot of time reading reviews but never care to write. I was so impressed by this film that I just had to write something and share with the IMDb world what an amazing film this is. I was dragged to this movie by my wife. I don't really care for these kinds of movies, but as I sat there watching the film I became so intertwined with the characters. This movie does an excellent job at building the characters and allowing you to feel the emotion. I wouldn't really recommend this film to single guys, maybe a group of girls, but being married and having a sense of understanding of that kind of love is being portrayed really made an impact on me, so a definite yes to couples! There were many things in that film that I could relate to which was amazing, tears and laughter! I also love how this film portrayed marriage. Anymore these days films are skewing the way marriage should be, and how we should treat one another; it's truly sad. Wonderful film!! Highly recommend it to anyone married young or old.",The Vow

Rachel McAdams gives great performance, she's definitely born to do these kind of movies, with her innocent face. Channing Tatum is, once again, a great male lead, he has that charisma that will make you watch a movie without blinking. Movie is based on a true events, about a woman named Page who loses her memory after a car accident. Her husband now has to do everything to make her fall in love with him all over again. The movie is perfectly made and has a numerous number of scenes that will make you cry and cause you goosebumps. Who liked The Notebook and Dear John will adore this one. I guarantee you !",The Vow

But I was totally right this movie is awesome just awesome. Maybe people who went to watch it are no the mushy mush type and thats why they gave it a low score. The acting from both parts was great and what makes it even better is that the movie is based upon a true story I recommend it to Every Romantic Person out there. This is a must see movie.

176,lauinger_11,Chick Flick or Just a GOOOD MOVIE!,10,16 February 2012,"When I went to this movie with my fiancé I was thinking it was going to be a complete chick flick and he wouldn't like it. Once it started to play and it had comedy, romance and a little bit of a mystery (who could end up with who) it surprised me! He loved it :) Rachel McAdams plays a wonderful role in this movie, with dealing with the tragedy that had occurred she managed to fight through in character to fix her life. I myself love shows like this such as the notebook, and time traveler's wife, so I was completely stoked. Plus hello Channing Tatum every girl loves seeing him in movies. The movie was really good, I would recommend it to everyone, and after it was over I had noticed that not only were there a lot of girls, there were a lot of guys there too. This movie sure does have its tear jerking moments, but at times it makes you laugh, which I think makes for a good movie. Had it been all drama, or all romance I don't think it would be as good, it's exactly what I expected from the movie I don't think I would really change anything except the ending maybe just add a little more. I loved the way that the music and actors all fit together so well there wasn't any head banging music when it should be sad! The ending could have been better I will admit that, it's hard to watch a movie when the whole thing leaves you breath taking and then you get to the end and you're like ""Wow, really that's it"" it's just not as exciting of a movie when that happens, so I'd change that up a little bit. Overall WONDERFUL movie, very compelling and romantic definitely leaves you wanting more.",The Vow
177,uanna11,The Vow,3,17 February 2012,"""The Vow,"" is inspired by a true and romantic story but to me it's just another cheesy Friday night movie. In the very first shot, two happy young lovebirds, Leo and Paige exit a movie theater, not giving us any ideas. They waste no time getting to the point there a loving couple. As Leo and Paige drive home, they tease, they laugh; they pull over for a little fooling around and get rear-ended by a large truck. Paige loses her memory and never recovers from the accident. From this point in the movie, I actually enjoyed it; it was interesting and kept you questioning what's going to happen. I think those elements from the movie were actually helpful in representing the theme of the whole movie. The past four years, Paige doesn't remember anything such as her husband, why she stopped pursuing her law degree, and why she doesn't talk to her family anymore. To me, The Vow is just an average gooey Valentine's movie that will soon be forgotten as soon as February fourteenth passes. Half way in the movie when she is trying to reminisce with her husband, I continually waited during every little scene for something to happen. They just kept dragging it out which made the movie boring and long to watch. The movie was not the best but the previews did an excellent job in advertising that it would be the next, Notebook or Titanic. What I did like about the movie were the cheesy romantic scenes. ""For example,"" Paige was at work and she saw a box on the table with her name on it. As she is walking toward the box she saw her loving hubby Leo, outside in the rain, saying ""open it."" There was Advil with a note saying, for your head, tissues for her nose, sexy lingerie for him, condom for later, and a picture of him for her heart. The last forty-five minutes are a mind-numbing vacuum, as the various plot contrivances resolve in the way you will not expect, and the movie finds a perfectly soothing path to its inevitable ending.",The Vow
178,no-compromisation,The Vow Summary,10,18 February 2012,"I went to see The Vow today. I heard that Channing Tatum was in it and for the first five minutes of the motion picture I was just trying to determine where that guy was. There was a mysterious fellow named Leo. Then it dawned on me. Channing Tatum is Leo- a hard-working hipster trying to make it in an upscale, attorney's Chicagoan world. Too grandiose? Let me rephrase: Channing Tatum (Leo) isn't a lawyer, but knows some lawyers.Before I get any further, let me just say: Channing Tatum truly brought the house down, but not just the house, also his entire getup (britches right before bed, I always say, and Channing sticks to it! Not just the couch, mind you!).So let's get down to it. Jeremy (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in deep love with a sister. Shame on you! Not his sister! Gwen's sister. Gwen gets married at some point to a normal, white-collar, Frank-Gillo-esque man. But that is not pertinent to Jeremy's story. Jeremy's love interest is named Rachel McAdams in real life, but in the movie her name is Paige (Rachel McAdams). So Paige and Jeremy are gonna get hitched, right? Wrong! Paige decides to become artist and there is no place for art in Jeremy's (Terrence Howard) heart of flesh and blood.This is the point where Paige meets Jeremy's enemy Leo (Channing Tatum). So Leo uses his anti-Jeremy charm and truly wins over Paige. Paige does not know what to do, so she marries Leo and becomes a sculptor who lives in a hipster clan with another couple and Spock from Star Trek. But you know what they say, when Jeremy is involved he'll stay involved. Newly fitted with a resolve to do away with the middle-class tempter (Leo; Tatum), Jeremy gets himself a snow plow truck apparatus and attempts to plow away Leo (Chan). When the tempter and his winnings (Chandler and Rachael) go out for a drive on the town, Jeremy plows right into them with his device. But the plan backfires and he ends up giving Paige's (McAdams) head a bonking it will never forget. Ironically enough, it does forget the bonking, but with it, the entire spell of Leo disappears.Jeremy's mistake works out for the best after all.Back at the Tutterford clan home (Paige Tutterford is the girl we've been discussing), Mr. Tutterford enjoys a nice evening with his wife who almost left him. They soon hear of Jeremy's success and rush to the hospital to take Paige from the clutches of Leo (Tatoom). Leo (Tatester) works his anti-Jer charm again and slowly the tables turn to his favor...he has her once more.But in the end Paige makes out with Jeremy (Tobey Maguire) in Jeremy's headquarters interrupting an important phone call between Jeremy (Regis Philbin) and ""dad"" (King Tutterford). Jeremy (Chairman Mao) can taste success in his blood pumper and feels a fervor not felt since the attack on Leo (Chanderlain).Long story short, Paige (now referred to as ""Jeremy's girl"") divorces the anti-Jeremy.In case it was not clear, Jeremy and Lord Tutterford are lawyers.The end.",The Vow

When she finally comes round she has lost her memory and has no recollection of her perfect life. This turns out to be his worst nightmare cause there is no sign of her ever remembering as the film goes on.

Dwelling upon the mushy, cute and sublime thoughts of lovers...Take a dive into the subconscious of your brain and let the feeling sink in, let the realization dawn. Here we begin with a love story and end with a story about love. It is interesting to note that the movie revolves around the term commitment on very different grounds. This Vow sets you free and gives you space rather than being binding. When two people are in love, there is no promise made with a purpose. It tends to focus on the fact that you should love someone by accepting them for what they are. Love is to be arrived at, no one found love when they went about looking for it, is simply the message given away, in slow motion! Leo terms them as ""moments of impact"", and Paige, simply as ""memories"". Walking away has certainly helped many couples lessen the distance. Find out if it does the same for a happily married couple like Paige and Leo. Inspired from a true story, The Vow has certainly moved beyond the cliché and offers a different take on togetherness. The touch of misguiding emotions is what brings out its true flavour. Just imagine waking up in a hospital, remembering nothing and being told that your temporal lobe isn't functional at the moment. How comfortable would you be with yourself, the world around you? It's rather scary for any normal person to forget years of their life. Petrified Paige basks in the glory of her elite family to discover, betrayal and pretense as she fails to remember anything beyond her high school years. Yes, the real world is cruel and this is probably the only element of reality that takes the movie beyond the reel. Paige sets out on a path of self discovery and in the process director Michael Sucsy has given away a lot in terms of liberation of the self. Just that Rachel McAdams, could have been a little more confused and Channing Tatum, a bit more disturbed, so that you could just about manage to cry. However, people seem much at ease in control of the situation keeping the tension subtle throughout the flick. Sudden outbursts and moments of sweet nothings add some charm to the drama.

My disappointment came in the fact that I read the book before seeing the film, and settled down to watch the true story, only to find it was only 'inspired by a true story'. I feel it lost a lot by not having the spiritual dimension of the true story. God is the one who kept the couple together in the book, and that was the whole essence, and so I found it hard to believe the couple in the film could 'do it on their own'.

184,jdp831,"""Moments of Impact Define Who We Are.""",9,15 November 2012,"The Vow is a romantic movie about the tragedy of a relationship between Paige and Leo after a fateful car accident, which causes Paige to lose her memory of the past five years of her life. The years lost, mainly included the knowledge of her current husband and her life. The love struck couple goes from having a giggly young love, to walking on thin ice. Leo soon realizes that his marriage with his true love is at stake and will stop at nothing to help Paige remember and rekindle their love. The main actors, Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams did a fantastic job of really stepping into the place of their roles. I genuinely believed that I was watching reality. Throughout this movie the director has Leo using personal dialogue at important moments and tuning out every sound that is going on around him. This highlights the major themes and ideas that go along throughout this movie. The car crash in the beginning was a very crucial moment for this movie. In order to capture this moment perfectly, the director filmed the accident in slow motion to emphasize how serious and life threatening this crash was. I really liked how the director played out the breaking point of Leo and Paige's relationship; I was not expecting it to happen the way it did. It broke my heart and made me sympathize with their situation. It was heartbreaking to see how much pain Leo was in to say goodbye to his ""wife."" This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unlike other movies, the events in this movie are not what you would expect. There is suspense, romance, and heartbreak involved with the emotional effect of this movie. This movie will make the audience tap into their true feelings at one point or another, and at times the movie can even bring up memories of past or previous lovers. The Vow is an excellent movie, which fits right along with other popular movies such as; The Notebook, Dear John, The Last Song, and other famous Nicholas Sparks movies. All of these movies contain love stories with a tragedy involved that are well known and loved. Although I was upset and disappointed that Paige never regained her memory and didn't officially get back together with Leo in the movie, I was glad that the ending was not a predictable one. However, the ending did hint that Paige and Leo were going to ""start over"" and try again. The Vow is a romantic movie with an unexpected yet fitting ending. This movie is an overpowering example of true love and the deep connection two people feel for one another, despite obstacles that come in their paths.",The Vow

The scene where Leo had tried flirting for a date with Paige was pictured in a very sweet and simple way. That was the base plot for the couple to have the story begin. It also showed the emotional side of a lover when Paige was not able to recollect her old memories and relationship with Leo and Leo in spite of putting all his efforts to bring back Paige's memory was in a kind of devastation.

I was absolutely disgusted with Hollywood's attempt to re-create a true Christian love story. They didn't even try to incorporate God into it all and He was the only reason that the Carpenters stayed together. On top of Hollywood doing a poor job of showing the truth of their lives, they also do a terrible job of showing much emotion thru the movie. In the book you could tell that the Carpenters truly loved each other and showed the struggle it was to continue on with the life they now shared. The movie showed none of this. It was a cheap imitation of the Christian love they shared. If I could give this movie a 0, I would. It was absolutely, 100% awful! Read the book if you want the true story!

189,rmicozz-931-682008,Cute Romantic Movie,8,23 February 2014,"Michael Sucsy's 2012 romance, The Vow, begins with a young, married Chicago couple leaving a movie theater on a snowy night. A car accident sends Paige, the wife, into a coma, and when she emerges she has amnesia in which she cannot remember the last five years of her life. She has reverted to a previous version of herself. As Paige goes on an emotional journey to find herself, her husband, Leo, tries to win her heart over again. The romance is not a traditional or cliché love story about wondering if the couple will get married, but instead it is a story about commitment, and their vows they made to each other on their wedding day. The Vow (Sucsy 2012) is an exceptionally respectable love tale because of the renowned leading actress Rachel McAdams, the charming male lead Channing Tatum, and the physical appearances of the supporting actor Scott Speedman, but because of the chosen set design the romance is not as powerful as it could have been. By picking Rachel McAdams to play the lead role in The Vow (Sucsy 2012), director Sucsy made the right decision. McAdams is extremely well known for the roles she plays in romances including The Notebook (Cassavetes 2004), About Time (Curtis 2013), The Time Traveler's Wife (Schwentke 2009), and Midnight in Paris (Allen 2011). She takes on the role of a female lover fairly well and always has chemistry with her co-male star. McAdams fulfills the part of Paige, who is on an emotional journey trying to find her true identity. She does a phenomenal job of convincing the audience of the loving, distressful, overwhelming, and confusing feelings her character is feeling as she re-engages with her estranged family, revisits her love for her ex- fiancé, and tries to determine why she ever left law school. McAdams, with her stunning smile, lures the audience in because of her well-known roles in love tales. Another well-known star that takes on the lead role of Leo is Channing Tatum who is very enticing and makes the perspective audience interested in viewing The Vow (Sucsy 2012). Tatum is a heartthrob because of his amazingly good looks and fit body, and he too can be associated with love tales as he took on the male lover in Dear John (Hallström 2010). ""He is quite convincing as the loving husband who does everything he can to resettle his wife into their loving routine"" (Urban). Leo tries everything in his power to try to make Paige fall in love with him again including doing things such as reminding her she is a vegetarian, showing her the forgotten studio, taking her to their favorite date spot, taking their monthly swim in Lake Michigan, and tickling her to jog her memory. He does all of these tedious and frustrating tasks because he is madly in love with her and because of the vows he made on their wedding day. Tatum clearly displays that his character is not going to give up that easily. Channing Tatum plays the committed and loving husband that every woman desires and every man strives to become for his significant other.Scott Speedman plays the supporting role of Paige's ex-fiancé, Jeremy. After waking up from the accident all Paige remembers is being engaged to Jeremy. He is still in love with Paige, and is so thrilled she has come back to him after she left him five years prior. Jeremy decided to dump his current girlfriend in hopes of getting back with Paige. From some angles he looks Wile E. Coyote, but from straight on he looks friendly and handsome. Although he is not necessarily a bad guy, he uses Paige's accident to try to rewrite the past (Ebert). The director definitely chose the right star for this role because his looks are equivalent to his character, he is up to no good like Wile E. Coyote, but he is masking it with his friendly, handsome side. This makes the audience feel sympathetic for Leo because he is honest about his love for Paige, whereas Jeremy is using her accident to his advantage to try to win her over. The choice of the supporting character for Paige's ex-fiancé helps the plot of the story by making the audience emotionally side with Leo, hoping for him to receive Paige's love. The Vow (Sucsy 2012) is filmed in Toronto, Canada, excluding the scene of the newlywed running through Millennium Park in Chicago. The movie is set in Chicago, and although there are various clips of the skyline and trains themselves, ""the couple itself is rarely seen in them"" (Ebert). This does not make the setting of the movie believable since the couple is only seen in Chicago once. This is not a large part of the movie, therefore is does not effect the storyline greatly. It would have been nice for the audience to see more the couple in the city around some of the notable landmarks of Chicago. The Vow (Sucsy 2012) is a recommended romance film because of the love shared between the lead roles and the selection of the supporting ex-fiancé role, but by actually filming in Chicago the setting would have been more credible. The inspiring true events make this movie tug at the heartstrings of its viewers, hoping that Paige will eventually love Leo as passionately as he loves her. The Vow (Sucsy 2012) also demonstrates that couples should never give up on each other even in the toughest of times. This outstanding and encouraging romance is a must see for couples of all ages.

191,Indiajolly-175-308695,Outstanding Movie!,9,17 December 2014,"In this romantic drama Channing Tatum plays Leo, and Rachel McAdams plays his wife Paige. The couple gets into a car accident and Paige suffers amnesia. Many people who reviewed this movie are saying this is just the basic ""chick flick"", but why does that matter? In my opinion there is nothing wrong with these so called ""chick flicks"". People always find romantic movies predicting and boring. I personally like some predictable movies. To me movies like this are kind of like living your own fairytale throughout other people's lives. The fact that this movie was based on a true story made it even better to me. This movie uses drama and acting to keep your attention. Some reviewers argue that there is not good chemistry between the actors but a lot disagree. I think that there was great chemistry between these two actors. When it flashes back and shows how the two of them met is a great place they show chemistry. You can tell that they are having a great time in this flash back, and it really gives you an idea of when they started to fall in love. I think that Channing and Rachel did a great job with this.The other thing that I have seen people comment on is the emotion, and how it lacked in both of the main actors. I think that Rachel McAdams has done a great job in this movie with her emotion, just like in the Notebook. It would be hard if you woke up, and did not remember anything going on in your life. I think she was very convincing with her acting and emotion. She did a great job showing the struggle it would be to deal with all of it. Rachel's facial expressions and the emotion she puts behind her acting makes you feel like she is actually the one going through all of this. Channing Tatum also does a great job with his emotion, and not giving up no matter what it took to win her back. After being turned down time and time again he never gives up. Not to mention how he shows how hurt he was with this terrible tragedy. He convinces me with the love he shows for Paige with his determination and sincerity.However, I do agree there are a few parts of the movie that could have been better. For instance, the scene with the car accident could have been made a little more believable. I felt that it looked really fake. The way that they accident happened did not really make it that believable to me. Also, the way that Paige got so hurt looked very unrealistic when happening. This scene was in slow motion, which I think usually adds to the affect; however, I think that it seemed to hurt it this time. I think that camera angle could have also been changed at the end. At the beginning it was close up and at the end it was more of an overview. I think that when it was close up it seemed more realistic, because it felt more like you were there. The last thing I wish would have been changed was the ending would have been a little different, but it still worked for me. Even with these little things I still loved this movie. Overall, I thought this was a great movie. From the beginning of where it shows the car accident, and how they met, to the end, it kept my attention. I loved the plot, acting, and the fight for love. This is one of my all time favorites. The true story behind it all with all of the emotion put into the acting was outstanding. This ""chick flick"" earns a high rating in my opinion.",The Vow
192,khart-15185,Disappointed,6,13 March 2015,"Just watched this movie for the first time. Overall a good movie. Didn't quite like the ending. I understand it was based on a true story but it is a movie so it could be just a little different in order to pull a bigger audience. Extremely disappointed that Paige didn't recover her memory. I was waiting for that spontaneous moment that she suddenly remembered everything and came running back to Leo. Not a movie that I would watch for a second or third time. Overall I think this movie lacked drama and character. For instance why was it suck a big deal that her father cheated. Yes I understand the pain but to stop speaking to your entire family for five years when it wasn't anyone's fault but your fathers. Could have been written a little better. But like I said it is a true story, but things could have been twisted up a little just for the purpose to pull a little more attention and drama to the plate.",The Vow

Then the world comes crashing down and it's heart-wrenching. I loved it and hated it all at the same time. I kept wishing she would be more understanding and willing to try. Leo (Channing Tatum) was working so hard and being so patient, but she would get flustered and stamp her foot and run away. It was frustrating to watch Paige (Rachel McAdams) turn him away and try to go back to her old life, something comfortable. She didn't seem to listen to the doctor and try to regain her memory. She was afraid of her life and the unknown. I was glad that it ended with them starting again, but after all that she put him through, I was angry with it. The ending wasn't enough. It left me wanting more. I wanted a scene or to at the end to jump ahead in time and show them together. Granted, it shows a picture of the real couple with two kids, but it wasn't enough. I rate it a 7/10 because it was a good enough movie with excellent actors to bring out all these emotions in me. I was able to feel the happiness and anger and sadness that you should be able to feel while watching any movie. It was excellent and terrible all in one. Excellent because the story was wonderfully handled. Terrible because the story was frustrating.",The Vow
194,sadiemay-59142,"A ""Hopeless Romantics"" Dream",9,4 October 2016,"Imagine a sad love story. The husband loses his wife of seventy-plus years to cancer or a wife becomes a widow after her husband is killed in war. These are stories that might have come to mind. And notice they have a very similar theme—losing a loved one. Most sad love stories carry this same theme, but what about a love story that has that same theme, but in a different way? What if, for example, the husband doesn't lose his wife physically, but instead loses her mentally and emotionally? This is the idea behind Michael Sucsy's movie ""The Vow."" When a couple from Chicago are in an accident that causes Paige (Rachel McAdams) to forget her life with Leo (Channing Tatum), we are caught in this emotional roller-coaster as Leo tries to get his wife to fall in love with him again. The amount of emotion this movie inflicts on its viewers is what makes it a ""hopeless romantics"" dream. Almost every scene causes some kind of emotion to be felt by the audience—whether it's anger, sadness, or even love. The actors take partial credit for making this movie so emotionally provoking. First, is the way actors react to each other. They really make the audience believe they are in love—or upset with each other. Whether it's Tatum's shy smile to something McAdams says, the way McAdams gazes into Tatum's eyes, or the hurt in Tatum's face when McAdams doesn't recognize him. Every interaction between the two actors seems real—which helps make the movie come to life. Secondly, is how the actors play their own roles to a tea. McAdams does a great job playing the ""confused girl"" role. From her facial expressions to the believable uncertainty in her voice to the way she stands—her arms crossed in an insecure and scared way. Tatum also does a wonderful job playing the loving and needy husband by, for example, how he speaks softer when he's talking to McAdams. The impeccable acting is what helps viewers feel a part of the movie. The actors make the emotions feel so believable that the viewers take on the same emotions themselves. One of the most important aspects of the movie, though, is how the plot is arranged. The movies' beginning sets up an immediate emotional connection to Leo and Paige. People fall in love with the couple within the first few minutes of the movie and then are crushed when the tragic accident happens. This connection forces viewers to stay engaged in the movie to see what happens next to their favorite couple. The plot also keeps an important detail ""hidden"" throughout the movie until the end, which allows for a sense of surprise for viewers when they finally find out what has happened. This movie is probably not meant for everyone. Some people are not ""hopeless romantics."" Yet, this movie gives its viewers the opportunity to see a concept that is so widely known and yet is so rarely believed: ""love conquers all."" It's hard to watch this movie and NOT feel a connection to it. Viewers will want to dive right in and feel what the characters feel and see what the characters see. People will root for the good guy (Leo), boo the bad guy (Jeremy), and sometimes they will want to punch Paige in the face. They might cry, they will definitely laugh, and if at some point they don't get a little ""love"" feeling from the movie, there's something wrong with them.",The Vow

This movie is so beautiful, and iconic about how love should be regardless of how horrible the circumstances are. P.S thanks for searchin me up <3",The Vow
196,yeti-96077,"First Comes Love, Then Comes Marriage, Then It Is All Erased",8,3 April 2017,"""I vow to help you love life, to always hold you with tenderness, and to have the patience that love demands,""— these are the vows promptly forgotten by a new bride following a tragic car accident. The Vow is everything you would expect from a typical Hollywood romance: eye- candy actors, devastating amnesia, and the art of rediscovering love. Like all sappy love stories, the couple finds themselves in love at first-sight. As expected, it is not long before they have an adorable, spur-of-the-moment wedding in an art gallery. When a devastating car accident leaves star actress, Rachel McAdams, with no memory of her husband, the story begins to unfold in an overtly obvious way. By this time, we all know the rest of the film is going to feature the sculpted Channing Tatum winning his oblivious wife's love all-over again. This film— although falling nowhere short of typical—will undoubtedly tug at a few of your heart strings. With confidence, I can advise all my fellow ladies to grab some tissues to accompany the many tear jerking moments scattered throughout the plot. The story of The Vow seems exceptionally more poignant when it is presented as the sincere, true-story it is based off. In the light of modern cinema having a trend towards violence and negativity, I appreciate the value of a heart-warming sappy love story on occasion; it is the perfect film to be accompanied by a rainy day, a cozy blanket, and a steamy cup of coffee.",The Vow
