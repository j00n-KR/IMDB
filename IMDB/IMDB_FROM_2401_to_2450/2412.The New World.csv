0,TheLittleSongbird,"Perhaps my least favourite Malick, but still very good",8,10 July 2011,"I can understand again why those mayn't like Terrence Malick and his films, and this film too. I am not one of those people though, I highly appreciate Malick and his films too.The New World is probably my least favourite of his work, but that doesn't mean bad, just that I enjoyed his other films more. The slow pace didn't bother me, I think it was deliberate and also a characteristic of Malick, however I do think some scenes do drag and the story while often poetic and poignant is not always as involving as I would've liked.However, Malick's direction once again is spot on, the music is beautiful and haunting and the photography and images/scenery are astounding. The dialogue is fine and effort is gone into making the audience care for the characters particularly with Pocahontas. The acting I have no problem with either, the lady who plays Pocahontas is very compelling and moving and holds her own against Colin Farell and Christian Bale, both excellent.All in all, very good but perhaps my least favourite of Malick's work. 8/10 Bethany Cox",The New World
1,Leofwine_draca,"Dull with Farrell, decent without him",5,3 September 2016,"2005's THE NEW WORLD – a retelling of the Pocahontas story – has all the trappings of a masterpiece, sharing the evocative score and magnificent camera-work of Terrence Malick's previous film, THE THIN RED LINE. Unfortunately it's a flawed masterpiece, one that suffers from the director's penchant for long scenes that verge on boredom, as characters wander in the forests and communicate without dialogue. An hour could have easily been cut from the beginning of this film to make it better paced but we're left with moments of emptiness that test the viewer's patience.The good news is that, once Colin Farrell is out of the way, the film picks up pace and gets on with telling the actual story. In this respect the last hour of the film is by far the best. And speaking of Farrell, it's fair to say that he's definitely the worst thing in the movie; his Irish accent recurs throughout the film despite his best efforts to disguise it, and he fails to invest his character with any kind of depth. Even worse, no effort is made to hide his tattoos, which the English didn't wear until the mid-18th century. Far better is Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas; she's lovely and her spirited character is a delight. There are many supporting actors who put in VERY good performances – particularly Christian Bale, as brilliant as ever, and a little-seen Christopher Plummer as the ship's captain.The film does well to put across a feeling of how life was for both the Native Americans and the settlers and the authenticity never comes into question. But action fans will be disappointed in the lack of battle – the one we do see is over and done with as quick as you like, and Malick is more interested in shooting the trees. Things end on a high with a particularly poignant and moving climax, and it's a shame the rest of the film never reaches this level. When Farrell's on screen, it's pretty dull; when he's off it, it's pretty decent.",The New World
2,SnoopyStyle,slow dreamy beauty,7,26 July 2016,"It's 1607. John Smith (Colin Farrell) arrives in the new world in chains. Captain Christopher Newport establishes the Jamestown, Virginia settlement. He pardons John Smith and puts him in charge of an expedition. With rising tension, John is taken prisoner by the natives. Pocahontas is the favorite of Chief Powhatan. She saves John's life and he becomes a part of the community. He is released back to the settlement to find starvation and death stalking the remaining settlers. They are saved by Pocahontas. Powhatan banishes her and orders an attack when the English won't leave.Terrence Malick has mastered the slow dreamy beautiful visual style. He makes the native world an idyllic paradise. The English world is the one with a foreboding menace. The dreamy mood works well for the native civilization. The action also works well with surprisingly scary quick native warriors. The English world feels disjointed. The story is told in snippets. Malick is much more interested in the dreamlike mood. It doesn't have the intensity and urgency of the story which leads me to wonder if a fictional story would be better. In that way, accuracy and specificity would not matter quite as much. Pocahontas in the English world is not as compelling as John Smith in the native world. Q'orianka Kilcher is an intriguing new actress. She's able to maintain interest throughout.",The New World
3,claudio_carvalho,An Epic Romance,7,7 February 2007,"In the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, along the English colonization of North America, Captain John Smith (Collin Farrell) leaves the Jamestown fort to explore another area and trade with the Indians, but he is captured. The princess Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) asks her father to spare Captain Smith's life and they fall in love for each other. When he returns to the colony, he becomes the president of Jamestown and finds people starving, but Pocahontas brings supplies, saves them and falls in disgrace with her people. When the Indians realize that the English will not leave their country, they attack and after a bloody battle, the English trade Pocahontas and lodge her in the fort to protect their families, and Captain Smith loses his position because he does not agree with the arrangement. With the return of Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer), Captain Smith is promoted and sent back to England, and he asks a friend to tell Pocahontas that he drowned along the trip. Pocahontas is civilized and baptized by the English and John Rolfe (Christian Bale) proposes and marries her. Many years later, she hears that Captain Smith is alive, and she has to decide if she keeps her marriage or follows her heart.""The New World"" is an epic romance with a wonderful cinematography and soundtrack, but the low paced story is too cold in its narrative. Terrence Malick, as usual, builds the complex characters with many existential problems, leaving the passion and flame of love aside. I liked this beautiful adult version of ""Pocahontas"", but I did not feel any emotion in the end of the story. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil: ""O Novo Mundo"" (""The New World"")",The New World
4,kosmasp,Otherworldly,7,20 April 2007,"A new world indeed and a new Terence Malick picture (at least his most recent complete one). It is a very spiritual movie and it is moving at a really slow pace. Even a turtle and/or a snail would be offended by the pacing. Seriously though, you have to let yourself relax and breathe ... like the movie does.The newcomer Q'orianka who plays the main role here is great! She came to Berlin with the rest of the cast, to celebrate the movie at the Berline International Film Festival ... while she also had her birthday (she got 16 in 2006) and you never would've guessed it ... Women always seem more mature ... in fact they are ;o) Anyway her performance elevates the movie, although it is awfully difficult to feel empathy for any other character portrayed in the movie (it's obvious that it's the intention of Malick to give them flaws), that's why I didn't like this movie as much as I have previous Malick films (not that there are many mind you! ;o) If you can cope with the pace and the more than human characters, than you should watch this drama ...",The New World
5,gavin6942,What You Would Expect From Malick,6,16 June 2017,"The story of the English exploration of Virginia, and of the changing world and loves of Pocahontas.There are, of course, historical issues with this film. Most scholars agree that there was no romantic relationship between Pocahontas and Smith. She would have been 10 years old in 1608 when they were said to have first met. So the whole premise is flawed. But in other areas, such as the attempt to have a native language spoken, some credit ought to be given.Ultimately, I found the film to be good but somewhat trying. Malick is a strange director. Obviously talented, but he lets his artistic vision go unchecked. And then it starts feeling pretentious. Other directors could be accused of similar issues (David Lynch?), and I suppose it really comes down to artistic preference. My preference does not jibe with Malick, it seems.",The New World
6,lee_eisenberg,"too long, too slow",3,5 September 2006,"After Disney's ridiculous ""Pocahontas"", it seemed like any movie about that story would be an improvement. Too bad that the improvement was barely one notch better. ""The New World"" could have been at least half an hour shorter. Much of it consists of meaningless dialogue, and spends most of the time plodding. It's apparent historical accuracy can't save it, as it comes out boring. There have been much better movies about contact between Europeans and Indians (namely ""The Mission""), so there's no reason to waste your time on this.I hate to have to say this, but from the two Terrence Malick movies that I've seen - this one and ""The Thin Red Line"" - he's not showing himself to be one of the world's greatest directors. Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, Wes Studi and David Thewlis are probably pretty embarrassed about this.By the way, have you ever noticed how it sounds if you remove the ""n"" from Pocahontas?",The New World
7,ccthemovieman-1,"In This Case, It Pays To Know In Advance",8,15 May 2006,"Be prepared.That's the best advice I could tell anyone who is thinking of watching this film. If you know what you are going to see, in this case, you'll be better off because if you are expecting an action-packed historical adventure story, you will be bitterly disappointed.This is s-l-o-w moving, very slow, and fairly long at two hours and 15 minutes. If you realize that and don't care you might really enjoy this movie. If you enjoyed ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring,"" you'll like this. Those two films are similar in beauty and pace.If you love good visuals, which I do, then this is a DVD you want to view. Terrence Malick has directed only four movies in 33 years and all four are beautifully filmed, the best being the second: ""Days Of Heaven."" I would rank this second to that film in terms of beauty.Cinematography-wise, there is a lot to like in The New World, especially the scenes on the water, which are magnificent. I wish there more of them. What we see is Jamestown, Va., in the year 1607, so this film is about as rural as you're ever going to see America. It's the story of Pocahontas (although she's never called that in the movie) and her relationship to two men: John Smith (Colin Farrell) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher plays the Indian girl who is given the Christian name ""Rebecca"" later in the film and this woman is mesmerizing throughout. What an innocently-interesting face!Of the three leads, the shocker is Farrell, who is very low-key, rarely says much and is almost strange in his behavior. If you've seen him as the obnoxious and profane public-relations sleaze in ""Phone Booth,"" then picture the opposite, and that's him in this. Unfortunately, I had just watched ""Phone Booth"" last week so seeing Farrell in this role was bad timing for me. He just didn't fit! However, Kilcher and Bale are fantastic and people you really root for to wind up happy.Without giving it away, the ending haunted me for a few days afterward. In the end, it is a powerful story, not just scene after scene of gorgeous photography (which it also is). There is more to this movie than the camera-work, but there is no doubt the cinematography is sitll the main attraction.",The New World
8,rmax304823,Death and transfiguration.,8,2 October 2007,"This pretty authentic reconstruction of the loves of Pocahontas in the first English colony in the New World, North Carolina, to be exact, is like most of Terence Malick's movies, deliriously slow, suffused with natural beauty, and voiced over with poetic narrative comments that touch only lightly on the scenes we witness.Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) helps establish the colony in 1607, meets the teen aged Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), they fall for each other, and then Smith departs for England. Word reaches the colony that he died on the passage. She lives with the English now, going about her chores in a daze, but attracts the widower Guy Rolfe (Christian Bales), who talks her into marriage, has a child with her, and takes her to England with him. She learns that John Smith is still alive and Rolfe frees her to be with Smith. When they meet again, however, she realizes that so much time has past, about 8 years, that she has come to love Rolfe and she returns to him. Pocahontas is introduced to the King and Queen. She dies on the outward passage to the New World, happy enough to leave the future to her son.So far, it sounds like a soap opera and in a way it is, but Malick makes it more than that. There are battles, for instance, between the colonists and the Indians of Powhatan's tribe. (I don't see any reason to call them Native Americans because I've lived with several tribes and they invariably referred to themselves as ""Indians"" when speaking English.) It's also a commentary on cultural dominance, though Malick doesn't hit us over the head with it. The location shooting is splendid. Compared to this, Ingmar Bergman's ""Scenes From a Marriage"", is very slow indeed.Malick has wisely cast a young woman as Pocahontas who is half Peruvian and half Swiss and who is not a raving knockout, which is the usual tactic. Q'oreanka Kilcher has delicate, feline eyes, a bulky nose, and sensuous lips. I mention this because Malick spends a lot of film time on close ups of her, and it's all to the good. By the end of the film we've come to know her, and she's come to have a wistful beauty that belongs to her and not to Hollywood convention. Malick also seems to believe the audience is mature enough to do without any politically correct attributions of supernal spirituality to the Indians. They're doing okay, and that's good enough. They have a sense of humor and are pretty relaxed about things that have the Englishmen quaking in their boots. But neither do they go out of their way to avoid battles.Malick is an interesting director. His first film, ""Badlands,"" was in its own quiet way masterful. The next one, though exhibiting some gorgeous scenery, didn't do well. And ""The Thin Red Line"" had the misfortune of being released at the same time as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" which was released under the aegis of Steven Spielberg. ""Private Ryan"" was an award-winning blockbuster and comparisons with Malick's more subdued, less commercial meditation on Guadalcanal were pointless.This is really well worth seeing.",The New World
9,moonspinner55,A masterful achievement from a technical and artistic standpoint,4,17 May 2011,"Writer-director Terrence Malick's depiction of 17th century British expedition to found new colony in Jamestown, Virginia is a masterful achievement from a technical and artistic standpoint...yet, it is so low-keyed that it rarely comes to life. This is the work of a great cinematic auteur, but one exits ""The New World"" (particularly in its mammoth, 172-minute ""extended version"") feeling unmoved. As depicted, the expedition isn't heightened in excitement with bold characterizations or rousing action; the filmmaker keeps the scenario in check, preferring to let the narrative unfold carefully (some may argue too cautiously). This is an intellectual's version of a history lesson, and some viewers may be put off by the slow pace. Colin Ferrell (heavily bearded--and with alert but haunted eyes) portrays Captain John Smith, who becomes a doomed prisoner of the Natives before having his life spared by the chief's doe-eyed daughter, Pocahontas. Their love affair verges dangerously close to Blue Lagoon territory (lots of chaste, bare shoulder-rubbing and half-kisses in montage), though Malick shows a surprising vulnerability in these instances (he displays the dawning of new and tremulous emotions with a kind of naked purity). The mutiny which ensues between the British and the ""savages"" is brutal and hard-hitting; however, the human drama at the heart of the picture seems stretched out too long. Malick doesn't tiptoe through the tangled relationships, but his focus does tend to stray. Christian Bale's role as smitten new settler John Rolfe is flattened as a result; he never takes on any dimension. Rolfe is an unenviable romantic substitute for an absentee Smith, and when he and Pocahontas go through the whole courting thing all over again, it just feels like a repeat. As an artistic and visceral achievement, ""The New World"" is vivid, brooding and intense. As an entertainment, per se, it lacks an inner fire that is necessary to envelop a wide audience. Malick isn't indifferent to the people on-screen, but one gets the impression he's far more interested in the erotic, swirling waters, the crackling lightning in the cloudy skies, and the forms and figures of the muscular Native Americans as seen in silhouette or by firelight. Do the central characters become important and real to us? Not very. ** from ****",The New World
10,Quinoa1984,"there might be a great film in here somewhere, but I just didn't see it as much as others have",8,13 February 2006,"Terence Malick's The New World is something that I really did want to find to be the brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing visual masterpiece that some have been calling it (apparently though it is one of the most audience divided films of 2005 for those who have seen it). In a couple of ways it is unique- Malick takes on the history of this time and puts his visual look onto the era, and wants to say to the audience through his form of poetry/philosophy 'come, look at all this, the lands, the rivers, the Native people soon to be tainted by the West'. In a way he tries to treat the period piece much like Kubrick did with some of his films. But the problem then comes, how do you really draw a viewer into the story? Kubrick could do this because there was something intriguing and involving about the characters, with the pace corresponding with the emotional pull. Malick, however, loses sight of the narrative at times, at least to me. If the film is more about the journey than the destination, too often the film finds itself looking for a narrative pull, and as the story does move along, it's done so in a muddled way through narration that either works OK for some parts, and in others is totally unnecessary. It's like the filmmaker has a definite passion for the period, and for these near icon characters of American history, and yet is too wrapped up in visuals to correspond with the dialog.Colin Farrell's performance in the New World, Terence Malick's fourth film, is one of the better parts of the picture, as well as the performances from Christian Bale and first-timer Q'Orianka Kilcher. At the same time there is a kind of strange quality to their performances, they're also observant, subdued, and trying to get their own grasp of the material, and for the most part it works. Kilcher in particular gives off something here that is both touching and maybe, in a way, off-putting. I liked a lot how she would not be too over-emotional in scenes that could go terribly wrong with first-time actors, though at the same time she could also be quite aloof in certain scenes, and maybe a little one-tone. But maybe that is what Malick was looking for, more of the 'presence' of these actors in these roles than the actual full-on strengths. It becomes one of the interesting points in this film that acting out such textbook/museum people like John Smith, John Rolfe, and Pocahontas, becomes as much of a challenge to take in as the rest of the picture.This review, I suppose, may be rather subjective, though in a way that is almost a compliment to Malick. This is a work of a true auteur, who does side-step the possible pit-falls of a mainstream Hollywood director, and makes the film he wants to on his terms. If it was just a silent film, for example, I might be even more fascinated in what occurs. But unlike my favorite work of his, Badlands, there is a distance put between the audience and characters that isn't achieved so well. Maybe I'll respond to it more on a repeat viewing, as some films often need. But one time in the theater was enough for me.",The New World
11,edwagreen,"If this is New, Give Me the Old World 0*",1,16 August 2006,"Very boring film which is conducive for sleeping. You will not need the sleeping pills after seeing this one.The story could have been told in about 20 minutes about colonization in Jamestown in 1607.The stereotyping is there as the natives are with painted faces, aggressive behavior and the women are practically in the nude.Colin Farrell is a renegade who escapes death from leader Christopher Plummer. The latter soon returns to England to get supplies. How lucky he is to get away from this dull picture.It is told in narrator like setting. Even the battle scenes seem contrived.Enter Christian Bale. The head of the tribe has fallen for Farrell, but thinking he is no longer here, goes with Bale, a widower.

12,wes-connors,The Antidote for No Doze,4,13 December 2009,"In 1607 Virginia, handsome Captain Colin Farrell (as John Smith) arrives in ""The New World"" of America and discovers nubile Native American beauty Q'orianka Kilcher (as Pocahontas aka Rebecca). The clearly aroused duo fall in love, despite great culture and age differences. Filmmakers do portray ""Pocahontas"" as underage; and, sexual relations are ""tastefully"" implied rather than explicitly shown. Though, love blooms for the legendary duo, fate plans otherwise; and, handsome Christian Bale takes over.This is a very beautiful film, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki lushly realizing director Terrence Malick's vision. The Native Americans were most interesting. The English call them ""Naturals"" instead of ""Indians"", and they receive a more flattering portrayal than in decades past. The scenery is gorgeous, but the story is too dreamy - it all has an hypnotic, sleep-inducing effect. Don't watch ""The New World"" after dinner without having a very strong cup of coffee.

13,michaelRokeefe,"New world, new discovery, new love.",6,24 June 2006,"Acclaimed filmmaker Terrence Malick transforms a classic historical story into a saga of discovery, exploration, love and love lost. The British arrives founding the Jamestown Settlement in 1607 with Capt. John Smith(Collin Farrell) in chains. The Native Americans are in wonderment when they first set eyes on the newcomers and needless to say the encounter is one of apprehension and some distrust for all.

A love affair between the two picks up momentum until Smith is sent to sail in search for the West Indies. Pochahontas slowly becomes Americanized all-the-while heartbroken by her lover's absence.

14,jotix100,Colonialism,8,2 October 2006,"Terrence Malick is not a prolific director, as shown by his meager body of work for a man that has spent more than thirty years in the business with only five films to his credit. Yet, every picture he directs is received by his fans with open arms because Mr. Malick has clearly shown his films are a feast for the eyes.The director and his cinematographer the magnificent Emmanuel Lubezki, have created a work of art, a feast for one's eyes. Most of the frames of the movie can stand alone as a picture in a gallery, or a museum. Mr. Malick's work has always distinguished itself for imbuing beauty in everything he shows on the screen. In Mr. Lubezki, the director has found an invaluable collaborator indeed. Both men seem to be attuned into nature as they bring it to us in all its splendor.As far as the film, itself, it's a movie that will divide fans and detractors of Mr. Malick. Our only problem with the film seems to be with the sound quality of the finished product. Watching it in DVD format, the dialog seems to get lost and nuances go by without we being able to catch some of it.""The New World"" represents a discovery by the English explorers of a new land, but it also is an event for the native people whose land, and their way of living will be supplanted by the powerful invaders who will dominate them because of the superiority of their arms. It is sad to realize the arriving white man had no use for the people they find in the new country.The acting in general is first rate. Colin Farrell, as Captain Smith, dominates the first part of the movie. His involvement with the Indian princess Pocahontas, who is never named in the film, shows some tender moments. Q'Orianka Kilcher makes a fine Pocahontas. Christian Bale makes a great appearance as the kind John Rolfe. Christopher Plummer and August Schellenberg are fine as Capt. Newport and Powhatan.Terrence Malick uses James Horner's musical score to blend with Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23, and Richard Wagner's ""Das Rheingold"". The music enhances the mood of the fine images in the film.

15,Doylenf,Gorgeous but empty canvas of primitive art...,6,9 May 2006,"It's incredible to think what a great movie this could have been if as much attention was paid to giving us a literate script as was paid to reconstructing history with villages, Indians, battles, and sets that look like the real thing. The photography is breath-taking throughout, the acting is sincere, but the pace of the film is beyond slow as it recounts a vision of what is said to have happened when the colonists came to form America's Jamestown side by side with some savages who owned the land.The John Smith/Pocahontas theme is nicely handled although all of this kind of story was handled in much more robust fashion by Disney's crew a few years ago when they did their animated version of the tale. And it was a might more entertaining than the way it is recounted here.There is a wistful quality to the whole story and gorgeous landscapes to gape at, authentic sunsets with boats in full sail, and some very convincing looking battle scenes with Indians in full mode as painted savages. Nothing has been spared to give the look of the film authenticity and detailed realism.But as entertainment, it falls far short of the mark. A huge part of the problem is a dull script with Colin Farrell given no opportunity to develop his role as John Smith and Christian Slater reduced to a secondary supporting role as John Rolfe, as is Christopher Plummer.James Horner's music sounds appropriate enough although it is strangely silent at times when some emotional depth could have been aided by his score.Summing up: Deserves credit for being an ambitious project, but ends up being a gorgeous empty canvas of primitive art with limited appeal to students of American history.",The New World

Softly spoken words and a soft, naturally lit landscape of beautiful images and whispering tones. This movie is not for everyone. In the hyper-kinetic modern movie world of extreme editing, shaky cameras, and bombastic action this one is an antithesis. This is a mood piece, of the earliest of Americana, at least from the perspective of the new invaders to the New World. The Naturals have been here for a while and it shows. As does the lack of humility and humanity for most of the guest Imperialists.The movie has enough authenticity shown through some attractive and painful experiences to keep ones attention from wandering into the fields of grass, but impatient viewers and attention span deficits may want to avoid this experiment in what one could call a post-modern alternative to the status-quo state of Hollywood.",The New World
17,Bunuel1976,"THE NEW WORLD {General Release Version} (Terrence Malick, 2005) ***",7,2 June 2006,"Few directors can film nature the way Terrence Malick can which, coupled with James Horner's mysterious yet evocative score, make this epic feel closer to Werner Herzog's AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD (1973) than THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (1992) - to make it has been compared. Besides, the weird ritual scenes when Colin Farrell is first captured by the natives, seem to have strayed in from APOCALYPSE NOW (1979)!! However, impressive visuals - including the appropriately savage battle scenes - aren't enough to offset the general pretentiousness - which also affected Malick's previous effort, THE THIN RED LINE (1998) - that results from the relentless voice-over (which becomes alienating after a while, and is usually muffled to boot!) and especially its disorientating fragmentary style (which does no favors to individual characterization or the sweeping narrative, and is filled with inexplicable jump-cuts!).Q'Orianka Kilcher comes off best from the large cast, since she appears throughout the entire film - whereas Farrell more or less vanishes during the last third to make way for Christian Bale. Christopher Plummer is commanding in his brief but pivotal role, but David Thewlis is wasted as a sneering villain - while John Savage's role as a demented priest and that of Jonathan Pryce as King James I barely register! THE NEW WORLD originally premiered in a 150-minute cut (the General Release Version loses some 15 minutes), which only played for one week in selected theatres in the U.S. Ironically, this happened when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year and, had I known it would have been re-edited, I'd have made my utmost to catch this alternate edit of the film before it disappeared, perhaps forever!",The New World
18,george.schmidt,"Beguiling ""New World"" from a masterful Malick",8,23 January 2006,"THE NEW WORLD (2005) *** Colin Farrell, Q'Orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale. Wes Studi, Noah Taylor, David Thewlis. Beguiling ""New World"" from a masterful MalickFilmmaker Terrence Malick may have only given us three previous films in twenty-five years but his skill has not diminished in his fourth big screen mini- epic about the colonization of America in the 17th century with a beguiling bold look and an unerring eye in capturing natural beauty.Depicting the somewhat mythic lore of first European settlements of Captain John Smith and his romantic rendezvous with the Native American squaw Pocahontas has been told and re-told throughout generations but never before has there been the scent of ambiguity and awkwardness then now. Smith (a somewhat subdued Farrell) and his gaggle of men arrive to the new alien landscape of wooded climes and the indigenous peoples slowly come about to make their presence known as they greet the foreigners at first gingerly and eventually with trepidation and finally brutality. Along the way Smith, originally earmarked for a hanging due to his mutinous thoughts, is given clemency by his superior, Captain Christopher Newport (Plummer providing the gravitas necessary for the proceedings at hand) whose no-nonsense demeanor belies a sense of entitlement for their homeland. Smith is volunteered to go to the natives to gain enough knowledge to help his people get acclimated to the unknown world before them. Along the way Smith is at first harshly met with a beating and is bound for death until the aforementioned young girl Pocahontas (ethereal newcomer Kilcher in a very natural acting film debut) 'saves' Smith to call her own. The two begin gingerly to explore a new found relationship with Smith being extra careful not to lead the beguiling teen in the wrong direction. She in turn begins to learn English and provide him with help as he returns to the fort with a rough winter ahead (she returns with food and provisions). Naturally the men are reluctant to follow Smith's newly appointed leadership that ultimately betrays him sending him into an exiled journey north commissioned by Newport to discover new lands. Smith is bitterly disappointed but realizes it is a fools' paradise to think his love for Pocahontas, although pure, would ever last with the scrutiny their separate worlds would attract. Pocahontas is summarily also forced out of her tribe when her beloved father is incensed that she chose a white man over her own people forcing her to relocate permanently among the pioneers where she is accepted with caution yet eventually becomes one of them. Along the way she encounters John Rolfe (a nice turn by Bale), a gentlemanly tobacco farmer who is smitten by the innocent; they fall in love raising a family and are subsequently invited back to England to meet an audience with the royal family.Malick's knack for creating a familiar environ with an otherworldly dream-state narrative is on full display here and his trademark narrations seep in smoothly as does his eye for wonderful detail particularly the natural surroundings (a rush of water along the river bank; a daddy-long-leg making its rounds; a burst of marmalade sunshine) - thanks largely to the exquisite canvas provided by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki and atmospheric score by James Horner underlining the theme of alien in an alien world - mixes perfectly to the storyline but is only marred in its somewhat funereal pacing and drained of emotion acting (almost all the actors appear to be aware of every word they are annunciating with a trace of trepidation). However Kilcher is worth the price of admission for her naïve native with her girlish smile and quiet moments of contemplation into what the price she is paying to be someone else is almost heartbreaking in her delivery. A fine debut indeed.",The New World
19,evanston_dad,Malick Stumbles,6,30 January 2006,"It gives me no pleasure to report that the fourth film in nearly eight times as many years from that most roguish of Hollywood's rogue directors, Terrence Malick, is mostly a failure. Give the guy a break, though. When the first three movies you make are unequivocal masterpieces, you're allowed to stumble.All of the devices Malick has employed in previous films to turn what would be sweeping epics in the hands of any other director into feverish internal character studies are present here. But in ""The New World,"" they curiously have the reverse effect. Instead of drawing us into the minds of his characters, Malick keeps us at a distance, and his film remains too enigmatic for us to fully appreciate.The biggest problem with this movie is its non-committal tone. According to history (though granted, there are many different accounts of the Pocahontas story), John Smith was pretty much an ass, who left Pocahontas behind because he didn't really want her---in another account, he's forced to leave America because of a severe injury. Malick turns the Smith/Pocahontas story into a star-crossed lover's tale, with Smith the smoldering hero who turns away because he wants to protect Pocahontas from a world that won't accept her. Except that once she is taken in by the colonists, she's treated just fine, which makes one wonder what the big problem was to begin with. Malick uses his usual ruminating voice overs to draw us into the minds of Smith and Pocahontas, but this time around their thoughts don't communicate anything of much importance.Malick's version of the tale feels tidied up and sanitized, lacking in any dramatic conflict. When Smith meets Pocahontas again in England after a long absence, something about their exchange brings closure for her, and she is able to forget Smith and commit herself to her husband and child---but what that something is remains a mystery, for neither the screenplay nor the performances convey it. And Pocahontas's death feels rushed through; surely Malick could have trimmed one or two meandering scenes of tree and sky earlier in the film to give it a better sense of symmetry.The performances really disappoint too, but I'm not so sure that's the fault of the actors as much as it is the writing. They're not really given robust characters to play, so no one registers all that much, not even Q'orianka Kilcher, who's supposed to be a lifeforce to which everyone is drawn.""The New World"" probably warrants a second look, and I suspect I may come away admiring it more after I see it again. Malick's films aren't easy, and that's what I like about them. It's just that he's been on such firmer ground before that this movie fell way below my expectations. Immediately after leaving the theatre after seeing ""The Thin Red Line,"" I knew that I had just witnessed a masterpiece in real time. Leaving the theatre after ""The New World,"" I knew that I was just leaving.Grade: C",The New World
20,Wuchakk,"Arty, draggy historical romance",5,24 May 2014,"I've seen four of Terrence Malick's movies -- ""The New World"" (2005) and his three previous efforts, ""Badlands"" (1973), ""Days of Heaven"" (1978) and ""The Thin Red Line"" (1998). He's an arty filmmaker who isn't interested in making conventional ""blockbusters."" His three earlier efforts are all well-done and in some ways great. For instance, his pictures are always beautiful and imaginative, but there's also an airy, leisurely quality that will turn off some viewers. My favorite, by far, is ""The Thin Red Line,"" a flawed masterpiece about the taking of a hill during the Guadalcanal Campaign in WWII. It successfully transcended it's storyline to seek answers to life's most profound questions. I guess Malick does this in all his films to some degree, but he was particularly effective with ""The Thin Red Line."" I mention this to stress that I'm familiar with Malick's films and understand his approach. I was really looking forward to ""The New World,"" a historical drama detailing the establishment of the 1607 Jamestown, Virginia, colony with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and others (Christopher Plummer, Wes Studi, etc.).Shot near the actual locations on the Chickahominy River, Virginia, the film -- to be expected -- is beautiful to look at and the costumes, casting, etc. are all top-of-the-line. Unfortunately, for me, the pace is tedious and the themes aren't compelling enough to keep me spellbound. It's more than a tale of discovering a new world or new culture (for both sides); it's mostly a romance, which doesn't do much for me. Why? I'm not sure. Maybe because the pace was too draggy or possibly because I don't find Kilcher as Pocahontas all that captivating. Don't get me wrong, she's excellent in the role; I just don't find her anything to go ga-ga over, as Smith and Rolfe do in the story.One problem I have with the movie is the ridiculous romanticizing of the Natives as super-virtuous. Exhibit A is when Smith reflects in a voice-over: ""They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, no sense of possession."" Why sure! If the Indians had no sense of possession why did they attack the settlement when the Englanders failed to leave the next Spring? Why were tribes in regular warfare all over the Americas? Are we to believe not one of the Natives knew what a lie was? Or jealousy, envy, greed and slander? I get that the naturals weren't yet defiled by European-styled urbanization, but to suggest the above is pretty absurd. You can't tell me there wasn't a brave or two who had his eyes on young Pocahontas and felt a ""smidgen"" of jealousy when Smith stirred her romantic interests.The only way I can get past such nonsense and enjoy the movie is the fact that the voice-over in question was SMITH's idealized, romanticized perspective of a people with which he was enamored. In other words, it wasn't reality; it was his temporarily clouded opinion.BOTTOM LINE: ""The New World"" will be more appreciated by those who enjoy arty romantic films. For me, I'm in the middle: I see the good of the film -- even the greatness -- and value it, but I can't deny the film's shortcomings as far as a viewing experience goes. Regardless, it's great to be able to go back in time and visualize how it was when the Jamestown colony was established, highly romanticized as it is portrayed here.The film runs 136 minutes (long enough) and the extended cut 172 minutes.GRADE: C+",The New World
21,gradyharp,Awe: The Quiet Curiosity and Fear When Worlds First Meet,10,13 May 2006,"Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer. Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion, Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent 'naturals' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the 'savages' they may face in this new place. This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent.Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages: the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience, a fact that adds to the feeling of 'the other' on both sides. And it is this separateness that makes the story credible. Upon landing Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown, which he soon leaves to return to England, leaving Captain Smith in charge. It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies. The magic that occurs with this meeting of 'the stranger' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery. Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's (August Schellenberg) favored daughter Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and lives with the naturals, learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas.But Smith is returned to his fort, suffers misadventures among his own men, sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals, and eventually returns to England, telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned. Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is 'assimilated' by the new arrival of English. Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead. The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English. She discovers Smith is still alive, dies, and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown. No spoilers, these: this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school.All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over. The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner. Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film: the fact is there is little original music here, the use of Wagner's 'Das Rheingold' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments. Yes, it works, but there is not much other original music to praise.But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film. It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words. Farrell, Kilcher, Bale, Thewlis, Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary. What, then, Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown, the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures. And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today. If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter. Highly recommended. Grady Harp",The New World
22,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The New World,7,25 March 2006,"Yet another victim of incorrect marketing, for those unfamiliar with Terrence Malick's style, the trailers would have mislead you to think that The New World is one heck of a suspense filled action packed movie. It is not. What is evident is Mallick's style imprinted throughout, with characters expressing innermost thoughts through voice-over narratives, plenty of nothingness, and beautiful postcard visuals.For the new generation bred on Disney's Pocahontas, The New World is a more adult take on the tale. There is no song and dance, there is no ""magicalness"" in this new world, and there are no characters perpetually on Prozac. Think along this line: the Louis Cha martial arts classic series The Condor Heroes, and Wong Kar Wai's Ashes of Time. The former being Disney's Pocahontas in ease of understanding, the latter being Mallick's movie. Same characters, similar stories, in a grittier adult environment.The New World begins with the merry men of England's colonials seeking new grounds to set up camp, and slowly develop their new found lands. Wait, make that a bunch of hungry desperadoes on the verge of insanity when their food supplies are threatened. And they come with prejudices as well - the native Americans are categorized as savages, but as we witness ourselves, it isn't difficult to understand who the actual savages are. Discovery and exploration cut both ways. The English, through John Smith, discovers the way of the natives (ala The Last Samurai, but without much dialogue here, but plenty visuals), and the natives, being introduced to the English way of life, through the Pocahontas character. But as with clash of the cultures, the native Americans know of what the colonists have in their plans. First to establish a beach head, then to expand inwards with the possibility of threatening their own existence. What to you do in times like these? You counter-plan for a pre-emptive strike. Beginning with kindness, and if it doesn't work, then it calls for more drastic violent measures.While the big picture's that of politicking, the more focused aspect will be going behind the thoughts of the main characters - John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (newbie Q'Orianka Kilcher) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). While they do not dialogue much throughout the movie, they rely on sheer acting skills to bring their characters to life. Which somehow is a joy to watch. The innocence of Pocahontas shone through brilliantly, as did a very complex and layered John Smith. John Rolfe perhaps was the more straightforward, generous character that is the easiest to understand.Weaved into the complex narrative style is that of longing. Smith longing for the life out of the new found land, Pocahontas to eventually much spend legitimate time with Smith, and Rolfe, perhaps the shortest screen time amongst all three, added into the fray in a triangle relationship (Seriously, I'm don't qualify as a Bale groupie, but it was a really long wait before he appeared and had something to do. So fans, please take note). Besides love and longing, I was actually laughing inside at the sheer corruption of the colonists - strongest man of the moment rules, and another else can challenge the authority of those in power just with the strength of a powerful gun. Quite civilized.You have been warned. Not everyone will appreciate Mallick's works. It'll take a while to get used to during the course of the movie. You'll find many scenes with a familiar feel (didn't I see something similar a while back), especially the wheat fields, so sexy.",The New World
23,JamesHitchcock,Foundation Myth,7,21 August 2015,"During the 1970s Terrence Malick directed one excellent film, ""Badlands"", and one masterpiece, ""Days of Heaven"". After that he seemed to exile himself from the cinema for a long period, and it was twenty years before his third film, ""The Thin Red Line"", appeared. There then followed another period of silence, this time for seven years, before ""The New World"" came out in 2005.The film recounts one of the foundation myths of American history, the story of Captain John Smith and the Native American princess Pocahontas. Now although both Smith and Pocahontas were undoubtedly both historical figures, the traditional version of the story, telling how she saved his life and how the two then fell in love, may only be legend. The latter part of the story, however, dealing with her marriage to another English settler, John Rolfe, is based upon historical fact.Even though the romance of the two main figures may only be fiction, albeit a fiction hallowed by long tradition, Malick took great pains over historical details with regard to such matters as costume, weapons, tools and architecture, and shooting took place as close as possible to the site of the original Jamestown settlement in Virginia. He even went so far as to employ a linguist to reconstruct, as far as possible, the now-extinct Powhatan language which would have been spoken by the tribe to which Pocahontas belonged. In other respects, however, the film's accuracy has been faulted, in particular its advocacy of the now- fashionable idea that Native Americans were unselfish, peace-loving noble savages, quite innocent of the vices of the corrupt Old World. (In reality, Pocahontas' father owed his power and exalted position, a position which led the English settlers to regard him as a king rather than a mere chief, to his Powhatan tribe's superiority in warfare over their neighbours).Some changes to the historical record seem to have been made to make the characters more sympathetic. In reality Smith was not commanded by King James I to mount an expedition in search of the North-West Passage, but the scriptwriters must have needed an explanation for his decision to abandon Pocahontas and return to England, leaving word for her that he was dead; in the 17th century a royal command was something you disobeyed at your peril.The film is well acted, with notable performances from Colin Farrell as Smith, Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas and (in a smaller but key role) Christian Bale as Rolfe. (Remarkably, Kilcher was only 14 at the time). The relationship between these three can be described as a sort of love- triangle because, although Pocahontas does not meet Rolfe until after she has been wrongly informed that Smith is dead, she still harbours feelings for her former lover. Both the main characters are torn by inner conflicts, Smith between his love for Pocahontas and his duty towards his king and country, and Pocahontas between her love for Smith and her inability to love her husband, whom she knows to be a good and kind man. Her inner conflict becomes all the greater when she realises that Smith is still alive.As in his first two films, Malick makes effective use of music, with Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 taking on the role that was played by Orff's ""Gassenhauer"" in ""Badlands"" and Saint-Saëns' ""Aquarium"" in ""Days of Heaven"". Although there are some attractive shots, I did not, however, find the film as visually attractive as its predecessors, especially ""Days of Heaven"" which is notable for its strikingly beautiful photography throughout. In my view, however, the film's main fault is that it is overlong and, in places, too slow-moving. Malick's original 150-minute version was later cut to 135 minutes, but even this seemed too long for a story which could have been told in two hours or less. (I understand that there is also a third, 172-minute version, which has never been shown in cinemas).The film did not do well at the Academy Awards, only receiving one nomination, but several critics hailed it as a masterpiece. Some of these praised the film in quite extravagant terms. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said that it ""contains some of the best film- making imaginable – some of it beyond imagining"" and John Patterson of the Guardian confessed to literally weeping ""tears of exultation"". I know how these critics felt. I felt like that on watching ""Days of Heaven"", but ""The New World"" was never able to move me in the same way. 7/10",The New World
24,namashi_1,Poetry!,9,9 September 2015,"Terrence Malick delivers Poetry with 'The New World'. A riveting, heart-melting film, with a historical touch.

'The New World' Synopsis: The story of the English exploration of Virginia, and of the changing world and loves of Pocahontas.'The New World' has strong characters, that lead the narratively firmly. Malick's Screenplay isn't just a Pocahontas legend, its also about mother nature, its about love, its about war & violence. The film flows beautifully & Emmanuel Lubezki's Mesmerising Cinematography makes the film a visual delight! Malick's Direction is poetic. He's a master at his craft, who combines nature in his storytelling. And he does it so effortlessly. 'The New World' is amongst his most sensitive works to date. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Editing is perfect (I have watched the 135-minute version). A Special Mention for the legendary James Horner, who's score is simply enchanting.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell gives his all. The supremely talented actor is subtle & throughly believable. Christian Bale has a small role, but he enacts it remarkably. Christopher Plummer adds weight to his part. But its Q'orianka Kilcher who steals the show. As Pocahontas, the performer brings life to a difficult, tender part & shines from start to end. On the whole, 'The New World' is truly a memorable piece in filmmaking. Watch it for the master that is Terrence Malick.",The New World
25,StevePulaski,"The intensity is there, but the focus isn't",7,10 October 2011,"At first glance, one could say Terrence Malick, one of the most respected directors in Hollywood, is now trading his personal take on movies and taking a shot at one of the most famous American stories. Well - when one hears the plot to The New World, the latest film by Malick, we can clearly see he chose to focus on the myth of John Smith and Pocahontas rather than the actual story. But, even though this story has been told before, it is told through the eyes of an incredible man.The history and trivia following The New World, I must admit, is better than the film itself. The story for the film was written in the early seventies, but due to financial setbacks it wasn't until 2005 would it see the light of day. This is Terrence Malick's fourth film in over thirty years, cementing the fact that he takes time and effort to perfect his stories.He tells the story of Captain John Smith, played by Collin Farrell, an English explorer who makes the famed ""Jamestown Expedition"" with his crew and stumbles upon a village in Virginia in 1607. Smith, Captain Christopher Newport (Plummer), and the other crew-mates are met with a Native American tribe. Though she is never referred to by name, Pocahontas (Kilcher), is the main character from the tribe and the film begins to tell the fictionalized romance between Smith and Pocahontas, while including the incredible fear of being around an unsettling group of people from both points of view.While this story is going on, we get amazing shots of grass, water, rivers, birds, the sun, the skyline, and the wildlife depicted in such an exquisite nature it is almost breathtaking. The highest point of the film is the beautiful, enriching cinematography. Malick is known for bringing the setting and the beauty of the land to the foreground of the picture rather than leaving it as many film-makers do; a scenic backdrop only occasionally brought into full focus. The enticing images make up for a film that lacks in greater fields.Because this is Malick, the story is non-linear and very jumpy. This worked for his latest picture, The Tree of Life, because it was a simpler story and one from his own mind. With The New World, the story of Jamestown is a little harder to follow for many people, and it doesn't help matters that the film can hardly stay focused on its characters. The story is still told with clarity, but because of the quiet dialog (which sometimes can literally be incomprehensible), the sluggish pace, and the awkward narrations, it feels like the film is making itself harder to watch and harder to focus on.Sometimes, I'd be lost for several minutes staring aimlessly into the backdrop of the scenery. Since it's the prime focus of the film, I don't think Malick would be ashamed to hear that. But the lack of clarity in the story, and the constant drifts from scenery to storyline do make the film a chore to follow at some points. Not to mention, the film runs already lengthy at a one-hundred and thirty five minute runtime. Because of the story and the artsy feel, it feels every bit as long as that and sometimes longer. The original cut is nearing three hours which I honestly can't believe. I had a hard time sitting still the final half-hour of the shorter cut.The acting is one of the strongest points in the film, however. Collin Farrell's role as Captain Smith feels not acted but every-bit as natural as it was meant to be. Christopher Plummer, whose narrations in My Dog Tulip were fantastic, gives a great performance here as well. And you can't leave out the extraordinary work of Q'orianka Kilcher as the teenage Pocahontas.Because of the time of release, the story itself, and the eclectic man at the camera, New Line Cinema will clearly be struggling to make their money back from The New World. While I'm still getting used to Malick, and the fact that stories from past the 1800's don't quite pull me in so fast, I can't be considered the normal reaction for a film like this. I recommend this to strict Malick fans, but also see fans of history and the Jamestown Expedition enjoying the film quite a bit too. For me - this was a fairly lengthy journey, but it wasn't a lost cause.Starring: Collin Farrell, Q'orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale.

26,sddavis63,"Beautifully Filmed, But Quite Lacking In Story",2,1 August 2011,"I can completely understand those people who speak of how beautifully photographed and filmed this movie was. It truly was. Director Terence Malick deserves credit for that. The sceneries were lovely, and the re- creation of early 17th century Jamestown had a feel of authenticity to it that's often lacking in movies such as this. If that's all you were to rate a movie on then this movie would have to be rated spectacularly. But there's more to a movie than the photography and scenery. There's story and pacing. On that count, I can also completely understand those people who speak of how poorly paced this movie was and how dull it was in many ways. I fall on the side of the latter group in this debate. As beautifully filmed as this was, the story failed to hold me. At 2:15, this movie isn't outrageously long compared to some, but it seemed to be. The movie appropriately documents the early development of Jamestown as happening within the context of a clash between English and native American culture. That would have been more powerful if it hadn't then chosen to buy into the myth of the Pocahantas-John Smith romance, around which the movie largely revolved. The broad brush strokes of Pocahantas' life are accurate - from her upbringing with her native tribe in America to her later life in England with John Rolfe - but Smith isn't accurately depicted, and the romance between the two, from what I know, is fiction.Colin Farrell as Smith was surprisingly low-key (considering that he's - well - Colin Farrell!) but he was OK in the role, and newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher was about the same as Pocahantas. The movie - with its slow- moving and largely unfocused story - rises or falls on how well you can appreciate a movie based almost solely on its artistic merits. For me, I needed more of a coherent story to keep me involved. (2/10)",The New World
27,Buddy-51,an hypnotic and mesmerizing work of art,10,4 February 2006,"When you see Terrence Malick's ""The New World,"" you feel as if you are watching an exquisite poem coming to life on the big screen. This achingly beautiful work is only the fourth film in over thirty years by Malick, one of the least prolific and most talented directors in American movies. As with his previous films, ""Badlands,"" Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" Malick eschews storyline and action for artistry and mood.""The New World"" is a haunting evocation of that moment when two alien cultures met for the first time face to face. The year is 1607 and a fleet of ships dispatched by King James of England arrives on the shores of North America to establish a new settlement called (what else?) Jamestown. There to greet them is a beautiful young Indian princess known to us as Pocahontas who winds up captivating and falling in love with John Smith, the future leader of the settlement. Along with the expected clash of cultures, Malick showcases the heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love but are ultimately kept apart by their differences.Nobody captures the sheer exquisiteness of the natural landscape better than Malick, and every shot here is a masterpiece of composition, form and lighting. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has wrought endless miracles with his camera in terms of both movement and the framing of his subjects. Although the film is extremely studied and slow-moving, it is never static or boring, so enthralled are we by what it is showing us. Malick reminds us here that for all the advancements made in the art of special effects, it is good old-fashioned photography that can really make the jaw drop and the eye pop when it is done this well. Moreover, Malick has used natural sound beautifully, weaving it into the fabric of his love story, much as he has done with the exquisite and haunting musical score composed by James Horner (""Titanic"").Even though the characters say little to one another - much of the dialogue comes in the form of voice-over recitations of journal entries or interior monologues - the filmmaker is able to convey romantic yearning with extraordinary force, primarily through facial expressions, bodily movements and lyrical camera-work. As Smith, Collin Farrell provides just the right combination of brooding introspection and wistful tender-heartedness to make the romance work. 15-year-old newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher turns Pocahontas into an almost ethereal presence, perfectly matching the dreamlike nature of the film.It would appear that the Motion Picture Academy has chosen to snub this film in most of the major categories (with the exception of cinematography). What a shame, for even though some people might dismiss ""The New World"" as just Art with a capital ""A,"" this is actually one of the most enthralling and cinematically beautiful films of recent times. It has the rare ability to transport you to a different world and leave you aching for more.",The New World

I was right the first time. It was very long and boring and basically one long love story. It did have some awesome nature scenes and some cool artsy parts but overall it was pretty bad.

29,paul2001sw-1,Dances with sheep,4,28 September 2010,"Terrence Malick has made a handful of loose, impressionist films over four decades; 'The New World' is perhaps his most impressionistic yet, but also his most unsatisfactory. It tells the story of Pocohantas, the native American who married an early settler; as in some other tellings of the same tale, he imagines an earlier, competing relationship with the first settler who met and described her. The film attempts to give a flavour of the difficult, confused times faced by settlers and natives which provided the political, social and military backdrop to Pocahantas ultimately being offered to the white man as hostage for the indigenous people's safety. It certainly succeeds in conveying the confusion, because Mallick seems to wilfully disregard every convention of movie storytelling, preferring to give us disjointed scenes from his characters' lives instead of trying to fuse them into a coherent narrative. While one appreciates his desire not to make life appear more linear than it is, the desire for narrative is a natural human one, not just in film audiences but also in people living their own lives; we find stories amid the chaos to make sense of ourselves, and Mallick's failure to do so on behalf of his characters is frustrating. As a love triangle, it doesn't work either, because the two men she falls for are (compared with everyone else in the story) uninterestingly similar; and I never really felt I learnt much about the inner lives of any of the protagonists (Pocohantas, for example, is throughout a picture of serene inscrutability). Ultimately, I didn't understand what Malick was trying to do with this movie; and it's great length left me indifferent and perplexed long before the end.",The New World
30,g-bodyl,Gotta Love Terrence Malick!,8,31 March 2013,"When you watch enough movies like I have, you will have the ability to tell who directed a movie just based off cinematography and visuals. I could tell right away this is a Terrence Malick film thanks to his wonderful, stunning visuals portrayed in The New World. This movie can be a little long and the script doesn't seem to be that sharp, but Malick's direction and above-average acting makes this a wonderful history lesson to behold.This film is the true story of the Pocahontas legend. This story tells the story of how the early colonists landed in Jamestown and one them, John Smith forges a relationship with one of the natives that will change their lives.This film is acted very well. Colin Farrell doesn't get the recognition he deserves especially when he stars in films like this. We don't see Christian Bale until the later part of the movie but he has a nice, toned-down performance unlike his Batman film which came out the same year.Overall, this is a film just worth seeing for it's majestic beauty. It's almost a crime that it underperformed at the box office. This could have been a perfect movie thanks to the source material, but it is held down slightly by a weaker script than I expected and some choppy editing but all-in-all I was very pleased.

31,secondtake,"A huge masterpiece riddled with flaws? Yes, compelling by the end for sure.",8,18 February 2013,"The New World (2005)This is surely some kind of masterpiece of a movie, though also plagued slightly by its length, by a tendency to sentiment, and by moments of wonder (by the characters) that get repetitive. Director Terrence Malick has left his mark here as with, say, ""Days of Heaven,"" creating something large but not quite larger than life. His intention is to make life as large as it really is. By some miracle I saw the whole thing and didn't know it was the Pocahontas story, which was terrific (though I jokingly said in the middle of it that she's like Pocahontas, having never seen the Disney version). This helped me keep a neutral stance on it all, thinking it was just a typical view of two cultures--European and Native American--coming into extensive, complicated interaction. The way you come to see the main young woman's view of the world, both the new world she live in and her own new world when she goes to England, is stirring. Stirring.That's what finally made the movie after having at times to be patient with the director's tendency to indulge in the beauty created by his crew, especially the cinematographers. This is an exquisitely luscious film in many ways--some might say excessively, the sunset always sublime and the verdant world green. But it makes for good watching. It's an immersive experience. It puts you there.The sets and the setting are superbly thought out and legitimate copies of what the first successful English settlers in Virginia would have seen and made. (There were lengthy documentary segments with my rented version of the movie.) The costumes, the thatch and wood structures, the general smoky rainy glimmery twilight moods, all of this was gorgeous. Most (nearly all) of the shooting was done with a hand held camera, what used to be called a steadicam. Even conventional dialog scenes where the camera shows someone talking reveals a little (gently buffered) camera movement. Other scenes have a constantly moving camera, fluid and jerky both. All of this gives the film from start to finish a living, breathing feeling. It's quite nice as a work for the eyes, no question about that.The editing is equally remarkable. Malick has lots of footage shot, and one thing this gives him is lots of options for editing, and indeed the mix of points of view is part of the visual energy of the whole. There are many moments where the edit is unexpected, or very sudden, or counterintuitive, which is elegantly sustained from start to finish.What is weak at times is some of the acting, or some of the choreographed movements, which seem a hair affected, or made to be cinematic rather than true. I suppose that's Malick's choice and a matter of taste. More annoying is the director's tendency to have characters stop and admire the bark on a tree or the light coming from overhead as they crane and look up. Yes, that's what you might do, all of us, but not over and over. And over. In the same way there are sometimes repeating moments that are not quite flashbacks that reprise an earlier mood and in fact it seems (to the slightly bedazzled viewer) that times have changed, that this is not quite where the characters are at any more. In all of Malick's movies he has a style with actors that often makes them restrained and even lifeless. It strikes me as terrible movie-making on some level (Brad Pitt in ""Tree of Life"" is hard to swallow), but I try to see it as style. That might be generous. You'll find Colin Farrell restrained, often, and mumbling, too, and what makes clear his lack of usual energy is the documentary videos of the same scenes where he's more himself. It's subtle, I think, but it's cumulative with all the actors over all the film. The one exception might be Pocahontas herself, played by American/Swiss/Quechua Peruvian actress (born in Germany) Q'orianka Kilcher. She's allowed to be utterly lively and a necessary spark amidst all these burly men.One thing Malick has going for him here is the story is epic and moving. The material is automatically interesting. He takes credit (as he always does) as the writer, but of course the story is not his, it's history. And it's a history brought to life. It's not for everyone, but it will survive even doubters on many levels, including for its ambition. This is a sprawling, unique movie and you should give it a try.",The New World
32,Dr_Coulardeau,Forget the body painting,7,27 October 2012,"This version has many positive points indeed. For one the Indians are real Indians. For two the Indian life style is a lot more realistic than in most other versions and what happens in the films is more credible than in most other versions. It is highly probably that the Indians were a lot more hostile than thought as soon as they understood the English were going and planning to stay, and thus Smith had lied to them and promised their departure whereas he knew it was a lie.The other side is just as realistic. The English die like flies the first year of diseases, cold and hunger, and also because of the Indians but this vision of the English is also realistic in the extreme violence they were confronted to and the extreme violence they submitted the Indians to. The Indians tried to overwhelm them with numbers but the English just burnt the villages and killed everyone, burnt the harvests and the crops forcing the Indians to go away or starve before being exterminated. The film is even clear about the intention of pushing the Indians away from the very start.But apart from that realistic dimension of the film, the story itself is an embellished love story that has little to do with what probably really happened. Pocahontas was ten when Smith appeared and not a grown young woman. Her religious position and training is not at all explicated and thus the Indian culture is not at all exploited as a highly spiritual culture. It is reduced to some kind of ritualistic, superstitious, extremely ""primitive"" behavior and relishing paint and other body adornments. All testimonies show clearly that the Indian civilization was a highly advanced one in the field of mental and spiritual empathy with other people and with the other side of reality, the supernatural side that more or less dictates its energetic lead to this world.But the worst part is the erasing of the real chronology and the role of Argall in the game. The abduction is supposedly coming after the ""father"" of Pocahontas had banned her from the tribe into exile into another tribe of the Powhatan alliance. That erases the Indian husband Pocahontas had, and her Indian son. That erases the abduction, the killing of her Indian husband and the escape of her Indian son who had been moved to some relatives when the Indians realized Pocahontas was being fooled into abduction. That also more or less makes the abduction easier: she believes she is being saved from exile by her Captain Smith.The fable of Smith being saved by her is of course central though this is only in the second version of the event that Smith gave in 1624, two years after the bloody upheaval of the Indians, which had an obvious impact on the whole testimony on the colony up to 1622. In his first account of 1608 there is nothing about his life being menaced and it being saved then by Pocahontas. The love affair is of course justified by that salvation.Then the marriage with John Rolfe is hyper-unrealistic. During her abduction she was raped. She gave birth to her mixed-blood son before being married to John Rolfe and that son, strangely enough is named after the governor of the Colony, Sir Thomas Dale, who had had access to her during her captivity, and even worse, John Rolfe, the secretary of the colony, did not register his ""own"" son on the books of the colony, showing that either the boy was not his son and he did not care registering him, or that he was considered as a non-entity because he was a mixed-blood, revealing the basic racism of the English towards the Indians and the clear anti-Indian policy of the Church of England. All that is just forgotten in the film.The final untruth is of course about her death. The film forgets to tell us the captain of the trip to England and back to America was Argall, the captain who abducted her, and the film pretends she knew before going to London that Smith was not dead, and hence had lied to her and to the Powhatan alliance. That makes the death easy and the hypothesis of her being poisoned is nicely evacuated. At the same time what happens to her son is not that clear.The last element that is absolutely unacceptable is the music that has nothing to do with the historical period and the Indian context of many scenes. No Indian music and in England we have piano music as if the piano already existed in the early 16th century.So it is interesting to see the film because of its realism but it is highly un-historical if not anti-historical. Could have done better with a little help from simple historical research. Real history is just as entertaining as ideological biased story-telling.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",The New World
33,eddie_baggins,A beautiful look at the birth of a nation,9,15 December 2019,"Undoubtedly not for everyone, Terrence Malick's slow moving yet quietly powerful and astoundingly beautiful epic The New World is a stunningly realised cinematic experience, that must surely go down as one of the most naturally beautifully and heartfelt pieces of filmmaking ever delivered, as the divisive Texan filmmaker takes us on a ponderous and contemplative trip back to the early America's to tell the true story of Pocahontas and her life filled with love and heartbreak.Here reviewing the Extended Cut of Malick's film, drawn out to near 3 hours from its 2 and a half hour theatrical cut, The New World is never afraid to bask in its own thoughtful and imagery driven nature and for those that found the original cut too much to handle this is a version of the film you'd do best to steer very far away from but for anyone that has ever found themselves transfixed by Malick's unique filmmaking sensibilities, this stoically paced version of Malick's tale will be a joy to be a part of.It's hard to put into words just how beautifully put together and hypnotic The New World is should you let it wash over you and take you away in a manner that only Malick at its best can do, as the filmmaker's collaboration with legendary production designer Jack Fisk and renowned cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki achieves resounding results in this end product.It's not hard to see the similarities to Lubezki's work here to Oscar heavyweight The Revenant on which he was inspired by The New World from and his collaboration with Malick really is a match made in heaven, as if nothing else, this dream-like experience takes us on a visually splendid adventure to a time and place long since forgone.Key to the effectiveness and moving nature of Malick's grand vision here however is how his clear affiliation and respect for the story of Pocahontas allows him to deliver one of his most straight-forward and accessible films of his career.Never officially named in the film as Pocahontas, the Native American princess is luminously brought to life by then first time actress Q'orianka Kilcher, who lights up the film with her verve and energy that combines well with the more solid but grounded work of lead actors Christian Bale and Colin Farrell.Her turn ranks right up the best turns in a Malick film, up there with Sissy Spacek's unforgettable performance in Badlands and Jessica Chastain's glowing turn in The Tree of Life and while the film may not reach the near perfectly pitched highs of Malick's adored Days of Heavens, Badlands, The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life, The New World is arguably not far away from being just as quintessential as those works, works that assured Malick would go down as one of the all-time great filmmakers, regardless of the naysayers and unaffected by the more forgettable entries that Malick has delivered over the last decade.Watching Pocahontas's story unfold before our very eyes as her love for Farrell's John Smith and then Christian Bales John Rolfe takes us on a spellbinding nature filled journey, examining man's place in this world and quest to better our more bloodthirsty and primitively destructive spirits is a cinematic delight, that whilst not perfect, is more affecting and illuminating that so many other cookie cutter offerings that Malick has managed to avoid over an impressively constructed career, driven by projects that inspire and move him and allow us as an audience to be left memorized by the results.Final Say -Allowing more time to enjoy the beauty on screen, this extended version of The New World is a must-watch for fans of Malick's work, as the once in a lifetime talent showcases a love story for the ages, that just so happens to act as one of the most eye-capturing films ever shot.4 ½ kettles out of 5",The New World
34,johnnyboyz,Malick brings his own ingenuity to a story we all know but it cannot save the film from being what it is.,6,20 October 2008,"A lot can be said for The New World, Terrence Malick's take on the true story of British settlers at Jamestown and the consequential love between two people of warring sides, those people being John Smith and Pocahontas. I think the story works or at least people take to it because it reminds us of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, itself a fable about two people interacting under the radar of two opposing sides. Granted, the British settlers and the Native Americans are not obviously hostile from the beginning but by the time the fight scenes have arrived, it's enough of a wait for the two to have spent time with one another and fallen in love. In this sense The New World works because Smith is allowed to spend time within the boundaries of the 'enemy', something both Romeo and Juliet could never do with the Montagues and the Capulets hating each other from the off.I think the trouble with The New World as an overall film is the clash of priorities it most definitely has. The film is artistic and creative in its shot choice and more often than not puts you in a status of dreamlike consciousness; it does this through its frequent use of cutaways to foliage and other such natural pieces of iconography like rivers, flowing water and trees swaying in the breeze; all of these shots are usually accompanied with dizzying music and rendered quite obvious in the film's demand for an artistic labelling.But this is half of the clash. The New World is essentially a genre picture, with the romance of Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas (Kilcher) placing the film into that specific type. Later on, Pocahontas will strike up a relationship of some description with another John, this time it's Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Bale's casting, by the time the film was made, meant the film was almost guaranteed to appeal to the teenage girl audience. Indeed, Farrell's inclusion ensured they would keep watching up to the first half and Bale's inclusion meant they'd keep going. Although the fact of the matter is that these two roles could well have been played by mostly any body since they demand the actor stand around, act neutral for most of the time and deliver whatever short bursts of dialogue when required.People say of Terrance Malick that he fits the auteur labelling; The New World is good ammunition for that argument. Most of us are familiar with the tale of the British settlers landing in America and encountering the Native Americans thanks largely through Disney's 1995 animated effort, itself rather underrated I thought, and it's because of this film I am familiar with said fable. But Malick takes this old, old story that has an essence of Romeo and Juliet within it and stamps it with his own creative, artistic touch. The cutaways to the rural backdrops of trees and water are included but they feel as if they are better things lurking below the surface, every so often having a peek over top, trying to get out. The good use of the jungle locations may remind us of Aguirre: The Wrath of God and the sparse use of dialogue feels at home given the approach to the material.So although there isn't anything wrong with the direction, The New World feels like the wrong film from the right director. It's really just a take on an event the mainstream will probably have heard of from a man the mainstream probably won't have heard of. The inclusion of Farrell, Bale and a good cast in general will attract those cast hungry people; predominantly teenagers and the artistic approach the film carries will make them go away thinking they've just seen something really smart. I didn't take to it as much as I thought I would. The fact John Smith is played by an Irishman is a little distracting, following on from the casting of Australian born Mel Gibson who came complete with an American accent of course, who played Smith in Disney's 1995 version. It seems the Americans, bless them, cannot bring themselves to cast an Englishman or indeed a Brit. for the role of John Smith.Then there are the other things like having Q'orianka Kilcher dressed up really fancy-like for the role of Pocahontas. As a character, she seems to be the only Native American female between the ages of 16-25 located on the entire continent. The fact that when she swaggers around she looks like a budding lap dancer, exchanging glances with Farrell in a dialogue sparse film remember, is distracting enough but the modern makeup and eerie sense she is supposed to be the object of the audience's gaze just feels out of place and somewhat disturbing. Pocahontas is young, attractive and doesn't say an awful lot thanks largely to the language barrier that exists between her and Smith. It's this level of anonymity that exists within her character on screen that will garner most attention from the teenage female audience as they associate themselves with her and watch (themselves) fall in love with Farrell all over again. I watch most films for their direction and the approach Malick brings to this fable is enough to warrant The New World a watch but all the other stuff going on between characters is slow and weak when it isn't plain uninteresting in the first place, how frustrating.",The New World
35,Petey-10,Beautiful tale of two cultures meeting,9,22 April 2009,"The place is Virginia, the year is 1607.Three ships of the Jamestown Expedition,led by Captain Newport,arrive and the Native Americans are witnessing this.When two cultures meet it means bloody battles.The English men build a fort there.John Smith leaves the fort to explore another area and trade with the Indians, but he gets captured.But it is princess Pocahontas that saves John Smith's life.Captain Smith and Pocahontas find romance with each other.Once he is released he becomes the leader in the fort.People live in terrible conditions there, they don't have much to eat, there are diseases, people are dying...The whole situation seems pretty hopeless.And there is another battle to be expected with the Indians, who see that the English will not leave their country.Also Smith loses the trust of their men, when he disagrees with them trading Pocahontas and lodging her in the fort to protect their families.Then Captain Newport returns from England and informs Smith that the king has offered him the opportunity to lead a new expedition of his own to find a new passage to the West Indies.Smith returns to England instead and asks his friend to tell Pocahontas that he has died in the crossing.All the beauty of Pocahontas' life is now gone.Then John Rolfe, a tobacco planter arrives and wants Pocahontas.He marries her, after she's baptised, but she still has a place in her heart that belongs to John Smith.Terrence Malick is the writer and director of The New World (2005).This is a very poetic movie.Malick has portrayed beautifully the story of these people.Especially those moments between Smith and Pocahontas, but you can find some beauty in the battle scenes, also.And he has done an excellent job capturing the era on screen.There's nothing to remind of our times there.It's almost like watching a documentary on how these people lived.There are some outstanding performances in the movie.Colin Farrell does a role of the lifetime as John Smith.Q'orianka Kilcher is very sensuous in her part as Pocahontas.I think we'll be hearing from her in the future.Christopher Plummer gives another fine performance as Captain Newport.Christopher Bale is great as John Rolfe.Wes Studi does a good job playing Openhancanough.Ben Chaplin plays Robinson and John Savage is Savage.The love story portrayed in this movie is beautiful.Watch this piece of art and step back to the 17th century.",The New World
36,leonblackwood,Really Slow! 3/10,3,15 September 2013,"Review: Man, this film was boring! Maybe that was because it was over 2 hours long with hardly any dialogue. The whole film relied on the vision and emotions from the characters which does get tedious after a while. I liked the beginning when Farrell had to learn how to live with the natives, but after that the whole film goes all over the place and the lady character gets pushed into uncomfortable situations. The pace of the film is REALLY slow and I struggled to stay awake. The ending is rushed without much consideration for the audience who has spent 2 hours following the characters journey. I personally thought that the film captured the time period well, but it cold have easily been shorter because the director wasted a lot of time showing the characters walking through grass stroking each other. Disappointing!Round-Up: The film shows Collin Farrell and Christian Bale earlier on in the career they became household names. Christopher Plummer is only in a couple of scenes and Christian Bale only comes I near the end. You don't get to see Bale & Farrell together on screen, but they both put in average performances, due to the pace of the whole movie. If you liked the Tree Of Life, which I personally couldn't stand, then you will enjoy this film because it is made by the same director who also made the Thin Red Line. In all, it is what you expect from this director and I'm sure that I missed the whole moral of the story like I did in that awful Tree Of Life.Budget: $30million Worldwide Gross: $30.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there deep period drama's movies that are set in 1607 when the Americans were fighting for land with the natives. 3/10",The New World
37,howard.schumann,Beyond beautiful,10,15 May 2006,"With the newest Terrence Malick film, The New World, one looks for words that express a quality beyond beautiful, but there is no language. It is a work of stunning cinematic poetry whose appreciation, I believe, will grow with the passage of time, though it may never appeal to a wide audience. I came away from watching The New World with a feeling of having traveled back in time to a land of pristine beauty where the vigorous dream of establishing a sane civilization was still alive, if only for a brief moment. Malick attempts a retelling of that dream, specifically the vision of Pocahontas, the Indian princess, daughter of Algonquian Chief Powhatan, who imagined a country where both Europeans and Natives could live together without bloodshed.While actual events may have been somewhat different, Malick takes the story at face value, enhancing it only with voice overs that allow us to enter the minds of the characters and feel what they are feeling. The film opens with the arrival of three English ships docking on the James River in Virginia in 1607 to the music of Wagner's Das Rheingold. It then describes the early days of the settlers, their near starvation, the clashes with the Indians, and the relationship between Pocahontas and Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), a rebellious English explorer awaiting execution for insubordination. When the Indians capture Smith during an expedition to seek trading partners, he is threatened with death until Pocahontas saves him from execution by cradling his head in her lap and laying her head on his shoulders.The Captain and Pocahontas become friends but the true nature of their relationship is clouded in myth and allegory. In the film, however, the Captain and his Indian princess express a love so intense that it suggests a state of grace. As Smith is drawn under her spell, he thinks about abandoning his life, to ""start over.... exchange this false life for a true one.... give up the name of Smith."" But the thought is fleeting. After Pocahontas warns the Captain of an impending raid by her villagers, her father sends her into exile. The settlers take her hostage, however, convert her to Christianity (not shown in the film), and dress her in frumpy English attire, but she is content just being close to the man she loves.Smith leaves Pocahontas, however, to explore the Canadian North for a trade route to the Indies, instructing a friend to tell her after two months that he died at sea. His betrayal and their doomed love affair serve as a metaphor for the failure of the Natives and the Europeans to live together in harmony. The spark in Pocahontas' life flickers but when a new settler, tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale), arrives, he falls in love with her and asks her to marry him. She must now decide whether to follow her head and marry Rolfe or her heart, holding out for the return of Captain Smith. Her resolution of this dilemma takes her to England where the process of discovery takes on a new meaning.The role of Pocahontas is played by fourteen-year old Q'orianka Kilcher in a powerful and brilliant performance that never strikes a false note. While the director has excised most of the dialogue, little is required to convey the depth of feeling written on her soulful face or on the faces of Smith and Rolfe. Whoever Pocahontas really was, Malick depicts her as a spiritual force and the film achieves transcendence through her vision. The New World is a meditation on love and loss, innocence and betrayal, and the limitations of a society based on material progress.It is also a lament for the civilization that might have been: a multi-ethnic society rich in spirituality and closeness to nature, inhabited by people with a sense of community, devoid of fear. For the English explorers, the landing at Jamestown and the colonizing of Virginia was a triumph. For Native Americans, it was the beginning of a tragedy that lasted for centuries and continues to the present day. Though The New World is a masterful film and thoroughly enchanting, our knowledge of what is to come leaves a lingering sadness.",The New World

39,funkyfry,Very interesting,7,8 June 2009,"These days we're never sure if we're seeing revisionist history, or corrections to the revisionist history of past movie myth-makers. Terrence Malick and his collaborators made the interesting choice, in telling the tale of the Jamestown settlement, of avoiding details altogether and basically turning it into a totally immersive and impressionistic version of history. I have to say I like the movie overall, although it takes a bit of a nosedive in the last portion for me.Malick's representation of Jamestown itself is flawless as far as I can tell. I recognized the location as the exact copy of that part of Virginia, being raised in Virginia myself and having been to Jamestown many times, so I wasn't surprised to learn that it was filmed 5 miles from the original site of the colony. The amount of dedication and detail given to the Native American habitats and inhabitants is equal to that given to the English colonists. Instead of the kind of groan-inducing reverse-propaganda and revisionism that you see in films like ""Dances with Wolves"", this film depicts the natives as very ""savage"" but never lets you doubt that they had good reason to treat the invaders in precisely this way. It allows you to basically empathize with both sides. In a general sense, what was happening was a tragedy, the loss of an entire world of cultures. Yes, ""New World"" is definitely being used here in an ironic sense. However by focusing on individual people like John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher) -- her name is never spoken in the film -- whose lives became entangled in the larger political consequences, the film manages to convey the sense that the moral implications of all these events were never cut and dried. There were never any heroes and villains, as this movie tells the story.The brilliant and dynamic camera-work in the film is often undermined, however, by inferior performances. Bale never seems to be interesting when he's playing a good guy. Kilcher is stunning to look at but has no real talent in acting. Her whole range of emotions is frowning and laughing. Worst of all is Colin Farrel, strutting about as if lost in some other movie where he actually is the hero. Oddly though, Farrel's character is the most appealing of the bunch. And I was pleased to see the often abused but very talented character actor Michael Savage popping up in a couple scenes.I'm actually glad I saw this on video, because I think that the pure visual excellence of the movie would have overpowered me in the theater and I might have been tricked into thinking it was a great movie. It is a good movie, but far from great. I recognize and respect the fact that the producers and director took a lot of chances with this movie, and I wish that more films were made this way. However the results are not always 100% convincing or appealing.",The New World
40,lisafordeay,Boring,4,25 September 2020,"The New World is a 2005 Historic drama based on the legend of Pocahontas and a somewhat remake of the 1995 animated film from Disney. It stars Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer,Irene Bedard and Christian Bale,directed by Terrence Malick.The daughter of the chief of Virginia Pocahontas falls in love with an English captain named John Smith(Farrell)and their cultures change forever.The film is been told through John Smith's point of view as he narrates the film. I gotta give it credit for James Horner's score and the costumes are nice too since it fits in with the 1907 setting.
If you can deal with the large age gap between Pocahontas and John Smith you should be fine.
Keep an eye out for the original Pocahontas(Irene Bedard) and Christian Bale who was also Thomas in the original one).I read that the film bombed at the box office and it got a cult following.",The New World
41,Chris Knipp,Into thin air,8,25 December 2005,"Terrence Malick's The New World is a strange mixture of mud and poetry. The writer-director scores with the beginning and end, both in silence (with crickets). Often as it's been done, there's never been a ship-arriving-to-shore-aswarm-with-natives sequence that has had quite this hushed magic and real-ness. We look over the naked shoulders of the ""naturals,"" as the Anglos interestingly denominate them, while they in turn look out with awe and excitement at the boats on the water. Ah if we could only cherish the terrible immanence of this historical moment  the 1607 arrival of what's to become ""the first permanent English settlement in America"" -- for two hours and a half. But of course that wouldn't work. Though the movie has longeurs, they're not that extreme. If we can see past the mannerisms, Malick is the man to take us to the new world. The moods he creates are incomprehensible enough to be ""real."" But he doesn't know quite what to do with us once he's got us there. Despite much good atmosphere and ravishing images, what follows the magical opening turns out to be disappointingly flimsy and mundane.Malick is a strange mixture himself, a Hollywood heavy who's made hardly any movies, and an art film pretender who increasingly uses standard matinée idol types. With Christopher Plummer and David Thewlis and veteran Native American actors like Wes Studi and August Schellenberg (Powhatan) to back them up and the appealing Pacific Islander-looking newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher (who's actually half Swiss and half Peruvian Indian) as Pocahontas, we're given Colin Farrell and Christian Bale. And that's who we have to look at and believe they're Captain John Smith and John Rolfe, respectively. It's debatable if any sense of historical authenticity can survive all the great big close-ups we get of Farrell's and Bale's soulful and sweet faces, respectively. The magic is broken. You just know you're watching a movie.So the ships arrive, Christopher Plummer as Captain Christopher Newport in charge, Captain John Smith (Farrell) brought along in chains for insubordination, then released benevolently by Newport to have a chance at a new start in the new land. When Newport later leaves, Smith takes over.In these early scenes we already get glimpses of Pocahantas, and it isn't long before she and Captain John Smith meet and fall in love. In the movie, what historians say was really more like a father-daughter relationship (the princess was only twelve, not even Q'Orianka's age, fourteen) is thrown back to the myth of a romance, and a lot of screen time is devoted to mooning at each other and rubbing noses between Q'Orianka and Colin, who uses a full-on Irish accent here, which isn't necessarily so inauthentic: the way the English used to talk sounded like Irish, only none of the other Englishmen talk that way, being English. Anyway the great love grows, platonically.After getting kidnapped on a mission to find the local king, Smith has been growing fat and fit among the ""naturals"" and, it turns out, teaching Pocahontas to speak perfect English (but without the Irish accent), when he goes back to the colony and discovers that they're starving. He returns to a vicious slum, and a knot of Dickensian boys talking over each other fearfully and saying strange things, apparently crazed by hunger. Captain Wingfield (Thewlis) has taken over and rules despotically; but he's quickly deposed and Smith put in charge.The Indian males are all fierce iron men in war paint at all times, so you wonder why Smith's hushed voiceovers go on about how peaceful and free and without guile or anger or suspicion they turn out to be, once you get to know them. Maybe teaching Pocahontas English has kept Smith from learning enough of the Indians' language to know what they're talking about  who knows? Malick cares about poetry, not logic. We know from a subtitled speech that King Powhatan suspects the white men are going to stay and multiply and sees this as a terrible threat he must deal with. But Smith remains, as depicted here, a believer in the noble savage -- just as he is a believer in the ""New Land's"" leading to equality and plenty and justice for all settlers.The voiceovers are a Malick mannerism already familiar from The Thin Red Line. Occasionally they reveal where the action on screen is tending, but mostly they pose general questions about life and love worthy of some teenager's diary, and they often risk sounding fatuous. They also may confuse the average viewer, since they're not conventional narration but go off on their own tangents at the most unexpected moments. This unpredictability is what appeals about Malick's film-making, but also what's maddening about it sometimes. Using many such voice-over voices might have helped achieve the failed promise of a portrait of the whole ""New World"" experience, the fate of the colony and the colonists, but that of course would be even more confusing for the average viewer.Eventually anyway we realize this is just a love story. It's not so much an epic one as a failed one: Pocahontas is robbed of Smith and has to settle for marrying the well-meaning and trustworthy tobacco grower, John Rolfe (Bale). It's a simple story, though with extreme cross-cultural aspects, including Pocahontas' successful trip to meet the king and queen of England, where she sees Smith again, and hears his regrets over abandoning her. Maybe he found his Indies and passed by them, he says. It's a nice moment, amid the rich formal garden of some noble English estate. And the last sequence narrated by Rolfe has some quick cuts that are quite thrilling. Malick can thrill you, but when it comes to telling a story he can seriously let you down. The mud and poetry is an ethereal mix this time, and it all seems to vanish into the English air.",The New World
42,PWNYCNY,Long boring movie.,5,9 April 2008,"This movie was nominated for an Academy Award? For what? For best movie for producing boredom? What a long ... drawn out ... ponderous ... pretentious ... piece of Hollywood pseudodocudrama. (Yawn) Oh, watching Captain Smith and Pocahontas doing touchy-feely while the whites and Indians are literally preparing to kill each other was extraordinarily underwhelming. The arrival of the English in 1607 was an important moment in history but as usual Hollywood reduces it to a mere historical backdrop for an improbable and ludicrous love story between a little Indian girl and bedraggled discredited Englishman who, with the rest of his group, were unwelcome guests on someone else's turf. What this movie fails to answer is: Why did this little girl love John Smith? According to the movie, Captain Smith had no leadership skills, was universally disliked, was a failure as a soldier and inspired scorn from amongst his peers. The actress who plays Pocahantas is cute but her acting skills need further development. She simply is not convincing in the role nor did she look the part. If you like long boring movies then this movie is for you.",The New World
43,iquine,"Life, Love, Culture & Challenges in the 1600s",8,14 December 2019,"(Flash Review)1609 is the year and three English ships find land. An insubordinate man, John Smith, gets taken by a Native American tribe and earns their trust and is kept alive to tell his English settlers they must leave at Spring. In the meantime, he finds love with the Indian chief's daughter, Pocahontas. Turns into a Romeo and Juliet situation where both groups remain adversarial. At this point the film contrasts the Native American honest and open and trusting society to that of the combative and distrusting English. Being a Terrence Malick directed film, the visuals and atmosphere are the primary communication vehicle and it does not apologize for that. Will Pocahontas and John Smith find a way to be together peacefully? Pocahontas does spend some time living in England and the film analyzes how she adapts to a new world. The beautiful visuals are accompanied by rising and falling hopeful instrumental music. Malick uses lots of handheld shots to accentuate the wide open lands to bring the viewer further into the films atmosphere. If you like Malick's style, you'll like this and if you don't like minimal dialog and sparse storytelling, this may not be for you. Through the DVD special features, I did learn that the film tried super hard to make the sets as true to period as possible and only used natural lighting.",The New World

45,noralee,A Mythic Exploration of a Clash of Civilizations,10,21 February 2006,"""The New World"" is a sophisticated and breathtaking look at a pivotal moment in history -- the meeting of English colonists with the native peoples of North America. Writer/director Terrence Malick tells a powerful story of mythic proportions through flesh-and-blood individuals. It is a doomed story of sights, sounds, contrasts, passions and miscommunication. The changes are powerfully and gradually shown, with minimal dialog, through the three-part story of the curiosity, bravery and adaptability of an extraordinary young woman. Where ""Thin Red Line"" looked at the relationship between war and the environment, here is the relationship between religion and the environment. This is a clash of gods, those communing with Mother Earth vs. those proclaiming service to Jesus Christ. This is a metaphorical retelling of Adam and Eve thrown out of Eden.In the pivotal, and primarily emotive, role of the conflicted, complicated John Smith, Colin Farrell is not just the preternatural rebel, but really uses his visceral masculinity. He scruffily comes off the water (a recurring image) in chains and is only saved from hanging for mutiny because his military skills are deemed essential by expedition leader Christopher Plummer. Plummer orders cutting all the trees around to build fortifications, initiating their environmental desecration. He sends Farrell off into the wilderness for trade before returning to England for supplies (I've read that his voice-over Manifest Destiny pontifications were added in the revision).What follows goes on a bit long like ""Dances with Wolves"" as Smith gradually finds his soul with the natives (his tattooed torso fits in with their colorful body displays) and falls in love with the chief's daughter (never called Pocahontas). We see their peaceful domestication of the environment with crops, fishing, families, homes, governing council -- though they do have weapons so it's not a pacifist idyll (the tribal issues are hard to follow, and it's not clear that briefly seen shaman Irene Bedard is her mother). He again gets saved from execution, legendarily by her, and is in effect reborn. Their time ""in the forest"" seems so unreal to him that in his narration of his thoughts he repeats ""I thought it was a dream."" This Edenic beauty makes his return to Jamestown that much more shocking as a gruesome ""Lord of the Flies"" society has erupted like an environmental original sin -- they have stripped the sea of fish and the land in a mad search for the gold of the Indies instead of tending crops. They are insane with religious fanaticism and internecine, murderous arguments with cruel neglect of even children. We see glimpses of character actors scarily effective in showing a miniature society gone to hell.Smith makes the fateful decision to side with his white brethren who are in such desperate, foolish need, even when they viciously reject his help and advice. Cassandra-like, he urges his native love ""don't trust me,"" seeing the future ruin of the natives though incapable of preventing it, letting the Chief think the colonists will leave.She remains tragically idealistic and hopeful, rejected by her father for helping the colonists. There is a confusing part two of their love story that duplicates the images of being free to be together in the wilderness, but not in either of their's civilization. He protests: ""Where would we live? In a tree top? In a hole in the ground?"" He rejects her, as well as the moral compromise of using her as a hostage when relations between the natives and settlers deteriorate from first random then wholesale violence. Her character matures; Farrell's does not, preferring her innocent and untouched by progress. He uses personal ambition, and even the religious strictures of Leviticus, as an excuse, leading to one of their few exchanges: ""Did you find your Indies, John?"" ""I think I went past it.""Q'Orianka Kilcher makes this work, miraculously for someone so young. She is not only emotionally expressive, has magical physical chemistry with Farrell and is explosive in grief and longing, but is also incredibly physically active as she changes from boundless barefoot freedom to the cautious confinement of corset and boots, and eventually conversion through baptism under a stream of water to emerge as ""Rebecca"". And she's beautiful. I saw the film twice to take in the characters' confusing trajectories, but both were Malick's revised version, which I've read cut the development of John Rolfe's (Christian Bale) patronizing, but loving, relationship in civilization with her (""You don't really know the meaning of the word marriage, do you?"" All she asks is ""Are you kind?""). I wanted to see more of their courtship within the manipulated agricultural environment instead of the repeat of her and Smith's sensual forest frolics. Where Smith guiltily thinks ""I am not the man you think I am,"" she moves on to Rolfe: ""You are the man I think you are."" Ironically, the cash crop the natives teach the colonists is killer tobacco.The closing visit to London is a striking contrast. The marvels of a busy city and the pomp of the Royal Court are not overwhelming but vignettes, like her sympathizing with a caged animal. What is creatively striking and deserving of the extended screen time is ""Rebecca"", and another native Wes Studi, strolling in formal and topiary gardens. This civilization's controlling mastery over nature is stultifyingly complete. Yet the resourceful young woman adapts, cartwheeling through the mowed grass, climbing a tree and playing with a child, briefly finding happiness.While Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography is gorgeous, the sound design and editing are magnificent, as the silences, natural sounds and man-made interruptions are used in tandem. James Horner's swelling score is his best ever, including bits from Wagner to native instrumentation and vocalization. But the music is carefully used for cultural emphasis around the ambient sounds, from the opening to the end of the closing credits. Stay through to hear the full effect.",The New World
46,kluseba,Slow paced documentary instead of a real movie,1,5 April 2010,"Well, first of all, I would like to tell you that I am really interested in history, especially the North American History. I'm a history and geographic teacher and I'm also learning innu-aimun and watch Inuit movies. When I read about this movie, I was kind of happy because this could have been my kind of film. Well, it wasn't it at all.The movie shows a lot of beautiful landscapes, offers some interesting costumes and historical stuff. The movie is like a documentary or a walk through a museum. But there is nothing that happens! The development of the story is very slow and there is no point of acceleration anywhere in the movie. There are almost no dialogues, instead of trying to develop the characters or to create an interesting story about a forbidden romance, the director prefers to show us some birds and trees. I don't get any approach to the characters and their story which should be the core of this movie. When I was watching this first I've almost fallen asleep many times, I was wachting the clock like very five minutes, but I'm a tough guy, so I wanted to finish the movie and hoped for an interesting ending, but it was all in vain. It's just a boring documentary without a real story, without interesting acting, without surprising elements in the story... just avoid to watch this! If you like the general topic of the movie, go ahead for ""Nouvelle-France"" or ""The last of the Mohicans"", but not for this one...",The New World
47,Kdosda_Hegen,A rare gem.,9,21 April 2021,"This film is visually stunning, it has amazing cinematography and its portrayal of nature is very well done. It runs for almost 3h (extended edition) and while being a very slow film it is captivating and never overstates its welcome. For the most part, the film is extremely beautiful, a great mixture of scenery, music, lighting and romance makes it a gorgeous soul-touching experience.It has very unusual storytelling, it's very straightforward, yet unfamiliar. It doesn't show many things and tells them instead, but at the same time, it likes to skip huge chunks of the timeline.Sadly, its greatness doesn't last forever since it takes some very weird turns. The last 20 minutes are questionable. It seems that this film turned from war romance into a period romance film in the end, kind of reminds me of The Notebook in a bad way.Still, even with the disappointing finale, the first 2,5h is a very artsy and lovely experience.",The New World

49,fertilecelluloid,Captivating film poem undercut by repetition,7,21 February 2006,"For the first hour I was captivated by the beautiful imagery (courtesy of Emmanuel Lubezki), the transporting score (by James Horner), the ace production design (by Jack Fisk, the director of ""Raggedy Man"") and Terrence Malick's delicate handling of the film's key relationship between Colin Farrell (John Smith) and Q'Orianka Kilcher (Rebecca). We are drawn into the world of the ""Naturals"" (the first Indians encountered by the British) and lulled, as was Smith, into a reality that was destined to change.As the Smith/Rebecca relationship changes, so does the relationship between the British and the Indians. The result is brutal conflict, and these sequences, shot in a style similar to ""The Thin Red Line"", are stunningly choreographed. They are also tragic for they depict the beginning of a culture's destruction.After Farrelly disappears from the scene, the melancholy Rebecca is courted by John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a kind Brit who is sensitive to her grief. Though they sire an offspring, the native woman's joy is extinguished by a revelation that sends her emotions into a spin.""The New World"" is a rumination on love and loss, of a culture, of individuals. It is narrated by the key characters and structured like a poem. Malick's forte is using imagery of the natural and not-so-natural world as metaphor for the characters' shifting, troubled emotions.For mine, the film is too long, and some of the narrative content is repeated again and again. Kilcher is an extraordinarily beautiful, natural presence, and her Rebecca, the film's center, is compelling. Farrell is a muscular dramatic persona and conveys his conflicted loyalties faithfully. Christian Bale, always believable, does what he can with a mostly one-note role.The film lingers like dew on morning grass, but it is overinflated with its own self-importance and would have been more effective if trimmed of its clearly much-loved fat.",The New World

Of course when you have characters named Captain Smith & Rolfe & Pocahontas, we have romance. Colin Farrel & Christian Bale are fine as our heroes, , The actress who portrays teen age Pocahontas looks much too old to do proper justice to the part, She does a good job however.

51,aharmas,Lovely Reflection on Human Nature,10,26 December 2005,"It broke my heart to see how a few patrons walked out of this film without giving themselves a chance to experience one of the most intense and transcendental experiences of a lifetime. This film reaches beyond what words can say and truly forces one to look inwards and connect back with worlds that don't exist anymore.There is a purity to the beauty and intensity of the feelings Mallick has managed to convey in his storytelling. There is no much dialogue, and at times the film appears to move very slowly; this is what appears to be problematic for a few members of the audience. It is as if action has to be symbolized by outburst of special effects and inane dialogue where a simple look or a gorgeous depiction of how we are one with nature suffices. The film uses plenty of symbols to show how we are one with this world; whether it is new or old. How mother nature must feel neglected by our decisions to embrace modern technology, or the latest novelty of whatever type it must be.It would be incorrect to call the film simple because it is a very complex and meditative look at how our world and our lives change. Through the eyes of a very intelligent and perceptive man, we are exposed to places our souls rarely encounter. There is direct power to the images in the movie: the flow of the water, the clouds in the sky, the dance of the smoke, the visceral moves of the various human beings. In ""The New World"" an embrace, a look, a slight touch carry endless and powerful meanings to the people in and off the screen. The audience is carried along and should be able to tremble with the passion and tenderness the movie's protagonists experience. Without reservations, all the film's principals do an outstanding jobs in their respective roles: Christopher Plummer, as the wise captain who truly understands what it means to see a new civilization. His choice of words says much about what he has encountered in Virginia, as he calls the local people, ""naturals"". John Smith is played quietly and with much insight by Colin Farrell, an actor who can do marvelous work in quality films. His tortured adventurer is man who doesn't belong in his century, as he able to see beyond what lies before him, but he is also unable to comprehend the power of what surrounds him. In a second masterful turn this year, Christian Bale proves himself a very competent actor, as the introspective soul who doesn't want to change destiny but goes along with fate, whether this could mean more sadness or his desired happiness. He is superb this time out.Yet, the film belongs to a newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, giving a performance as lovely, complex, and as magnificent as anything some of our greatest actresses have done. Her expressive eyes are the link between the soul of man and the essence of nature. Her physical gestures reflect on how her world is adapting to the new forces that are now intruding upon it. Her love scenes are some of the most beautiful and romantic ever put on screen, intense because of their purity. There is no wasted dialogue, no overblown musical score pushing the inability of a less capable director, nothing else is needed but a close up of a young woman who tells us how amazing humanity can be.Throughout the film, there are several moments where the audience can't help but gasping at how far we have departed from what we truly are. Nothing rings false in here, as we see how far our feelings can carry us. There is such a range from the generosity of several of the characters in the film, to the fear and despair some of the first arrivals had to go through.Much is to be praised about its technical aspects as well, in particular about the gorgeous score by James Horner and the unbelievably beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezky. Jack Fisk's and Jacqueline West's art direction and costume design were truly inspired, and the great screenplay by Mr. Malick should be studied by those who want to explore, discover, and understand how a true master of cinema works to produce a lovely canvas.I could go and on, praising this superb film; however it is not fair for me to tell you what it is. It is for you to go and discover its pleasures as your senses are enveloped by the experience.",The New World
52,Agent10,A beautiful viewing experience,10,21 January 2006,"It takes little knowledge to understand the future impact a film like this will leave behind. While many people feel the movie is rather pointless in it's scope, the juxtaposition of images, voices and music will create a visual experience that will be hard to equal any time soon. While film school students strive to be the next big thing in cinema, people like Terrence Malick make films that turn the industry on its head and makes them take a hard look at the product they create.The New World by all accounts is an amazing film. The depth of space and detail made the extra cost of using 65mm film all the more worthwhile. Subtle details and colors that seem devoid in most 35mm films indicate the artistry and scope the filmmakers put into this film, making us forget about the complexities of the modern world. The film grabs you right out of the gate, from the first moments of John Smith's Christ-like imprisonment to the last beautiful shots, it leaves one to guess why Malick isn't more prolific in his films.This film also leaves a deep impression of good and evil, once again falling quite nicely into Malick's need to juxtapose the frailties of good with the savagery of evil. While ad campaigns try to pass this off as some cheap Titanic knock-off just to sell a few tickets, don't believe it.This is a one of a kind film, comparable only to The Thin Red Line, and years from now, the lucky few who watched the film in theaters will carry fond memories.",The New World
53,ShootingShark,"Handsome, Entrancing Version Of The Pocahontas-John Smith Love Story",6,18 October 2010,"John Smith is an explorer helping establish the colony of Jamestown in Virginia in 1607 who falls in love with Pocahontas, a native girl. As tensions between the settlers and the tribespeople rise Pocahontas renounces her past, but is Smith sincere in his intentions ?For such a famous tale from American history and mythology, the Pocahontas / Matoaka story has been filmed only a few times, most notably the 1995 Disney animated feature. This is a beautiful, definitive version of the legend of an American Indian girl who saved the colonists' lives, acted as peacemaker, married an English tobacco farmer, and was an honoured guest of King James at Hampton Court Palace. As with Malick's other movies, it's a gorgeous, dreamy, extraordinarily sensory banquet - true cinema - where the images and sounds are more important than anything else. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera lingers sensuously on the grasslands, forests and inlets, while the actors embody their characters more in how they move through the landscape than what they do or say. I love all this stuff; few directors dare to tell a story so languidly, with minimal dialogue and so much screen time devoted to creating the atmosphere of a physical location (it was shot on the Chickahominy River near to the real events). At the same time it has the same liabilities as Malick's other work - woolly plotting, narcissistic leading men and occasional listless scenes - but it's so consistently jaw-droppingly beautiful that who cares ? The music is equally inspiring and resonant - a mixture of James Horner's symphonic score and deftly orchestrated source music (particularly the prelude from Wagner's Das Rheingold, which is also used to great effect in Werner Herzog's oddly similar Nosferatu). In some ways the cast play second fiddle - much of the time all they are required to do is look morose or hug each other - but they look just the part and they give it their all, particularly the fourteen-year-old Kilcher (an American of Peruvian-Swiss descent) who is expressive, haunted and delivers a mature performance well beyond her years. I tend not to like too many critically acclaimed directors but Malick is a definite exception - nobody sees the physical world quite the same way he does and his rare forays into filmmaking (this one only took seven years, positively rushed by his standards) are always breathtaking and exceptional. Here he serves up a moving, thought-provoking, passionate slice of history, shot through with drama, authenticity and outstanding imagery. Trivia - King James and Queen Anne are played by Jonathan Pryce and Malick's wife Alexandra.",The New World
54,davidmvining,Beautiful and crushing,10,20 October 2020,"For about the last thirty minutes of Terrence Malick's The New World, I'm a mess. The emotional connection that Malick creates between me, the audience, and his characters is so complete that the final emotional motions that the princess Pocahontas goes through as she finishes out her story affect me at levels I find very rare in film. On top of that, the production is so intricate, the editing so evocative, and the performances so restrained but emotional that I find the mass audience resistance to The New World both completely flabbergasting and entirely understandable. This is an art film, for sure, but it works just so very well.This movie is about the story of Pocahontas and John Smith much the same way that The Thin Red Line is about the Battle of Guadalcanal. In other words, not really. Yes, Pocahontas is the main character, John Smith and John Rolfe play large supporting roles, and we witness the early clash of civilizations around the founding and formative years of Jamestown, but they're window dressing to the actual story Terrence Malick was trying to tell which is about the loss of innocence, or, to put it in an idiom that more closely aligns with his overall thematic obsessions, it's about the expulsion from paradise, from Eden.I've read critiques, intelligent critiques, mind you, of The New World that talk about how Malick over-idealizes the natives, or the naturals as the English call them in the film, of 1607 Virginia, but I feel like that's missing the point. There's a larger thematic point about the effervescent nature of utopia on Earth, but there's also a character point. When John Smith is allowed to live by his native captors, he's put in the hands of Pocahontas, a fourteen year old girl who sees nothing around her but nature, which she calls Mother, in all its glory. She's almost a sprite in a certain way where she moves with the wind and the water around her. She acts as Smith's translator and view into the world of the natives, and because his lens is built a certain way he fails to see the more realistic side of the naturals.There's a moment as Smith is brought into the longhouse, ready for judgment and death, when, in the corner of the frame, a warrior handles a human hand cut from its arm. We also see other examples of the natives desiring possessions like a copper kettle that conflicts with his voiceover statements while he was in his own personal Eden when he said that they had no sense of possession. His sense of utopia is built on perception, but like the treehouse in Badlands or the village in The Thin Red Line, this utopia is of the world and contains the seeds of its own destruction.So, the English arrive in Virginia and set up a colony, and we can see the normal progression of plot familiar to the Pocahontas story. Smith gets captured and saved. The English nearly starve in the winter. Pocahontas brings them food to keep them from starving. Smith goes away, Rolfe shows up, Rolfe and Pocahontas marry, and they go to England where Pocahontas dies. The movie isn't that terribly interested in the details of the stories on their own. Every event is used as a vehicle for Malick's thematic ideas as carried through by his characters. We don't need films to act as our history textbooks, so Malick using the Pocahontas story to explore his own ideas is a wonderful fit.One of the interesting things about the film's structure is that up until a little over the halfway point, John Smith is by far the most central of characters. We mostly see Pocahontas through his eyes, getting smaller moments away from him for her here and there, but it makes sense when you see what Malick is trying to do. Smith is the one who discovers and experiences that new innocence and paradise on Earth when he arrives in America. He loses it before Pocahontas does, and when he's called away by the king to look for a north passage to the Indies, it's her turn to feel like everything is lost.Not only has Pocahontas been cast out from her tribe, but now she's left along among strangers with strange ways in a place that had been her home but now no longer looks like it. Instead of the forest, she lives in a house. When she receives the false information that Smith has died, she has literally nothing left. Her entire world has been taken from her. What does she end up doing? She ends up moving forward. She gets a servant woman, Mary, who helps her learn how to read and write. John Rolfe appears and courts her to the point of marriage. She rebuilds as a new woman in a new world. The first time she smiles and chases after some flying insects on her tobacco farm with Rolfe, it's a marvelous moment. She feels like she's finally becoming alive again.The final section of the film deals with Pocahontas going to England with Rolfe and their son. It's here that the movie fully embraces the idea of the new world, especially in how we also follow Opechancanough who goes to count the white men and find this God that the English are always talking about. The wilds of America were beautiful and untamed, but the gardens and cathedrals of England contain their own awe inspiring beauty for the newly arrived man. It's also here that Pocahontas, now called Rebecca, meets John Smith again, and this heartbreaking scene is the core of the film.Smith still clings to the paradise he knew with her years before, but she finds that she's become detached from the same place. Smith has nothing else, feeling like he's talking to her for the first time, but Pocahontas is able to see beyond it, beyond the dream. She has a loving husband and a small son, both of whom are very real and very present, and that's what she can cling to. She has something real, but all Smith has is a dream. And even then, Malick gives us her final spiritual moments as she dances around a rich English country estate in her full gown as though she were just the same sprite from the beginning. She's still the same woman, but fuller now that she's found something real to cling onto.When I first started writing about movies on the Internet, I formalized my thinking on how all stories are built. They consist of four major elements: character, plot, style, and theme. Every story has all four in different amounts, and every audience member has a preference, though they may not be able to vocalize it this way. Malick's films are heavily stylized, for sure, but they have very firm foundations in character and theme. Plot is incidental to his moviemaking, but for many, I think most, filmgoers, plot is the single most important element of storytelling to them. When they encounter a film that has no plot, they think there's no story or that nothing's happening, and they disengage. I find this unfortunate because someone like Malick is telling stories, just in a different way than many people expect. Opening up to someone like Malick can lead to rapturous experiences like every time I watch The New World. Malick may have a process that almost no one else can get their minds around (stories of Malick pissing off actors, directors of photography, and even composers are kind of the stuff of legend), but his end products show an artist in full command of his art, even if his methods are far from traditional.The New World is a work of art. It's one of my favorite films. It hits me emotionally like very few films can. It is the work of a visionary and a genius. I adore this film.",The New World
55,nycritic,The Tragedy of Time Lost,1,26 May 2006,"Terence Malick and Michael Cimino should join forces, discuss fantastic, labyrinthine, Quixotic tales they've been spinning in their uber-artistic minds floating somewhere out in Pluto, buy 1,000,000 miles of film (or all the digital camcorders in the world, providing they've embraced the present century and want to make sure they have enough tools to work with), assemble an preposterous cast consisting of every major and minor working actor or actress (and why not, even a couple of skin actors thrown in for fun), get two newcomers to star, and start filming without any concern for the plot or characters or dialogue until what they have is the Tower of Babel of movies, a behemoth so unbelievable in size and scope that it would take 20 years to view in its entirety and would make Cecil B. DeMille's epics seems like 1 minute shorts.How is it possible to fail so portentously? And this isn't even pretend fail, it's not the kind of you can dismiss -- this is a major train wreck with no survivors, it's failure with a capital F emblazoned in shining red letters over Times Square in front of the Marriott Marquis. It's the kind that needs to be studied under a microscope to see if it's contagious.Whatever happened to making coherent movies that actually bothered to tell a story and not condescend to the audience in having them look at this thing loosely called a movie with the wide eyes of someone whose never seen moving images on screen? It starts out well -- the arrival of the ships to American shore, the almost hyper-reality that paints a land, untouched, and the quiet appearance of the ""Naturals"" (a fancy word for the less PC ""Indians"").It's just that after the first oh, fifteen minutes, which introduce this mangled, unedited mess, are over, it becomes an exercise in sheer tedium. There is no actual dialogue for the longest time, and the presences of Christopher Plummer -- among a roster of big name actors, all British -- never make more than a vague impression. It's like watching a Seurat painting up close -- everything becomes blurred beyond recognition. It doesn't matter, anyhow -- they're gone before anyone can register they've been there filling up screen time.Later on, the movie meanders like many of its dainty creeks and streams, showing how John Smith insinuates himself as a member of the Natural's tribe, how he becomes the object of love from the never named Pocahontas (even though she's little more than 12 years old). This is one of the worst exercises in poetics I've seen in a long time. Both characters endlessly warble sweet nothings to each other off-screen as they run through the forests, cavort through the meadows, look longingly at each other, and let the nature envelop them like a nightmarish angora sweater. Battles ensue, people get killed, the Naturals make their violent nature known, Pocahontas gets disowned, Smith disappears, and nary a word of actual dialogue is heard for eternal spaces unless it's to enunciate something of vague meaning, and even then, it's filled with portent and gravitas. So much, it's a wonder the movie doesn't collapse by the sheer force of weight.And on and on it goes, where it stops, nobody knows. I noticed how time began to slip through my fingers, how my apartment began to smell like sour milk, rampant dejection, and dog-hair. The Discovery Channel would have had a field day analyzing the level of abandonment I had thrown it in. I noticed that my perfectly shaved head was all of a sudden sprouting a scraggly mane like crabgrass. I was dimly aware that my bones were aching, my muscles were cramping, my bowels were roaring -- at least faster than this movie was. And then it occurred to me: I was getting old. I was losing my looks. I was becoming Methuselah with body odor so strong it could be used as a weapon of mass destruction.Until finally, like manna from heaven, Christian Bale appeared. I figured, he looks like Jesus: is he here to Save Me? He's a whiff of fresh air, a scent of Clean Linen courtesy of Hallmark candles, Archangel Michael in the flesh. But no... I was aware I had 45 more minutes to go, so he morphed into a mirage of water in an endless desert: he, too, began chirping sweet nothings to Pocahontas as she looked unto the sky, opened her hands, and called out to her mother, the Being of All Things. It was then when I shot myself.It wasn't that bad, actually. I didn't die, so I figured God had a purpose left for me in this Earth that had since seen the Passing of Time, the End of an Era. So I got up, made some coffee, made sure it was extra charged, listened to more incomprehensible warbles, was aware of a thickness in the air and realized Summer was finally here, and when I came back, Pocahontas had croaked, the movie was over -- but not over. It had more scenery. And more. And even more. And, surprise-surprise, More. I then found my inner rage, embraced my indignity, grabbed the remote, yanked the DVD out, and shrieked: ""Stick a fork in me -- I am done!"" And regained control of my life that had been irrevocably lost for those nine centuries I remained captive under Malick's druggy visuals.Anyone coming into this movie, either because of curiosity, Colin Farrell, or watching an underage girl who looks like the spawn of Ali McGraw and Joseph Gordon-Hewitt traipse across an expanse of woods and streams as if she was perpetually re-discovering, and surprised at their very existence would have a more entertaining time reading the article on Wikipedia. It's long. But actually, quite exciting.",The New World
56,valadas,Only love is real,7,28 June 2006,"Q'Orianka Kilcher in the role of the young Indian Princess Pocahontas ""is"" the movie. From the first to the last image she captivates us with her presence, her smile, her pure and sweet look, her words and last but not least her deep inner thoughts that we hear through her off voice. All the other characters are mere counterpoints of her acting which deeply fulfills our sight and our hearts and minds. I don't care if the movie respects truly the biography of Pocahontas which is itself full of less clear aspects as far as you know nowadays. Artistic freedom allows some creative liberties in that field providing they don't adulterate the essential truth which this movie doesn't. Besides the main theme which is the princess herself and her love story with a British captain, we are allowed to watch enough of the clash between the world of the British soldiers and settlers and the Indians living and owning that part of the New World of which they finished by being dispossessed violently as we all know. One final note that is also a key to understand this movie better: Captain Smith in the end admits that after all the true reality was made up by the love hours he had spent with Pocahontas in the forest in the beginning of the movie and nothing else. Love scenes shown here in very chaste images (we hardly see a lips to lips kiss) sparing us the sight of breasts and other anatomic delicacies which sometimes don't add anything to the meaning of the scenes and are totally gratuitous.",The New World
57,Foutainoflife,This Is A Love/Hate Movie,7,9 February 2019,"This is a difficult movie to review. I love the story. I hate how it was filmed. This is one of the slowest movies I have ever seen. I can handle most slow moving films but this one is above all others. It isn't that the film isn't beautifully filmed because it is. It's biggest problem is there really isn't much dialogue and it seemed as if the long, drawn out moments depicting falling in love and being one with nature was more important than anything else.These scenes were shot nicely. Beautiful rays of light, a hand gliding over blades of grass and even moments of being cleansed with smoke all had an almost mesmerizing and dreamy look to them. It was artistic but drawn out to the point of boredom.Another issue for me was the narration. The majority of the narration was meant to serve as the character's internal dialogue. I would've liked to have seen more dialogue between characters rather than just the internal dialogue of one.Lastly this movie was three hours long. It was a long three hours because there wasn't enough going on to keep you tuned in. It just wasn't engaging.I've seen where some folks are of the opinion that if you don't enjoy it then you are not a true connoisseur of cinema but rather you are simply someone watching a movie. To that all I have to say is ""Really?"". What a pretentious thing to say!Here's the bottom line. This film is three hours long. It has very little dialogue. It has beautifully shot but extremely long and numerous scenes meant to express a closeness with nature and falling in love. The story is nice but you have to go through all those long scenes to get it. I give it 6.5 stars.",The New World
58,MartianOctocretr5,"Fine aesthetics and artistry, slow story",7,3 June 2007,"This movie is a faithful retelling of the Pocahontas biography, boasting some beautiful scenery, sincere acting, well executed point of view camera shots, and sympathetic characterizations. Its only notable weakness is a story that moves slowly in places.Q'Oriana Kilcher is a genuine and appealing Pocahontas, personifying a sense of wonder with life and appreciation of nature that is immediately endearing. Colin Farell, as Captain Smith also does well, and they enact a gently understated yet passionate ""first love"" romance which is believable and sweet. The story poignantly outlines how the legendary couple were caught in the middle of racial tension and victimized by events beyond their control. Most photography is done with at eye level, from a character's point of view. This is done in most of the movie, and works particularly well in a battle scene; you see a combatant's view from the middle of the bloody skirmish. I also like the narration by characters telling their own feelings of the events transpiring, sounding much like the recollections of a person reliving the experience as they make a diary entry.However, the movie endeavors too hard to tell the whole story, sometimes burdening itself with an abundance of superfluous details. Even minor characters are developed well, sometimes more than necessary to plot development. The result is that the action tends to lag occasionally.Overall, however, a visually pleasing movie, which makes a well intentioned effort to portray Pocahontas and Smith as very real and human.",The New World
59,Cosmoeticadotcom,Great,10,19 September 2008,"Terrence Malick is simply the greatest living American filmmaker. Only Stanley Kubrick was his equal or superior. That's not to say that Martin Scorsese nor Woody Allen have not made great films, but they've both made stinkers in their careers, and neither has had a great film in over a decade (although I've heard good things about Allen's current Match Point). Not only is Malick the best filmmaker in the nation, despite The New World being only his 4th film in the 33 years since his first, Badlands, was released, but he may be the only filmmaker in the world who truly has developed his own cinematic language- apart from a reliance on the written words of a screenplay to carry the bulk of the film's art and story. He is also the greatest American historian in the cinematic art form. It's his forté alone.Better still, he never condescends in his films. He presents his tales sparely, with cinematography, enough dialogue to convey the scene, and occasional voiceovers that play off the visuals and imagery to leave a poetic dissonance in the viewer's mind that the mind is forced to fill in the synapse with its own meaning, thus creating narrative from symbols, visuals, and their interplay. It truly is a different and new form of screen writing; and a great form, one wholly enmeshed in the medium that birthed it. What makes it great are not the words, but their relation to what is on the screen. Simple declarative and/or descriptive sentences, such as Smith's descriptions of Pocahontas, 'She exceeded the others not only in beauty and proportion, but in wit and spirit, too,' or Rolfe's ideas about her, 'When first I saw her, she was regarded as someone broken, lost,' transcend Shakespearean depth in this new medium, and in centuries hence Terrence Malick will get his due as one of the giants of the 'early', first century of human cinema.The actual meat of this film is the by now almost fabular tale of John Smith (Colin Farrell) and his 'love'- Pocahontas (although that name is never used in the film)- during the settling of Jamestown by Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) and his charges. All the familiar facts are presented- he is captured by her tribe, her father, Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg), releases him when she saves him from death. He grows to respect the Indians, returns to Jamestown, abandons her when she is outcast by her father for supposedly betraying her people by feeding the English during the winter, then giving them seeds to grow crops, and she ends up marrying John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a kind widower whose son has also died, taking the Christian name Rebecca, giving him another son, and wowing the English court.If film can achieve sheer apports with its art, then Terrence Malick is the lone levitator and magician around. The only minor negative point in this film, and it's very minor, is that as well-done as the voiceovers are the film might have been better off without them, for some of the poetic statements of Smith, Rolfe, and Pocahontas seem a bit over the heads of their 17th Century low born utterers- unlike those in his earlier films. Of all the films that are getting Oscar buzz- from worthy films like Capote and Shopgirl, to blatantly PC fodder like Brokeback Mountain, this is- easily- the best film that last year produced. Yet, it will only get some cinematography, editing, scoring, or other minor nods.There is a ritualistic feel to this film that glues one's eyes to it, from its sublime opening to its choral ending shot of New World trees reaching sunward, even to its non-standard non-black screen credits at the end. This is not a film, but an experience, and that is not me trying to sound poetic, but really defining the film. See it, then get the DVDs of his earlier films and see that real, great art still exists. Then, if you want to go back to crap after that, I'm sure Spielberg will have another clunker ready in a few months. People like him always do. Yet, it'll probably be another decade before we get a Malick masterpiece. Sigh.",The New World
60,brchthethird,A slow and contemplative meditation,7,12 January 2015,"For my second Terrence Malick film (and there aren't too many), I have chosen THE NEW WORLD. It's basically the story of Pocahontas, starting from the settlement of Jamestown when she met John Smith to her later life when she married John Rolfe and moved to England. Of course, being that this is Terrence Malick, the minutiae of historical details aren't really adhered to and the story is told in rather broad strokes, making sure to hit all of the important historical moments but generally being a slower and more contemplative meditation on the themes that its director is interested in. While I was perfectly fine with the abstract story in THE TREE OF LIFE, I felt that it didn't quite work as well here. Still, Malick has crafted a stunningly beautiful film that explores themes of discovery, conflict, the search for happiness, and making the most out of difficult situations. What I thought worked very well was a restrained use of voice-over that served as internal monologues. Absent a lot of dialogue, this provided an essential window into the various characters. I also loved the numerous shots of natural beauty which were expertly captured by Malick's frequent cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a really good performance, although the cast was subordinate to the imagery. The score was also excellent, and in particular I liked the simple piano theme that played when John Smith and Pocahontas were on screen together. However, despite all of this really positive stuff I do think that the film dragged a bit in places and I found my mind wandering somewhat. I suppose it would have helped if this wasn't a story based in historical fact. That way I wouldn't have had expectations about how it should have been presented. Honestly, I would have a preferred a more straightforward telling, but what I got wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. Overall, this is a technically superb film that has some interesting observations on life, but it did subvert my expectations a little bit.",The New World
61,vitaleralphlouis,Terence Malick Fails Once Again.,6,14 May 2006,"Although NEW WORLD is a refreshing change from the low grade trash Hollywood has dished-out the past two years, other people's failures don't make this a good picture. There's is, nonetheless, a lot of good things in this movie; which at least tries to give an accurate picture of early American history. We also have an Academy Award level portrayal by the girl playing Pocahontas. Absurdly sparse dialog is sometimes sharply effective. For example, Pocahontas' last few words with Captain John Smith. But there's no way of getting around the sheer lack of realistic emotion by most players: When food arrives at a time when the colony is starving, nobody raises their voice or shows any other excitement. Same in the battle scenes. Nobody shouts, let alone talks. Nobody says, Here come the Indians, or Watch Out, or anything.",The New World
62,fwomp,Strolling Through Nuance Rather Than In-Your-Face Action,6,29 May 2006,"The New World has many detractors. Most comment on the slow pace of the film, and this is undeniably so. ""It's like watching grass grow"" is the commonly heard cliché. I'm not here to defend the speed at which this story unfolds; it IS slow. But it's also beautifully put together.Try this: You're in a raft on a placidly flowing river. Trees wash by, animals nibble grasses on the shores, the sky illuminates a beautiful blue above and below while the sun warms your legs. The rapids are few and easily navigated, allowing you time to view everything around you. Sound boring? Or comfortable? If this sounds like death, stay away from The New World. If it sounds pleasant and enjoyable, give the film a try.What I enjoyed was the how the story dribbled into the viewer's lap. It roiled around you like a cool mountain stream and allowed time for everything to come into focus. This isn't Disney's Pocahontas; this is how the Jamestown Settlement came to be, in all its boringness and beauty.Colin Farrell stars as Captain John Smith, one of the founders of the original colonies. He and his shipmates arrive in the Americas and are soon building a fort while the leader of the group, Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer), heads back to Europe to resupply and bring more colonists.Meanwhile, Jamestown is nearly overrun by disease, power struggles, and the native Indians. Amidst all this, Captain Smith meets up with Pocahontas, the pretty and inquisitive daughter of a local chieftain. It is her generosity that allows these first colonists to survive, and it is mainly because of her love for Smith.After Captain Smith leaves the colony in search of better lands up north, it is wrongly reported to Pocahontas that her love perished in a shipping accident. Thus she despairs and eventually falls for John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a tobacco farmer.Pocahontas is later requested by the King and Queen of England to come to Court and meet them and she does. Thus, we have TWO new worlds being discovered: one for the Europeans (America), and one for the Native Americans (England and Europe).Pocahontas later learns that Captain Smith is still alive. It is a bitter realization and she has to decide whom to stay with, Smith or Rolfe.It is the beautiful cinematography of The New World that really pulls the viewer in. Some have complained that it should have won Best Cinematography at the Oscars and not Memoirs of a Geisha. I disagree. The New World is extremely beautiful to watch, no doubt, but I feel Memoirs of a Geisha was a bit better on the eyes.The wondrous musical score was another boon for the film. Surrounding the viewer/listener in an emulsion of color and sound, the music made for some powerful moments. Terrence Malick, Director, knows how to engage an audience. But it's not going to capture all those who watch it.In a society where action sells better than art, this film will be lost to many. Don't get me wrong, I love action films just as much as anyone. But it's not a necessary ingredient for a movie such as this. The authenticity (as seen on the DVD's extra features) will astound many; I know it blew me away. The re-creation of the settlement, the Native American huts, the battle gear, etc, are all pulled from archaeological records and sources. Impressive.It's also noteworthy to mention how little dialogue there is in the film. Terrence Malick prefers to let the scenes speak for themselves rather than have actors and actresses voices spoil the moment.I guess what it boils down to is this: If you don't like art films that focus on nuance rather than specifics, stay away from The New World. But if you don't mind letting your mind meander through a burbling set of scenes, you'll probably delight in this film.",The New World
63,TOMASBBloodhound,"For better or worse, Malick does it his way.",8,11 March 2007,"If nothing else, at least The Hound can now say he's seen a film with Colin Farrell in it. And for the record, he isn't bad. His John Smith pretty much stands around and gives the camera a forlorn look or chases Pocahontas around in the tall grass. There are worse ways to spend your time, I guess.Love him or leave him, Terrence Malick makes pictures on his own terms and for that reason alone he must be respected. Never mind the fact that his films are never commercially successful. Those expecting an exciting epic along the lines of Last of the Mohicans will be disappointed. There is a battle scene or two, but the action is neither graphic, nor terribly compelling. The real story here is the discovery of different cultures by both Native Americans and English settlers. We see what happens when the English land at Virginia in 1607 and encounter the local natives. You'd have to think that scene where the two sides first meet in that field would have been pretty accurate. It's hard to imagine how odd each group would have seemed to the other. Anyway, before too long, the ""Naturals"" are out to rid themselves of the white settlers, but the romance between the chief's daughter (Pocahontas) and Captain John Smith (Farrell) muddies the waters considerably.For the record, I liked the film. It is like other Malick films in terms of structure. The narrative takes a back seat to the scenery and mood of the film. The scenery, as one usually gets with Malick, is exceptional. Nearly every shot is at eye-level and has a large object or expanse of nature in the background. James Horner's score is subtle in some places, then overwhelming in others. Farrell isn't asked to do all that much as Smith, but he won't disappoint you. Christian Bale who comes on the scene later on is a much more developed character, and you will be glad he's there. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher is a site to behold. She is such a beautiful young woman that sometimes she even outshines the scenery around her. She was a perfect casting choice, and actually shows she can act, too! The verdict: A good film, but the 150 minute version is just too long. Some of the shots of the actors wandering around in nature just get redundant, but not necessarily unpleasant. If the film had been edited down to around 90 minutes like Days of Heaven, then it might have worked better. The New World is still a considerable cut above The Thin Red Line, however. The existentialism and voice overs just didn't work with the war setting.I would recommend this film, but be warned: Do not forget to pack your attention spans! The casual viewer will probably be bored stiff.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The New World
64,Holt344,"My review on the extended cut of The New World, a philosophical and realistic take on the story",9,18 April 2021,"The New World is written and directed by Terrence Malick, who is a magnificent filmmaker and he captured the story perfectly. Whilst the extended cut is 3 hours long and possibly unneeded, I appreciate and really like the director's preferred version. There's a whole hour of extra material for the film and it adds a lot of character development and beautiful shots. Also giving us a more fleshed out story, plus a better character study on the characters of Pocahontas and the two love interests.The film depicts the founding of Jamestown, Virginia. It also tells the life story of Pocahontas of the Powhatan tribe and the historical figures Captain John Smith and Englishman John Rolfe who played a big part of her life when they arrived by ship to Virginia. The film and story moves in a very slow pace, showing the inner thoughts and state of mind of the three characters. The philosophical dialogues and voice overs can be too much for certain people but I liked it, Terrence's dialogue and attention to detail in making everything authentic and realistic was a nice touch.Q'orianka Kilcher's performance is the best, she's truly terrific as Pocahontas. Colin Farrell plays John Smith whilst Christian Bale plays John Rolfe. The supporting cast includes well known actors, the casting was done so well.Beautifully filmed and the imagery flows so well with the voice over of Pocahontas, Smith and Rolfe's thoughts, being philosophical and poetic, the cinematography is some of the best I've seen and I have to say that the director's vision are perfect and I'm glad he got to release his version as it is one of the best films I have seen. Emmanuel Lubezki is a brilliant cinematographer that won 3 Oscars after this film, he should have won it for this one too. It's on the same level as The Revenant, or close to it. The use of natural lightning is his strong point, it's groundbreaking. James Horner musical soundtrack is amazing that fits the times perfectly, it among of other things make The New World into a very immersive film.From what I have read about these events and historical figures, I would say that this adaption is realistic and written with authenticity in mind. It's truly an incredible movie, but the entertainment value isn't very high. The extreme slow pacing can be tiresome, I get that. Your opinion can be different and that's alright, but my opinion is that The New World is a masterpiece.",The New World

The film shows their relationship and also the conflicts and differences between the Europeans and the Native Americans. The film also shows Pocahontas's relationship with an aristocrat named John Rolfe as well. The entire film is shown in her point of view. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Breakthrough Performance By An Actress (Q'Orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas) at The National Board Of Review. The New World is a very well made film. It's direction is good a long with performances, original music, cinematography, art direction, set decoration, costumes and makeup. But unfortunately the film itself is very slow moving and it gets to the point where it almost becomes boring. The film's director Terrence Malick is known for having gorgeous looking movies and this movie does look gorgeous and is very well made by the cast and crew. The film's script and pacing needed work however. Other than being a visual treat for the mind there was little else to enjoy about the film. The characters needed to have more going on and there needed to be a little more action or conflict in the film. I don't mind films with a slower pace that have a good story to it, but there is relatively no real concrete story here. Another problem I had with the film was I had a lot of trouble understanding what the actors were saying a lot of the time and that didn't help with the film either. I will give The New World a mild recommendation for it's look and the way it was so masterfully done, but as a film meant to entertain and provoke interest this film fails on that level. I do hope however that Terrence Malick begins work on another film soon because he is a gifted director with a great eye who just needs a better script the next time around.",The New World

67,gregsrants,How can history be soooo boring?,4,22 January 2006,"My guess is that most people have not heard of Terrence Malick. Outside of film enthusiasts and those people on the Ken Jennings side of the Trivial Pursuit knowledge belt, Malick is a name that isn't as well known as say a Scorsese or an M. Night. Hell, I would even venture that Michael Bay's name would illicit more recognition on the street than Mr. Malick. But hell, when you release only five films in thirty five years, what can we expect.That's right. I'll write it again just in case the numbers got lost on you the first time. Five Films. Thirty-five years. Look it up. I'll wait.Lanton Mills, Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line and now, The New World. It's a simple resume, yet Malick is considered one of the more revered directors on the film circuit. Personally, I could never understand why and with the The New World now out in theatres, I am bewildered even further.The New World is the story of Pocahontas - the version that isn't a Disney animated feature that had Mel Gibson prancing around in full Technicolor. Pocahontas is played by fairly newbee Q'Onraka Kilcher and follows her from when her tribe first meets the English settlers who land in Virginia in hopes of setting up a new colony. Pocahontas is particularly interested in John Smith (Colin Farrell) after she pleads for his life from her father  the leader of the tribe. Spared, John begins to teach her English and the two soon form a bond and a relationship that teases us for nearly 90 minutes before ending in an even more disappointing fashion.In the hands of Michael Bay, we may have put up with the lack of chemistry between the two leads as he would have had it sandwiched in-between overblown violent confrontations between the tribe and the settlers. But in the hands of Malick we get Pocahontas running in the fields, John Smith staring off into nowhere and the occasional holding of hands that is less sensual than when I pet my neighbors cat.The story does take an interesting turn in the final chapters when we are introduced to John Rolfe (Christian Bale who, interestingly enough, was the voice of a character in the 1995 Disney version). When Rolfe comes on the scene, Smith is long gone having faked his own death becausewell, who the hell really knows why. During her grieving, Pocahontas has become Westernized. She is no longer wearing native clothes, but rather corsets and shoes with heels. She has become fluent in the English language and accepts Rolfe as a husband even as she pines for the 'thought-as-dead' John Smith.Their relationship blossoms as the two actually touch, kiss and even have a child together before Pocahontas learns that Smith is still alive and accepts a trip to England in an effort to confront her feelings.We are probably past the two hour mark of the film now when the first thing that we actually give a damn about occurs, that being a meeting between Pocahontas and the long forgotten Smith where it will be revealed to the audience which one she will choose to fulfill her all too short life.Well, the result is not surprising due to how we got there in the first place, and even though you won't leave the theatre whistling a happy tune, at least we got an ending true to the story rather that a Hollywood re-work.But that in no way makes up for the meandering and lazing about we have to go through for 150 minutes before we get to the ending (which went on to an annoying musical score longer than the final chapter of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King last act). Too many of the audience's precious minutes are spent with camera shots of trees from the ground capturing the sunlight beaming down that I began to think that lying down in a forest all alone would be more rewarding than having to sit in an uncomfortably theatre chair and watch the same thing over and over and over again.So my lack of understanding as to the genius of Terrence Malick continues. I will agree that the guy knows his cinematography  maybe to a fault. But if this guy only produces a film on the same frequency as Haley's Comet, he at least doesn't have to subject us to view of the sky looking for the damn thing.www.robertsreviews.com",The New World
68,ajs-10,Very lone & very 'artsy'...,6,10 July 2011,"This film was recommended to me and so, on good faith alone, I sat down to watch. I've heard many good things about Terrence Malick over the years and so was looking forward to a bit of a cinematic treat. Sometime things don't turn out the way you expect and this was one of those occasions. I will explain more after this brief summary.It is the early 1600's and the eastern seaboard of America is being discovered and colonised. A group of English explorers find a place on the coast of Virginia and set up a base there. They send a group lead by Captain Smith out to trade with the natives. They capture him and are about to execute him when he is saved by the Chief's daughter, Pocahontas. Thus begins the famous love story. Eventually, after helping the colonists more than once, she is forced to go and live with them. Captain Smith is called back to England by the King and Pocahontas is left alone. Believing he is dead she takes a husband, John Rolfe, but this is not the end of the story. There, I said it was going to be brief.On the positive side this film is beautifully shot with some beautiful scenery and great set pieces. Performance-wise, nobody put a foot wrong, Colin Farrell did a fine job as Captain Smith, although I felt he was totally miscast (more on that later). Q'orianka Kilcher was also great as Pocahontas, as was Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport and Christian Bale as John Rolfe. It just didn't have any energy about it. I felt so depressed by the time I got to the end of the two hours and thirty minutes.On the casting, although I have nothing against Colin Farrell, he's a fine actor who has appeared in some great films. I just felt he was totally wrong for this role, to have an Irish man (with an Irish accent) playing the part of an English man I find totally stupid and slightly offensive. But enough of that, back to the film, I it found quite boring and also very depressing. It's very 'artsy' with the characters inner thoughts being voiced, but it just didn't work for me. I will give it a half decent score for the visuals and the music wasn't too bad either, but unless you've got a spare two hours and thirty minutes of you life you don't want back Not recommended.My Score: 5.6/10",The New World
69,russem31,Beautifully shot but long.,6,6 September 2006,"""The New World"" (2005) is a film that can best be described as a sight to see but not to feel. The latest film by director Terrence Malick, the cinematography (by Emmanuel Lubezki) is so exquisite that this film's only Oscar nomination was for just that. This cinematography makes you feel as if there was still a world of the early 1600s out there in our present world. Also a highlight is newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher as the legendary Pocahontas - her innocence and wonder of the world is shown dramatically and wonderfully through Kilcher's eyes and performance. The same can't be said about two great actors: Colin Farrell's performance as Captain John Smith nor Christian Bale as John Rolfe but then again they weren't given much to do with their roles either. Not only that, the film is very long. So long that sometimes your mind will wander. And for this main reason I cannot give the film more than a 6 out of 10. But I would still recommend it as a viewing experience of early American history.",The New World
70,mario_c,The two lovers of Pocahontas,3,16 August 2007,"Why doesn't this movie was just called ""The two lovers of Pocahontas"" instead of ""The new world""? I think it would be fairer to the viewer! This movie wasn't what I expected. To resume my review I could use just one word: DISAPPOINTMENT, but I prefer to explain why I was expecting to watch this movie for a long time, but what I expected was something more related to the exploration of the New world itself, as the title, by the way, suggests (!) and not this ""lovely"" romance of the princess Pocahontas (as the main topic of the plot)! I really think it's too centered in the Pocahontas story and it reduces much of the movie's interest, at least for me! As it wasn't enough, the film is too slowly paced, too melancholic, too ""poetic wannabe"", and very boring at parts! Besides, it has some incredible lacks in production. I can remember one scene, right in the beginning, after the ships have taken off to England, the colony (Jamestown) was infected by disease, the men were dying, and one of them said to Captain Smith that they were just 38 a few scenes later, when they are fighting the natives, WHITOUT ANY REFORCES, they seem to have dozens of men, a number too larger than 38 But that's just an example There're much more The soundtrack is also awful! Orchestra music, with strings and piano sounds, in a movie which its main topic is the exploration of the New World? Come on! It has no sense! The only music piece which I liked in this movie was a Renascence piece, near the end, when Pocahontas is meeting the King of England. It was the only one appropriated All the rest was nonsensical (to the movie's theme) and pseudo-poeticWell, what else can I say? Just maybe this movie was one of the biggest disappointments in the last times and it explains it all!",The New World

72,oneloveall,Meandering nature sucks life out of movie,5,5 May 2006,"I have great appreciation for writer/director Terrence Malick's personal philosophy when it comes to film making, having a hard time rating such a sensual director as merely average. The artist's approach at capturing a moment rather then commanding it often times has paid off with sincerely improvised performances and camera-work. However with The New World, this film-making philosophy has unwittingly reared it's pretentious, over-bloated head and seemingly bludgeoned it's powerful themes to death. It is truly a lack of substance in the script that further renders the too many ""busy shots"" shallow in context with a film that failed to keep me interested in the characters with it's meandering, self righteous narration and over zealous score. Malick's direction works best at first, before his thoughtful tone poems turn into gimmick. At the heart of the truth from this movie, there are many lush moments of photographic grandeur to behold of the purity of our earth, and those that strive to live in harmony with it, in part articulated by Kilcher's spiritual performance. As this New World is initially being explored by Farrel and viewer, the obvious reverence for the land Malick tries to induce does shine through, although once this theme is established this exercise feels routine. It is in the developing plot, or lack thereof that the film fails to accentuate it's beautifully shot, stream-of-consciousness homage to the source material. For some reason, Malick's work somehow seems a little too self important for it's own good.",The New World
73,jdkraus,"Look at the scenery, because that's all there is!",3,17 February 2008,"This is probably the most boring movie I have ever seen since A Space Odyssey. I almost fell asleep during the film. The story wasn't carried by the actors; it was shown by pretty images of water and landscapes. I felt like I was looking at a screen full of pretty pictures of nature with the stereo turned up. I do have to admit that many of the shots of nature and the work of cinematography were quite amazing, but that doesn't make a film. A film requires film-making talent, acting, and plot. There is no plot or acting. Yes, there are some famous actors in it like Colin Farrel, Christian Bale, and Christopher Plummer, but they were lucky to say a hundred words. Whenever they got a moment to talk, there voices would trail off and the music would overflow the dialog, making it nearly impossible to hear what they're saying. By the time the movie actually develops story, which is pretty much the love relationship between Pocahontas and John Rolfe, I was already in apathy. The one battle sequence, which is maybe ten minutes long didn't even get me interested. In fact, I found it rather dull compared to the intense action in that Terrence Malick marvelously directed in his The Thin Red Line. This was an art film, fully focused on the scenery and the director of photography's talent. I don't like bashing movies unless it is really horrible. Some people I know like this movie, others don't. I certainly do not like it, but it isn't the worst thing I have seen. because of the cinematography and images, I give it a generous 3/10. -Look at the scenery, because that's all there is!",The New World
74,RJBurke1942,The New World  where the legend of Pocahontas lives on...,8,19 September 2006,"At around 135 minutes, this is a long film and there are those who would say that's about sixty minutes too long. Don't take any notice of them because if you're a Terence Malick fan, then you're in for another visual treat of sublime excellence.Of course, if you're not a fan of that philosopher-director, then you'd better give this one a miss  even with Colin Farrell in the lead as Capt. John Smith.  because this film is not one for action fans, nor for those who like lots of dialog.This is for the visually attuned and informed viewer only, and for those who just like to listen to a great musical score for film.If you know anything about the story of Pocohontas, then you know it's a putative love story between Capt. Smith and her, during the time that settlers arrived at the site of modern Jamestown in 1607. Malick follows the generally accepted story  Pocohontas saves Smith from death when he is captured, falls in love with him but, after Smith leaves and is reported as being dead, she marries John Rolfe, travels to England with him and eventually dies there from some unspecified disease. The whole story is in a number of history books, you can access it at one online database I know of, but you really don't need to know anymore.Instead, just sit and watch how Malick uses the camera, sound, and editing to produce a lyrical tribute to the power of love  ""there is only this  all else is unreal"", according to the character of Smith. Don't try to listen to the dialog too intently, especially Farrell's affected thick Irish brogue that is incomprehensible at times. Be prepared for one very dramatic battle scene between the settlers and the local tribes, reminiscent of Malick's treatment of men in hand-to-hand combat in The Thin Red Line (1998): hand-held cameras, quick sharp cutting and editing, close-ups of men dying horribly and such like  although it never reaches the goriness of that great war film. I'm sure, for Malick that this particular battle is incidental to the greater power of the love story that he wanted to present.Just watch how Malick again treats the viewer with the splendor of Nature: crystal clear underwater shots, slow shots of light through trees, languid shots of wind riffling the long grasses and bushes of the Virginia coastline, stunning sunrises and sunsets, and male and female voice-overs that draw the viewer into the innermost thoughts of the protagonists. Those are all almost trademarks of Malick that he has used before, most notably in the above war film, and they are still very effective in holding this viewer, without pause.I hope it holds you equally well.",The New World
75,PersianPlaya408,The New World sucks!,6,8 June 2006,"I heard that Terence Malick directed a film after the hyped up but only semi-good THin Red Line. However The New World is not much better, actually it falls short of capturing the feeling of the era which The Thin Red Line at least did, though it was boring too, just like this film. The New World tells the story of JOhn Smith and pocahontas, and the struggle between the early settlers of Jamestown and local native Americans. However Malick tells this story in a very beautiful yet dull and boring fashion. It just didn't suit me, much to artistic, although the cinematography was beautiful, the film was just a bore.

76,roedyg,heart breaking,9,21 August 2012,"I was worried that The New World would be a Disnified tale. It was not. It was something quite unlike anything I had seen before. It tells its story mostly visually, with some natural sounds and with a soaring soundtrack in the classical style.It does not explain. It leaves everything you see just as mysterious as it was for the colonists.Though there are terrible battles, it is not one of those stupid shoot-em-ups where you are supposed to presume all virtue lies with one side and all wickedness the other.The ghastliness of living in a fledgling colony is nightmarish. Not only do you deal with contaminated food, starvation, freezing, lack of water, you deal with religious and superstitious lunatics, racists, despotic power crazed loons, torture and people with gold fever who can't think of anything else.Q'orianka Kilcher who plays Pocahontas looks much like Olivia Hussey who played Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. She has captivating body language, but does not look like a ""natural"", what the English colonists call the aboriginal people.There is not that much humour. The one scene that made me laugh was a native exploring an English formal garden and being utterly baffled by the symmetrical shapes of the topiary.There is a lot of heartache in this movie, balanced by the joy of an untrammelled natural world. It was a bit too intense for me.",The New World

The story is familiar, but the ecological sidebars attached by director Malick are not, and, even though this is a long look at more than two hours, the look at the natural world and the contrasting methods with which man utilizes it can be fascinating. Malick makes his own mark and the motive does not appear to be commercial. And good for him.",The New World
78,WriterDave,Beautiful Marriage of Aural and Visual Meditations on Discovery,10,22 January 2006,"""The New World"" has an opening five minutes where Natives rush to the shore to get a view of the massive British ships that are about to land on what would become Jamestown that are every bit as fantastic as any of the scenes in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It's a perfect marriage of sound effects, music and visuals that literally paints itself onto the celluloid as a jaw dropping work of art. The nature of ""discovery"" and the power of film is boldly on display in Terrence Malick's brave ""New World."" Some viewers will undoubtedly get lost in the visual and aural poetry, while others will be annoyed at the lack of a focused narrative and the sometimes sketchy character motives. This is a historical drama, and the amazing sets, costumes, and make-up attest to the wonderful attention to period detail, but there's also a dreamy surreal nature to the pacing that will lull some to sleep who were expecting a more traditional docudrama. This is more about the myth of Pocahantas and channeling ghosts than it is about the actual history behind the story. The dialog is as evasive and minimal as the visuals are overwhelming and painstaking. Plotting is secondary to the mood and meditations on love, discovery, curiosity, innocence, and the clashing of cultures.Malick does a great job at showing the civilized and barbaric sides of both the Natives and the British. It's a wonderful testament to that first realization that there is intelligent life outside of one's own world. Central to this discovery of the ""New World"" is the romance between John Smith (a modest Colin Farrel) and Pocahantas (an amazing Q'Orianka Kilcher) which is displayed with just as much wide eyed-wonder and innocence as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Christian Bale as John Rolfe and Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport are also very good when they are allowed to act amongst the lush scenery. Composer James Horner, who is probably second only to John Williams in creating unforgettable movie music, outdoes himself as his rousing symphony (coupled with divine music from Wagner) perfectly matches the reverence and awe with which Malick uses his visuals to paint the myth on screen.Some judicious editing may have benefited the middle portion of the film, which amounts to scene after beautiful scene of two people falling in love while worshiping nature, but there are two more series of scenes (one in the middle and one at the end) that are every bit as uplifting as the opening one and serve as a perfect synergy of visual and aural delights that completely transported this patient viewer to another realm. I'm not so sure that this is what it was really like to live in 1607, but I have no doubt this is what the people of that time dreamed about.",The New World
79,EmperorNortonII,A Beautiful But Slow Story,7,24 February 2006,"""The New World,"" directed by Terence Malick, tells the classic story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith. Here, Colin Farrell plays Captain Smith, while Pocahontas is portrayed by newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher. The story follows these characters, as well as the Indians and English settlers at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. It's not clear exactly how historically accurate the story is. Kilcher makes good in her debut, playing the timeless Indian princess as kindly and compassionate. As for the movie, the imagery is lush with shots of beautiful forests. Some of the dialogue is well-written, such as the poetic voice-overs. But the story is slow in its pace. Either the movie had to be shorter, or there had to be more elements to hold the attention of the viewers.",The New World
80,phenomynouss,Not a film,2,8 May 2006,"I decided to chance it one day and go see ""The New World"" because it had one of my most respected actors in it (Colin Farrel and Christopher Plummer) and it looked quite good, since there were very few realistic colonial-era movies of the subject.What I saw in the theater was not a film.It felt like a pretentious art student's college film trying so hard to be blasé and chic and all those fancy crazy words with obscure meanings that scream ""creative"" and fumbles like a giant tumbling off a cliff.First off, the sparse dialogue. There's hardly much dialogue in any scene minus a few lines spoken by a character off-camera or for a few shots on camera. If all the dialogue were put together and single-spaced, it'd take up at most five pages of the script. The sparse dialogue isn't even memorable or deeply moving! It's just blandly stating the obvious like ""we're here in the new world."" ""the natives are savages"" ""it's been three days."" So where does most of the movie go if there's virtually no dialogue? Cinematography. I rate this two stars only because it looked authentic. The vast majority of the camera and film was devoted to cinematography and just filming trees and grass swaying in the wind and birds and indians frolicking like playful little things.The young new actress playing Pocahantas (who isn't even named in the film, we just assume she's Pocahantas) is really uneventful and unfulfilling, and a bore to look at. At least Colin Farrel tries hard in his role, whereas Christopher Plummer doesn't look too anxious and seems glad to be rid of himself by the middle of the movie.The latter half takes place in England, where Pocahantas ends up with another colonist. It's equally silent there dialogue-wise, and very uneventful save for a silent meeting with the King and Queen and a frolic through the vast maze gardens of the palace's backyard.So in total, the movie consisted of Pocahantas frolicking, and some scenes with the white men and indians looking concerned and the occasional spoken word or gunfire. But mostly frolicking.",The New World
81,ruby_fff,A 'must see' for anyone who appreciates filmmaker Terrence Malick's work - a cinematic feast and celebration of humanity through the legend of Pocahontas,8,26 March 2006,"""The New World"" is an epic tale, of a young girl's wide-eyed experience of first love, of a family tribe's struggles vs. explorers' conquering fares, of a woman growing up through learning to cope with difficulties/loss, helpless violence/war, loneliness/solitude, tenaciously keeping kindness in her heart in spite of it all. Malick's vision is essentially realized by an extraordinary debut performance from Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas. It's an indisputably 'Tour De Force' Kilcher, carrying the whole film from beginning to end (135 minutes of it), beyond Colin Farrell's role of Captain John Smith, to acting along side with the ever subtle strength of (""Batman Begins"") Christian Bale as Englishman John Rolfe, who became Pocahontas' dear husband and father to her child.The film is not a family movie even though 'Pocahontas' sounded Disney. This is about the historical legend of Pocahontas, how the Princess of the New World came to be. Malick uses his unique style: there are quiet deliveries of thoughts spoken (though at times, we the audience can't hear too clearly as the words were so 'silently' uttered) - we are observers to the characters, events, scenes presented on screen - poetic in its own way. Mind you there is substance, the story told is full of details and information for the taking (even though narrative seems minimal). It is a rewarding 'filmic' experience not to be rushed but gently absorbed. In spite of the harsh scenes and seeming violence, it is very much a story about humanity, of one amazing woman's contribution to mankind.Having passed through Cape Horn and scenes of Ushuaia, I especially appreciate the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki of the natural beauty of the sky, land and waters - the light and hues do seem 'out of this world'. James Horner provided the complementary score. There are approaches reminiscent of Malick's previous film, ""Days of Heaven"" 1978, with Richard Gere, Brook Adams and Sam Shepard. Cinematographers Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler delivered remarkable natural light scenes with Ennio Morricone's integral score to perfection.",The New World

Cities are reaching higher and higher into the sky. Areas once populated with trees and streams are now occupied by housing complexes and mini-malls. The land once known as the ""new world"" is fading.Terrence Malick's (The Thin Red Line, Badlands) The New World focuses on the first encounter between the white man and the Native Americans. Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer, The Insider) leads a group of men with the help of the sometimes troublesome Captain John Smith (Clin Farrell, Phone Booth) and a host of other Englishmen as they try and establish a colony in this ""new world"".The natives, upon seeing these massive ships pouring out strange men in funny costumes, are started and intrigued. Chief Powhatan has many wives and many daughters. Pocahontas is, by far, his favorite daughter. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher is dazzling as the energetic, free spirited native.After setting up a fort like encampment, Smith and others go out in search of the native's camp. Smith finds himself surrounded by a large group of natives and they overpower him. He is taken back to their Chief who has the final say in what will be done to Smith. In a very ceremonious motion, Pocahontas persuades her father to spare his life and let her find out the ways of his people.For a long time, Smith and Pocahontas teach each other who their people really are by learning the others language. The first session between the two is one of the many intimate and tasteful scenes in the movie.The movie itself is a historical retelling of the events that occurred in Jamestown in the 17the century. The movie is practically void of dialogue and tends to focus more on the emotions of its characters. Malick does, however, incorporate character narration, which gives us an interesting look into what they are feeling. The movie is, in some ways, a collection of journal entries by Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe (Christian Bale, Batman Begins) come-to-life.Kilcher was about 14 years old when the movie was made. Some of the intimate scenes are very passionate, but tame for today's moviegoers. She shows a lot of potential for the future. Along with Kilcher is a very different Farrell. He gives his best performance since Tigerland (2000).Malick's work with the camera is impressive. Nature seems to co-exists with the characters and interacts with them. It is incredibly surreal at times. James Horner's (A Beautiful Mind, Titanic) beautiful score enhances this effect.Nominated for an Academy Award in Best Cinematography, The New World is not your typical film. The battle scenes are tastefully done as so every member of the audience can refrain from covering their eyes. Overall, the movie is well made, well-acted, and is an interesting look at an important historical event.",The New World

That may seem harsh, but considering the ridiculous praise Terence Malick has gotten for his supposedly 'outstanding cinematography' on The New World, I don't feel like holding back any criticism. I hate this almost as much as I hate Crash (2004) and that's saying something.The New World is unbearably slow, and I am not some movie-goer with the maximum attention span for a 90 minutes action feature. It was so slow you stopped being involved with the story. Talk about a director who had NO IDEA what he was doing, so he just stationed the camera, shot a few trees blowing in the wind, put it in his movie to compensate for the poor writing and called it 'art' - and immediately, geek fan-boys creamed their pants. I would have loved to see Malick explore the myth-laden new continent with adventures and culture contrasts, and instead got some pseudo-introspective nature special.This film is simply not very good on any level. It is perhaps decent when it comes to acting, since even Colin Farrell managed to pull off a performance that wasn't all that bad. However, I am tired of Malick-fanboys claiming that he is some sort of ""visual poet"" and that The New World was full of deeper meaning that normal people ""just cannot grasp"". Malick is in fact highly amateurish in his visual approach and there is nothing original about the shots. He should do nature documentaries instead - because that is what the images look like, there's no 'oomph'. I appreciate visual directors with an edge and some originality to their style (Burton, Herzog, Green etc.) and I know one when I see one - and Malick isn't one. He either borrows or misuses styles.What he does wrong is - he lets his story facilitate the pointless nature visuals, instead of letting the visuals facilitate his story (like David Gordon Green). He went with leaves blowing in the wind because it's a very safe thing to do and easily labelled 'art'. Is it any good? No, not really. It's a chicken-sh!t cop-out. There is nothing captivating about the film. Just molded and ready for film-geek worship.

It tells the story of John Smith and Pocohantas without the corny music numbers and of course it isn't animated but the romance is still there. John Smith and Pocohauntas were historical figures but they're also myths and some parts of their history are left to our imagination. Terrence Malick takes on the story with that sense of imagination while he grounds the visual look with a meticulous attention to historic detail. While it has some good action scenes, it's not an adventure epic in the mold of, say Indiana Jones, but one steeped in authenticity, more so, and actual real life probably went a little slower than you're used to seeing in movies, so be patient with it cause it is a very worthwhile and moving story.",The New World

As the star-crossed lovers fight to keep the love between them a secret but alive the story ebbs and flows along at a pace that works like wind blowing through long grass. Everything here from the soundtrack to the poetic words layered over the colours of the world and its inhabitants creates a kind of dreamlike feel. With elements of the work of Andy Goldsworthy in the streams and logs, plants and rocks this film is just amazing to look at. Malick has a way of directing that seems to contain pauses and fill the film with space. Clocking in at two and a half hours you don't feel it at all as you sit in the cinema and let it wash over you. Another great film from a subtle but very talented director.",The New World
94,teddyryan,Still Needs A Trim,8,25 January 2006,"Terrence Malick never ceases to impress. In stride with his classic films, BADLANDS and DAYS OF HEAVEN, the director's ode to the Captain John Smith-Pocohantas saga is a staggering work of beauty. The performances by Farrel & Co are solid. And the work of newcomer (There's No Way I Can Spell Her Name) leads the way into a stunningly accurate portrayal of love, virtue, and the human spirit. Unfortunately, Malick's cinematic indulgences tend to grow tiresome towards the end of the film; and, it soon becomes obvious that Malick needed a 5th editor (I guess 4 won't cut it for this guy). Still, if you're willing to be mildly bored at times, THE NEW WORLD is quite a viewing.",The New World
95,ikanboy,Beautifully filmed torpor,6,28 January 2006,"I kept quiet throughout the movie, as I thought my wife - who likes films with period pieces,Indians and romance - was enjoying it. She told me afterwards that all the ladies in the loo hated the movie because it was sooo slow, and she agreed with them. The movie is terribly self indulgent and languid, oh did I forget to mention it is quite beautifully filmed (I think everyone who wants desperately to find something good will say that.) More is said by John Smith and Pocahontas (whose name is never mentioned)in commentary than in actual dialogue, and I found both difficult to understand. He, because of a guttural English accent, and she because of her softness. I was happy when Bale came on the scene, if only because he spoke clearly.This movie reminded me of ""Days of Heaven"" with it's endless scenes of scenery and scant dialogue, and lo and behold, I did not even know, until just now, after googling it, that it's the same director. That's worrisome, I think, to have a style that is so recognizable, yet only known by cognoscente. It speaks of the smug joy of esoteria. Oh did I mention it had a nice haunting score.",The New World
96,MovieGuy109,A little boring but astoundingly filmed by Malick,8,22 November 2011,"Malick's fourth film may test your ability to stay awake during quiet pictures but if you keep your eyes open you will be astounded by the beauty of every image of the film. The images have a strong feel for the landscape and the people in the landscape and the most staggering thing about them is the fact that Malick is able to tell his story so well through images alone. This shows just how powerful Malick can be, though here he is not at the top of his form. It has many weak points but the beauty of the picture and Malick's stunning accuracy with his shots is what keeps this film together even when it wants to fall apart before our eyes.",The New World

Music and sound design has been crafted well.Tear jerking and bold stuff, ultimately satisfying.",The New World
98,gregeichelberger,The World's Slowest Indian - Movie,3,6 December 2012,"There's certainly no shortage of movies which depict how Europeans came to the Americas, destroyed the land, wiped out the natives and bespoiled what was a mostly bucolic existence.""The Mission,"" ""1492,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and even the animated Disney film, ""Pocahontas,"" among others, come immediately to mind.The latest effort, from director Terrence Malick (""Days Of Heaven,"" ""Thin Red Line""), ""The New World,"" runs approximately 150 minutes, with 50 percent of the dialogue unspoken between the two leads, Capt. John Smith (Colin Farrell, ""Phonebooth,"" ""Alexander"") and Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), which proves beyond all doubt that Malick is the master of the unnecessary voice-over.The film starts on an upbeat note as three diminutive English ships sail into a harbor in the Virginia Company territory in 1607. As these boats stream towards shore, the local Indians react with surprise and alarm while James Horner's musical score swells to a tremendous crescendo.A contingent of soldiers arrive led by Capt. Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer, ""The Insider,"" ""Syriana""). The invaders quickly spoil things by killing an Indian, after which they cannot trade for food (or apparently grow their own), so they go through their stores, forcing Newport to return to England for more men and supplies.Before he leaves, though, Newport sends Smith (who was about to be hung) on a mission to a larger village to procure trade goods and food for the long winter. Smith travels with a captured native guide and finally reaches the realm of powerful chief Powhatan (August Schellenerg, ""Iron Will""), where he is beaten and taken prisoner.He is about to be killed, but his life is spared (you know the story) by the youngest child of the chief, known as ""Playful One,"" although her Indian name is never mentioned in the film. Smith then sort of becomes her property/teacher and spends the next six months mentoring her on the ways of the English.This also gives Malick an opportunity to show the two frolicking in the forest forcing their tepid love onto each other over what seems like an epoch.The director also seems to enjoy introducing random shots to the audience. A bird (or flock of them), a tree, a cloud, the water, a chair, an Indian sitting in a chair, Colin Farrell's eyebrows and beard, Q'orianka Kilcher's lips, another bird, a baby turtle (really), wheat, corn, another tree, etc., etc., etc. It looks like the video for R.E.M.'s ""Losing My Religion."" After close to an hour of this unrelenting gallivanting between Smith and Pochahontas, finally something happens when the prisoner is released upon the condition that they leave in the country in the spring. The contrast between Powhatan's village and the run-down colony of Jamestown is vividly presented, as well.The Indians live clean, holy blameless lives while the Englishmen become slowly demented (through prolonged starvation, I suppose), kill each other, drop dead like flies, live in squalor and rant like idiots. One guy blathering directly into the camera like a bad Monty Python character.At one time, Smith claims ""there are only 38 of us,"" in the fort, but then death and disease take their toll, as well as the one battle with the natives, in which seemingly dozens are slaughtered (and only Smith is able to fight), but there seems to be more goofy Brits than ever occupying the colony. Smith is overthrown in a mutiny, Newport arrives with some more homey Englishmen and women, firing his ships cannons and scaring the Indians into submission.Pochahontas comes to live in the colony, giving Smith and her a few more chances to roll around in the woods, but soon he is sent off to England and commissioned by King James to find a northwest passage to the West Indies. He is reported dead and the young Indian maiden is then courted by tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale, ""Batman Begins""). She is baptized, changes her name to Rebecca, reluctantly marries him and immediately has a four-year-old son.Of course Smith is not really dead, but having an affair with a woman in Newfoundland (sigh), and Rolfe and Rebecca are invited to England to meet the king and queen, where she quickly becomes the toast of London. She has a final meeting with Smith, symbolically dumps him and later dies (it's true, she did die in England in real life).With the random shots (especially of Kircher dancing and playing around in the forest), the whole tale seems to take longer than the actual colonization of America, and with half of the speaking parts seemingly done telepathically, there is no real chemistry between the two leads. Pocahontas and Rolfe's love is even less intense, making you wonder what the point of the entire enterprise was.Realistic costumes, sets and decent cinematography do not make up for the wooden acting and stilted script. If you have $10 and two-and-a-half hours to kill, see this picture. If not, just rent ""Last of the Mohicans,"" or ""The Mission,"" learn a little history and enjoy a film-watching experience at the same time.",The New World

100,rparham,"A rather lifeless ""World""",6,13 February 2006,"Terrence Malick's The New World is a sumptuous looking motion picture, full of natural beauty and what is by far the most believable depiction of what the world of America might have been like in 1602 Virginia when the first European colonists arrived to form Jamestown. However, as gorgeous as The New World is, it is also a rather empty film for most of it's running time, featuring actors who are supposed to be characters but end up as just ciphers and we are left looking at beautiful imagery representing very little.As stated above, The New World is set at the landing of the European's on Virginia's shores. Among them is John Smith (Colin Farrell) who is in the ship's hold and about to be hanged upon landing for mutinous statements. The colony's governor (Christopher Plummer) spares his life, however, and sets him on a mission to develop a relationship with the local Native Americans, referred to here as ""Naturals."" Smith is captured by the naturals and brought before their chief, Powhatan (August Schellenberg), who plans to take his life as part of a plan to drive the settlers from their shores. Smith's life is saved by Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher), and she and Smith eventually fall in love. Powhatan later releases Smith to return to Jamestown, with the intention of the settlers departing, but Smith and his people stay, and are supported through the efforts of Pocahontas, who gives them food and supplies. In the process, she angers her father, who disowns her and she quickly finds herself stranded by her love also, when Smith, ambivalent about their relationship, departs for a new expedition and leads her to believe that he has died. Grief stricken, she is eventually rescued from her woe by tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale), who, while less flashy and instinctive than Smith, shows her love and companionship.The above description is actually pieced together from a variety of sources, since if you just watch the film, you would not be sure if Pocahontas was really in love with Smith, that John Rolfe was named John Rolfe and that Pocahontas was ever named Pocahontas (she is referred to later in the film by her English name, Rebecca). Malick has produced a film that is long on pretty pictures and short on dialogue and character development. I applaud him to a certain extent for being willing to tell a story through mostly imagery, letting events unfold by way of his pictures, something not every director is skilled at. Most of the narrative is discernible from the string of images, but what is missing are the people at the center of the story. Smith is little more than a grungy guy who falls for the natural way of life and spends a lot of time frolicking in the fields with Pocahontas. Pocahontas is a playful girl who likes holding John Smith's hand and later appears rather distraught at his loss. Yes, I can discern the basics from the character's faces, but that doesn't make them people to me. These aren't characters, they are just bodies wandering through the camera's range. When dialogue is uttered, it is often rather hushed and indecipherable. At some instances when the naturals speak to each other in their native tongue, when the subtitles pop up on screen I swear that there was actually no dialogue spoken on screen.Malick substitutes some of the dialogue for long, whispery monologues that are supposed to represent the character's thoughts, but these are also often difficult to make-out, and occasionally are rather pretentious. Smith rambles on about how the new world represents a new beginning for people in one segment and manages to use about every example he can find to describe how people can start over on this new continent. I got the point long before Smith stops talking. Towards the end of the film, the relationship between Pocahontas and Rolfe does develop some tenderness, but that is only in the last fifteen minutes; before that, I don't know if I really cared. Pocahontas finds it difficult to lover her new companion when she still feels deeply for Smith, but we as an audience can't begin to relate, because their relationship had no chemistry, no passion, no life.Malick's film is, indeed, an absolute treasure trove of imagery that is awesome. It could almost pass for a documentary of what life at that time would have felt like. This is no Hollywood set, it has all the verisimilitude of the real world, and for that alone, for those who are interested, it is worth a look. Malick even seems to rely on very little visual effects. There are no elaborate panoramas, no matte paintings or CGI. This is all mostly what the camera can see, and it helps immeasurably to maintain the illusion of reality. For those, like me, who often wonder what is what like to live in the past, The New World is the closest I have ever come to really experiencing it.I have never seen one of Malick's other films, but based on what I have read, the flaws are the same in The New World as any other film in his oeuvre. Many can appreciate his unique contribution to film-making, and I don't believe that The New World is without merit. But I also believe that the best films, usually, are about characters, and that is what is missing here, so Malick's treatise on the founding of America is, in the end, beautiful imagery that is hollow at the core.",The New World
101,ThomasColquith,An Art House Look at the New World,5,10 June 2021,"This is very much an art house movie which will appeal to certain viewers, but not to everyone. It is a look at the first English settlement in Jamestown, Virginia and the interactions between the colonists and the Native Americans. But the film really follows Pocahontas mostly. There are many shots with little to no dialog, with the characters just walking, spinning, or sitting in the fields or woods. The characters are all very laconic and loath to express themselves. Thus it is a slow movie and it has a long running time. We actually don't even hear Pocahontas' name uttered the entire movie, which I found odd.So to be clear, this is not an action movie, but a character study of Pocahontas and John Smith mostly; however, it doesn't fully achieve that mission. The characters are still not well defined even after two hours due to the aforementioned unwillingness to express themselves, but it is an interesting look at what the first settlers faced upon reaching the New World and what the Native Americans faced as well.Although the film does give the audience some sense of the difficult situation the settlers faced, especially that first winter, the movie overall is still a bit too dull and long. And for a movie of this style, a better soundtrack would have really helped -- it was just one song played repetitively. But the settings, filming, costumes, etc. Were all good and seemed appropriate to me. In summary: worth watching once, but probably not twice, 5/10.",The New World
102,Ziya90,"Boring? No, just slow paced",8,10 January 2011,"Cinema is an art, also it is an entertainment yes, but it makes me really sad that ""such kind of"" movies are seen as dull pieces by a lot of people especially by youths. Because it doesn't serve crowds to please them. In that way, The New World is not an entertainment movie may be, there are no humorous lines, no lots of action, no typical romance, but this does not mean that it is not enjoyable. ""Nothing happens in the movie!"" is the most typical statement probably used for such kind of movies or sometimes you probably come across titles like ""boooooooringgggg"". I want to confess that I am a person who does not easily get bored, in fact, I rarely get bored by a movie, but of course there are movies which I found extremely dull, but because those movies were lack of any emotion, any effect and even spirit, because I found nothing impressive, but The New World is not such a movie absolutely. I did not get bored at all, I did not get bored even a minute! Honestly, I don't always agree with people, when they call a movie poetic, probably because it sounds like pseudo intellectualism to me, but The New World is really poetic. One more confess, I am not a Terrence Malick fan, so I haven't found all of his movies great or excellent, but The New World was great and my favorite one with The Thin Red Line. The direction is great except the fact that at times the movie is a bit disconnected, between the transitions, but if we think that this is a visual poem, then it is not a flaw. This is a flowing like a river and relieving like a poem movie. No need to say that visually the movie is very beautiful, the cinematography is mesmerizing. Personally, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale are two of my favorite actors (of course this is one of the reasons that I liked the movie), but other than that, they are great actors, especially Bale and their characters are interesting. And when Bale takes on the stage, the movie becomes greater. May be, as one of the sub stories in the movie, a foreign man is captured by a tribe, at first they decide to kill him, but then something changes their mind or the foreigner falls in love with a girl in the tribe is a pretty cliché or dated idea, but it dissolves in this unusual film thanks to Malick. As a male, I had been seriously afraid of watching a dull romance, but definitely it was not! and unexpectedly, it was also free from clichés and realistic. The elegant final part that recalls costume dramas is a separate beauty, even if a twist at the end is pretty far fetched. Finally, alienation (from society, culture and by modernization) is reflected well. An adventure, a tale, The New World.",The New World
103,mrcaw1,Well done though historically inaccurate...,8,4 September 2006,"Terrence Malick, the director, once again creates a film of extraordinary beauty.Yes his films tend to be slower than most Hollywood films. In this case, though, I think the slowness is well suited to what the director is trying to convey.It's my opinion that Malick wanted to bring our 21st century mindsets back to the pacing of life in the early 1600s. Things took time. And in that sense,, he has succeeded.The film unfolds like chapters in a novel. Keeping that analogy, I think it would help the average movie goer to keep this in mind before watching the film. Expectations are always key, so if one goes into this film expecting a slow paced film, I think the viewer will then be able to relax and let the mood of the film do its job.Collin Farrell was fine in his role as Captain John Smith. Unlike his unfortunate portrayal of Alexander in the movie of the same name, here Farrell blends well into the time frame.Q'Orianka Kilcher playing Pocahontas was truly wonderful and handled here role with a wisdom beyond her years.Christian Bale, as usual gives a thoroughly professional performance though his role is small and only in the last forty minutes of the movie or so.Christpher Plummer, also, while in a small role, gives his typical professional job.Malick is famous for his gorgeous cinematography and he doesn't disappoint his fans one bit with this film.I enjoyed the movie quite a lot. I knew going into it, that Malick doesn't always rely solely on narrative structure but uses mood ambiance, the sense of time passing, etc. to help tell his story.That being said, be aware that liberties were taken with historical accuracy. The biggest liberty being the age of Pocahontas.Pocahontas would have been about 10-12 years old when she encountered Captain Smith. Captain Smith's age was accurately portrayed as he would have been around 27 years old, approximately the same age as Mr. Farrell.Historians say that Captain Smith's account of his being saved by Pocahontas were probably embellishments by Captain Smith made many years later to give his story of his time in the new world some excitement.Further, writings by Captain Smith the first winter after his time in the new world, make no mention of the story of Pocahontas saving his life but rather that he was treated as an honored guest of the Powhantan people.So it is a bit unfortunate that Mr Malick in all his efforts to create as accurate a movie as possible, should, for his own devices, fabricate the central story of his movie.For accuracy's sake, he would have been better served to show Pocahontas as the child she was in the beginning of the movie and instead of focusing on her relationship with Captain Smith, focus on her relationship with John Rolfe, who was after all, more central to her life than Captain Smith was.",The New World

105,ilovedolby,"""The New World"" is a marvelous film built on reflective images through both its cinematography and narration.",10,22 January 2006,"The story of Pocahontas and her relationship with John Smith has long been renowned in early American history. The common misconception is that she and Smith were lovers. This notion has been played upon in literature and even popular family entertainment such as Disney's 1995 movie, ""Pocahontas."" Terrence Malick's new film, ""The New World"" takes that road, as well. However,it never becomes a sexual relationship; at least not that we ever see. The characters at most share a kiss from time and time and admit they love one another. The film's producer, Sarah Green, defends this by implying that the filmmakers wanted to maintain an element where the film combines the actual history with the mythology of Pocahontas' life. The implied love between Smith and Pocahontas is highly effective in telling the story. The love story is what drives her to help the colonials and to persuade her future choices to marry Rolfe and go to England. In the end, we see a woman who is more than a lover and a diplomat, but a truly courageous and open minded individual who bridged the cultural gap between nations. The basic facts are known about Pocahontasshe and Smith were friends and she helped the Jamestown colony by providing food during the harsh winter. But ""The New World"" goes beyond the fundamentals and delivers her entire life. Smith eventually is sent back to England on an expedition to the Northern American lands for the King. Pocahontas is eventually captured by the colonials as leverage between the then warring English and as the films refers to, Naturals (Natives). During that time, Pocahontas assimilates into the English culture through style of dress and the like, while never forgetting her past. She eventually meets John Rolfe, marries him and has a son. They go to England where she is received by the King and Queen and are treated as royalty. She eventually dies of disease. What separates this film from being a documentary is how it is crafted. ""The New World"" is a film built on reflective images through both its cinematography and narration. The cinematography often focuses on the wind in the trees, the flowing of water, the changing of the seasons, sunrises and sunsets. Not at any time does this film succumb to being a common entertainmentit is not built on useless action scenes or unnecessary violence. Nor does it pursue any sexual element between either love stories involving Pocahontas with Smith or Rolfe. After all, when she met Smith, Pocahontas was no more than 14 years old. Still the film is glorious to observe. Its narration, perhaps the poetry of a journal or the ramblings of characters in their elder years, brings an evocative feel to the picture. It is as if director Malick wants the audience to feel the passage of time as the characters did. Moreover, the film asks us to slow down and appreciate elements of nature before a time when development would take over these lands. We are immersed in shots of the forests, the rivers that lead to the ocean and of the sandy beaches of the Virginia coastline. Combined with the musical score of composer James Horner, this being the finest score he has produced since ""A Beautiful Mind,"" the film takes on a form of escapism like no other film of 2005. Pocahontas is played by newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher in a very fine performance. She plays the young princess with subtlety showing the free-spirited antics of a young woman combined with a maturity beyond her years. Colin Farrell plays Smith with finesse. He represents the famed British soldier with a warrior's drive combined with the mind of appreciation for the new world he is discovering. In other scenes, he portrays the care he feels for Pocahontas through expressionism. In one particular scene, he comes to the realization that any pursuit of a future with Pocahontas is out of the question. We see his eyes well up and his somber countenance evoking a deeper, inner sorrow. Even more credit needs to be given to Christopher Plummer's short performance of the leader of the English crew at the film's beginning. Plummer has a presence of authority that few actors command. His constant dignified look and manners or speech represent not only those of a refined character, but of a refined actor. Also, Christian Bale is terrific as Rolfe. His love for the native princess is disheartened by her grief over loosing Smith and leaving her people. But the character never becomes enraged or jealous of Smithhe is a gentleman and will not be reduced to that level. He loves her and understands that her relationship with Smith was something that he could not be. Bale portrays this performance with the class of veteran actors like Michael Caine. Incidentally, Bale played a voice in Disney's 1995 ""Pocahontas"" as one of the English settlers. The very title signifies more than the new world that the English found. It represents the new world that the native princess would find herself in, and every new world that she would encounter on the road of her short, yet amazing life.I have always noted that film is an expression of life. ""The New World"" is a film that expresses a different kind of life, in a different time amongst diverse individuals. Regardless of whether or not an intimate relationship existed between Smith and Pocahontas is a myth that is disputed by countless historians. But in this case, I do not care. This film is so effective through the subtlety of its storytelling, cinematography, performance, musical score and direction that it transcends the simplicity of the term 'history' to become 'legend.' What a marvelous film!",The New World

The performances are universally outstanding, the cinematography and editing award worthy, and the use of 'Das Rheingold' the most inspired use of Wagner ever in a movie.

107,hunter-friesen,"""The New World"" enamors with beauty",7,22 April 2021,"*Watched the 172-minute extended edition*It feels unfair to assign a numerical rating to a Terrence Malick film. He is the prime example of film being a purely subjective art form.I can't explain why ""The Tree of Life"" is one of the best films ever made and ""Song to Song"" is pretentious trash, despite both of them being nearly the exact same in style and story.The title, ""The New World"", has multiple meanings as the film tells the story of John Smith and Pocahontas's reaction to the unknown lands and customs they experience.But like all Malick films, the plot description you read is only just a snippet of the entire product. It's more contemplative than literal, inviting you into a poetic world filled with more beauty than the eye can comprehend.Malick supplies you with all the pieces you have come to expect. Absolutely gorgeous cinematography, whisper narration, a wonderful score, and great ""acting"" (what is acting in a Malick film?). It is up to you to find meaning and worth in what he is giving you.For me, I found the first half to be some of the best work Malick has ever done. His exploration of the ""savage life"", one filled with holistic community, makes you want to leave your reality behind and leap into the screen. Kevin Costner may have done this in ""Dances with Wolves"", but Malick outshines him with his rolling camera as it takes a much more observational tone.What has become a trademark of Malick is that the second half rapidly loses momentum as it mainly rehashes the same points. The film is saved by the final ten minutes, but the 100-160-minute span feels rough.""The New World"" makes you cry tears of beauty and tears of boredom.

The only reason why I say this is because she's been in more films and is more well known. As for Colin Farrell, I'm afraid he didn't play John Smith very convincingly. The gentleman who played Pocahontas's 2nd lover should have been John Smith while Mr. Farrell should have played the 2nd lover.But.....ANYWAY....other than it's historical accuracy, I don't believe it'll win any Oscars.

109,jay4stein79-1,Dinosaurs,10,20 May 2006,"Terrence Malick is a dinosaur--the one holdover from that gilded era of American cinema, the 1970s. While audience have bore witness to the erosion of his contemporaries' artistry (seriously, when was the last time Coppola or Rafelson or Bogdonovich made a worthwhile flick?), Terrence has stayed true to his early ethos by continuing to create lyrical, beautifully photographed, and not-entirely-narrative films. Of course, it's easier to keep your edge when you've only made four films in 32 years. The New World, though I don't yet think as highly of it as Badlands, is a great film and certainly on the same level as his other bona fide masterpiece, Days of Heaven (gosh, that his weakest film is the amazing The Thin Red Line is absurd, especially since it could have been the magnum opus of a lesser director). What I think is the film's greatest achievement is its ability to take figures that have become larger than life and make them real. In a sense, the film guts the mythology of Pocahontas but doesn't really give an un-idealized version of early colonial settlement--it simply doesn't give an idealized version of that time. Though it bemoans, to a degree, Pocahontas's ""crossing over"" from native to Englishwoman (the scenes of her first adopting European garb are very poignant and melancholy, I think), New World does not make out the Englishmen to be evil, invading monsters. They are well-meaning, but they're not necessarily heroes. They're real men with real faults. Malick has done a great service to the story of early Colonial times by not elevating it to the level of epic; it is a very simple story of a very important encounter told without, really, too much looking forward. We bring historical baggage to the film, but New World does not really bring baggage of its own. That's amazing. The performances are wonderful with Kilcher and Bale the real standouts (Farell and Plummer are also excellent, but, let's be honest, at this point I expect that). Of course, it's tricky to judge a performance in a film by Terrence Malick, since much of the film's story is told through voice-over narration, but the faces of the actors he uses convey more emotions and thoughts than thousands of words could. In other words, if anyone could make a silent movie now, it would be Terrence Malick. As expected, the photography is also immaculate. Watching New World reminds me of all those things I adore about the geography of this country. It will make you realize why the colonists looked to this land as a sort of Paradise and why it still is a gorgeous land. New World will, I think, stand the test of time and be long remembered along side Malick's other masterpieces. It's a great film that lovers of cinema will enjoy. If you're looking for a rollicking adventure, though, you might want to go elsewhere.",The New World
110,Torgo_Approves,"A dendrophile's wet dream... lots of trees, little else",3,22 March 2007,"Terrence Malick comes out of a 7-year retirement to deliver this epic story of the romance between Pocahontas and John Smith, in a movie which features gorgeous photography and... what else? The story is certainly not interesting, the film is as pretentious as they come yet seems to have little to say, and Colin Farrell is about as charismatic as a toned-down Keanu Reeves in the main role. The film is a seemingly endless blend of shots of trees, shots of water, shots of the Virginia forest, shots of more water, shots of more trees, shots of more Virginian forest, and hundreds of Meaningful Glances(TM) between Farrell and Pocahontas (played by newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, seemingly the only part of the cast who isn't a living dead), and pretentious pseudo-philosophical voiceovers.The film moves at a snail's pace and although I started out enjoying the music and images I ended up hating the film and how empty, pointless and repetitive it was. There's no chemistry between Smith and Pocahontas and the whole film is plagued by a dry, dull feeling. Even the short action scene somewhere towards the middle of the film is dull, as you're too detached from the characters and story to actually care. Not only does he make two hours feel like five, Malick also completely wastes the enormous talent of the cast. Christian Bale has maybe 20 minutes of actual screen time to develop his character and his dialogue is as tediously would be-philosophical as Farrell's and Kilcher's. Christopher Plummer and David Thewlis drop by to say maybe six or seven lines total and then disappear without making any impression. This is one of those films that you will either get or not, and the atmosphere which Malick tried to create didn't work for me at all. It is still an original movie in many ways, but a failure in my opinion. You will either love this or hate it. I know many people saw atmospheric genius where I saw dull, pretentious waste of film, so I can't safely say that you will hate it. It's a very personal matter, I guess.Or maybe I'm just too hopelessly plebian to ""understand"" the great vision of Malick. I should note that I have nothing at all against long and/or slow movies - films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather and Lost in Translation actually have some *substance* to them instead of thousands of shots of high grass - but this was just too much and too empty. Yawn.",The New World
111,merrywood,An extraordinary filmic experience.,8,3 February 2006,"We know enough about British adventurer-explorer John Smith (who later named the region where I now live, New England) one of central figures in the Jamestown Colony of Virginia to understand how Terrence ""Sparky"" Malick was inspired to write and direct this movie. It follows the story of how Captain John Smith, then 26 (in 1606) was captured by the aboriginal people of Virginia and whose life was saved by the chieftain's preteen daughter. Pocahontas. Malick is not a light-weight filmmaker (DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE) but he is an indulgent one. THE NEW WORLD is a meditative Tone Poem (yes, I know, this nomenclature belongs to music) the only appropriate term that comes to mind. It has polarized critics and audiences as well. The film really belongs to an earlier period perhaps before the invention of television. It has been called ""elegiac"" by some critics who have swooned over it. I tend to agree. It is all at once, the aforementioned symphonic poem, a composition in one movement and a tender, crushingly moving love story that touches its audience deeply but does not leave marks. The nature of true love and life is both observed and reflected upon. The background tableau is essentially the natural world preexisting the European intrusion into the Western Hemisphere. In this environment Malick has been able to simplify the phenomenon of love and examine it in a wonderful light.If I were a critic I would say that the film can use some cutting. We revisit Malick's pastoral visions more than once too many times. All that said, this is a very unusual experience in film. Its photography is magnificent and the music score exquisite. Perhaps it's one that we badly need in this our day of overwhelmingly chaotic, rapid-fire, synthetic life. Highly recommended!",The New World
112,lois-lane33,Mixed.,5,16 September 2014,"Collin Farrell plays a guy in the 17th century that used the F word when he gets angry. Didn't everybody? I kinda doubt it. Anyhoo-this film also casts a woman from Germany as Pocahontas which I found kinda surprising given that there definitely are more than one good looking First Nations actresses. Had a few good moments-when Collin Farrell's character is ""rewarded"" for his good behaviour & tasked with finding the northwest passage-which in those days was basically a death sentence. Things go badly and things go worse in the New World. Made me think of the story about 100 members of the Rowanoke settlement that vanished except for the word Croaton carved into a tree-which pointed a finger at the Croaton First Nations which dwelled in that area also. No mention of that in the script. Lots of 'naturals' leaping about and vowing to drive the white men into the sea. Where they like that? Nobody knows for sure. Plenty of virgin scenery in this film and the relationship that developed between Pocahontas & Captain Smith is all this really seems to be about. It's not really billed as a love story though. Maybe it depends where you are in terms of how you interpret the movie. I can see Europeans liking it-as in probably the 'difference of it' (or because Collin Farrell was in it) For me -since I live in North America & have spent a fair amount of time in northern areas where First Nations people are often the dominant social group, I found the film lacking. And it made me feel a bit uncomfortable.",The New World
113,Solnichka,Same ol' Malick,9,29 January 2006,"This film was just like _The Thin Red Line_ to me: beautiful, artistic, deep, insightful and a little too long. I love Malick's style; he doesn't do action or fluff. He gets to the heart of the humanity in his stories. The narrative voice-overs from multiple characters may seem abstract, but they reveal what is at stake. If 75% of our communication is non-verbal, these voice-overs help us truly understand what is on the screen. For example, Farrell's character doesn't talk much. But we know what he's thinking thanks to Malick's artistic style. If you like Malick, you will like this film. If you don't, well ... you just might think this is the worst movie ever made. Christian Bale is a little under-utilized, as is David Thewlis, but everyone can't get the juicy roles.",The New World
114,wjfickling,Visually beautiful--if you can stay awake,6,26 June 2007,"This film tells the familiar story of Pocahontas, Powhatan, John Smith, and John Rolfe in a manner appears to be intended to be more historically accurate than most of the fantasized versions of the story that have been depicted over the years. For the most part, it succeeds, with some glaring exceptions. Malick's most daring venture was to cast a 14 year old actress in the role of Pocahantas, which puts her not far from the age--traditionally 12--that the real Pocahontas was at the time she intervened to save Smith's life. The young actress is half Indian and half Caucasian; I guess they couldn't find a full-blooded Indian for the part. The first disconcerting note, at least for this viewer, occurs fairly early in the film when Pocahontas raises her arms and we see that her armpits are shaved. An Indian girl, in 1607? Not likely! This inattention to detail threw me out of the film's frame of reference, reminding me that I was watching a film and that this is an actress who, even at this tender age, can't allow her image to be besmirched by being filmed with hairy underarms.The film is visually beautiful, as Malick's films usually are. The camera glides over some of the pastoral scenes, and we get a sense--as we are clearly meant to--of how pristine and unspoiled the North America was before the white man came. The actors in the three principal parts all perform competently and are successful at conveying their thoughts and feelings nonverbally. They don't have much choice, because there is very little dialogue. And, thankfully, the Indians are not portrayed as saintly or noble, but quite accurately as people going about their business who are alternately fascinated by and fearful of these intruders. They rightfully foresee that the settlers might not want much now, but they might want much more later.So, the film has much to recommend it. But it has a fatal flaw: it is excruciatingly slooooooooooooooooooow and boooooooooooooooooooring. It could easily have been pared by a third and edited to an hour and a half length. Instead it plods on for two and a quarter hours, long long after I had come to appreciate the visual poetry and had gotten its obvious points (in case you don't know what they are, this film will be a delight for tree huggers and cultural relativists).In the final analysis, I suppose the film is worth seeing, but have a few strong cups of coffee before you do.",The New World
115,EvLauster,"Exquisite slice of dramatic geography, Farrell suits himself nicely along side Malick",8,8 May 2006,"*** Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, O'Orianka Kilcher, Wes Studi, Jamie Harris. Directed by Terrence Malick Normally a redundant story line involving a feud and then settlement between settlers and a Native Tribe. This time focusing on John Smith (Farrell), who upon capture is brought back to the tribes leader. But instead of death, leads him to a chemistry between a young girl Pocahontas (Kilcher). Sound familiar? If it does, it probably reminds you of 2003's ""Last Samuri"" where upon capture is taught the ways and language of the local's. Malick does a fine job making an exquisite slice of 17th century dramatic geography. And Bale although not receiving as much screen time as he should, going double for Plummer still do a fine job. Despite some of Farrell's recent projects which left me bored, ""New World"" is beautiful in cinematography and acting. Which leads me to be astounded that more Oscar nominations was not received.",The New World
116,samseescinema,a deep artistic pleasure,9,15 December 2005,"The New World reviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3.5 out of 4 Filing out of The New World, completely speechless and without notes, I could fathom only single adjectives to describe the experience. Looking at these listed words on my memo-pad now, they read ""Thunderous, True, Beautiful, Solemn, Forceful, Gripping, Honest, and Slow."" And for those who watch The New World with a calm countenance, an open mind and a ready cache of patience, Terrence Malick's long-awaited picture will have a similar effect. The film is a masterpiece thirty years in the making. His goal is plain enough: to affectively and honestly portray the love Pocahontas experienced in those first years that Europeans cut their first, fresh swath from the New World. But Malick goes far beyond a simplistic love story. I was at the screening for Casanova a few days earlier, where the film's objective was essentially the same: to portray the love between Casanova and Francesca in the days of Inquisition Venice. But where Casanova approaches love at a bubbly, comedic perspective, The New World throws itself into a headlong narration of love's sorrow. Every frame of The New World reflects this painful, aching emotion, utilizing the sounds and images of environment to incredible, innovative effect. The first shot of the film--an extended shot several minutes in length--finds the camera staring into a river. It's clear and pristine, carefree and surrounded by the blissful sounds of an unperturbed forest. Soon ripples begin forming, and we notice the quiet droplets of rain pit-pattering around us, causing the water to flow a little, bringing about a contented onslaught of lily pedals. The scene continues on, drawing us farther and farther into Malick's deafening reality with only the sounds and images of nature. He creates a calm within us with these images, a kind of serene canvas for him to later paint the vivid brush-strokes of human love later in the film. In this entire first act, little is even said. But these scenes rarely grow tiring. He finds rich beauty with every situation. His forest is lush and his settlements picturesquely Dickensian. Malick shows great and rare confidence with this picture. Few filmmakers would have the cool audacity to create a film so primarily reliant on nothing being said. The first and most important of Pocahontas' (Q'Orianka Kilcher) romances is with the infamous John Smith (Colin Farrell). He's brought to the New World bound in a cage, punished for earlier mutiny. But because he's the only soldier of the expedition, Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) opts to let him free on a strict probation. Their first encounters with the Naturals, as they're called, go coolly enough, with curious interest from the Naturals and tense hesitation from the settlers. And even here Malick plays with flights of romantic whimsy. These scenes of first encounter are shot in windswept, overgrown grassy fields, with Pocahontas dancing and twirling about them with her brother, catching the spry interest of Smith.Soon the settlers hear of a great city of Naturals down the river, and Smith is sent to investigate. Things have been going badly for the settlers and Captain Newport has left back for London and a new store of food and supplies. Smith's expedition is cut short, however, when he runs into a narrow, maze-like complex of swamps and is ambushed by warrior Naturals. He's taken prisoner by the Naturals, but granted life because of Pocahontas' curious interest and her favoritism with Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg). This catalyzes our entrance into The New World's most prominent territory. The scenes of Smith's time with the Naturals are Malick's best. They're those first strokes of paint on his canvas and the seeds of that palpable, historical romance.But admittedly, even with The New World's supreme sense of confidence and slow-moving progression, it sometimes wanders into the realm of self-indulgence. It especially grows tiresome in the final act, when we're brought from Virginia to London, our beloved Smith left behind to be replaced by John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and his stonewall courting of Pocahontas. I'd even venture to say that Malick could have left 30 minutes of these segments on the editing room floor, re-attaching them later to the Extended Cut DVD release that's sure to come. But movie-going patience is the mantra of the Awards season, and so some bottom-dragging in films is what's to be expected.What was not to be expected, however, was Q'Orianka Kilcher, the debuting actress playing Pocahontas. Few words she says, but dialogue is not always what makes a forceful performance. Her body language and expressions are allowed to do the speaking for her. She's advantaged also by her strong, muscular features that often betray hints of divine femininity. Farrell also does well, particularly in his somber narration. He reads it as though he speaks the words to himself, whispering them almost, for only his imagination to hear. But his physicality is manipulated nicely as well, exuding bubbly chemistry for Kilcher. The two mix ideally. Their sorrow and love and deeply resonated emotions are echoed about with their strong performances and Malick's supreme direction. And although Christian Bale strides into picture in the latter parts of the film, our hearts lie with Smith and Pocahontas, and we find ourselves resentful of Rolfe's advances. But this is just Malick's narrative trickery. We find ourselves raggedly torn between these two equally honorable men, and put almost into the same position as Pocahontas. It's precisely the reason we go to the movies. We've let the director take his grip on us and lead us down the path into characters and identities of his own creation. And with Malick leading our way, and with characters as tastefully dimensional as these, movie-going becomes a deep artistic pleasure.",The New World
117,Gloede_The_Saint,Malicks shame.,6,30 November 2007,"Now, just to get one thing totally clear before you read the rest. I love Terrence Malick, he's one of my favorite directors who sadly only have made 4 films. OK, perhaps I had high expectations to it seeing how both The Thin Red Line and Badlands are in my top 50 but this film where just a major mistake. My main problem with it where partly, ""It where boring"", and coming from me most average movie goers probably died. I prefer it to move slow, I even prefer anti-climaxes over climaxes, but I was almost bored to tears with this one. I where so surprised that Malick where unable to create beauty or excitement into this. The frames where basically dead and the cinematography what you would expect from your average nobody for not to mention the poor editing. Now this is mostly not Malicks fault but he should at least have worked with talented people. The acting where very wooden to and Jesus Christ that screenplay lacked any sense of true dept. I'm sad to say this fellow Malick fans but I think the man failed delivering what he could have made and although it wasn't much to start with he could have made it into a great film, sadly he didn't. I'm looking forward to his next film though, seeing how soon after this it actually comes I hope its a sign on that he knows what crappy job he did and that he's now trying to make it OK again. I just have to say this: The New World bored me and I'm the guy who's at the end of his seat watching Stalker and 2001, two movies generally bashed for being slow. This film where lacking all qualities of Malicks previous work and I'm extremely sad to say I can't go higher that a 6/10, and thats being extremely nice.",The New World
118,eastbergholt2002,"Slow, Boring and Pretentious",3,5 February 2006,"The New World received good reviews from several well known critics and the trailers seemed intriguing. Unfortunately this was the least enjoyable film I've seen in a long time. I felt I had a duty to warn the public about this slow, boring, incoherent and dimwitted work of genius. In 1607, three small English ships arrive in what became Jamestown. Life is hard and John Smith (Colin Farrell) befriends the local Indians, especially the chief's daughter. After a while, Smith is given another assignment by the King of England and he disappears from the movie. John Rolfe (Chritian Bale) arrives and becomes friendly with Pocohantas. They build a house together and become farmers. At the request of the King, they leave America and spend time in England. while this is going on the English are exploiting the Indians and treating them badly.This is a well known story, but the director managed to construct a movie with little plot or dialog. The actors mostly mumble at each other. The lack of dialog makes it difficult to understand the characters or what motivates them. Occasionally the actors would reveal their inner thoughts with pretentious and unintelligible monologues. The pace is glacial and has random shots of trees, fields and water. Characters are inserted into the story with no introduction. Who was John Smith and why did the King of England regard him so highly. Why did his fellow colonists treat him so badly. We are told Smith was a professional soldier but he didn't seem to be a man with any natural authority, charisma or leadership qualities. Farrell looked confused and depressed, perhaps he was thinking about his recent career choices. His accent was a strange mixture of Irish and English west country. The Christian Bale character was well connected and the house he occupies with Pocohantas in England is enormous. So it wasn't clear why Bale and Rebecca wanted to return ""home"" to Virginia and live in a shack in a swamp. Also, why was Pocahontas called Rebecca? There was little chemistry between any of the romantic leads so it was difficult to believe in the love stories. On the positive side, the cinematography was beautiful and the costumes looked realistic. James Horner's classical score was excellent. The movie seemed like the work of an amateur with a budget which seemed cobbled together in the editing room. Judging from the other reviews I probably didn't get it.",The New World
119,MovieZoo,The New World wows with wonder and beauty,9,21 January 2006,"I'll cut right to the end of the journey that is this review. I wanted to give it a 10 but didn't because of the ending. The ending should have followed the path the rest of the movie took. It is only because they got to the end and seemingly just decided to succumb to destiny that I did not give it a 10. The movie started out so beautifully, I almost began to wonder if National Geographic had actually found a time machine and went back to the time of Pochahontas. And while the scenery was beautiful, I am not referring only to the scenery being beautiful. I truly felt the movie's intent was to make the viewer believe he/she was being born into this time in history - acknowledging the presence of wondrous scenery and the mystery of humanity.I found it hard to compare it with any other movie I have ever seen. Try to remember the days of your innocence and you may find the same feelings while watching The New World.No performer performed so beautifully as Q'Orianka Kilcher. I will be disappointed if she doesn't at least get nominated for teen awards next year. Neither Colin Farrell nor Christian Bale impressed me but I do believe it was intentional to make their characters less attractive than Pochahontas.Just remember when you see this movie, if you want to enjoy and understand it, view it as you are just being introduced to a new world for the first time. Q'Orianka Kilcher will take you along with her gladly.BTW, the violence is nearly nothing more than gratuitous so don't expect violence to provide satisfaction.Beautiful job, Terrence Malick!!",The New World
120,MacAindrais,With all deliberate speed- over your head and under your feet,10,24 January 2006,"The New World: ****Terrence Malick's fourth film in thirty-two years is 'The New World.' It's based upon the John Smith/Pocahontas tales, but this is no live action Disney production. Malick wrote the script back in the 70's and finally puts it on film here in 2005(6). Pocahontas is played by newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher, in a wonderful turn as Pochahontas. Colin Farrell, plays John Smith, doing probably his strong work. And of no big surprise, Christian Bale also does some of his best work here playing the future husband of Pocahontas (or Rebbecca as the English rename her). None of the actors here really have a lot of dialog to work with, so Malick has them express and convey their emotions through body language. It works to magnificently. Some people clearly were bored with the movie due to this reason, but this isn't your average film. It reaches out and wants to make you feel like you are really there. And the fact that there is little dialog, outside of Malick's trademark voice overs, makes this possible. You don't have overly talky situations in real life, and often the most meaningful gestures are expressed without words. Nothing is said here for the purpose of filler.Just like every other Malick film, 'The New World' is chalk full of symbolism. Just as every word spoken on screen is full of meaning, every image Malick inserts in his film means something. Most movies take the easy way out and explain these things for you in the end. Not Malick. He relies on his imagery to tell his hidden philosophical points. Emmanuel Lubezki takes the reins on the camera and does a beautiful job. With each film Malick has used a different cinematographer, but his visual style is always evident. Crew members have often spoke of Malick's almost preternatural understanding of cinematography. The look of his films are his own. He establishes dogmas of cinematography: for The New World, only steadicam or hand-held shots were to be used, and the cameraman was encouraged to move on his own to find the rhythm of the shot, among other things. This movie is not for everyone. Malick's movies, all four of them, move very slowly. But they do so with all deliberate speed. Malick has a way of lulling you into almost a hypnosis with his flowing camera movements and editing style. It makes you feel closer to the real story, and it does make his movies feel longer than they actually are, in that rarely positive way. They draw you in so that you are there, in that world. If you have it in you to allow yourself to be taken in, the payoff to be found is deeply rewarding.The plot to 'The New World' is easy enough. Everyone will get the basic pattern here. Understanding the big picture, however, is a whole other story. Malick, more-so than many other directors, has a way of getting under your feet and over your head. This is very frustrating for many people who are expecting a classic narrative style. For those with the willingness to allow Malick to take you in and let the film run over you, then 'The New World' will be unforgettable.",The New World

122,Balthazar-5,Prepare yourself for something spiritual,10,27 January 2006,"OK, I'm a massive admirer of Terrence Malick. I think he is the greatest living filmmaker. His films touch part of my psyche that are left unmoved by any other filmmaker. But... Nothing, repeat NOTHING prepared me for the sensory explosion that is The New World. I had been following the production for over 18 months, watching the trailer online... counting the days... But I was worried. Some suggestions that Malick have over-reached himself, was self-indulgent... And Malick's style of cinema is so fragile, it could fall apart. So with optimism, but trepidation I took the plunge... and - oh joy, oh bliss, this is truly heaven. Why is it so wonderful? The only word I can give is that it, unlike any film that I have seen since the death of Bresson (except, maybe, Flowers of Shanghai), is deeply, deeply spiritual. We have familiar Malick motifs - the wind on the grass, the shots of the sky reflected in water from The Thin Red Line - but here that take on a completely new and more satisfying meaning, for Malick's concern is with man in his purest communion with nature. The 'naturals' are precisely that - at one with nature. Malick uses his poetic imagery to set our senses aglow with the sheer wonder and of purity of the indigenous lifestyle. This is cinema at the level of what I can only term 'super-expression' - imagery communicates complex interaction between things and the way our senses perceive them, but it does so at an incredibly elevated level. The most remarkable thing for the casual viewer is how much Malick manages to express complex and wonderful things completely without dialogue. John Smith (Colin Farrell) barely speaks to his own people, let alone his indigenous captors. Yet we sense what he is thinking through Malick's absolutely magnificent use of imagery and sound.There are other motifs. People hold hands. They express themselves through their breathing. And, yet again, Malick has found a wonderful vehicle for his vision in the form of Q'Orianka Kilcher. Her screen presence and the range of emotions that she suggests with so little dialogue is little short of miraculous.For people who love the cinema not just on the basis of the quality of the stories that it tells, but the manner in which it tells them, this must be one of the films of the decade. Many people have said that the cinema is like a language, but that is to belittle it. It is not like A language, it is simply like language itself. And just as there are many languages, there are many cinemas - that is forms of cinema. And in each language there are masters of the language who excel in expressing themselves in poetry and in prose. In English we had Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde. Now, in 'poetic cinema' at a higher level even than Stan Brakhage, we have Terrence Malick. Yes, The New World is THAT good. See it. See it. See it.",The New World
123,gpeltz,Stunning work,9,31 January 2006,"We are familiar with the tale of the founding of the first English Colony at Jamestown, Virginia in the year 1607. Most likely we do not give it much thought. It's story resides in musty text books and High School history class memories. Whereas the names of Pocahontas, John Smith and the Indian Chief Powhatan live on in legend, little else than the recollection that the princess saved the life of the John Smith from her father can be brought to mind. This pinpoint in history has permeated our consciousness through popular media, Songs like, ""Fever"" tell of the love of Pocahontas, and movies such as the recent Disney animated tale, repeat the telling.Director Terrence Malick, in his movie, ""The New World"" uses his unique vision, and presents us not so much an historical chronology, nor a torrid love story, but rather an acutely observed, yet impressionistic vision of the events that transpired from the first contacts of the colonists with the Indians, to the establishment of a viable settlement.The early scenes depicting interactions between Smith's men, and the curious yet unpredictable, ""naturals"" are striking. The directors style allows the viewer to share in the wonders and discoveries of the new world and it's people, we see how it must have looked. Fear and wonder are intertwined as we view the clash of the cultures.Director Malick is a visual poet. This is a movie of moods; lights and shadows painted by nature are overlaid with the historical events that transpired. Details are keenly observed as well as historically accurate. The look of the film is authentic and well researched, Yet Malick is after more than just a historical narrative. It is telling, that the name Pocahontas is never spoken, rather we see the young girl, playing in the fields, a beautiful sight, and one that captivates us, as well as John Smith. Nor is the narration linear, we first experience events through the eyes of John Smith as played by Colin Farrell, we hear his thoughts in voice-over. The narrative switches later on, to Pocahontas, played by the young Q'Orianka Kilcher. She says very little at first, but is eloquent with her movements and expressions. Her character grows from playful and curious, to sober and pensive, as she assimilates into the Colonists life style. Late in the film, the narrative switches once more, to another character, John Rolfe, Pocahontas's suitor played wistfully by Christian Bale.Although set in the sixteen hundreds, Malicks tale stylistically reminds me of Stanley Kubric's classic, ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" in it's presentation and telling. Most particularly with it's use of music and sound. Composer James Horner has created a score subtle sometimes, even minimalist, yet when combined with the cinematography, undeniably powerful.The film runs a long and leisurely 135 minutes. The tempo of the movie is deliberate, and I did not mind as the director lingered on a sunset or the play of water to help establish a mood. The pristine shots of Virginia's natural beauty, and the sound design capturing the sounds of a meadow, alive with birds and animals calls, creates with bold strokes a natural yet unfamiliar tableau.The film covers an undetermined passage of time, and what we see, advances time in jumps and spurts, The film lingers on the early contacts of settlers and Indians. We experience the beginnings of the settlement, through the first bitter cold winter, then the film jumps ahead to a later point where the settlers have to defend themselves against harrowing attacks as the Indians realize that these visitors intend to stay. We see the fledgling colony grow, and trade established with several tribes. There is even a visit to England, and the court of King James the first, by Pocahontas and John Rolfe, that provides contrast from the rustic life in the Colony.If you are short of attention, and the thought of a movie without special effects worries you, it would be best to let this film pass, but if you are open to Malick's vision, the film experience is indeed akin to discovering a new world. I give this one **** and a half stars out of five.",The New World
124,adamshl,Mallik's Singular Vision,5,3 December 2008,"This film didn't seem to be as much about history as rather his-story. In this case, it's all about Mallik's personal concept of what might have happened. While all of this is diverting, for me it didn't have the ring of factual authenticity.What it does have are very beautiful photographic images. It's been reported that some million feet of film was used to render the finished product. So there was much footage from which to select for the final cut, and this was done with the greatest of care.Unfortnately, I didn't get much involved on an emotional level. The characters seemed set down amidst attractive scenery and revolved around the periphery of a striking production, rather than driving the action forward.There were two very long musical sequences that employed an undulating upper brass atop a lower brass drone that seemed to last forever (brasses used in this manner get old very quickly). Then there was a Mozart piano concerto excerpt that struck me as rather incongruous to early settlers in a new land with military fortresses and Indian villages.In the end, technique seemed to rein over expression, which amounted to a most attractive production without much emotional substance.",The New World
125,Scoval71,I Could Not Get into This,5,26 January 2007,"Sorry, I just did not get into this movie. Not a movie, a poem, as another reviewer wrote, maybe more of a documentary. Something is not right with this movie---it is like watching a filmstrip in elementary school. I found it long winded, rather dull, boring. It is difficult to understand the mumblings of the characters. The Hollywood makeup of the ""naturals"" was evident. The casting was all right, I guess, but I just found myself waiting for it to be all over already. The scene where Pocahontas (and funny, she is never called Pocahontas in the movie---who would know if they were not familiar with her story?) is dressed in English finery is very realistic. Not so are the tattoos on Farrell's arms. Again, it is a visual masterpiece, but I just could not get into it, and readily see why it failed miserably. Not a go here. Very difficult to understand the speech.",The New World
126,cdelacroix1,The Story of Pocohontas,7,7 February 2006,"I finally got around to seeing this movie and for me it was interesting in many ways but disappointing in many ways as well. Still, this movie gives both an interesting, quiet glimpse of a New World ... and uses this to deliver a deeply appealing Story of Pocahontas ... and this is the Story that really drives the movie, IMHO.I like the cinematography ... especially the very moving, very convincing initial glimpses of the New World; and almost all of the visual scenes in England.Acting is generally OK. With one important exception: Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocohontas/Rebecca. This young lady is simply superb in my opinion. She has a wonderfully winsome quality about her, a lovely smile, and as it transpired ... to my surprise ... that this movie becomes above all *her* story ... she carries off this really very complex role with an appealingly convincing authority from start to finish. What a wonderful characterization. Many thanks, Ms. Kilcher! The depiction of the Native Americans ... innovatively styled the ""Naturals"" in the movie ... is to me very appealing and interesting but also (alas) too steeped in the Noble Savage tradition for my own taste. The early Bad Europeans vs Good Natives depiction is simply unconvincing.The music at the beginning and toward the end seems to me to support the developments and mood very well indeed. However, narrative and inner voicings sometimes sound simply too loud. Some of the things said I couldn't make out; I don't know if that's just me or not ... but that happened so much that I wondered if either sound was defective, or direction perhaps erred in permitting slovenly enunciation.The script, unfortunately, seems to me very poor and very unconvincing ... there are simply an enormous number of ""holes"" that kept challenging my attempt to surrender to the movie's imaginative depiction of history. The sort of Romeo & Juliet depiction of Pocohontas & John Smith is fine by me, but adding in a full scale love triangle to me needlessly complicates what is already a very full plot.The polyvocalization and the ""stream of consciousness"" scene sequences in the middle do not really work very well for me at all. The slow, steady pace seems to me to drag at times. And I don't know when last I've seen a ""mainstream"" movie that seemed so laconic. Plain vocal communication was amazingly sparse; too sparse.The overall contrast between the New World in America and the New World in England to me does make for a wonderful taste of one view of the history of the period. The clash of cultures and the historical setting make a truly wonderful context for this wonderful story of Kilcher/Pocohontas. Themes of individual and history, and choice and destiny, of truth and dream, are all woven into both the historical/cultural contest and the personal Story of Pocohontas in a very appealing way despite the drawbacks mentioned above.",The New World
127,Movieguy_blogs_com,Could they have made this story any more boring?,4,24 January 2006,"In 'The New World' newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher plays the legendary Pocahontas. She is intrigued by the visitors that have come to her peoples' land. She is charged with the task of learning as much as she can about the strangers from the one they call John Smith (Colin Farrell). But she does more than that, she will fall in love and it will change her life forever.Could they have made this story any more boring? I suppose they could have used really bad actors, but that is about it. There should have been at least a half an hour shaved off the running time. There are scenes that just do not go anywhere. Also, the music does not seem to fit the mood of the film. In the beginning and end is sounded loud and annoying.In it's defense, both Colin Farrell and Q'Orianka Kilcher did a remarkable job in the picture. The visuals are really good; something the director (Terrence Malick) is known for. But unless you are a fan of Malick, I would not see this movie.",The New World
128,Pasafist,A Brave and Powerful Film,9,20 January 2006,"Something happened in the 80's. There was a defining moment that systematically changed how people look at the world. I didn't know it then but when my teachers told me of the first Thanksgiving and the story of Indians and Pilgrims living together in a peace in harmony little did I discover that it was all a lie. By the time I got out of Elementary school I heard the heartbreaking story of how the white man killed every last Native American with extreme malice. So what was the truth, who was at fault? It was only after years of figuring out just how history works that I came to the conclusion that (for the most part) History is rarely black and white and the monsters and heroes that have become part of the story are rarely as monstrous or heroic as they seem.That's what makes Terence Malick's THE NEW WORLD so bold. It doesn't try to tell a story about America, but he tells a story of two people trapped between themselves and the world that continues to change around them. You will find little here about how horrible Europeans are or how savage the Native Americans are, instead you get a lyrical poem about the simple curiosity that must have come over the Native Americans and European Settlers at the birth of America.THE NEW WORLD begins just as America does at the dawn of the Jamestown Colony. Its 1607 and two ship has dropped off the men who will successfully settle the land. Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) is sent to the local Native Tribe to make friends and alliances for their very survival. He meets and falls for Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) who asks her father the king to spare Smith's life. On Pocahontas' instance the King helps the men of the Jamestown settlement survive their first winter, but disowns his daughter after he realizes these men are not leaving.Terrence Malick has crafted a beautiful film. The score is lush, the photography beautiful, and the performances are just golden. At the heart of this film is a simple (and yet dramatically complicated) love story. I could have been set anywhere, in fact hundreds of films have dealt with the theme. But Malick gives us characters worth rooting for and embracing and a story that is told simply and beautiful.Q'Orianka Kilcher embodies Pocahantas with such a sweet demeanor and striking curiosity. She is strong, and joyful, and seems unfazed by the world around her. I loved the scenes when she goes to England. Somehow her performance, which was so raw and passionate, made me believe she had never seen Western Civilization before. She is the lynch pin to this film and somehow carries it with an amount of courage and yet a simple aloofness. She makes acting look easy.Malick also wisely doesn't pull the story down by cluttering it with dread, or political correctness. Some will probably argue that the film turns a blind eye to the suffering cause by 17th Century Colonialism. But that's not what this film is about. THE NEW WORLD is about a girl, who becomes a women at a time when the world was changing.The film is also about groups of people exploring each other for the first time. The Settlers and the Native people don't have histories baggage to hold them back. They are simple men and women trying to figure out who these strange people are that have moved into their neighborhood. It's amazing to watch, the outcome of this history can and will be discussed for years and years. But THE NEW WORLD is not that forum.I have my qualms with the end of the film. The story could have been a little stronger, but because the characters have so much heart and the film is so beautiful I didn't mind. At the end of the day plot developments are pointless, when you have Characters with heart and power. THE NEW WORLD is a film worth watching, and embracing. It's a strong character driven tale that is both bold and daring simply because it chooses heart over politics",The New World
129,fastmike,"Gitchee, but not Gumee",6,5 June 2006,"There is a lot of good and bad to be said about this 20th century reality view of 'the Indian Princess', Pocahontas. First off, it seems to be another in a long line of 'east meets west' culture clash movies. (In this case, the Europeans are the 'east') The cinematography itself is beautiful, and the style manor and detail of costume and set will give you a 'glimpse' of the people of the time of King James.There are some notable performances too, not award winning, but notable. ""Q"" Kilcher is, indeed gorgeous, and gives a fine portrait of 'prancing' Pocahantas. It is to her misfortune, however, that director Malick might of been a little too focused on her, and the end result is that it looks like a three hour screen test of Kilcher.Colin Farrell proves he has talent indeed! Throughout the entire film, he wears an unflinching expression of a man who has forgotten something important, and just can't remember what it is.Wes Studi adds another native American performance to a long list in his Hollywood career. Mr. Studi should be given an award for his portrayal of Native Americans throughout the years, because no one person has done more than Mr. Studi to dispel the 'typical' Hollywood 'cowboy and Indian' portrayal of Native Americans. Even when he has played the 'heavy', the portrait is strong and dignified. Overall, it's pleasing entertainment, that could have been a 'lot shorter', and will entertain the history buff, but seems to be headed for the shelf in the wake of more exciting summer entertainment",The New World
130,coljam21,My favorite film,10,7 July 2013,"I have watched this movie well over a dozen times since I saw it in the theater in 2005. I was mesmerized then and am still mesmerized every time I watch it. This movie is simply art. Watching it is like watching a painting, a beautiful painting.Terrance Malick directed this film brilliantly. I still find it hard to believe that he was able to film in such a pristine and perfect location to film. There is not much dialogue in the movie but it doesn't need any. You can clearly tell what the movie is about without having to listen to a script.What can I say? I just love this movie. The beauty and purity of it always brings me to tears. I am always deeply moved when I watch this. Such a visceral film",The New World
131,fred-houpt,Completely overwhelming experience,10,25 December 2006,"I own ""The Thin Red Line"" and I've watched it a few times and so I have a feeling for what Malick can do with images. What struck me on the first viewing of TNW is that it appears from one angle to be a continuation of an extended meditation in film that began (at least to my limited knowledge) with TTRL. The shots upward into the trees, the swaying effects of the wind on grasses and leaves; the movement, constant movement of water, trees, air, waves in the ocean. If you keep TTRL in your mind when you watch TNW you'll feel a similar pulse, a similar eye that is looking and thinking and creating. Malick is not just presenting history; this is the backdrop, so it would seem. The point of his movies is to draw us all deep, very deep into the mystery and drama of life; how random it can all seem amidst so much chaos, so orderly amidst so much destruction; how tender amongst so much darkness. Malick is not interested in the mindless Hollywood that gives you gratuitous blood, lots of noise and after it is over you forget, you are hardly touched, the fantasy is as important as a bowl of popcorn. Malick is taking life and drawing us into the minds of those who are stretched out like paint on a canvas. We either sit still and are touched or we walk out of the cinema, unable to stand something that is substantial, that is philosophical, that is putting us through deep empathy right into the lives of the actors. If you are up that close you can suddenly get goosebumps, in sympathy with the moment, somehow you too are there. How often does this happen in our movie experiences? Like almost never, right? Let's get back to the basics of the film. Is it historically accurate? Not really. I did some reading up on ""Pocahontas"" and her story, after I had watched the film. American history has heaped a lot of layers of embellishments on her story and that happens all the time to characters who are put high on pedestal's, who are exaggerated into larger than normal, larger than life proportions. She did exist, that's for sure. However, there seems to be some consensus that she did not have the sort of romantic relationship that is depicted in this movie. I think it is wrong to put the microscope of historical reality to this film; I don't think Malick had a documentary in mind. If he did then the movie would be worthy of such criticism and analysis. Instead what we have here is a powerful drama that just sweeps you away.I am now remembering the effect that ""The Mission"" had on me. In that film de Niro's character pulls so much of the story on to his back that almost everyone else in the film is subservient to his suffering. The natives in that film, for sure, are just pretty eye-candy and have little direct contact with moving the plot along. In TNW the native American's are directly engaged in the development of the plot and in the middle of that tension Pocahontas endures. What is elemental and pure in TNW is that there is a spark of love between Smith and her and though he runs from it and her, she cannot deny what they shared.It is a complicated drama because in this version of the story she is very attached to Smith whereas in reality she might not have been. Nevertheless, the story is told with great sensitivity and we mourn her losses as they accumulate. Hers is a sad story and it never abates, even after her seeing Smith again.What we are left with are the images, the depiction of the Powhatten natives, their impressions of the Europeans and how filthy, uncouth and foul the Europeans appear. There are layers of loss of innocence and Malick knows that a modern viewer might be unaware that the conquest of the United States came at the terrible suffering of the natives. Perhaps it is this and less the length of the film that makes people so uncomfortable with this film? There are many long scenes that have no dialog. None is needed. We are just so acclimatized to verbal dialog, too much talking. Can we please remember that movies began with ""silent"" films, where people expressed with their eyes, there facial gestures. The young actress Q'Orianka Kilcher is able to emote depths of feeling that just make words unnecessary. The same is true for Smith (Colin Ferrel). He does not need to speak much. Malick has them ""act"" with their eyes. For me this just added to the poetry of his film.I was just blown away by this movie. It is a deeply sad film but Pocahontas's story is that way. Malick has again painted a movie rather than just go through the motions. The soundtrack is as overwhelming as the visual images. To quote from another review on Amazon: ""The use of Wagner's Vorspiel from the opera Das Rheingold, along (with) Mozart's famous Piano Concerto #23, are stunning and essential elements to this remarkable film.""So I will stop for now as there is much more to be said. I want to watch it again a few times more. This is a very powerful and wonderful film that is worth the appreciation of a fine opera, symphony or art on a huge canvas. Wonderful.",The New World

133,Ryu_Darkwood,Being high on peyote must give a similar feeling,6,10 June 2007,"I made the incredible mistake of thinking this movie would be like '' Tristan & Isolde. That it'd be the kind of epic war tale that Hollywoodstudios tend to make once in a while; action-packed romance while being light-hearted and funny at the same time. It wasn't...Completely ignorant of the complexity of this movie I watched it with a group of friends. None of them highly educated on ''the better movie'', probably not knowing that Fellini isn't an Italian sports car, thinking that a good movie has to be full of action, tits and gore and that drama is for women or gay people. So, to summarize my thoughts, the usual mainstream crowd. They thought that this movie sucked, and I can't blame them. So to be honest, maybe my judgment is colored by their negative response during the movie.I myself am very fond of the first ten minutes of '' Once upon a time in the west ''. Building up the tension by just showing some strong visual imagery, like the turning wheel of the windmill, a fly bothering a man and people waiting for things to come. '' The new world '' is like this; rather than having dialog or action in it, it tries to tell a story by showing images of nature and people staring to each other. But unlike '' Once upon...'' this isn't just a phase of the movie, this is everything, this is THE movie. It makes this picture very inaccessible and boring. It also doesn't help that the few lines of dialog in it are just some random thoughts about love, like: Pocahontas: He is like a tree. He shelters me. I lie in his shade, or, Pocahontas: Mother, why can I not feel as I should... must? Once false, I must not be again. Take out the thorn.It's like all the main characters are high on peyote and in their highness try to say something worthy about life and love. It felt like complete randomness to me.Okay, so far all of the bad things about this movie, I must also say that at times I felt like it was film-making in its purest form. I really adored the scenes in which John Smith learned English to Pocahontas, or, when Pocahontas is seeing the cold and dirty England for the first time in her life. These sporadic moments levitate the movie to a higher level, but they don't make up for the boring feeling the movie as a whole gives.",The New World
134,el_monty_BCN,Pure Malick... and it almost worked!,6,25 February 2006,"SPOILERS GALOREI went to see this film knowing full well what I was getting into. I know that Malick's unmistakable style can be both a blessing and a curse; he is able to create absolutely beautiful scenes that have the power to stay in your mind, but his storytelling pace and his penchant for getting distracted with a tiny flower growing at the edge of the road can be infuriating. I was ready to be enchanted, but I also knew there was a high risk of, well, being bored. Still, it's Malick, and I had to see it. And the thing is, during the first half of the film, I wasn't bored at all, I was enjoying it tremendously. You could recognize Malick in every carefully constructed frame, of course, but I felt the pace was brisk (at least by his standards), things kept happening, and this story, about culture clashes, communication without words, life in the wild, and the assault on an environment, was an absolutely perfect fit for his particular filming style. And the falling in love was beautiful... nobody does intimacy like Malick. It felt like it was going to be a great variation of Romeo & Juliet (it even has the detail of the girl's brother getting killed by the enemy). And I thought I was finally going to thoroughly enjoy a Malick film from start to finish, something I've always wanted to do but have found myself unable to. But alas, it was not to be. And the problem for me was not in the pace, but in the story. We suddenly enter a second half in which John Smith leaves, and the love story is over. All we're left with is Pocahontas's loneliness, her progressive adaptation to western life, her passionless marriage to Rolfe, and the inexorable growth of Jamestown. Which is all fine, and I suppose also more or less historically accurate, but just not nearly as interesting. The story just loses its drive. And even when Pocahontas learns that her true love is still alive... well, nothing much happens either! So once again I found myself feeling bored, despite my efforts not to, and despite Q'Orianka Kilcher's magnificent performance. A pity then, because it is a fine film, as you would expect, but it feels to me like an opportunity missed. Still, it has many virtues and eventually I will want to see it again, because I know I always appreciate Malick's films better in a second viewing, when I'm aware of the turns that the story is going to take. And we're probably gonna have to wait 10 years for the next Malick film anyway..!PS: Oh, and I LOVED James Horner's music. I didn't know where to mention it, but I just had to say it!",The New World
135,mfsor,Astonishing,9,2 February 2006,"The lushness of early Virginia, the beauty of an English garden were the two highlights of this film. Smith could have talked some more, that would have livened up this movie. Nevermind. Just the sense of being in Elizabethan (everybody European grew up under her) first colony was impressive. I don't know why some reviewer thought Pocahantas was anti-Christian or anti-European just because she prayed a little bit out the mansion window. She said that the garden was where her deceased mother was and that's deeper.The Indians seemed too over-painted, but I don't know the history of that myself. They looked too much like NFL designs. The surprise of the Indians when the ships arrived was also very well done. It dragged a bit during the middle. Kilcher is a superb actress.

136,funky_cherry86,A True Masterpiece,9,2 August 2006,"After seeing The New World it is one of the most outstanding films ever made in the history of cinema director Terrence Malick has created a wonderful story with great scenery and a dedicated group of actors.Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher played the role of Pocahontas beautifully and delivered an Oscar worthy performance, Colin Farrell & Christian Bale were fantastic as John Smith & John Rolfe the two men who captured her heart. I've only seen one other film that was directed by Terrence Malick and it was 1973's Badlands since then this is the second film of his that has captured my attention.The year is 1607 Captain Christopher Newport(Plummer) is leading a group of 103 men aboard three ships on a journey across the sea to a small native village to reach an agreement with the local tribe for a piece of land.Among them is John Smith (Farrell) a 27 year old troublemaker about to be hanged for some petty crimes, Newport stops the hanging on the condition that Smith continue to lead the men on that mission. However when he is captured by the tribe and about to die Pocahontas (Kilcher)the young daughter of chief Powhatan (Schellenberg) saves his life and the chief allows this stranger to teach his child about the world across the ocean and the English language.Pretty soon a powerful bond forms between the couple that is stronger than love and friendship but after an attack on the Indians Powhatan sends his youngest child away to another village forever so she won't be killed. Smith returns home , however not too soon after his departure Pocahontas receives the tragic news that he passed away before reaching England her heart is broken but she moves on with her life. A few years later while adjusting to a new life she meets John Rolfe, (Bale) a plantation owner who allows her to work on his farm and teaches her to read. Meanwhile she gets baptized and her name changed to Rebecca when this man asks for her hand in marriage she accepts and they live happily in his home and a son Thomas is born.During a visit in England She discovers that John Smith has been alive all these years and they see each other again for the last time before returning home she gets pneumonia and dies at the age of 22.

137,kinolieber,There's a longer version coming out on DVD,10,8 January 2006,"I love Terrence Malick's three previous films, and I liked much of ""The New World"" but it felt jumbled somehow to me. As if the editing had been rushed and the film had not quite gelled. Since my faith in the director's talent and integrity is immense, I decided to see it again to try to 'get' whatever I was missing from a first viewing. So I attended a screening today at which producer Sarah Green spoke, and the audience was informed that the version that was released in December for Academy Award consideration, has since been replaced by a version 15 minutes shorter (which was not shown). She assured us we ""wouldn't notice"" the changes. Then we were informed that Malick has already produced a three hour cut he intends to release on DVD. It's a sad state of affairs when one of the world's greatest directors can't release his presumably preferred version of a film to theaters - it has to be relegated to the home video market. In the trailer now being shown on the movie's website there seemed to be scenes and dialog which are not in the version I saw.UPDATE: October 18, 2008 The 172 minute version has been released. I just watched it and as I had hoped, it's a masterpiece.",The New World
138,MagicStarfire,I thought it was rotten eggs - but no - it was this movie!,3,20 June 2006,"3 stars During the film, Pochontas says: ""We are grass."" Whatever the heck that means. I think it meant whoever authored this mess smoked way too much grass while writing it.The film is filled with this kind of babbling, pseudo-poetic nonsense by all the characters - that is - what time they bother to speak to each other at all. Frequently questions are asked by one character to another, but never answered.Pochontas is especially mute. Even after she learns English, Pochontas rarely says more than the occasional word or two, preferring apparently to spend most of her time looking expressionlessly at the ground.By the way, the young actress playing Pochontas had such a fat upper lip I could only conclude she'd had a collagen injection for it. I don't know why she didn't have the bottom lip done, perhaps she ran out of money. Now that she's made this film, maybe she'll have the funds to finish distorting both of her lips.The handsome Irish actor, Colin Farrell plays Capt. John Smith. What time he isn't rambling like a degenerate in need of a brain transplant, he just looks nervous, worried, or scared. Come to think of it - that's the only three expressions I've ever seen Colin portray in any film I've ever seen him in. Fortunately, in ""Phone Booth"" these 3 expressions did him well. In ""The New World"", he could have done with a bit more diversity.Throughout the film, John Smith remains looking as if his hair is greasy and like he needs a thorough scrubbing, even when he isn't in the wilderness, but in England.Now my history books always led me to believe there was never any romance between Pochontas and Capt. John Smith, but bear in mind folks, this is Hollywood, and Hollywood films invariably write history to suit themselves. So, of course, we have to have a romance between John Smith and Pochontas, even though, as we all know, she marries a man named Rolfe.I can't imagine who would find any interest in this draggy film beyond either fans of the actors/actresses in it, or an avid history buff.I had looked forward to seeing this film. It should have been interesting. The way it was done - it was not.",The New World
139,Bungle-9,"Good, although laboured and ponderous",6,16 October 2006,"You have to be really, really in a precise mood to watch this movie and get the most out of it. Malick's style is very prevalent and instantly recognisable to anyone who has watched The Thin Red Line (shots of nature, character narrations), which is a more fulfilling film in my view. The premise is a love story between the famous explorer John Smith and the impudent Pocahontas set against the backdrop of the beginnings of a new nation. The story takes its time and never feels forced, but is quite poorly paced and feels laboured and a bit overwrought. If you want to watch this movie, bear in mind what you're in for - a slow burning romantic drama which is beautifully filmed and masterfully crafted, though it does take a good bit of effort to sit through the whole thing.",The New World
140,eichelbergersports,The world's slowest Indian - movie,3,9 December 2005,"There's certainly no shortage of movies which depict how Europeans came to the Americas, destroyed the land, wiped out the Natives and bespoiled what was a mostly bucolic existence. ""The Mission,"" ""1492,"" ""Last of the Mohicans"" and even the animated Disney film, ""Pocahontas,"" among others, come immediately to mind.The latest effort, from director Terrence Malick (""Days Of Heaven,"" ""Thin Red Line""), ""The New World,"" runs approximately 150 minutes, with 50 percent of the dialogue unspoken between the two leads, Capt. John Smith (Colin Farrell, ""Phonebooth,"" ""Alexander"") and Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher), which proves beyond all doubt that Malick is the master of the unnecessary voice-over.The film starts on an upbeat note as three diminutive English ships sail into a harbor in the Virginia Company territory in 1607. As these boats stream towards shore, the local Indians react with surprise and alarm while James Horner's musical score swells to a tremendous crescendo. A contingent of soldiers arrive led by Capt. Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer, ""The Insider,"" ""Syriana""). The invaders quickly spoil things by killing an Indian, after that they cannot trade for food (or apparently grow their own), so they go through their stores, forcing Newport to return to England for more men and supplies.Before he leaves, though, Newport sends Smith (who was about to be hung) on a mission to a larger village to procure trade goods and food for the long winter. Smith travels with a captured native guide and finally reaches the realm of powerful chief Powhatan (August Schellenerg, ""Iron Will""), where he is beaten and taken prisoner.He is about to be killed, but his life is spared (you know the story) by the youngest child of the chief, known as ""Playful One,"" although her Indian name is never mentioned in the film. Smith then sort of becomes her property/teacher and spends the next six months mentoring her on the ways of the English. This also gives Malick an opportunity to show the two frolicking in the forest forcing their tepid love onto each other over what seems like an epoch.The director also seems to enjoy introducing random shots to the audience. A bird (or flock of them), a tree, a cloud, the water, a chair, an Indian sitting in a chair, Colin Farrell's eyebrows and beard, Q'orianka Kilcher's lips, another bird, a baby turtle (really), wheat, corn, another tree, etc., etc., etc. It looks like the video for R.E.M.'s ""Losing My Religion.""After close to an hour of this unrelenting gallivanting between Smith and Pochahontas, finally something happens when the prisoner is released upon the condition that they leave in the country in the spring. The contrast between Powhatan's village and the run-down colony of Jamestown is vividly presented, as well. The Indians live clean, holy blameless lives while the Englishmen become slowly demented (through prolonged starvation, I suppose), kill each other, drop dead like flies, live in squalor and rant like idiots. One guy blathering directly into the camera like a bad Monty Python character.At one time, Smith claims ""there are only 38 of us,"" in the fort, but then death and disease take their toll, as well as the one battle with the natives, in which seemingly dozens are slaughtered (and only Smith is able to fight), but there seems to be more goofy Brits than ever occupying the colony. Smith is overthrown in a mutiny, Newport arrives with some more homey Englishmen and women, firing his ships cannons and scaring the Indians into submission.Pochahontas comes to live in the colony, giving Smith and her a few more chances to roll around in the woods, but soon he is sent off to England and commissioned by King James to find a northwest passage to the West Indies. He is reported dead and the young Indian maiden is then courted by tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale, ""Batman Begins""). She is baptized, changes her name to Rebecca, reluctantly marries him and immediately has a four-year-old son.Of course Smith is not really dead, but having an affair with a woman in Newfoundland (sigh), and Rolfe and Rebecca are invited to England to meet the king and queen, where she quickly becomes the toast of London. She has a final meeting with Smith, symbolically dumps him and later dies (it's true, she did die in England in real life).With the random shots (especially of Kircher dancing and playing around in the forest), the whole tale seems to take longer than the actual colonization of America, and with half of the speaking parts seemingly done telepathically, there is no real chemistry between the two leads. Pocahontas and Rolfe's love is even less intense, making you wonder what the point of the entire enterprise was.Realistic costumes, sets and decent cinematography do not make up for the wooden acting and stilted script. If you have $10 and two-and-a-half hours to kill, see this picture. If not, just rent ""Last of the Mohicans,"" or ""The Mission,"" learn a little history and enjoy a film-watching experience.",The New World
141,antonjsw1,Hypnotic beauty that draws you in and leads to an emotionally powerful finale,10,25 April 2011,"As much as I view all of Terrence Malick's films as masterpieces, this, the 170+ minute version of this film is my favourite. The story, of the arrival of the first British explorers in what is now Jamestown, Virginia , United States is less a history lesson, more another of study of 3 characters' life journeys within a lavishly realised natural environment. These are explorer John Smith, played very effectively in an understated, restrained and compassionate way by Colin Farrell; Settler John Rolfe, played in a similar fashion by a surprisingly gentle and compassionate Christian Bale; and a stunning performance by first time 15 year old actress Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocohontas. The film is closer in style to Badlands and Days of Heaven, in that it follows a specific story focusing on these characters, with Pocahontas forming the crux of the plot. The first part of the film is the development of a relationship between Smith and Pocohontas, evolving to a more complicated, but ultimately stronger relationship between Rolfe and Pocohontas.Malick again is very flexible with individual scenes, and it is clear that improvisation is still a key aspect of the actors' performances. Malick also was known to mould scenes further in post production and the abstract and minimalist narration seen in Badlands and Days of Heaven is seen again, albeit we hear more characters narrations rather than just the one. The film is closer in structure to first two films than compared to Thin Red Line, which was more a series of vignettes, rather than a story heading towards a clear denouement, as the New World is. However, unlike Badlands or Heaven, this film is more optimistic, and its ending is has a real emotional impact on the viewer. It certainly made me want to see it again, with the ending staying in my head long after the film ended. Like Kubrick, Malick requires the viewer to be patient, and if so they are rewarded with an emotionally involving story between the characters, and a hypnotic creation of atmosphere and environment that draws you in. On Blu-Ray it looks absolutely magnificent.The film is further assisted with excellent supporting performances, notably from veteran Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport, August Schellenberg as Powhatan and Wes Studi (who always seems to crop up in these sort of films – e.g. Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans) as Opechancanough. The chemistry between Farrell and Kilcher in particular is a real strength of the film. How Malick got such a fantastic performance out of her is a real testament to his skill as a director, but kudos has to also go to Farrell's support for the young actress, as well as a clear talent being brought to the surface from Kilcher herself. While her's and Farrell's scenes are intimate, Malick keeps it seemingly innocent but tactfully and tantalisingly leaves some ambiguity as to whether the relationship is more intimate that what you see on the screen. Malick is too much a class act offer anything gratuitous or obvious, and the film is so much better for it.The action sequences, while few and far between (it is not what the film is about), when they happen, like The Thin Red Line they are shot with real style and panache, albeit they do feel slightly sanitised in this film. The film further benefits from some real trenchant technical contributions. The most significant is veteran Mexican photographer Emmanuel Lubeski, who makes the film look absolutely magnificent, no doubt assisted by Malick himself and clever use of Steadicam (by veteran operator Jim McConkey). James Horner, like Zimmer in The Thin Red Line, had to write most of the score before the film had finished being edited. As a result the music plays more like a series of suites. However, this approach seems to work well and the music also adds to the mood and emotions in the film very effectively. Some Wagner (Das Rheingold) added to the score also works very well and creates a very effective mood and feel. The editing, led by Hollywood veteran Richard Chew is clearly in the Malick style (lingering shots of characters, and shots of the environment playing a prominent role in setting up a scene, sudden story time-line jumps) and works very well. Kudos to the production design crew led by (Malick veteran) Jack Fisk, which totally convinces you what time period you are in. Overall this film is a magnificent achievement. A compassionate and emotional involving story beautifully told. Bravo!",The New World
142,alfredsmith,Asks too much of its audience and doesn't entertain.,4,19 August 2006,"Lovers of photography and beautiful images will find much to like in this film as the photography is fantastic. On a big screen it is simply magnificent. But great images on their own do not make a great movie. This film attempts to be too many things at once and fails. The ""arty"" editing really turned me off. There was very little dialogue at the start of the film and I wasn't even sure what was happening. The story and plot (plot? was there a plot?) just jerked along from one scene to the next and made little sense. Colin Farrelll mumbles his way through most scenes and looks like he was acting in a different movie. I believe if there was one more lover's romp in the long grass scene I would have surely thrown up. Throughout the film the characters thoughts were audible but they often didn't relate to what was on the screen at the time.Overall a simple story dragged out to over two hours and filled out with some pretty imagery and very boring dialogue is no way to entertain today's movie audiences. I coudn't recommend this to anyone.",The New World
143,cwarne_uk,Pretty But Very Very Empty,4,13 August 2008,"Terrence Malick is the director who became more and more revered the longer he refrained from making films. What this meant was that when he finally started making films again critics had invested so much in his legend that whatever he turned out would be acclaimed a masterpiece by some. So it turned out as people fell over themselves to praise the not very good ""Thin Red Line"". Some of that effect still lingers with ""The New World"", but noticeably more muted. It's as if people are finally waking up to the truth that Malick's film-making gifts have actually atrophied in his long lay off. ""The New World"" is a not very accurate retelling of the Pocohontas story. It has the usual Malick traits of flat acting, voice-overs and stunning cinematography. Unfortunately the weakness of the film merely shows how limited pretty pictures are in their own right. Some have described this as poetic (always a dodgy term in cinema). If it is it's poetry on the level of a Patience Strong not a Tennysson (let alone a 20th century poet). Malick refuses to challenge his audience as a true artist would (unless you count the challenge of staying awake). If you want to see a masterly updating of Native American stories see Michael Mann's brilliant ""Last Of The Mohicans"". This film is merely for those who want art-film made easy on the palate.",The New World
144,A_Roode,Audiences will be very divided.,8,13 January 2006,"Let me start off by saying that I was introduced to the films of Terrence Malick in 1998 when I watched and was blown away by 'The Thin Red Line.' It is one of the best war movies ever made and while I can rant about it at length, that review belongs on a different page. It was with great anticipation that I waited for 'The New World.' I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening and the theatre was full of people like me. Their take on the film was almost as interesting as the film was.'The New World' is a film that will draw out one of two very powerful emotions: Love or Hate. I really don't believe there is a middle ground in this case. I think it is quite possibly the most beautifully photographed film I have ever seen. It is astonishing. The score from James Horner is, in my opinion, his greatest work. He's a wonderful composer but he has exceeded himself on every level. This is a movie that can be watched like art (because it is) and listened to as a symphony (it might as well be one). Very few movies leave me stunned and 'The New World' is so luscious that I think it is worth the journey, even if it is only to look at how beautiful it is and listen to how glorious it is. Is that a superficial way of looking at things? Perhaps, but they are the film's two most brilliant qualities.'The New World' does have problems and I think it falls very much into a 'buyer beware' category. Malick's movie is long -- very long -- and feels every moment of it. I don't mind these things because I found it enchanting; many in the audience with me did not. These are not people who are 'dumb,' or who 'don't get it.' They are people who are used to 99% of the films that you will see. 'The New World' is very self-indulgent at times. No one can reasonably defend the pace of the film. I want to and I can't. This is a movie so full of substance that it is detrimental. It is so rich and textured that it would be hard to say where things could have been improved, but aside from the first forty minutes which deal largely with the question of whether or not the Europeans can survive the first winter or not, the dramatic 'action,' that is, the engine of a script that pushes one scene into the next, is idling at best. 'The New World' has a plodding pace and it took me on a nice quiet stroll that I enjoyed immensely. I can not, in good conscience though recommend to the man on the street that he go to see it. If less than a third of the theatre I was in walked out, I'd be stunned. I lost count because so many people left. Mostly the middle hour and a half of the film is to blame. Scenes drift from one to the next -- they're stunning and textured and personally I enjoyed them -- but they involved a lot of hanging out. Two people hanging out in the woods. I understand that the film has deep meditative and philosophical meanderings about man's relationship with nature and how one impacts the other. I get it. But a lot of the love story is about two people hanging out in the woods. All the time. If one of them had said 'Let us go watch the grass grow for the afternoon,' it would have been the most honest line in the entire film. It is the only thing I will fault Malick for here because it really does kill the film for a lot of people. His intelligence should not be questioned. I wish only he'd tried to focus the script a bit more and been specific rather than general. Can two people from different cultures be together? We get it already. We got it an hour ago. Oh, more grass growing ... must watch ... ha! Forgive my little joke.The argument to be made though is that this film has not been made for everyone (the studio is no doubt surprised to learn this and will be scrambling to recover their money -- they did a good thing in making it but they're going to lose their shirts). It was made by Terrence Malick for Terrence Malick. I'm glad to have seen it but I spoke with twenty people who were not. There will be constant arguments on the user boards here at the IMDb. The film is going to have rabidly fanatical supporters who think everyone else is just too stupid to get it. And it is going to be criticized by many, many others who died a thousand deaths just trying to sift through the movie.Two final thoughts: the first is that I hate myself for having to say anything negative about Malick or his film. He's a special film-maker and his films make it worth going to the theatre. 'The New World' is great but flawed and it is dishonest for anyone to pretend otherwise -- such behaviour is deceitful and pretentious.Thought number two is that although the film is equal parts challenging and rewarding (as great movies should be) it is especially important in the case of 'The New World' to see it in the theatre. It is so majestic in scope that I don't believe the greatest home theatre can do it justice. It is truly epic in its cinematography and score. If it doesn't win Oscars for both we will have witnessed a massive artistic injustice. NOTHING this year, NOTHING has come close to being a threat to 'The New World' for either of those two categories. Appreciate them as they were intended to be seen.",The New World
145,janos451,Musical Take on 'First Year in Jamestown',7,18 January 2006,"Can the story of Captain Smith, Pocahontas, et.al. be presented in the fashion of ""Last Year in Marienbad""? Terrence Malick (of ""Days of Heaven,"" yup) seems to channel Resnais in ""The New World"" he wrote and directed. It's a bizarre, puzzling, beautiful, and maddening film, sure to end up on both the year's best and worst lists. And, one of the strangest things about this strange movie is its soundtrack. After James Horner's name appears on the screen as the composer, there follows 2 1/2 hours (doesn't anyone make 90-minute movies anymore?) of Mozart and Wagner. Now, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 floating over the muck of the settlement and the broad vistas of the Naturals (as Christopher Plummer refers to the Indians) may be anachronistic, but we are well used to KV 488 from a dozen movies, including - alas - ""Way of the Gun,"" ""Good Riddance,"" and ""Misunderstood."" No, what's interesting about the soundtrack of ""The New World"" is how the Prelude to ""Das Rheingold"" is used - at length and significantly. Just as the film itself is good/bad, there is a contrast here in the appropriateness of the soundtrack. Wagner's unstoppable ascending modulation makes no sense at all in the middle of the movie, but the very beginning is something else. As the settlers' ships approach the coast of this new and strange world, water is everywhere... and there swells that grand ""Creation music"" so well, so right. Underwater glimpses of young native women swimming just reinforce the connection, needlessly. Studio notes, by the way, identify soundtrack portions not written by Horner as ""non-original music."" That be Mozart and Wagner...:)Janos",The New World
146,HiddenVoice,A slow build up.,8,25 December 2005,"This film is slow in many ways.It is more of a meditation on love and loss.Like his previous powerful epic Thin Red Line,Malick likes to slowly build up his story.The slow pace will distract audience but this is a piece of art that is to be enjoyed and Malick deserves to be praised for what he has achieved.Everyone is familiar with the Pocahontas tale,so I won't go into details.Instead I would like to focus on the direction.Unlike Munich this films length becomes pretentious.It doesn't grow on you but frustrates you.But you have to look beyond that to experience the real treasure hidden underneath.Malick has always focused more on the situation and the settings rather than the characters or the actors.It's more like exploring the world than telling a story about it.Slowly and painfully but beautifully.I enjoyed the film even if it was long and boring because I understood what Malick was trying to do.He wants us to feel for the new world that has been discovered and feel for it when it gets destroyed.I cannot say this is his best work but regardless of that it still is a gorgeous film,a wonderful achievement.An artistic drama that slowly builds up to the end.Farrell is not used as an actor but just as a figure who witnesses the sudden ,devastating changes that happen into this new world.The real actor however is the newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher.She excels in the role,she delivers a heartfelt performance and the director has more focus on this famous character rather than the lead hero.Bale also surprises ,who falls for Pocahontas forming a love triangle.The rest of the cast also have its moment.However the praise should entirely go to the Director.He handles every scene like a king.He presents us this new world with aching beauty and gorgeous sets.He makes the love story between the two leads even more emotional.His slowly building up of story is where audience will lose the film.They will rather find it irritating but if you look closer there's a lot going for it.On the whole THE NEW WORLD is gorgeous epic,a sort of a mess,a heartwarming emotional love story,and a heart stopping epic with not so many noteworthy performances or moments.But a meditated attempt.A film that tries to connect with the audience the hard and painful way ,in which,the reward is priceless.****/5",The New World

Here, the story is a true story (I don't know - and don't care - how much it is accurate to the original story), and the script tells it to us in a quite ""arty"" way : while being told about the fort's discipline, John Smith thinks about Pocahontas (so we here about the fort and watch the girl running in the bushes). Lots of ""off voice"", with a quite tired tone, it is poetic, poetic and boring like hell. I had to end watching the DVD using the fast-forward button : I couldn't stand any more.

Much has been made of the voice-over style used rather than actual dialogue between the characters. This is a key problem because you have to actually hear it and want to know what they are saying and truth is I couldn't hear half of due to the unusually bad sound quality.Captain Smith had 1 expression (pretty much) all tilted eywbrows and ""why am I in this movie?"" kind of look. In fact most of the characters looks somewhat bemused and probably surprised they could get paid for being in such an incoherent film.Perhaps the sound/ music department also got bored with the film and walked out?

Its difficult to think what the director thought would impress us during this hour? The predictable conclusion? The simple lack of plot and blatant mid-film re-use of the previous love stories scenes and emotions?

153,dorotka24,For film aficionados only,3,6 November 2007,"I sat through ""Thin Red Line"" and couldn't wait to get out of the theater and get on with my day. In fact, it is one of the few films I've seen in which I had a nearly irresistible urge to walk out on. I saw ""New World"" at Family Video in the 2 for $1 section, and being a lover of historical drama, wanted to give it a shot. I failed to notice, however, that it was directed by Terrence Malick, which is unfortunate since it would have remained on the shelf had I realized.The film is, like Thin Red Line, high art and light substance. It is dreamy, trippy, and filled to overflowing with the internal monologue of the main character. Now that's not in itself a bad situation. However, when the character has almost nothing poignant or interesting to comment on and his delivery is a droning monotone, then the film rapidly becomes a bore.But that, in my opinion is not even the biggest flaw in the movie. The thing that baffles me is why Malick would choose as a backdrop such moments in history as World War II and the English colonization of North America. I suppose that's the point - taking existentialism quite deliberately in contrasting the internal solitude of one man with the terrifying realism of his external environment in very trying times. Still, it seems the same point could have been made in his own home with no name actors instead of in a different time period with A list actors and all the costumes, props, and other challenges involved.I always try to look for some good even in movies I dislike. I can say that the scenery was very beautiful and the time period otherwise seemed well represented with seemingly authentic costumes for both natives and colonists alike. And it did make me think a bit to compile this review. I've read many of the glowing reviews and can appreciate some of the points made.But in the end, I was so bored and otherwise unstimulated that I couldn't finish the movie.

I had few hours to pass and some critics gave the movie rave reviews. I'm glad I like all kinds of movies and not just adventure and action movies because The New World is more a historical romantic drama. The movie shows the beauty of unspoiled nature of America, the Indians living there and how the settlers affect Pocahontas and her life. Pocahontas is an innocent child of the nature and beautiful in mind, soul and body. The first American John Smith falls for her for obvious reasons. The love between Pocahontas and Smith isn't shown through words but thoughts. To me that gave much depth to the affair and the characters. The movies soundtrack is also wonderful really setting the mood. Besides about the beauty of the untouched America, clash of the cultures and the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas the movie is about the insanity of man. The settlers were lead with someone having a medal in his neck and so being the leader seemed like children playing to me. Most actors do a great job including Christian Bale one of my favorite actors at the last half of the movie. I didn't know how the story of Pocahontas and John Smith went before the movie so it was exciting to see how it developed. In the end when I left the theater the movie left me moved.

Viewing such excellence makes me proud to be an American.As evocative and yearning as the greatest poems, as sane as the most profound meditation, and as deep as the most sumptuous dream, ""The New World"" is an achingly beautiful film. It is the most sensual ""no-nudity"" film you will ever see. The eroticism here reveres life and reaches out lyrically and sacredly to all creation.Christian Bale and Colin Farrell are powerfully present on-screen and give two of the best understated performances I've ever seen.God has blessed Q'Orianka Kilcher with great beauty and talent; her smile could warm ice to melt in Antarctica, and she is freshly sensual in an unspoiled way as only a young woman can be. Kilcher is excellent at quietly portraying the nearly impossible journey Pocahontas traveled socially, emotionally and spiritually. That she navigated through the great joys and sorrows of her short life is a testament to her strength and humanity.The cinematography is beautiful - with its natural setting, vivid colors and diffused lighting making objects and people almost palpable.When I say this movie is probably the finest ever made in the U.S.A., I do not mean to imply in any way that it resembles the glut of sausage mill product being extruded out of Hollywood. There are no silly car chases, no phony battles between purely good and purely evil characters, and no bankrupt moralizing which panders to a fawning, lazy audience. Thank God!A supreme achievement, ""The New World"" is the cinematic equivalent of swans drifting slowly on a lake as the fairest summer day of the year closes.As soon as it became available on blu-ray, I purchased it, because I wanted something this transcendent to have a place in my home.Thank you, Mr. Malick, for this peerless work of art!",The New World

This film is a pretentious waste of anybody's time. The acting is so bad that it is funny at times - as are the numerous mistakes. The one I liked particularly is a shot of a child eating an enormous bright yellow mielie, as produced by top agribusiness today as if that's what they had back then. The English court scene would have been an embarrassment if acted in a junior school play.The acting, if you can call it that, is of the standard that South African films used to have - all the characters are wooden, nearly all the time. The extras look like very uncomfortable extras in unfamiliar clothes. The plot, such as it is, based on historical events, unwinds with painful and obvious slowness - but still has huge gaps in it.The achingly obvious message the film ponderously tries to hammer home is, I suppose, thought by the producer to be subtle.Oh, dear, what an amazing crock of shite - avoid at all possible costs.

162,galahad58,Malick or no-Malick?,1,22 January 2006,"Are you the type of person who would be interested in a Terrance Malick film? That is the foremost question you should ask yourself before going to the theater and spending box office prices. Do NOT think about the fact that Colin Farrell or Christian Bale are in this film before you spend your hard earned money. I would suggest you rent one of Malick's previous films. If you can sit through one of his movies, then you may have a taste for what he puts upon the screen. If you cannot sit through his films, then you have saved yourself a lot of money. Malick is for those who want to sit at a art exhibit and stare at a red dot like the dot was an original piece of art. Malick's work is for those who patrol art exhibitions by artists who make things out of garbage so they can ""fit in"" with high society. Malick is popular with the Hollywood liberals--that should explain enough right there. It is him personality that makes him popular over his talent. Malick is NOT a good film maker. His audiences are small because his talent is limited. Malick spends more time trying to convey messages with LONG shots of grass, trees, birds, bushes, etc because his dialog cannot bring out the essence of the film itself. Malick cannot bring the better performances out of his actors that would create the same atmosphere (but better) that he tries to create with his terrific direction. Malick is not in the same league with the great directors of our time: William Wyler, Steven Spielburg, Clint Eastwood, etc. Men who can focus on an actor's eyes for the perfect emotion, men who can tell a story without focusing on a blade of grass, and men who can make three hour movies and maintain a proper flow of visuals and dialog. Rent The Thin Red Line, Heaven's Gate, or Badlands (all in the worse 100 movies of all time) and if you can sit through any of them; you are ready for Malick.",The New World
163,tallard,Same level of sensitivity as a Jean-Claude Van Damme,1,21 January 2006,"This film was not my worst ever, but nearly. Historical dramas are I could say my favorite genre. I grew up in a very small town right next to a ""native reserve"" from which I counted a couple of my best friends. I've always had empathy for the Americas original inhabitants and am always interested in how they are portrayed in movies (which is usually disappointing, but I keep trying) so this was my frame of mind when I paid for this movie at Regal Cinemas. Within approximately 45 minutes, my disappointment had already started.I think most nature lovers agree, when the sun's rays shine through leaves, it is a beautiful sight, and running through tall grasses can certainly have an appeal, but in this movie, these 2 images fill nearly a third of screen time. Followed closely by images of the 2 non-lovers staring into each others eyes or His hands groping at Her (she's a child!!!) By the middle of the movie, the endless slow motion clips of the sun's rays and swaying grasses were reminding me of a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. That's exactly his gimmick: take a severely lacking script and dress it up with endless slow motion shots of sunsets and nature. Don't get me wrong I am a sucker for cinematographic portrayals of nature, but one can't repeat the same shot over and over and over again. Take March of the Penguins, nature shooting at it's finest.An hour and a half into this film, I can't even use the word movie anymore, I'm thinking, when is the story going to begin! I have learned absolutely nothing about this period in history, people's thoughts. All we know is the ""naturals"" are flip-flopping between bringing gifts or warring with the colonialists, and Pocahontas's narration can probably fit into one page with large print. She repeats the same things over and over again, which only served to make the Indians seem really lacking in intelligence. Actually, that is also a sentiment that came over me, this movie completely lacks respect for Native American culture. It unfortunately made them seem like simple minded grunting beasts. Outrageous.I never walk out of a movie. Movies are my favorite pass-time and I will sit through most anything. However I do sometimes fall asleep (maybe 8 times in total, out of 4 shows a week for a quarter century) and I didn't in this one, but many other patrons did fall asleep.And then oh surprise, Christian Bale came on screen (I didn't know he was in this), and I thought ""finally, maybe we'll get some resolution"" but no, nothing new (nor in the story nor in the acting) came of his presence. In my opinion, Christian and Collin both have strong acting skills, but they absolutely require strong direction because otherwise they both come off as very wooden.By the end, I was so disappointed. Mind you, my expectations were not that high, as I've only ever liked 2 each of Collin's and Christian's movies (The recruit, At home at the end of the world, The mechanic, Batman begins). But when I have low expectations, usually a movie will leave me not completely dissatisfied. Not the case here, this movie will not go down in history as anything. It will be forgotten and the story of Pocahontas remains untold.",The New World
164,abcizdaman,Meh..,6,1 February 2020,"Very vivid scenes and great costumes. Other than that.. the story was very long and drawn out. A lot of the time people didn't talk, they just thought. Either that or just some long drawn out scenes with a long music score. The music was nice but went on too long when people could be acting. Sometimes I didn't know whether people were thinking or talking to each other. Good thing I was streaming it, because I had to rewind a lot to figure out what was being said. You have this 5 minute scene of people just standing, looking, or doing something else with no talking/thinking and then all of a sudden things are said and I have to rewind. I used closed caption which was perfect for this one, because otherwise I'd probably be lost. It could've been a great movie. I can understand why I've never heard of this one before. Several well known actors in it too. A lot less silence and people staring at each other and I would've really enjoyed it.",The New World

This helps the movie because an important part of the movie involves the misunderstanding between English and Indian languages.It's a wonderful love story. It answers the question all young girls have when they first hear that story from their 3rd grade teacher: ""Why did Pocahontas save John Smith's life, and why did she marry someone else instead of him?"" The major parts were played very well. The voice-over narrative was a little too similar to Thin Red Line's...""Who are you. Who am I?"" That kind of stuff.

All the performances are excellent, the cinematography is astounding, and although it may seem a bit slow at times, its perfect. Yes, there probably was some historical inaccuracies.

About 17 months after I'd heard of the movie, I finally saw it on DVD.TNW has a very interesting premise: a new take on the classic Phocahonatas story. It had a lot of potential going into it. But watching the movie, it is as if Terrence Mallik fired all of his crew except for the cinematographer. Every shot is like a painting, landscapes of fields and other places. Even scenes with people look like they've been painted. Because of just landscape, the movie feels so empty. No characters are developed, the plot seems weak, and I found myself counting the minutes until it would be over. I was bored out of my mind.This movie is for the kind of people who can go into an art gallery and sit at one painting for an hour, move to another for another hour, and continue like that. Mallik should have just made a collection of paintings and called them ""The New World.""Despite having an all-star cast, a promising newcomer, and a story I've always enjoyed hearing, this movie was easily the biggest let-down of the year.",The New World

The animated version of the Pochahontas is of course childish, but this tale of Pochahontas sheds light on what really transpired when the first settlers came to Virginia. It reveals the terrible hardships of the first settlers who came to Virginia, and how they failed to realize the beauty of the land that the Native Americans knew so well.But what really moved me is the wonderful, selfless love that Roth gives Pochahontas and how he mends her heart after Smith's restless soul crushes it. The different levels of love portrayed in the movie are rich, beautiful and realistic; all shown with the amazing backdrop of a still wild America.",The New World
169,arkif1,A short while for history,10,30 January 2020,"The New World is my favourite film of Terrence Malick's. I liked the Thin Red Line alot, because it depicted war as war should be depicted and was, to the best of my knowledge, first depicted by Ernst Jünger in In Stahlgewittern (1920). But here we have a film that isn't just depicting a moment in time, but the eventual joining of two lines of human evolution after a seperation of more than 10000 years.While watching The New World cannot be accepted as an equivalent substitute for having actually been around all over this planet for the last 10000 years, it does open the mental pathways that allow a man to ponder the question what man has been doing all of this time.Very few films do that. Very few films give you a chance to reflect and compare. Not everything in The New World is quite believable, but there is enough texture, enough undeniable detail, that a realistic appraisal of the value of civilization is triggered.And although the film does take a side, it doesn't do so in a way that would prevent you from contemplating the virtue of the other side.While watching the Making Of I was amazed about how much more engaging Christian Bale is in real life than on film. I think he's muting himself too much. You can also do it too little (e.g. Tom Selleck), but I think he's doing it too much.Plummer plays adequately. Farrell looks sad as always, makes me wonder why anybody wanted him to play Alexander or Crockett. Here it fits better, but he still got on my nerves.Aynway, all the actors could do is to sink this film and they didn't. It is not a film that hinges on stellar performances like Le Dîner de cons, for instance. No, the achievement here lies in the appearance of actuality, in doing away with the idea that you live in the 21st century and looking at a set or some plot of land set aside for scenic beauty next to a motorway. The achievement also lies in the sense of curiosity the film instills and that comes from not knowing why the director is showing you what he's showing you, i.e. that the plot of the film is not some transparent construct to make some specific point, but rather like a list of highlights on a sightseeing tour, which includes the necessary stops.",The New World
170,kcfl-1,I owe Malick $8,9,19 November 2012,"I thought of Malick as an visual director from the 1970s, who was away from film-making too long and disappointed with his 1998 ""Thin Red Line."" Typical Malick film: gorgeous, but weak story. Thus, I didn't see ""The New World"" when it came out in 2005. But I did see ""Tree of Life"" in theatrical release, and judged it the best film of last year. So when ""New World"" was available On Demand, I caught it, and felt guilty that I hadn't forked over my 8 bucks 7 years ago. Malick has transcended story. Beauty for its own sake works here as it did with ""Tree."" There are scenes, impressions, but no coherent script, and it doesn't matter. It's an experience, with music, acting and the cinematography, always the cinematography, combining for a wonderful experience.",The New World

The cinematography is simply gorgeous, the vivid colours and the perfectly captured natural landscape help to enhance the dream-like vision that this movie sets out to create. The performances are restrained but extremely natural, conveying a genuine picture of a passionate romantic relationship which struggles to survive in an era of discovery and transition. The musical score is captivating and scintillating and wonderfully compliments the beauty of the film. And the direction is that of a master indisputably at the top of his game.In short this is a film where everything came together, a perfect cinematic feast and a genuinely emotionally engaging movie. Fans of Malick in particular and the motion picture art form in general will walk away from this in absolute awe and appreciation. A shimmering masterpiece.",The New World
172,awalter1,the strange & wonderful art of Terrance Malick,10,25 January 2006,"Great, sweeping, lyrical shots of the natural world. A passionate but respectful infatuation between the camera's eye and the lovely face of a young beauty we've never seen before. Ever-climbing, harmonious waves of symphonic delicacy. And a powerful, labyrinthine mood built of images that court the eye rather than assail it. These are just a few of the pleasures offered by ""The New World."" Something to realize, right from the start, about Terrance Malick's new film is that he's telling his story on an abstracted plane and by way of the mythological mode. If just hearing that gives you a headache, then maybe this isn't the movie for you. Otherwise, you're in for a real treat.Okay, okay... So maybe Pocahontas was a mere ten years old when she saw her first white people and only twelve when John Smith left her and the Jamestown settlement in 1609. Maybe there was no enigmatic, and potentially romantic, relationship between the two. But this is all beside the point. Malick is not interested--and we can be ever so thankful for this--in telling a polemically-oriented story. He's not interested in giving us a dry, by-the-numbers, cinematic regurgitation of fact, or in constructing some historical-revisionist fantasy.It should be obvious, for anyone paying attention to Malick's unusual filming style here, that this Pocahontas (played by the 14-year-old Q'Orianka Kilcher) is the archetype that has grown out of her legend. Here she is woman-as-land, a rather obvious but effective metaphor. Malick builds onto the metaphor two love stories, each taking as its object this blend of woman and land. The first romance (with explorer John Smith--Colin Farrell) is one of innocence, at least on the part of Pocahontas. The second (with farmer John Rolfe--Christian Bale), by far the more difficult relationship, is a romance of experience. These romances, of course, are what make great myth and great cinema. And like all great legends, this one presents a larger-than-life story yet leaves us to draw our own conclusions from it. But that's art for you--something with which most movies shouldn't be confused.And how refreshing it is to see a film built from elliptical, intuitive patterns of imagery and soliloquy rather than from a dogged plot or ideologically-motivated pandering. The New World--like Martin Scorsese's ""Kundun"" or Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""--is that rare thing, a dream you can sink into, a place to momentarily lose yourself in visual and aural poetry.",The New World

Colin Farrel is trying to follow in the James Dean mold; sullen rebel without a discrenable cause. He looks around, he sulks, he looks, he glances at the ground, he stares, and does more staring, he whispers and then looks into the sunset.This goes on for the whole movie.The director was obviously a fan of Fitzcaraldo, that idiot German director of those soulful incomprehensible boring movies about troubled men and their troubled lives...who cares?",The New World
175,jdoan-4,The best at what he does,8,27 May 2006,"Terrence Malick is one of those directors that has created a genre of film-making, and he is best at it. Many indie filmmakers today attempt to imitate his style, but are unsuccessful (I am thinking in particular of David Gordon Green and ""Undertow"", a film produced by Malick). He is a master of visual poetry. Nearly every person that liked this film mentions the astonishing visuals, and they are perfectly justified. This film is lovely. I don't think that each scene is as tightly constructed as in a Hitchcock film. For Malick the Gestalt is more important that the individual scene. This film is very impressionistic. I cannot note any specific scene that stood out to me. The compilation of scenes is what gives the film substance. Malick is a very naturalistic filmmaker. He is more interested in how his characters interact with nature and how nature interacts with the characters. The narrative is not the main objective, that is why the narrative is highly corrugated. One of the aspects of the film I liked the best was the voice over narration. That is something that has stuck me about all of his films. It is not tightly connected to the narrative. It is on another level, and yet it has everything to do with the narrative. Sometimes it seems superfluous and pretentious, but most of the time it is very provocative. You have to think about it since it is perpendicular to the narrative. This is not Malick's best film. That honor goes to ""Badlands"", his first. But this film is very good.",The New World
176,Zettelhead,"Heavyweight Kitsch, Cliché, Mumbling and Boredom",3,4 April 2016,"This film started with some whispered voice-over, continued with mumbled voice-over and never stopped with mumbling and whispering... There where some beautiful shots of landscape. And for sure Q'orianka Kilcher is totally sweet, but all this is drowned in mumbling, whispering and waggonloads of chliché.You have to listen to sentences like ""Who is she?"" or ""Who is he?"" about 12.000 times because the actors are not speaking but continuously thinking trite bullshit.The native Americans are called (very p.c.!) naturals, not savages, like the first settlers probably would have done, and they are depicted as real childlike and naive ""noble savages"".Pocahontas is so deeply natural, constantly talking to her mother (nature!), so completely in balance with her environment that you get sick of it. And she is so holy and pure that she purifies the soul of every men falling in love with her.And civilization is completely evil and destructive. John Smith is turned into a martyr because he realizes that he is responsible for the corruption of the pure and innocent soul of America, instead of realizing that he just behaves like a stupid asshole. But the script turns his letting-her-down into a saving-her-from-evil. Yak! The music is terrible. It does not fit the time, the scenes or whatsoever.There are dozens of highly illogical scenes that just do break the continuity. Once Pocahontas is at the coast, than she is hundreds of miles upstream, in one scene the settlers and Indians are killing each other, in the next they are just staring at each other with no visible victims of the former battle, in one scene the Indians take Georgetown, burn it to the ground and kill the inhabitants, in den next the Indians are again outside the palisades, the people of Georgetown are still alive and are on the watch and so on...And when Smith finally returns to England and visits Pocahontas, now called Rebecca, he still is dressed like coming straight out of the wilderness with greasy, filthy hair and ragged leather clothe...Why 3 stars instead of 1?

I was greatly looking forward to this although I thought I knew pretty much what to expect for better and worse (particularly after the Thin Red Line) and so it proved to be. Stunning photography, good acting, a decent story told at a (very) leisurely pace and long shots of flora and fauna with birds squawking. These comments may seem a little cynical but this is what you get. Good points: Fabulous photography. The arrival of the English settlers to this New World is very well portrayed and the reaction of the locals to these aliens and visa versa convincing and plausible. The appearance and customs of the Indians  opps! - Native Americans is convincing (to me at least) and wonderfully strange. The experiences and adventures undertaken by the central character of Pocahontas is sensitively and movingly portrayed  the acting of Q'Orianka Kilcher was very impressive. Her turn to experience a 'New World' also comes in due course, when she travels to England and meets the King and Queen. Again, her wonder of the strangeness of this environment is convincing and moving. The recreation of 17th century Merrie Olde England is well done although oddly brief, particularly given the pace of the story up to this point. Bad points: Well, I like beautiful pictures as much as the next man and make no mistake, this is a beautiful film to watch but I did get restless seeing shots of a bird flying over a river for the umpteenth time. The voices-over as the characters wrestle with their inner demons I found a little tedious also. Yes, I know Malick teaches philosophy but I'm not convinced that this technique adds much to our knowledge of the motivation of the characters and often sounds pretentious. The fact is that the first two-thirds or thereabouts of the movie is too long and would have benefited from having 30 minutes snipped off. As previously stated, the trip to England and the consequent climatic events move at almost too brisk a pace (maybe relating to budget  I assume very expensive to create crowd scenes in a convincing 17th century environment?). The movie then ends rather suddenly. One aspect which is fascinating and I suspect may not be appreciated by all viewers is that the story is true. The essentials concerning the story of Pocahontas, Captain Smith and John Rolfe are largely accurate as best as can be judged from the detailed documented accounts from the period, including the presentation of the 'Indian Princess' to King James and Queen Anne. I greatly admire Malicks work  he paints a large and ambitious canvas. The artistic and cinematic quality of The New World is beyond dispute and it is in literally a different league from most of the trash that passes for cinema currently. Terrence just needs some decent scissors and an editor that can argue the case for steady and consistent pacing and plot development. And maybe a few less squawking birds next time..",The New World

I know several names and important dates in regaurds to John Smith, the pilgrims, and the founding of British colonies in the United States, and I still rarely had any idea what the hell was going on most of the time. For one thing, they never use names for any of the characters. Also, the characters have realistically thick accents, which is good for reasons of authenticity, but I could understand nearlly half of the dialouge.

179,zaremskya-23761,A beautiful clash of civilizations,9,5 January 2017,"The saga of European colonization of the Americas is epic and dramatic in and of itself. The New World, by acclaimed auteur Terrence Malick tells the story of the English arrival at Virginia and the conflict between John Smith and his men and the native people led by Powhatan.There is definitely a spiritual air to the work as with most of Malick's films, and the point of view seems to be from the position of the natives, as the cinematography is very awe-inspiring and dazzling giving the experience of seeing something new to the viewer.The fierce violence and seriousness of the interactions between the English and natives is interspersed with touching romance between John Smith and the princess Pocahontas. Malick's romantic side shines brightly and the lovers story takes off swiftly.The identity of the characters is a key theme in the film, and with John Smith's capture by the natives and Pocahontas' conversion to Christianity, identities fluctuate to and fro with the underlying humanity of the characters providing a solid groundwork.The film is excellent, and beautiful artistic interpretation of the events of the colonization of Early America.

It looked absolutely beautiful and had some of the best cinematography that I have seen.But here's the true problem with the story. It had no real continuity and reminded me too much of the cheap independent films I've seen at film festivals. I could never identify with any of the characters and never felt much sympathy for any of them accept Pocahontas. This movie seemed more like a stage play than an actual movie. The actors didn't really seem convincing in their roles. The natives seemed more like Puerto Ricans than natives. It's like the makers of this movie have no idea of the concept of plot structure.My girlfriend passed out from boredom while watching this movie, and I almost joined her.

181,cineasten89,"A beautiful movie giving form to the story of Pocahontas, John Smith and John Rolfe",7,13 June 2006,"First of all, this is not a movie based entirely on fact and truth. There are many inventions and many events that are not entirely chronological correct. I grew up adoring Pocahontas, and when I was almost six years old I watched the Disney version of the movie. Three years later, I watched the movie ""Pocahontas: The Legend"" which was disappointing but yet didn't stop my fascination for the story of Pocahontas. In 2000, when I was going to be eleven years old, I saw the famous painting of the engagement between Pocahontas and John Rolfe in the Capitol Hill, Washington D.C.This movie shouldn't be seen solely for historical truth; but rather solely for entertainment and its beauty. It's a fascinating and great story, yes, but the legend of Pocahontas varies depending on where the source came from. Also, most of the stories of Pocahontas has been invented, or romanticized to make it more interesting. Yet, the only facts that I can determine are true is that Pocahontas was a real person as well as John Smith and John Rolfe. But whether they actually were in love with her, and if she actually loved them we never can know. But what's true is that Pocahontas eventually married John Rolfe.Other than that, this movie can almost be called an art. The photography is so beautiful, and tends to stay at a point of scene a bit longer than most movies usually do, which give the movie a real, calm and thoughtful feeling. Unfortunately, it also leaves a lot of empty gaps in the movie, which makes the 2 hours and 15 minutes story feel a bit too long. Anyways, you feel as if you could identify with what the characters of the movie felt. This movie is so totally different the earlier versions, including the Disney movie.Like all the legends of Pocahontas, this movie starts with the Englishmen shipping ashore to the Virginia coast in 1607, and meets the naturals who first act very friendly and curiously. But what happens thereafter is too uncertain, and too loose based on too many theories and speculations. So, let's say the rest of movie is based on a lot of theories, a lot of mythological stories we've learned about Pocahontas and a lot of fiction, too, to make it more interesting.",The New World

He is a visual artist, and a poet, but these skills do not compliment each other in ""The New World"", a pretentious, disjointed mess. Remember the awkward scene in the first ""Superman"" film where we hear Lois Lane's thoughts in a cheesy pseudo-poetic voice-over? Now imagine if that scene were tow and a half hours long.

183,colinbarnard-1,A Bit of a Muddle,6,22 January 2006,"I went into this film with high hopes. I was deeply impressed with the visual poetry of ""The Thin Red Line"". I had looked forward to Mr. Malik's latest outing. Oooops! ""The New World"" is a well-intentioned mess that I don't think is entirely Mr. Malik's fault.Apparently, the limited-release version screened before Christmas had to be hustled back to the editing room prior to Christmas for a little ""fine tuning"". Hmmmmm....the wide release date was supposed to be before Christmas. Awards qualifications, and all that. But, the ""improved"" version is relegated to the cinematic January graveyard. I guess it's now in the theatres just to advertise the DVD release, which, I'll wager, will be sometime in February or March! Many other reviewers of this film have commented on ""The New World""'s pace. Whether it is ""slow moving"" or ""fast paced"". Neither concept is necessarily pejoritive: ""2001"" is ""slow moving"", and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is ""fast paced"". Both are classics. ""Heaven's Gate"" is slow moving and ""Pearl Harbour"" is ""fast paced"". Both are bombs! Exactly what happens between opening and closing credits determines the quality of the film.With ""The New World"", nothing much happens between the credits, and what does, we don't care about. I do want to see the ""longer"" version, though, because I suspect that more character development occurred. At least, I hope so.Rumour has it that Mr. Malik had his priciple actors improvise many of their scenes. This works for the 14 year old Q'orianka Kilcher, who had a career as a mime artist prior to her debut in this film. She is the centre of the film, the metaphor for everything that occurs around her. Colin Farrell, Christian Bale are not mime actors. Forced to tell their story (and develop their characters) by facial expressions, and vignette editing leaves the audience with a profound inability to empathize with the characters or the story. Except for, maybe, Q'uorianka.As I said, Kilcher is the centre of the story. However, she too is hobbled by the vignettes that seek to stitch her life together from first contact to her final fate in England, but these events have very little narrative follow through, hence the use of voice-overs, and pretentious poetry. It worked in ""Thin Red Line""; it does not here. It's just a little too obscure.Apparently, Q'uorianka's more steamy scenes with Mr. Farrell were cut due to her age (14 at time of filming). While the ""Rebecca"" character's story is told over what appears to be several years, every shot of Q'uorianka reminds the viewer that we are watching is still a child. A very talented one, though. As historically accurate as casting a young woman of this age may have been, if the film-makers (New Line, are you listening?) can't let an actress explore and portray all aspects of the character's reality, why cast a girl this young in the first place? What's left is rather sterile, though I'm sure it won't offend the anti-pedophile set! Couldn't you have found a somewhat older actress who could pull off the younger ""Rebecca"" and then age with the character without offending modern-day sensibilities? I make these comments not because I am not impressed with what is left of Q'uorianka on the screen, because I am. I gripe and groan because it is obvious that this film will quite quickly sink into oblivion in a few weeks. If you are going to make a film that nobody will see, what's the point? A little less muddling would have created a film that pays homage to the cultures of Native Americans (which we don't see enough of) in an accessible mainstream way. Not this time, Terry.",The New World
184,eapplebaum,Spectacular Poetic film,10,18 February 2013,"I can not understand and other rating but a 10 for this film. Why? Because it didn't contain a lot of unnecessary drivel, extraneous blabber and gratuitous violence and sex? This film made me weep from the poetic and graceful depiction of the worst and best of human nature. The visual narration evokes deep emotion. Few film makers and actors can achieve such a sensory blast with music, visual, poetry and acting with little dialogue. I commend Sir Malik and the great actors who were able to transform themselves so eloquently to tell a story so moving and profound in a world where a story like this is usually told in everything this film was not. It was sensitive and touching and artistic. Something we seem to be losing.",The New World

Terrence Malick is one of my heroes but I had the feeling that, this time, he was expecting too much from me. Within the lushness of the surroundings there is something static, unapproachable, inaccessible. Q'Orianks Kilcher as Pocahontas is, quite simply, sublime but her emotions, and therefore mine, were kept so far removed that it was hard for me to get involved. Slowly, very slowly but surely her story started to creep in under my skin. I floated out of the theatre transported by the visual feast I had been served but frustrated by the numbness it provoked. A Terrence Malick film is a Terrence Malik film and you take it the way it was intended. I will, but I fear I'll be in the minority.",The New World

""Oh wow, look at great camera angle and that evokes just the right- Wait, it's gone.""The good: The story, as a whole, has the potential to be powerful, moving, and evocative. The bad: The long winded style of film-making drags out an hour and forty five minute story to two and a half hours.The good: What little lines are spoken are thoughtful and poetic. The bad: Virtually all of the lines spoken are voice overs to show what the character is thinking and it gets old after a while.When I walked into the room and saw that this was on, I was intrigued at first, mesmerized by the subtle performances and how John Smith and Pochahontas were delicately interacting with each other....then it just kept going....and going....With huge chunks of time passing in a single moment but with no indication so by the time you've figured out what's going on something else has happened or some character has realized something vitally important.A+ for effort, D for actual quality.",The New World
188,rumbleinthejungle,Enjoyed the 'making of' doco. more than the film itself!,5,26 February 2009,"The latest film by the enigmatic director Terence Malick (The Thin Red Line, Badlands) divided critics and audiences with some declaring it a self-indulgent, plot-less load of twaddle and others labeling it a masterpiece of poetic cinema. The story concerns the early encounters of English explorers with the Native American peoples in Virginia 1607, focusing specifically on the relationship between the adventurer John Smith and Pocahontas The film clocks in at just over three hours and there are large sections that are bereft of dialog but we do get the thoughtful, pondering voice-over of Smith as his relationship with the innocent Pocahontas takes shape. Visually, the film is incredible to behold and I probably enjoyed the 'making of' documentary more than the film itself; the director of photography and production crew all elaborating on the painstaking way they recreated the magnificent sets and costumes. Malick himself is absent from the entire documentary, but do we gain certain insights into his filming technique, such as his preference to shoot the entire film in natural light.",The New World

Sex-slave documentaries that wrench your heart, war movies, concentration camps etc. Never had a problem watching a film to the end.

More than once I thought this film was intended for the 'TV movie of the Week' because of pauses that seemed to have no purpose. Supposedly this movie is about Pocahontas, but if you expect a script like the Disney version, you will be sorely mistaken.Not that I blame the writers/orchestra/actors/others for any of this.

191,Crystal_Hansen,WHAT A SORRY WASTE OF MY TIME!!!!!!,1,31 August 2018,"The only reason I watched this movie was because it was for a class. I never would've watched it otherwise and I'll probably never watch it again.
The movie is supposed to be about Captain John Smith meeting Pocahontas in the new world. The movie starts out with a few of the Natural women swimming wearing nothing. John Smith is a prisoner on the boat, I think. I'm not quite sure. When the boat gets to the shore John Smith is released from his chains and sent to go explore the island. The boat then leaves again to go back to England to get supplies. During the exploration of the island John Smith and the people that were exploring with him are attacked by the Naturals and John is taken prisoner. The others are killed, I think. On the day of his execution, Pocahontas puts her head on him and saves his life. He lives among them for a while and promises the chief that the white settlers will leave in the spring. John doesn't know that the settlers intend to stay. While he's with the Naturals, he and Pocahontas get very close. Then he goes back to Jamestown and is met by utter chaos. The leader guy yells at John Smith for staying with the Naturals for so long, because they're starving and he was well fed. Then Pocahontas comes along to bring them food and John Smith, for lack of a better term, breaks up with Pocahontas. She appears to be completely crushed and leaves looking very depressed. As she leaves the settlers bow down to her. She just saved all their lives. As time goes on, the Naturals and the settlers start fighting. At some point John Smith had been elected as the settlement's new leader. During the fighting his leadership is taken from him and he's treated as an outcast. When Pocahontas' father, who happens to be the chief, finds out about her relationship with John Smith and what she did with the food, he disowns her and tries to sell her. The people in Jamestown are all for it but John Smith refuses to let them buy her. They do anyway and Pocahontas is taught how to behave like a white person. The boat comes back with supplies and John Smith is sent away on an expedition. He tells someone to tell Pocahontas that he's dead after he's been away for two months. She's told, has major depression, then meets and marries John Rolfe. She has a kid. They go to England to meet with the King and Queen. Before the go back to Jamestown, Pocahontas gets sick and dies. The movie ends with scenes of a river and a shot of the forest that lasts forever.
I think the editor was having a heart attack and wanted to make sure the movie was all edited before he died. It was so hard to follow. The editing was lousy and made the movie near impossible to understand. I'd much rather watch the Disney version.
I did a little research about when Pocahontas saved John Smith's life. According to the records John Smith made of the event that actually happened. But historians question the accuracy of the account because it was written well after it actually happened and Pocahontas was like ten at the time. John Smith made it seem like she was fourteen or fifteen. There wasn't actually any romance between John Smith and Pocahontas. Thanks a lot Disney. 
The Disney movie makes a lot more sense, even if it has no historical accuracy whatsoever. The story is a lot easier to follow and doesn't cut off the scenes in weird places. It's a lot more smooth flowing.
I liked the scenery. And the music. I thought it was funny how often Pocahontas was in a tree.
I hated most of the movie. My biggest problem was how depressed they made Pocahontas after she was told that John Smith was dead. It drove me nuts. 
This movie made me so mad. I almost fell asleep more than once, but I couldn't because I was watching the movie in a history through film class. What sorry waste of my time. 150 minutes of my life that I wish I could take back. I don't have the words to express how much I hated that movie. If I could give it a zero, I would. It was boring and near impossible to follow. Never watching that movie again unless I'm having a really hard time sleeping.",The New World
192,amolad,"Has its moments, but...",6,10 December 2005,"I loved ""The Thin Red Line"" as well as Terrence Malick's earlier movies, and ""The New World,"" which I saw tonight at a guild screening, is very similar in style to ""The Thin Red Line."" It is intensely visual, with many wordless sequences, and uses interior monologues/voice-over from several characters. Also like ""The Thin Red Line,"" it creates a tapestry of nature and the elements to define its characters. The landscape, rivers, fields and forests are very much prominent characters here. The film is at times utterly mesmerizing and captivating on a visual level. However, it saddens me to say that overall, ""The New World"" just isn't THAT emotionally involving. At 2.5 hours, it's long. And what's worse, it feels it.The cast does a fine job, and Q'orianka Kilcher is especially talented (and lovely), but the script isn't as strong or as focused as it needed to be. Still, I admired several sequences of powerfully visual storytelling, especially those depicting the lives of the native Americans, so in the end I would have to call my opinion mixed.",The New World
193,Aldri7,what was the point?,4,17 April 2006,"I can't vouch for the historical accuracy or inaccuracy of this movie, only the entertainment value. For me, historical information if it is presented well is entertainment. Documentaries are entertainment. This movie was not entertainment. Pocohantus was very beautiful in an mysterious, exotic sort of way, but having the camera spend so much time focused on her was like saying ""look, I have nothing much to say here so just stare at her instead"". Which I did, but like all eye candy, there is no nutritional value. Yet I wanted nutritional value with my movie. This proved exceedingly hard for another reason - the settler's dialogue almost needed subtitles as badly as the Indian's dialogue. I could barely make out what they were saying at times. Meanwhile, Capt Smith mutters when he speaks at all, apparently as mesmerized into muteness by Pocohantus as much as I was.I didn't stick around until the end as it was getting late. I do think that there was a germ of a statement trying to get expressed in this movie, trying to get out. Something about how supposedly ""primitive"" savages are really far more advanced in many ways than supposedly ""civilized"" settlers. It would have been nice to see this theme developed with real historical insights, but unfortunately the director was too captivated with Pocohantus and the love story to allow much time for that.",The New World
194,xTkAx,Wow!,1,5 February 2006,"This would have been a totally awesome movie if the year was 1913, and they showed it in full color - it would have stood as the movie to beat for decades! But it's not. I saw this movie and i thought it was alright at the start, but it was hard to understand the dialouge and there was a lot of voice overs too, which didn't help too much. I don't know the real story of Pochoantas, and i guess if i did the movie would have made more sense. Anyway after watching about 1h 30m of this movie i got really bored and i started skipping a little bit ahead, and as it went on i started skipping a bit more ahead with increasing intervals until the movie was over. I compressed the last hour into about 20 minutes, and got most of the idea. But i tell you if this was a movie i went to see in the theater, i would have walked out for sure. This is like the first movie i've ever watched that i actually didn't want to watch anymore. I'm glad downloaded it instead and didn't pay to watch this movie. Hollywood films have been sucking a lot lately, which is why so many people are downloading flicks instead - they're tired of being ripped off! People want to have a good time in the theater, not pay 10 bucks to nap in an uncomfortable char, or get utterly bored to death. I'll give this movie another chance if they show it on cable or if I find the DVD out on the street. Hopefully it might be a better with the subtitles, and the ability to play 2x 3x speed.Bottom line: wait for cable/DVD.",The New World

On initial thoughts i wasn't too impressed with the movie because i thought it too slow. After a few hours when the film had finished i found myself reveling in how beautiful and how understated this film really is. The long establishing shots are meaningful and used to great affect for this epic love tale.Don't expect a formulaic heart wrenching romance at the center of this movie as it will disappoint. It is replaced by a truly heartfelt deeper than words relationship established through gestures and actions, it is truly wondrous.Colin Farrell is subtly commanding as John Smith, showing that his performances have aged beyond blockbusters. All the actors do an extremely good job considering the amount of dialogue in this film as it is used sparely. This film is just short of completely breath taking.

196,homespun13,So awful it was painful to watch,1,1 June 2006,"This movie was so boring it was an ordeal to get through it. The cover's claim ""The Best Historical Epic Romance Since Titanic"" is completely misleading. It makes one think this is a good movie, comparable to Titanic. It may be based on a true story, so it may be historical, but there is absolutely NOTHING romantic about it, and the word ""epic"" applied to this movie is a complete joke. It's too bad that the final product is so bad, because they certainly did spend a lot of money on the production - the set, costumes, etc. Those are okay. The cinematography is quite beautiful at times. The music is pretty annoying, but the real problem is the action, or should I say the lack of it. There is next to nothing happening for most of the movie and the little that is happening makes almost no sense, there is very little continuity. Even the little there is in terms of a plot is pretty unbelievable, like Pocahontas learning a new language fluently seemingly overnight. The actors can't be blamed for this disaster, they had very little chance to ""act"". Overall, I thought this is one of the worst movies I've ever sat through and my most sincere recommendation is for viewers to avoid it. If you are curious, rent it, but for heaven's sake don't buy it. You'll be lucky if you can sit through this movie even once.",The New World

The story is telling how Pocahontas and John Smith meet. It also talks about the conflicts it caused between the two families but mostly between Pocahontas and her dad. They are trying to tell the story of how protective they are of their culture. I noticed that the houses are smaller then most houses today. There were not a lot of things in the houses. People had to hunt or grow their food. They had to travel by foot or by boat, there were no cars. I was wondering what their wepons were made out of. How did the mot lose toes walking barefoot? Where did the ladies get their clothes from? They are all dressed similar in the movies we have watched. The houses are all about the same size as each other. I liked how they didn't really talk throughout the movie. I also liked how John communicated with Pocahontas family. I also liked how she worked her way into the new world. I wish that at the end of the movie they would have made it way more clear that what we were seeing was just a dream that she was having. I didn't really like this movie. It was hard to tell what was going on between the two people when they don't really talk. They made it hard to understand what was happening. I would want to see more talking between each other.

198,gwydno,Pretentious but hollow movie. Really disappointing,2,11 March 2006,"After seeing this movie yesterday, I can't describe it but as deceiving. Supposedly, it is a story about how the clash between cultures changed the style of life known in the Americas, through the eyes of an Indian ""princess"", as well as a story of love and resignation. Hardly any of these objectives is reached. The movie is incredibly slow. The pretentious monologues, the apparently ""espiritual"" voices in off, are pretentious and at times laughable. The key moment in the film, when Smith leaves, is so quick that it calls to no emotion. Q'Orianka Kilcher may seem a good choice in the first minutes, but soon you realize that this girl has only two expressions to show to the camera: her lovely smile that she shows a few times, and all the rest a boring mask that is supposed to reflect serenity, but fails completely in its purpose. When the film ended, all the people seemed awed. No one talked! I don't remember having seen the people so silent after a movie, without a comment.

One about missed expectations, incredible durations, chopped and incoherent editing, stone-cold acting. Oh, look, Jonathan Pryce. Oh, look, tall grass. Oh, look, the back of someone's neck. Now where was I. Oh, yes, I was just saying that this film doesn't go anywhere, while trying and failing to attain too many goals. It loses itself into the worst editing job I have ever seen, and goes on for hours... Hey, did you just see this spider. Look, some mossy bark. Hey, a close-up on a flower. Where was I again. Oh yes, Colin Farrell still is undoubtedly one of the worst actors ever, not providing us with a single glimpse of what ""emotion"" means in such a long film. There's probably but two different facial expressions displayed during over two hours of film. Hey, look, another sunset. Did you just see that tree? Where was I. Historical inaccuracies and anachronisms galore, the filmmakers, although they proudly announce at the beginning of the film that it is set in 1607, do not take account of this a single minute. Hey look, tall grass. Oh, look, a woman's face in close-up. Hey, look at the clouds while we try to make you confused a little bit more. One example: Mozart (lifetime 1756-1791). Okay, his music is heard several times throughout the film, a music that has been written for emotions and feelings felt more than 150 years later. Colin Farrell's body is covered with tattoos, which make absolutely no sense since he was a colonist, and it is yet another element that breaks one viewer's good intentions of focusing on the film, and on believing in the filmmakers' good will. Did I say that James Horner's soundtrack is nothing else than a few blokes making the same three notes and the same loud sounds with horns for two hours? Hey, look, yet again some tall grass. Hey, look, Colin Farrell has an earring, cause he's such a cool 1607 colonist. Hey, look, all of them have ultra-brite teeth, and we swear to god, it IS 1607! They just had toothpaste back then, didn't you know? But hey, look at some grass while they're still looking for a decent screenplay. Ah, too bad, they didn't find one. They're just going to do some pretentious voice-overs to make it look like a Jean-Luc Godard or a Marguerite Duras film, whoa, all they had to do is tell the story of Pocahontas, maybe it wasn't as easy as it sounds (yeah right), but why did they think Godard-style voice-overs would have brought the film any interest? Oh, wow, look at that spider. Are you still thinking it's a bad film? Now just take another look at that sunset then. It's the title of the film for Pete's sake, ""The New World"", that's what you came here to see, so it has to have sunsets right? You didn't come here to see ""The Good Film"" or ""The Intense Acting"" or ""The Screenplay with Words in it"" or ""The Director Who Actually Directs and Doesn't Think He's Hot S#!&"". Now did you just see this amazingly tall grass? TALL GRASS! I REPEAT: TALL GRASS FOR ANYONE TO SEE, AT THE CINEMAS AROUND THE WORLD, FOR JUST A FEW DOLLARS. Wow. ""Mother, who am I?"" say the voice-overs. ""Mother, what is love"". ""Mother, what time is it?"" ""Mother, why the hell did I accept to be part of that pretentious and empty film?"" Hey look, a pink flamingo. The special effects are also amazing: the special effects guys successfully erased the National Geographic watermark from each frame of the film. I'm sure Colin Farrell's x-rated video was better-acted than this. Oh, here comes Christian Batman, here to save Pocahontas from Cap'n Crunch with his long hair. Hey, look, natives depicted as if they used to look and behave like animals. Absurd and insulting. Hey, look, absolutely no respect whatsoever for anyone in the cinema. Or for anyone whose life-story is being narrated on screen. Hey, look, a flock of birds, but not the same birds, new birds! ""Mother, why did I pay 5 euros to go see that film?"", oh no, that wasn't one of the voice-overs, that was me, sorry. At a crucial moment of the film, Pocahontas says ""I'm sorry"". Look at that. Amazingly blank dialogs all throughout, totally dull and pointless. ""Mother, what is this film about? -Aflock of birds my dear"". Oh, look, the 1607 man that's so evolved and cool is chewing on grass, so cool. Oh, Batman and Pocahontas have a baby now. Hey look, it rains again, marvelous, stupefying, the people who made this film so respect their audience. Oh, look, a music piece by Wagner (lifetime 1813-1883), grand isn't it, how music travels back in time. Maybe Mallick's next film will be about cavemen and prehistorical romance between a tattooed Colin Farrell with bright teeth and a flock of birds. Music by Eminem cause it's so cool and accurate ya know. But I wouldn't say Colin Farrell has that much of an acting range to play a caveman. I tried to write this review in the same way T.

200,murray-morison,Meaningful tale beautifully told,9,5 May 2009,"John Smith was a real soldier, adventurer and colonist. Pocahontas was a favoured daughter of a local important Powhatan chieftain. She was a young teenager when they met and it is reliably recorded that her interventions aided the colonists as they tried to survive an early tough winter. Much else about the story has been embellished in comic books and the Disney cartoon. Terence Mallick takes the elements of the story that are believed to be true to give substance his excellent exploration of the contact between two contrasting societies with very different needs and interests. Yet this compelling film is not primarily a history. It is a meditation presented through beautiful imagery offset by savagery and stupidity. Colin Farrell manages to capture the enigmatic Smith with his genuine wonder about this new world. In one scene he proceeds up a river on his own looking like something escaped from the Tower of London, for he wears a metal helm and body armor as he wades through a river. He is of course completely vulnerable and either very foolhardy or extremely brave. He is easily captured and shortly after we see the well known, but possibly fictitious, life-saving intervention of Pocahontas. Q'orianka Kilcher is a most convincing Pocahontas, deftly combining child-like awe at the beauties of the world around her and great spirit when it comes to dealing with Smith and the somewhat gross colonists. The film has a dreamlike quality in parts that is reminiscent of Tarkovsky, who delighted in slow explorations of water and the beauties of the natural world. For each society, the 'Naturals' as they are described, and the Colonists, the others are so beyond understanding that they might as well be from a dream. It is this dreamlike quality that pervades the whole film. Perhaps the abrupt editing and the way the story is presented in chunks with very spare dialogue may be too stylised for some. It worked for me, as did the musical score which is a counterpoint to the imagery. This is a film to watch when you have time to become really absorbed. It is not a film to miss.",The New World

I appreciated the fact that this film gave us the truer version of Pocahontas, rather than the garbage we're fed in school. However, even that didn't carry this film into cinematic wonder. This film was terrible. And can someone tell me why no one bothered to cover up Colin Farrel's tattoos? The script for this two and a half hour epic piece of crap couldn't have been longer than that of a half hour sitcom. I feel sorry for the composer. He had to go through the painstaking trouble of trying to fill in fifteen minute gaps with music that (hopefully) carried the story along...because the actors sure weren't doing it. I know that with film, you are supposed to show rather than tell, but how long do you need to show two people making out? I should have known this film was crap, it did get several Oscar nominations.

It is about settlers coming to the new world. It shows how the natives live their lives. It shows how John Smith meets Pocahontas. He has to leave her and she meets the second John. Then she loves the other John. The movie was made pretty recently so the technology is pretty good. The acting was good for the time period. I don't know how the natives lived their life so it seemed like good acting. Our teacher was telling us about some of the stuff that actually happened in the time period. And some of the events do not add up to the movie and real life. I have not seen that many movies that have been close to this movie. I liked how they set up the setting in the new world. The fight scenes seemed very realistic and it was cool to see the tactics they used back then. I didn't like how they ended the movie having Pocahontas die. The overall movie was OK. It wasn't an outstanding movie but I would not mind if I had to watch it again.I would watch a different movie made by this director. He does a good job at telling a story and has good camera work.

There is something about it that strongly appeals to the emotions, and I have recently visited the forests and Cypress Gardens swamplands of the Carolinas so I know what I am talking about... Truly exceptional, there is a scene at the end where one of Powhatan's chiefs played by Wes Studi is in England to report on Englishmen and their god to return with this information to his chief. He walks up the steps to the trees in the gardens of this stately home ( Hampton Court) looking and contemplating this new country, the people and their culture, advanced and different. I had to reach for the Kleenex, wonderful film, equally as good as Malick's Thin Red Line WWII movie. I am happy there are sensitive men like Terrence Malick making finely crafted important movies like this. Qorianka Kilcher in her debut role is worth the price of admission. Christian Bale and Colin Farrell add to the enjoyment. A beautiful, classic memorable film and I give it 10 stars... from Malcolm in Toronto",The New World
205,tingnting,Why did they make this movie?,1,14 June 2006,"I expected this movie to be a cross between Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans. Unfortunately it proved to be a cross between a boring storyline mixed with weak fighting scenes.As a drama it's weak. As an action story it's weaker. As a historical tale it's even worse. The only saving grace is an A-list cast...Colin Farrell and Christian Bale. Sadly, none of their characters are explored in any great depth. Coupled with constant Shakespearian a-la-""how do I love the"" monologues, this has to be the worst movie I've seen in recent years...and I've seen Gigli! Stay away from this movie. Don't rent it.

206,pforrest-2,"Beautiful to look at, but self-indulgent, appalling script and direction",1,16 July 2007,"I wish I hadn't watched this film. Gorgeous cinematography but grossly flawed direction, dialogue and feel, with tedious sudden cuts to black, random bits of natural footage inserted, and a tendency to avoid having the speaker in shot. There's one classic moment where a woman is walking along the other side of the palisade from Pocahontas, who is walking at the same pace, listening. Exactly as the woman reached the end of the palisade her speech ended too. It reminded me of those scenes in nudist films where convenient props hide private parts. Here, the idea was to avoid the indecency of seeing actors actually speaking lines... It was almost as if they had had problems with lip-sync. Another thing that really got to me was the way that every boat or ship voyage, even across the Atlantic, was illustrated with... river footage. There were some classy actors in this film, but the direction didn't give them any help at all, apart from making them look superb. In fact I suspect casting was done largely on looks.",The New World

208,cadenixo,Movie Review,5,30 August 2018,I watched this movie for my history class. I learning some things I didnt know before hand. The plot of this movie was to show life in the new world and Poachahontis journey. The story starts with Jamestown setting up camp and then they run into problems with the naturals. They eventually fought and lost men. Poachatis tryed to stop from fighting and eventually moved to England. It must have been really hard to live in a time like theres. Today we have it really easy and I think some of us take it for granted. For example they had wooden structures for there houses and I bet it was freezing cold at night. The only question I have is the ages of the characters because in the movie pocahontis is 14 but in real life she was around 10. It really makes you think about that because john was a much older Man. One thing I lked about the movie was the camera angles and sounds. It was very cool to listen to all the sounds. For example listening to the peaceful water running down stream sounds cool. I also liked the fighting scene because I like action. One thing I didnt like was how long the movie was it felt like it dragged on forever. Ithought the movie was pretty good concidering it was about history. I thought it was intersting and I learned some new things i didnt know before. I would like to see movies with the same director because he has good ideas and good camera positioning.,The New World
209,clarke-21,Only Terrence Maick,7,7 August 2008,"Terrence Malick is some kind of cinematic genius. He has a unique way of writing a story so that it coincides with the directing and cinematography.This movie is fantastic. Set design, cast and art direction. I was totally prepared to hate this movie when I rented it and saw the box.Turned out to be a surprise and an acting performance by Collin Ferrel that is not only tolerable, but strong. Christian Bale delivers here as well. Surprisingly, the only person who disappointed me here was Wes Dudi. Is he like the default Indian for every Native American movie? He didn't have an important role in the movie and didn't need to be in it.Add this to your Netflix rotation.",The New World
210,yorkshire_keith,It's OK But don't get over excited,5,4 August 2006,"Love it and hate it, there's truth in all the comments I've read about this film. For a start it sets it's self a tough task. Two people have to become deeply in touch with each other within a very short time of meeting despite not speaking a word of each others language. Love and respect takes time to build for intelligent people who can communicate verbally, so one assumes it's likely to take longer if you have to learn to speak first. Of course one of these is a teenager so I guess that reduces the intelligence involved maybe reducing the healthy caution shown by women of more experience but in real terms it all happens too fast. Perhaps Malik thought to himself ""they'll never swallow them falling in love over a winter without speaking, unless I stress every little nuance of body language, every instance of alternative communication, each small gesture, and turn what is a short period into what seems like an interminable one. He certainly succeeded on that objective. The middle of this film is just too long. Good writers know how to do the passing of time but this is this films failing. The Pocahontas story was crying out to be told well after the usual Disney Disgrace. Teenagers and older the world over know the names but are old enough now to realise what sickening mush Walt's destroyers will turn every story they kick to death into but Malik failed to resist the Smith love affair as well! (It never happened, she was maybe 10, certainly no more than 12.) and making it seem possible destroyed what was in many many ways a beautiful film. Locations were excellent, cinematography epic, behaviour of all the other characters brilliant. The meeting scene between white and red superb, Smiths time with the aboriginals and the clashes later carried out in a way that brought home the differences in every aspect of their respective lives except that both races include the wise and the not so.Those people who rave over this as a seminal experience probably wouldn't want to admit they can't actually see the pair of undies they bought from that special highly recommended tailor. And those who tell you it's the worst film of all time had actually decided it wasn't going to come up to the standard of Police Academy 4 within the first 4 minutes. It has some good points, it makes some very good points but it isn't Maliks best work there's a beginning and an end but the middle drags and drags.",The New World
211,ericagui,Review for The New World,6,30 August 2018,"I am watching this film for my history through film class. I have to write a review on it.The film is about Pocahontas and how she came to a new world. She meets a man named John Smith in the beginning and they later part. She moves to Jamestown where she learns English. She meets another man named john rolfe and marries him. I noticed they dressed different due to the different time period. The natives focused a lot on connection with nature. The age difference with the male and females did not matter due to it being in the older times. There was also cannibalism at some point throughout the movie due to no food. There was nothing really that made me question the accuracy of the film. I dont know much about Pocahontas. The ages were off thats all i really know. Some connections I can make from other movies Ive seen of Pocahontas is the disney version. She meets john smith. Three things I liked were the actors. I also liked the scenery they did for the natives. Another thing I liked was the costumes they used. One thing I didnt like were the camera angles. Overall I thought the movie was interesting. I liked it in general. The overall story of the movie was good. I like the actors that were in there as well, I think they did a good job.",The New World
212,jackfull,A unique story telling expirience,9,30 August 2018,"Hello and welcome to my review on The New World. I watched this movie for a U.S History through film class and here are my thoughts on it. The filmmaker (Terrance Malick) tells the story of exploratory captain John Smith, and how he comes to meet the other main character Pocahontas, a native american girl living in America. John Smith runs into her when he gets lost on a trading exhibition to reestablish his position as captain. The natives want to kill him, but right before he's about to be killed, Pocahontas throws herself on him to save his life. He then spends time living among the natives (or naturals as they are called. This is something very important to know that will help you understand the film better). He learns their ways and culture and in return, he teaches her his ways and language. I won't spoil the rest, you have to watch and find out. For the most part, this film is pretty well executed. The framing is clean, the colors are distinct, and the camera quality is great (for 2005). There are some things that I raised an eyebrow to concerning this films historical accuracy. Number one, by the end of the film, Pocahontas is completely are nearly fluent in English. This is odd considering the fact that near the end of the film, John Rolfe uses some very sophisticated English when talking to Pocahontas. She somehow understands all of it, and the emotion behind the language.",The New World

Half way through it I contemplated turning it off in fear of it falling into cliché of mindless violence, and this way holding on to the grace it portrayed.

214,rawkidd,Too less,3,20 March 2006,"I was looking forward to that movie. Not only because Colin Farrell is playing some sort of character he really handles well, also I hoped to lose myself in a sweeping story and picture.First of all: The real annoying soundtrack. It starts in the opening scene, where these discoverers are arriving. Goodness, who decided to put this weirdo-sound into this movie ? I think it is one of the worst sound i've ever heard in a movie.The story respectively the dialogs are brain-dead stupid insomuch. Although i've tried hard to sympathise with any character, i didn't make it. I just couldn't. There is nothing personal in the story, nothing captivating. The pictures look not bad, since they often return some kind of hidden mystery, but it is too less.It is boring, annoying and just a dumb waste of time and money.",The New World
215,NotSureifthisis7734,A Footnote to Days of Heaven -- but what a footnote.,10,22 January 2006,"I saw ""Days of Heaven"" exactly 27 years ago today. I remember thinking as I was driving home, this man (Terrence Malick) will never be able to top himself. As a artist he had gone as far as he possibly could go. He would never get out of those wheat fields. In other words, I was in religious awe of what he had accomplished.Perhaps Terry agreed, because he was not to make another movie for 20 years. Malick is, I believe, obsessed with myth. Days of Heaven is a retelling of the biblical myth of Abraham and Sarah, transformed and reset in turn of the century America. But the story Pocahantas has no biblical counterpart. This is pure American, and the telling of the story is as fresh as it can be. That it is an American myth speaks well for this country and its history. True, Malick pulls his punches on both sides, but the movie has a look and feel of astonishing historical reality. The Indians are as frightening as they are fascinating, the settlers are as desperate as they are determined. Tragedy under such circumstances was inevitable, but what linger is a tale of such beauty and poignancy, it may not be possible to do the story again -- though I am certain at some future time, someone will try.Technically, the film is a marvel. This is Kilcher's movie and she carries it wonderfully. 2005 was a great year for young girl actresses (Dakota Fanning, Georgia Henley), but Kilcher surpasses them all. The male leads offer great support to her performance: tough and taciturn (perhaps a bit too taciturn in the case of Colin Ferrell). I especially liked that all the characters were treated with respect. I kept waiting for the obligatory evil white guy to say something like; ""Don't want no injun in our town . .. ."" Didn't happen. These are real people on all sides trying to cope with a situation well beyond their control or understanding. But they rise to the doomed occasion wonderfully.There is truth here even if (parts of it) didn't happen (or at least we are highly unsure if the particular events happened.) See the movie. Yes, there are plenty of echoes of Days of Heaven (yes, Malick will never get out of those wheat fields), but it doesn't hold the movie back. Unreservedly recommended as the best film of 2005 (which was, in retrospect, a good year.)",The New World
216,MyNeighborFanboy,"A Tender, Poetic Fourth Masterpiece from Terrence Malick",9,11 January 2008,"There are some directors out there just begging for heated discussions among film fans. Godard, Lynch, Kubrick, all have been made the subject of tussles in the chatrooms. Any director who challenges convention is likely to be hailed among some crowds and despised among others.Terrence Malick is one of the more interesting directors to divide people. His work breaks convention in a way no one else could've imagined. Almost like a fusion between film, painting, and poetry, movies like Days of Heaven and The Thin Red Line blur the line between epic masterwork and narrative hodge-podge. Many words have been used to describe these films, especially ""pretentious."" Yet, I would never dream of calling a man who merely communicates the poetry and philosophy of nature such a word. In fact, I would argue his films merely tell the truth.Nevertheless, many are flat out bored by his films, and The New World may just be the most ""boring"" of them all. There's even less plot here than Days of Heaven, but to say there's no story is preposterous. Malick is a storyteller of a different color, creating a clash between the inner thoughts and outer appearance of his characters to capture two different worlds, just as he did in The Thin Red Line; the reality, and the truth.The biggest mistake marketers made in advertising this film was to make it out as a love story in the vein of Titanic. In truth, this ""love story"" isn't between the two leads, but rather between the coming together of two cultures. When the English arrive at their landing, Smith sees this as a rebirth for him. He's been condemned to death for mutiny, and only the last minute mercy of Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) allows him a second chance. Arriving at America, they come in contact with a local tribe, but fall out of their favor when an Indian is killed for stealing an ax. Smith is sent to lead an expedition to find the king of the local tribes, but gets separated from his group and captured by this king. Only the last minute intervention from Pocahontas saves John Smith from execution.We see John Smith practically annexed into the culture. He makes a change while staying with this tribe, interacting with the people and making friends with the warriors. By the end of this film, both Pocahontas and John Smith will have been transformed by their interactions with the opposing cultures. Whereas their associates choose to battle the other side, Smith and Pocahontas learn to embrace the other side, to the extent where they drift apart.Pocahontas's change is more radical than Smith's. Once Smith has left her life, she finds a new romance with John Rolfe (played by that talented, versatile actor Christian Bale) and becomes a regular English housewife. When she and John Smith next meet, they've drifted so far apart from their former selves that they simply can't connect anymore.The New World's editing is going to be difficult for some people to swallow. So many snippets that not relating to the plot are thrown in, some might dismiss it as the result of over-indulgence. Rather, what these clips do is provide a dream logic that brings the viewers attention away from what's concrete and toward the more metaphysical elements of the story. The ponds, the grass, the sky, Malick finds the beauty in nature. As always, he's left his previous coworkers behind to create a totally new look and sound. Emmanuel Lubezki and James Horner both deliver lush, emotive work. Horner has never written a better score, nor had it used so well (his work is often tragically overused, drowning its original intent). I cannot explain why this is transcendent, brilliant direction. You must be willing to give yourself over to it. You may be able to do that, you may not.All things considered, no other film is like The New World. That may be good or bad, depending on who you are. Nevertheless, I thoroughly recommend it to anyone looking for something daring, original, and insightful. It's certainly not the first Malick film I'd lend to any of my friends, but if they showed an appreciation for this style of film-making, they would surely fall in love with this film.",The New World

I really didn't get it, and I must say I really wanted to like it. I don't mind slow movies, Thin Red Line was slow, but this was ridiculous. The problem was that it was repetitively slow. There were at least 20 repetitions of a scene that the director said something to the effect of ""Colin, you love her, but you're pained by it, you realize your culture is evil and you're going to bring her ruin, so look in love and pained at the the same time"", he did a good job the first time, but it got really boring after the 10th.

But indeed, I wasn't at all expecting to watch scenery on a movie theatre that cost me money. I mean, I can see scenery on discovery channel and no need to go to movie theatres.The whole movie, I would say 90% of it does not involve understandable human verbal communication. To clarify that, in this movie - we have 2 civilization that is Britons and Native Indians. While britons so little , the native Indian speak in their own language (Only 5% of it were translated). Its rude for me to put it this way, but it seems that I felt like I was really observing a zoo.I don't understand why there is so little verbal communication in this movie, while as we can see - even ScobbyDoo can talk.There is no real set of problem defined in this movie. The conflict and confrontation of European Colony and Native Indian is poorly unfold. In one scene the European fight with Indian, while in few next scenes - they seems to be friend again. While the war contribute to little part of the movie, much of the movie is spent on observing scenery, human activities, lake, mountain, sun or inaudible conversation which further deviate and deter the movie quality.This movie is my first and biggest disappointment on movie.

221,gryffindor249,Like Watching War Paint Dry,1,26 January 2006,"Let me first say that I am a big fan of historical epics. As a matter of fact I joyfully sat through all 6+ hours of Bertolucci's ""1900"" in one sitting at a revival house; in short, I am not some dolt who wandered in because ""Underworld 2"" was sold out.That said and trying to avoid hyperbole, this is among the most pretentious, self-flaggelating, ponderous pieces of bullshit ever forced upon an unsuspecting public. I was so bored I actually felt nauseated.Mr. Malick does not know the first thing about dramatic writing-that is why 60% of the words heard in the film are voiceovers by John Smith, Pocohontas and The Tobacco Farmer That Looks Like a Movie Star-who even though they are respectively a military man, a Native American princess and a One Dimensional Plot Device all narrate with essentially the same voice. This gets old rather quickly. If all three of these characters have the ability to narrate, then from whose perspective is the story unfolding? The answer to that question is the obsessive camera that luxuriates on floral shots that look like they are outtakes from Walt Disney's True Life Adventure Series, while the real action is relegated offstage.It is surely a case of The Emperor Has No Clothes here, people are afraid to call the movie painfully dull due to the pretensions of artsy-fartsy that are present; worried they will be accused of ""not getting it."" This is the reason that the reviews amongst professional critics are evenly split 50/50 between raves and pans, very few are middle ground. This alone should warn the moviegoer that one should tread forward with great caution if planning to see this snoozefest.One last thought: He cut seventeen minutes from this?

223,titanrd1,A slow paced visual masterpiece,9,4 February 2006,"One of the most enduring American legends has made it's way to the silver screen under the title ""The New World."" In this new adaptation of the Pocahontas story, visionary writer/director, Terrence Malick weaves together a realistic tale of love, loss and betrayal against the epic backdrop of the first European settlement in America and striking images of natural beauty.It is a seemingly average April day, in seventeenth century Virginia, as the natives carry out their morning rituals, when they sight three mystifying vessels on the waterfront. Among the curious onlookers is the pure and exquisite Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher). Little does she realize the significance of this moment - that the 103 European men inside the ships will change her life and alter her world for all time.While the Native Americans ponder the foreign vessels and their contents, the Europeans disembark. With few volunteers, Smith is selected to lead a small group of settlers upriver to speak with the local chieftain, Powhatan (August Schellenberg). After a short, but perilous journey, Smith is captured by the natives and taken directly to Powhatan who sentences the outsider to death. However, fat steps in when Pocahontas throws herself on Smith pleading for her father (Powhatan) to show mercy.Pocahontas' act of compassion promptly sparks a relationship that would never be forgotten. Their love transcends language and ethnicity it just is. The two breathe each others' breaths, learn to communicate with one another and develop a bond stronger than either has ever known before. However, their romance is short-lived because Powhatan, who is made uneasy by his daughters closeness to this stranger sends Smith back to the European settlement from which he came. Upon his return, he finds the colonists in poor health and is forced to help them survive the harsh winter. As spring approaches, the relationship between the settlers and natives grows tense and Pocahontas' lingering devotion to Smith provokes her father to disown her. The times ahead are filled with hardships for everyone as the Natives and Europeans fight for the land. Obviously, we know who wins.As more colonists and supplies arrive, the colony can finally prosper and Pocahontas has come to live with the Europeans. She and a changed Smith try to pick up where they left off, but Smith knows that the relationship can't last. He will soon be embarking on another voyage in pursuit of a passage to the Pacific. As he departs, he instructs John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a fellow settler, to wait a certain period of time and then tell Pocahontas that he had died. Needless to say, he does not plan on returning.In the time leading up to and following Smith's departure, Pocahontas is transformed into an entirely different person; a proper lady, complete with corset, massive gown and heeled shoes. She even loses her name when she is baptized as Rebecca. However, it is not until she is told that Smith had died, that she looses the dynamic spirit which had always made her so unique in the community. For weeks, she does not speak. She has lost everything imaginable and goes day to day without ambition, in a state of utter sorrow until John Rolfe, who has always had feelings for Pocahontas, decides to act on them and before you know it, they are married with a child together. He loves her unconditionally, but it is evident that little has changed in her heart when she gets word that Smith is not dead. With this new news, she jumps at the invitation she receives from the royal family to appear at a celebration in her honor. The remainder of the film follows her own journey of discovery in a world that is new to her.Contrary to what the trailers would have you believe, Colin Farrell is not the star of this film, which primarily focuses on Pocahontas as the world she had always known comes to an end and a knew one begins. This film has a phenomenal cast. Colin Farrell and Christian Bale are perfect in their respective rolls, but it is Q'orianka Kilcher (in her feature starring debut) that easily gives my favorite performance by an actress in 2005. She effortlessly captures the exuberance, curiosity and childlike innocence associated with the historical character she portrays. Terrence Malick has returned to what he does best. With a script he wrote in the 70's and an artistic eye, he has crafted a film of an artistic caliber rarely seen on the big screen. Some doubt his methods, but it is hard to dismiss the final product.""The New World"" features some of the best cinematography (now nominated for an Academy Award) and art direction I've seen in any film this past year. The camera work is subtle and always appropriate. The sets are convincing, and the native occupants of the New World transport the viewer to a time before modern civilization spread through America. The only major flaw in this film is it's, at times, tediously slow pacing. This is by no means an edge-of-your-seat adventure epic and it shouldn't be. However, I think Malick greatly overestimated the importance of shots of nature. While, I cannot deny that nature is a pivotal aspect of this story, I cannot say that the abundance of these shots are an asset to the viewer who can often find them jarring (albeit tasteful) to the main storyline.This is definitely a movie that people will love or hate, but I see no problem with it other than it's slow pacing which is easily compensated by it's remarkable story and superb visuals. ""The New World"" is a genuine work of art - the kind we don't see often enough. 9/10",The New World
224,PulpVideo,"Con-job, not Art",4,3 January 2007,"If you are not a devotee of Malick, don't waste your time on this one. You won't get it and you won't like it. If you liked that other con-job of Malick's, ""The Thin Red Line,"" which was admittedly better than this film (but that's not saying much), you'll want to like this one, because it's more of the trite crap that passes for high-art cinema these days.If, as I do, you genuinely like artistic, metaphorical movies such as those made by Bergman, Fellini, and Godard then I think you will be mightily disappointed by this pretender. The problem, I think, is that Malick tries to straddle two worlds of cinema, believing he can bring high-art to the average movie-watcher, or action-drama to the avant-garde, and he fails at both. If the soldiers in ""The Thin Red Line"" weren't a bunch of mournful, whussy poets, he might have had a decent war film, or if he had put his warrior-poets on a metaphorical battlefield using experimental staging techniques, like Lars Von Trier, he might have made a good art-film.As with the English colonists & the Native Americans in ""The New World,"" the two cinema cultures do not mix. The whispered, prosaic narratives by Smith (most wrongfully played by Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) are trite, uninteresting, and only serve interrupt the flow of the story, where the action & dialogue were doing a sufficient job.The only reason this film was nominated for anything was because the nasty old men of Hollywood just wanted to see Q'Orianka Kilcher at the award ceremonies in a tight, designer dress. Note almost all nominations were for her.Admittedly, the cinematography was outstanding, and the camera-work in the battle scenes truly enhanced the feeling of being in a disorganized melee, but that's just not enough to support a dreadfully boring and otherwise false film.",The New World

I almost hate to say that as I enjoyed the acting, the pacing, and the photography. In fact, I was really looking forward to this film.Upon watching it (the day it came out in theaters), I found it to be completely historically inaccurate. As a descendant of John Rolfe and Pocahontas, I have always hated the romance myth concerning John Smith. This simply never happened. In reality she was only about 11.The worst is that there is a truly beautiful love story between Rolfe and Pocahontas that was never really explored. I counted on Malick to have enough respect for his subject(s) to portray it truthfully, instead of making a hackneyed attempt at rewriting history. He let me down. If a filmmaker can't respect his subject, then I can't respect his work. I will never watch this film again.If you want the truth, read a book.

I brought the perspective of a born-again, saved, washed-in-the-blood, King James Bible-toting calvinistic baptist Vietnam and Desert Storm vet who voted for Kerry to this film, and was just blown away. At heart I feel the film is evangelistic at its core; the subtext is the passing of the old world of pagan America and the coming of the Christian. The stark contrasts between the old and the new worlds of this movie made me so thankful to have been born in a Christian land! I was so filled with emotion when the little princess prayed, and felt great swellings of feeling when she met the King and Queen of England (must get the soundtrack!)....to top it off, the 'art' cinema here in Atlanta was playing ""Naked in Ashes"". So I ended up coming out of an old fashioned double feature quite literally weak in the knees. The demographics on the stage of history speak for themselves, but when put into artistic form as this, every thinking person must agree that, for all the problems in the world, and for all the problems inherent in human organizations such as ""churchianity"" - Christ is truly the answer.",The New World
228,jessiejones-59844,A story retold.,8,30 August 2018,"I was watching this for my History through Film class. Although, within the first section of the movie my attention was captured by the camera angles, back story and plot. The main story line is third person version of Pochantas (Rebecca later on is her name). It tells the story of her meeting John Smith and some time together there. Then she moves on to just being a colonist loyal to the king after being disowned by her father. Later she meets John Ralph and mothers a child for him. I noticed the camera angles and sets design was all on purpose to try and set certain moods for the various areas. The area where the natives lived showed more of a free flowing movement that creates a peaceful, calming, natural approach. The area of Jamestown was harsh and pitiful in the start but mellowed out with time. England showed an idea of sufistication and poise; not my cup of tea. I question the historical accuracy with the rituals shown of the native tribes, I'd like to know if that was correct for that time period and time continuing on. John Smith meeting her as Rebecca isn't true. A connection I saw in this with an other movie was I saw a raccoon and my first thought was Meeko from the Disney movie Pochoantas. I enjoyed getting to watch point of view that for shadowed many different sides to the settlers, natives, and English. I disliked the time jumps that weren't exactly pointed out it looked like weeks when it was years. Overall a movie that should be appreciated instead of out cast. The directing was different and enchanting. Moving forward anyone who sees this film should see the world differently then prior.",The New World
229,NoLittleLamb,Artistic Without Substance.,3,15 May 2007,"This was basically about the ""true story"" of Pocahontas and John Smith. Not your Disney version. Although, I think this is one time I would have preferred the Disney version to whatever sort of artsy drama we would call this. John Smth and Pocahontas meet, they fall in love under bad circumstances, John has to leave, Pochahontas becomes Europeanized and marry's another guy. (They never said this other guy's name OR Pocahontas' name ONCE throughout the whole movie I don't think) Eventually the married couple moves to England where Pocahontas is treated like royalty. John comes to visit her, and they realize that they can never be together. She stays with her husband and son, but soon dies. The End. This whole movie was very predictable I think, and SO VERY SLOW! There were only about 3 lines of actual dialogue the rest of the movie was either in this vague sort of symbolic voice over or just represented visually like in the way she looked or he looked in their eyes. Even though Pocahontas knew English perfectly by the end of the movie you wouldn't have known it, because there was so little speaking. I was really waiting for them to start singing ""Paint with all the colors of the wind"". But it never happened. It certainly would have brought the beat up a little. This movie had absolutely zero happy/exciting/slightly upbeat parts. In order to feel the lows one must feel the joy, but this movie really did not allow us to do that. I think this movie really had the potential to tell a really awesome story, but it let me down. The movie was beautiful cinematically, the scenery was really great (I don't know how they found some of those beautiful landscapes in today's world) and the camera angels were usually pretty interesting (I had to think of something nice to say) but, I don't know anything more about Pocahontas or John Smith now than I did before. Don't rent it. It will bore you to tears. Unless you are doing a project on the subject for school it is totally not worth it.",The New World
230,TravelerThruKalpas,"Some thoughts on Malick's ""Indian Princess""",9,25 March 2006,"Some may find irony in Terrence Malick's films, but never cynicism. In the New World he hasn't fashioned his version of the events in Virginia 1607 to comply with any prescriptions derived from our zeitgeist for how such historically and ethnically sensitive material should be treated by a non-""Indian"" (the term of self-reference by tribal people, according to Scott Momaday). And, is that even possible? In practice history can never be recovered, ""correctly"" or otherwise, only remade afresh each time for present intent, in which every genuine artist indeed answers a different muse, outside consensus.The New World's storyline is so well-covered by others, that I ask the kind indulgence of readers to allow me a few points of discussion, and mostly notes at that. (Also, there may be SPOILERS.)[ Innocence ] The Indian maiden (her name unspoken) pleads for Captain Smith's life after he's captured and presented by her tribe to her father. He is freed, and despite her father's warning counsel, she is drawn into an arising bond of deep love with Smith through some causal transformation, which has occurred in him as well. They become as two children: there is smiling delight, innocent oblivion, courtesy and respect, silence. There is physical touch, yet no sexual overtones, just tenderness and a becoming shyness, as in a true(r) courtship. She is very young after all. Of this propriety Malick leaves no room for doubt.[ The Other: Singular ] Also evident and striking about their encounter is that its inherent purity is quite something which one would expect to find in such a meeting with the ""Other"" (with what is usually perceived to be completely unlike, foreign, often unwelcome or threatening); that is, when the transforming ability of that encounter is indeed enabled by openness, willingness to accept, and by inborn natural curiosity (when not typically repressed), allowing one to move forward towards that Other. In our world, ""Other"" represents difficult challenges psychologically and emotionally for many people, in coming to terms with accepting much which is foreign, culturally or otherwise. The radical liberation of this central meeting in the film might well shift perspectives for many, at the very least subconsciously.[ The Other: Plural ] Much has been made of the ""betrayal"" by Pocahontas of her people (historically), and being cast out by her father. While that occurs here, Malick's insistence on honoring the importance of individual over collective experience allows him to provide insight: not only are the Indian ""princess"" and Captain Smith able to effect their love for the Other in the singular; it will allow them to further embrace the Other in the plural, as when he intimately bonds with her kin, and when she later enlists those very kinsfolk to bring food and provisions to the English settlers, starving in midwinter. If the underlying dynamic of embracing the Other is clear, it becomes difficult to establish a convincing claim for a pure betrayal on her part. Indeed, she is shown in her continual loyalty as she returns to her father every time she has stepped out of favor while following the inner urgings of her heart, until he sends her away. Could she really choose between her community and Smith? His judgment reestablishes her humility, but it's also importantly on view when she supplicates the spirit of her dead mother who, as becomes apparent, is her true life guide, the only one we see her turning to, before and after this abandonment.[ The Individual ] For Malick there is again an opportunity to show clearly, within the individual/collective context, what is important about the maiden's position. The love for one's parents and community must be deep, yet it comes naturally, without question. However, when love for the Other arises, who can say it may not prove to be the greater, more powerful one? The one that opens, transforms, removes limitations, and matures someone ineffably, and is greater than those involved. Tragically, an opportunity for even a minimal encounter with the Other, between natives and settlers, would be impossible for a long time. However, Malick preempts any manipulation to make us register either ""poor unfortunate naturals"" or ""disgusting new colonials."" Instead he encourages empathy: to see both sides with compassion, to honor every person's suffering. The film appears primarily the story of one individual, the Indian maiden, yet while upholding the singular importance of her experience, Malick enables a deeper insight: that nations, tribes, races, people do not suffer. Only individuals suffer. ""The People,"" (that blind ideological version) never existed, only individuals exist -- sometimes unbearable to see because it is precisely at the level of the individual that one most uncompromisingly confronts the Other. [ Transcendence ] The New World is a transcendent experience, not because of its soul- glimpses (in voice-overs) or nature's endless majesty on view (although its scope, colors and sounds do manifest a different overwhelming sense of Otherness). The movement forward of Rebecca (newly named) through further abandonment by Smith, further surrender as captive Other, further encounter, courtship and marriage to Rolfe, into the blossoming of motherhood: all allow her to know new life at every stage, including her own suffering, from innocent purity and deepening spiritual reliance to the maturity of clear discernment. A last meeting with Smith, a farewell, her final certain embrace of Rolfe... what more is there to know -- for her, or for us?The new world for Smith was not Virginia, nor England for her. It is never the outer, external one. Malick offers this knowledge most intimately, his very invitation to transcendence. His art is genuine in this knowing.",The New World

232,phj-2,don't mistake lack of talent for genius,3,2 March 2006,"There's so much already said about this pretentious, self-indulgent, pompous attempt at art, that I won't elaborate too much, but will concentrate on the flaws which I can't see mentioned in previous comments. This was the most anticipated movie of the year for my part, simply because I love movies about Indians (and period pieces). On the other hand, I knew that the director was Terrence Malick, the creator of the pompous, pretentious The thin red Line. This was a movie which was very good when it was good, but oh so terrible when it was bad. Voice-over!!!! Why?? Malick; you are not unique because you apply this in your movies, there is a reason why no other directors do it!!!!! You have to let the actor ACT what he/she feels, not TELL THE AUDIENCE BY Voice-over!!The only reason I see for doing this, is that the director lacks the ability to create drama and instruct actors to express themselves convincingly to the audience, so he lets them say it out themselves: ""I'm sad. "" Who is he?"" ""who is she?"" ""what is love?"" FOR THE LOVE OFGOD!!!!!!! I wanted so much to like this movie. The cast was good, with great native actors like Agust Schellenberg, Raol Trujillo (who are great in Black Robe) Wes Studi, Michael Greyeyes, Irene Bedard (into the West). The latter is seen for 5 seconds. Jesse Borrego, who is cast as a native, is not to be seen at all!! In addition Ben Chaplin is seen for 10 seconds, rowing a boat!! Furthermore, none of the aforementioned have any dialog!! None of the characters they play are INTRODUCED BY NAME to the audience!! None of the aforementioned, plus the rest of the cast have any PERSONALITY!! The only redeeming circumstances in the movie is the nature, and costume designs of both white and Indians. But these factors only amplify the impression of the terrible, terrible waste of resources this movie is!!I will not even go into how slow and tedious the whole spectacle was. Or Colin Farell.(after all he is an innocent pawn, cast anachronistically as a pedophile, courting a 15 year old girl, who really was only 10 according to history)The ultimate proof of Malicks failure comes when Pocahontas dies in the end, tragically, 22 years old, leaving a little boy!! But how did I react? I couldn't care less!! In fact I was happy!If you want a realistic account of the fascinating drama which Malick failed to bring to screen, read ""Love and Hate in Jamestown"" by David Price. If you want to see a good depiction of the meeting and relationship of Indian and whites in early America, watch ""Black Robe"". I hope Terrence Malick never is handed a big production again, and I hope he uses more than 20 years until his next project. Then, hopefully in a filmic sense, he will be dead and gone.",The New World
233,routier,Incoherent Art,2,5 August 2006,"While I applaud the historical authenticity of the film - the situations, sets, costumes, language & cultural characterizations were excellent - I found it to be an incoherent mess which started out chaotically and by mid-film, had become very slow, completely boring & pointless.After a brief promising start (and excellent work by Christopher Plummer), the film starts jumping all over the place with no sense of time or space. If this was an attempt at conveying the chaos & uncertainty of a strange situation in a strange land, it succeeded, but it was, in my opinion, lousy storytelling. Looked like the editor was on PCP. Or something.While it was interesting to hear the native dialog in the proper tongue, after Smith learns the language and could presumably understand them, it would have been nice if we've been treated the same. Subtitling, while appropriately absent at first, should have been used more often later. Often, it was just too difficult to tell what was going on. And it's not very interesting to hear long exchanges of dialog when the actions give you no clue as to what's happening.Colin Farrell was wasted. He spent 90% of the film with one expression on his face - looking very worried. One gets the impression that director Terrence Malick said, ""look very worried, Colin"", and left it at that. In the first 30 minutes of the film, he had perhaps 8 lines of dialog. In fact, in the rest of the film, he didn't say much more.Q'Orianka Kilcher was a joy to behold, and conveyed innocence, vulnerability & childish playfulness beautifully, but how many times can you watch her gesticulating at the sun & walking through fields? Malick apparently couldn't get enough of it.The portrayal of the military actions was laughable. As a 17th century historical re-enactor, I was cheered when I saw them form up with pike & musket (if somewhat shambolically) to face the ""naturals"" outside the fort. But after presenting a wall of pikes, and sending one line of musketeers forwards to fire (with none in reserve for the second volley - which is basic stuff in this era), instead of getting the musketeers to retire & reload whilst the pikes covered the front, for some reason everyone suddenly ran forward in all directions, and got done over as they deserved to do for being so stupid. For Pete's sake! If you're going to run all over the place, it defeats the purpose of having a formation in the first place. Duh.I guess I'm not a fan of Malick's films. I thought The Thin Red Line one of the worst war (or war-setting) films I have ever seen. In that one, we had similar military nonsense - the Japanese, deadly crack shots who never miss at a distance of 2 miles, apparently cannot hit a single one of dozens of Americans running at them from 30 yards away. Maybe they weren't trained that way. When there was no shooting, everyone just whined.But back to The New World. It may be art (it's obviously intended to be, since it's not entertainment), and it's certainly a film, but it doesn't do a good job of telling a story.",The New World

Once you grasp the main idea of this one, there isn't much left but beautiful scenery and relaxing music. It's like a spa machine with the tiniest plot line thrown in. Lots of pebbles and babbling brooks, thunder, ominous skies, ominous eyebrows, and very pale, foul smelling English settlers but not much going on in or outside of the characters. The main thrust of the story being the native girls innate spirituality that eventually leads her to happiness in spite of her circumstance. Once that point is made , it's overkill. The heroine is so perfect as to be one dimensional and uninteresting. Colin Farrell is also uninteresting. There are two interesting people in this movie, Christian Bale's character and the tribal chief. I suspect the actual history told with accuracy is a lot more compelling.",The New World
235,camrammer,Pure Art.,8,30 August 2018,"Terrence Malick comes through to deliver a beautifully crafted story of John Smith and Pocahontas. With very unique divides between the environment of ""The Naturals"" as well as Jamestown, simply hearing this movie can help you envision so much about the situation the film was engaged into. The camera work provided by Malick never seems to fail to become pure eye candy on the screen. Although sometimes finding me dumfounded, this film is an experience nevertheless. In fact, the sometimes confusing situations seems to be Malick's way of conveying the experience given to John Smith and Pocahontas alike, introducing many new engagements throughout the whole film.  The movie seems to demonstrate three very separate ""New Worlds"" as given by the title. The first being the introduction of North America to the initial settlers, such as John Smith. While this is a very important aspect of the film, the world of Jamestown introduced to ""The Naturals"" shows itself to create quite a conflict within the story, causing a fully-fledged war at a point in time. However, these are not the only two ""New Worlds"" detailed within the film. When Pocahontas marries John Rolfe, she leaves with her uncle as well as many other individuals to England, in which a whole new experience is presented to her. Referring back to the sound design, there is an iconic seen in which bells can be heard and continuously become more and more overwhelming as the film progresses, telling a story within itself. To conclude, Terrence Malick comes to provide a truly amazing story that could only possibly be told in such a way by himself. The camerawork, sound design, and overall reactions and experiences displayed by the cast show a true work of art that deserves to be revered.",The New World
236,spenhask,The New World review,5,30 August 2018,"I watched this movie for my U.S History Through Film class. Now I´m reviewing for the same reason. The film was about this guy John Smith who traveled with some crew into the new world to establish a new colony. During the film he meets this girl named Pocahantus. They hang out for a couple years then John Smith leaves. Then it just shows the life of Pocahantus afterwards. I question Pocahantus being 14 in the film. I question her ever seeing John Smith after he took off. I also question the Indians being so accepting of John Smith when he came to the new world for the first time. There are no connections to any other movies I´ve seen. I like the scenery as well as the people when they actually talked. I like the time period the film takes place in. I also like to see Pocahantus develop as a person. I didn´t like how the characters rarely talked it made the film boring. In conclusion, I can see what this movie was going for but it didn´t work. It ended up being too boring. they didn´t do enough with what they had to work with. They mostly just showed off the scenery and had the characters just mumble a lot. But when they did actually communicate and got the story moving along it was good. So there you have it my review for The New World",The New World
237,donovanharris,The new world review,3,30 August 2018,"To begin, I was watching this movie to learn about the different types of ways of film making and learning about how different things were during the 1600's. This was also around the time where the English took over the Natives. The plot of this movie starts off on an island in the middle of the ocean where most Natives had stayed and lived in harmony until the English men showed and without an invitation. At first, the Natives seen the English men as a threat but then later on in the movie, both sides learn to work together. This also includes the many journeys and obstacles the English men had to go through in order to get to the island and still be able to maintain food and water. Towards the end of the movie, viewers can start to point out that the bond between the Natives and the English men starts to separate which then makes the Natives see the men as a threat to their culture and civilization. Since this movie was based on the 1600's, and 1700's age period, the special effects and the way everything is set up, it is very different than what it is like today. For example, the castles and the clothing types that people would wear is also very different along with the men style as well. Another thing to point out is that the society is living in a monarchy which means they almost always need a leader, or someone who is in control. In my opinion, there wasn't that many aspects of the historical accuracy that really needed to be pointed out. Yes, history can be rewritten but in this story everything seems to fall in place correctly based on the Disney series movie Pocahontas.",The New World

After ten minutes you realize that its the same thing you've seen before just feels and smells worse.

I had to leave during the movie just to check how much longer i would have to sustain this torture. The acting was bad. Colin Farrel acts the same way he always does. Bad.

After the first half hour, I wanted to experience the film and allowed myself the pleasure, not just watch it. I can also see where this film may not get much attention.

241,rlipton,"a tone poem, quite in consonance with Wagner's romantic music",10,18 October 2006,"I had an epiphany watching this movie, I've seen all four of Malick's movies and there is clearly a trend, there is less and less privileging of the human, particularly as being different from or above ""the world"" I've always been transfixed by his movies, the power of silence and the small gesture, Private Witt attending to the battle shaken GI at the edge of the river, simply pouring water over the crying GI, a small scene so full of grace, as were the beautiful gestures of pocahontas indicating the sky, water, wind, with her body. Then to another scene, the enveloping music, a human figure small against a large landscape, time goes slow then suddenly fast, the transposition of a wild virginia landscape with the ""captured"" gardens, ""naturals"" in each, the idea of ""the new world"" completely subverted, the terrible loss of her people, her belonging, so understated, but so powerful, the carrying on of life, and obviously death, the beginning and end of the movie are actually a circle. You can tell yourself creation stories from Malick's movies, you can cry simply from complete sadness or joy or some admixture. What drives this movie is emotion, it is the one sustained element in all his movies, while other things cinema may lapse such as plot or dialogue or narrative, the emotional tone simply builds on itself. Malick is an impressionist above all else. There are many intellectual threads that underpin this movie, whether from transcendentalism, the bible, lao tzu, etc, no one is ascendant, the point is that the artistic moment is its own entity, obviously with many influences. I would hate to have to write about movies for a living, I am seldom moved to do so, but this is different, I'm a writer who thinks Malick is introducing something completely different into the cinema, we still do not even know what it is completely (like all powerful art) , but we feel it, are affected by it, moved to some kind of response. Plot doesn't matter here, directed dialogue may or may not occur, voice overs are like the continuation of a reverie already going in my own mind, even waiting for his next movie, so long in coming, is part of the power of Malick's art.",The New World

243,harljens,Review,6,4 September 2018,I am watching this movie for a history through film class. The class is watching it together to see the differences in camera movements and different elements of Terrance Maliks filming. Arriving with the British expedition in Virginia is captain john smith. Is captured by native Americans. They spare his life because of a girl named Pocahontas. She was the daughter of the tribe chief. She had fallen in love captain john smith. John smith was sent away and his death was reported. Pocahontas went on and married John Rolfe and when john smith arrives Pocahontas is torn. For the year of the movie being filmed it was pretty advanced. Terrence Malik new how to capture things in different ways with the movements with his camera. How old Pocahontas was. I am sure there are lots of other connections to movies but i have not seen them. I do think that other directors have used Terrence Maliks movements and thought processes in there movies. I liked the movie in general. I liked the way the camera flowed with the mood of the movie. I like Terrence Maliks directing. I did not like that it wasn't 100% accurate.The movie was good. I would watch it again. I found it pretty interesting because I didn't know much about the Pocahontas story. Yes i would like to watch more movies from Terrence Malik. I like his directing.,The New World
244,hannbell,Really Enjoyed,8,3 September 2018,"I'm watching The New World because I'm taking a history through film class in school. This was one of the movies we watched together as a class. The New World is a story about Pocahontas and the settlers in Jamestown. It focuses a lot on John Smith's and John Rolfe's relationship with Pocahontas. The film follows them through when they first met and all the trials and conflicts they had to face. We watch the settlers land on the American soil and their very first interactions with the Natives, or in this film, the ""Naturals"". It shows us John Smith's journey as he lives with the Naturals and learns their ways, then it shows us all his trials once he returns and is elected the new president of Jamestown. The film displays both the settlers views and the Naturals views to the new changes of America, it helps us get a perspective of both sides, the differences and similarities and their opinions of each other. 
The filming in this movie was really high quality. The filmmaker added different angles than what we are used to but it all flowed together very well. There was a lot of great editing and very good definition and it was obvious the film was made fairly recently. There was also a quite recognizable actor, Christian Bale, who we know to be quite famous in this era. 
Most people are educated on the story of Pocahontas and we know that some of the events in this story didn't quite line up with things we've heard before. For example we know that Pocahontas never sees John Smith again once he leaves. We also know that Pocahontas is a lot younger than she is portrayed in most of the films about her. Aside from the Disney version of Pocahontas, I've never seen a film about her or about Jamestown. However, I did get to visit Virginia this last summer and on our way to Williamsburg we got to see the exact spot the settlers landed and we were able to drive through the area Pocahontas and her tribe once lived. 
A few things I really liked about this film is that John Smith wasn't portrayed by the typical blonde guy, giving him darker hair made him seem tougher and gave him an image as if he's been through a lot. The filming used while displaying the Naturals normal ways was so serene and peaceful, I really enjoyed those certain shots, especially the ones shot of Pocahontas in the fields from time to time. There wasn't a whole lot of dialog in this film I noticed, but it is still fairly easy to follow the storyline and that was something I particularly enjoyed. One thing I didn't like, however, was the way they made it seem as if Pocahontas didn't really love John Rolfe and had no desire to marry him. It seemed as if she was just marrying him to please him, this may actually be the case but I would rather have her love the man she is marrying and sharing a child with.
This film was one I really enjoyed. I love history and watching it portrayed in a way such as this film makes it even more interesting because it shows us the perspective that other people have of the story. Although I liked it, I probably would not watch it again. It was quite long and not something that would be entertaining more than once. However, I would like to watch more films made by this director, he seems to have a good taste in what people like and there was a lot of aesthetic appeal to it.",The New World
245,prestonwatt,About The New World,5,30 August 2018,"I watched this movie because of a History Through Film class. In this movie, the filmmaker is telling the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. It shows us how they met and how they went about their journey. I noticed that because this film was made in 2005, there were not much special effects. I also noticed that the technology used was not as high tech as movies are now. This movie made me question its historical accuracy because the English accent was not the same as it was in the past. Also, Pocahontas's age in the movie is portrayed to be older when in reality she was only 10. This movie reminded me of Hunger Games because of the way the filmmaker cut to scenes of nature. I liked how the filmmaker let the actors do their own thing in the movie. It makes the movie more authentic. I also liked how John Smith was Portrayed as a quiet hero because it brings a sense of mystery. One thing I didn't like was the fact John didn't fight very hard to be with Pocahontas. Overall, I think the movie is ok, but not very action packed. It was a little hard to sit through without dozing off. I would watch other movies by this director because I like the nature scenes. It was certainly an interesting movie.",The New World
246,anallars,Well executed,8,4 September 2018,"I am taking a History through Film class at school and this was the first film we watched. Terrence Malick tells the story of Pocahontas that people may be more familiar with. Although not historically accurate, it's a well-known take on the story. This film tells the story of the journey of John Smith in Jamestown and all the trials that came with it, along with Pocahontas. We get to see both sides, from the settlers with John Smith to the Natives with Pocahontas. This enabled us to see the background in the two groups interactions and how the relationship between John Smith and Pocahontas intertwined in it all. Other than Disney's 'Pocahontas' (1995), this was the only other movie I'd seen that depicts this story of Pocahontas and I did end up enjoying it. I thought the film was beautifully shot, especially the nature visuals throughout the movie. I also thought the soundtrack was great and fit the film well. It was well casted and I thoroughly enjoyed all the actors performances, especially Q'orianka Kilcher. I liked how the story extended past Jamestown and we were able to see Pocahontas' arrival with John Rolfe back to England. We got to see her in a new environment with a completely different culture and I thought Kilcher did an excellent job at showing those emotions she was feeling. One part that was probably my favorite was the final sequence. It shows the moment of Pocahontas running through the courtyard with her son with a brief narration from her, which then cut to John Rolfe's voice-over of a letter to their son stating her sudden death. Malick was able to stunningly piece together the final moments in her bed, to the moments where she was running around outside and enjoying the world around her. The score by Richard Wagner, I think, is what ties it all together. The music builds as we see the final shots before it abruptly stops and we finish with shots of nature and it's surrounding sounds. This ending reminds me of the way the more recent film 'Arrival' (2016). Both movies ended in a similar way, with an assortment of different shots and a complementary musical score of a bittersweet moment that bring the whole thing together. Although I can see how some people may not like this film, I really did enjoy it. I probably with look more into Terrence Malick's other work.",The New World

All those people who rated this film as a 10 are pompous, elitist, lier's. They want you to think that you didn't get the film but really there was nothing to get! I'm all for artsy movies but make the scenic shots breath taking and give it some historical merit. I can look at grass puddles and English country manor gardens at home! I went to Queen Elizabeths Grammar school in Alford, Lincolnshire, the same one as Captain John Smith went to, so i know a lot about his life. Pocahontas was just a 10 year old Native Indian Princess who he befriended briefly. And he was not Irish I'm sure of that!!!! This film is just drivel i was so angry that my girlfriend had made me go to watch it, i strangled her in the cinema to kill some time, the nuns were unfortunate witnesses! (its a metaphor don't worry)! Nothing happens at all, the characters don't speak just narrate their thoughts, which are dull. The imagery is just stuff you would see on a documentary about site seeing in Wales. The cinematography was muddled and confusing! AND most of all it was LONG, VERY NEEDLESSLY LONG! I feel dumber since watching The New World i think it destroyed some of my brain cells. To be fair at least 50 people walked out as soon as they realised the whole first half of the film was just going to be repeated in the second half, only set in Britain! I should have left then!!!!

248,leviticus18_32@hotmail.com,The most tedious old dross I have ever sat through...,1,3 January 2006,"since The Thin Red Line.If I was a Hollywood Exec and Terrence Malik came into my office to pitch a film to me I would have two reactions: 1). Have him thrown out by security and given a kicking in the car park (I sat through the tedious dross that is The Thin Red Line.... ) 2). Agree to his ideas and fund it and then, once I had the completed final prints in my hand, put them on a shelf in the vaults, never to see the light of day again. $100M well spent - a public service you might say! When The Thin Red Line came out, I was really looking forward to seeing it. I thought it would be great to see a war film with George Clooney and John Cusack in. George Clooney (listed 4th on the poster) does casual violence really well and I am yet to see a film with John Cusack in that I didn't like.However, what did I get? A film where John Travolta appeared for about 2 minutes at the beginning, John Cusack was good - but suddenly and without explanation vanished, George Clooney (listed 4th on the bloody poster) for 2 minutes at the end, and a tedious narration all the way through by Sean Penn (can't we make him shut up...).Oh, and (lest we forget) countless hours of sunlight. The sun in the sky. Sunlight through trees. And sunlight on water...If you enjoyed The Thin Red Line, you'll probably like this, because Terence Malik has done it again. Yes, he's taken something interesting and made it as dull as ditch water. The New World is the story of Europeans going to America and treating the indigenous people like crap. And there are countless hours of sunlight. The sun in the sky. Sunlight through trees. And sunlight on water...Because of all the shots of sunlight, this film is about 27 hours long. Well, that's how long it feels. If you were to ask how more boring it could be, the answer would be none, none more boring.If you really want to watch this film, get Disney's Pocahontas instead. It might be as historically accurate as anything a politician ever tells you about ""under the previous government..."" but it won't be nearly so tedious. And you won't have a numb bottom. Or DVT.Damn, I hated that film. Boring, boring, boring.Do yourself a favour. Gouge your eyes out with spoons so you can never watch this rubbish by mistake.",The New World

For me a big part of the beauty of the film was the screen presence and artful performance of Q'Orianka Kilcher (How do you pronounce her first name anyway?) Many here say the movie is slow. Perhaps it is. But this film is very subtle, it may not be possible to speed this up and still tell the story the same way. The movie held my attention all through. Other movies considered slow have almost bored me to insanity. In the case of this film, the performances held my interest, and the pacing was right for the story being told.Was it accurate? We only have the European's letters and notes to go by. There is no documentation from the natives who were there, obviously. History will never know Matoaka's (aka Pocahontas) real thoughts about her life. I think that would make a hell of a movie.",The New World

Compared to it, not even the costumes seemed realistic and rather actually rather ""dull"". The second mistake, was probably to expect a similar movie that is more focused onto the colonists and the colonization process itself. The movie even starts in that way and keeps the impression up for quite a while, but it ends up in being a slow love-story which centers only on Pocahontas for almost the entire second half of the movie. You really got to love long camera-shots focusing on her just walking around the set or staring at someone for minutes on end to actually begin liking the second half of the movie, not to talk about various long nature shots dubbed with the overly illustrious theme music of the movie for over 2 minutes. It had some good things about it though, especially the beginning made me wonder what it would have been like to have lived at a time like that, while having completely different things to worry about compared to today and with large parts of the world still unexplored and ""mystical"" (Here be Dragons), in which you didn't have a Google Earth at the tip of your fingers to zoom in and see any island or part of the world you want from above or being able to fly there in a matter of hours.5/10 even though it's more likely only high 4 for me personally.",The New World

I really couldn't tell what was going on for the first half of the movie, then in the second half I realized that nothing was going on so there was nothing to understand. In place of dialog between characters you get bits of narration from different characters as the viewpoint changes from one person to another. You also get long silent scenes of people thinking or holding each other. Don't wait for some strong story line to emerge that pulls you into the movies or attaches you to the characters because that never happens. The morsels of action are a mystery since there's no clear motivation behind them.On the positive side, I will admit that the sets and costumes were well done.

253,rcmoorejr,When a poet gets behind the camera,7,31 January 2006,"Ever see 'Bad Boys II'? This film is the precise opposite. A change of pace from the likes of Bruckheimer, et al., the only explosions are the firing of cannons and a few muskets. Malick films are not for everyone. Someone leaving the theater behind me said, sarcastically, 'well, that was exciting'... If you have never seen a Terence Malick film, be prepared for long, lingering shots of tree canopy, of hawks caught in flight, and minimal plot. All the touches that got Michael Cimino in trouble for 'Heaven's Gate' are the soul of a Terence Malick film. I guess the trick is to make so few films they are considered their own genre... Also be prepared for recognizable actors (John Savage, Wes Studi, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale) to play minor, even cameo roles (Jonathan Pryce is King James but with thirty seconds of screen time you'll only know this from the credits). Q'orianka Kilcher, the ingénue playing Pocahontas, represents the New World, and she gets most of the face time, beating out even Colin Farrell. The film stalls a bit when Kilcher is being trained as an English lady and goes back to England to be presented at court...but otherwise Malick succeeds in his revisionist/romantic look at Jamestown. A criticism: when Pocahontas is cast out of her tribe for helping the settlers (besides the first Thanksgiving, which is portrayed as a mercy flight, she sneaks them corn to plant), the English accept her like she's another guy in body armor and bad teeth. Being at the time one of the few females in camp, and being 'Natural', I don't believe her presence caused no ripples. Just an example of where Malick lets a popular legend overrun revisionism.",The New World

256,bambamcohee,Beautiful but boring at parts,8,30 August 2018,"For an assignment is a history through film class. So we can be introduced to Terrence Malick. Malick is telling a story about Jamestown and its settlers. Specifically the natives, Pocahontas, John Smith and John Rolfe. He tried to capture what life was like with the natives and settlers. He also showed the difficulties Pocahontas had with loving Smith and trying to balance him and her people. 
Something that gave away the time period was definitely the way of life. It was very primitive and uncivilized. Very dirty and lack of technology. The clothing was another thing because like no body where's dresses that stop you from breathing properly. 
I don't really know anything about the history of Jamestown so there wasn't anything i caught until i was told. Things like Pocahontas meeting Smith back in England Also the exaggeration of her saving Smith's life.
I haven't seen any movies based in this period of time. Therefore I can't make any connections.
How it showed the natives as friendly and playful until provoked. The expressions of the actors. It wasn't all serious, there was light heartedness.
They didnt show what happened to the settlers, yeah we know they got sick and starved but what was it like?
It was a good movie overall. It was the closest ive seen to it being the real story even with the added junk. I do want to see more movies by Malick and movies with the same actors.",The New World

258,Dargaud,Excruciating extended version,4,29 March 2010,"I don't know how much difference there is between the normal and the extended version, but having seen the latter, my comment in short is that it was simply a torture to watch.First the music was atrocious. The first 10 minutes is a continuous soup of all cords together on an organ, doing a powerful 'Vvvvvvv...' that drills into your brain. We turned the volume most of the way down until it stopped just at a time where we were getting ready to turn off the movie for good.Then the editing is very non linear. In scenes with groups of people you have quick camera changes between 5 or more viewpoints, making everything confused. Sometimes it's seen from somebody's perspective, then from above, then from the side... It's acceptable for battle scenes, but not every time there's more than 2 people on screen ! The timing is also very confused: it's daylight, then suddenly it's nighttime and then 2s later it's daylight again in a scene that is the continuity of the previous one. Hint: if you want to give the sense of passing time, don't put the same scene more than once ! The dynamics of the various situations are also very confused. They are fighting the indians, then on the next scene there are some in the camp, trading, then the situation reverts again not giving us any hint as to why things could have changed.There are so many people loitering and passing by uselessly in the background of every scene that we started laughing after a while.And the main thing that got on my nerves is the constant whispering. There are no dialogs in the movie, only quick one-liners uttered by the characters out of context in the lowest whisper possible. They add nothing to the situations, but I guess they added them because otherwise the audience would fall asleep; at least now they go ""what, what did he say?!?"". Some examples: ""A dog barks"", ""The moon shines""... There were some that were complete WTF.So far that goes for a 2/10 movie, but there are some redeeming qualities: the scenery, the indians who are realistic and interesting (even though they seem to spend most of their time waving their arms around) and the actress who can convey a lot in a few wordless facial expressions.Watch the short version, hopefully it's better.",The New World

Having said that this is the pilgrim story of the American excuse - or English excuse for transporting the desperation and greed of the old world to the new.Pocahontas is a classic legend based on true history, this film is a beautiful interpretation (although you should always consider the propaganda aspect). If you are into history you have to respect the efforts made here. It shows the old world as the corrupt but hopeful thing it was and also reflects on the corruption of the new world by that invasion.There is definitely something tragic about the whole thing 'Don't trust me' says Captain Smith and if you study history you say yeah right! On the whole it is an extremely well made film dealing with the American (Americ - guy from Wales) thanksgiving bullshit but adding the true indigestion that follows.A must see for historians and those that can suffer such bitter lessons of history.

261,chowjoe,"The ""If it's Malick, it's poetic, not lousy"" Syndrome",3,23 July 2006,"In early 1974, I saw Martin Scorcese's MEAN STREETS and Terence Malick's BADLANDS within weeks of each other at the same theater in Providence, Rhode Island, and changed my college major to film shortly thereafter. Which is my way of saying that I'm not trashing THE NEW WORLD because I know nothing about Malick or film in general. So many reviews I've seen in these pages talk about Malick only in reference to THE THIN RED LINE, which in my humble opinion is another bloated blunder that meandered more than it moved. If you actually go and rent BADLANDS (or to a lesser extent, DAYS OF HEAVEN), you will see Malick's true poeticism at work in both sound and imagery - voice-over narration that enhances story and character motivation, rich moments of stillness contrasting with jarring, eruptions of action and remarkable choices in staging and composition - all of which are absent in the new film. Instead you get mostly mumbled or whispered narration that is either barely audible or laughable when audible. (Why do actors whisper so much and so inaudibly these days? Is it lack of vocal training that ill-prepares them from projecting properly or are they so embarrassed by the lines given them that they don't want to be heard? It's definitely not my hearing because I can put on an old Orson Welles or Alfred Hitchcock flick and hear every line that's whispered, that is when those often radio-trained actors were called upon to whisper.) And the beautiful, poetic photography everyone is raving about? Only in the National Geographic or 70s shampoo commercial sense, I'd say. How many times did we need to see Pocahantas smile and back away from them camera into a field? When you can't integrate action and storytelling into your imagery, then it's just postcard pretty, as is the case here. And where's the historical authenticity people are going on about? Q'Orianka Kilcher actually shows up in her first couple of scenes wearing a buckskin bikini/halter top, for Pete's sake. Shouldn't most or all of the ""naturals"" be au naturel to begin with? Or was Mr. Artsy Malick compromising a bit for the sake of a PG-13 rating? And speaking of compromising, I agree with the reviewer who found fault with the casting of nostril-flaring Colin and smoldering Christian in the two male lead roles. That's throwing period authenticity out the window right there. (Again, if one compares this to the casting of a pre-CARRIE Sissy Spacek and the then under-exposed Martin Sheen in BADLANDS, one sees how compromised Malick's NEW WORLD vision has become.) As for Kilcher, she may have the makings of a terrific actress, but I don't think she is really old enough to portray the full psychological and emotional arc of her character. She handles the early innocence of Pocahontas well, but halfway through the film she seems to sink into the funk of a sulking child and never quite snaps out of it. And the way Malick fixates on her physicality feels less like directing to me than some kind of cinematic pedophilia. I stopped counting the number of times shots hone in her buckskinned torso in the first half and her exposed cleavage in the second half (once she is in ""civilized"" dress). I can't believe that more people aren't as disturbed by this as I was. The girl was 15 when they shot the movie! Finally, IMDb Trivia notes that over a million feet of film was exposed for this Malickian misfire. And no fewer than 4 editors are listed in the opening credits. One needs no further evidence beyond those facts that THE NEW WORLD is a self-indulgent fiasco from a former wunderkind gone senile. P.S.

263,TheMovieCritique,A new different world....,5,21 January 2006,"A consistent theme adopted by movie makers over decades has been showing the differences that exist amongst people, places, cultures, religions, or families and tug at the heart strings based on that emotion that all of us realize sadly exists, even in extreme forms, in the world we live in.The New World takes this up a notch. The discovery of an entirely new world has been depicted both in the mildness and violence that humanity shows to itself.John Smith (Farrel) is an English captain who arrives on the coast Virginia in 1607 to lay the frontier of the new world. The interaction with the 'Naturals' (or savages as they are sometimes referred to) and eventual fall of grace from their view has been well pictured. Smith falls in love with the daughter of the powerful local king - Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher in a breakthrough role) who risks her life to beg to save Smith's. But, the dream of love and the time spent in 'captivity' of the Naturals soon ends when Smith is returned to his post. His sense of duty and honor (which is all so subtly depicted - kudos to director Malick on that count!)calls over his understanding of Natives and his love for Pocahontas. Bloodshed follows.The Conquest of America, as one may call it, had a very humble beginning. The following generation would ensure that greater tracts of land were conquered along with the near destruction of an astounding culture, who had learned to be one with the senses of nature, was complete.Giving into the greater calling of duty Smith leaves Pocahontas and spurned by her people she is taken captive by the English. She rediscovers love, and eventually understands life seen through a different prism, with John Rolfe (Bale in a very sedated role).The movie managed to achieve a rare mix of (the John Smith-Pocahontas) legend and reality. Amazing concept. Real performances. It must make it one of the best movies of the year, but sadly it just doesn't. Where it falters is where director Malick has been said to have taken the most time on - editing and continuity.Most of the story and screenplay are thrown in as background (as in commentary or observations by the characters) while adopting the technique of actors show reality of the minute they are engaged in, rather than carry the story forward with their actions. While this is a very novel way of moving the story forward - one does not become attached to any of the characters because they have not 'done' anything on screen to contribute to the story. All their decisions, actions and thoughts leading to major points in the plot are kept out of the view. And this brings in a sense of slowness to the movie, despite the fact that there is a lot of story that has been told (and personally, I felt the length was right considering the volume of story told).I am an adherent admirer of filmmakers trying different ways of telling stories to the audience, but as is the case with most things in life, some forms work better than the other. Christopher Nolan (Memento) achieved it in breathtaking style, but Spielberg (War of the Worlds)- not so much. While Malick's attempt is worth applauding, it quite simply didn't make the cut for this story.6 stars/ 10.",The New World

If you like history and romance, you will probably dig it. If you fell asleep in school, you may find it boring. If you are interested in America's original inhabitants, you may find it intellectually stimulating.

268,kaessner,Poignant and transcendental,10,22 January 2006,"First, let me applaud this film. I have been waiting for Terrence Malick's fourth film ever since I saw The Thin Red Line. Arguably, Malick is one of the most adept and deliberate filmmakers right now. The New World is nearly flawless, and the beauty of Malick's direction adds to the argument that film can still be considered aesthetic. Much has been lost in the last 30 years, but Terrence Malick sticks to what he knows. What some people may complain about this movie are the long silences, the action-less movement, and the poetic voice over. This is what Malick does. He is a modern transcendentalist. What he does with film is comparable to what Emerson did in writing. The color is naturalistic, and the sounds are earthly. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots, giving the scenery more life and texture. As for the substance of the film, what isn't pantomimed in subtle gestures and movements is brought to life with flowing poetic voice over. This goes all the way back to Badlands for Malick. But here, we get varying minds contributing. There are some moments in this film when the viewer has to understand the characters by their facial expressions instead of their words. I think that will be hard for a lot of people who are expecting a more vocative and kinetic film. As for the acting, I was very impressed with all involved, particularly Q'Orianka Kilcher. This young woman played the part of innocence beautifully. I also have to give some credit to Colin Farrell, considering I never expect much out of him. Unlike some of his other movies, he was not in it to steal the spotlight. Everyone played their parts without any excessive over-acting. This movie is a historical drama, but I feel like the history aspect is merely a backdrop for the Terrence Malick play. In his production, the flowing waters and the forest canopy are the actors, and the gentle reflections of troubled minds are the words. Truly, this is an incredible film. I have waited a long time for Terrence Malick to wow me again, and he has done exactly that. If you want a movie that tears at your heart strings, then go see something recycled like Brokeback Mountain. If you want a transcendental experience, one that challenges you to go deeper than the surface of the film, then The New World is waiting.",The New World
269,chandos49,Timeless beauty surrounds the most violent change.,9,12 June 2006,"This film proceeds at a pace many viewers would find slow, but I believe the intent behind that pace conveys the AmerIndian mindset of living fully in the present, of small regard for the passage of time. Our present culture, in contrast, focuses heavily upon the immediate future and what is new. We need to adjust our expectations accordingly in order to better appreciate the amazing accomplishment of ""The New World."" This screenplay is more evocative than narrative, which works well in illustrating barriers in language, while the motives, experience and relationships we all hold dear - no matter what our circumstance or culture - shine through. Although the screenplay streamlines the story of Pocahontas, it nevertheless presents a tribute to this remarkable woman. Her life bore tremendous significance at an age in life when many of us haven't yet learned to drive. When I consider Miss Kilcher was only 14 during the filming, her achievement in this role is nothing less than astonishing.Take the time to savor and ponder this film. We're all the better for it.",The New World

Meanwhile, one could lose themselves in the sun glistened waters, the wind swept grasses, the warm rich dirt.Seriously, forget trying to enjoy dialogue or plot, you'll barely see it anyway, just put it on while cooking dinner or something, you'll easily have no idea what's going on, but suddenly want to visit Virginia.",The New World

The love story was honest as it was innocent and Q'Orianka Kilcher's portrayal as Pocahontas was brilliant for someone that slipped under my radar of rising young stars. Her character portrayal reflects the innocence of a young indigenous Indian and also the transformation into a western cultured lady. Colin Farrel and Christian Bale also added great performances. I highly recommend this film and it will definitely make its way into my personal movie collection.",The New World
272,chcolter,Washed Out and Stereotyped,3,29 January 2006,"I thought that Walt Disney's Pocahontas was bad, inaccurate and watered down. But it did have an excuse, it was a cartoon for children after all. After watching The New World in a near empty theater I discovered an entirely new realm of mental anguish and true physical pain. Instead of setting this movie in its actual time line we get eternal summer. Now we have the white Europeans who can't fend for themselves. This only makes sense in the true time line where they arrive in winter. The European genocide started the day they stepped off of the boat bringing with them syphilis and small pox. But I guess this image does not fit with the directors romantic images.Then we have the ""naturals"" frolicking in the woods being one with nature. Why this image has gained such purchase in the modern world is beyond me. Their lives were more harsh. Entire summers were spent fishing, hunting and preparing for winter survival. Pocahontas would have been too busy drying fish and gathering berry's for this much frolicking. Why aboriginal people have grasped this image and continue to perpetuate it is beyond me.After one hour of the movie, the eight people in the theater had dwindled down to only myself and my partner(who is aboriginal). Maybe we are spoiled. We live in a community where nature surrounds us. The horrible wince inducing voice overs. This movie is a Coffee Table book, all pretty pictures with no substance.",The New World
273,x2frnz,Rafel Film Center Preview 142 minutes of bliss!,10,11 January 2006,"I didn't see the version that opened on Christmas in LA + NYC. The print I saw on Sunday Jan 8, 2006 ran 142 minutes by my watch. A lot of people had to get up and use the restroom but all of them came back. I found the movie ravishing in it's deep and mysterious beauty. This is not just pictorial attractiveness (like MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA) but a splendid meditation which gives grown up people a chance to reflect on their own loves, lives, choices and gives them room to have their own feelings if they are so inclined. It's a novel experience these days when most films badger, cajole and manipulate shamelessly to less effect. This is a surprising and delicious movie FOR GROWN UPS. Of course, I wish I could see it at only private screenings and an intermission would be nice in any movie over 2 hours. These are minor considerations. I will be seeing this film several times in the theatre. I hope the audiences will be quiet! There is no bass hum to let you know when things are getting exciting and the film itself is rather quiet. p.s.As with the AWFUL ""Titanic""- Any young man smart enough to take his romantically inclined sweetheart to this film will be very lucky indeed!

The acting in this movie is superb and the fifteen year old girl who plays the lead girl does a wonderful job and it is a shame that she wasn't discovered before this movie. She, without a doubt, will have a long career in film ahead of her.

275,nickidom,History Reveiw,6,30 August 2018,Im watching this movie because it was required. and its a pretty good movie. the plot is just explaining (inaccurately) what happened with john smith and Pocahontas. this movie is also explaining how we got to america and how European organized civilization. and how Pocahontas got back to Europe. Pocahontas was actually 10 in when she met john smith. in the movie she was around 14 or 15. and it kinda showed that john smith and her had a relationship. Pocahontas from Disney has a connection. they are about the same type thing. just explained differently. John smith was way cooler than john rolph. i liked when they traded the princess for a kettle. the part where the naturals were like moneys was pretty cool too. i didnt like john rolph. the movie was pretty good. id watch it again. it was interesting for sure. the director was really good at setting up this movie. and i like the movie batman so i guess thats a automatic yes.,The New World
276,DeNo-5,Beautiful but too long,3,20 February 2007,"This movie is poetry. It is very beautiful in its images and more is shown than told. There is hardly any dialog (at least from the main characters) but some voice overs. But the story is slow. The first half is too long. It can't stay alive on beautiful images alone.The focus should have been more on Pocahontas and less on Smith, as he more or less departs from the story later on. This is Pocahonta's story.Then it is a pleasure to see a movie with this theme that does not end in a pessimistic bloodbath as most movies in this genre do. There is a fight, yes, and the natives are mistreated towards the end, but both sides show good and bad features, and definitely good intentions. There is not ""an ugly bad guy"".",The New World
277,Alieniloquium,Malick's film presents a great challenge with a greater reward,10,22 January 2006,"As an avid Malick fan, I wholeheartedly recommend all of Malick's films, including his newest, ""The New World."" I would never tell the average moviegoer that he would enjoy the film, but I hope he would at least see it.""The New World"" begins as an epic poem, with an invocation of the muse. We are immediately immersed in Malick's vision of paradise in unadulterated Virginia. The land and its people are captured beautifully by Emmanuel Lubezki's cinematography. Lubezki captures the ripples of the water with the sun's rays shining through the trees while James Horner's ethereal score completes the image of the promised land soon to be invaded by the English settlers. But Malick's film would never simplify the colonization of Virginia as an invasion by man. ""The New World"" explores man's desire for paradise and his inability to create it or obtain it.To say that the story in the film is slow is a mighty understatement. But in its defense, it never feigns to be a plot-driven film. It is entirely imagery-driven. While the love story between Pocahontas stalls at points and while there are long stretches of little to no dialog, each frame remains for a specific purpose. Not a moment of the 150 minute runtime is wasted. The story itself takes a back seat to the images presented and they complete the love story. Farrell and newcomer Kilcher convey the love between their characters as immaculate and beautiful. Malick instills what could be a dubious relationship with the notion that this love is not between a man and a woman, but between humanity and the peace which it desires most.The peaceful cinematography and the love story both abruptly end when the socially accepted version of the Smith-Pocahontas fable halts and her real story continues. There is a subtle shift in the way this portion of the film is shot. There is no more beauty to the land, the film, or to Pocahontas, for that matter. The film seems as awkward as Pocahontas does in her English dress. The colonists have stayed in Jamestown, attempting to live in paradise without adhering to its terms. Soon, Pocahontas marries Rolfe and Rolfe takes her to England. Malick continues to film without his usual style as he shows England without the warm tones of Virginia. But again, Malick's film would never simplify Virginia and England with a good-bad dichotomy.England is man's attempt to create its own paradise. Malick shoots London and the surrounding countryside's beauty with a style different from that which he shoots Virginia. England is entirely geometrical. The trees are groomed into perfect cones and the rectangular buildings tower in their own unnatural beauty. Shown in stark comparison is the lone Powhatan among the trimmed grass and gardens who has come with Pocahontas to experience man's attempt at paradise for himself.We are finally given reprieve from the awkward cinematography when Pocahontas achieves her happiness with Rolfe. The love story ends tragically yet happily and Malick's camera follows her happiness with one final vision of peace and beauty. The closing shots are stunning beyond words and would leave even the most skeptical of film-goers absolutely breathless.",The New World
278,internut02,Beautifully filmed but terribly flawed....,10,6 June 2006,"Probably one of the most irritating film scores I have ever heard. One chord continuous(almost sounded like looping) on and on...like sitting at railroad crossing waiting on the train to pass while your hearing the monotonous rhythm of the train.The acting was passable, but the dialog was sometimes untenable, as most of it was the thoughts of the characters and not actually spoken. Direction and scene cuts were disjointed, and the viewer is easily confused. There are a few scenes where there is a tight shot on the character, the viewer thinks that by this expressive shot they will gain a little more insight on the characters emotions, then BAM! cut to black! If this is film art by the best, let me see some amateur stuff. The story just doesn't flow. Terrible waste on a good story.",The New World
279,la-31,Beauty of Spirit and Nature,7,1 February 2006,"This film, if taken on the level(s) of what it sets out to portray, is gorgeous and simply without equal. It has its flaws, but it's a film that ought to be judged by the vision which drives it. On the aesthetic level, one can hardly find flaw with it. Malick is brilliant in that he incorporates elements which mainstream Hollywood has trained itself and its unthinking audiences to avoid and/or have no taste for : long, drawn-out scenes of nature, many times of simple stillness or limited ""action""; actors using their bodies and faces rather than the spoken word ; soundtrack-musicless scenes which transport the viewer into that place and time... There are countless other examples to be sure. This was the first film by Terrence Malick that I've seen, and I loved this style. There will be some who will not enjoy it, so be warned. I, however, was prepared for it, having read about the film and Malick's style beforehand. I had moderate expectations of this film, going in, and they were completely surpassed.Malick is also walking an interesting line between myth and reality in this film. It's a unique combination which I've not seen before. Although the film has elements which are more realistic than in other portrayals of the Pocahontas story, the film's story, in the end, recounts the known 'legend' version. So people will potentially find 'holes' in that aspect of the film. I am not altogether familiar with the most historically accurate chain of events, but I found the reverential treatment of Pocahontas by the white settlers a bit extreme. Especially since she was the only female for quite some time in the colony, and was surrounded by a bunch of desperate, half-starved men.However, it's important to note the themes which really drive this film, which I am assuming, are Malick's vision : the almost spiritual beauty of the untouched wilderness of Virginia ; the similar purity of the Native tribes, so fittingly referred a few times as ""naturals,"" and the vile intrusion on all this by the white colonization. I believe the portrayal of the English colonists and the elements they brought with them is as close to reality as I've ever seen in a film. They were shown as not necessarily intending evil (well, at least not all the time!), just doing things as they thought fit, without regard to anything else. Malick still doesn't excuse the evil outcome of all this, and is simply contrasting the two societies. And what a stark contrast! I'm not Native American, but to me, the film portrayed the tribes with a post-modern perspective of admiration, almost envy, and the fascination of an outsider. And clearly from a point of sympathy. In the end, one can never escape the fact that people lived on this land, and strangers from afar came with expectations of usurping it. Simple as that. If one reverses the roles, ie, whites in their native land contending with strangers from afar, one can get an idea of that sympathy. At least, that's how I always imagine it, and I never understand people who feel defensive and try to justify colonialism. There is justification for respect for another in their land, and mutual trade and co-existence. There is no justification for hostility, stealing land and genocide.All of the actors in this film were outstanding. I think all the Native American actors deserve recognition for their amazing transformations. The way they moved, looked, stood, crouched, etc. It was phenomenal to watch. In all the scenes involving the tribe, I was just riveted, in awe. In all honesty, I felt the amazement, curiosity, fascination, and trepidation which those early colonists probably felt. This is probably a result of the whole style, but the Native actors deserve praise for this.The three main actors, Q'orianka Kilcher, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, were excellent. Kilcher was completely believable in her portrayal of the instinctual teenaged Pocahontas. She was natural in the role, though she is so young. Between Farrell and Bale, I had much higher expectations of the latter, and he didn't disappoint. He was just amazing. Bale's John Rolfe has much less screen time, and less dialogue but he was able to capture and convey the conflict and past of the character effectively. I have to admit that I am a prior fan of Bale, but Colin Farrell is the one whom I'd vote 'most improved.' His portrayal of John Smith is surprisingly nuanced, complex and rather subdued, the latter in keeping with the whole theme of the film. I think it's quite a feat for Colin Farrell, who really should be proud of his performance. I was going to make a comment about his Irish accent, which he makes no effort to disguise, but since Malick didn't have a problem with it, who am I? :) But truly, I think this has to be one of Christian Bale's best performances, though I haven't seen all his films (just three others). Part of the reason why I enjoyed his performance, and the others, is that I had read that Malick was asking the actors to ad-lib a lot. So I watched for this, and actually noted such a naturalness in many scenes, that I thought they HAD to be ad-libbed! My own favorite is when Pocahontas falls down, and she and John Rolfe dissolve into laughter. That seemed completely genuine / unscripted. It was a very sweet moment to leave in an otherwise awe-inspiring film.If there is one complaint that I have, it's that I find the love story/triangle rather trite, but then again it has its roots in history, and that's not really a criticism of the cast or director or the others who performed their jobs beautifully on this film.",The New World
280,cynsk8,Poetic and Impressionistic,8,23 January 2006,"The New World Critics were split on the merits of this movie. As of this posting, the movie managed to garner a 54 on Rotten Tomatoes.com. Few people however, seemed to appreciate the poetic essence and impressionistic nature of this film and instead considered it dull and uninteresting.If your a fan of epic historical tales with sweeping sequences of action and intrigue, then this film may disappoint. It is much more an exercise in somber reflection and tacit emotion. Nature and the beauty of an unspoiled land are placed in the forefront, whereas the colonist invaders are held at somewhat of a distance. Pocahantas is decidedly the only character with color and life. If you are a fan of Colin Farrell or Christian Bale, this movie is also for you-they both were beautiful.",The New World

282,scootser-1,Cinematic Poetry,10,18 January 2007,"Terrence Malick, the director of The New World, is known for not rushing his projects and concentrating on the quality and the details. As a result he has directed only four motion pictures over his 30-year career but each one of them has with time gathered a loyal and strong following.Starring Colin Farrell (Phone Booth, Alexander), Christian Bale (Equilibrium) and the young actress Q'Orianka Kilcher, The New World tells the well-known story of Pocahontas. British settlers arrive in Virginia to establish a colony called Jamestown. Relatively soon they run into troubles with their food supplies and the natives and decide to send Captain Smith to a nearby village to try to negotiate a trade agreement. While in the village Smith and the youngest daughter of the chief, Pocahontas, fall in love despite the chief's caveat. Soon after Smith's return to Jamestown, he is sent on a faraway mission, leaving Pocahontas alone. After a while John Rolfe arrives and also falls in love with her. In the end Q'Orianka, as well as the viewer, is torn between the loves of these two equally respectable men.Everything about The New World is extraordinary. One can see that it was filmed with great passion, dedication and pure artistic interest. The direction of the movie is not completely clear and unambiguous. Some short parts of the otherwise continuous script are skipped and replaced with genuinely alluring shots of nature. The actors' first-rate performances reinforced with the aesthetic direction, careful editing and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Y Tu Mamá También) truly bring the characters to life and you feel their emotions as well as your own. Parts of the film are narrated by the three leads. The narration differs from conventional in such that it does not work as a plot device but rather comprises deep and profound dictums describing the characters' emotional state. One of the greatest technical achievements of this film is that contrary to other films, in which the music is edited to fit the scenes, the music was mixed first and then the scenes were cut to fit the score. The soundtrack is mostly classical music including the ingenious ""Das Rheingold"" by Richard Wagner. The scenery is mostly pure untouched nature but they also built a copy of Jamestown, canoes, natives' shacks and a lot of other props; all real and out of authentic material. This goes to show just how much affection and love was put into The New World.Audiences and critics are much divided by this film. This is most likely because The New World requires a lot of attention and if you are not used to sitting in a chair staring intensely at the screen for more than two hours you will not get much out of it. The New World may have not received the Academy Award it deserved nor was it a big hit at the box office but everyone involved in making of this film should be proud for they have proved that motion pictures can be art too.",The New World
283,stevegoralczyk,Well...,8,5 June 2015,"Okay, let me start off by saying that I think Colin Farrell is one the WORST actors out there, and has ruined a lot of potentially good movies because of that. The only reason I gave this film an 8 is because of him and his awful acting.Beyond that, I cannot see why anyone could really hate this movie! Sure, it's not a settlers vs natives shootout action flick, but is that what we've all come to expect as movie goers in the 21st century? There are many other elements in his movie that make it great besides the action.People complain about the narration reflecting the lack of screen writing ability, but i think it's perfect for a film like this, exploring inside the mind of someone who is just exploring this new place at that point in history. A lot of the complaints I've read about this movie are unwarranted, unless you blame Colin Farrell :)",The New World
284,SpencerDoingReveiws,It is a solid movie,7,30 August 2018,"The New World is a 2005 directed by Terrence Malick. It is a romance, action, movie about the colonization of Jamestown in Virginian in 1607. This movie depicts the story of Pocahontas and john smith with other historical figures and how Pocahontas save his life and how the nature of the new world and its peacefulness of the native Indians having their traditions and how they lived their lives.The movie is very slow but not unwatchable like other people will like to make a review on this movie as this movie is very artistically based on the nature of the new world and it has different camera shots depending where the base location as the shooting of the camera is different in the colony and England than it is in the forest of the native Indians hamlet as they live and survive in the nature.The movie is a nice relaxing movie but it is not for everyone the movie is very slow and run on for some part but that hardly makes it a bad movie it is a solid movie in every regard And the relationship between Pocahontas and john smith make it a romance movie but it is a solid movie but it's not for everyone.",The New World

The way the director moved the camera in different angles and different points of perspective was nice. I also liked that the director chose to alter the sounds of the world wherever they were, like when john smith was with the natives and all you could hear was nature and peaceful noises and with the colony all you hear is work and death. What i didn't like about the movie is that the characters don't really interact with each other and its mostly them saying a few words or nothing at all. . I have never seen that movie before but it was very similar other movies including Pocahontas and John Smith. Overall i liked the movie because it was an interesting story.",The New World

And in that, The New World proved to be no different than his other works.For me, the first part of the story was shot in the best way posible, allowing us as audience to feel immerse in every shot, the camera work manages to let us feel included in the characters' points of view. Lubezki showed us the level of craftsmanship he has in himself. Q'orianka Kilcher achieved an engaging and powerful portrayal, now I cannot imagine this film without her. Lastly, the use of music was exquisite as well.Basically, the only issue I have is not with the film itself, but with the source material, I cannot trust the conquistadores' point of view to be accurate and as tender in real life, but we'll never know, but for me is just common sense, colonialism was never respectful, nor gentle, nor even thoughtful in its approach.",The New World

288,not_the_real_george,A visual poem,8,8 March 2012,"One of the advantages of Malick's films is that they allow a lot of(personal) interpretation of the main theme. One theme is for certain the purity and simplicity of the ""naturals"" compared to the modern world. The conquering of the new world comes in a subtler way here through the character ""Pocahontas"" , so they don't have a final battle as you see in every film, because it isn't necessary. Her new clothes which don't suit her, and those artificial trees at the ending(remember the Indian's look) all lead to a sort of defeat. No battle is needed- no major battle was fought.Some may not agree on my love story interpretation- but I believe maybe there was a defeat ""inside her"" also. Her first love was spontaneous, simple and in the end she accepts(she truly accepts, without sad feelings) John. She enters the modern world completely. The monologue voices are very Malick like, very similar with The Tree of Life, and so is the camera movement. I saw many people complaining about the editing, but it was supposed to be like this. I guess it doesn't want to be like the continuity of a story, but rather details in a large world where you're just the observer.Very good, another visual poem !",The New World

Part of it may have been the unfortunate choice of Colin Farrell to play Capt. Smith (this boy cannot carry a film) but part of it also was the ultra-slow pacing and the complete lack of an interesting plot or any real dramatic tension in the action. We had plenty of pretty pictures to look at but it's just not enough. I was hoping for a historical romance like ""Days of Heaven,"" but TNW lacks everything the other has-- story, great performances, engaging characters, drama-- except the gorgeous photography.

291,ynqve,Beautiful but deeply flawed,6,17 October 2012,"I had been warned that this film was a snoozefest, but I just thought that's because people nowadays are so used to loud action movies from directors like Michael Bay that they have a problem with any slow paced narrative. But this movie is not slow, because that would require some movement. It is just standing still most of the time, which is a shame because it could have been so good! Don't get me wrong, there are some great aspects to the film, visually it's a stunner! The cinematography is really really good, there are so many beautiful shots and scenes. But when it comes to plot and narrative something is deeply wrong. I think you could have cut out at least an hour without disturbing the plot at all. It is too long! And just because you have nice nature shots with a voice-over that says something like ""mother, you are everywhere"" once every minute doesn't make it deep. It just make the film boring. Also I would have preferred less focus on the relationship between Pocahontas and Smith (which consists of them staring at each other with ""deep"" voice overs), and instead have more focus on the relationship between the settlers and natives. However, I think that the part with Christian Bale is a lot better and far more interesting. Sadly most viewers won't see it because they are probably sleeping by then. I think they could have shown more of Pocahontas in London, the clash of cultures is an interesting subject. Lastly, I saw the extended cut, avoid it like plague. It doesn't add anything interesting, it just make the film even longer.",The New World
292,professorskridlov,Appallingly misjudged,2,22 March 2016,"Terrence Malik is a very strange director. That statement can be taken two ways, both of them applicable to this clunky effort. From the start the film utilises similar techniques and ideas found in ""The Thin Red Line"" - in fact ever since ""Badlands"". We hear the thoughts of characters as they reflect on the paradoxes of life'n'lurve'n'conflict. There's a lot of Noble Savage guff going on here and more than a hint of ""Last of the Mohicans"" - not in a Good Way. I'm reluctant to call any of his movies pretentious because at his best no director manages better to incorporate into his films profound ideas about what it is to be a human being. The Thin Red Line is something of a masterpiece in this respect. It amazes me that he can have so misjudged the pace of the film. All that said the young lead actress is quite magnificent in the role, almost - almost - making it worth enduring the excruciating longueurs which drag the film down over and over again. There are some irritatingly implausible quirks about the way the dialogue is handled too. The perennially difficult issue of how to deal with two languages where neither group can speak or understand the other is incompetently executed. ""Slow"" in itself seldom bothers me if the content works, but this is a really tedious clunker. I lost interest just over 90 minutes in.",The New World
293,cptnhook13,Best sleep I've had in weeks,1,18 June 2006,"Quite possibly the most boring ""epic"" ever envisioned; If you like no dialog, lots of trees, swirling random cameras, trees, grass, silence, and trees, this is the movie for you. It's a mind-numbing 2+ hours that you'll never get back. You might actually hate yourself.I'm sure the actual story of John Smith and the Native American girl (never called by her name) is somewhat interesting. This version is not. In fact, it's awful. When I could no longer take it, I killed the DVD and lo an behold - I found 'Under Siege' on the Encore Action channel (for the 47th time this month).

294,bantouman,The New World of Cinematic Tedium,5,24 January 2006,"Acclaimed Director Terrence Malick comes out of hibernation to concoct this moribund outlook on the legend of Pocahontas. The year is 1607, and King James envoys set foot on the rustic shores of Virginia, intent on building the first European Colony in America. They encounter the Powhatan Indians, but no epic battle ensues. Terrence Malick focuses his energy on the romantic bond between authority challenged sailor John Smith ( Colin Farrell ), and the Powhatan princess Pocahontas ( Q'Orianka Kilcher ). I haven't watched a movie this slow paced since Moby Dick was Tuna. Scenes of affection between Smith and Pocahontas are repetitious, and indeed the order of the day. The accompanying monologues in voice-overs complete the moviegoer's zombification process in an ""EYES WIDE SHUT"" sort of way. I did manage to refrain from exploding in an outcry of "" WHAT'S NEXT ? "". What's next is more of the same, with settler John Rolfe ( Christian Bale ) vying for Pocahontas' heart, following Smith's departure from the settlement. A reprieve from the doldrums is granted in the form of sporadic attacks by the indians, but this is not sustained. You see, war is not an angle of this historical saga Malick wishes to contemplate, and that's really a shame. Wes Studi, known for his compelling Indian Warrior performances in ""Dances with Wolves"", and ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is only here to adorn the Virginia wilderness. He might as well have been building sand castles at nearby Chesapeake Bay. I hope his star rating doesn't drop like a cliff-diver in Acapulco. Malick compensates for an obvious lack of variety in his material by prolonging scenes of Pocahontas' playful disposition to kingdom come, slowing the pace of the movie to a nightmarish crawl. The Cinematography is eye catching, and the symphonic score is somewhat enjoyable. The acting by the main actors is commendable ( Kudos to Kilcher for a respectable debut ), but this is a rather boring flick destined for the DVD shelves in double quick time. The storyline is painfully mono-directional, and I just couldn't keep myself interested for 2.5 hours. I could be standing on the buffet line for crow two months from now, but I don't anticipate huge Box Office receipts for this tortoise of a movie.",The New World
295,E_D_N,Superb. I recommend it... but with some reservations...,9,11 December 2005,"... it's very much a TERRENCE MALICK movie, and by this, I mean, not the Malick of BADLANDS, but the Malick of DAYS OF HEAVEN and THE THIN RED LINE, i.e., Malick at his most naturalist and contemplative.THE THIN RED LINE esp., has much in common with THE NEW WORLD. We see the Natives inhabiting a sort of primeval earthly paradise, a place filled with joy and innocence but pregnant with foreboding: the inkling that somewhere, somehow soon, paradise will be lost.And lost it is.From the first glimpse of the sailing ships, the atmosphere of supreme beatitude that permeates the Native enclave is tarnished. Fear, curiosity, and ambivalance draw both settlers and Natives toward each other.Perhaps, some will fault Malick for depicting a Native world seemingly free of internecine conflict. It looks much too innocent and most inhabitants are too carefree. That some will shrug it off as yet another instance of ""noble savages"" being by the evil white man is inevitable. I say to them, give Malick more credit. In my humble opinion, he proves to be even balanced in his depiction of both sides. There are a couple of caricature-ish soldiers among the newcomers, but on the whole, these are just a bunch of tired and hungry seafarers content to reach what they believe to be a safe haven -- no cartoonish, bloodthirsty white man.It's a strange and new experience for everyone and the first contact between them is surprisingly gentle, a process of mutual self-discovery -- that is, until the hostilities begin...Beauty applies to the film in many respects. The images and the colors are breathtaking. Malick more often than not uses a hand-held camera and shoots in tight compositions, close to the faces, in order to better grasp the expressions on the faces upon first contact.As could be expected, the gorgeous images of nature succeed themselves for most of the 150min running time, and that, apparently was a problem for many, as quite a few people walked out during the screening. I for one applaud Malick's approach and could not conceive of such movie without the contemplative shots. Wide commercial appeal seems limited, however.Anyways, I like that he uses spare dialogue with only minimal subtitles, to further emphasize the initial problems of communication.The battle sequences are swift and superbly edited for maximum impact. However, one thing I found strange is the lack of blood. I looked hard, but couldn't spot any blood flowing -- not very realistic given the otherwise VERY naturalistic approach.The problem with the script might be its lack of focus. There are three POVs throughout: SMITH's, POCAHONTAS's, and JOHN ROLFE's (each with V.O. narration) and though the story pretty much starts where one expects it, it does meander for stretches on end.As far as the acting is concerned: Kilcher is quite a find. She's perfect for the role. I've read some of the reviews by some critics who complained that she may not be the most ""trained"" of actresses and I think it's an erroneous comment, for Pocahontas here is presented as the fleeting object of two men's desire and a elfin spirit of nature, fleeting through the tall grass, dreamy and the girl has such natural radiance that her standing there is enough. Her performance is organic, natural, perfect. She doesn't ""act"", she is, and that's wonderful. She has a marvelous face and holds the camera and us, the audience in rapt attention.Colin is excellent as well. However, the role as written doesn't give him much leeway. He's basically in brooding mode and does it well, it's just that his character remains a bit of a cipher throughout. Still, he does make a solid SMITH even though I couldn't help thinking that maybe Christian BALE should have played the lead.BALE's JOHN ROLFE appears late in the movie, and it's to his credit that he completely eclipses FARRELL. It might just be that his character is better fleshed out and is easier to empathize with. In retrospect, the casting is good as it is, because I'm not sure FARRELL could have given such a sympathetic reading of ROLFE's character.I have been waiting for this movie since it was first announced that Malick would be at the helm and I'm not disappointed -- but then, I've been a Malick fan since BADLANDS. I recommend it to all, but many, I'm sure, won't like it.",The New World
296,the_extremist,"If this movie were any slower, it would just be a photograph.",1,19 February 2006,"To sum up this movie:30% of it, is badly scripted voice-over monologues. 15% random shots of nature. over and over again. 10% close-ups of peoples bodies. 5% badly choreographed fight scenes. 5% unintelligible babbling. 10% of it I didn't pay much attention to because I may have been asleep, but its OK because they were still showing the same thing when I woke up.I hope this isn't considered a spoiler, because while I haven't given away the so-called plot, I think I have just about covered the whole movie. Its just the same stuff repeated over and over, in a random and disconnected fashion, drilling it into you like the director is insulting your intelligence.

297,sdsmith5141,very good movie,8,23 January 2006,"This movie was different than what I thought. There was a lot more romance than what I expected. I expected for it to be mainly about the struggles and politics between the settlers and Indians with the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas as a supporting plot. It started out that way but then the romance part basically took over. It seemed slow moving, but it was a wonderfully acted movie which is the reason why I gave it an eight out of ten score. The ending was rather abrupt and really needs to be redone, but I enjoyed it. The acting that really locked me in and grabbed my attention was the acting on the part of the indians - especially Pocohantis. She and the other indians really captured the essence of the native American Indians. Their emotions, form of humor, entertainment, politics, and temperament was very well portrayed by the cast - especially Pocohantis. The biography on her shows she is only fifteen. If this is accurate then she has a very bright future ahead of her. I will be disappointed if she doesn't win an award. Best acting performance I have seen since Denzel Washington in Training Day. I know they are two completely different roles, but Washington did a great job of portraying a corrupt cop just the same was as Kilcher portrayed Pocohantis.",The New World
298,johnraut-58334,Almost historically accurate.,6,30 August 2018,"I am watching this movie for a history through film class. We are watching it to see how historically accurate films are.The filmmaker is trying to tell the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. The movie surrounds their relationship and how it caused war and forgiveness between the settlers and the naturals. When the settlers first come into contact with the naturals there is much confusion. A small war starts when John Smith takes Pocahontas to Jamestown and is accused with ""stealing"" their princess.The way the English settlers dressed and the way they built Jamestown shows the time period the story takes place in. They build their walls around Jamestown out of raw uncut wood. The naturals also show how long ago this was. They live in huts made of wood and leaves. Their technology is very behind because they use fires inside of their homes for warmth.This movie made me question it's historical accuracy because every story of Pocahontas is different and no one really knows the true story. I'm not sure that John Smith would have been able to teach Pocahontas English that easily. I also don't think that many naturals would have been taken to England with them.I did not notice any connections to other movies in the film. The only thing i noticed was that their love story was similar to the Disney cartoon version.Three things i liked about the movie was the camera work, the setting, and the accuracy of their clothes. The camera work was very beautiful because it was very smooth and flowing. The setting the movie was shot in was very beautiful. There was lots of trees and water. The clothes they wore were very accurate to the time period.",The New World

Leaving the moviegoer more focused on how uncomfortable the seating is than what might be happening on the screen. To make matters worse we are constantly bombarded with the same few bars of Mozarts piano concerto no. 23--over and over and over until even the purest classical music buff cries ""enough!"" The secret might be to burn a fattie before going. Pot smokers will undoubtedly dig the films dreaminess and groovy vibe, but for those of us whose minds are mostly addled by the constant dirge of sobriety the length and lack of direction of this film will be a constant effrontery.Oh, by the way. Why is it that Hollywood thinks we won't sympathize properly with Indians unless they are made to look like unusually tan Nordic Gym models.I felt like I was watching a commercial for Victoria Secret's new Buckskin Editions. Historical photos from the 1800's just don't seem to support evidence of particularly Athenian statures or the presence of Revlon products in Americas original native peoples.

The New World is maddeningly, excruciating slow, with way too many long, thoughtful musings. The director seems to have watched too many Ingmar Bergman movies. The New World was as boring, long, incomprehensible and ponderous as five Ingmar Bergman movies and Wagner's Ring opera combined. A good third of the dialog was unintelligible. There were many beautiful scenes, but many of the water scenes were numbingly repetitive. How many times do we have to watch the main characters staring wistfully out at the water? The casting was great, but generally wasted on this ridiculous movie. On a positive note, the depiction of the squalor and suffering seemed very realistic. No expense appears to have been spared on creating the authentic costumes and sets. And on a final note, the depiction of the beginning of the white man's ultimately tragic mistreatment of the native American Indians added a sad note to the movie.",The New World
304,johnnyzed,Y-a-w-n-n-n,5,20 January 2006,"If you want a REAL soporific movie, go see Terrence Malick's latest. He has this obsession with photographing water and sky, preferably against the sunlight, so the color is washed out, i.e. bad Technicolor. He's also got the cliché beloved by arty cinematographers: the gigantic moon, bigger than you or I will ever see it, unless we launch into outer space . Whether it's Guadacanal or ole' Virginy, Malick lets his camera drift on and on. He must figure he's creating a significant pastorale reading of history, but in effect it's plain boring. It would help us viewers if the dialog were louder than the musical track. I suspect that Malick distrusts speech and would feel more comfortable making silents. The music track borrow shamelessly from Wagner's Rhine music from his ""Ring"". Appropriately, it never resolves itself into exciting drama the way Wagner wrote it.",The New World

Either way, this film is an utter achievement on the highest level. When other film-makers are giving us two-dimensional cartoon characters parading as deep psychological insights, Malick gives us pure poetry and majesty - a trip into the past and way beyond. Apart from being a unique experience, this film is beautifully shot, beautifully written, extremely intelligent, sensitively scored, powerful with performances beyond anything we have seen this year in cinema. It is, quite simply, mesmerising.Malick has admirably steered clear of a torrent of pointless, immature dialogue in favour of a harshly realistic and yet poetically transcendent film created virtually entirely from image, sound, music, gesture. What is said is only what needs to be said. Again, a refreshing change from the dribbling verbal diarrhoea exhibited in so many other films.Q'Orianka Kilcher in the lead role is an absolute revelation. What a magical, deeply-felt performance from a talented young lady who surely promises to be one of the great actresses of her generation. An emotional, utterly beguiling characterisation in a film so admirably conceived and so intelligently executed.",The New World
306,funzo333,A new view of the old world,9,17 November 2008,"In his fourth film, Terrence Malick once again takes poetic liberty in delivering us a story which  like his previous three films, Badlands, Days of Heaven, and The Thin Red Line  causes us to ponder our own existence and current state of mind. The New World brings us on a beautiful journey from the first landing of the English in Virginia, to the current Powhotan Indian settlements, and all the way back to England. Each place is a new world of its own kind. In this film, we do not get another revisionist take of history, but rather an exploration into nature, innocence, and modern culture. Emmanuel Lubezki beautifully crafts every shot with purely natural lighting to truly bring us back to the age of Eden in America. The New World is a film that's meant to be felt and understood.After some voyeuristically tranquil establishing shots of the still untouched nature in America, the movie opens with John Smith (Colin Farrel) and 100 other Brits landing on the beaches of America. They are looking for gold, but end up staying and setting up Jamestown as the ships head to back to England for more supplies. In a searching expedition, John Smith gets captured by the Powhatans already living there, and seconds before he is to be killed, the young Pocahontas (Q'orianka Kilcher) throws herself on him and begs to have his life spared. We see here both the beauty and the fatality of the innocence of the natives, or 'naturals' as they are called in the film. Just as in the first contact scene, they are very wary of the invading Brits, but ignorant to the corruption and greed that they bring with them, and the ultimate fate that they face. In a showing of mercy that will ultimately add a nail to their own coffins, they spare Smith's life, and allow him to live with Pocahontas in order for them to learn each others languages and learn from each other. Smith and Pocahontas bond, and become as one in the following months. There is very little dialogue, but many monologues, streams of consciousness, and a melding of energies. She represents nature, and purity, and innocence. And he represents someone who never even knew these things, but is learning. They are not two lovers as we think of lovers today, but rather two energies, flowing seamlessly together with each other and the earth. Through cinematography that makes us believe in the purity and spirituality of nature again, and the lack of dialogue, we as viewers really connect with who the Native Americans are and what they represented. Malick presents us with a counter-argument to the revisionist history that we hear so often.Through Pocahontas' transformation, we embody the feelings that Malick is representing in the film. Smith ends up heading back to England, and leaves Pocahontas all alone and thinking he is dead. She is left in the dystopia that is early Jamestown; trapped as a bargaining chip to prevent them from being attacked by the naturals again. In the settlement, she lives in the mud, with little food, and wearing traditional English clothes that not only seem ridiculous, but sad because they work to cover her and prevent her connection with nature. She says her favorite thing is grass, yet, she can't even walk or move, much less frolic and feel the tall grasses like she used to because of her new clothes and lifestyle. She ends up marrying and having a child with a new English settler named John Rolfe (Christian Bale). She consents to him because her feeling of loss  not just from Smith, but from nature, her old way of life, and her tribe  overtakes her and numbs her. The English have cut down all the trees within a half a mile of their settlement, so that they might build large walls, watch towers, and a large Christian cross. Their presence becomes too big for the naturals to drive off, and they begin the wheels of history in conquering the entire new world with lack of respect or understanding of what was there first. Eventually, Pocahontas returns to England with a crew to meet the king and queen, and once again we are thrust into a new world. The geometry, lines, and order of everything we see is almost sickening. The bushes are all sculpted perfectly, the grass is all shaved down, and the buildings are all elegant and massive. Pocahontas and the other naturals who came along on the trip barely even know what they're looking at. Modern man does not embrace nature and beauty, but rather tries to control it and redefine it. Nature is beautiful because is it pure chaos at its core, yet it works in perfect harmony. When we try to order it, define it, cut it down, and rebuild it in our own imperfect image of what true beauty is, we lose something undefinable. When Pocahontas dies at the end, we feel a sense of bittersweet happiness. Pocahontas has lost most of who she was through her journey to her new world, and we see this as the future for all the naturals. This is a film that does not take patience as long as you know that you are going to a jazz show, and not a rock concert. It is beautifully crafted and thought provoking, but it does not dangle a twinkie in front of your face, but begs us for conversation. You must realize that Malick doesn't necessarily want people to think a certain thought, he just wants them to think. And if the heartfelt cinematography and Malick's unique directing can help you grasp onto the paradise and the connection with nature lost in this film, you will have found a piece of art that has the potential to change your whole frame of mind",The New World
307,marika_alexandrou,A feast for the senses,10,26 February 2006,"I finally saw ""The New World"" yesterday. It was quite an experience.This film is miles away from any other that I've ever seen before. It's a feast for the senses. Senses are the key to this movie. You either let them guide you or you've missed the whole point. I cannot blame anyone who has complained about how slow, boring or even irritating this picture was. This is not the kind of movie that can be appreciated by intelligent reading. Neither does it belong to the category of highbrow artistic films that aim to an intellectual elite of an audience and shut out the rest of us, poor lesser mortals. You don't have to ""understand"" this film, you have to ""feel"" it. Just open up your heart and let the emotions carry you away and elevate you. The plot is simple and far from original. Adam and Eve, paradise lost, human greed and personal ambition coming face to face with the beauty of nature and the joy of pure living. Clash between illusion and reality, dream and fact. The originality of this film lies in the way that these themes are depicted. Muted glances, forbidden touches, light and darkness mingle with the murmur of the river and the rustle of the wind  the breath of mother nature. Dialogs are scarce. Mainly voice overs run through the whole picture. I found them neither irritating nor useless. They are uttered in the form of inner thoughts, secret longings, muted prayers and they add to the dreamlike effect of this movie. Acting was actually very good. That was an extra bonus for a film like this, where actors are meant more to help the story and the images unfold, than astound us with their memorable performances. The actors' success in this movie lies in their ability to express their feelings through minor gestures, glances and body language. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a magnificent creature that embodies the essence of nature and beauty. She bends, she submits to the inevitability of assimilation but she never loses her freedom of spirit. Farrell's sad eyes speak volumes of emotion that could never be expressed in spoken words and Bale's kind-hearted demeanor is just perfect. ""The New World"" is like a poem. What I got out of it was a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth, a swirl of images and sounds in my mind and a wealth of emotion in my heart",The New World

The New World is a miserably slow movie that seems desperate to try and impress us with its obnoxious long shots and absolute crap narration. Colin Farrell's acting is so wooden that he wears the look of surprise for the film's copious length. What's worse, if there could be worse, is the ""noble savage"" treatment of the native Americans. I thought, foolishly, that we had moved far enough along that maybe we realized that the people that first inhabited the United States were, in fact, people. However, it appears Mr. Malick disagrees, turning the Native Americans into barking, sniffing animals who ponder only what any caricatured Indian would ponder...you know, water, wind, and spirit.

Being both highly interesting and educational, the movie held our interest throughout. At our age, we often fall asleep during movies, but neither I nor my wife lost interest in this well acted story, in spite of its 2¼ hour length.The problem for us was the inaudible dialogue, comprised of much whispering and low muttering by the actors as well as an unnecessary and unwanted narrator. The soundtrack (other than a deafening, indefinable roar during the opening and closing of the movie) was beautiful, although it too managed to drown out much of the dialogue.

I didn't really pay any attention to the negative reviews first time around as obviously they're in the minority given this movies high rating.
Something stinks about this rating. It's so high it couldn't possibly come from public consumption of this movie. Either it's a mistake or someone's on the fiddle.
The only good thing to say about it, is it's shot well.
If you could sit two hours looking at various photos that look pretty that seem without end or thread between the various imagery and you'd like to be philosophical about them, you maybe better off doing that. There's no denying it looks well.
We could get the most highly skilled director to film various angles of turds for two hours and admire his skills of equally measure.
Yet that's not the point, we would like the story to contrast with what we are seeing on the screen and the good shots revolve around an equally good story.
This makes a grand gesture and attempt at a movie it pulls off beautifully without a story that will bore you ridged.
It could be defined as art, as art can only be art if that's its only purpose. That maybe why the movie stinks as it was designed for its artistic merit and not actually to be a movie and that's the point we are all missing whom are negative about this film.
If that's the case it shouldn't be sold to us as a movie and then we wouldn't be disappointed.
Just when you think the movie has taken a turn for the better and you're actually getting somewhere, you're reminded that you shouldn't do things to get somewhere. You should do them because you enjoy them or else be bored ridged and face an empty existence and life without meaning. Just as this movie has no meaning whatsoever but to characterise one of the all time lows of human history, when the British Empire exterminated a nation for their own superiority no different to such accusations made against Adolf Hitler and they be characterised as a tradgic love story. 
It's as if someone had taken the superficial and tried to make it grand, magestic, philosophical and artistic.
Therefore such doesn't appeal to you, you'll see right through the movie, feel underwhelmed, as though you're having your intelligence insulted and as though you've been robbed of your money and two hours of your life.
Don't do it!

I wish I read the 1 vote comments before, because all the ones I read after I pout it back was sooooo true. Yes, it can be poetic, but this new-age kind of wavy moves, it's so unreal. Like when Poc shoes the eyes, or water or whatever, if you try to describe something like she does, I can tell you that Capt. Smith is VERY intelligent to understand what she means. When you want to learn a language, you usually show the thing, not describe it sophistically (I don't find the right word, I'm not English speaking) That makes no sense. So we didn't even look at ti till the end. We stopped after 45 min. Like someone else said, if you don't like action movie, just go and look at this one.",The New World
315,timmy242,Utterly Craptacular!,1,31 January 2006,"Malick is true to form in this, his latest and greatest cinematic offering. I have chosen to award this film with the most symbolic rating, a 3. Three. Let us pause to reflect. Three is the way the thesis meets the antithesis and becomes synthesis! Three is the way the liminal is whole, becomes separate seeker, and is reintegrated back into society! Three is the highest, most representative and appropriate rating I am willing to give for such a mewling, self-indulgent, disjointed and pretentious piece of crap of a movie since the Thin Red Line. Oh wait, Malick did that one too. Imagine that. Visually stunning, careful and methodic. Malick brings a poet's sense of tone and a philosopher's pointlessness to his audience. Oh, no, it's not that I didn't ""get it,"" or thought it was overlong or boring. Quite the contrary. I knew exactly what I was watching chapter/verse, metaphor/meaning, as I would know the repeated beating of a Powhatan war club to my brain. Who were the Powhatan? Well, you wouldn't know by watching this movie that's for sure! No, while the movie was mytho-historically, culturally and in all other ways mundanely accurate, it was to my way of thinking a near total waste of celluloid and low, low expectations. Did I say totally meaningful and overly creative at the expense of cohesion and story content? If you are looking to see some amazing actors and wasted talent, beautiful imagery and beat-you-over-the-head artistic form for the already pretentious - please go see this movie. I don't hate this movie. Really. How could I? I gave it a three.",The New World

And if we had not had the closed captioning on, almost half the movie would have not been heard or understood. They speak so soft that one may have missed half the movie that way.

317,thxrvg,An Old Dream Made New Again,8,21 August 2006,"John Smith is an outcast in an from his society. That much is clear. He does not fit into the confines of his culture, and for his mutinous behaviour, is physically confined. It is hardly surprising that he should be the one reaching over to the natives. The young girl, on the other hand, seems in tune with her own culture and people. So why is she the one who replies? I think it's because of her connection with Mother. Mother, of course, is Nature, both in the physical and spiritual sense, and including both the general and the human sense. It is that universal quality which connects us to the outside world, to our inner self, and to our fellow human beings. The young girl, being connected to that source, thus becomes a being fit to connect with the foreign party. She understands this, and so does Smith. She is faithful to it, Smith betrays this belief, and her with it.I think that Mallick is trying to show, in Smith, the acknowledged allure of the 'New World', and the fact that this 'New World' was destroyed by the explorers and colonizers. It's consistently emphasized throughout the film, and forms one of the central arguments therein (the contrast between the natives and the starving Englishmen and boys is stark,disturbing, and obvious).Much more pronounced is the young girl's transformation. It must be emphasized that she does not have a name until she is baptized. We have come to call her Pocahontas, but that is our designation, not hers. When she is named Rebecca, it forms the culminating act in the murder of the young girl that effectively began the moment that contact was established. It is almost inevitable; the moment that you come into contact with the other party, life will never be the same. What is so extraordinary is what an extreme form the young girl's transformation takes. I don't mean just in terms of clothing, language, and other external features. More important is the (apparent) death of her spirit. Did you notice how little she smiles? The most fascinating moment at the beginning of the film was was when the colonizers met with the natives in the field, both eyeing each other curiously and threateningly, until the camera fixed on this wonderful girl who was playing with her friend, and who gave us this wonderful smile! And what happened when that smiled disappeared? To me, what it signalled was that the young girl, now young woman, had lost her connection with Mother.She finds it in the end, in a scene that is rather abrupt for a film that knows how to take its time. I think that her meaning is clear enough: her son is the manifestation of the universal link between all human beings. This is not only true on a spiritual or idealistic level, but is rooted in biological fact: what connects all human beings is that they are one species, and that is only true so long as they can copulate and produce offspring. Once that connection is confirmed, the young woman (whose 'real' self remains unnamed in the film) can return to her home. But that, alas, is not possible. The moment that contact was established, her 'home' was destroyed. So, what other solution is there? Death, of course. And that's precisely what happens.The ending, from this perspective, seems quite conclusive. But I find there to be an undercurrent which is quite disturbing. So why is it that it is not portrayed? The reason, I think, is simple and has been hinted at above: this film, like the actors in it, and like the audience watching it, are the product of the post-contact period. We are all part of that age which is founded in large part on the colonization of the Americas. And that being so, we are all denied access to what had existed before then. Why so? Because once the different civilizations met each other, inevitably, they collapsed into a new, and comprehensive entity, which had Europe, certainly, as the standard, but which nonetheless liberally took whatever it needed from the native cultures. Maize and tobacco are just two of the more famous examples. The entire American double-continent is an even better one.Knowing this, I found myself profoundly saddened by the film. What it gives us, or tries to give us, is a glimpse into a world that does not exist anymore. Perhaps it never existed at all. But the idea of it does. And to think of that idea as something that is not realized, and perhaps never was realized, is profoundly saddening. Let me put it this way: none of us will ever know what it felt like to be like that young girl and to correspond directly with Mother. None of us will be able to go back to that world the way that she does at the end when the dances in the garden in England (even if that return is momentary).If we can never access this world, how is it that the film was made at all? I think the answer is stated in the film, but in a contradictory fashion. John Smith states, twice, that what he felt when he was with the young girl was reality, and everything else a dream, an illusion. The opposite is true: what he felt was a dream. The rest, and that is everything, is reality. This is not meant to be a criticism. On the contrary, the existence of this dream is very consoling. That is because the idea of the New World was and is a wonderful dream. The reality was and is a nightmare. This is the story of one woman who is treated rather well by the Europeans. There are 22 million dead people whose stories did not turn out so well. They tell the real story. Malick gives us the dream.",The New World
318,dhobbes1,"Yet another phony dredging up of ""Pocahontas"".",1,2 May 2007,"It's bad enough that Disney did a complete sanitizing of the John Smith - Pocohantas tale, including misrepresenting her as an adult so as to better palm the story off on kids. Now, we have ""The New World"" (DVD) which gives a romanticized account of Smith (Colin Farrel) as a smitten pedophile whose earnest devotion wins this child-woman (Q'orianka Kilcher) over after she bravely defies her father Smith's life. So, Hollywood still has as much trouble as ever in getting real about history. Fact is, Smith and Pocohantas were never more than good friends -- that business about sparing his life simply was ritual the Algonquin nation performed when they took prisoners. The rest of the movie similarly is cut from whole cloth, spinning a yarn that, actually, on top of being fictional is poorly directed and, accordingly, would have to go backward to move any more slowly. Quite sickeningly, it close on a smarmy, heart-warming note without even a mention at the closing credits of how Pocohantas, a young and still-flowering woman, met her end as a casualty of English ""discovery"" and ""exploration"" of a land its indigenous inhabitants already owned. Christopher Plummer and Christian Bale, as John Rolfe, the Englishman with whom she did get involved and eventually married (one of the few real events in this overdrawn, melodramatic fantasy) are gifted actors put to absolutely no good use.

An honest and unflinching, but at the same time lyrical and stylized depiction of love, and the clash of cultures.

While a 'relationship' between Pocahontas and John Smith makes for an touching myth, for a big budget film to perpetuate this fairy tale is unfortunate to say the least.

323,rghawkin,A masterpiece,10,28 January 2006,"This film is a masterpiece, pure and simple, on every level.... acting, cinematography, costume design, makeup, screenplay, music, directing, etc, etc. It's one of those rare films which transports you to a different time and place, and makes you believe, really believe that it's real (or could have been real). Unlike most one-dimensional movies, which either portray European settlers as good guys against savage barbarians, or Europeans as brutal conquerors and native people as noble saints; this film acknowledges the reality: there was savagery and nobility on both sides, but most of the time, it was real people on both sides who were each facing a ""new world"".The scenery is beautiful, almost mystical. The acting is right-on, from the young actress who plays a native princess with passion, emotion, and joy; to the men who come to love her (each very different and brilliantly portrayed), to the reliable Christopher Plummer and August Schellenberg as tough but fair leaders of their people, to the array of actors in supporting roles.Some reviewers have criticized the film for a lack of ""plot"" or ""storyline"". Sure, if you're looking for the next ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Sixth Sense"" with a surprise around every corner, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for car crashes and chainsaws and dismembered body parts in every other frame, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for gratuitous nudity and sex, you'll be disappointed. BUT, if you're seeking an epic story with gorgeous cinematography which delves into the thoughts, emotions, and actions of people who are interesting and who you REALLY care about over the course of years, then this is for you. The film reminded me of the best and most beloved of the epic romance/adventures of the past: Gone With The Wind, Doctor Zhivago, Out Of Africa, etc. This film will rank with, and possibly surpass, those classics.This is a must-see.

I thought the editing was brilliant because it moved along at a slow but continual pace, like the river so often shown in the movie. But most of all, I loved the interaction between the actors, especially Q'Orianka. She's so hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing.

When the first and only big battle scene, there comes the monologue of the actor 'Lord,turn other way of your face. You desire not a dead sinner.'That touches me a lot. But what make the film disordered one is bellowing when director hasn't show us a detail cultural clash he turn to describe a common different race's love story. Finally, director makes the local girl civilized. That's all reasonable.But it seem director want to show us more mean beyond the common modern style.

She finally decide who is her true lover between the two guys? The son will merge two culture? As she said everything will die expect her son? I really get mixed.

The age difference on the movie wasn't as bad as actual real life. They literally seemed almost the same age in the movie but in history they were 11 years apart. I liked the plot twist at the end were she ended up dying and were she was playing with her kid but it was her spirit not really her. Also how she adapted to the new workd when she came to it.

The movie spends as much time if not more on dialog-less, long tracking shots of walks in the woods as it does on Pocahontos children being born or on her dying on the way back to America. In other words it wasted a lot of time on stuff that didn't matter. There were also jump cuts something I rarely see in any movie like a scene would suddenly go back then jump into another scene like a drop frame of something very disrupted to the flow of most movies but with this one it just a devise to wake you up.

While I do understand that art-lovers might find this movie fascinating, the average Joe will simply fall asleep during the first 30 minutes. And I consider him lucky as I stayed awake.There are so many things that are so entirely wrong with this movie. First and foremost the teaser: It makes you believe that there's actually something happening in this movie. That it's about coming to America. That there might even be some action, a killing of Indians, etc.Well, it's not.I don't think that a movie needs to have action and blood, but it needs to be something more than the product of someone putting a camera on a piece of wood and collecting 2 hours of ""pure nature"". This movie is about characters and characters only. Not character development, no, characters. Doing their thing. Someone else wrote ""most of the dialogues in this movie - which are actually monologues - are entirely consisting of minute-long close-ups of the faces of the actors and you have to imagine what they are thinking"". Well, this person deserves the Oscar of film-critics as he certainly saved some lives with this brave comment. Believe me, he is right.The movie has some scenes where it goes dark and the next chapter in the never-ending tale is about to start. At every of these scenes, several people in the cinema got up, hoping for this movie to be over. They were actually breathing out loud like they just made it through a marathon.

I have been disappointed big time.I guess the first five minutes, when no one's talking in the movie, have been put in on purpose.

It's really more of an emotionally driven movie, with the dialogue as an accessory to the story, not the driving force. I loved the way Virginia was shown. It really is a beautiful state. And, of course, everyone knows the story, but to see it again was lovely. I heard a lot of negative things about this movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

The reviews here can also seem unpleasantly 'superior' .. as in ""if you don't get this you are cinematically illiterate"" ... This is nasty stuff and points to a similar weakness in the film too - it is overly self-satisfied.

This is a strong point of Malicks too, so I wanted to pair her up with his work. We enjoyed the 'experience' as some reviewers insist on calling it, but the film also tires, and often infuriates with repetitive non-verbal cues. Yes, Terry, we get it, the first time.

But having this terrific actors and actresses, have turned the movie into a disaster.I will try to explain what i disliked and what i liked about this movie Dislikes: Nearly everything except for the cast members.The music itself was not even a music it would be so 'cool' if there was none because for 90% of the film the same track was repeating itself from different 'locations' of itself.The technical details in the movie: or lets say the empty parts or the parts where you say: ''hey what just happened? they were not... come on this is ridiculous''... there were a lot of them. The connection between scenes were so weak that sometimes i've felt like i was watching 2 or 3 different movies at a time.The story and directing: i have only one thing to ask; 'What were you thinking?' the scripts were unbelievably lame, the story and how it develops is a total disaster.Likes: The cast members: It is very rare to find such a great cast -honestly-. and every one of them made me believe who they were despite the fact that the whole concept of the movie is a total failure.To sum; The very reason i wanted to get out of the cinema in the break(for the first time in my 23 years of life) was that i couldn't resist to see the effort of the cast members in the failing concept of the camera angles, the 'speech and playback technique', (i didn't want to write a spoiler so you'll understand what i'm saying by this when you see the movie) the non existence of thrill and logic and so on..I would have never given 5 out of 10 if the cast was this perfect but this 'flawlessness' in actor and actress choice made the movie a disaster.

I also like shots of nature. Give me grass, sky, birds, whatever you got, I usually like it.HOWEVER, when I rented this movie, I had a horrible flashback to ""The Thin Red Line"" before I even got to the counter at Blockbuster. I went to the theatre to see it, shortly after I saw ""Saving Private Ryan"", thinking it would be a thoughtful war movie. I was ready to see a movie like that...But ""The Thin Red Line"" is not that movie. It was a horrible movie filled with tall, lush, waving grass. I know this because that is where the camera sat pretty much the whole bloody time. I also remember not being able to understand what people were saying. In this day and age, the audio should not sound like crap, and I have no idea why it did.So back to""The New World."" It is another slow, tedious movie with very little emotional involvement by actors who are, at times, almost impossible to hear. Yes, many artsy shots. Plenty of nature. But the story cannot be communicated by hand motions, soulful eyes and fuzzy eyebrows (yes Colin--that means you!).And the soundtrack was so weak. Who said that a symphony blaring over all the action is a good idea? Whoever had that bright idea should not be encouraged to do THAT ever again. And speaking of things never to do again, I am adding watching movies directed by this Malick fellow to my own personal ""Don't Do"" list.

339,acexec,Well crafted but simply misses the mark IMHO.,6,23 July 2006,"I loved Thin Red Line....But I gotta say this movie just did not hit the mark. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting great as well. And although I love Malick, and Thin Red Line is far and away my favorite war move, I would wish there were more arcs in this. That is to say I wish the arc itself was more prominent. Malick tends to emphasize beauty and atmosphere it seems over plot or even melodrama, which is great, but this might be pushing it. Thin Red Line, I suppose, had the benefit of being a remake, and although one could call this a remake of course, it really isn't if you look at it objectively.I, respectfully, have to give this one a thumbs down for anyone but hardcore movie/history/Christian Bale/ or Colin Farrel fans.acexec",The New World
340,hsvfxeditorial,A vast disappointment,3,27 February 2006,"The New World, scripted and directed by Terrence Malick basically stretches what would be about 40mins worth of screen time into 2.5 hrs. The plot revolves about John Smith and his love for a Native American girl (basically Pocahontas) This could be a premise for a promising historical epic were it not for some severe problems:The plot is incredibly thin for too long a movie, you get long, long scenes of them falling in love. I think Malick must have fallen in love with Q'Orianka Kilcher so many low angle, adoring shots he's done of her. That in itself is okay but the film's biggest flaw is the editing. Four editors were unable to weave a cohesive, organized plot line. The film jumps from one scene to another, villages are burned without due explanation, ships come and go and the reasons as to what happens and why are never explored in detail. On top of that the editing style takes some getting used to to put it mildly. Some whimsical cuts would normally be regarded flat out as editing mistakes in the professional world. Unnecessary jump cuts, black ""drop outs"" etc are some of the tidbits that are not exactly conducive to the film's clarity. Even James Horner's score was lackluster, with a few self rip offs from Braveheart.",The New World

342,moebiuscolombia,started slow and boring turned good at the end,8,3 April 2012,"I watched this movie like 4 months ago with a group of 4 which were: my Husband, friend , 11 year old daughter and me. It is true what people has said there are two options: you will love or hate it , no in between. I think it has to do with taste and what kind of person you are. After 40 minutes seeing it my husband says: This is a really boring and bad movie.And inside of me I said please don't let it be like the movie Tree of Life. My husband hated this last one because he hates slow paced movies, but even worse when there is almost no talking between characters.The problem is it does not have much talking, the movie is slow, and the speaking you hear in the movie are the mind of Collin Farell saying who am I, why am I here, does she love me , Do I love her, is this real love and things like that. But do not get discouraged for what I am saying it starts a little boring but near the middle end it gets good. It leaves a message and I liked it. And better then that is that it happened in real life with the real pocahontas .I give it 8 points because of the good ending and I mean because of the guy Pocahontas picks.I recommend seeing a movie called the 5 people you meet in heaven, this one has a very deep spiritual message and I am sure if you likes The New World you will also like the one I am recommending.",The New World
343,keltic_chi,"A very inspiring movie, the harmony of silence and emotions stands out among the low-quality Hollywood productions",9,13 January 2006,"I just came back from the movies, here in Rome, so obviously I didn't get a chance to watch the original version. I must say I'm not familiar with Malick's movies, in fact this is the first one I watch.Although being static and quiescent, the movie has touched me in a particular way. I found the emptiness of silences, nature sounds and gazes lost in the vacuum of hidden emotions, inspiring. One of the few movies where the importance of silence is completely understood, where a gaze can explain everything, where a simple love story, a naive, childish relationship can give you a lot.Most people came out of the movies feeling as if they had wasted their money or saying that they had been terribly bored, on the verge of falling asleep. Well, I'm sorry for them if they didn't appreciate it and failed to understand it. The message is clear, we enter a world beyond the frivolities of modern movies, a world where an impossible love is crowned by the everlasting judgment of nature in its wildest powers. Malick putting together an excellent cast, including my fellow Dutchman Van Wageningen and I thought that the young Pocahontas was an excellent choice for this movie. Her grace, humble beauty and ingenuity are not a stereotype or oversimplification of the character, these attributes make her stand out as a real princess facing a hard trial in a life that could have been different, but definitely worth less living.I would have given this movie a 10 if it wasn't for the ending ... the situation that builds up is a bit complicated and hard to deal with in 15 minutes, maybe more. Does Pocahontas' death really conclude the story in the right way? It takes up a touch of Greek tragedy in some way, although if one can say that death is never an ending, the native American philosophy fits in well.As someone else said, I feel as if I'll be one of the few who actually did appreciate and understand this movie. I compared it to a Reiki CD in some way.",The New World

If you want to spend your free time with any sense then please let this one go by.The story is slow going, lacks direction, is not very believable and the conversation is uninteresting to say the very, very least. Sometimes the cinematography can raise the level of a movie with a historic setting a little, but even in this department the movie fails to score.I can only recommend this movie if there is absolutely nothing in the house that can make you go to sleep.

If this film had been made 15 years ago, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan might have starred in it. However, aside from the scenery, my opinion is that the Disney version is much more interesting.I think that it would be more credible, not politically correct, if someday filmmakers chose Native American actors to portray Native Americans. In this film, Q'Orianka Kilcher, whose father (according to IMDb) is a Quechua Indian from South America, portrays Pocahontas. Her mother is a native Swede from Alaska.I predict that many people are going to like this movie, but I would rather see one about the Lewis and Clark Expedition. There is much more of a story there. That would make a good mini-series too.On the other hand, why not re-work the Pocahontas story so that it takes place in outer space.

The awkwardness of bad actors or extras from the look of it in random places clearly with no direction of any kind on what to do in the shots.

I get what the director is trying to do, but fails miserably at it. He is trying to make us love the characters and be in love with the scenery but what we get is an insult to our intelligence.

350,robin-hillyard,Opportunities seized and missed,8,23 January 2006,"I knew right away from the trailer that I wanted to see this movie. And the photography and soundtrack (other than the spoken dialog) did not disappoint - they are truly superb. The visuals/aurals of nature are particularly good. The overall effect is stunning. But... I have quite a few quibbles. The dialog, when there is any, is often maddeningly incoherent. The characters seem to be sharing their secrets with just the people in the front row. The continuity is at times strangely non-sequitous. Whether this is intentional or just poor editing I cannot tell. Horner's music is good though there is insufficient original material to get truly excited by it. The inclusion of the Adagio from Mozart's 23rd Piano Concerto is sublime. Even there, though, the timing relative to the action is sometimes a little odd (and entry of the piano a trifle abrupt). Leaving aside any comment on the historical aspects (I'm not qualified to comment), it's hard to know if there is a message we are supposed to take away. The acting is excellent, with the exception of the diction (as mentioned above), particularly if you like to see your heroes looking more goofy than usual. As historical fiction, I was somewhat disappointed. But as a spectacle it is very good. If you're interested at all, I urge you to see it in the movie theater - your DVD player won't do it justice when the time comes. The one opportunity that was grasped firmly and successfully was for the director to be self-indulgent. If you can live with that, then you should definitely go and see it.",The New World
351,kingfinn_2000,The New Boredom,1,5 February 2006,"If your expecting this film to be anything like ""Last of the Mohicans"" you will be very disappointed.The film itself is 2 and a half hours long in which nothing what so ever happens, the only fight scene if you can call it that lasts about 3 minutes. The rest of the film is like a very boring montage of over the top orchestral music and pointless imagery. I think the director was trying to create a visual masterpiece but none of the scenery was interesting or breath taking, e.g. some hedges in England were shown for about ten minutes interlinked with Pocahontas splashing her face in a puddle, while the same orchestra music that had been playing continuously through the whole film was just played even louder.The main character Captain John Smith is actually from my home town of Alford in Lincolnshire, England, so i cant understand why Colin Farrel was cast to play him, the distinctive Irish accent completely destroyed the credibility of the whole film. Nearly half of all the dialogue in the film was narrated by the various characters telling you nonsense that had nothing to do with anything, instead of them just speaking with each other. The first half of the movie is the love story between the Native Indian Princess Pocahontas and John Smith set in ""The New World"", the second half is the same story again but set in England with a different love interest in the form of Christian Bale.I don't know what the director was trying to achieve but he failed, there was no change in pace throughout and i was left feeling like it never really got started, there was nothing educational in it, there was no real character motivation or interaction due to the constant narration which was incredibly annoying, Colin Farrel just cant sound inspirational!I am now going to recreate the film by playing 30 seconds of Beethovens 9th on a loop for two and a half hours while staring at a bush in my garden!",The New World

353,gonzmend,Review on movie 4B,2,30 August 2018,"I am watching this movie for a history class to understand what it felt like to live in this time period. The plot of this movie is mostly just explaining how they used to live and how hard it to live different ways. The Native Americans lived with no electricity or any kind of easy out life like it is today or in our modern world. The English had a lot for them, they had better guns food and even better armor. I feel that the film maker is trying to tell us that there are two different kinds of lives and that not everybody in the world always has it easy. The time period that it was in was pretty noticeable from they way that they were talking and their surrounding, When you looked at what they owned was also pretty easy to tell that it was probably 1600s. The way that they dressed, spoke, and even how they still had queens and kings. My only question that I felt like asking was if they didn't care about how women were treated and that if they were still just meant to do what the male asked them to do. A few thing that I liked about this movie was how it actually showed us how it was like especially how the kids in the movie actually were struggle not to see them suffer but how the movie actually was truthful. The violence in the movie is also interesting like how the English had guns and the Native american had stick and arrows. I didn't like how the movie didnt really give that much interesting it was mostly a movie that you had to pay attention to understand. I kind of liked it. Its not a movie that I would probably watch again but just for expedience. I dont really blame the movie on the director because all movies are different and not the same.",The New World
354,bevjohn,First contact with 'aliens'--whether they are native Americans or the English--can be a shock.,7,21 January 2006,"In this stunningly filmed movie, we see the naturals (as the British settlers call them) before we see the sailing ships-- like three large, strange birds settled on wooden nests-- sail into Chesapeake Bay. Even before they have seen the ships and been stunned by that sight, the natives are as silent as if they are part of a tribe of mutes. We feel fear on their part. Little do they know who and what fate is sailing into their peaceful kingdom---but we know. We already know the history, sort of.As played by Colin Farrell, John Smith, the hero, looks so excessively hairy and dirty in contrast to the almost hairless Indians that he seems the one who is primitive, a throw-back to some Cro-Magnon, perhaps. All right, we think; he's just made a trip across the ocean; they must all be a mess. Yet we can't help noticing that Christopher Plummer looks reasonably neat and well-groomed as the President of the Virginia Company, right from the moment he steps off the ship. Farrell doesn't clean up on shore, either. He shows no sign of the kind of energy or intelligence that would suggest him capable of such disobedience as mutiny. He has no swagger, no spirit. As well, he looks so morose, even after he is spared from hanging, that his heavy eyebrows threaten to consume the entire film. In voice-overs he says that he will let this new world be a new beginning for him, but he never looks hopeful. And when he speaks, it is in an interior monologue that sounds taken from his later journals, and is so mumbled that we can hardly hear what he says. Surely this role has been terribly miscast.. Later, when Christian Bale appears later as one of the second batch of English settlers, looking clean and handsome, and smiling tenderly at Pocahantas, should we really be wondering what she could have possibly seen in Smith? Or why Bale wasn't the one cast as Smith?As played by Native American Q'Orianka Killich, Pocahantas strikes us as quite wonderful, a still, gentle and yet playful child of nature. Her face, which we see a lot of in this slow, meditative film, can look like something carved by the Incas when she is pensive, yet can look completely North American when she smiles and laughs in play. Her gestures are graceful, and her dignity gives new meaning to the phrase 'noble savage'. Smith's infatuation with her is understandable, but as played by Farrell, it's as if he has gone from morose to lovesick with no suggestion that he has other moods, or any other personality. We see a few minutes in which he teaches her a few words of English, but that lesson is initiated by her, and he hardly seems to have enough concentration to take part in it. Nor does he seem at all interested in learning her language. It is a shock, not soon after, then, to hear her speak perfect English, and see him supposedly understanding what her father has to say to him. When did they have time to learn verbs, much less full sentences, of each other's languages? All they've been doing is drifting around looking at each other.When he's not with her, Farrell/Smith keeps the same lovesick expression, even upon returning to the primitive Jamestown, which seems all the more primitive after our seeing the simple but well settled Indian camp. He does little to help the starving men: doesn't suggest that they might fish in the river, or hunt in the forest full of game. Nothing has been planted, or hunted. We wonder: were the English really this unprepared to make a settlement? Why? The film's dialog doesn't tell us any more than that the men sent along on this expedition weren't 'very good.' And meanwhile, Smith, who been described by the President of the Company as a natural leader, just looks away from the mess with an expression that suggests he has a bad case of gas.No doubt he's supposed to be disgusted by the contrast between the Indian's ingenuity in survival and his own compatriot's, but he just looks as if he's thinking of his new Indian friend. More dialog is needed here; the script has failed both the actors and us.The film still succeeds as a still, meditative piece, reminiscent of both 'Elvira Madigan' and 'Dances With Wolves'. The score here is beautiful, with haunting use of the prelude to Wagner's 'Rhinegold' to suggest the rich beauty of this world into which the settlers are sailing. All in all, the film is so slow and gentle that it casts its spell over us, a spell that lasts for several hours after the credits have rolled. And yet I'll bet many viewers will run home and Google both Pocahantas and John Smith to learn the truth about their relationship: was it chaste or not? And they may also want to try to determine why on earth Farrell was chosen for this part. He, and the slow pace of this film will, I think, make it one a film that does not thrive by word of mouth advertisement.",The New World
355,punishterli1,This movie is a boring love story!,1,20 May 2006,This movie is a movie of an extremely boring sort which is why I have written this review. To explain this movie you could say that it is kinda like watching a documentary on Pocahontas except there is a bit of drama in it. So really this movie is somewhere in between a documentary and a movie because it is very informative and with a bit of drama. As I have said this movie is a documentary but when you rent or buy this movie your probably not thinking about watching a documentary and this is a 2 hour documentary that never seems to gets to the point so to speak because this movie has such a simple plot two people falling in love. This goes on the entire movie and in the end the girl falls in love with another guy and the first guy isn't even jealous which doesn't make sense.

This is the only movie I've ever felt was so close to being great but failed by just a few errors. LENGTH: You already know about the length -- just a little editing would have gone a long way, but I happen to like long movies.ACCENT: The irony that makes watching the DVD bug me is how a director insisted on forcing a Native American to speak English perfectly after only a few years. Why? The languages couldn't have been more different! You'd think someone on the set would have spoken-up -- pun intended -- and reminded him that since lots of the key crew had foreign accents -- and probably spoke English for decades -- then, perhaps Pocahontas would have one too. MAKE-UP: If the make-up department could have stepped in during the last part of the movie to actually age the characters, it would have prevented me from jolting out to the story to realize how young a now aged Pocahontas looked. MUSIC: I love Mozart, however his music didn't fit in with many scenes, especially the dance scene. A little more authentic Native American music -- especially during said dance scene -- would have gone such a long way.He was just so close to creating a true masterpiece that it's a crying shame a few errors prevented him from reaching that goal.",The New World

When I first started watching it I thought it was poorly edited as things seemed to jump from scene to scene but as it progressed I found myself engrossed in the beauty of it. I did a some research about the characters and from what I found out the relationship between Pocahontas and John Smith as depicted in the film is pure fiction. Pocahontas was eleven years old when she met Smith and although they became friends there was no romance between them.The actors in the film were excellent and romantic scenes between Colin Farrell, Christain Bale and Q'Orianka Kilcher where filmed tastefully as they had to be since Q'Orianka was 14 when she made this film.

Yes, I've read the other comments here, and I can appreciate their views. Perhaps someday I'll try again and get further through the movie. It just struck me that a wonderful topic, setting, and cast were wasted on two hours of watching people walk around and horrible, jarring cuts from one moment or scene to another.

362,tmutchell,Who would have guessed that colonizing the New World could have been this boring?,1,31 May 2006,"Dreadful. That is the best word I can use to describe this film. It starts out slow...and then tapers off. This subject had all the makings of a great story: flight from European oppression, venturing into the Unknown, internal conflicts, struggle for survival, battles with the indigenous peoples, romance. All of these things should lend themselves to an interesting and engaging movie. Instead, we get over two hours of a beautifully filmed, but self-indulgent, preachy, meandering, and ultimately boring work. There is little dialogue, with most of the characters preferring to monologue (almost inaudibly) and/or pray as they wander through the forest. There is even less action, with the few battle scenes and occasional power struggles (between John Smith and those who would usurp his command) having little buildup and being over quickly, which is about the only thing in this tedious movie that does happen quickly. You would expect that a film about the men who first tried to colonize Virginia to be exciting or at the very least interesting, but it's a 135-minute marathon to see whether you can stay awake and resist the urge to fast-forward through the obviously overdone and drawn out scenery shots. Also, you'll spend a lot of time turning up the volume to hear the self-important and pretentious voice-overs, of which there are many.There are two, and only two, good things about this movie. The first is Q'Orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas. She's beautiful, and seems a very promising young actress, even if Malick did have her wandering around and mumbling for most of the movie. The other is the filming, which is very picturesque and authentic. (I visited the Jamestown settlement in Virginia, and the film, shot in natural light on a nearby river in Virginia, looks identical.) But even at that, we are forced to sit through shots and sequences that easily take 3-4 times as long as is necessary to get the point across. For some reason, 45 seconds or more after it is blindingly apparent that Pocahantas is ""whimsical"" or that Smith is ""sad"", we're still watching her skipping through the forest or him standing alone in a field (and mumbling his monologue, of course).Each of the elements that should make this an excellent film is somehow wasted. The struggle for survival, with men in the fort boiling their own belts to eat the leather, becomes laughable when the Powhatans bring deer and other game to help the colony. Why didn't they just go out and hunt for themselves? For a colony struggling to survive, whose crops are failing, without enough food, at war with the Natives in a strange land, with shaky leadership and little support from England...the characters in this movie spend an awful lot of time just walking, at an excruciatingly slow pace, around the compound and talking to each other (or, more frequently, to themselves). Shouldn't they be working at something? Shouldn't someone in this film be in some kind of hurry? And as for romance, how could any woman feel romantic toward Farrell's character, who never looks anything but forlorn throughout the entire movie? How could any man identify with him or want him to succeed in leading these people, when he seems so dispassionate and distracted for so much of the film? This movie could have been to the Jamestown settlement what Dances With Wolves was to the Old West. That movie was also beautifully filmed, and didn't over-simplify the roles of heroes and villains, but kept the story moving. Even with a plodding actor like Costner, numerous voice-overs and three hours or more to watch, you stayed glued to your seat. The only thing keeping you in your seat through The New World is gravity, and that becomes less compelling as this dud of a film drags on and on and on...I tell you, if the ""new world"" was really as boring as The New World, it's amazing anyone else ever came across The Pond.",The New World

Terrence Malick has marked out a new world of incoherence in film-making. Not one frame of this movie makes any sense. It is so bad that you don't even have the pleasure of laughing at it. To weep over it would only be tears wasted on something Dead On Arrival. The actors--all of them--seem stunned, gob-smacked to have to utter unutterable lines. Ms Kilcher is beyond clueless. Farrell, Bale, and Plummer seem to be in a dream--no, a nightmare--from which they can't awaken. Jonathon Pryce gets off easy in his 5 seconds on screen. He has to say nothing.

For the colonists, the new world was a wilderness more attuned to the devil's playground than any sort of paradise we might have imagined the colonists thought they had encountered. For the Powhatan Chesapeake Indians, the invading colonists were, as Mallick accurately depicted, a double edged sword representing both a gift and a threat to their way of life. In these aspects Mallick was quite successful in his depiction of the the Jamestown colony.Here's where the movie fell down: There was no romance between Pocahontas and John Smith; not ever. At best Smith may have looked at the girl (yes, when they met she was only 13 years old so girl is appropriate. Even though amongst her own people she may have been ready or nearly ready for marriage, Smith's culture would have frowned on a man of his stature and social standing becoming involved with someone so young. More to the point, however, was the missed opportunity in this movie to demonstrate Powhatan's political savvy and his perception of the colonists as possible allies in his own attempts to enlarge his own Powhatan confederacy amongst the Chesapeake region. More beneficial to the story and to audiences would have been a demonstration of the relationship between Powhatan, Pocahantas, and Oppenchancanough (Powhatan's war chief). It is important to remember that despite initial difficulties, the Powhatan Indians and the Jamestown colonies lived in relative peace for nearly 12 years during which the traded and intermarried; this is the real story. Pocahantas' part in it should have been just that, a part in the role of a political emissary doing her father's bidding.As for the making of the movie, it is quite apparent that a great deal of effort went into the costumes, sets, and even the language and cultural elements of the Powhatan peoples. It is a shame that they weren't used more to the benefit of the real story.Final comments: I would really love to see someone make movies of a couple of the ""People Of"" series known as the First Americans series by W. Michael Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear. These books are based on actual archaeological, anthropological, and historical evidence and all of the books include a bibliography to show where the authors (both of whom are professional archaeologists by the way) go their data. Any thoughts?If you are wondering what my credentials are that I bring to the table, I am a PhD candidate at the dissertation stage at the University of Colorado-Boulder and I have devoted more than 75% of my academic training to the pursuit of studying Native American history. Does that make me a know it all? Not by a long shot; I will say however, that I recognize a wasted opportunity to tell a story when I see it and unfortunately, The New World has missed its mark.",The New World
365,javathehutt,More like watching a poem than a movie,10,30 January 2006,"If you're looking for your typical Colin Farrell action movie, you'll definitely want to pass on this. If you like movies to be spoon-fed to you in bite-size plot points, you'll want to pass. Malicks New World is more like watching a poem than a movie.The New World traces the virgin paths of emotion and contemplation traveled by these characters inwardly as they encounter cultures and peoples of which they could not have conceived until now. I found a bittersweet melancholy in the way the inner journeys of Pocohantas (Q'Orianka Kilcher), Smith (Colin Farrell), and Rolfe (Christian Bale) reflect the outward struggle between the Europeans and this new world they have encountered.The movie was filmed to capture emotion and spirit, thus leaving the audience dizzy with the amour and confusion the characters experience together. The chemistry between the characters was gripping, and the romance elegantly and tastefully captured both visually and audibly in the ballet of prayers they whisper.I highly recommend The New World to anyone who enjoys artistic films. I only hope that we don't have to wait another eight years for another film from Malick.",The New World

The movie, especially the New World section, is all meaningful looks, hesitant glances, and unresolved impressions. Even the issues of how the settlers interacted with the ""naturals"" was stilted. Did anyone ever thank/repay the naturals for all the food??

I am not adverse to slow-paced, ""poetic"" films -- Kurosawa's Dreams, and The Fast Runner (Atarnajut), for instance, are glacially paced, but beautiful, intriguing films. I turned on the subtitles (in the extended cut DVD) to read some of the barely audible voice-over whisperings of the characters' internal thoughts -- godawful trite dreck, like a 6th-grader's musings.Mallilck needs to hire a real writer/poet to make this novelistic technique work. And cut back on the repetitious scenes of Pocahontas worshipfully twirling around in the grass like a stoned hippy chick, while the overbearing music score manages to be both annoying and monotonous.I feel sorry for viewers seduced into thinking this unstructured, meandering, undramatic film is profoundly avant-garde and bohemian while they struggle to keep from snoring.",The New World

It never resorts to flashing epic clichés but goes about the story in a more realistic and romantic approach. To put it bluntly the film was like a epic poem come to life on screen. Klicher is a godsend to this movie. She is the guiding light of this amazing story. Just her meer presence was enough to take your breath away. And at the end I was very much moved by her performance and the choice that her character chooses at the end of the film. She reflected on her love with John Smith and I think that she saw the light that her love for her was nothing meerly but childhood love and she was ready to move on. And also I think that she see's through John Smith's BS and she sees everything she truly needs is right in front of her with her son. John Horner's score was beautiful. Its not the traditional score that epics have. It felt at times like a opera. Its very interesting that he composed the score and Malik cut around it, traditionally its the other way around. This will be 2005 love or hate it film. I guess I can sort of see why so many people are disappointed or hate it because its really not made for the traditional movie goers.",The New World

And yet, I must say that the movie couldn't be better! The music is calm and yet powerful. It's ideally suited to the whole film. What also stunned me was the way things were showed. By things I mean everything - nature, trees, grass, small things; things we might consider unimportant. Many are bore to the foreground. The acting was to a very high level and was a pleasure to see these actors on the screen. When the film finished I remained in my chair. But actually I wasn't thinking of anything, I was feeling.

373,joelduplessis,And let's end with one more shot of that rock in the creek while the orchestra warms up some more.,3,21 January 2006,"I heard somewhere that The New World was going to explode some of the myths surrounding John Smith and Pocahontas. It would inject the story with new vibrancy and excitement, while paying careful attention to historical accuracy. Boy, was I misinformed.The New World is a pretty film. There are lots of beautiful sequences of rocks and streams and trees and grass (fuzzy grass, prickly grass, green grass, brown grass, lots of grass). Now and then, some humans intrude, but they usually don't say or do anything, other than dance and frolic in the grass. When they do speak, it's off-screen, so you can't be sure whether they're actually talking or just thinking. But don't worry too much that their dialogue will interrupt the mesmerizing bird sounds and water noise -- only rarely do they finish an entire sentence longer than three words. Mostly, the characters say, or perhaps think, scintillating repartee like: ""He is a tree."" ""Who are you?"" ""I like grass.""You know you've arrived at an exciting part when the incessant orchestral soundtrack wells to a crescendo. It's very lovely and soothing, like the sound of a bathtub running in the next room. With about as much direction and discernible melody. Have you ever listened to a string ensemble warming up? It's slightly discordant, but pretty-sounding nonetheless. The New World let's you enjoy that nondescript droning for an entire feature length film!In sum, the set was amazing, the cinematography breathtaking, and Colin Farrell's unchanging puppy dog expression endearing (to a point). But it felt like the longest movie I have ever sat through. And it certainly did not debunk any myths about Powhatan-English encounter. It's still a love story between a teen-aged ""noble savage"" princess drawn by helpless love to throw herself upon a thoughtful, brave, and kind American and save his life (rather than, as current scholarship suggests, a nine year old daughter of a powerful king, instructed by her father to symbolically intercede for the arrogant and cruel Englishman so that Powhatan could demonstrate not only his power to execute, but also his capacity to show mercy). Don't watch this, unless you bring your yoga mat.",The New World
374,gilko,"Often beautiful, very slow and obtuse",2,6 December 2005,"This film really should be caused ""Pocahontas"" but Disney took that name. While the film is beautifully photographed, with what seems like hours of flowing water and sun through the tree shots, the story and the editing almost completely hides what is going on in the story. In fact some of the editing makes the film look like a rough cut with black slugs filling in for missing scenes.What little dialog there is presented like an interior monologue (so ""boomy"" it is hard to hear what is being said); much is in Indian (they are called ""naturals"" to be P.C.)language with perhaps 8 subtitles during the TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS; when you can hear the dialog many of the actors speak so quickly and in such strong dialects it might as well be in Greek.When they are not yelling and slobbering at the camera the actors wander around with no expression so you can apply any feeling you care to their characters.The film also seems to have been a mystery to Colin Farrell who joins Tom Cruise in the area of remaining firmly in the 21st century while slogging through the 17th century like some out of place hippie in feathers and leather clothes and a lot of dirt.",The New World
375,efeedor1,"New World, Old Story",6,27 January 2007,"I imagine that Terrence Malick, like his characters in ""The New World,"" takes pleasure in running frenetically about in new, beautiful places; he gropes and pets and feels all that is around him, taking it all in with one fresh, innocent gasp. His new film is photographed in his trademark sumptuousness, and when Europeans accustomed to castles see straw huts in meadows and Native Americans accustomed to straw huts see castles in metropoli, you inhale that same rich breath. The anthropological fascination that Malick channels into the first brushes between the two peoples is astounding. One sequence in particular  John Smith's taste of life among the ""savages"" and his first encounter with Pocahontas  is, perhaps, the movie's emotional high point. Anyone who can remember summers at the lake or simply has a penchant to frolic about in fields is enticed, and the courtship between the two lovers  demonstrated through touch more than talk  is lovely to the point of being affecting; it is like flowers ripening in the springtime. Unfortunately, the blossoms only open so much.The movie remains a pretty thing to look at  a pictorial representation of the past the way that ""2001"" was of the future  but from there on the dramatics become wobbly. For two more hours, the plot revolves around the couple trying to regain that initial high, and when their relationship doesn't deliver, neither does the film. The majestic Wagner overture, which sets off the tone of wonderment with such promise, seems like a cheat. Smith (Colin Farrell) returns to the Jamestown settlement, the only ugly setting in the entire movie. His fellow colonists are all whiney, belligerent cockneys who  until the later, spontaneous appearance of Christian Bale  are almost entirely indistinguishable from one another. They do, however, provide a needed break from the monotonous, poetic soliloquies that Smith and his Indian princess (Q'Orianka Kilcher) deliver on the voice over track. Some of their gentle, archaic monologues are helpful in establishing the romantic souls of their sayers; they necessarily explicate the differing points of view had by the two peoples. But when Pocahontas is exiled to the white men  whose outpost is now, thanks to the natives, just as pretty as the rest of the production design  and when she seeks out Smith beforehand, we are dismayed to discover that these muffled trifles are all that is exchanged between the lovers in person as well. That is the extent of the central relationship of the entire movie: whispered sweet nothings.To match the banality of their old-fashioned dialogue, the principals play as stiff, wide-eyed romantics who have a lust for beauty, but are otherwise hollow. Newcomer Kilcher is able to convey interior pathos rather well, but she is about the only person in this film who the director allows to emote; Colin Farrell, who actually can act, is stiff as a board for the supposedly rebellious professional soldier. His eyes are puffy, and his mouth, behind unkempt facial hair, perpetually droops. When the focus shifts from him to his girl, his comatose nature is somewhat excused: he's a warrior-poet but also a wanderer; he should've never let her love him. The storyline is nothing more than the soap opera of a man who cannot commit and his weepy paramour who'll nevertheless keep her darling's place set at the dinner table.After Smith embarks to find the Northwest Passage, he has his broken-hearted girl notified that he has drowned. The grieving Pocahontas is Anglicized, baptized and rechristened as Rebecca (her birth name is, as I recall, never given during the film  probably so that people don't think this is just a rehash of the Walt Disney cartoon). John Rolfe's (Christian Bale) subsequent courtship with her has some of the sweetness that came with her early days with her previous John, but the latter affair pans out to be as formal as a business luncheon. Bale's role at least proves that the movie's premise is not to show that every Englishman/Westerner is just some ill-mannered invader unworthy of the Native Americans' enlightened lifestyle. For better or for worse, he's but a good, bland man.Malick never asks the question of whether white man should have ever stepped foot in this country. The closest he comes to addressing this is the contrast between the early, floundering colony  which consists basically of forlorn hay huts lopped on goopy, barren mud  and the paradisiacal native enclave. But Jamestown gets a make-over half-way through when new settlers prosper and beautify the place. And Malick makes Jacobean England  the invaders' home turf  in its own way as attractive as virginal Virginia. The only sources of sorrow are unrequited love and failed crops; the specter of imperialism is barely hinted at. Even Rebecca née Pocahontas doesn't seem upset about her forced expatriation from the world she was reared in; any possible commentary that her unique situation should offer is bizarrely omitted.It only seems right that Malick doesn't  and perhaps can't  make any species of political statement. He's much too busy gallivanting through the scenery and noticing again, for the first time, how lovely it all looks.",The New World
376,klayton-15801,History Through Film Review,6,30 August 2018,"I a first watching this movie in class to learn not only the history behind it, but also the history of film making. One of the main reasons we chose this movie is because of the director Terrence Malick. The movie begins with the English colonists coming to the Americas. Pocahontas meets John Smith and they both fall in love with each other. Lots of stuff happens. John Smith lives with Native 
Americans for a while and learns some of their way later to return to Jamestown to be elected leader. When the settlers learn about his relationship, they turn against him. This also happens to Pocahontas, however she was banished from her family and village. John Smith dies. She begins to live life with the settlements and meets John Ralph. Ralph falls in love and asks her to marry him. They end up married in England only to have John Smith still be alive and Pocahontas still in love with him. They get back together and live happily ever after until she dies which isn't portrayed in the movie. The film making was beautiful. Malick uses certain camera angles and camera paths to add effect to the movie. The lack of fighting along with John Smith not being dead make me question the historical accuracy. We're taught in school that the Natives Americans and the settlers didn't get along as much as they were portrayed in the movie to do so. The way that Malick did his thing reminds me of movies of videos featuring lots of nature on its own. There were close ups of the river or somebody swimming which made you feel in the scene. I liked how the music added effect to the feeling. I did not like how slow it seemed to go and how much it seemed like it dragged some parts out. Overall I liked the movie. It was a beautiful example of what great film making looks like. It told a great story that seemed for the most part pretty accurate.",The New World
377,jamefitz,The audience is going to be crying.,5,30 August 2018,"I watched this movie because it has historical value. I feel that this story should be told the exact way it was. Altogether the film maker is trying to get the point of the migration from England to the new world. I feel he was also trying to get across everything wrong that we did in the past, so it may not happen again. The actors had limited wardrobe and acting had to be real. Examples as crying, or fighting, or yelling, or anger. There was a lot about this movie and it's historical accuracy that I found that could have been very very wrong. Simply because we have no first hand proof to confirm many of the things that happened. I can't really think of any movies that I could relate this too. Or make a connection with because in all honesty I don't watch older movies.
I really did enjoy how it portrayed the Indians by being fascinated with all of the Englishmen weapons, tools, and culture. I enjoyed how well they portrayed many of the fights being because of the Englishmen and what they wanted to take.

379,japs,A Visual Poem,10,30 January 2006,"I have seen all Malick's film and it is still too early to say whether it is his best movie, it is certainly a contender.The film worked its magic on me. I sat back and fell into Malick's milieu. The imagery was stunning. But it was far more than a pretty film. The courtship scene was protracted, but all the more effective because of it. His elliptical narrative and his preoccupation with touch coupled with the characters short flashbacks worked wonderfully. The subtext of the film (and most of his films to be honest) about civilised man's destructive approach to the world around him, was there but he didn't hit the viewer over the head with it - a la Oliver Stone. After seeing the movie I felt a mixture emotions. Firstly I felt invigorated by having seen an artist working at the peak of his powers bring a vision to life. He appeared to have complete control over the film and New Line seem to have given him a carte blanche. with it. However I was aware that this kind of film - with Hollywood's dwindling profits will be the first to go. The studios have new problems to encounter - see Soderbergh's 'Bubble' - and films that have artistic value but don't maximise profits and demographics won't, I feel, get made. The New World is not a popcorn movie. Yet the amount of criticism levelled against it because it doesn't conform to today's dominant idiom within film-making (the quick-cut, rock soundtrack, no-brainer), seems quite pathetic. It seems mediocrity is the king, deified to such a degree that anything that doesn't fall within its parameters must be ridiculed. Yes the film's NARRATIVE is slow, because it isn't a narrative-based film. It is a cinematic poem. And like a poem it employs, at times, repetition and mood rather than story.If you think Armageddon was great, there is nothing for you here. Leave it (and me) alone. For the rest of us The New World is art of the highest order. Watch. Enjoy.",The New World

Terrence Malick should be stripped of his director's beret, and reduced to filming programs for the WB or UPN. Approximately two hours and 20 minutes of the principal actors basically staring at each other in abject silence with hanged-dog looks on their faces, just about had me heading for the exit. The story line was so thin, it's obvious why Malick took the writing credit as opposed to spending a little bit of production money on a decent screen play. I must say, the cinematography, locations, set design, and costuming were first rate. However, having the ""naturals"" dancing around like inquisitive apes for the first part of the picture was a low blow to the integrity of native Americans, at the cost of cheap thrills for the audience. Yes, most Americans DO want entertainment, not Malick's overindulgent, self aggrandizing wet dreams.

It's a love story that challenges you instead of just leaving you warm and snug.Be prepared to dig in and buy in to an immersing experience. The film is long and even slow at times. It is intentional in its pacing, not haphazard. There were themes of being in a place, of experiencing a place and of waiting that some people may find frustrating. But I'd say the experience is one worth having. It is also the kind of movie, like Master and Commander, that you may not find to have a neat, satisfying ending. This is not a neatly gift-wrapped package, it is, at least in part, a true story with the complications that brings; it feels like a segment of the time-line cut out and rolled out for you to explore rather than a story constructed to fit neatly into a one paragraph synopsis.",The New World
382,doyler232000,Malick's welcome return,10,18 April 2006,"From the opening shot of Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas standing in the tall grass, her arms stretched out to heaven in adoration, we know we are in Malick territory. The opening sequence of the film, almost dialog free, is trade mark Malick. We see images of an idyllic paradise on earth, native children swimming in the sea and the adults peacefully co-existing with nature. As the European ships make their appearance,Malick shows the bewilderment of the natives at the sight of such alien crafts. James Horner's minimalist score superbly builds up the sense of awe. The New World marks Terrence Malick return after 1998's The Thin Red Line. Set in Virginia in 1607, It tells the story of Sir Walter Raleigh(Christopher Plummer)'s expedition to colonize America. On the ship is rebellious soldier of fortune Jonh Smith(an impressively under-played Colin Farrel).On the first hour of the film, Smith is captured by the natives and encounters Pocahontas, the young daughter of a chieftain.They instantly make a connection which will affect the fate of both natives and settlers. Performances are generally excellent, most notoriously newcomer Kilcher's, which perfectly conveys her character's innocence and sense of wonder, and Christian Bale's in a supporting role as the kindly tobacco farmer Jonh Rolfe. The Oscar Nominated photography is breathtaking and Malick's script and direction as poetic as ever. The pace of the film-as in all of Malick's films- is very slow, but it isn't really a defect as it is an element of Malick's style. This film didn't make a dent in the box-office but is surely destined for cult status. A must see.",The New World

385,jaj5zh,A good looking and disjointed film,3,22 April 2007,"My first clue that I was settling in for a dog of a historical drama was when Malick chose Mozart's Piano Concerto #23 for the romantic theme during scenes of John Smith and Pocahontas frolicking together. I never thought going into this film that the events would be portrayed in similar fashion to Disney's ""Pocahontas"". The fact that that music continued to be used as a device to tell us, ""Oh, they're feeling amorous again!"" cheapened the entire effect for me. Never mind that the music was composed a century and a half later and is beautiful in its own right, it was inappropriate and about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Hats off to a director that can make Mozart feel like that!The second major annoyance with the film was the mumbling of the characters and overuse of the voice-over. Midway through the movie, I no longer cared what they thought. How many times did Pocahontas ask, ""Who is he?"". Enough already.I knew going in that the English characters would have British accents, which is also historically inaccurate. The clipped speech patterns the Brits are known for now were not heard in during the years of King James or even with Elizabeth's reign. Malick could have traveled to nearby Tangier Island, Va., where generations have been isolated for many years, to hear a closer approximation of what the colonists would have sounded like. And then there was the matter of John Smith's prominent tattoo! I don't think so!Overall, I was greatly disappointed in this overly affected and confusing interpretation of the Jamestown settlement.",The New World

The plot has been done before, allowing for few surprises or turns and I found myself bored half-way through. Terrence Malicks appears to focus more on the natural side of The Americas, before Europeans arrived, and the result is a little hazy. With atmospheric music and random polarised shots of swamp land and forest, the whole thing seemed to be trying too hard to make an epic impression.One of the pluses from the movie is the performance from Q'Orianka Kilcher as the evergreen figure, Pocahontas. For such a young actress, she came across as very natural on screen, next to the big guns; Bale and Farrell. The sets were also very impressive, with a realistic creation of James Town, and the Indigenous villages providing a more life-like back drop for the film.Sadly, the action was just too slow to captivate me as a viewer, wishing to be entertained. The soundtrack was so low that it was difficult to follow dialogue, and I feel Malicks rather loses the effect of what is essentially, an age-old love film which is a shame, as all the ingredients where available for a sound picture. This, in my opinion, could have been so much better.",The New World
388,geoffcooper,A Painful Reminder of the Trouble With Imperialism,7,21 August 2008,"This picture is quite simply a gem in the aspect of cinematography. The way in which Malick crafts his shots throughout the film, making wonderful use of light and color, brings this epic story to life before our eyes. The powerful performances from Colin Farrel, Christian Bale, and the angelic Q'orianka Kilcher bring out strong emotional responses from the viewer. It is indeed a well written and well crafted piece of work.The most impressive angle on this film that I can see is the way in which the rich and beautiful culture of the Native Americans are depicted. Imagine a society without greed or fear. No struggles for power or acts of useless violence. A place where people have no concept of personal property because there is real equality, freedom and opportunity for all. An existence in which people share, love, and live in mutual respect for each other and nature. A truly classless civilization.We in the West, have no perception of what a society like this is. We are so busy with our addictions to wealth, power, and personal gain. It has been proved time and time again throughout history, that when a society such as the Native American's exists, it is not long before an imperialistic power will seize it and plunder it in the name of reform, betterment, or religion.This film is a painful reminder of the trouble with imperialism and the death and destruction that it brings. It shows us that the only truth is in love and understanding, and that despite an Establishment's attempt to replace freedom with false hope, natural freedom can never be changed or broken.",The New World
389,izzy_m,So Boring,2,25 February 2006,"Oh my goodness. I am not going to go as far as saying this is the worst movie of the last year but it is definitely the most boring, hands down. I mean it was so unnecessarily long. I am not sure what the director was on while shooting this. Maybe it was the script that made this movie so god-awfully boring. I saw no apparent climax and no apparent resolution. I saw the cartoon Pocahontas and I think that was far superior. ---------------------------------------------------- -----possible spoilers here on------------- Christian bale's role was insignificant and the letter he wrote to his son didn't really add to the movie. They have a son but we see him for such a short time that it makes me wonder why they even included him. Pocahontas marrying a white man already shows that she joined them or that she is distanced from her tribe.

393,mjmeditor,Possibly the best film ever made...,10,18 December 2005,"The New World is an extraordinary film. From start to finish, it gives the audience pleasure, sadness, drama, and adventure. 'This is a Terrence Malick film' one must keep in mind before viewing this picture. But however, this isn't very much the Malick you see in Badlands. It's the Malick you see in The Thin Red Line and partly Days of Heaven. Another thing about this film is that it's not a history lesson, nor a documentary; it's a piece of film that makes you an eyewitness to the encounter with the Englishmen and the Powhatan tribe that took place on the James River, Virginia in 1607. The dialogue is limited, and there are plenty of Voice overs, but once an audience sees the film, you realize that it doesn't need dialogue, because it's very self explanatory. That is also a Malick trait, but the trait of all traits is the cinematography is incredible. The acting is at its best as well.The direction is very similar to what an audience has seen in Days of Heaven, a story about 2 lovers leaving Chicago to work in a farm owned by a rich and dying farmer. It is on the other hand similar to The Thin Red Line, a story about the battle of the Guadalcanal in World War II. The first shot in The New World is a shot of a river, with Pocahontas (who is never called Pocahontas in the film) saying a prayer. After the opening credits, we have the river which pans to a shot of the 3 ships arriving. Next we have the Natives running up to the ships. Like The Thin Red Line, it starts out from the Natives point of view, and shows a ship coming through the ocean. Like all 3 of his films, transitions during scenes are either blackouts or a shot of a piece of nature. When Capt. John Smith is giving orders to everyone in the settlement, the scene ends with a shot of a river at night. As in Days of Heaven, it isn't shot with any blue skies.This film is not a history lesson. The audience is just an eyewitness to the events in Virginia 1607. The lack of dialogue makes you watch the events as they go on. Another thing Malick did is separate myth from reality. Most of the Pocahontas tale is mainly myth. A lot is unknown, and Terry makes his version come to screen in a way that you are watching. Not all the known story matches the film, for that reason. At the end sequence at the Rolfe Plantations in England, it cuts back to Tommocco, an Indian sent back to England with Pocahontas by Chief Powhatan walking in the streets of London in his native clothes. He does not speak, and no one else is there, just him alone. It represents the loneliness he feels, being away from his native land. Also the way Malick makes the Natives look like a magical tribe that have been living in their land for a very long time can refer to his other films that use that same quality, and it also contributes to the historical drama, which is that the English took that away from the Natives.There is hardly dialogue in the film. The film speaks for itself. When he wants you to feel the characters emotion, he will use a voice over. This way, at least I feel, that you get a stronger feeling of the characters personal perspective on the situation. There are pans of the fields that Pocahontas and John Rolfe are working in towards the end of the film. The same things happen in Days of Heaven. These ones in The New World sometimes go into a pan of the fort too, during what was called The Starving Time. It will do a silent pan around showing the settlers dying and working in poor condition which definitely speaks for itself. The battle sequence with the Natives and Settlers show the same beautiful silence. There aren't voice overs in the battle sequence, but the feeling and reactions from the camera should get the sense of what is going on and why the scene is set like that.The acting is at its best too. Q'orianka Kilcher, new actress who plays Pocahontas, was just beautiful in this portraying Pocahontas. The name Pocahontas means, 'playful one' which is who she really was. It's also how the actress portrayed her character. She really created emotion, and at the same time she could be playful and play around with John Smith and John Rolfe as well. Christian Bale was surprisingly in it a lot, considering how much Plummer and Studi were cut. The story did revolve around Pocahontas and the 2 men that were drawn between her though, so it did focus on Kilcher, Bale, and Farrell. Bale was excellent, one of the best performances I have personally seen. Farrell was also great. Most may not like him in general or think he was not right for this role. Malick did select him though because his character was perfectly fit for his specific personality which is an ambitious and adventurous man. Overall, this acting was incredible as was this film.",The New World

Who would not only help out, but come along for the journey, even when they didn't have to? That is the question of this film. When you see a bird in the sky, without a flock, you can ask how did the bird with its flock wish to fly off on it's own.I'm always somewhat shocked after seeing a Malick film. When something is truly what people tend to call original, it has this ability to destroy your foundations. Every part of this film is fundamentally new for cinema. From the disciplined beauty of the photography, the pacing of the film's story, and just the nimbleness with which Malick creates depth and character, space and devastating emotions, will make you rethink everything about how you thought they should come about.Malick is hard to talk about. Better to just watch his films, look through the eyes of his mysterious characters, and try to wonder about the world like they all wonder, think like they all think, and care like they care.The New World is a fine and devastating work of art.",The New World
395,KrisDemeanoR,"""Obsession"" by Terrence Malick",3,23 January 2006,"I, like many others, have read the astounding reviews laid upon Terrence Malick's new film ""The New World."" US Weekly calls it""Oscar-worthy""; even more trusted critics such as Richard Roeper have called it ""One of the best movies of the year . . . a work of great passion and visual poetry"" while Richard Corliss of Time Magazine has declared ""Anyone who has keen eyes will surely go soaring and crashing with the lovers lost in Malick's exotic, erotic new world."" We are independent-thinking movie-goers, yet when we do our research and see reviews such as these, we are right to assume that the film is at least worthy of a theater viewing. Surely, with reviews like this, we can safely assume that it, at the very least, won't be a waste of our time.However, while the numerous glowing reviews of Terrence Malick's latest foray onto the big screen mainly tell us why we must go see this film, they also indirectly tell us something far more important and useful: that critics are sometimes so misaligned with the tastes of the general public that they unwittingly guide them to a film that breaks their pocketbooks as well as their patience.Let me explain.I was one of the people that read the reviews of those I trusted, and decided to go to see the film based on their tastes and expertise. After all, the film starred Colin Farrell (whose career hasn't taken a right turn since Minority Report) and was directed by Terence Malick (who had directed the similarly overrated The Thin Red Line); I needed a little extra assurance that I wasn't walking into another Malick-induced coma. I got the assurance, and went to Grauman's Chinese on Saturday night to give both artists a fair shot at my good graces. . . .At its bare bones, The New World recounts the English arrival in Virginia circa 1607 and how Captain John Smith (played by Colin Farrell) is capured by the ""naturals,"" only to be saved from death by the young, beautiful Pocahontas (played by Q'orianka Kilcher). They fall in love, through a series of events she is taken in by the English, and she is eventually taken back to England.Even though the film pushes the three-hour mark, this is all you need to know; many will go into this film already knowing the general story, which is definitely to their advantage, for you won't be able to decipher much more than this basic outline over the course of the film anyways.Terrence Malick's The New World is a long, hapharzardly edited, disjointed, syrupy, narratively-vacant, nature-laden snoozefest that fails to broaden the mind or rouse the emotions on any level. Our director simply can't seem to get enough of filming our principals frollicking through the forest through their barely audible whispery interior monologues, which seems to take up about a third of the film. Smith and Pocahontas look at each other lovingly by a river as her breathy voice-over beginscut to a tree swaying in the windcut to the rivercut to a birdcut to her neck. These voice-overs and woodsy love montages occur so often that the film frequently plays like an obscenely long Calvin Klein Obsession commercial. This might have been negligible had there been some redeeming qualities to the other parts of the film.For example, when we get a reprieve from the empty love story and get back to camp, we can barely understand the English adventurers through their thick English accents. Were they in danger? Were they starving? Why was that guy just shot? Had I understood what exactly they were saying, it might have added some much-needed depth and direction to the storyline, but since it doesn't we're left to guess for ourselves (which we shouldn't have to do, by the way). Somehow, I think that even people watching this movie in England were asking each other, ""What the bloody hell did that guy just say?"" The film also has a habit of jumping from event to event without telling how or why we got there. Once again, the fact that I could barely hear what people were saying I'm sure played an integral part in this, but it eventually seemed as if Malick had no idea what story he was telling. How can we find our way through a film if it doesn't look like even the director could? This is all very unfortuante for the actors, because Malick has managed to amass a very talented cast. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, in her feature debut, emodies the innocence, playfulness, and beauty of Pocahontas, and is thoroughly watchable. Christian Bale is a fully capable young actor, and yet even his character must resort to those insufferable, stale voiceovers. Colin Farrell has the expressions and non-verbal acting elements down, yet for reasons still unknown to this movie-goer, he decides to keep his Irish accent for his portrayal of an undoubtedly English John Smith, which was just downright annoying. The soul of the film is Kilcher, whose performance most escapes the mutlitude of flaws that pervade this film. If there is a ""saving grace"" for this film, it is her.Bottom line: There is an audience for this film. I would say that if you were able to follow and enjoy The Thin Red Line, then go ahead and give it a shot. Some people love Terrence Malick, and those people should in turn love this movie. However, if you're one of those strange people who needs to understand what's going on and some pretty nature shots just isn't going to cut it, for the love of God, stay away from this movie. This film is just not in the same league as Match Point, Brokeback Mountain, or Good Night, and Good Luck.If you don't trust me, trust the three couples that trickled out of the theater over the course of the first 1.5 hours.",The New World
396,Dean_Sayers,Just another love story,6,25 January 2006,"Though the movie is not bad by any means, it could have been easily set in fifty other historical situations and came out with the same effect. The love story leaves the viewer bored and the seeming emotionlessness of the characters creates a sense that the two main actors didn't take their roles seriously (Pocahontas certainly seemed emotional until a certain point, while Smith seemed to feel as if she could have been any harlot he could have had on the streets of London). Bale does seem compassionate but also seems to be a little apathetic. The lack of dialogue and explanation leaves the viewer wondering both why the characters acted how they did and at times what even happened. The soundtrack is generic, bland, unmemorable and sometimes out of place, which would not be such an offense if the movie had not had such a focus on emotion and surrealism.Historical inaccuracies are not excessive, but the portrayal of the natives is downright offensive - jumping around and using war cries at inappropriate times as if to portray them as monkeys. Again, the lack of explanation makes it appear as if the natives did not actually help the settlers through the winter or help them with their crops. The shift from downright militancy between the groups to a leader allowing himself to be taken across the sea with only one of his tribesmen is unexplained, as well.The movie is not without positive aspects, however. The scenery is beautiful and historically accurate, though some of the settings are unexplained in the context of the plot (i.e. it is unexplained why certain people went / lived here or there). The directing is dynamic and generally flows nicely together, and John Smith's communal attitude toward his direction of the colony is accurately portrayed.I gave the movie a '6' because it was regularly confusing, sometimes drawn out with unnecessary scenes, the soundtrack was pedestrian, the movie didn't make you care as much for the characters as you should have been able to and the portrayal of the natives was surprisingly condescending.I would suggest seeing this movie if you want to see a love story and are fairly interested in Jamestown and Pocahontas, but be warned that the historical content basically stops halfway through where the characters' dull emotions start to take the stage.",The New World

401,tidwell85,We can't all be dreamers.,8,6 September 2015,"Captain John Smith and his men are weary, starving, and outnumbered during the early days of Jamestown, but Smith has more on his mind than survival. He also seems uninterested in higher walls and deeper mines, yet the men insist that he preside over the colony. While his superiors believe he has the makings of a great leader, I feel it's the dreamer, not the leader, in Smith that gets Pocahontas' attention. So the well-known legend goes that she throws herself on his lap and insists his life be spared at the moment her tribe is about to execute him. I'd say the rest is history, but as far as Smith and Pocahontas are concerned the rest is fiction. Pocahontas may have in fact pardoned him from execution, but in real life they were never a couple. No matter, though. We like the story of Pocahontas and John Smith sharing something original and wondrous, teaching each other the ways of the East and the West, becoming one. Suppose our nation had evolved that way.The New World wants us to suppose that the two of them may have been in love, or at least dreamed that they were for a time. Or maybe they both just dreamed, but dreamed together. It struck me how right Malick was for this story, because of his ability to evoke wonder. He reminded me that the founding of Jamestown, while grotesque for the founders, must have been magical for some of the Powhatan tribe. So magical that of course it was a ten year old girl who was best able to really believe it, and to keep up with it. The rest could only gawk, and commence killing each other as they struggled to grasp what was going on.There is a brief scene where Smith invites a tribesman into the fort to let him look around. As the warrior wanders about, the colonists ready their weapons. But Smith assures them that he's harmless. 'Mad,' he says. The Powhatan indeed has a crazed look in his eyes, but I questioned if he was in fact crazy. It could be that he simply displayed bewilderment commensurate with how astonishing the arrival of the English must have been. I certainly can only begin to imagine being a Powhatan and seeing massive sailing vessels emerge out of the mist. Were they floating islands? And what about the masts? Were they animal skins? What animal was so large that skinning it yielded an entire mast? And weapons from what sorts of trees did the English whittle rifles? What was armor made from? Silver tree bark? What did it feel like to run through a forest of of silver trees? And if the trees were silver, then what was the grass like, in that distant land they called England?For most of the English, though, discovering the Powhatans must have been a far less interesting experience, I daresay. The early settlers were workers hired to extract resources and create trading opportunity, not unlike ditch diggers paid by a big box corporation at the outskirts of a suburb. What interests me is the rift in perspective between the one who's there with a specific mission in mind, and the other who was there already, and is now, all too suddenly, witnessing the arrival of aliens more great and terrible than the imagination could have prepared them for.So it was the Indians, not the settlers, whose imaginations were open-ended. That's why Pocahontas played the part she did in American and English history. Being a ten year old princess, she was simply the most open to the English not as a business partner or a threat, but a culture, a people, a person because it is our awareness that allows us to dream. I recently read an article about the regrets of the dying. According to the nurse who recorded the most common laments, the number one regret of patients was that they lived the life expected of them, not a life true to their self. Expectations can enhance, but also cloud experience because subjectivity is both powerful and precarious. The motivations we carry around with us can be our friend or our enemy. For the English, motivation was a blinder.Maybe this belief of mine is why I tend to live spontaneously. Planning isn't a big part of my life. But I find that my experiences are most vivid when I don't know what's coming next. Maybe this is why vacations are stressful for the parents, magical for the children. Controlling what came next was Smith's job, and it distracted him so much that he failed to see what he had.So what did he have, other than a lucrative investment? In my opinion, the English had an opportunity to create something truly new. Not a new version of England, but an original nation. They had an ancient civilization there to compliment their own. They had the potential to grow and evolve with the Indians the way that differing tribes had learned to coexist in flux with one another over centuries. Had both sides, the natives and the aliens, just been able to keep their fear, greed, and pride in check, the two cultures might have found themselves in love with one another. They might have seen that potential.Pocahontas saw it, embraced it, and lived what I imagine to be the the greatest experience life has to offer: the waking dream. And I believe she lived that dream for the rest of her life. I think that John Smith embraced it, too, if only for a minute. He soon woke up, though, and got back to securing the future of the English stronghold. After all, that's why he was there to begin with. We can't all be dreamers, all the time.",The New World

There are many things wrong with it, but I will try and focus on the most relevant ones. First of all, the props while being contemporary looks cheap which lower the overall appearance. The story would fit a 40 minute TV-episode and yet the movie is 150 minutes. The casting is also very questionable. The acting of Q'orianka Kilcher and Colin Farrell is extremely bad and the chemistry between the two is none existing. If they where brother and sister in real life, the kissing scenes would probably be less awkward. If anything good should be said, it would be that Christian Bale does a solid effort as ""John Rolfe"" but once he appears, it's too late to save the movie from being an absolute failure.Some people might be fooled by the beautiful scenery, the classical music and the low tempo.

You have two amazing actors in Colin Farrell and Christian Bale and they were woefully under-used. I know the story of John Smith and Pocohontas and I was still lost a few times in the story. Hearing so many good reviews about this movie reminds me of all the so called ""art critics"" who will give the most glowing reviews of the crappiest artwork because someone, somewhere told them they should. So rather than using their own eyes, they give the review expected of them. So yes, if you asked me was this movie beautiful I would respond yes, however a movie is supposed to tell a story, you are supposed to get a feel for the characters, but without the dialog this one just falls short.",The New World
408,rockyhorror-1,Beautiful film making . . . but not for everyone,8,22 January 2006,"Halfway through Terence Malick's The New World, the Powhatan princess referred to as Matoaka (never, thankfully, by the misnomer Pocahontas) arrives at the encampment of the English settlers in the dead of night, to warn the then-president, John Smith (played here by Colin Farrel) that her father, Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg), is preparing to attack them. She asks him, simply , to ""Come away"". After having seen what we've seen already, we know what she is asking him to do. And we are begging him to do it. But he can't. It's simply too late for him.Whether or not any of the events depicted in Malick's New World actually happened in real life as they are depicted in this film is beside the point. I personally have read a fair amount of historical and anthropological lit on early colonial Virginia, and sure, I'm a little annoyed that Malick opted to portray Smith's near-death experience at the hands of Powhatan, and his fabled (and doubtlessly fabricated) romance with his favorite daughter, when neither of these things actually happened in real life. Malick isn't as interested in historical accuracy as he is in historical truth (and yes, there is a difference). The land the English arrived in was an unspoiled eden, at least by what they certainly knew. Thirty years later, it was ruined, and the Powhatans were driven from their land. We see this happen as it truly did: eventually. No one is burdened with historical foreshadowing here. When the Indians first sight the ships, they couldn't possibly know that this means the end for them, and the beginning for Us. And they don't. It's that authentic. Instead, they, and we, feel excitement. In a breathtaking opening sequence scored by James Horner with ample help from Wagner, we are given what has to be a glimpse through some time portal, into the actual moments when Algonquin natives first sighted the three Ships of the Virginia Company Charter. Sound and sight combine beautifully (the film is filmed using natural light, as far as I know) to render a indescribably gorgeous montage, unlike anything I've ever seen in the cinema. It MUST have been like that. When the English go exploring soon after they land and encounter a party of Powhatan, Malick gives us a strange, disturbing, and yet joyous vision of this first encounter. The natives sniff and touch the aliens while the English stand stock still, obviously bewildered and terrified. Jesus, Malick. How did you do it?Malick has the natives, and especially Pocahontas (brillaint, beautiful, and passionate Q'orianka Kilcher) move and speak in the manner of the animals that inhabit the region. The warriors strut and caw like male birds, and Pocahontas dances through the fields like a leaping doe. These people do not move,speak, or act at all like Western men and women. We really believe that they have existed, removed from our civilization, for time out of mind. They are other, and it is beautiful to see. Malick contrasts the beauty and harmony of the Powhatan capital with the desolate grimness of Jamestown Fort, which Smith returns to after a sojourn with the natives. Unlike the idyllic world of the Algonquin, the settlers have proved themselves to be arrogant, greedy, and cruel. In the end, Powhatan decides he must act for the good of his people and plans to exterminate the English. Pocahontas, blinded by her love for Smith, goes to warn HIM. Not the colonists. She begs him to come away, back with her to a better place than any he can ever know with the Europeans. He refuses, because he cannot bring himself to give up the men he has been elected to lead to death. It is a stoic choice, but a fatal one, for both Pocahontas and her people. The Powhatan attack and are brutally thwarted (among the casualties is Pocahontas' beloved brother). Pocahontas is banished to the Patawomeck tribe, whose chief sells her to the English for a copper kettle. Told Smith is dead, she wanders about the fort desolate, and is slowly anglicized, eventually marrying a kind new settler, John Rolfe (an endearing Christian Bale) and bearing him a son. Malick doesn't so much tell us all this through conventional narrative as SHOW us. There is no point followed by point here. He lets it happen, and through achingly beautiful imagery, shows us how it FEELS. Yes, if you're in the wrong mood, the continuous shots of green canopies and flocks of birds blooming across the sky may be a bit much. Some parts may be confusing, especially toward the end. And the script seems, at times, to be non-existent, which is usually alright if you have the patience, but is trying at points. Sometimes, we wish they would SAY more, though this is usually made up for by impressive non-verbal acting by all parties. Sticklers for complete historical accuracy will be disappointed, but they should be advised to keep an open mind: the truth is essentially here. There was a land once, populated sparsely by a people who lived in harmony with the earth, if not always with each other. It was taken from them slowly but surely, and turned into something completely unrecognizable. Kilcher's Matoaka is Malick's chosen personification of America Unspoiled, once leaping about nimbly as one with the tall grass, then corseted, roughly clothed, and presented as a trophy to a foreign people. She opened her arms willingly and without guile to help a stranger in need. She was repaid with despair and grief, and was remade in someone else's image, to suit someone Else's' ways. It's all here, and beautiful , joyous, and terrible to watch. We wish we had come away with Pocahontas. Highly recommended for those with patience and an interest.",The New World
409,almajo,The piece of a true artist,10,21 January 2006,"I remember the vivid discussion that took place back in 1998, when Spielberg came out with the shocking ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Malick showed up again on the film-making surface after an odd 20 years by making ""The Thin Red Line"". What you have to understand is that, exclaiming the heated conversations eight years ago, there is a fundamental difference in the philosophy of making movies for the two.Whereas Spielberg is all about excitement and action, Malick is filmed poetry. Dialogue is limited to a certain extent. All that counts is the visual impression and the feelings it leaves you with. Malick is a director who makes you think, he virtually forces you to it. The way he portrays nature and its relationship towards us humans (and vice versa) is unbelievably stunning. The theatre was all quiet as if a hidden force had taken all their breath away. Awesome.Just like the way the old painting masters stunned the artistic world with their craft hundreds of years ago, Malick steers the art of movie-making in his very own direction.One can only admire his will to release films that go against the commercial stream of Hollywood. It is indeed fascinating that there are still moviegoers out there that appreciate quality and don't mind sitting in the theatre for 2 1/2 hours. I usually am under the impression that we're too much conditioned to the 100 minutes-movie nowadays and that effects and flat dialogue are destroying the art completely. We're sold for dumb. Luckily enough, the theatre I was in was almost sold out, but the average age as well as the intellectual standard was probably slightly higher than among the masses who went to see the sequel to ""Underworld"" the same evening.As for ""The New World"", Malick continues where he left us with James Caviezel's character in ""The Thin Red Line"". The connection is undoubtedly there. Colin Farrell, for once in a very quiet role, plays the troubled observer, the twisted conqueror of a new, unknown world and soon finds himself torn between the demands of his previous life and the chances of creating a new one and starting from scratch on the American continent. Yes, I'm usually not the biggest Farrell fan, but it's all in his sad eyes and tormented facial expressions. I think his talent just got wasted in the past years and I congratulate him for being able to break out of his stereotypical and flat tough guy image.Q'Orianka Kilcher is just plain astonishing. You could never tell that she was only 15 when the movie was shot. Her innocence and easiness is beautifully captured on screen and she fits the part perfectly. But the same goes for the entire cast, very good choice overall.I can't tell whether the historical background is depicted precisely enough. 400 years have passed and its certainly impossible to get it all straight. Therefore, I won't get into the discussion about the Native's looks or the English slur of that time. What I liked, however, is the last fourth of the movie and the juxtaposition of the New World vs. the Old World. What a weird scene that must've been, having Natives running around in English gardens. Priceless.Hopefully, Malick will let us see more of the story with a longer Director's cut or some bonus features on DVD (which I'll certainly buy). There were a couple of bits in the movie, especially towards the end, where time jumped way too fast and you really had to be attentive enough to grasp the story. And sometimes during the middle part, where Farrell and Kilcher are coming closer, there are a few repetitious scenes of them two out in the fields which could've been cut.Of course, this is not a perfect movie, but it comes very close to it. Maybe in a couple of decades, people will talk about it like they used to talk about a Van Gogh in an art gallery and say, ""See, that's a true Malick. Isn't it beautiful?"". He always lets you wait, but it's absolutely worth it.",The New World
410,knxg,A film of true depth and emotion,10,2 January 2006,"""The New World"" marks the triumphant return of director Terrence Malick, who after a seven year absence, has delivered one of the most impressive films of the past year. Though perhaps too long for his fans, Malick's hiatus was shorter than the 20 years that passed between 1978's ""Days of Heaven"" and 1998's ""The Thin Red Line"". Stylistically, his newest work is more of a continuation of the latter than of his seminal debut, ""Badlands"", and will likely arouse debate among followers of Malick's career. Although it is not very accessible to the average movie-goer, ""The New World"" carries tremendous rewards for viewers in the mood for something artistic.In terms of plot, ""The New World"" is a retelling of the tale of Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and John Smith (Colin Farrell). The film begins with the founding of Jamestown and continues through the Smith-Pocahontas relationship, the conflict between the settlers and the Powhatans, and Pocahontas' eventual marriage to John Rolfe (Christian Bale). However, this only scratches the surface of the film's focus.A deeper connection with nature is the unmistakable, driving force of the work. When John Smith first travels to the natives' camp, Malick depicts the Powhatans as a race that exists in harmony with their surroundings. After spending an extensive amount of time with the natives, Smith's return to the English settlement is visually jarring as the palette moves from lush greens to shades of brown. The English outpost is a fort sinking into the mud, confined by looming log walls. Its settlers are contrasted as a group that seeks to shut itself off from nature rather than embrace it. As such, they are unable to thrive in the new world.Pocahontas' eventual journey to England enhances this disparity. One of the film's most effective moments has a Powhatan, Opechancanough (Wes Studi), wandering through London's royal gardens. For him, the topiary designs are an artificial and alien ""forest"", illustrating how man has endeavored to recreate nature despite denying us an authentic experience.However, the film is not just a meditation on the natural world. Malick uses the love story of Pocahontas and Smith to explore the meeting of two very different civilizations. The fact that the title is ""The New World"" is but one indication that Malick has structured his film assuming viewers will automatically begin by identifying with the English. Nevertheless, Malick invests effort to convey the experiences of native life. The sequences he films are effective enough that viewers should find the experiences of the settlers to ultimately be the more foreign of the two.The meetings between the cultures evoke a range of emotions from wonder to fear. Also clear is the immense range of possible outcomes that existed during these first meetings. As the relations between the groups continue to break down, the results are tragic. The relationship between the characters of Smith and Pocahontas represent the idyllic middle ground between the civilizations. Their relationship is a demonstration of understanding that, unfortunately, seems lost on those around them.The film is also successful in its more tangible qualities. The editing is economical, skipping from moment to moment without a traditional set-up and conclusion for each scene. This is not jarring in the MTV sense, but thoughtful, and it allows Malick to include an impressive number of images and emotional moments into the running time. The film's music, scored by James Horner with contributions from Wagner, Mozart, and others, is evocative and complements the on-screen action. It is gratifying in particular that Horner clearly understands Malick's intentions and his serene touches are welcomed.The acting, cinematography, and production design is strong all around. However, newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher deserves special mention in her impressive performance as Pocahontas. Kilcher communicates a maturity well beyond her age (14 at the time of filming) with a youthful energy that brings her character alive. Kilcher eventually becomes the heart of the film and holds the screen well on her own. It is hard to say at this point what future Kilcher may have in other roles, but her performance in this film certainly is notable for its merits.The film has two minor flaws. First, Colin Farrell, in spite of delivering a strong performance, falls victim to ""Last Samurai-itis"" in that he is too recognizable a personality to truly disappear into the character of Smith. Secondly, the voice-overs used throughout the film are at times more pedestrian than insightful and may strike some viewers as pretentious. The strength of the voice-overs is that despite their weakness in content, they fit extremely well into the mood of the film. Combined with the lyrical pacing and editing, the voice overs prove that Malick is a director who can successfully realize poetry in a visual medium. As a result, these flaws do not diminish the emotional impact one feels by the time the end credits roll and to make too much of them would be a disservice to the recommendation that this film carries.Even among the handful of strong releases currently in theaters, ""The New World"" is a must-see. At its core, it is what cinema should be, a visual work of art that succeeds in arousing a strong emotional reaction. Viewers can rejoice over the fact that this film is seeing wide-release and one won't have to search far and wide for an obscure theater in order to experience Malick's vision.

411,warrengwonka,Massively pretentious impressionist film.,5,24 June 2013,"You know that a film is going to be massively pretentious when it is all water and river shots from the first note of Wagner's Ring to the time you would expect the Jamesmaidens to burst into song. However, I was warned by my daughter, who had seen it a few years ago, and did not expect any rousing action. It was a dream, rather, told with the jumpiness, incoherence, and lack of explication you get in one. Most of the dialog was buried by music, except for the voice overs. The show bragged about authenticity, but the Powhatan tribe historically mostly went about nude, according to the contemporary drawings of them. Even a Pre-Raphaelite-appearing painting of Pocahontas saving John Smith has a breast exposed by an off the shoulder outfit. But, for authenticity, I was at the Jamestown archaeological site just last week. The movie had it nailed. Malick did what he did exceedingly well, communicating with light, facial expressions, motion, requiring the viewer to give himself over to the atmosphere he wrought. The actors carried out his design beautifully. I let him work his will on me. Somewhat. I should like to also see a good drama of the history, perhaps the equivalent of the first season of the ""Rome"" series.He who needs a plot and dialog will be bored out of his skull. This show ain't nothing' like what he was expecting, and he will have wasted the rental fee. He would be like an Academy judge dealing with the Impressionist painters' submissions in Paris a century ago.",The New World
412,stelea,shocking,1,9 March 2006,"The only reason I can understand people would give this such a high rating is because they think that a slow pace and lack of dialogue means art and deep. It is not. As a film studies teacher i've watched films with slow narrative, in fact many of my favourite films are slowly paced but this is snail like and its all over the place. It jumps from some kind of documentary shot (hand held running through yet more grass) and ambient sound to another beautiful shot of our main female character wearing a Vivien Westwood cut dress (was it fashion for native Americans to wear off the shoulder animal skins or 3/4 crop tops in 1608) Its awful. Go watch crash, Capote, walk the line, sideways even batman begins for modern Hollywood, this is dreadful. Its like watching a 10hr Calvin Klein or Tommy advert, i kept expecting them to whisper ""eternity by Calvin Klein"". There are some great shots but then not as good as many other films that have a fully explored plot depth and content. If you want deep and sexual frustration watch lost in translation. I can't think of another film that tries to be such an epic and fails so bad maybe water world....but even that film is better. For all those that keep saying how this is an art film, maybe try peter Greenaway, if you want to be visually stunned especially prospero's books, or the cook the thief his wife and her lover. This isn't art; its Hollywood trying to do subtle, and it doesn't work. An art film is not just something that looks pretty it is supposed to challenge the audience, the only challenge here is to sit all the way through.",The New World

It was based on images and sounds, not words. However it could tell me what it wants to tell. I felt it under my skin through my veins. The story was familiar but i have never felt it like this before. In addition, it was not only a girl's story, but it was also a nation's, a ""new world""'s story. The people who came to see a war or some action were bored and most of audiences left the cinema before ending because film was quite slow and long. Acting was interesting, you will see that many people you do not expect very much will surprise you.

414,simon-875,Lovely to look at but so totally frustrating to watch,4,16 November 2006,"I wanted to like this movie. I am a huge fan of Badlands, one of my top three movies of all time . Days of Heaven gets easily into the top 20 but The New World is just beyond my capacity to endure. It looks fabulous... The scenery... the sets...but the dreary mumbling voice-overs that repeat endlessly and sometimes become almost inaudible. What is Colin Farrell saying half the time? This is miles from the Holly voice over in Badlands. The lack of structure to the narrative, the way it jump-cuts like Goddard and moves a a second through time and space to the detriment of our understanding is very irritating. Which is all a real shame as Terence Mallick is a genius - Bandlands proves that beyond doubt. I just cannot take to this latest work. Even the soundtrack, previously something of a Mallick trademark in it's stunning choice and application, is frankly boring in this movie. A million miles from his other work.

While some may find the length and lack of traditional dialogue off putting I feel that is what has turned this stunningly photographed motion picture into a visual poem. Malick has fashioned one visual feast after another using the wilds of Virginia and the civilization of England. We see the world through Nothing/Rebecca's eyes, all wondrous and expansive and the greatest gift she gives to Smith is the ability to appreciate the new world in which he has landed. While in the battle between the Native Americans and the English more colonist die than were actually in residence at the time, Malick can be forgiven for this one foray into Hollywood land type film-making. I do think that some judicious cutting might have made the film stronger but with visuals like this the choice of what to cut and what to leave in must have been excruciating. A beautiful gift, it will be a classic much like Lawrence of Arabia and its like.",The New World

417,wjmcpeak,A Small Voice for Historical Context,5,28 December 2005,"Any film is ultimately laced with the subjective desires of the director. And there has already been several reviews of The New World as a triumph of Malick's view of primitive America--and that the viewer should simply accept it as that. Being a big fan of Malick's Days of Heaven as one of the really great visual movies, I for one revel when somebody dips into history as movie subject matter and gives it the visual treatment it deserves to pull the viewer into the story. There is great visual worth to NW. But I also want to see the context upheld. If Malick was true to his subjectivity, he should have had enough objectivity to do the film either with veiled fictitious names--a typical Hollywood technique--or been more honest with the historical characters to protect the innocent--in this case both Captain John Smith and Pocahontas.He is wrong-headed about Smith--and it is probably to fit the scripted character to bad boy Colin Farrell that he commits this mortal sin of historical context! Smith was a seasoned military man--that little-boy-lost look of Farrell's doesn't make it! Smith had sustained many a close call, including ship wreck and many battles; he was severely wounded and subsequently sold into slavery; he beat to death his brutal Turkish owner and escaped far northeastern Turkey to return to Europe. He was contracted as a responsible military leader of the Jamestown colony, and he was extremely single-minded in this--though saddled with a wimpy, selfish colonial leadership that caused him to go over the line when called for. Smith was much more black and white than the colorful rebel Malick wishes to paint him as with Farrell as his brush. It is the old Hollywood story of infusing modern character to historical figures, and it will continue to be that way to sell tickets. But climbing inside a 16th-17th century mind reveals people often very alien to modern living--and that is a story too. Smith was unusual even for his time. His drive in life was adventure and quick action and the advancement he could collect. In and out of close calls so often, he probably had no time for sex!--indeed he seems to have been rather indifferent--a monk of war--rather asexual even----he never even married--and that is strange indeed for those times.On the other hand, there is Pocahontas--one of the truly unique people of American history--not only thoroughly engrossed with the invading European culture but with an adult's pathos to aid the inept Jamestown colonists. It should be made very plain that she was only ten years old at the time she met Smith in 1607--he was and always was known to her and in her own words as ""Father"". And as a little girl of incredible ability she had much more to do in trying to help and warn Jamestown than as she is depicted--a fifteen year old high school girl in primeval languor succumbing to hot and heavy Colin Farrell. If that isn't a slice of today's internet and e-mail soft porn pandering to the fantasies of middle-aged men (but, of course, back in the old days girls were married off as per-teens--so its alright?)! Hollywood has always beaten history into its own image with the one dictum always ever most--fill the seats--sex, violence, controversy drive the movie industry--the audience isn't interested in accuracy. Very true--but another epic love story of lust that was not?--come on!--how about a true story of unselfish love--too bad the idea that history can be more than fiction isn't tried more often!",The New World
418,GUzelac,A whole New World of film-making!,10,1 December 2005,"Terrence Malick's film, The New World,is a cinematic experience like no other. Set in Virginia during the Discovery Age, The New World sends the viewer back in time for a retelling of the story of Native American princess, Pocahontas, and gives a detailed perspective on life for the English Settlers of Jamestown and the Native Americans that encounter them. Colin Farrell, Christian bale, and new-to-the-screen actress Q'Orianka Kilcher lead an outstanding cast as John Smith (Farrell) John Rowlfe (Bale) and Pocahontas (Kilcher). The films cinematography is outstanding, having a subtle, artsy style that truly captures the essence of the story and time period. The costumes are extremely well done and fit the period. Unlike past Pocahontas tales such as Disney's version, Pocahontas, the story is historically accurate and the Native Americans don't speak English, and certainly not through magic as in Disney's story.

420,wheat108,So many people miss the point of this movie,10,21 January 2006,"I have finally seen the movie my soul has hungered for all my life. A film that is at once beautiful and resonant, with a spiritual depth, conveying the essence of our connection with God, the interaction between the Divine and Man. The film that is wholly satisfying on every level, with no mis-steps. I can now say ""The New World"" is the best movie I've ever seen. Exceeding Tarkovsky, Kurosawa….better than any one of them. This is not a ""Love Story"". Not in the traditional sense. It is about the Love of God as it flows through us. It is a film about Innocence. The power of innocence, the necessity of it as the thread that binds you to the experience of God. I mean the Innocence that is wisdom, without guile, full of compassion, imbued with joy that is in the moment, neither in the past or future. What the film shows so well is that this eternal resonance within us all is not bound to another person, not bound to a place, a time, or the transient things that you see around you. The journey conveyed in the film is the cutting of our artificial ties, breaking the conditionings that say I am defined by this person, by this place, by these times; by my reaction to the external. What is so exquisitely communicated in this film is the growth of this realization within Pochahontas. Joy is eternal, our connection with God is always there, it never goes away. It is our innermost choice is whether to let the external play affect our direct connection with God, which manifests as the bliss of Joy, utter peace, compassion, dignity, and the magnetism of a beautiful soul.Pochahontas had this connection; she was loved and respected by all. As the film progresses she begins to falter, letting her innermost essence be clouded by ""events"", by the things that happen on the outside. By the end she has regained what once she expressed so effortlessly, growing deeper, being in Joy and connected. She made that choice, the choice we all must make, the choice we make each moment. Smith has farther to go in this movie. But in the end he realizes the Truth that he had glimpsed, knew that was the direction he was headed, knew that he always had more to let go of, more of the Past clinging to him bringing him out of the present moment, away from the Love of God. ""The New World"" is primarily about these eternal spiritual truths. All of the themes in the movie revolve and spiral around them. There are so many wonderful layers to sink into when watching it, it really cheapens them to get into details. It is really too bad that so many people miss the depth of this film, looking so closely at the details (love story, plot, historical accuracy, etc.), especially as this movie is so clearly about things below the surface. (This point is so beautifully communicated in about 5 seconds towards the beginning, as we ""look up"" from the depths of the water at these ""naturals"".) I would recommend this to anyone who longs to see what film can aspire to as an art form. Go into the film with those expectations and you'll be wholly satisfied.",The New World

Yet this picture portrayed Native peoples with all of stereotypes of early relations, without a clear picture of the complexity of their society and their own motivations for dealing with the colonists. Instead we generally see them acting enamored of the colonist's technologies and making some kind of war whoops like this was an old cowboy movie.The only good thing about this movie: its lead actor. The strength of the actor playing Pocahontas could have driven this movie, yet for some reason, she isn't given enough material to work with except for dancing in the grass with Colin Farrell. Her coming of age and Anglicization could have been very moving, yet this does not come until the end of the film and by then, I just wanted to return the movie.While some may appreciate the way this film is shot, I found it extremely distracting, with random shots of the forest and water to be jarring and annoying. Had the director cut out such pretentious artwork, and focused on the relationships between the people in the movie (as well as given some like Christopher Plumer more opportunity to act) this piece might have been saved.",The New World
425,KNIGHTLY27,Historical revisionism and Indian paganism = A New World Flop,1,10 May 2006,"This movie was a field of [...]! What do I mean? ....It is a mixture of historical revisionism, New Age Indian paganism, Jungian psycho-analysis, and the Hollywood idol of naturalistic romanticism woven together into a twisted attempt to portray the life of Pocahantas. This was definitely not The New World and the founding of Jamestown! This was a New Age pagan view of the life of Pocahantas. The script was completely ludicrous and unhistorical, almost a dream world of stupid and silly comments about a supposed love relationship between John Smith and the Indian Princess Pocahantas. I think only illiterate queebs and brainless crack heads could have been at all pleased by the lack of serious conversation, dialogue and character development in this movie. Anyway, this twisted and romanticized version of John Smith and Pocahantas has now become a common lie and fabrication repeated by the historical idiots and ignoramuses in Hollywood. It is actually turning into some kind of Hollywood cult folklore! I suppose the Disney version was probably more entertaining, even though it was just as stupid and perverse! There is not a single factually true or even historically plausible conversation throughout this entire movie, or the Disney version for that matter. Why don't these Hollywood directors and producers ever read history??? I suppose it is their hostile New Age paganism and hatred of real American history. The movie moreover portrays the English settlers as being a bunch of dirty, filthy, confused, and violent hooligans who come to invade the Paradise of the innocent Indians. What a load of [...]! The movie therefore tries to gloss over the barbaric and savage perversities of the Indians and even tries to make them seem virtuous and innocent. More Hollywood paganism! Even the music though was ridiculously out of place. A slow movement from a well known Mozart piano concerto written in the 1780's and a piece from the German Romantic Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold written in the 1860's was a stupid and brainless idea. What was James Horner thinking here? Mozart, 19th century German Romanticism, oh yes, then glazed over with a touch of 20th century American minimalism all scored to supposedly portray the New World Discovery and the founding of Jamestowne???? I have no idea what makes these Hollywood producers such brainless [...]! In the early 17th century, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, and John Dowland were the famous English composers!!! Don't they know that??? It would have been much better and honorable and historically accurate if Horner had included such music into the score. And what about the cinematography? So what? I can watch the travel channel! All in all, this movie is a terrible flop, a cinematic load of [...] - very similar to the pile of [...] that John Rolfe and Pocahantas are portrayed (late in the movie) as having to trudge through on their way back to the house. This is exactly what I was feeling as I was watching this movie, that I was trudging through a field of [...]! Now I have to go and clean off my shoes.",The New World

However, an extreme use of voice overs, the endless use of beauty shots of Smith and Pocahantus walking and caressing in the forest, in the fields, by the river make this film about 45 min. too long. If you're a history buff, its a great view into what life must have been like at this particular time and place...no Hollywood glamor or stylized sets. It's gritty, dirty and raw. But in the end, it seemed like a very expensive documentary. With a degree in history and a love for Native American culture, I had really looked forward to the release.

I am a longtime Christian Bale fan, ever since Empire of the Sun. Also outstanding here was the simple presence of Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas; simply an actor you don't want to take your eyes off of. For me, she was as mesmerizing here as a young, new Juliette Binoche when she first was filmed. Just a non-existent script. On the flip side, I can never forgive Colin Farrell for Alexander.What irritated my about this film, and this might be slightly off topic, is that the 'settlers' were portrayed as so weak in character, with elements of narcissism, general neurosis, sadism, and self-pity that makes you want to slap most of them. The key phrase mentioned before, 'self-indulgent', is a kind way to put it. I was hoping Malick would be kind enough to wipe them all out with dysentery by the end...Its pretty to watch, though the disjointed cinematography nullified that for me. Colin Farrell did not spend nearly enough time in the cage.I thought that this film might have the promise of something like Three Colors: Blue, or even the more modest The Quiet Earth, but it tragically missed for me.",The New World
431,RACVMI,"Once again, Hollywood messes up a great story.",2,10 January 2006,"This could have been a great film, that is, if the fascinating true story were used instead of this boring deception. There was, in fact, no romance between Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Sorry! Smith was 27 in 1607 and Pocahontas was 10 or 11.I agree with a friend of mine who said that Smith comes across as a ""love sick puppy."" That was not the Smith of the historical record, not at all! Smith was a braggart and boastful, yet he was also a perceptive leader. Saving the failing colony was the great concern occupying Smith's thoughts, not a romantic fixation on a little Indian girl.Smith was only in Virginia from the spring of 1607 until the fall of 1609...two and a half years. There was a real (and unexpected and wonderful) romance in Pocahontas' life, but years later in 1613 and 1614 with John Rolfe...when she was an adult, at an age when Powhatan girls (and English girls) typically married. Smith was out of the picture and long back in England when Pocahontas had her real adult romance resulting in a marriage to John Rolfe and a son Thomas.This film was overly long, got the facts all mixed up, overlooked the most important elements of a fascinating story, had a poor soundtrack, and...well...it had some nice photography. (That's why I didn't rate it a 1.) If you have an interest, read the amazing true story from the historical record written by Smith, Rolfe, Hamor, Strachey, Percy, Archer, Dale and others. It's all there. This is just another example of where ""the book"" is far more interesting than the movie. And, heck, much of the book was written by Smith and Rolfe themselves! Too bad the creative types in Hollywood have to create fluff like this simply to showcase their high-priced celebrities.

The story is told through a series of mental reflections that are really just annoying. The film moves so slow that one feels like it is happening in real time, and it fails at engaging the audience to the point the we are really not disturbed by any of the bad things that happen to any of the characters.The worst part about this movie, however, is it portrayal of American Indians as ape-like hooting creatures who run around in loin cloths.

Well, even thought it has different topics, the main one its love, its a historical love story that never dies. Everyone interprets this movie in different ways, the way I perceived it was that pocahontas had two man in her life, the one she loved and the one she appreciated. The one who awaken her innocence with passion and the one who made her a submissive common woman(wife,mother). Both men loved her and somehow she loved them too, but in different ways. Pocahontas never let go of her first love which it was captain smith, she may have gone insane for losing her true love at some point in time, but she faced reality by facing john smith at the end of the movie, she knew things weren't going to work out but she kept loving him until the end, the beautiful thing is that she was honest of how she felt about love with her husband john rolfe and he understood, because he loved her.

The story is very limited. From the first minute, you know what will happen. Thats the same problem, on my opinion, that King Kong had. Great film-making, but a boring, all known story. Nevertheless the director brings the plot very sensitive in little steps to the audience and the characters are developed in details. There Tallick uses an explaining voice in the background, which tells us what the main-characters think and how they feel. Especially in that point - and in many more ways - the ""New World"" reminds me so much to ""The thin red line"", which is also so beautifully shot, but the better movie because of its content.After all, I would say, you cant say that Tallick did something wrong.

I did just that with 'The Thin Red Line' and was curious to see if I would with 'New World'. I guess I did in a different way, although maybe after more viewings(DVD), I may be able to break it down better.Quite honestly movie studios just don't make movies like this anymore, and if they do it's not with the budget that Malick had. His primary use of letting the images speak for themselves sans dialog is huge here. And with that, his musical scores, this one by James Horner(Braveheart/Titantic), play a integral part with the lack of dialog.No special effects, no artificial lighting, and I believe shot 80% with a 'steadycam' for full 360's(no track) gives you breathtaking scenery in the most natural sense. A hard edge, realism. I thought the acting was first rate, again since most was non-speaking. The ability to convey emotion without speaking has got to be the epitome of real 'acting'. Farrell, Kilcher, and Bale played the parts respectively.I'm not sure what creative license was taken in terms of the story. My wife is a teacher and recognized many things that she believed to be true, but I'm sure certain events were altered. All in all it's a powerful film.

After watching it three times, the ending of the movie still seems too ambiguous, but this is a tiny negative. And after almost all of the movie demonstrated its director's artistic rendering of British feeling for the new world IN the new world, the last scenes in England demonstrated an equally artistic rendering of British feeling for the new world in London. Pocohantas in the Court of James among the exotic animals and birds brought back from her America was absolutely perfect.

441,herbertificus,Some of the worst story-telling in history.,1,24 March 2014,"Movies like this are one reason why I object to one man both writing AND directing a movie. There's insufficient cross-checking of ideas and story-telling clarity and what you wind up with is often the product of one man's idiosyncrasies and shortcomings.Such is the case with Terrence Malick's ""The New World."" There are so many holes in this screenplay and it's such lousy story-telling that I quit watching halfway through even though I was extremely interested in the history. I'm not sure whether I was more infuriated at the poor story-telling wasting my time or I was put off by the cinematic technique of divorcing audio from video, which is nothing more than Malick's cinematic attempt at waxing poetic, or I was more irked by having my intelligence insulted by the whole thing.There are so many holes in the screenplay I don't know where to begin. The viewer is constantly saying, ""What happened to this character or that character; what season is it, what's happening with this or that subplot,"" and on and on and on. There are jumps in time, there are missing establishing shots, etc. There are totally unrelated shots interspersed in the flow of semi-related scenes that make me wonder whether Malick and the editors are schizophrenic.And I'll tell you this . . . if I were hired to edit this movie, I would have walked out after seeing what footage I had available for use. I would not want my name associated with this movie in any way, shape or form. The editors should hang their heads in shame.And can we talk about the dialog????? It was so grossly insufficient for plot flow it was ridiculous. During fully 50% of the scenes I was thinking, ""SAY something. SAY what you're thinking. ADVANCE the plot you mute moron!"" There's so much plot left on the table from the lack of meaningful dialog that it's just criminal. Malick should prohibited BY LAW from ever writing or publishing another screenplay -- it's that bad.I'm not even a film school grad and I know that cinematic techniques should never draw attention to themselves. The viewer should never be so conspicuously aware of any cinematic techniques that he feels manipulated by the director. Well, that's all one feels when watching this endless parade of disjointed scenes and manipulative schemes. One gets the feeling that director Malick is sitting next to you and staring at you saying, ""Watch what happens next. See this cinematic trick? See that stunt? What do you think of THIS? And TAKE THAT! Now here's more of THIS!"" (I got a similar feeling (but not as bad) during ""Armageddon"" because of the excessive and tiring slow-mo that the director over-used.) What people have been saying about special effects for 30 years is also true of artsy techniques: they can be nice, but they are NEVER a substitute for plot, dialogue and coherent, compelling story-telling.This movie was absolutely insulting to watch. To TRY to watch. I'd like to sit down and watch this movie with Malick so that I could stop it whenever I wanted and explain to him exactly what doesn't work and why. The only problem with that is I'd have to endure watching the rest of it.Malick's sentence for inflicting this abusive disaster on the public should be one year of incarceration with nothing to eat but bread and water and nothing to do but watch great (and coherent) movies, like ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Verdict"" and ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""One Hour Photo"" everyday, all day.The actors and crew and music man James Horner are hereby exonerated and found blameless.

This is the closest I've ever felt to *watching* fine literature or poetry on film. If you have an open, patient mind, you will be richly rewarded.Others have commented on the sluggishness of the film, or on Malick's over-reliance on natural footage to fill in for storytelling and characterization.

It goes against the grain of Hollywood films where every little twist of the plot gets smacked against your head. So, freed from the ""constraints"" of a narrative (and, in this case, excessive dialog) the film's strength is a visceral, emotional impact; pure visual wonder, fantastic scenes of things that have never before happened. Has any filmmaker better captured the fear, confusion, apprehension & excitement of the clash of civilizations? It felt unscripted, like anything could happen with the slightest misconstrued gesture or expression. The indians not only looked right, but we get inside of their culture in a way that's more immediate than has been previously depicted. (one part Coppola/Apocalypse + one part Herzog/Aguire + one part National Geographic) Theirs was indeed a paradise ... soon to be lost.

But this Hollywood fetish of saying ""Based on a true story,"" should stop. The New World film has too many distortions of history. John Smith met Pocahontos when she was only 11 years old. Though John Smith was a soldier of fortune, I do not believe he would rob the cradle. Also, it is to his credit, in actual history, that he tried to keep the Jamestown colony going before his unfortunate accident (gunpowder burns). To his discredit, he embellished a lot of his writing with wild claims of doing this or that. Pocahontos married an Indian warrior named Kokoom who disappeared after about two years of matrimony. And even though Pocahontos was converted to Christianity, John Rolfe. her second husband, was still concerned about marrying a ""heathen."" Nevertheless, this marriage brought time for the Jamestown colony; that is, the Indians didn't attack until it was too late to do anything about getting rid of the English colonists. When history is so distorted, the film should say ""This motion picture is a fictionalized account on what happened at Jamestown in 1607."" The pace of the film borders on being tedious. It is tedious! And Thomas Rolfe, the son, is born in 1615. Pocahontos dies in 1617. Therefore, the son is only two years old when his mother dies. The motion picture son is a lot older. The sets made for this motion picture are outstanding. No doubt, a lot of hard work went into making them. For that matter, the cast, the director, the composer, et cetera put their all into making this bit of cinema, but the final product left much to be desired.",The New World
448,yulinng,The New World setting New Bars for Movie Making,10,28 August 2012,"The New World is an epic, historical and biographical drama of Pocahontas' (Q'Orianka Kilcher) life, her two worlds, and the people in it. The film is set in 17th Century Virginia, spanning the first meeting between the Algonquin people and the English settlers, till the end of Pocahontas' life. In Terence Malick (The Thin Red Line) style, the film doesn't conform to the pace of conventional Hollywood plots. So if you can't handle deviation from Hollywood, you might want to avoid this film.However, those who persist will be rewarded. Gliding slowly across the surface of the river, Malick takes his time to draw you into his world of wild, natural and palpable beauty, with his visually meditative style, as you slowly lose your sense of being in a cinema. The authenticity of sight and sound (the set built only a distance from the actual site, the minute details of nature's sounds in the background, and the use of natural lighting only) gives a sense of reality unlike any other film I have seen.We experience the genuine connection and heartache of Pocahontas and John Smith's forbidden relationship, the loss of a kindred way of life, the displacement of her people, and her uneasy assimilation into, a less carefree, Western society. Here, she adopts a Christian name, learns to see the world through different eyes, and understands a different kind of love, with the stable and abiding John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Through all, she never forgets her roots, and displays the resilience of the character we have all come to know as Pocahontas.The casting of 14-year-old Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas was particularly refreshing. The combination of her unconventional beauty, childlike sincerity, and ""old-soul"" maturity is most unique, and apt to embody the emotional journeys of the young heroine. Colin Farrell, in my opinion, lacked a degree of sincerity in his acting and delivered a passable performance. Christian Bale, in his relatively smaller role as John Rolfe, gives a convincing performance that was understated and natural.As the character, John Rolfe, describes Pocahontas, ""she weaves all things together"", so this film weaves the themes of harmony with nature, displacement, commitment, love, loss, hope and life. It leaves audiences feeling expanded with the vastness of all the feelings we are capable of feeling as human beings. I highly recommend it.",The New World

Great costumes, but at least 20 minutes too long.One thing I did like was the educational resources on the website. They are nice for homeschoolers.It seemed like kinda a chick flick - but as a chick flick could have stood a few more cute little native baby shots.

The film hardly has any talking, it is mostly packed with slow-instrumental music which makes you wanna scream in the cinema. please don't pay any money to see this film, i wouldn't watch this film again if you gave me £1 million pounds. The sad thing is that it looks good from the trailers but i am being honest it is far from it. This film has to be the worst film i have ever seen. the cast was horrific and dreadful, Colin Ferrel was really horrible and cheesy and thats the only famous person i know who is in this film the rest of the cast i have never even seen or heard of.",The New World
452,sophiend,"A rewarding and humbling experience that the audience has to work for, rather than just sit back and watch.",9,6 May 2006,"If you are going to see The New World, be prepared to have to pay close attention and keep an open mind. For the fist half an hour I was immensely frustrated, both with the rambling editing and seemingly out-of-place music, but once I realised that what I was seeing was not a standard dialogue and scene-driven drama, but an exploration of love, colonisation and nature at its best. Once you surrender yourself to the jagged style and that every second of a scene might be the last and that many of them don't last more than two shots, you appreciate every little detail and cherish every word. This is not a film, this is a private video of a part of history, and you are invited to follow these characters around, privy to their most intimate moments. Seeing such touchingly realistic acting, I was amazed at how staged and stylised scripts have become, and how this director seemed to say so much with so little words. I was so refreshed after seeing this movie that I felt like running off into the wilderness and escaping the constraints of society forever. So much is crammed in to every minute that it seemed a bit hap-hazard; sort of a two and a half hour long trailer. It is not so much a slow pace that bores many viewers (the man in front of me left halfway through) but the need for them to expect nothing more than what they are shown. In other words, do not expect to be handed character motives and themes on a plate. My only grievance is that on its second night in West Australian cinemas, it was only given three sessions a day, as opposed to Mission Impossible 3's twelve. A great film for devoted and hardworking audiences, but not for the faint-hearted.",The New World
453,O-tank,A Glimpse of Hell,2,25 January 2006,"I have looked into the face of hell, and yawned. Hell is being locked into a theater and forced to watch Terrence Malick's ponderous 'The New World' for all of eternity. No thank you. I would rather find a rusty, sharpened piece of metal and gouge my eyes out.'The New World' is basically an exercise in patience. If you can watch a David Lynch film without falling asleep, than this might be the movie for you. It's visually stunning with the constant rippling of water and trees waving seductively in the wind, but a movie is more than its visuals. There are certain fundamental aspects that a movie cannot survive without. A coherent plot (are you reading this Lynch), intriguing dialog, and of course, convincing acting.There is no real plot to speak of. I can summarize it in short abrupt sentences that a caveman might use. Man loves girl. Man leaves. New man loves girl. Fin. There is no real dialog to speak of. The movie is mainly composed of whispered voice over that are as forgettable as the characters who say them. The characters are mainly forgettable due to the actors playing them, which is surprising, considering the obvious talent that Christian Bale and Colin Farrell (not including Alexander) have shown in previous films. Bale and Farrell maintain the same expression throughout the movie. Calling them wooden would be a disservice to ventriloquist dummies.Congratulations Malick, you are on my list, right between Uwe Boll and David Lynch. You are the Dr. Frankenstein of the 21st century. In your quest to create life, an abomination has been created. Who gave you the right to play god! My advice to the rest of humanity; do not spend one penny to see this abomination. Rather, wait for it to enter the $2 bin at Wal-Mart, shop-lift it, and burn it so that no trace remains.",The New World
454,wlwinner,Terrible movie,1,23 January 2006,"This may have been one of Malick's best films, but the movie itself was one of the slowest movies I've watched in a long time. Reminded me of trying to get through 2001: A Space Odyssey. While the cinematography was beautiful, the script must have only been 30 pages long. Also curious was the fact that Pocahontas' name was never uttered, nor was her husband's name. There were a few action scenes with some fairly interesting fighting, but the scenes themselves had slow classical music set to them as if to say...these were beautiful fights full of harmony and balance. There was too much focus on cinematography. As the movie was drawing to an end...I kept thinking...""just end it!"" And they did just end it, abruptly by, not rolling the credits, but just throwing up the first set of names filling the screen with no real music. It just died...as it should have.",The New World
455,the-couga,Film as Art,10,23 January 2021,"Although this film is a masterpiece, I can at least understand why some do not like it. If you're conditioned for a short attention span, and constantly need explosions and dialogue to keep you interested, you probably will not like this movie.Most of Malick's movies are an acquired taste, and this one is no different. He just goes about film-making in a very unique and different way from what today's movie-watchers are used to. He tells a story through pictures, not words. His inspirations come from old, silent films as much as they do from more modern artistic masterpieces, like Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. In fact, Barry Lyndon is a very, very good comparable to this movie, and this movie's final scenes in London, in my opinion, are a not so subtle homage to it. Both Barry Lyndon and The New World have simple, classical plots (Lyndon being the classic tragedy, and TNW being the a classic romantic drama), and there are few if any unexpected plot twists or surprises. Christopher Nolan films these are not. Both films, however, make their mark by telling their stories perfectly--impeccable cinematography, art design, and costume design, a meticulously-crafted score, and perfect acting. In order to put yourself in the proper mindset to view a Malick movie, you need to sit down with the expectation that you are reading a picturebook, not a novel. To Malick, the entire point of cinema is to tell you a story visually. Instead of looking for dialogue, let yourself get immersed in the imagery and let your own imagination fill in the gaps.With that said, this is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. Malick's films have always been visual masterpieces, but this is his first pairing with Emmanuel Lubezki--who I think is the greatest cinematographer in the history of film. The way he captures the beauty of nature, and the way he makes the actors' souls come alive with his camerawork is unparalleled. The classical music score fits perfectly with the production. While some people may think the plot is slow due to minimal dialogue, the narrative arc of the story is driven by eliciting viewer's reactions to its philosophical undertones. What is love? Is it romantic excitement, or is it dependability? What is the destiny of these two cultures coming together for the first time? Will the guilt that John Smith feels as he contemplates that destiny become a wedge between him and Pocahontas? Will this make him feel not good enough for her? Is he being selfish or selfless in leaving to go back to England? Brave or a coward? Is there any salvation in a world such as this? Any power organizing this level of beauty? Anything certain or meaningful to latch on to?During the slower parts of the film, these are some of the questions that are meant to occupy a viewer's mind, while being lulled into a trance by the film's elemental beauty. The plot, in this sense, is the most emotionally authentic one I can recall seeing since maybe Field of Dreams, as Malick guides the viewer to thoughtful answers to each of the above. When you couple this philosophical plot perfection with the film's visuals, you get that ""I have to cry it's so beautiful"" feeling at at least three or four different points along the way. (I also have to add here that I'm a guy that likes his share of Schwarzenegger explosion/shoot 'em up/action films as well).Malick's films require a bit of effort by the viewer, and require a bit of a trained eye and mind to be accessible, much like appreciation for classical music, jazz, or progressive rock can require a trained ear. I believe that is why the beauty of this film goes over the head of a non-negligible number of viewers. If some folks wish to characterize that as high-minded and/or self-indulgent, they can, but if you can overcome that cynicism, you will be handsomely rewarded by a majestic work of art with unparalleled beauty.",The New World
456,jayt5,The worst movie that I actually sat all the way through,1,21 January 2006,"I think maybe Bob Longino of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution sums it up best: ""...more an ethereal cinematic tone poem than plot-driven story."" This could be why I stayed the hell away from English as much as possible in college. And decided to become a biologist. Damn close to three hours of little dialogue, little action, but a lot of highlights. And by highlights, I mean Colin Farrell's hair. It kept getting lighter and lighter streaks. About an hour and a half in, when I realized that nothing was going to happen any time soon, I started to get very bored. By the time Pocahontas died at the end, I was practically cheering for Death. It didn't matter whose--Pocahontas', the writer/director's, mine...They went on into this collage of the sky and junk like that, while we were just hoping for the damn movie to be over. I glanced over at the two friends, who were trying not to laugh. Which of course, made me crack up. But no one else seemed to be, so I had to try to keep myself from filling the theater with it. Didn't really work. But I believe I set off some other UCLA students.It may not be the worst movie I've ever seen (I believe that dubious honor goes to ""Freddie Got Fingered""), but I would definitely go so far as to say it was the worst movie that I actually sat all the way through.",The New World

458,kathleen-59,A Perfect Betrayal,10,24 January 2006,"I am sure others have explained why this film is great. Terrence Malick has a definite style and it is one that I find brilliant. The mood he creates is absolutely mesmerizing. He explores issues of subjectivity in a very interesting way and of course this film is incredibly beautiful. Do not expect an action or war movie. Most of the film is silent, lyrical, complex, and often heartbreaking. I could watch it 100 more times and probably will. The entire film is like a whisper. This movie is very much like The Thin Red Line but he reduces the number of story-lines to three. I thought the multiple and choppy story lines, often difficult to follow, in the thin red line was actually quite appropriate to embodying the nature of the Vietnam War. I think in the New World the focus on three stories and really ultimately one (that of Pocahantas) is very effective. It also gives a real 360 degree meaning to the title of the film. I think Malick is a master at synthesizing the medium of film and the narrative/subject. I can also see that this film would not satisfy the majority of audiences who are looking for something that is really the opposite of what The New World actually delivers.(A saw a few people walk out of the theater) However, this ""betrayal"" only makes the meaning of the film all the more powerful.",The New World

This film, no different, is vast and incredible, riveting despite an appearance of slowness. Subtle storytelling that furthers innocence and sweetness. Honest as to the ways in which people get involved with one another and begin acting on each others' behalves. Heart breaking, familiar, important. Perfectly cast. Colin Farrell's puckish public persona adds a layer of perceived (or real?) emotional immaturity to John Smith's character that explains, utterly, his priorities.

The pacing of the movie was horribly off. At one minute it was fast paced with good speed, the next it was agonizingly slow. The romance scenes were almost deliberately boring and repetitive. I must have seen the actress' back like 50 times. The script was almost non-existent and sparse at best. Accents changed or were different from actor to actor, one type being English and the other being a mix of English and American.I will say that the sets, wardrobe, and props were all high caliber, albeit slightly off in the year.

The story bounced from here to there then everywhere else and I had to keep rewinding it to catch the actual story. What was the editor thinking??? Was the editor rushed or just didn't care? Were they told to cut the time down at the detriment of the movie? If the editing were as good as the visuals, this movie would be a certain 10.

462,kangarookuei,"a very quaint and whimsical film, read me if you've already seen it! and lets reflect!",10,30 January 2006,"I watched 'New World' the other night with my parting brother for old times sake, and though he usually is easily satisfied, and I am very easily disappointed, in the end we both found this movie quite pleasing. We did not argue or bicker over it as we normally would; instead, after we left, we noted a few things still on our mind such as historical accuracy, which was a minor relevance, since the movie managed to enrapture our attention so well during it. We kept quiet for the most part. I went into this movie expecting several things I read from other reviews--that it would be 'long' and 'slow,' that I would either 'hate it, or love.' Aside from the things I noted, I'm glad I stayed and watched the movie in it's entirety--and it should be noted that New World is actually worthy of the big screen.There were certain quaint things about this film that made it charming; the way the director (this is the first film of his I have watched) filmed from bottom up; often you were given body parts and appendages that usually don't receive so much attention--such as the neck, a stomach, a chest, or a shoulder. All in all, it made for a much more intimate feel. There were many shots of scenic things, and though they were well done, I thought they were hardly close to the merit they received from others. It was beautiful, yes (and there is a reoccurring theme in the manner they keep showing it), but it was not the beauty of nature the film captured itself that made me want to keep watching. The actor for Pocahontas, and I do not know her name, was bewitching and lovely. It was her whimsical ability in conjunction with the director's mind, that made it so enthralling. Watching her frolic through fields of grasses, and her peculiar behavior to strangers was quite enough--but it was also her image. Throughout the movie, she seemed so innocent, and infallible to say the least. I am almost tempted even, to say she did not know what she wanted at some points because of the abrupt changes that were brought by the English. There were also different aspects that brought a primal warmth within me. The rapport between Smith and her: two strangers in paradise. Two things came to my mind as Smith kept asking himself if he was living a dream: What is love, and can it last? It's a nifty idea to play with--and even later, Smith tells her that he is 'not who you think,' he is. One of the things my brother and I noted was the significant of holding hands. In New World, holding hands meant so much more--touch, meant so much more. It was not a trite, often meaningless thing we do nowadays.It meant something as if trust,reflecting on what Pocahontas said before she held Wolfe's hand: ""Are you kind?"" Turning something we take for granted and transforming it into something so meaningful is not easy, particularly in film, on screen--and that should be applauded. There was also Wolfe's introduction into the film. We all know from historical texts that he marries Pocahontas, and during the film, I was pretty disinclined toward Wolfe, seeing as how he was the second to appear, and Smith was the first. But later, he emerges as a very, respectable man, and when he first set his sight on Pocahontas, it brought about a very reminiscent feel in me, the way he watched her go about in social solitary, his mind rolling thoughts about her,""What do you dream about?"" In honesty, it reminded me of Jr. high, when girls suddenly no longer had koodies, and we wished we knew all we could about them in intangible romances. On a side note, the scene where Pocahontas mourned Smith's belied death was very touching, and not to say, the least corny. Minimal dialogue and voice-overs are a touch that I have never witnessed before, and am quite surprised that it didn't make the film difficult to grasp or interfere with it's flow. The voice-overs in fact, helped personify what the characters were thinking, and made it more personal with the audience, while the dialogue pushed the plot and action on through. It was very much a character-driven film. The music was complimentary, and though you realize the same song or cadence is playing over and over, it's not repetitive. The score for the final closing of the movie was quite, powerful and not overly long either. It ended almost like an ode to Pocahontas, as it very much was her story. All in all, it gave good closure--that or you just get better closure from long movies.This was a thinking cap movie. I thought a lot about it afterward. In reflection it's still pretty amazing, the myth about Pocahontas. Historical accuracy doesn't really matter now that I think about it, and it wasn't a big determinant in the first place. It's just a myth, about people or a person, whose story was significant enough, or managed to stay alive long enough, and it was inspiring enough that people draw up their own versions of it.",The New World

It is measured, does not hurry anywhere, but there is no feeling of tightness. Music helps to immerse yourself in this slow narrative, a kind of evolution of characters, to see the culture of an ancient civilization.The main characters are ambiguous, they are not sure that they are acting correctly, because the world has not known such unions and acquaintances before, and, therefore, no one understands what will be better.The experiences of Pocahontas are perfectly shown.

The characters are all intensely, unconventionally, introverted, and the actors resist any temptation to exaggerate what is a sad but unsentimental story. And, while it's been said countless times, the landscapes of Virginia which are captured in this film are absolutely gorgeous. While I sometimes wished that the cinematographer had dispensed with the slow motion and disorienting cuts and opted for a more of a documentary-style, they did add a dreamlike quality to the film which seemed to parallel Pocahontas's and John Smith's mindsets.The film's greatness weakness, ultimately, is it's running time. The first 75 minutes focuses on John Smith and Pocahontas's romance, only introducing John Rolfe in the last hour. Rolfe simply isn't given enough time to develop as a character, and the audience isn't given enough time to understand the life Pocahontas has with him. If a good fifteen or twenty minutes had been added to that part of the story, her final decision to stay with Rolfe and her son would have had a greater emotional impact. Nevertheless, the ending was effective in cementing Pocahontas's change from a young lovestruck girl to a mature wife and mother, and was therefore a fulfilling conclusion to the film.",The New World

467,swborderer,As Good As Film-making Gets,10,25 February 2006,"Under the current regime of Hollywood film-making, where extreme closeups, staccato editing and short attention spans represent the norm, director Terrence Malick is a throwback to a more sublime era.With ""The New World"" - just his fourth feature release in a career spanning more than 40 years - Malick puts his finely-honed craft on full display, offering a deliberate pacing not seen in many years. For those unaccustomed to such cinematic devices, the small investment of attention required here is richly rewarded.Although the film's time frame spans the historic first 10 years of England's first successful North American colony - the Jamestown settlement, located on what is today's Yorktown peninsula in Virginia - the film is more about the sudden clash of cultures and people thrown together by fate and ambition than it is a mere history lesson.This is not to say, however, that Malick plays fast-and-loose with the actual history of the subject, as is another common custom among epic historical filmmakers. In fact, much of what we know of the Jamestown story as it is recorded in surviving original documentation is represented here, with only a few minor details having been changed or compressed for the purpose of brevity, clarity or plot cohesiveness. Also, the period detail represented here is immaculate, including everything from a full-scale recreation of the original Jamestown fort (or as best it could be, given the limited documentation of the original settlement), to the authentically recreated 17th Century clothing and language.Another impressive feature of ""The New World"" is its depiction of the native Powhatan peoples whom the English first encounter. Great pains were obviously taken to bring this extinct culture back to vibrant life in its dwellings, dress - and language, with the native actors speaking only Algonquin, a form of which the original Powhatans would likely have spoken.And for those looking for the now familiar tale of Pocahontas and John Smith as it relates to Jamestown, this is probably the most accurate portrayal of that story ever depicted in a feature film - but the film as a whole offers so much more than just that well-worn storyline.Those familiar with Malick's earlier films such as ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" will instantly recognize his brilliant, visceral style in ""The New World,"" complete with flowing water, ripples of windswept natural grasses and the ambient sounds of nature included within.Both figuratively and literally, Malick takes the viewer back in time with ""The New World,"" offering an example of classic film-making in its most artistic form, as well as a visual postcard from a long-lost era.",The New World

474,ConlonsGirl,Beyond Words,9,8 February 2006,"Wow, i really can't find the words to describe this movie except that i loved it. I love the way it went beyond saying things or expressing feelings mostly through speech, and instead - showing you the way a single look can deliver a message or can show one...or several emotions that a million words could never amount to or do justice for. I like how they said a lot with their eyes. And i don't know, when she spoke, you know it was meant wholeheartedly and with the purest of intentions. I loved the point of view narratives, they were just so poetic and i loved the way she understood marriage as simply when your heart belongs to someone and that, ultimately, is what binds you to that person. I also like how it shows how although a certain love for someone may never cease, it can evolve, just as a choice concerning that love can also evolve when you begin to understand yourself, your situation, and life - and that you can find happiness again, even though it may be different from the happiness before. Q'Orianka Kilcher delivered an amazing performance. Love, sweeping and epic. It took my breath away.",The New World
475,wilkins37-1,Extraordinary picture!!,10,23 December 2005,"Quite possibly, the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Certainly, there's never been anything like it. I would suggest familiarizing oneself with the story of Jamestown, Capt. John Smith, and Pocahontas to appreciate the film all the more. Terrence Malick (Harvard Rhodes Scholar, Professor of Philosophy at MIT, etc.) naturally assumes the story is already well known. Anyone who might have missed that day in school will probably miss a lot in the movie and assume it's somehow incomplete in it's exposition. Assuming the audience already knows the true story allows the director to go in a different direction with the film. An incredible experience! I was moved beyond words and expect numerous Academy Award nominations for this one.",The New World
476,ktuls1,Apparently Terrence Malik is too good for acceptable performances or a script.,4,7 February 2006,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is better than four stars, in many respects. As art, it is a meticulously-crafted masterpiece in which writer-director Terrence Malick flexes his strongest American Film Institute-trained muscles. As entertainment, however, it is a disjointed story that cares little for plot or character development, and is likely to drive the casual movie watcher to leave halfway through the 150-minute opus under a cloud of boredom and frustration. ""The New World"" is clearly a product of amazing skill, but it is lacking in the core elements of greatness.The film documents the settlement of the first American colony of Jamestown in 1607 in grimy, muddy, bloody detail. Boldly taking on another ""historical figure"" role after the floppy ""Alexander"", Colin Farrell portrays Captain John Smith, the only professional soldier in the entire expedition. Sent out to create an alliance with the Native Americans in the newly-founded Virginia, he meets and falls in love with the youngest daughter of the chief, Pocahontas, played by Q'Orianka Kilcher. Somehow, a ""Romeo and Juliet"" style feud between the settlers and the natives sparks, and the lovers are forced to deal with rejection from both sides.Malick does capture the wonder with which the English settlers must have seen the new world, as well as the gritty truths inherent in the struggle to start a new community from scratch in the uncharted wilderness. Kilcher's simple, earthy beauty is perfectly accentuated, and her transition from savage to civilized amid the quiet brooding of Farrell makes her the most (if not only) dynamic character in the film.Malick's cinematography rightly does a lot of the talking, but there's only so much that you can say through meditative shots of wheat fields and rainy swamplands. The film rushes through the major plot points in hurried synopses between segments of artsy footage, usually in the form of contemplative narration by the characters or one-sided conversations between two extras. It's like reading the SparkNotes version of the real script  you know what's happening, but the soul of the action is gone. Smith and Pocahontas meet, and a few intimate, well-shot visuals of their relationship later, they're hopelessly in love and she knows conversational English. There is a battle scene, but you don't quite know why the natives attacked. Everyone but Pocahontas fades into the scenery, so the rest of the characters have the emotional drive of a History Channel documentary. Malick focused so much on the visual aspects of the film that you feel like you're merely watching and not experiencing  there is no immersion into anyone but the princess, and the surfaces of the rest of the characters are only skimmed.The plot becomes a little more comprehensible in the film's second act, with the departure of Smith for England and the entrance of Pocahontas' eventual husband John Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Here Malick departs from art for a little bit of storytelling as the princess struggles to fit into a strange world, her only link to which has moved across the sea and is presumably dead. Her transition into her new Anglo-life has the compelling conflict of values that the film has wanted the whole time, and as she explores the foggy streets of London itself you can feel her marvel at the impossibly high stone buildings and other wonders of the civilized world. The return to a more artistic form of expression at the end of the film finally carries some emotional weight, but it is too little, much too late.The buzz surrounding ""The New World"" is that it is a major cinematic triumph  maybe it's just the English major in me, but a film has to be more than just a clever string of interesting photography and a dramatic score to be great. There were moments in this film that seemed like a CK1 commercial  two intertwined figures rolling in the grass to whispered bits of introspective narration. Sometimes, such moments can be very powerful. It's just that nearly the entire story is told that way, and some of the best drama is lost. ""The New World"" has been justifiably nominated for a few minor awards for cinematography and original score, but I would expect the honors to stop there. It's worth a watch if you're willing to give your attention span a workout for the sake of the technical achievements, but it's up to you to decide if they can carry a plot. In my humble opinion, they can't.",The New World
477,appypollyloggies,One of the most hauntingly beautiful movies I've seen in years.,10,11 February 2006,"I just got back from the New World. It moved to a discount theater where I live and I didn't want to miss it. Even with the small the children running around and the old couple behind me who kept talking, I was completely sucked into the movie.The scene opens with ships arriving in Virginia, 1607. You see the sailors stare out at the wilderness, fascinated by its untamed beauty. You see ""The Naturals"" or Native Americans watch the ships with fear and curiosity. No words are spoken, but the pictures tell more that anyone could ever describe.The use of images and the cinematography are breathtaking. Mixed in with a haunting score by James Howard and you get one of the most beautiful, thought provoking films this year.People in the theater grew restless or left because some would find this movie slow. The problem is that people aren't used to just images and music in a movie. They want action thrown into their face throughout the whole film. If you come to ""The New World"" expecting constant action and dialogue, then you might as well not go at all.It's not a story of action and the violent clash between the English and the Native Americans. It's a story of exploration, love, and the birth of a new world.For being one of the most beautiful movies I've seen all year, I give ""The New World"" a 10 out of 10.",The New World
478,marcinwilk,Brilliant New Movie By Terrence Malick,10,31 May 2006,"After his fantastic war film ""The Thin Red Line"", I had serious doubts that his new movie would be nearly as good as it. How the heck can you top perfection ?Considering Mr. Malick picked Colin Farell, whom I had most utterly hated so far, as the leading role in his new movie, I only shook my head and was appalled by his bad taste and choice. After watching THE NEW WORLD for the first time last night, I was more than pleasantly surprised by Farell's acting. In fact, it was the best performance of his career and now I cannot imagine anybody BUT Farell to play the leading role. This proves Malick's genius who delivered a visually astonishing picture and chose the perfect cast. Of course, this new film bears many beautiful parallels to his other masterpiece THE THIN RED LINE. The concept of love and hate are highlighted in this movie and some of the phrases will strongly remind the attentive follower of the Thin Red Line. ""I belong to you"", this phrase uttered out of Pocahonta's mouth instantly reminded me of Private Bell's sweet and simple ""I belong to you"" addressed at his wife. Just like in The Thin Red Line, where we felt submerged into the natural surroundings of the Solomore Islands, we also get to hear and see New England's flora and fauna. Some of the sounds strongly reminded me of the birds' sounds on Guadalcanal. Some of the shots also brought me some of The Thin Red Line's pictures into my head. The shadow swallowed by the sun reaching its peak at noon before the battle's commencement can also be seen in The New World. Thank you, Mr. Malick, you are a true genius and unfortunately some people have not recognized this. But you will most certainly remembered of one of the greatest directors, or maybe THE greatest director, of the 20/21 st century in the distant future. No one will forget your beautiful poetic pictures.",The New World
479,davsalt,Biggest Disappointment of the Year,1,25 May 2006,"OK, after seeing endless previews on this movie I expected it to be the next great historical drama (i.e. Last of the Mohicans, Gladiator, whatever). I don't need a movie to be full of action and even normally enjoy movies with now action. However, a movie should not be hyped up to the extent of New World without backing it up even the least. This movie dragged, dragged, and dragged, holding the viewer to wait for the climax of the movie. Perhaps the only reason that I didn't walk out was to wait and hope that something in the movie would be different. However, after over two hours of watching two people walk through the forest, I was left extremely disappointed. I'm not saying that this was the worst movie I saw in the last year. It wasn't. However, New World did fail to meet its expectations unlike any movie I have seen in a very long time.",The New World
480,TeenChrist87,Terrible Movie,1,26 May 2006,"I was very anxious to see The New World since I am a fan of Disney's Pocahontas. I wanted to see if this was anything like it. In a few ways it was, but not too many. My rating on this movie doesn't have anything to do with Disney's Pocahontas. My rating is on this movie itself. It was a complete bore. After 1 hour and 15 minutes I just couldn't take it anymore. It really was THAT bad. I can't believe people actually like this movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to punish your teenagers. Just put this movie in and it could be worse than grounding them and taking away their allowance. It really is THIS bad.",The New World

It is an accurate depiction of that time period. The costumes were great, and the acting,when they talked, was great. But how much can you watch two people look at each other forever 2 hours. It is a good introductory movie for the girl and she played her character wonderfully, however it is upsetting she was not given more dialog. I was expecting more out of this movie. See it if you are really into history because it is accurately and informative about the Virginia settlers.

Mallick is a great cinamotographer but is mentally retarded when it comes to directing. this is something he should not be able to do to anyone ever again. if you read this and think I'm dumb and decide to see the movie anyway don't say i didn't warn you. this movie wasted two and a half hours of my life that i can never get back.

484,bcool6341,Booorrrrrriiiiinnnnngggggg!,2,27 May 2006,"This was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long, long time. The 2+ hrs. of running time felt more like 3+. The cinematography is beautiful but the repetitious musical score just grated on my nerves. There is hardly any dialogue and when there was, it was hard to really understand what they were saying. If I had to watch one more scene of Pocahontas frolicking through a field with John Smith, I thought I was going to scream. Didn't they ever have to work?? And she sure seamed to learn English awfully quickly, what little bit was said. I thought the movie was finally going to start getting interesting once she married and went to visit England, could have been so much more to show. They just sort of breezed and rambled through the whole thing, once again with that annoying soundtrack blaring in the background. I didn't believe the chemistry for one second between the two leads. There was some with Christian Bale. But it became a joke when she and Bale began to also frolic through the fields. I'm sure the real Pocahontas was so much more interesting than this movie made her out to be. It was hard to get to know any of the Indians or really understand what they were all about. Was it just me or did there seem to be next to no women and children in the Indian camp? I would NOT recommend this film.",The New World
485,teedboux,"poorly written, directed and edited",3,28 January 2006,"I found this film quite disappointing on many levels. The editing was choppy and amateurish, and they could have left about 15min. of footage out because it was just actors looking at each other without dialogue. It made the 2.5 hrs seem more like 3.5. Much of the remaining dialogue was mumbled and sometimes incomprehensible. I thought Colin Farrell's acting was unimpressive - his range of emotions was quite limited. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a superb actress and I hope to see her in future movies - it is unfortunate that Native American roles are so few and far between. The flow of the story was quite fragmented without proper transitioning and they kept alternating between peace and war with the natives, but there was no explanation. At some points a couple of natives have their hands tied as prisoners and the next minute they are helping paddle the canoe. I was surprised that James Horner did the musical score- it was just a very loud new age synthesizer that by the end of the movie was almost deafening. Is that what they listened to in the 1700's?",The New World
486,quirogal,It's about time someone got it right,10,21 January 2006,"This was an amazing movie. I'm so pleasantly surprised. I really had no expectation...or rather, very low expectations on account of Colin Farrell's ""Alexander"". I figured this would be just another historical drama that disappoints, or a wildly unrealistic romance. My main curiosity was to see how well they portrayed the Algonquin natives. They seemed very authentic in the previews. To my astonishment, this was the least of the breath-taking aspects of the movie. I agree with another reviewer that many people are not going to be able to appreciate this film. It's a shame. I'm sure many are flocking to see it with the same expectation of seeing the standard historical action/drama/romance and they'll miss the subtlety and poetic beauty of the narrative and photography. Malick used similar technique in ""Thin Red Line"" but it didn't seem to enhance that story. Perhaps because that was a ""war"" movie, I didn't think his style worked. In this case, the ethereal, otherworldliness, and metaphysical perspective fit in perfectly with the mutual discovery taking place. Despite my knowledge of this particular time in history, I felt I was given a fresh look at this event and the people who lived it. Definitely for a more mature audience, not action movie fans.",The New World

Well, it doesn't. The acting was awful, there was basically little to no dialog, and the directing was so heavy handed, it bordered on oppressive.

488,e.harkins,Loved this wondering lyrical film,10,5 October 2006,"It's a long time since I went to a mainstream commercial cinema and was so taken by a film. In the style that Malick is known for, he seems to keep the camera, and therefore the viewer, in a mode that you feel is moving in and around and through real events unfolding. Yet the events also seem to be like memories recalled or dreams remembered.And the music... awe, jist great.I suspected I was onto a winner when several members of the audience dribbled out dazed and disappointed as they realised they were not watching the usual good ol' pap-and-violent-slush that the USA film industry pushes out.",The New World
489,mohawkalooch,This is no Hollywood Blockbuster.....it's Art.,10,2 January 2006,"This film is a painting come to life. Malick is a really special film maker and this is a real jewel. His long shots give the actors time to actually convey emotion and there are some incredibly powerful moments in this film. Being of Native ancestry and a student of Native history the attention to detail as far as costuming and sets.......amazing. The actually story line? Somewhat skewed from the real story.....but the real story would take a 4 day film to truly convey and it's hard enough to keep people's attention for more than 90 minutes in a theater. The important points are all there. The standout here is Kilcher, a real stunning debut....so graceful and emotionally complex. Body language is abundant and rightly so, the meetings of the English and the ""Naturals"" was as odd as an alien invasion. Most communication is through the eyes......and is brilliantly displayed here. I must say that this a great cinematic experience. The only thing that bummed me out about the film, wasn't the film at all, it was a few in the audience that exclaimed at the closing credits....""thank god!! that was so long!!!""......""so boring!"" , which is typical of your average meat head, movie goer just looking for explosions and fart jokes. Which leads me to believe that's why in the film they keep Pocahontas(Kilcher) chest covered. In reality, during warmer months, Native men and women were almost completely naked and painted in some way or another. I'm sure Malick wanted to go for authenticity, but it's the repressed society that we live in would have had a field day with a 15 year old girl going topless AND running around with Colin Farrell. Running time is around 3 hours with not a frame wasted. Anyway, All the performances were outstanding, with special kudos going to Raoul Trujillo who plays Tomoco AND choreographed all the Native dancing as well as Christian Bale giving John Rolfe a face. Bravo. A must see in the theater.......and see it in a good theater with a good sound system. Well worth the price of admission.",The New World

492,hi-lovely,De Ja Vu,4,10 May 2006,"Terrance Malick does it again, literally!! Don't worry, there are no spoilers. Of all the comments people will read about this New World movie, there will only be one that deviates from praising his gimmicks. Don't get me wrong, as a viewer I am a backseat cinematographer at heart, and also strongly believe that films like the latest of Terrance Malick's are what vividly define the line between simple flick and sultry film. BUT!! and there is a but -you can believe it- New World simply ceases to satisfy, mainly because I have seen this before, somewhere, in THIN RED LINE!!!! Thats not even what tops the cake: There is one scene amongst his many other semi-montage-like scenes that are accompanied with semi-monologue narratives -this gimmick sounds complicated, but flows well on screen- in one specific scene, the Pocahontas character asks the forest, referring to it as the great father, who he is, and to show his face. Not surprisingly, in THIN RED LINE, so does Jim Caviezel. This reminds me of the good old days in high-school, where my specialty in passing classes was to recycle good lines and ideas into other papers in order to get the same academic result, a B+. Amateur stuff -although this may have been an intentional move on the director's part, for maybe eluding to his trademark themes of nature and religion within all of his latest two movies after Malick's return from filmmaker exile- I can understand the artistic attempt at cross-overs and such, but this is simply my point, the movie deserves the B+, mainly because it was already done, by the same person that did it before nonetheless. And in that sense C-. I am really disappointed in the collective and almost cohesively associated comments about this movie. Clearly, none of you knew who this guy was before watching the movie, while others who have more clearly see that line that separates the lovers of cinema -and believe me, I love a lot- from the average movie watcher.

The rest of the cast is acceptable. Christian Bale did a good job with his role, but he doesn't appear on screen until the last 3rd of the movie. The scenery is pleasant but not enough to make up for the horrid script.We fast forwarded through the last 20 minutes having already wasted 2 hrs on this awful film, hoping it would get better (afterall, it was rated a 7.0).

And finally; If they were going to use the music from Wagners opera Siegfried, they ought to have done it properly, not use a lame plagiarization. I sat there waiting for the music to reveal itself, but in stead it seemed like they'd just cut a short piece of music out of the opera and put it on repeat with ever increasing volume.

There is some beautiful cinematography, but again it does not make up for the ponderous movement of the scenes and interaction between characters. Although the story was obviously about Captain Smith and Pocahontas, their relationship would have meant more to the viewer if other characters were more strongly built around them. The viewer also loses sense of time, especially when Pocahontas is suddenly very fluent with English with only a hint of how that happened. Two of the four of us watching it just couldn't handle the snail's pace, and the remaining two said it should have ended at least 15 minutes before it did.

The use of the musical passages from Wagner and Mozart were inspired.One would never have guessed it was from the USA. I would love to see it again. The nearest I could compare it to was grand opera in terms of its impact. Surely the best thing Farrell has done. The use of freely mobile camera shots gave the impression of a documentary, as if you were with the first explorers of the continent.You had to use a lot of intuitive reasoning which got you deeply involved with the themes of the film. The blossoming of the love between Smith and his native ""Eve"" was handled with the most delicate of touches and the lack of overt ""nudity"" was a surprising and refreshing touch.",The New World
503,rcferguson,Please god make it stop!!,1,29 May 2006,"Now I know why Elvis shot out his TV. He wasn't drunk, He was watching this movie. I am a movie junkie. I was really excited about this one because I live several miles from where they shot this film. I was prepared for a big budget re-telling of the founding of Jamestown. Boy was I wrong. This over-bloated, self absorbed ART film is AWFUL. I wish I could blame a bad script but there's virtually no dialogue. The movie runs roughly 2h 12min and has maybe 5 pages of dialogue. The rest of the time is spent walking through tall grass, looking at sunsets or having John Smith and Pocahontas make googly eyes at each other. For the last hour of the film, substitute John Rolfe for John Smith and repeat previous line. I know that more happens than that, but by that time, I'd been so bored already that I fell into a slight coma and didn't really care anymore. Please, I you want to see a early American Indian/Colonial love story just watch Last of the Mohicans instead.",The New World
504,christopher-crosby,great factual and sensitive film,9,31 May 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film the attention to detail was superb apart from the few goofs, the most prominent being at the end when the ships are in the harbour in england (cornwall to be precise) as the camera pans up a modern sailing ship complete with white painted handrails and a navigation radar affixed to the mast can be clearly seen in the top right of the picture. How they missed that is beyond but the rest made up for it. Not to sure about the native 'aboriginal type dance' a direct copy of the dance performed in the film 'walkabout'. The film in general was well made although I feel that the trademark voice overs of that Terrence mallick has in some of his films can sometimes be a bit too much distracting. This film reminded me of the thin red line in its nature versus violence with lots of deep meaning narratives, which sometimes got in the way but hey what do I know about such things. I just really enjoyed the film apart from the glaring goof at the end!",The New World
505,pmcavena,"Great Visuals, poor direction",2,3 July 2006,"I remember seeing previews for this movie last year, and wanting to see it. It fell out of my memory until a recent trip to blockbuster where I decided to rent it. Within the first minute of the movie I could tell how the style and direction of the movie would ultimately ruin what had a lot of potential. We have all heard this story, its not new to us, but this movie portrays it in some what of a new way although fails to show what could have made this movie great. The movie focuses to much on romance, and not enough on the huge conflict that is present there. While yes the movie does include battles, starvation, amongst other things, its main theme is the relationship between a women and two different men. What makes this really painful to watch it that, the relationship is so boring, no character is established, its too predictable, and nothing really happens, thats really one of the big problems with this movie, the plot is very loose, undefined, and meaningless.This movie suffers from to much pointless narration. Mostly coming from the two main characters, Pocahontas, and John Smith. What they say has little or nothing to do with the story, and does not even do a remotely good job at establishing character for themselves, its pointless, if you want to tell a story cinematicaly, then show it!! Don't try to have the characters recite it for us, it's not a play. It would be different if the narration was helpful at all, but it is completely and underly pointless.Another huge problem with this movie is the editing. I do like jump cuts, and breaks in continuity, but they have to have a point, or benefit the story in some way. In this movie, there are horrible cuts, that break continuity, and have no point. They are obviously mistakes. Some of the characters will be having a conversation, then a cut occurs, and the blocking, lighting, and sound is completely different.My biggest problem, is the direction. In the opening scene, the movement of the ""naturals"" as they observe the boats coming in, is horrible. They are human beings not apes. They dance around almost on their hands and legs like they are animals at a zoo. I understand the director is trying to make a cultural distinction between the Indians and the English, but making the Indians move like half idiots and half apes really reinforced the idea that I was watching a movie, it took me away from trying to focus on the story and I felt as if the movie was very fake.The movie does have some good visuals, and good overall photography, some good steadicam, and some decent acting, however these good things are completely shadowed, by poor story, poor direction, and some of the worst cutting i've ever seen in my life. Saving your money, trust me, go watch a better movie, there are plenty out there.",The New World

Normally preferring action to mush (nothing like a good rugby game!!!), an emotional roller-coaster - from happiness for John Rolfe as the woman he truly loved finally returned his to absolute adoration and then dissolving into an unusual flood of tears as his love dies, but then at least some hope as she leaves him with their son, with who he returns 'home'.

It was too late to read all these comments about this movie. My husband and I are practically glaring at each other with a big question mark on what was going on with what we were watching. It's like we were watching the special features of deleted scenes for 2 hours, like all the good scenes were taken out of the movie (if there ever was). We thought it was as good as the trailer. I felt bad for the producers of this film. Bad choice of a director. TSK! I love the Pocahontas animation and I will just watch it again so as I will learn to like the characters again.

509,WillyBilly069,A Child's Painting,4,19 July 2006,"It was what I expected...really boring and hard to sit through. Colin Farrell's role could have been played by any average actor out there; it was a bunch of voice-over and him walking around in bushes with a smirk on his face. Oh, and that annoying Irish accent of his was...well...ANNOYING! Christian Bale's performance unfortunately was not enough to better this movie in any way although his efforts are appreciated. - The supporters of this movie call it a beautiful piece of art. These people have very bad taste in art, and a poor view of what art really is. I guess maybe they feel special or something when pretending to appreciate the ""wonderful opportunity"" of watching trees and water for 2 hours accompanied with pretty music. Good art MOVES people, this however was completely devoid of any emotional intensity and the love story triangle thing was unconvincing. There wasn't any suspense, there wasn't any real drama, and the battle sequences were far less entertaining than they should have been. I actually believe that many supporters of this movie took simple delight in watching freaky Indian people run around like animals making strange noises. Also, good art INNOVATES, while this is simply an old story (probably not even accurate) that nobody gives a s*** about anymore presented, just like I figured, in a very boring and pretentious manner. - If this is art, it's a child's painting of a sunny day. Now, don't get me wrong, this child is quite the drawer and the picture will certainly get hung on the refrigerator by mother, but if you didn't like it like I, and couldn't wait until it was over, don't worry, it wasn't your fault.",The New World
510,gerardhorgan,"Stylish piece of work, but lacked punch and passion.",7,12 July 2006,"I didn't realize before watching this film that Terence Mallick had directed the Thin Red Line and The New World but it didn't take time to spot the style straight off. I like his approach generally, nature shots conveying meaning, depth and beauty, reminding us of a virgin world that is somewhat gone forever. At times however it felt a bit like a nature lesson. Although beautifully shot, the movie I felt lacked real depth of emotion and tension. I feel that the script, scene sequence and score could have got a lot more out of this film, especially given the locations chosen, it practically sold itself. For instance, in Lawrence of Arabia you have spectacular vistas but also an amazing script, great character development, the scenic shots support the project they are not the project, which was how I felt a little watching this movie.I don't think it is sufficient to rely on 'dreamy' scenes of the principal characters rolling around in the grass, almost touching, lingering looks, shots of sunsets and the wind blowing the grass. I can see what the Director is trying to achieve but I think it would be more effective to carve the relationship of the two principal characters out of a strong script, tension scenes and fraught film score, all of which focuses our attention just a bit more on the tension surrounding the characters, the clash of civilizations, the potential problems they will encounter when they connect and so on.There is no doubt that Terrence Malick is a talented individual, however, the New World felt like a string of beautiful shots that just didn't gel together effectively, a lot of jumping around from scene to scene but didn't quite convey what was taking place between the two principal characters, their love for each other set against the backdrop of one of the most important moments in human history. There was too much of Pochaontas prancing around fields, shots of high green grass blowing in the wind, and Indians to stepping out only to disappear (Thin Red Line-esquire).What was needed alongside the beauty was real punch, drama, tension, passion. I thought generally speaking the actors delivered but I found it hard to understand some of the dialogue, especially the children (Irish I believe) in the settlement, and I am Irish.In saying that the final few minutes of the New World moved me greatly. The music, the cutting of scenes, and the final moment when the music stopped, were inspiring. Incidentally, I found the conclusion of the Thin Red Line moving in a similar way. Unfortunately what preceded seemed a bit light on its feet, I never got a sense of the depth of emotion involved and I couldn't help feeling it was a opportunity lost.",The New World
511,haslap,Do Not Watch This Movie! It Is Very Very Bad!,1,19 July 2006,"By far the worst movie I have seen. It is also stupidest movie about Native Americans I have ever seen. Directors and music composers thumbs should be cut of that they could never write or compose again. The movie was huge disappointment. Characters, hmm, actually there were no actual characters because they were so thin that seemed they had no motives at all and even their little motives like love was not explained at all. It was like all people in movie were empty shells just running around like chickens and actually doing nothing that makes sense. The actor of Pocahontas was just ugly and couldn't act at all and in hole movie she has like 15 lines and her face is in more close ups than Kevin Costner in Dances with the Wolfs. I don't understand how fine actors like Cristian Bale and Wes Studi got in to this movie but I guess they were cheated somehow. Colin Farrell is just awful as always. Bales and Studis characters were so thin and had so little own space that it makes me angry and sad same time.I really wonder what was point of this movie but There were no point! It was like historical art/nature movie. After first 15 minutes you just start to be bored to death and all time you wait that something would happen and some kind of storyline would appear, But It Never Happens! At the end of the movie you think some kind of conclusion with characters shallow motives would happen but it is with so less drama that after I would watch any soap opera and be delighted about how deep are the characters and that at least something is happening.Director! Comoon! Do drama instead of filming trees and goofy people dancing in the field and stop wasting our money. (I am glad that I didn't pay for this movie.)My conclusion was that director Malick should only film nature documents but its true that even in them there are more excitement, drama and life philosophy than in this movie (The New World).Personally I prefer watching Last of the Mohicans 20th time than watching this movie ever again!",The New World

Some directors don't grow (thinking Spielberg) so to me they cannot be artists. Malik is an artist, a genius in the art of film, totally underrated and ignored by Hollywooden, as are all the true greats. This movie is a meditation on love, war, and conquest. It could be Buddhist, it could be Hindu, it could even be Scientology; but its essence is that of the meditation. It floats though the eyes into the mind and into the spirit. I too love this movie - when I watched ""The Thin Red Line"", I couldn't believe I was watching a war movie. That ""war"" movie attuned me to the environmental devastation that was is - in 60's language, ""it raised my consciousness"". I had already hated war, but Malik helped me analyse why. Now Malik attunes me to the conquest of this mystic land. I like far in the north, with many, many trees.

A gloriously rich and colourful preview caught my eye, I wish it hadn't but alas it did and so I watched a bloody awful tragic mutilation of film where I can only presume the editor had a dodgy eye and a gammy hand. The script, from what I can establish, consisted of pointers to the actors to: ""look slightly odd as though someone popped a fish up your shorts..."" to be closely followed by a shot of a tree, a rock, a random puddle or...well those were the choices really. Cinematography was dreadful but it gave me a great laugh at the manic wonders that grace the screen knowing people are getting paid for this ""fish up the shorts"" roller-coaster ride.

514,hyleejn,Not quite the Masterpiece,3,29 July 2006,"My wife and I got ready for this smart, artistic and romantic film that if you kept an open mind and allowed your senses to take in the movie, it would be a memorable experience. From the start of the movie I was blown away by the stunning visuals. Nature, in it's purest form. Where the movie began to lose me was the lack of an epic feel. America seemed to be confined to a river, the fenced in village of Jamestown and an Indian camp that could have been just a mile away. The visual expertise that started wore off quickly... the landscape never changed besides a brief stint of winter.The most important aspect to a movie set in this genre and that appeals to the senses is the musical score. The mood setting music in The New World... is terrible. It truly is. I cringed constantly because the sounds of nature are overwritten with an orchestra that sounds like it's playing for a 1980's B movie. I am neither kidding or exaggerating. And this lost most of my appreciation for what the movie was attempting to accomplish. And, aside from a believable performance by Christian Bale and actress Q'Orianka Kilcher, the rest of the acting was not very good. Colin Farrell had only one look. A confused expression of sadness and loss.If you want to see an entertaining movie about Pocahontas and John Smith, see Disneys animated version. If you want to see stunning, beautiful footage of nature, watch the first 5 minutes of New World, rewind, and repeat.

All I saw in this movie was lots of intense staring. Nobody talks. Ever. The scenery was beautiful, I will give them that. But after 2 hours of sitting through this I had to shut it off I was so bored. There was no end in sight. When I finally forced myself to turn it back on and finish it, I was so angry with the ending I actually started screaming. That's a first. I also dislike the fact that they cast just any Native American for these parts. I recognize many of the actors in this movie and some are Mohawk, some are Sioux, and so on. That's like grabbing anyone who looks Asian and saying they are Japanese. Actually they did do that in Memoirs of a Geisha since neither of the main female characters are Japanese.

Colin Farrel, a lousy actor to begin with, mumbles his way through the horrendous script. James Horner who is usually an asset to a film provides music that is intrusive and overly bombastic.

It looks like I have to write another 7 more lines of text before my review is allowed. That would be more text than what is in the script for Pocahontas. Colin Farrell is terrible, you will need subtitles to work out what he is mumbling about. I can't believe Terrance Malick could do a film like this after A Thin Red Line.

I have never written a film review in the past. I have written to some film-makers, particularly independent film-makers who's work may not have a huge audience, to express my enjoyment of their work, but i have never felt compelled to write a review.

If you are considering watching this work, please don't. Save yourself those precious minutes. This is by far the worst piece of cinema i have ever seen, be it short or feature. It is self-indulgent, poorly written, woefully performed and immeasurably pretentious. The soundtrack is nice and i grant you that there are some lovely shots of foliage, landscape or nature but these shots usually have no bearing on the story and no function other than to add photographic art. Now i'm an actor, and largely an amateur one with a failed professional career. I can recognize a poor film as i've been in enough. I'd be taking this one off my CV if I were in it.

This also was a good thing because the dialogue was in a made-up Indian language that was impossible to understand from the context of the scene. It appeared as if the movie was shot without a script and instead improvised as they went along. The directing also was subpar. It looked like the same scene was being replayed over and over again.

Once again, we have what could have been an excellent portrayal of real life history and events, blasted apart by ""Hollywood"". If Pocahontas and John Smith ever did have a love affair, it would have been DISGUSTING, as the REAL Pocahontas was about 11 years old, ELEVEN people, and John Smith was about 29 years old, so that would have made him a PEDOPHILE, and that is NOT something to make an ""adventurous/love-story"" movie about! And to top it off they had a half Swiss/half SOUTH American 15 year old, play the part of Pocahontas, why couldn't they find an 18 year or older Full blooded NORTH American Indian girl to play the part, against Colin Farrell's 30 year old butt, playing,John Smith? That too was disturbing in itself, First as in insult to NORTH American Native Americans and second in having a under age CHILD play the part.

While I admit that the photography was, at times, quite beautiful, that was the only redeeming feature of this movie. The story was not told, it was shown. That is fine if it's done right, but more often than not, the movie jumped from scene to scene with HUGE gaps of time and story left out in between. I was constantly wondering what had just happened. Then there was the fact that nearly every other scene was of Pocohotas and/or John Smith in a field of tall grass, either walking slowly, running backwards laughing, caressing the other person, or running their hands across the grass. I lost track of how many ""tall grass"" scenes there were.There was very little dialog, which made the story even harder to follow. The narration by John Smith and Pocohontas was always mystical and dreamy and poetic. It added absolutely nothing to the story and was actually pretty annoying. Instead of words, this movie consisted mostly of exchanged looks between characters. But you can't tell a story with just glances/glares/smiles/frowns/etc. between characters. In fact, we should BE so lucky to have seen any sort of emotion exhibited by these characters, except the one scene of Pocohotas sobbing and rolling around in the mud.Maybe I'm one of those people who just don't ""get"" this movie. It seems to be getting mostly good reviews, but when I read why people like this movie, I find myself disagreeing.

As for Colin Farrell the man was obviously depressed when he made this movie which accounts for the total lack of expression on his face, other than a lost, forlorn, lovesick gaze. Kilcher was acceptable in her part. Christian Bale was, apart from Christopher Plummer, the only actor worth seeing in this movie, that had any life to him.

529,laraabrams,A step up from those history videos they used to make us watch in junior high,3,1 February 2007,"""The New World"" is the story of John Smith and Pocahontas, and the events surrounding their courtship when Smith was helping to set up the first permanent English settlement in North America. The story spans the time between Smith and Pocahontas' initial meeting while he is being held captive in her father's village, through her eventual marriage to John Rolfe.I admit that I have not seen many of Terrence Malick's (Director) movies, but I did see The Thin Red Line, so was not completely baffled by his slow-moving, music-driven, dialogue-void imagery to tell stories through impressionism instead of words. This style in such a personal, love-driven story as The New World didn't work for me, because of the feeling of disconnect between the audience and the characters. It was as if they were moving along in their world and I was watching from afar, with no idea what was going on sometimes, and often not caring enough about the characters or their actions. Movies are much more enjoyable for me when I feel like I am a player, right there within the action.My final impression of the film, and what I came away with, is a lesson in history. Granted, a very beautiful lesson in history, but one that was told almost entirely through the thoughts in the main character's heads, instead of traditional dialogue. And, like the history movies that I watched in grade school, I was put to sleep just as easily. This film reminded me a lot of Sophia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" which showed a series of lengthy and beautiful images of the young queen doing various things and going on about her life, but never really reached a point. Was it supposed to be like a reality show, where we step into her life for a few years? Was Sophia trying to absolve her of some kind of blame by showing another side of the historically stereotyped Queen? Call me barbaric and uncivilized, but I like to come away from a two-hour film experience understanding the Director's vision, not wondering if they even had one going into the project.I have to admit, I went in to this film with very low expectations. From the previews alone, I fully expected this film to be nothing but scenes of the vicious white man coming in and gleefully hacking helpless Native American women and children to pieces as he drove them from their lands, which is something that I am very tired of hearing about from folks with political agendas parading as the new historians (especially in Hollywood). But, my soapbox aside, the fact that James Horner had written the music score gave me hope, since he is my favorite composer. The reasons that I plucked this movie from the shelves of Blockbuster were the breathtaking scenery and beautiful love story that the promotional previews promised.I was not wrong about the scenery. Emmanuel Lubezki did an amazing job as Cinematographer. There is one scene early in the film where he makes a stalk of corn look like a priceless piece of fine art. Corn never looked so good. And, Q'Orianka Kilcher was absolutely adorable as Pocahontas, skipping through the fields and innocently curious about all of the changes happening around her. The pair of Kilcher and Colin Farrell made for tasty visuals during long scenes where they discovered each other, while learning each other's languages. The viewer gains an incredibly deep insight into the love between Smith and Pocahontas in a very mature way by listening to the inner dialogue going through their minds, courtesy of hazy voiceovers that make up the majority of the film's dialogue.I was, I am happy to admit, wrong about the slaughter of innocent ""naturals,"" as the Native Americans were called by the English settlers. The treatment of Pocahontas and the Powhatans (her people) is a second or third point in the film, and it was good to see that their strength was well balanced with that of the English. According to the film, the dominant danger that the Powhatans face from the English settlers seemed to be their increasing paranoia brought on by insanity as they realize that they have no idea how to take care of themselves or their new colony in this primitive place.My favorite character in the film, and the only performance worth noting out of all of the various actors, was that of Christopher Plummer in the role of Captain Newport, who comes across as the only one of the bunch who seems to have a plan and a level head for the risky and complicated task of setting up a new colony. Unfortunately, our Captain pops in and out between his excursions back and forth to mother England to offer strong logical speeches that go in one of the group's collective ear and out the other the moment his ship sails away.RATING: Don't Bother",The New World

Most of dialog completely inaudible, leaving one to guess as to names of characters, relationships etc. Development of affection between John Smith and Pocahontas (never called by name)consists of ""meaningful glances"" which could be confused with indigestion. At one time colony seems to be down to about 10 people and then during the battle scene there seems to be dozens, if not hundreds.

538,zarlax,Without Compromise,10,26 April 2008,"I am sincerely befuddled that any serious devotee of cinema can find a significant blemish in the construction of this film. Obviously, his sense of movement and characterization require a certain tolerance for abstraction, but I have rarely seen art in any medium come so close to perfection. All of Malick's cinematic work has been masterful, yet without any doubt his prowess and technique have only blossomed further with each additional effort. Thoroughly, I respect the impatience of many viewers and the subsequent lack of interest regarding the film's exposition and mechanics. However, it is important to differentiate and qualify the criticism of those who are unable to maintain focus from those who actively commit to the experience. Malick will never be as traditionally engaging as more entertainment-oriented directors, but this notion holds no sway over the quality present in his work; the supreme control with which he commands his faculties is astounding and permeates every aspect of ""The New World"". In fact, when considering the level of detail inherent in the film's production it is impressive how naturalistic the film appears. Generally artists lose important aspects of expression in the cultivation of execution, which thereby results in a lack of warmth and soul; thankfully, Malick is seemingly immune to this affliction and created his most intimate and gentle film yet. Other great directors like Kubrick and Lynch have wrestled with the same inverse proportionality in their films. However, both of these men opted to utilize this human detachment for a more disassociated perspective, whereas Malick maintains balance through subtly incisive introspection. It is this delicate thread of understated reflection that binds all elements of his craft into a tapestry of unmatched beauty. The screenplay is simply poetic. I recommend the use of subtitles to those with the inability to hear, or perhaps listen. Attentiveness is paramount. The film is ultimately a soft-spoken essay in perception, revolving around the juxtaposition of culture: co-existence, conquest, and the journey between natural and human order. Deceptively enough, all this is packaged in the context of a historical romance revolving around Pocahontas and her pair of European suitors. Nevertheless, it still succeeds in being one of the better statements concerning love, regret, and the embrace of life ever artificially produced. The design elements and performances committed to film are astounding and the cinematography and editing are unmatched in the pantheon of contemporary American cinema. Ostensibly, this film is a barrage of intricately tempered sight and sound. For admirers of Malick these traits are to be expected, but many casual movie-watchers may understandably find the more overtly poetic elements of the production to be detrimental and irreconcilably distracting. The film is undeniably nebulous with an abstract narrative structure and a disorienting pace, but given careful attention and most likely repeat viewings ""The New World"" will reveal itself in its true form: a masterpiece.",The New World

542,kateri1001,between prince charming and the real man (spoilers),8,31 December 2013,"I remember seeing this movie when it came out and I thought the story and the scenery were wonderful. I felt like I was there when the explorers came, when the New World began.But seeing it again I realize that this is not a movie about the beginning of America, it's a movie about a girl growing up and learning what true happiness is.In the beginning, Pocahontas falls in love with Captain John Smith. John Smith embodies the perfect female dream. He is dark haired, he is an adventurer, a little wild and reckless. Above all, he is charming, or a charmer. ""I made her love me"", he says at one point. He leaves and Pocahontas' heart is broken.Then she meets John Rolfe. John Rolfe is not spectacular. He's an ordinary guy. But he's a good guy. He works in the fields. He wants to marry Pocahontas but Pocahontas is not very enthusiastic about marrying him. She does not feel for him the passion she felt for John Smith. But she accepts and with time, she learns to love her husband.But then John Smith comes back into the picture. Pocahontas learns that he's alive and her attachment to him is revived. In a courageous gesture, John Rolfe organizes a meeting between Smith and Pocahontas while they are visiting London. He wants Pocahontas to be free to choose between him and Smith. There comes John Smith on his horse. But Pocahontas does not see him as she did before. She has outgrown the prince charming. She realizes that the better man for her is John Rolfe. The one that is real and good, kind and faithful.In this sense this movie is an anti-romantic comedy. It is contrary to the typical Hollywood romantic movie where the girl always ends up choosing the great love, in other words, John Smith. There is always a John Rolfe, the poor guy who's not perfect, who has faults, for whom she does not feel passion and who she ends up dumping for prince charming. Is she really going to live happily with her prince? I doubt it because most of the time the prince charming ends up being not so interesting and not so charming.

The shots and most camera angles makes one feel as if they are right there soaking up the same rays and feeling every emotion that the characters are. I do not mind at all the length, yet I think that the scenes in themselves seemed to drag on and then cut and paste themselves where ever they pleased. One moment they're sitting next second they're standing, in and out, out and in. It was very hard to follow at times. There was not much dialog, which was completely fine, but when they did speak it was really important to the next few actions and at times it was hard to hear it. But perhaps that was my own equipment :) In addition, it didn't seem to satisfy my love story needs. It was as if the movie was not one, but two. It may have been that the main focus initially was the princess and John Smith falling in love. Excellent by the way, despite some shaky scenes, the time lapse was exceptional. But then, because of the length of the film, one almost forgets about Mr Smith because of his abrupt departure and by the end when he finally shows back up, one says, ""oh him.. I forgot he was there, wasn't this movie about him and her?"" But alas, it was not. It left me with such pity for him. His absolute depressive and tormented expressions made me feel that he was to commit suicide before the end of the film. Then she goes away and her husband speaks as if he was writing this whole narrative to his son, yet that would only be half the movie. I need to watch it once more and see.

545,xmnbvcxzlkjhgfdsapoiuytrewq1,"Holy crap, this movie takes the cake ...",1,8 July 2011,"... as the most boring movie I have ever seen, beating The Godfather series and The Shawshank Redemption. The majority of the ""acting"" consists of John Smith walking around alone at about 0.5mph, staring at the ground and voicing emo crap in a low depressed voice. Like The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption, anything in the movie takes ages to happen.But the crappiness of this film doesn't stop at the tortoise-like pace. No, many things about the movie just seem like poor choices by the production team:Allusions to the discrepancies between European and Native American cultures were very scarce and have almost no specialized bearing on the actual plot. It's basically an extremely superficial plot placed in a Native American setting.The cinematographic choice of ""jumping"" camera shots in action scenes makes no sense, especially when they remain unfinished (for example, Native Americans start beating up John Smith, and in the next shot suddenly they're ooo-ing and aaa-ing over Smith's compass while he explains its usage in an amiable, conversational manner).John Smith is not a leader in this movie - or least, the movie does a very bad job depicting him as one. As I mentioned before, most of the time Smith is shown sulking around by himself voicing lame emo crap. Other times he is shown playing juvenile games in the wilderness with a childlike interest in the surrounding environment as he peers around with baby-like eyes. Not only does his body language and mannerisms point to a completely clueless wimp, but also he is very rarely shown actually speaking to his own men or commanding them in any fashion. Based on John Smith's character as depicted in this film, it is unfathomable how he rose to and/or maintained a leadership position, unless he suddenly had a stroke and with that a complete personality change.Where the hell are the action scenes?",The New World

The actors fit into their roles very well, but I still think of Mel Gibson when I think of John Smith.

I am not sorry I watched it, but if I had to sit through all of it without my fast forward button, I would grown tired of it, fast.It is not a date movie, an educational movie, a girl night movie or a rainy day cry fest movie.

549,blindtetra,Even bored (and sometimes shocked) a historian.,3,1 April 2011,"As a grad student specializing in colonial America, I was quite a bit surprised catching myself just about to fast forward through this movie (I bought it on Blu Ray even before having ever watched it). The extended version has 30 extra minutes, and yet the movie is at least an hour too long. Let's cut to the chase on what I loved: The architecture of Jamestown was amazing and the director's use of 360 degree shots is wonderful; these, coupled with breathtaking shots of nature that rivals those of top documentaries, I couldn't help wanting to keep watching the movie for more. You could really feel as if you were there.The problem is, that is ALL I had to keep me going. I won't dwell on the editing and storytelling, considering other reviewers covered this problem perfectly. However I might add I had to raise the volume a lot or even put on subtitles to understand what the characters were saying half the time. I have never seen a movie so obsessed with whispering. It's always psss pss pss here and mumble mumble there. Also, the fading in and out of the conversations for no reason was truly annoying. I never knew whether I was supposed to pay attention to what so or so was saying or not. Throughout the movie there is no clear indication on how the audience is supposed to participate or what they should concentrate on. It's a hopeless mess of random cuts, fades, and other ""artsy"" styles that are overused and kill any purpose they might have had being used sparingly. I'm not against nudity, but I do believe in purpose. What's with the random nude swimming women with no context whatsoever besides showing an underwater ass shot? And this shot is randomly flung throughout the movie as if the director is shouting, ""bored? Here's some ass to wake you up!""Back to the history aspect of the movie. (and I caution the reader I specialize rather in French colonialism, and so I can't talk about the events of Jamestown. Though I admit the movie does make me want to read up on it). Though I applaud the job made on Jamestown, the anthropology of the movie is questionable. The initial reaction of the natives upon seeing the ships for the first time angered me. The actors were told to jump around using a certain choreography which, frankly to put it bluntly, made them look like a bunch of angry monkeys looking at a far off banana. I found this view of sloping natives like a half-assed attempt to make them look primitive to the point of being cartoon cavemen. I question Pocahontas's costume which looks more like rags than actual native garment (I'd be curious to see what contemporary image they got that from). They boast in the behind the scenes documentary that they bothered planting primitive corn as it was grown back then (for people who don't know, 400 years ago corn looked more like wheat than what it is today after generations of selective gardening), and yet the main shot of the corn is Pocahontas picking modern corn... Despite the movie makers' claims of the opposite, these natives are indeed portrayed as the noble savage stereotype, in tune with nature. The reality of the matter is that natives never lived in harmony in nature. They survived in nature. There is a big difference. Other stereotypes are also present: I agree that one has to admit to the atrocities committed against natives, but showing Europeans as all being dumb brutes is still being caught up in stereotypes. And might I add captain Newport's comment (I'm paraphrasing) on not ruining America's first day sounds slightly anachronistic? And one final rant of annoyance: why does no one ever talk? I mean, sure you hear a few main characters talk, a few war whoops, but you can't ignore the fact that in the whole Jamestown settlement or the native village, background extra's walk around like a hoard of mutes told to walk straight with no purpose other than to remind us ""Oh, right, there's people living here"".

I loved this actor Q'Orianka Kilcher especially when she was interacting with her hands to express herself , there is no words to how i was touched , she was the driving force behind this movie and i can understand why she would have been so young to capture the true innocence in her >",The New World

It is such a welcome break from the regular, loud, in your face, over the top tag line, poorly acted product that is coming off the Hollywood assembly line these days as regularly as lies out of the white house.This movie is astonishing, it moves with a tranquility and an innocence that I have not seen in long time. It takes it's time, makes you lose yourself in the moment, in the swaying of trees, in the laughter and eyes of lead actress Q'Oriaka Kilcher. Even Collin Farrel, the loud mouthed over the top Alexander that has 'graced' us with his overbearing presence many, too many times, is a revelation in this movie. He is, dare i say it, sympathetic! soft spoken, gentle. Here one can sense what this guy is capable of doing, given the proper DIRECTION. But Q'Orianka Kilcher is simply breathtaking. The freedom with which this 16 year old moves and LIVES in front of the camera will bring you to tears and laughter, all at the same time.I know, how this all sounds, and I know also, that I did not go to the theater to see this movie, but rented the DVD (this is in my opinion due to the poor marketing, or shall I say lack there of which can be attributed to the absence of faith by the studio, that quality is worth a big campaign), but my thirst for a beautiful, not just entertaining, or funny, but a truly BEAUTIFUL movie was finally quenched!

The suffering and ambition of men who destroy the purity and sincerity of a free people. This is not a war movie. It's a movie of God and men. Terrence Malick is a master at deciphering the deepest human anxieties and questions. The philosophy of life, especially life connected to nature is his context, and God is his quest. His films are always for me a reason for great reflection about my life and my motivations. This is not a movie to mediocre audiences, which, unfortunately, are the majority. This is a great reflex of human alienation today, exposed by the deficient capacity of understanding and reflection.",The New World

If they are well done, as ""The New World"" was meant to be, I feel that I am actually living in the Indian village up river or in colonial Jamestown. It is a long movie, as many have noted already, and it not for everyone's taste. However, what made it uncomfortably long for me and what ultimately irritated me was the horrible hack job done by the editor to get it ready for prime time. The editor could and should have cut some of the repetitive love scenes -- we get the idea. But there was so much jumping around between incidents with no explanation about how and why things were happening that I had to turn to my history book to make the connections that should have been in the film, and probably were before it was released. Such a great deal of painstaking effort went into the making of ""The New World"" that I wish the pieces could be put back together so that it could flow as the river.",The New World

There was no discernible segue to a lot of the action. The characters would be speaking yet their lips did not move. It was meant to show what they were thinking but instead of showing their faces and focusing on them mentally speaking, they would jump all over the place and it got very confused. Half the time, you didn't know who was who. Sometimes Pocahontas would be wearing lots of beads and then none. All within the same frame shot.It was a C+++ movie BUT the part where she is presented at the Court of James I of England is worth the ennui of the rest of the movie.Christian Bale does not have much of a role in the movie.The movie should have used subtitles when the Indians ""Naturals"" spoke in the Alongquin language.",The New World

""The New World"" was probably the most mind-numbing two hours I've spent since high school when I had an Al Gore-like biology teacher. The film basically strung together a lot of pictures of running water, green grass blowing in the wind, Native Americans making hand gestures, and colonists dying of disease and living in squalor.The script for this movie must've only been about 20 pages, since there was only about 10 minutes throughout the whole movie in which anyone at all was speaking, interspersed throughout. I was waiting, begging, PLEADING for some semblance of a plot to arise from this drudgery of pretty pictures. This movie seemed like it didn't even try to engage the audience and make them care about what was happening. I might've been better served by reading a history book on Jamestown than by watching this movie; I think I would've cared more for the people and events.Unless you're a historian or are taking some sort of psychedelic drug, this movie is great for taking naps in movie theaters.

It needs a great script, great cinematography, a decent editor and a great supporting cast. This film had none of those. The Pocahontas actress was decent enough for an amateur I suppose (she learned English quite quickly). There was a period in the film where she is separated from John Smith, and told he is dead. There is no explanation for telling her that. Then he shows up later and continues their relationship. She was as confused as I was! The overall story was disjointed in the filming of it. Also, the point of view of the camera was very confusing. Shooting very close on battle scenes and never giving the viewer the bigger perspective. I thought it was going to be an interesting story about the beginnings of America. Don't waste your money or your time (2.5 hours!).",The New World

Guns, Germs and Steel, for a look at how the native populous were overcome by the Europeans.While the main female character was interesting, and the relationship seemed interesting with both men, we did not have the opportunity to get to know them, or the people and the undercurrents behind the actions of the various peoples.

It wasted 135 min of my life. Everyone in the hall seemed to agree with me. A lot of them walked out halfway and now I wish I had done the same. This movie is unbelievably slow and a waste of time. I don't know how it has got such a high rating. Apart from Q'Orianka Kilcher the acting is not that great. There is no dept in character and for most of the movie you are left wondering what's going on.

One just can see how Malick evolves from Badlands to Days of Heaven to The Thin Red Line. Unfortunately I must say that The New World was not what I expected. Its not because of the actors - to my opinion one needs to respect the directors choice for the role, because just he knows how the movie will feel like. Probably, if I had not seen the Thin Red Line, I would of liked The New World. Here also you get the dreamy atmosphere, the lead role voice over and, of course, the beautiful photography. But somehow this movie just doesn't go so far as did The Thin Red Line. Maybe the emotions weren't so strong, maybe the war was the advantage for the Red Line. Maybe. But still, this movie is better than most of the pictures you see in cinemas. Watch it and tell me, maybe I am wrong.",The New World
566,soonerbabe1,a masterpiece,9,17 March 2006,"This film was, in all honesty, not what I expected. I went into the movie theater thinking I would see battles and bravery and adventure, and instead what I found was a sincere and honest portrayal of forbidden love. My heart went out to Pocahontas and her struggle to choose between two men: John Smith, the man she saves from death and thus has an extreme bond to him, and John Rolfe, a kind man who befriends her after Smith is gone. Q'Orianka Kilcher is wonderful in her portrayal of Pocahontas; she can convey a whole rush of emotions without ever speaking. Her face is fresh and curious, and this role could not have been done better. She absolutely steals the show from Colin Farrell (Smith), the supposed star of the film. He does a brilliant job also; his character has immense presence, even though he did not speak very much. I would have liked to see more of Christian Bale,though. His character was kind and generous, but not what you remember from this film. The last scenes in England were the most dramatic- the fog, the grayness, the dull weariness compared to Virginia. Malick is a marvel with his shot selection and the score was very moving.I recommend this to anyone who is tired of seeing the same old Hollywood movie.

567,cre8inator-1,Staggering.,10,29 January 2006,"This film was everything I had hoped for and infinite volumes more. Writer/Director Terrence Malik simply refuses to see film-making as anything short of an art form and handles his brushes (not to mention every frame) with the tender care and command of an artistic master.The warnings are true... if you're looking for standard Hollywood fare, then run away. However, if you were trying hard to remember what film-making is supposed to be about, then this film is an absolute MUST SEE. While it is not forcefully spiritual in its aural narrative, I found this film to be a deeply religious experience in ways that words fail to express.True to form, Malik affords the world of this film as much character as the humans themselves possess. Long stretches of nothing but ambient, nat sounds. Stunning snapshots of the peripheral influences to each scene (i.e. blowing grass, running streams, towering trees). Even an ending title sequence that lives beyond the narrative... breathing the last breaths of a tale that has managed to regularly transcends words.Sharp. Detailed. Purposeful. Bold.

The film somehow returned me to a childhood-like state of innocence and wonder...it made me cry at the beauty of life. And not many films can make me cry. As I was falling asleep in bed with my girlfriend late last night the images Malick painted on screen were still flashing across my mind. The film is like a dream in many ways. Colin Farrell did a wonderful job and he can say so much with his eyes and Miss Kilcher is a revelation for sure. But Malick of course is the real star here.

569,becomethesea,"Great artistic film, bad for entertainment",6,28 January 2006,"""The New World"" is one of those films that you either ""get"" or don't.Despite a serious lack of direction or character development (i. e. if you don't know the Pocahontas story through to her death, you'll probably be confused through at least 1/3 of the movie), not withstanding a TERRIBLE job in editing (many scenes seem literally thrown together), this movie does have its good points.The best quality, for sure, is the cinematography, which is absolutely STUNNING. If you are a fan of seeing pretty images of the moving picture, you'll be very happy with this film. The nature shots are utterly engrossing and are beautifully crafted as the backdrop of 1607 Virginia.Some events are slightly exaggerated in regards to the historical value of the film (i. e. the relationship between Smith and Pocahontas), but these inaccuracies are irrelevant to many of the other historical continuities including (but not limit to) native rituals and life.Another fair quality of this film are the actors involved. With contributions from big names as Wes Studi, David Thewlis, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale and Colin Farrell, the movie-goer should at least appreciate that there must have been -something- regarding the directors vision that was highly appealing to prompt their association with this film. Qorianka Kilcher is delightful in the role of Pocahontas--there are moments in the film when one can almost feel for themselves her inner struggles as the movie progresses. This is a good introductory role for her, and I'm eager to see how her career will develop.Overall, I give this movie 6/10 stars. It isn't wholly terrible--as a film for film's sake. If you walk into this movie with the expectation of being entertained, save your money and either wait for the discount theater or DVD release. If you walk into this movie in the mindset that you are about to witness a quintessential art-flick and maintain an open mind about the directors vision, you just might enjoy it.",The New World

This one lacked levels, and therefore failed merely in terms of acting, retaining interest, and believability. As ""second worst"" movie perhaps it deserves two stars; someone else will have to add the other star, however, because after watching this movie I can't muster the strength.The most persistent problem in this film is, in fact, its star. Farrell wanders from scene to scene with a dazed look on his face, appearing uncertain, downtrodden, and (worst of all) dull. Yet we are to believe that without uttering a sentence, this lifeless soul and Pocohantes fall deeply in love, then overcome cultural and physical walls of separation to be together. And then... well, nothing really. The movie, as sluggish and spiritless as its hero, drags on for a couple hours while you are left wondering when something will finally happen.I watched this movie with three others.

I was amazed to enjoy this movie as much as I did, it's probably one of my ten favorites now. However, I will advise anyone who reads this, this movie is not for everyone. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, and I was even more surprised that it was filmed in my backyard, Virginia. I felt the acting was great, especially on the part of those who played the native Americans. A good word to describe this film would be artistic, much of the voice-over dialogue was incredibly poetic. Much of the movie seemed to be an extended montage, which is something I enjoy. So if you want to dive heavy into plot, be involved in a large cast, and be riveted by extended fight scenes, this is not your movie.

My wife, a die-hard Christian Bale fan, voted to shut it off before he even appeared in the movie. It wasn't worth her time either. The murmuring of Colin Farrell and Q'orianka Kilcher performed to themselves were incoherent at best. The way the film was shot was also hard to follow at parts. 1 second John Smith is with a group of Englishmen, next he is in a small canoe with 3 other men, then he is in the grass with 1 other man, then is in a swamp alone.

It seems that content, dialogue, cinematography, you know, the stuff that makes a movie, decided to take some time off during this crap fest. How long DOES one need to linger on the significance of somebody learning how to say 'Sky' in English? It felt like 20 minutes, and it might have been, since all the scenes were dragged out ten minutes past pain.The director should be banned from having any film that he is involved with from showing in the United States.

I'm a guy and I don't mind romances, but this just went over the edge. I mean I was able to sit through all six hours of Pride and Prejudice and enjoy most of it, but an hour into this movie I felt like I had sat through a six hour home video of two junior highers that had a crush on each other. The only reason I was able to keep on watching this movie was because I kept on hoping that something might happen. The only Plot ""twist"" was when she finds out that John Smith was still alive. Another thing that I absolutely hated was the fact that there really wasn't one historical thing about the movie. John Smith never had a love affair/married Pocahontas. I just can't convey how boring this movie really was. Those who think this movie is a great work of art are probably the same people that think that a black scribble on a white background is great art. To say this Movie is a piece of art is a slap in the face to other art movies like Citizen Kane. Those of you who have not seen it please do not support this piece of trash.

There once was a time, where people lived. They lived so. What did they talk about? What did they dream of? That time is gone, those people are gone. What they talked of is not important. The land is. It's eternal. Malick understands this. Often, his camera will break away from a conversation to look at the grass sighing in the wind. Most of his shots of people are of them walking in the grass, touching them, feeling them, feeling other people, talking by touch. People love each other, they sit together in the grass, stare at each other, smile a lot, touch each other's bodies. They hardly ever talk. Love is an exploration, of the other's body, of the other's mind. Silence is the best language to communicate. ""What else is life but being near you? Do they suspect?

They answered a few of the audiences questions and were very nice.The film itself was enjoyable, especially to those who love a good plot. There are some nice battle scenes that were brilliantly choreographed. Ms. Kilcher's performance was outstanding and for her first film seemed to make it all the more impressive.The New World focuses on Pocohantas' life and the creation of the first colony erected in the early 1600's and how Pocohantas' aided the Europeans. The film also includes the romance between John Smith (Colin Farrel) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale)which really helps to adapt the movie and her performance.I have never seen the Disney movie of Pocohantas but I could easily imagine this movie having a much more in-depth plot and is a very must see.

However, I rapidly began to think that every quotation relating to this movie must have been taken out of context. So I came to good ol' IMDb and was astonished to find a rating over over 3/10 average - such a score can only be the result of studio spamming programs as The New World has to rank as the second worst film I have ever had the misfortune of watching.I get the distinct impression we have a case of the Emperor's New Clothes here, where few people are afraid to run against a cast of largely credible actors, the hard work of getting the film made and the beauty of the scenery. Something that had the potential of Last of the Moh's or Apocolypto fell hugely flat. You can find better scenery in documentaries such as the BBC's Plant Earth or Blue Planet; you can find better scripts...in fact almost anywhere...and the jump cutting during dialogue exchanges which so appallingly gave away the 'cheating' in position of the characters was lamentable. The technical side of film-making should never detract from the viewing experience/story-telling, yet this was so flawed it made it hard to get into what little of a creaking story there was.Overall, this was not a piece of entertainment.

In essence, they don't want to have to think.But then where does cinema get its artistic value? It's not necessarily in how beautifully its shot (although that does help), it's in how much it engages you as the audience. This movie engages you plenty...but only if you're willing to have to think about what the director is trying to say and appreciate it for its simplicity and beauty.Many people will walk out, if you see this in theatres. It's slow, sometimes agonizingly so, but its beauty gives the pace credence. The general plot is of Pocahontas and John Smith, and the landing and settling of Virginia. The story changes directions, and in the latter part focuses on Pocahontas's life rather than John Smith.Let the movie take you, let it guide you, engage your mind -- and you will truly love this film.",The New World

Instead you get a discovery channel documentary on nature. Half the bloody movie is scenes that only show trees. And for those of you thinking there is war scenes in this movie, don't get your hopes up. The amount of action in this movie rounds up to about only 10 minutes tops. The rest is Colin Farrell and Pocahontas hugging each other in the grass smiling narrating rhetorical questions in their minds that get pretty annoying. Now I bet there are some art students out there reading this who are just dying to reply to this by saying, ""YOU Don't UNDERSTAND ART!"" - well, if more than half the people watching this garbage left the theatre I was in, that's got to mean something.

If you are an intellectual, like me, you will particularly enjoy this film. So many people like action films like ""The Island"" and ""Batman"" but I don't. Morons like action -- bang bang boom boom -- as opposed to real cinema. This is real cinema: thoughtful and charming and subtle and moving. If you like ""bang bang boom boom,"" then you should just stay away. Because in appreciating pure cinema there really is no middle ground: either you are an intellectual or a moron. People can't have different tastes, enjoy some non-Hollywood films and foreign films but also like some blockbusters; I mean, that just doesn't happen. What I'm trying to say is that if you are of inferior intellect, you might think this film is boring and pretentious, the cinematic equivalent of Tylenol PM. But I didn't; I could've sat in the theater all day, taking in showing after showing. Actually, that sounds like a good idea: I'm going to quit my job and just stay in my local theater all day long, watching this thing again and again. It was that wonderful.",The New World

In my opinion, the cinematography, script and acting are great. I was impressed with the visual components which harmonically work in lieu of duologue during pivotal scenes. The edit at times seemed a bit choppy, but once I adjusted to it, that also added to the rustic naturalistic quality of the film content and period.The only improvement could have been with the music which I found not only did not support the movie, but was distracting. With the right score, I would have been able to connect all my senses. It is the first film I have seen that the music bothered me as much as this did.",The New World

I walked out thinking I should reconsider my major. This movie turned what could have been an epic into 10 minutes of dialog and 2 hours of watching people walk, just walk. The acting was superb, when they were actually given the chance to act and not just walk. With this cast and story I was hoping for so much, and it in no way delivered. While the cast, costumes, and scenery were all superb it meant nothing. There was no script to give it a backbone.

The story was long and felt rather like staring at a wall, minus the action (as staring at the wall, eventually there might be a fly which crawls on the wall, and that is much more exciting then this film, in fact if this film randomly cut into a sequence of some random fly on a random wall, it would have doubled in action. I am not one to complain about lack of action, as i am highly against Van Damme and anyone else who are responsible for plot less movies, but Has anyone seen BraveHeart?

590,dadgummet,"Bad dialog, music, acting (at times). Good costumes.",1,22 January 2006,"Horrible music. The annoying opening ""discovery"" music which is played anytime there is a new ""discovery"" really grates on one's nerves. It's one harmony crescendoed, that's it, and the so called composer for this movie didn't even write it! And then there is the theme from one of Mozart's piano concertos, a 40 second clip only, which was heard 5-6 times throughout the movie in the most predictable places. Most people who watch this movie and complement the composer do not realize did not write most of the music used in this movie.The dialog, as is in almost all so called blockbusters these days is clichéd. The director used too many shots of the young actress giving us her wonderful smile, used to show her innocence and purity and gaiety. This got old very quickly. We get the point, move on.The people who say it was beautifully shot do not get out enough into nature or watch any nature documentaries on TV. There is really nothing new here that the director gives that you can't get elsewhere in real life or not. If you want to see breathtaking beautifully shot movies then you need to check out Werner Herzog's stuff w/Kinski or Akira Kurosawa to see how it's really done.There is rampant clichéd symbolism such as the bird flying into the sky at the end. I was unaware of the story of Pocahontas, but nevertheless, this story was quite predictable and the emotions of the main characters obvious at all times and predictable. I could go on and on like this movie did, but alas. See it if you want to pat yourself on the back when you're done and curse the philistines who ""don't get it"" or feed whatever superiority complex you may have.Costumes were pretty good, however, it was obvious the studio was going for a PG-13 rating to maximize their profits (although we got a nice glance at Pocahontas' right butt cheek at one point). The battle scenes were a letdown as well due to the studio's desired rating. This could have been a much better film if the director was allowed more realism.",The New World

Hard to tell whether the actors did a good job or not as half the time I did not know what they were supposed to be expressing. I have seen Farrell in two movies and have regretted purchasing both of them. This and Tigerland are two of his pieces of work that I own and they will not get recommended by me for either one.

The movie seriously could've been about an hour long if they cut out all the times when nothing was happening. I sat there thinking...well I'm glad these people can communicate so well! Along with the thoughts, about how disgusting it was for a 15yr old to be making out with all of these actors who are WAY older than her.

Hallmark postcard pictures and dreadfully loud and annoying music.,3,24 August 2006,"If you want to see this movie I suggest that you turn off the sound. Everyone mumbles and the loud symphonic music makes no sense. Just a couple hours of pretty pictures. And not much historical information. Colin Farrell has one expression - depressed. Captain John Smith was and adventurer and explorer. According to this silly movie he was a depressed one. I couldn't understand a single word he mumbled, fortunately Pocahontas, for whom English was a second language had no trouble understand every word he said. This is a story rich with any number of angles but this is how Hollywood contemplates it's navel. Terrence Malick is credited with writing the movie script. I wonder what it must have looked like because the story in this movie could be told in a few sentences! And guess what! This movie was also directed by Terrence Malick and since he reduced a great story to a few mumbled lines he filled in all the time with long gazes at sun rises, sunsets, reflections on the water, the landscape, boats sitting in the water, Q'Orianka Kilcher in her native leather and Q'Orianka Kilcher in old English costume.

594,sagivsome,I Spy Emotion: A challenge for those with the keenest eyes...,2,22 January 2006,"The only reason I sat through the whole thing was because I was too drowsy to move.The New World attempts to be an artistic film as well as historically accurate, but Malik tries to be artistic WAY too much, when he obviously isn't. He shows the ""untouched nature"", which is fine, but I can stare at grass blades for hours for free. I'd rather watch ""March Of The Penguins"", because at least penguins are more interesting than trees and a river.And that was the better part of the film. The first ten minutes were OK, although vague if you don't know what the story is about. Colin Farrel is on a boat and is going to be hanged for mutiny, but for some reason they decide not to hang him. Where the hell are they? Who knows, but maybe the movie will explain later. Anyway, they discover the ""naturals"". This is strike #1 for the quest to find emotional value. So they've met each other, and then what? How do the English feel? How do the Naturals feel? The only answer I can get to this question is that ""They want to take more land"" in the first out of 8 subtitled comments between the indians. And the English build their fort as a precaution.Suddenly, Smith is taken hostage on his expedition! Things are heating up, but are they? There's no comment whatsoever from the colony. Smith grows to be a respected ""member"" of the tribe and falls in love with the girl, very awkwardly I must say. Strike 2- Even in the love scenes, there are no emotions. They love each other, yet there is no emotional interaction.Smith returns to his colony before the winter, to find dirty people living in a craphole. What exactly have they done to deserve this honor? Oh, the President is *mumble mumble taking the food mumble*. 2 seconds later President is dead. Smith is appointed new President and we get to see some people's spit and disgusting teeth. Smith, the plain SOLDIER, on the other hand, has teeth that are nice and perfect. Braces maybe? Winter comes and goes, nothing is happening and then Pocahontas bring some food. How generous of her! Why is this happening? Why are the English STILL starving? Why does the place still look like a craphole? For answers to these and more please visit www.thenewworldmovie.com. You won't find them in the actual film. STRIKE 3 YOU'RE OUT! At this point, it's game over.Smith leaves to England, Pocahontas is kicked out for bringing the English corn and a few people die in a short battle. Why the English and the Indians still live in peace a few minutes after that, I don't know. But Smith leaves and Christian Bale comes in as a substitute, and the last 45 minutes of the film are wasted as any hint of emotion that existed between Smith and Pocahontas does not happen between the new couple, because the feelings are drowned out by... well there is nothing left. The last 45 minutes are just terrible.Some things that could've been portrayed with a few tweaks- -Everybody should have bad teeth, Malik should know better than that. The only three that don't happen to be Bale, Farrel and Rebecca.-This aspect of venturing into a land untouched by the European civilization should have been an important issue, obviously the name ""The New World"" was supposed to relate to something in the film. ""King Kong"" did this really well, although the result was rather spooky and unrealistic. Destroying the land, which was mentioned rather briefly and without emotions (chopping down the trees) and the hardships, which was also very brief and blank, should have had much more focus in the film.-LoveOverall, I give it two yawns up.",The New World

And this film did it beautifully.The dialogue was almost inconsequential - in fact, quite often it was delivered so softly or incoherently that you couldn't follow it anyway. Not a problem. It's the feelings and impressions of the main characters that are ""the story"", not their words. For instance, when John Smith does speak his words lead him astray - his talk of ""dream"" and ""reality"" drawing him ever away from Pocahontas.I came away from the film quite satisfied that I ""understood"" the main characters, with the exception of John Smith - which was probably the intention, as he didn't seem to understand himself.A beautiful, moving and captivating film - highly recommended.",The New World

Those domes you walk into and have a 360 degree screen, showing a first person perspective of a roller coaster ride, followed by a biplane flying through the Grand Canyon and so on? Well if you have, replace the roller coaster and canyon, with scenes of fields, woods, coastline, tribal village and a farm. Watch nothing happening for 2 hours, except those scenes switching, once in a while and you've just seen ""The New World"". Many of the scenes were very picturesque and there's no doubting the cinematography, but the movie has a very poor storyline, dis-jointed, very slow and no ultimate conclusion of any significance.There was very little dialogue. The actors were not required to act because most of the scenes were deliberate moments of nothing much going on, presumably so the audience can appreciate the cinematography some more? When you look at a nice landscape painting, you appreciate it for what it is and eventually move on to the next painting to appreciate that too. This film says ""look at how good we are at filming scenery"" and then says it again, and again and again et al. It totally neglects that a film should be a story and not a collection of visuals with a rumour of a story thrown in to justify more scenery.Many people were bored and quite frankly, that's the main achievement of this film. Sad really, with so many good actors, being asked to do so little.The film had excellent cinematography, but that's it. A good film contains more than just showing the ability of the camera crew. It needs a good story, accompanying dialogue and good actors delivering believable performances.This was a natural history slide show, nothing more. Don't watch it.

597,tammyandchris2,a cinematic Visionary,10,9 February 2006,"Terrence Malick has put together a cinematic Visionary, yet Big Mammas House 2 rakes in 12 million over the weekend. It is a shame that many people will not see The New World. I don't know if it is the fact that New Line Cinema did a pathetic job at marketing it, or we as Europeans are too guilty to see what we have stolen from the true Americans. Once again we have swept it under the rug like we have been doing for so many decades. Terrence Malick has put together a work of art that many will unfortunately not see. First let me start off by saying that once again like The Thin Red Line,the cinematography is extraordinary. I felt as if I could touch the nature surrounding me. This film is more like a mode of transport in every sense of a masterpiece, because Malick is so effective with his use of the photography, sound, and minimal dialog. The soundtrack is such a great combination of nature , and an epic score done by James Horner. This is his best work since TITANIC. In all sense , this is a romance. Not only Smith and Pocahontas' love of each other, but the Romance of America. I have never had a film effect me emotionally in so many ways. I cried in sadness, and in joy, as well as feel anger and disgust.I fell in love with Q'orianka Kilcher's Pocahantas. Why she is not nominated for best actress is a crime. And when we first see Pocahontas wearing European clothes and trying to adjust to walking in shoes, It was a true feeling of disgust and sadness. It was like a symbolic breaking point of European take-over, and we as viewers have to decide if Pocahantas has lost a sense of who she is. Bottom line this story celebrates the life of Pocahontas, and is told and filmed very much like a poem. Many people are going to skip this movie because of the very thought of a 2 and a half hour poem, but for me, I was sad when it ended because I did not want to leave The New World.",The New World
598,josie_suicide,The New World killed my soul,1,29 December 2005,"This wasn't just a BAD movie. Bad movies are those ones that you leave the theater thinking, ""Oh that was bad"", but then soon forget about them. This is like the AIDS of movies: it's going to stick with me for the rest of my life.It starts off artsy: lots of water scenes and grass blowing in the wind. Everything about this movie was S L O W: dialog, editing and even walking. I wanted to yell at them all to go faster.So, Colin Farrell spends every scene looking like he's going to cry. Why are you so upset, C Fer? Maybe it's because you're a terrible actor? After moping about and wandering through endless fields, he meets Pocahantas, except they never say that name, so who knows, maybe her real name was Jezebel.C Fer and Jezebel sort of hit it off, but C Fer keeps moping, touching the grass for some inane reason.And to top it all off, there are these ridiculous narrative voiceovers that they played so you could hear them talking while less interesting stuff happened.C Fer gets captured by the ""naturals"" and stays with Jezebel's tribe and falls in love with her, which we learn through stupid pointless voiceovers.They spend the whole first two thirds of the movie rolling around in the grass and giving each other looks and wandering through the woods.Geez, you say you love her C Fer; why the long face? He claims that he's not ""good enough"", but all you need is love.He fakes his death instead and she is devastated and taken in by some chick named Mary who teaches her about being a good British girl and names her Rebecca.Finally after like seven hours of C Fer and Jez Rebecca, Batman shows up. Now, Christian Bale's character is John Rolfe, but not ONCE did they actually say his characters name.I figured Batman would finally kick some butt, but NO, he falls in love with Rebecca instead.How do we know? More ridiculous voiceovers.Then they walk around in the fields for like twenty minutes.It's around the point where we see lots of pointless scenes: cow petting, chickens clucking, trees blowing, fields of wheat and I notice that people are leaving...with their jackets...and not coming back.Jezebel decides to marry Batman because she thinks C Fer is dead. And suddenly, BOOM - a baby appears. No sex, no pregnancy, just a baby. Talk about good pace. Everything is so slow and then suddenly a baby appears.Then that baby is five and they're heading to the New World to chitchat with the King and Queen. Except Rebecca finds out that C Fer is alive! She's all torn and tells Batman that she's promised to him and Batman is sad.And then, the most pointless scene of all: C Fer on a beach with some natives up in Newfoundland. He doesn't say a thing; just looks around all sad as usual for about 20 seconds and then it goes back to the real story.They go to England and more pointless scenes ensue, including one of a native who tells Rebecca he is going to put a notch in this tiny stick for every person he sees in England.Yea, dude, you better get a tree, because last time I checked, there were a lot of people in England.So, they meet the King and Queen and it starts to pick up pace. Director probably realised that some people were committing suicide by now and it was time to wrap it up.But no, not just yet.First another pointless scene with native-with-stick wandering around a garden looking amazed.Second, Batman invites C Fer to his house because he wants Rebecca to choose her man. Batman tells Rebecca this and that's when I notice the dog in the background.I noticed the dog because I was looking for SOMETHING else to look at besides the movie. Now, the dog wasn't moving. He was sprawled out and wasn't breathing. Then Batman walks off right PAST the dog and it doesn't even flinch. Not even a twitch of an ear.The movie was so bad that it killed a dog. Didn't anyone notice? Oh yea, but lets not forget the riveting movie: Rebecca and C Fer spend another ten grueling minutes walking slowly around, very uncomfortable with each other, sort of giving looks. C Fer's were all ""I missed you"" and Rebecca's were like ""what did I ever see in you?"" Then Rebecca just walks off and sort of nods goodbye. Couldn't she have just done that before wandering around aimlessly for so long?Rebecca finds Batman again and tells him that she picks him and I was thinking that it was finally over.WRONG.Five more minutes of Batman, Baby Batman and Rebecca playing in the fields; five longer minutes of Baby Batman and Rebecca playing tag, then Rebecca gets sick and dies and then you see two minutes of Rebecca running around the backyard splashing herself. I am going to assume it was her ghost, but I'm still not sure.But wait, she's dead and it's STILL not over.We get to see Batman and Baby Batman get on the boat and head back to the Sort Of New World.Then some water shots.Then some forest shots.Then some more water shots.And then a final tree shot that lasts for fifteen seconds and...FINALLY FIN I really wanted to shout at the screen I was so pained. So I beg all of you not to see it. Or, maybe you should so you all will understand my pain and suffering.",The New World

I know some will give me the ""open mind"" and ""it makes you think"" answer. But a little dialog wouldn't hurt.Pocahontas story was a great opportunity for a great film. This one was realistic, captured the mood of the conquerors and the natives. but It didn't have too be so boring. Three good actors leading, but not a chance to see a good characterization. At 135 minutes I think i think that it's 45 minutes too long.

The stroke of genius about The Thin Red Line was its mixing of this slow paced absorbing approach with the white knuckle riding, fast paced editing of the war scenes: beautiful, but dangerous at the same time! The New World however seems to have missed out the danger and gone for a simple depiction of do-cu-drama styling. Thats fine if there's something to see... The starvation and slow death which plagued these early settlements in the colonies doesn't exactly make for riveting viewing.How the mighty have fallen? Well, like Wolfgang Peterson (Troy?

It will drive you insane because they will stare and stare at each other but no one will talk. They just stare. I must say that with the talent of his actors Malick failed as a director. This movie is to flat. The trailer made it look like an action adventure when it is more like a documentary on the nature channel. Please save you money and the two and half hours of your life.

They made the Indians in this movie out to be maniacs who yodel, the writers were not even respectful enough to let the Natives speak an actual language. They were portrayed as animals in humans bodies. There were absolutely no humorous scenes, no romantic scenes, no cute scenes and no scenes with a purpose to contribute to the non-existent story-line.

I knew nothing about Terrence Malick's work and so came in with no preconceived ideas about what his work would be like. I will admit that Colin Farrell is not my favorite actor and I was slightly suspect of what his acting might be like. I am not a professional film critic, and so will not analyze the film at such a level; there are plenty of people on this board who have already done so, and well. I will simply say that I left the theater stunned. The cinematography was beautiful, Q'Orianka Kilcher was astounding, Colin Farrell was great.

The love story, the discovery, the encounters of different cultures. The pace and balance of the movie was good, and not slow. The character of Pocahontas was not only well played, but the substance of her story was beautiful and brought me to tears several times. It was an Oscar performance if ever there was a place of honor for acting. Yes, this is a movie I have enjoyed more than any in recent memory. I don't expect everyone to ""get it"", and that is OK.

Obviously there are gray areas in 400 year old history, but here we have glaring omission and blatant fabrication.We do know that John Smith left the colony because he injured himself hunting. Not portrayed. The relationship between Pocahantas and Smith is overdone (she was only 11 when they met).

606,wheelerc00,The New World - Good or Bad ?,3,25 June 2006,"Yo yo yo, I have watched films for years and know a lot about the meaning, making and general message that film makers try to convey. I have studied film studies in depth and understand every aspect of film-making, camera work, cinematography and editing and everything else. But 'The New World' just doesn't do it for me, it is too slowly paced and doesn't contain enough action.I must admit that this film conveys fantastic editing and camera work which works fantastically without the use of action and words, but the direction of the film lacks serious location. Sometimes, the film lost me in terms with understanding, but after seeing it, i had knew what it was about. My favourite actor is Colin Farrell and i wanted to see this film because of his role. But after watching this film, i was really disappointed in his role and the film as a whole. Maybe i expected this film to contain more action, fighting, and talking, but its main theme of silent imagery didn't do it for me. I don't think the quiet romantic role suited Colin Farrell, in comparison with his bad boy image and other roles in S.W.A.T, The Recruit, Phonebooth and his newer film Miami Vice which looks fantastic. This for me, decreased my overall enjoyment.The director did a wonderful job in terms of what he wanted to do, but lacked elements of description, explanation, action and amount of character conversation, which had a massive impact on my overall view. The film doesn't tell the audience how Smith ended up there, or anything about his life before. If you enjoy films with silent meaning, and like the element of love contained within, i would recommend this film, but to the average movie - goer, this film's a no-go. this is definitely a silent movie!Thanks for your time, regards, Chris wheeler x",The New World
607,ddade,Q'Orianka Kelcher is a phenomenon,9,25 June 2006,"Hers was the most powerful performance I've seen in a good, good long time. She can more clearly state what her character is thinking using her eyes and face than if she had actually spoken. I am dumbstruck that this was a 14 year old girl in her first major production; My only regret is that it is unlikely to see her execute such a mature, and subtle role. Instead of Christian Bale (who also made a believer out of me with this film), to see her opposite a lesser leading man in a blockbuster with explosions and car chases would offend me deeply. This movie fulfilled the contract with the viewer that says if you just willfully suspend your disbelief for a bit, I will take you somewhere or somewhen you've never been. Q'Orianka was largely responsible for that. This movie blew me away, and I hope to see this amazing actress again soon in a worthy role. Perhaps the next Fast and Furious?",The New World
608,jessica787_,They don't make many like this one.,7,25 February 2006,"I know there are many mixed feelings about this movie but after leaving I felt it was very satisfying. The storyline was unique, actors-realistic and scenery/cinematography was pleasing. It is however one of those movies that you either like it or hate it. It's not recommended for those who need strong story lines or plots to be captivated by a movie. Great break-through role for Q'Orkianka Kilcher who for being only 15 does very well as Powhatan's prized daughter Pocahontas. I also enjoyed watching the way some Tribes lived in the 17th century, free from many of the disturbing traits common in the Americas. There were (I felt) a few loose ends but nothing serious. In the end I was happy with our choice in watching this movie.",The New World
609,silversphere,Gorgeous,10,31 July 2006,"The New World is undoubtedly the most gorgeous film I have ever seen! Stunning scenery, a brilliant score by James Horner, incredible performances by all involved, not least of all Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas. She has extremely expressive features, which never fail to draw out the emotions of her audience. Every frame of this movie is absolutely breathtaking and I doubt that I'll ever tire of any moment of this film. I love how eloquently Terrence Malick tells the story of John Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe. When our characters are happy and free, we are happy and free, when they are tortured, we are tortured, and we have enough perspective on each character to avoid being judgmental. I can't get the scene out of my mind with John and Pocahontas standing on opposite sides of the fire outside of the fort as Pocahontas pleads with John to ""come away."" This movie tears me apart piece by piece before it fills me to the point of bursting! By far my favorite movie.",The New World
610,dlou2005,The Should-Be Front Runner for Best Picture,10,23 January 2006,"""The New World"" is a perfect fit for Terrence Malick's film-making style. He is the film equivalent of Ansel Adams with his astounding ability to capture beautiful, natural landscapes. Malick begins the film with a lot of landscapes and shots of the English settlers surveying this new land that gives the viewer the feeling that they are seeing a foreign land for the first time. The pacing at the beginning of the movie is admittedly slow, and and remains at that pace for most of the movie. This pacing works on every level since the film covers three developing relationships; that of the settlers and the land, Pocahantas and John Smith, and Pocahantas and John Rolfe. The film's relationships are also beautifully written. John Smith is truly infatuated with Pocahantas and the native culture. When they interact Pocahantas is often seen running freely through the grasses and they are often alone acting outside of the constraints of their colliding cultures.John Smith is also dealing with the inherent beauty in not only Pocahantas' character, but the culture that the natives inhabit. Although they are primitive and the British are clearly more advanced, Smith acknowledges that what they have is unique and he is ambivalent towards the British intention to colonize their land and although he truly loves Pocahantas and the Indian culture, his eventual decision to leave her is made with her interests in mind and an unwillingness to end a freedom that only exists in the environment she has grown up in.The romance between John Rolfe and Pocahantas is a stark contrast to that of Pocahantas and John Smith. Rolfe is the consummate British colonial force, a tobacconist in the New World to further his fortune and status. He has no consideration for what his love for Pocahantas could mean for her and consequently she is taught English, begins to wear dresses and high heels, and converts to Christianity before their eventual marriage. Although this can be seen as advancement, and undoubtedly is, the vibrant, inexplicable, raw quality that she previously possessed nearly disappears, clearly stifled by British colonialism.The settlers colonial efforts and battles with the native tribes mirror these events, and although a sidebar to the film's relationships, also help to establish the film's themes. Malick's choice to shoot the film on the rare 65mm film stock not only makes this a unique and beautiful viewing experience, but significantly aids in establishing the native culture's inherent beauty.Colin Farrell and Christian Bale both do very good jobs with their respective characters, but the shining star is Q'Orianka Kilcher. The film really settles on her shoulders and both her and Malick deserve credit for this performance that is almost silent, yet perfectly embodies the qualities unique to her people. Watching the changes in her mannerisms from her interaction with Smith to her relationship with Rolfe creates pathos both for her and for her tribe.This film is immensely rich and the film's ending beautifully captures Malick's observations on the end of this culture. Yet, as the credits began to roll the cinema - goer's around quickly began laughing and/or complaining. For a passive observer this film is a complete bore, but to one open to a journey that is established visually this film is easily the best release of the past year.",The New World
611,gmeeper,Forget a second look...not worth a first.,1,23 January 2006,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Maybe that's because I was expecting a historical action movie (like The Patriot or Braveheart). This turned out to be more like one of those bizarre Estee Lauder commercials.Over 60% of the movie is in voice overs. A typical scene from the movie has the couple (Ferrell/Kilcher or Bale/Kilcher) running/working in an open field asking questions like ""Where are you my love?"" or ""How will I know if you love me?"" Even for an romantic film it was crappy. The remainder of the movie that is not voiced over is whispered, spoken with thick accents, or in Native American dialects (with no subtitles) that make it nearly impossible to hear. One of the few American films that actually should have had subtitles.The film was so weird that when it ended no one in the theater said a word. Usually there is some chatter/discussion while exiting. Not here. Everyone just got up and left quietly. It was like leaving a funeral home.Bottom line -- don't waste your money or time unless you're punishing yourself for something.",The New World
612,sixeightabc,Boring -- Waste of DVD Rental,4,20 September 2006,"I rented this movie because I read a lot of historical novels about ancient native Americans and thought this would be interesting and would give me a better feel for some of the time periods. Cinematically, it was LOVELY. Plotwise and acting-wise, however, I just about fell asleep. I think what bugged me most was that the main characters rarely, if EVER, spoke above a whisper. Much of it was a reflective inner monologue, but does the ENTIREMOVIE have to be that way? The actress playing Pocohantas never spoke a SINGLE WORD so much as she simply breathed them. Who DOES that (unless they have a severe disability)? Even Colin Farrell's character rarely spoke in anything approaching even a normal ""indoor voice"". Trust me, closed-captioning is ESSENTIAL to watching this movie. Except for some physical clashes (where MOST of the Indian characters were, at least, QUITE vocal) and an occasional distressed person at the settlement, the entire movie was passionless in every respect.",The New World
613,inguk_cha,the real world,9,1 February 2006,"'The New World' holds no prisoners, the film from start to finish respects the subject matters it touches but also respects the audience. Not since Tarkovsky and Bresson, have i seen so unrelenting film making, giving no clues to the audience but respecting the intellect of the audience by dispensing back story and by encouraging lateral thinking. The film should have come with a warning: art film hidden under the guile of a Hollywood epic! or 120 million dollar art film! For without these warnings, people may misinterpret the film to be something that its not. I was a little confused after watching the movie. Did Malick want us to think that these people were America's first settlers, which provided a foundation for the America of today? or that the story of John Smith and Pocahontis happened in this manner? No he didn't! We in 2006 know what happens with the aid of history, therefore as Pocahontas leaves America in the film, so does our focus. The new world, is no longer valid, we know what will happen, we can make up our own minds, Malick knows this, therefore we go to England with Malick to explore and strengthen the other main theme of the film, love. Love has many layers, the way this film approaches love is no different. Of course the film deals with the love of the land and that of nature. But in this film, I see love as a person, a being that engages, explores, learns and therefore decides. Her love has matured or comes to a full circle, she has become enlightened, therefore her death is not mourned but expressed positively, by the chorus, the chorus of nature, of the wind, the water, the trees... The film is real, the film is truth, this is strengthened by the cinematography, the colors aren't filtered for a reason, the colors look like that of colors produced by our own eyes when we see similar things. We aren't meant to be transported to a higher plain as in Thin Red line but we are meant to feel and be directly involved. The problems of Thin Red Line are eradicated in 'The New World'. The film although representing major themes feels highly personal, they don't feel like pawns dictated by one emotion or light to embody a whole, but feel human, going through many different emotions and decisions.",The New World

The dialog is minimal but the story clearly develops it's absence. The performances are strong, but I do wish a bit more had been explained.

I must have missed the point entirely, if there was one. I suppose it was something about love, but that point was butchered before it was displayed. I daresay I could scribe every word of dialogue contained in this movie on a single scrap of paper. The actors all moved slower than a zombie in a low-budget horror film made by stoners. The only description of the movie I can offer is that it's a type of high-end, college indie-film art project on steroids. This film could easily be substituted for your sleepy-time nature sounds CD. There was plenty of nature to be seen, tranquilizing and beautiful, and you're better off focusing on that than the story. If you watch this movie for a good plot, you'll find yourself choking an employee at your local video rental store, demanding your money back, and screaming, ""Why, dear God, why?"" The only emotion I could convey in relation to any of the characters was flat-out aggravation. I did not feel sorry for anyone in the movie, because any time any misfortune occurred, I found myself thinking, ""Well, that probably would have gone better if the stupid bloke had just said something instead of staring at the camera with complete apathy."" This movie inspired me to do nothing more than hate it. I will never forget ""The New World"". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen.",The New World

There was much Indian conversation and so few subtitles, one had a hard time understanding what was going on. So little historical information was given, one had to work way too hard to figure out the plot. A great concept for a story, but not handled as well as it might have been.

He gives us a rare sense of humanity and love and displays naked feelings vividly and honestly to us, letting us feel them ourselves, without the use of worn-out cliché's. With amazing footage, powerful music and very sharp editing, he manages to say so very many things with the use of so very few words. Outstanding and utterly beautiful! This movie may though not suit everyone. It is extremely special and you need to have a mature viewing-eye and patience, in addition to the ability to give yourself to the story and the experience of it.

The flashbacks and scene changes are choppy. The silent pauses, though meaningful, get very tiresome when they have been used between Pocahontas, Captain Smith, and John Rolfe for about, literally, the twentieth or thirtieth time. I'm not sure if it's a reflection that the Native Americans weren't disposed to verbal conversation, or verbal conversation was not common between Native Americans and whites, but it weighed down the movie and slowed its pace, making for a bored audience.Unless there are closed captions, those who are not used to British accents may find it hard to catch lines when they are spoken quickly and/or sound distorted. Subtitles are lacking, although it may have been intentional to show how clueless the white settlers were in dealing with the Native American language.Q'Orianka Kilcher, who along with another actor who played the part of one of the Native American warriors, was available for a Q&A session after the movie, did a superb acting job for her age and relative experience.

We do suspect it is a Terrence Malick film, however, and during the next two hours+ of 65mm nature photography, hushed voice-overs, elliptical editing, jump-cut storytelling, hyper-attentive sound, and scarcely little dialogue, we become convinced of this fact. Like Malick's previous films (especially The Thin Red Line), World is about the raw and unique experience of cinemain all its sight, sound, and splendorrather than simply ""storytelling on a screen."" Indeed, plot is far from the focus for Malick, who is much more interested in philosophy, metaphysics, and the art of film-making.

However, that's the full extent of the positives.The script is so thin, so hackneyed and yet so portentous that it is difficult to believe it is the work of a man regularly venerated as a genius. In all its characteristics it most resembles the witterings of an angst-ridden teenager. Yawn as all three major characters spend more time speaking in voice-over than dialogue! Look confused as you attempt to keep up with Farrell's ever changing accent! Try not to laugh as Pocohontas impersonates a deer in a field as Farrell looks on with adoring eyes! Try not to get annoyed as you realise that Malick has cast the ugliest actors he could find to play the baddies! Boggle as you realise how trite the voice-overs are! Fall asleep as you give up expecting the film to become meaningful after two hours and just sit there waiting for it to end.The clumsiness of its visual and linguistic imagery has never been exceeded in any film I have seen in thirty years. It is patronising, stupid and vacuous at every turn. After one character compares human beings to trees, Malick cuts for thirty seconds to... a tree! When Pocohontas is presented to King James she is presented along with... caged animals from America (can you see what he's aiming at?)! When Pocohontas is unhappily reunited with Farrell it takes place in a perfectly clipped and bordered English garden (do you think he's trying to compare the American wilderness with the Old World's control over nature?).I do not expect to see a worse film in a long time, and if, as seems likely, it goes on to win any kind of award or plaudits from reviewers, it will be the worst case of The Emperor's New Clothes ever to be inflicted on the film industry.",The New World

636,cat_from_heaven,Pointless,1,7 January 2006,"It might win an award for worst drawn out and pointless movie. I sat through half of it trying to figure out what it was all about, and then the other half wondering why they titled it ""The New World"", it should have been titled Rebecca, really, or something along those lines. Or, at least, had ended earlier. If you're going to make a movie about a certain person, then stick with that person, same goes for place. I almost left the theater in disgust at the length and pointlessness of some of the scenes. Yes, it was beautiful, but that doesn't mean that it had to last that long, and then the story completely forsakens the Natives. Just not the sort of thing one expects from this sort of story.",The New World
637,karmapolice101,A beautiful film but ultimately disappointing.,7,1 June 2006,"A film by Malick is a rare event indeed. Someone who is more secretive than even Stanley Kubrick and whose films only seem to appear every other generation. This is an Epic-ish story, with big production values and scope. From the front cover of the DVD and use of two major Hollywood stars an idea occurred that this would be a ""watering"" down of Malick's Vision and intent or that he himself relaxed his singularly art house style of film-making. Well its not to be, if people watch this film expecting gorgeous visuals, plenty of battles and polarised good and bad characters the are only have right. The film is beautiful a testament indeed to the prowess of Malick and Emmunuel Lubezki the cinematographer. One is in no doubt who the maker of the film is and one only needs to watch the Thin Red Line to see what Mailick can do with budget, stars and genre.Simply put I was disappointed with this film as somewhat with TRL. While Mailick can no doubt make films that are, breathtakingly beautiful, poetic and dreamlike, he leaves me wanting. Despite the long run time, there is no drama, no sense of momentum, we never know what drives these characters or what their fears and limitations are. Any exposition in the film is handled clumsily and bluntly almost like an afterthought. Malick again makes use of the same cryptic voice-over in an attempt to give the film as sense of coherence. I have praised this film for its look and sound but Malick has already remarkably demonstrated his virtuosity in previous films as well as the pacing, themes and use of voice-over. Not to mention the interminable but gorgeous shots of nature.Farrell smoulders as a brooding Irish/Englishman. Though his role does not require him to do much else than stand around and look like he is in a state of perpetual spiritual dismay. Christopher Plummer a fine actor is badly underused. Christian Bale is also a ""face"" in the picture. Of all its Q'Orianka Kilcher who comes out best. With a spirited enchanting performance which is all the more remarkable in that she was fourteen when the pic was shot.As to the handling of the material we can look at it two ways. The film can be praised I guess for not turning into a cartoon were good and bad is polarised and the film acts as one critic pointed out as a movie were the cast and crew have already read a history book. However at the same time we can call the approach timid, naïve and uninterested. Even at times when one feels Malick is maybe being ironic or critical we are not sure because of the arch style and a withholding of any clear intent. One can also say the film resides in a dreamy inertness throughout.Of course this may be the very reason why people prise this film. One can indeed marvel and respect the way in which Malick has be able to present the film though one feels it encountered problems in the editing (it has up to four credited editors). To be fair though, of a lot of recent movies I have seen I would welcome a chance to see this again to see if one's opinion changes. While the film is a masterpiece of vision and sound, its disappointing in its delineation of character, incident and story.",The New World
638,kevin-1044,"Pretty, but shallow and careless",4,4 June 2006,"This is a director mesmerized by his own brilliance. He has abandoned any pretense of conventional story-telling to create ""mystery"" (read: confusion) and ""meaning"" (read: pretension). There are scenes here that are purely symbolic but add nothing to the story. There are other scenes that just seem to float in space.I hated the interior monologues which were meant to give the story depth, yet did nothing to reveal the true character of John Smith, who ended up as much an enigma as he started. (Credit Colin Farrell with another brooding, shallow performance - his specialty.)Worth a look, I suppose, but overly long, uninvolving and ultimately self-indulgent .",The New World

Malick uses natural and human landscape to tell a story like no one else.He could not have found a better Pocahantas than Miss Kilcher if he had gone back in a time machine and captured the original. She has a natural talent for expressing powerful emotions without a lot of elocution. Her interactions with Farrell and Rolfe are as powerful as they are economical. I don't' think she speaks a thousand words in the entire movie, but she tells her story brilliantly.A one-of-a-kind movie.",The New World

This is one of the most slow-moving, melodramatic, contrived, over-the-top costume, cinematographic over-kill movies I have ever seen. Thank goodness someone had the sense to cast Christian Bale so that the film at least grabbed your attention for the short time he was on screen.

642,mike-3123,THE NEW WASTE OF TIME -- Malick = Dangerous Filmmaker,2,30 January 2006,"I'm not sure exactly what it is people fall for about this movie, but they are being duped. Last night, at least 13 people (grown people) walked out on this film before it ended. I would have walked out as well, but I wanted to see the credits to see who exactly was responsible for making this film.The only way I can describe this film experience is TOTALLY DISENGAGING. Malick takes one of the most romantic stories in American History and turns it into this fluttering and extremely sporadic, on some levels confusing melodrama which leaves you wondering by the end ""WHO CARES""?. A filmmaker is supposed to engage the viewer through the tools in his arsenal, Malick pushes me away, he breaks off the engagement very early on (the opening credits actually). But to say that this movie confused me is to say I lack the mental capacity to understand what's going on. This is not true, I know exactly what was going on, but Malick's directing style miserably failed me on this, at every turn when he is able to give the viewer a little information, he does not, his characters remain silent, they act with little or no motive and events happen without you knowing they happened until it is over (I won't get specific). HE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE! I'm not one to ""disrespect"" another filmmaker's style, but in this case, Malick lacks any sense of how to shoot a movie that doesn't make someone want to vomit. YES VOMIT, and not figuratively. Within the first ten minutes of the film I realized WOW this guy doesn't like to use a tripod: EVERY single shot save maybe 2% is shot hand-held... Working with a few million dollars in his budget, I'm not sure what made him not want to use a few thousand dollar tripod and/or more tracking shots that wouldn't make the frame jump around uncontrollably, confusing ""my eye"" so much that I just wanted to shut them.Yes, maybe he is trying to instill an uneasy feeling in us by not letting the camera rest steadily, but once and a while PLEASE put the camera down and give our eyes a rest! Where did you go to film school Malick? This is elementary.The way this film was shot is nothing less than infantile; Malick has a very immature sense of how to take all the shots of his film, put them together, and make something that is both A) Interesting and B) Understandable in the sense that his characters actually have a story a viewer can follow, let alone care about. In that sense, the film lacks a tremendous amount of depth, John Smith comes to Jamestown, falls in love with Pocahontas, the natives want them to leave. Very little else happens in this film that provides any amount of texture or depth on top of (or beneath) the love story. His shot selection goes ALL OVER THE PLACE, using jump cuts where they really aren't needed, going back and forth through time, having Collin Farrell randomly walking through the woods over 4 dozen times. that's about 50 times! Are you ready to see Collin Farrell walk aimlessly through woods for 30 minutes of your day? I wasn't.I think there were MANY people who saw the coming attractions and trailers for this and were impressed, me being one of them. This is why I feel so very cheated after actually spending money on this; Malick literally failed us on this one and IF he put as much thought and time into making the film as they did the commercials for it, they would have had a film that would have stood the test of time. As is, they are lucky if this movie doesn't go straight to HBO this summer.Oh and THE most annoying part of the experience, for a film which boasts having its own score, they choose to play Mozart's Piano Concerto no. 23 4 times!!! Can you imagine if in GREASE we had to watch John and Olivia sing ""YOU're THE ONE THAT I WANT"" four whole times? It would be unheard of, and by the end of the film when they play it one last time I was ready to walk out of the theater in disgust.The only part I thought was innovative was how Wes Studi becomes the explorer for his people in ""his"" new world (England), which was John Smith's old world. It's an interesting trade off that Wes Studi (excellent actor) makes come alive very well, perhaps the first and last bit of depth Malick gives this film.And please, don't think my scorn for this film is unwarranted, I gave this movie MANY chances and Malick fails to deliver on all levels. If you enjoyed this movie you are the type of person who thinks COLD MOUNTAIN is a great film, right?",The New World
643,GracieRose2124,don't waste your money,2,17 January 2006,"I also got a free ticket for an advanced screening of this film. From all the previews, the cinematography looked beautiful, and, as I'm somewhat of a history buff, I knew the background story was interesting... all in all, I was excited to see the movie.An hour into the movie, I was literally sitting there with my eyes closed thinking ""hmm...this is nice nap music."" The only reason I rated this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because the cinematography did hold up...it was beautifully done. And the costuming and location were very authentic. Other than that, the movie left a LOT to be desired. The script was TERRIBLE. Most of the dialogue (if you can call it that) wasn't spoken aloud, but rather were thoughts of the two main characters. It would be one thing if they were having profound and interesting thoughts...but they weren't. Collin Farrell constantly thinking, ""I love her. I made her love me. I want to love her in the wilderness."" And then Pocahontas', ""Come back to me. Mother guide me."" Blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH! The lines that were ""thought"" and the things that were coming out of their mouths were just completely ridiculous. Even the battle scenes were lacking.After about an hour and a half, my friend and I actually got up and left. I don't think the movie was even half way done - Christian Bale hadn't even made an appearance yet. On our way back, we joked that the movie wasn't even worth the subway ride it took us to get to the theatre...and that if we were Christian Bale or Collin Farrell, we would be completely embarrassed to be a part of it. Honestly, sitting in the theatre I felt embarrassed for them. That uncomfortable, squirm in your seat, ""Aww, why are you doing this? You're better than this!"" feeling. Do you think that while people are filming a movie there is ever a point when they look at each other and just say, ""Wow...this is complete and total crap?"" I have a feeling The New World may have had one of these moments.If you REALLY want to see this movie, go ahead and pay to see it in the theatre... but for those who are just mildly interested, wait until they show it on TV.

I feel I didn't really know her name until she was called Rachel. Also who does she marry? The credits told us, but again don't recall her husband being called by name. Lastly, where was this movie filmed? What Indian tribe were these people from? What historians and/or native Americans fact checked details in the movie?

Today, Jan 20th, I saw the movie and i was really upset. I love long movie (like King Kong, i love that one.) but The New World... i don't know, it just a pretty long and boring show of the story. The main idea of the story still works just fine but I don't really see a good pictures, but that is from my own perspective. I still encourage our friends to go and see the way the producer makes this movie (make up was OK IF there are some interesting actions were in the movie...). And, i know the soundtrack didn't work that good, it was really annoying at some parts of the movie. It was playing for too long and too loud, it just didn't fit well in the movie.

Every school in the nation should be required to show this to history students.

Really, so brutally, mind-numbingly boring. I think I was in the theatre for 4 or 5 hours, at least if felt like it. Like many others, I should have walked, but I kept thinking...no it can't be this bad...it has to pick up. It didn't. There were a couple of things that COULD have redeemed this movie. First, the lead girl. She was pretty Hot. That being said...didn't see enough skin. that would have at least kept the male audience entertained. a couple times the director teases you and makes you think your gonna sneak a peak...but like everything else about this movie...it leaves you disappointed. Secondly, Battle scenes. there was one, it sucked. how you can shoot people, club them with mallets, and spear them, and not get any blood on you...i'm not sure.Actually there was one good thing about this movie. The indians bring the British bastards some meat in the winter time...they managed to bring in a real nice buck. and a big 'ol turkey. that was neat.The music was I think one 45 second clip, and every time music was cued up it was the Same thing. and it wasn't even good.The cinematography was good sure, but even that got old about 10 minutes in.Bottom line: Crap Movie",The New World

I remembered sitting in the theater looking at my watch every 10 minutes wondering when will this torture end. If you liked The Thin Red Line you will love this movie. Plenty of sun shining through trees, plenty of mindless walking around. Natives walking through the fields, colonists walking through the fields, natives walking through the forest, then colonists walking through the forest, voice overs here and there, natives running around , colonists walking again, natives walking again, a battle where many colonists die and yet their numbers don't diminish, more walking, more voice overs, a boat ride, more walking, a conversation, more walking, more sunlight, oh beautiful nature, more walking...get the idea.

649,stottlem,The New World is a flop!,1,21 January 2006,"Hi Everyone, I must first tell you that I am in no way a movie critic. I just felt an obligation to inform everyone about the truth about this movie. I went to see this movie last night with my fiancé. The movie started out with promise. You were introduced to beautiful scenes of what is supposed to be 17th century Virginia. The only flaw I found here was that the music was irritating. It was a very loud group of strings which were pulsating for minutes on the same two tones. I was very excited when the cast appeared and the story began. The first 20 minutes had plenty of conversations between the characters. But after that the movie went down hill. When we are introduced to Pocahontas the story was believable. The only problem is that she never really talks. You hear a narrator in her voice (as if you were hearing her thoughts) but her entire lines to the other cast, John Smith included, could have been placed on one page of the script. The story has no real fight scenes or action of any sort. My fiancé wanted to leave one hour in but I made her stay in hopes that this movie was just waiting for some climax.First I must say I do not mind chick flicks. If there is humor, love, action or sports I am all for it, but this move lacked all of the above. All Pocahuntas kept asking herself is, ""Who am I......Who am I."" She falls in love, but never talks to him...he leaves...she falls in love again, never talks to him (maybe has a kid, I couldn't really tell), maybe wants to leave him.....and so on. I am not lying when I tell you that the FEMALES IN THE THEATRE WERE SLEEPIN! All their dates were waking them up. When the movie was over you could hear one man say, ""think God"" from the back of the theater and a lady in front of me say, ""That was the worst movie of history!"" Just please save your money and go see Harry Potter again or something. Maybe rent this movie but I wouldn't even do that. You can go and see this if you want but all I can figure by the rating is that people went and say this movie and were so bored that they decided to come home and vote that the movie was good.

650,WantsGoodMovies,Terrible Waste of Time,1,21 January 2006,"My wife and I love movies. It is not unusual for us to see two per week in the theater. In this year of so many disappointing movies, we were anxiously awaiting The New World, which appeared to have much promise from its previews. Unfortunately, The New World proved not only disappointing, but downright terrible!Someone needs to tell director Terrence Malick that beautiful photography alone does not make a movie! People were actually walking out half-way through this empty, insubstantial picture, which was more of a boring slide-show than a feature film! There was so little script that viewers had no way of knowing who any of the characters were, and there were only haphazard indications of the passage of time. Tragically, this effort fails completely as a historical piece, and you will learn more about the story by reading the film's synopsis than by seeing the over-wrought film itself.Worse, to call this disjointed slide-show a ""movie"" borders on false advertising, and New Line Cinema has done a dreadful dis-service to movie-lovers by releasing this tripe. I would not be surprised if some slick lawyer decides to file a class-action lawsuit on the part of the misled audience. This slide-show of a film was tedious, vague, ill-conceived, ill-executed, horribly directed and just boring! I will never again waste money on any film that Terrence Malick directs! Never!Die-hard movie fans to the end, my wife and I stuck it out to the very last frame, and we regretted doing so. As we left the theater, all we heard from the other exiting audience members were criticism after criticism. And many were not as kind as this review! Rarely has a gathering of such talented actors, production designers and photographers been so ill-served by a flimsy script, terrible directing and inane editing. Not to mention a music score that was so inappropriate at times that it elicited laughs from the audience during tragic scenes.The only consolation is that word-of-mouth will surely get this picture out of theaters very quickly.",The New World
651,schwartztacular,It Stinks!,1,21 January 2006,"The trailer didn't impress me much, so I was expecting the movie to be mediocre, but I must say I was quite surprised; The New World is the worst movie I've seen on the big screen in a long time. And most of the other terrible movies I've seen were at least bad enough to be funny. This one is just awful. The running time is 150 minutes, not really long by today's standards, yet it feels infinitely longer. If you asked me to describe the movie in one word, I would probably have to use ""boring,"" but that really only begins to describe it. If you don't write too large, you could fit all the dialogue (including the intensely dull internal monologues) from the whole movie onto one 4x6"" note card, and the vast amount of parts when nobody speaks are also strangely devoid of music or sound effects. Last night was the first time ever that I could actually hear the film projector running. The movie is also full of so many jump-cuts that they have to have been put there deliberately, yet they have no purpose at all and are only jarring, and only further remind you that you're watching a crappy movie. The cast has a lot of really great actors, talent that is completely wasted on this movie. Jonathan Pryce, for example, is an exceptional actor, yet his role in The New World comprised sitting still, standing up, and clapping like an excited six-year-old. Sadly, this is not an isolated case in The New World. The worst part is that it is completely pointless. Throughout the entire move almost nothing happens. I really can't stress enough how lousy this movie is. Ironically, the popcorn I got was really good, but I didn't finish it. The movie was so bad, yet I sat through the whole thing.",The New World

The voice over narratives are annoying and you just want to hit the stop button, but all else is silent except for the cheesy porn sounding music that pipes in periodically when Pochahanta and Jon Smith are in touching scenes together. This film tries to be poignant and artsy, but falls way short. Christian Bale is the only believable character in the film and unfortunately he is only in it for the last 20 minutes. I suppose the lack of dialog could be defended by saying that they spoke 2 different languages, but Pochahantas sure learned fast.

Don't bring anything that would assist you in hurting yourself.I got the impression that they must have trimmed this from over four hours of film. (The movie runs for a grueling 2 hours 30 minutes. The story was so dis-jointed. The movie does not communicate very well at all. The movie moves so slowly it is unbearable. Some people got up and left the theater, the rest of us hung in hoping that it would get better. There were a couple of good scenes, disjointed as they were. The director must have been asleep when they put the scenes together. I don't believe I paid $8 to see this.

It's 2 1/2 hours of nothing happening followed by 3 minutes of some random crap and naked indians running out of doorways in england.The only good part of the film was the Pocahantas not wearing any underwear while frolicking in the fields. The girl herself is a butterface, although she has an gorgeous smile.Honestly, you can read through the book version in 10 minutes, there are maybe 40 words in the entire film. Followed by five minute montages of water flowing, Indian girl frolicking, doing some ritual, Colin Ferrel disappears, babies pop out of nowhere. Years go by without you knowing because nobody ages. Batman appears out of the blue, Pocahontas becomes psychic to find out Colin isn't dead.The whole movie seemed like a really expensive and badly made student film. at least random shots of a drunk woman, face licking, and sad clowns flipping pancakes is more entertaining then this piece of human excrement.",The New World
656,ceo1944,A second look at the New World,10,24 January 2006,"Okay, I've just come back from a second viewing of The New World. The first time I saw it, I was stunned. The movie slowly wove a spell over me that I can't explain but that was more powerful in it's effect than any I can remember. I've been around for 52 years, and this just might be the single best film I've ever seen.I wanted to go back today and see if this impact was just something in the theater I accidentally inhaled. But even more, I wanted to try and resist getting swept up so as to see how the magic was woven and where it came from. I've read dozens of negative reviews of this movie, some of them vitriolic. Some people have watched the exact same thing as I have and consider it the worst they've ever seen or heard. It's long, boring, pointless, pretentious, poorly written, a mess. I really wanted to try and see it from that vantage. Do they have a point?I tried. I really did. But somewhere along the line, I think maybe when the Naturals show up out of the misty snow with their gifts of food and life, I got caught up again and lost my objectivity. By the end, when Rebecca does those cartwheels on the dam of that little pond, my eyes were rimmed with tears again. I don't like to cry at movies. I rarely, rarely do. I don't like movies that make me cry. I guess this is an exception. And the miraculous thing is, I can't even identify the emotion that wells up inside me. Sadness? Joy? I don't know. It's a mixture of things. But it's powerful, powerful.One thing I want to put to rest right now. Many critics who don't like this film say it's sloppily constructed, with lots of pointless nature shots designed to take up screen time for no reason other than to look pretty and thereby be pretentious. Many, even those who like it, seem to think the narrative is weak and unnecessary. I paid close attention to those criticisms as I watched. And I don't believe there's a single frame or a single word in this movie that isn't there for a purpose. On my second viewing, I could see more clearly some of the symbolism of light and darkness and many other things. The words spoken ""privately"" by the characters are not teen-diary level filler material as some have charged...every statement has a point to it and some is profoundly moving. However, I will say that it took two viewings to understand some of the dialog. I can't explain why it's not spoken more clearly.I still don't know exactly the source of the magic, but I'm sure it lies in the combination of the stunning visuals and the unbelievable music, and the superb acting done by everyone without exception. I didn't realize the first time, but I do now, what a crucial role both sound and music play in this film. They are perfectly synchronized to the pictures. It's simply never been done better.The ending of this thing is sublime. I knew what was going to happen, and how it was going to happen, in every detail and it still hit me like a runaway train and left me sitting there, through the credits, not even wanting to move. There were eleven other people in the theater with me (This was an early matinée), and one left after the last fade to black. All the others sat there, except for the few that came down to the front and just stood there, staring at the credits.It's simply extraordinary, and I feel a sadness for those who can't or won't put forth the effort it takes to open themselves up a little bit, slow down, and drink in this magical potion.",The New World
657,cybuster_2002,Dissenter,2,24 January 2006,"First off, I know I'm going to get lambasted for this rating. Let me start by saying that the acting, cinematography and production values were all top notch. But frankly, the movie flowed like one of my high school history papers. 15 pages of flowery garbage that could have been done succinctly in about one paragraph to half a page. The wind blowing, the scenery, they were both beautifully done. But seriously, do we need to watch still water and rain drops falling on a pond for an hour? Just how interesting is tree bark? How much thought have you given to the enthralling qualities of grass growing? The silence may have been revolutionary and ""artsy,"" but frankly it just added to the complete and utter boredom that was apparent in everyone, save the elderly who were already asleep, in the theater. And better yet, when the characters DID speak, they mumbled inaudible noises disguised as the English language.It literally pained me to watch this movie. I reached a point where I questioned my existence and why I was still in the theater, when clearly I could have been studying, working out, cleaning, doing ANYTHING productive. There were 3 separate occasions where I believed (and was truly grateful) that the movie was over...unfortunately, I was wrong. Dead wrong. the sole reason for keeping me in that seat was the fact that I had already invested $8. It was the principle of it. Once again, I'm sure that this movie will win a large number of awards, and it deserves to win some of them. There are two things I look for in a movie: 1. Entertainment value, 2. Epiphanies. As far as entertainment value, this movie gets a large THUMB DOWN. This was undoubtedly one of the most boring pieces of ""art"" that I have ever witnessed. As for epiphanies, no. This movie has not changed my life, or philosophy in life at all. Nor has it given me any new perspectives on concepts I already thought about. All this movie did for me was waste my $8.Even though it's only about 2.5 hours, my mind felt like it was 10. I feel as though I lost more brain cells watching this movie than I would have had I sat about 1 in from a nuclear reactor going critical. This movie may be appealing to some who have a vastly different set of priorities than I (and the vast majority of the viewing public), but overall, I wouldn't even use this movie to hold up an uneven coffee table. Although it might be useful for a skeet shooting outing...",The New World
658,dgill59936,New World,1,24 January 2006,"Historically this movie is a farce. The inaccuracies are so many and blatant that I find myself stunned in disbelief. No one in this movie thought of reading a history book on the settlement of Jamestown. Pocahontas and Smith never had a love affair. She was a 12 or 13 year old beautiful girl fascinated and infatuated with the John Smith and English settlers. It is a myth that Smith had a relationship with Pocahontas. Even the last scene of Rolfe, who Pocahontas did marry, carrying his child on board to head for the New World was wrong. Rolfe abandon the child in England never seeing him again. Now it not bad enough the movie is historically inaccurate but after 15 minutes of beautiful cinematography the show turns into a BORE. No plot, no action, no nothing I am reminded of 1968 Elvira Madigan which was all beauty no substance. I can go to an art gallery if all I am looking for is beautiful art works. I need more than that from films.",The New World

How does a director graduate from film school having learned only the close up shot? And what excuse can there be for a movie score with only one musical note? Its like listening to the test pattern noise on the TV when you wake up at 4AM on the couch. Even the perpetually grey weather is boring in this film. I haven't checked my watch that much since New Year's Eve. If you need to be rendered comatose for some surgical procedure, then this film is for you. Never have I posted a comment on a movie before. However, in this example it is plain and simply a civic duty since this film risks creating large squads of somnambulistic zombies who might attempt to drive home, wide-eyed but oblivious, from their local theaters. Of course, nature lovers will perhaps be interested in the many long views of trees, grass and water but staring at your wallpaper will be both cheaper and more fun.",The New World
660,rickahight,Was not impressed,2,27 January 2006,"Just wasn't my kind of movie. Really was mislead in the trailers and advertising. I just wish Hollywood would tell the truth instead of finding out most of the movie was background thoughts. Those that like that kind of movie can make their decision.There were a few decent scenes but for the most part told the story in the background talking, not dialog. Too many scenes went on for far too long with nothing said.At the end of the movie, most of the entire theater stayed seated and after a moment you could hear boos, ""what was that"", laughing and general talking of dissatisfaction.I think movies like this and Brokeback Mountain should be advertised for what they are. The New World was advertised more as a 1600 explorer and Indian action movie instead of the artistic thin red line movie that it was. Brokeback mountain was advertised as a romantic movie with the men and women in the trailers and not as the gay cowboy movie it really was. It is intentionally deceiving the paying public.A definite thumbs down.",The New World
661,tiffany-enos,"Beautiful, Powerful, Unexpected",10,28 January 2006,"I saw it last Tuesday night, after a hectic, long and stressful day where all I hoped for was some mindless entertainment. It was not a movie I would have chosen, but a couple of friends suggested it. What it turned out to be was totally unexpected.It has Colin Farrell, Christian Bale, and a girl named Q'Orianka Kilcher who was only 14 when this movie is made and totally blows me away with her depth and grace. The story is another telling of Pocahontas and John Smith, with a new character (historically accurate, I think), John Rolfe (Christian Bale). What is so surprising about this movie - over 2 hours long - is that there is more dialog in a half-hour sitcom than in this movie. But I came away from it more moved and touched - not in a darling, maternal way but in a truly changed, effected way - than I have from any movie that I can think of. Farrell, Bale, and this incredible girl were so utterly convincing in their facial expressions, gestures, and other silent communications - in addition to some dialog and voice-overs, of course, it's not a silent film :o) - that I was deeply drawn in and find that it still is affecting me today. I'd want you to know going into it that it is far from a conventional film so if you're like me you might squirm through the first while as your expectations get shifted.

Not only will I not get that 2 1/2 hours back, but I spent twelve dollars when I could have easily bought myself a fifth of vodka instead. I would recommend being trashed to enjoy the movie. If you do go and see this movie, I guarantee that you will walk out within the first half hour. I think the only exciting part of going to the movie was seeing the trailer for the DaVinci code. That was the highlight of the whole night. Another point to include was that there was hardly any dialog and Mozart was being played when Mozart didn't even exist in that time frame.

During its playing I saw some people walking out of the theater and the rest, including me just shifting in the seats, waiting for an end.

666,naiamoon,A New World Meditation,10,30 January 2006,"Amazing film. In order to fully comprehend the prison we call ""America"" and ""civilization"" I suggest to you that you go see this film in this manner. When you enter the theater instead of sitting silently or chatting with your friends take a look around at your fellow movie goers, try and make eye contact, smile...if this seems strange or uncomfortable meditate on the alienation of sitting separately and uncommunicative with your fellow human in a public place. Once you have had your look about then sit silently with you eyes close and relax . When the previews start keep your eyes closed and as you listen think about how the words devoid of the associative imagery are easily identified as mental programming instructions for the maintenance of our ""so-called-reality."" Do not open your eyes until you hear prayer to the sun spoken by Pocahontas at the beginning of the film. I assure you that if you approach the film in this way you will never think the same about the world you find outside the multiplex and will achingly mourn the loss of the land as it was and the people who once lived upon it. Terence Malik, the director tells a story with imagery rather than narrative and there is more to it than Jamestown, John Smith or Pocahontas. At the conclusion you realize that this film is a meditation upon Love as our natural state of being and how this Love is thwarted by a person seeking ambition, by a civilization that has long ago forgotten Love and seeks material wealth as a poor substitute and by the antagonism that exists in patriarchal cultures, whether ""natural"" or ""civilized.""",The New World

I paid good money to watch this film, which had the potential to be excellent. Unfortunately, it was reminiscent more of a seventies B movie, than a classy piece of film making. Take an Indian squaw, who spent the whole film wandering around and sighing ""Who am I"", and musing the deep thoughts one only reads in arty books, rather than worrying about where her next meal was coming from and a film hero who was next to useless, so bad, I wanted to kill him myself, an absolutely awful set of lines for the cast..........need I say more.We left the cinema an hour before the end, and were by far the first to do so. About half the audience had left before us and the only two left on our row were asleep.I had heard all the critics ranting and raving about this film, well, I have utterly lost faith in them and can only assume they were paid to praise the film, perhaps it would have been better had they been paid for their honesty.",The New World
669,jasmlede,Most peaceful movie I have seen,5,20 September 2018,I watched this movie for my history through film class it's probably boring for people who prefer action movies and things like that. I wouldn't recommend this movie just because I dont know anyone who would wanna see sit through this whole movie there really isn't cliff hangers or anything exciting. The plot of the movie is john smith making peace with Pocahontas tribe so that they'll trade with his men so they could survive and establish a successful colony. While doing so john falls in-love with with the native girl because she saved him from her tribe . John was also teaching Pocahontas English and helping her people to become what he called ''civilized''. Pocahontas dad was the protagonist because he didnt allow john and Pocahontas to happen or be together. You could tell this happened in a different time period because of the cloths they are wearing and the style they are wearing for instance john smith was wearing things you would see in a history book. You could also tell it was a different time period because they were using ships to travel and it was taking them years to get from one place to another. Another thing I noticed was that none people in Pocahontas's spoke English and usually modern day tribes they know how to at least speak some or know the English language. I also noticed that the English men spoke to good of English that it sounded like today's English and not the one back then with the accent. Something else that made me question the historical accuracy was that apparently there is no actual proof that john smith and Pocahontas were involved with each other. So how did they deiced on the scenes they had them together with? How do we actually know what happened. I feel like this is the adult version of the Disney movie they made about this. This is just a little bit more historically accurate and less childish. I liked the setting that they were at it was very very peaceful and pretty. The sounds in it were almost realistic like your there too. I liked that the movie is really well filmed and the pictures and scenes are astonishing. One thing I didn't like about this movie was that it was really boring and dull it had no climax it was a simple story with boring voices. It felt like they were doing everyday things that weren't fun or exciting. I feel like the film and sounds and the pictures saved the movie if it wasn't for the film it would have been a bad movie. The actors were really good I would like to see another movie with the girl who played Pocahontas sadly she hasn't starred in anything else. john smith seems like he might do well in a super hero movie or something like that. Over all I think you should watch it if you enjoy watching things like discovery channel or the history channel even documentaries. I liked it although there was no climax I enjoyed seeing and learning about the things they lived and did in that period of time. It's a very informational movie.,The New World

Most films nowadays could be seen as haiku, to put it crudely: they are short, to the point and appeal to those with short attention spans. The New World is not a film like that. It takes it's time and meanders along. Its a very long love poem and beautifully photographed and masterfully scored. Like a nineteenth century novel, it takes a bit of work to get through it, but the pay-off is worth it.All I can say is that if you liked Badlands or if you liked The Thin Red Line, you'll probably like The New World.

I must admit that at first I was glad of the opportunity to witness what promised to be an exciting treatment of a largely unexplored cinematic and historiographical topic, but I must confess my severe disappointment. Malick's direction at first seems enticing, different and refreshing. However, after two hours of consistent repetition of the same directing techniques it begins to become a little wearisome. The film doesn't really seem to know what it is. To me it appears as a standard love story, but it keeps trying to be something more, which naturally results in a confusing and disjointed picture. Hence, it becomes across a film which is devoid of substance and movement. It struck me at the end that nothing really happens. Like 'Alexander', this film just seemed to serve as another excuse for Colin Farrell to appear moody and dejected on camera; a thoroughly dissatisfying experience.",The New World

Oh yes I know there is the point that Europe messed up the perfect garden of the Americas, but that story is just a replay of the same thing happening throughout time and space.

Sadly, he hasn't been able to do the same here : his Indians are man children, Pocahantas spends most of her time chasing butterflies and praying, and the movie suffers from a simplistic approach of the matter. In the end, Terrence Malick does not deliver the same smart, unusual, emotional work of art as he did with ""The thin red line"".

687,haplo1998,Painfully awful,1,13 August 2006,"I had high expectation for this film as I am generally a fan of historical films and costume dramas. I found the pace of the film ridiculously slow with little or no dialogue or narration to point out what the hell was going on. Incredibly beautiful nature scenes depicting an 'unspoiled' North American paradise with little or no human action go on for long, uninterrupted spaces of time. Dialog, or what passes for it in this movie, consists of long-sequences of character narration that describes what is going on and what they feel about it. This is appropriate in a novel, but in a movie extensive use of narration is more a crutch signaling a weak script, poor direction, or mediocre acting -- often all three.The acting in this film was also rather weak, principally because the characters seemed so lost in off screen narration that their on-screen performance seem mechanical and unnatural. Colin Farrell and Q'orianka Kilcher had absolutely no on-screen chemistry.In short, this is a film that glorifies and emphasizes the natural world the characters find themselves rather than what the characters are saying or doing to each other.",The New World
688,sveneick,Film as Art,10,27 February 2006,"Terrence Malick produces art. It is important to understand this when considering watching one of his movies. If you're looking for a night out eating popcorn, slugging down a coke and giving your brain a break give his films a skip. If you want to challenge the way you perceive reality, open your heart and gain appreciation for the beauty of life, don't look anywhere else.The New World is not a love story, any more than it is a historical epic. Rather the film is a slow, profound meditation on innocence, the balance of nature and that odd disturbance of equilibrium that is so characteristic of Western civilization. The acting in Malick's films is absolutely superb, and he brings out evocative and sincere performances from all his actors. I have heard comments that this film is merely a complaint, but I think this reveals a basic ignorance of the fact that Malick allows viewers to reach their own understanding and insights from his images, and his scripts are free of polemic or propaganda of any sort.Another common complaint against Malick is the length of his films. This once again betrays a fundamental lack of insight into his work. Malick's films play out slowly precisely so one can tune into the deep current of emotion and beauty in his work. The length of the films appears to me to be a subtle indictment of the haste, superficiality and mindless stimulation of modernity. People who think otherwise are welcome to challenge themselves with a 50 Cent music video on MTV.There is no point in comparing this film to other releases this year. It stands alone, an expression of integrity, passion and the peaks of cinematic endeavour. If you like it, check out the Thin Red Line and Days of Heaven.",The New World
689,valentinceline,Utter rubbish,1,4 March 2006,"This movie is not only slow and boring, it does not stick to historical fact. While the settlement of Jamestown looks the part, the civility and heroism of its inhabitants overestimates their moral worth. Furthermore, although the myth of the good savage is central to this movie (particularly through the Pocahontas character), the Western violence of the colonialism that comes with it is glossed over. The tragedy of the real Pocahontas is only hinted at.Terrence Malick proves once more how good he is at making pseudo-philosophical movies that make you yawn. He once more uses the long and slow pans of waving grass and the same annoying voice over as in The Thin Red Line.",The New World
690,sahanem_1,Amazing way of expressing the creation of the so called 'New World' and 'new World Order',10,7 March 2006,"Those who expected to watch a typical American movie may have been disappointed. This was not a film of showing history from only a war point of view such as pure fighting and war scenes.The film has a very smooth flow and expressed the views in a rather intellectual way. people must take a close look at the personalities of the two main characters in the film.i would have to say that its one of the most impressive love movies made as well. The acting is breathtaking, especially of the indigenous girl. They managed to reflect the feelings and the way of living at the time very well. Also the main character of the 'New World' in comparison to the Red Indian also tries in an indirect way to show the differences between the systems, way of thinking and societies. There is no doubt that Red Indians must have liked the film more than the new owners of the USA as well as people who were expecting a typical American movie. I suppose this was the only non-typical American movie having the word' America' in its name.",The New World
691,philipvanderkwast,"The new world, Boring movie",2,29 March 2006,"I was really looking forward to watch this movie, but when i did, i got so bored, watched it in double or four speed.. A dialog of four sentences takes like forever. Nice camera shots, but why put the whole movie full of it? This movie could have been finished in a normal 90 min time, in my opinion. My wife is still watching, while i went back to the computer to save some people to spend time om this movie.It is not the length that boors me and also i am not looking for action. One of my favorite movies is Scent of a Woman which is also a rather slow and longer movie, but this one... really bored me to the point where i left it. I don't understand the high ranking of the film on IMDb.",The New World
692,radiant80,"This movie is artistic, experimental, self-indulgent, and just plain boring.",1,18 March 2006,"A friend directed me to this place and I read some of the comments. I joined up JUST to post on this thread. I'll start out by saying that ""good"" or ""bad"" are subjective concepts, so instead of talking about ""how much this movie sucked"", I'll talk about ""why I did not like the movie.""First I'll start out by addressing some comments posted by other users:This movie is NOT, as someone said, a movie about the native people. Smoke Signals is a movie about native people. It depicts them in modern-day context. It is a beautiful, artistic movie that is not boring. Dreamkeeper is quite possibly the best movie about natives I have ever seen. It depicts their struggles against society, identity crisis, alcohol addiction, and adds their myths in a ""Hercules-Kevin Sorbo"" style of cinema. The changes from myth to reality are almost poetic, and by the end you almost want to cry, as the movie touches some kind of internal 'feeling'. The New World, on the other hand, has a horrible portrayal of natives. The chief looked distinctly Blackfeet, while the rest of the tribes looked Mohican, Navajo, and Cherokee (based on their haircuts, body-paint, and the way they wear their feathers.) Some of them looked like a made up concept from a mad-max movie. ""Pocahontas"", who is never called Pocahontas, looks distinctly Taino (which is not even a continental U.S. tribe). For some odd reason, this promiscuous breed of native deals in skins, which is something that the Plains Indians were most noticeable for.Someone else said that the movie is excellent because it depicts the true love between Pocahontas and John Smith. I should mention that the historic community (meaning historians and history professors) are torn in this regard. Many say that Pocahontas was indeed in love, while others state that Pocahontas (age 14 at the time) was raped by John Smith (46), and because of the tribe's beliefs and social construct, she decided to stick with him for better or worse. I'll admit that I know very little of the tribes from the North East, but I know that in many tribes if a woman is raped and the rapist is known, he has to take care of the woman or be killed/exiled.As for the movie itself, people say it's artistic, maybe poetic, experimental, and new. They say that because of these things, it is a masterpiece. I would like to say that because something is new/experimental/poetic/artistic does not mean it's necessarily good. For those who know of poetry, this movie is the movie industry's ""Michael Wigglesworths' Day of Doom"". Half the movie is ""stare"" scenes. Two or more people stand ""there"" staring at each other silently, emoting, as the camera moves around a bit and makes rough cuts. 1/4th of the movie are nature scenes. Grass grows. A tree. Water. An eagle. More grass. Birds flocking. The same eagle. Sunset. The same eagle. The other 1/4th of the movie were scenes that made no sense whatsoever. Example: While in England, one of the natives (historically he was a king of one of the five north-eastern tribes, but this is changed in the movie)is looking around stunned in a large courtyard. This is not unrelated, as it shows natives being amazed at what other cultures have constructed. However, about 10 stare scenes and 3 eagles afterward, he is shown sitting down on a bench. He stands up and starts running. Another pointless scene is John Smith somewhere in the north. He's there, looking sad, and that's it. Another pointless scene is a whole hour of John and Pocahontas staring at each other or watching the grass grow and not saying a single word to each other.The musical score was nice, but horrible at the same time. They used the same sad piano song throughout the whole movie. As for the 30 second war scene, the same native is shot 3 times. This is the same native that goes to England afterward. As for the ending.... After Pocahontas.... um... Rebecca dies, her spirit dances around in the courtyard for 2 minutes. Then Rolfe and baby Rolfahontas board a boat. The boat sets sail. An empty harbor. The sky. Birds fly. The ship sailing. A river. The same eagle. Birds fly. Sunset. Empty harbor. River. A tree. Grass. A tree. The river. A tree. A tree. A tree. A tree. 30 seconds of ""a tree"". Then uninspiring credits. This movie suffers all the flaws that the awesome movie ""Master and Commander"" suffers: it tries to be somewhat of a documentary, but it's not. It tries to be a good movie, but it's not. It's so slow, it never really starts. If you want a really poetic movie, try 13 or Piñero. Those are poetic dramas that are actually fun.Many people who pretend to be intellectual will tell me things like ""but you don't get it"", ""this is experimental cinema, it's for the true cinema lover"", ""who are you to criticize this movie?"", and ""it's poetry in motion"", and ""this movie is only for educated people, so a savage from a third world country such as yourself would not understand its beauty."" (People have already told me these things.) Well, I am someone who has a Masters degree in ESL education, 30 credits towards a masters degree in literature, 24 undergrad credits in Drama and Theater, and has taken several workshops on cinematography. My third world country has the highest living standard in all of Latin America (mostly thanks to U.S. funding, but nonetheless it's not a third world country.) I love cinema. This does not mean I have to love every self-indulgent movie that comes out.Terrence Malick owes me 3 hours of my life, and $5.50 for the movie ticket.",The New World
693,qepler,This movie is a total time waste.,1,18 March 2006,"This movie is one the most boredom films i've ever saw.. in fact, when I went to see it I left the cinema after about 30mins because I fell asleep out of boredom. Unless you're a person who gets all this touchy and emotional plus you have iron nerves and patience of steal, take my word on it, don't waste your money and time on this boredom. When I first saw the movie trailers and the kind of hype around it, I went to see it, but never thought it would be that bad. So from I think of this film is that its mostly a film for the review writers and competition such as Oscar etc'... This isn't the kind of movies you go to and when you leave the cinema you say ""wow."", this more of the movies you leave the cinema and say ""damn, did I just waste 2 hours of my time and 5 bucks of my money for this c***?!""

694,menda-mendoza,how green and noble was my America,8,19 March 2006,"if this a season for ""issues"" movies then this movie is certainly not out of place in the here and now; on the other hand the conflict among races and cultures as presented here, and also because of the historical setting, and not least because it's simply Pocahontas revisited, doesn't seem to strike much of a thematic chord in this film.i have to talk about this flick in terms of it's ""educational"" aspects -- these are significant, or, shall i say, SHOULD be significant to our complacent generations of today that need to understand the complex roots of many of the sociological problems the world faces today.but this is no dreary documentary bereft of cinematographic value. the verdant lushness and wintry glory of the ""marshlands"" are more than striking, they bring the viewer and the land face to face... there is original drama to be enjoyed as well, and for thinking people, anyway, plenty of entertainment.i can not overemphasize the display of relationships between nature and people, shown in a subdued, non-symbolic manner, but there are many other themes running through the film.among other things, it's a love story, to be sure; a boy-meets-girl movie... about chastity, monogamy, having children... a story about life and a death story, as well.yet the most outstanding feature of this film is the fortuitous choice of Q'orianka Kilcher as the leading lady. she looks broken, like the continent; she looks odd as an alien should; she is an earth creature at home in the mud; she looks unlikely to have the ability to dance gracefully at the royal ball -- but her elegance and raw, unexplainable beauty, her undulating femaleness mirroring the tall grasses and meandering streams, her personal presence to rival the tall trees of her native forests... lend this movie an unrivaled freshness and a welcome uniqueness. she may not be the etiquette equal of the English women, but she overwhelms the screen with her femininity and natural appeal.it's not the perfect movie, but go see it, anyway. it's worth it.",The New World
695,peter-clancy,"Pretentious , dull, directorially self-indulgent rubbish",1,24 March 2006,"Make no mistake about it, this movie is appalling.Yes, it has some haunting music, some beautiful scenery and one cannot fault the authenticity of recreating the period of history. The problem comes when you start looking around for a dialogue, a story, any excitement or any involvement in the proceedings.There is an awful lot of people wistfully staring at each other, a lot of trees blowing in the wind, rivers, birds, spiders and, well, wildlife. It seems as if the director is waiting for a story to come to him, and in the mean-time, look at that flock of birds.Another thing that strikes you, is the lack of a script. I think in the 2 1/2 excruciatingly boring hours of film, there must have been about 100 words said. Ethereal musings like ""Who is he?"" and ""Where did he come from?"" and pretensions like ""What is life, Mother?"" come drifting down from the screen. Meanwhile, from around the theatre I could hear moviegoers asking each other ""What the hells going on?"", ""What are those birds doing?"" and ""shall we go?"".I am sorry to the other reviewers who have rated this film so highly, as I can see what they are saying to some extent. The problem I have is that to make the points that this film is ramming down our throats - about the destruction of innocence and good-nature vs. evil-""civilisation"" - it does not need such a deadly passive storyline to do it.I cannot help feeling that the director was doing everything he possibly could to stop the film being labelled as an ""action"" movie. He dampens every potentially good action scene so that it doesn't get too exciting. Even the few battles there are, are short-lived 'hand-bag' affairs where no one seems to get hurt - It's like watching ""Pocahontas and the A-Team"".Unfortunately, in striking the balance between poignancy, style and story, he got it completely wrong. Movies like ""Last of the Mohicans"" have beautiful scenery, a love story, excellent action sequences, script and makes all the points this movie tries to in much less time.I fell asleep in this movie. Granted I was quite tired, but this movie pushed me over the edge. I fell asleep at the bit where the girl meets King James until she is walking in the garden having been reunited with Cap'n Smith. I cannot imagine anything interesting happened in the time I was out and I am pretty sure I will never find out as I will not be revisiting this disastrously overrated movie.",The New World
696,wyzmonki,"Visually stunning, historically inaccurate",4,25 March 2006,"While the scenery was stunning and the story was palatable enough my worst fears were confirmed - the writers and producers of this picture decided to put a romantic spin on Smith's relationship with Pocahontas. This aspect (as well as one or two others) are not true to history - Pocahontas was 12 years old when she met John Smith and they did not have a romantic relationship. I felt that this film was not that easy to digest until after John Smith had left for England - and not because of Colin Farrell's portrayal of him (which was excellent)but because once the farce of Smith and Pocahontas' relationship was out of the picture things became a whole lot more accurate and subsequently more enjoyable. This said, The New World is far more accurate than Disney's Pocahontas, although I enjoyed Disney's film more than this one.",The New World
697,DavidDeas,"""Paradise and Director/Writer Lost """,4,7 July 2006,"John Smith was not Irish so this first error , re-enforced constantly by Colin Farrell's miscasting together with his accent set the tone for this accurately set movie being spoiled by its inaccurate plotting of Smith , Rolfe and Pocahantas . Beautifully to look at , but at times its incoherence taken with the inaccuracies , made even this pale . This is so obviously a missed opportunity given the Director/Writer's talents . Maybe once again the creator was to close to his project and needed an experienced old head to guide his hand at the right time .
