0,MartinHafer,"Far from perfect, but worth seeing...",7,1 December 2014,"Have you ever watched a film that was pretty good but easily could have been better? Well, that's my reaction to What If, a new DVD release which stars Daniel Radcliffe (yes, THAT Daniel Radcliffe). It's a pretty decent little romance, but the film also sure looks like the script could have used a decent editing, as sometimes the dialog is needlessly offensive--with ample references to feces and the like. Additionally, while the two leads (Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan) are both very likable, some of the supporting characters are absolutely ridiculous, as no one talks or acts like some of these folks.The film is much like the premise behind When Harry Met Sally. In other words, it questions whether a man and woman can be just friends and stay that way. In this case, Wallace meets Chantry--a woman who is engaged and living with another man. They agree to only be friends, but as the film progresses, you see them spending more and more time together and they obviously have some chemistry. The film has lots of sweet and amusing moments between the leads-- and the clever script and nice acting work together well most of the film. But at other points, this chemistry is obscured by needless distractions--which I talked about above. All in all, however, the good does outweigh the bad and the film will be an interesting experience to folks who love Radcliffe--which these days seems to be practically everyone.",What If
1,SnoopyStyle,Good actors in cute formulaic rom-com,7,21 March 2015,Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) has been heart broken for a year since his relationship with Megan (Sarah Gadon). He's a med school dropout living with his sister Ellie (Jemima Rooper) in Toronto. He goes to his college roommate Allan (Adam Driver)'s party and falls for his cousin animator Chantry (Zoe Kazan). The big problem is that she already has a boyfriend. He throws her number away but they run into each other at the theater for 'The Princess Bride'. Nicole (Mackenzie Davis) moves in with Allan. Chantry invites Wallace for dinner and meets her boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall) and her recently broken up sister Dalia (Megan Park).Daniel Radcliffe is not the new Hugh Grant but he has a certain charm. Zoe Kazan has that indie charm and together they form a nice cinematic couple. The movie has nothing new to say but I don't see that as big of a problem as many critics. It's asking the same question as 'When Harry Met Sally...' There is enough cuteness and adorability in this formulaic rom-com. The actors are fine and there is good chemistry. Adam Driver from Girls is a tamer version of Adam and he works quite well. Mackenzie Davis is also fun. Director Michael Dowse does need to stop filming the CN tower. It gets annoying and the CN tower is not some fanciful icon either.,What If
2,kosmasp,What if ... there were actually good romantic comedies?,8,22 October 2014,"You might wanna overlook a few bumps along the road and rate them higher, because they are so rare. That's what if happens, as it does in this case. I think a 7 out of 10 would have been a more accurate rating, if there were more romantic comedies that would have at least some class and some sass and ... well something at all.As it is , What if is one of the better one, not only in recent years and shows a different side to the artist formerly known as Mr. Potter. He's actually pretty good in this, which can be attributed to the dialog and script in general. It's obvious where the movie leads and it almost seems unfair to some of the other characters. Some clichés will happen (they always do), but overall this is a very nice and decent affair (no pun intended)",What If
3,jboothmillard,What If,6,4 September 2014,"The now grown up star of Harry Potter proved himself as a serious actor in horror movie The Woman in Black, I was definitely looking forward to seeing if he could pull of a rom-com, from director Michael Dowse (It's All Gone Pete Tong, Goon). Basically Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) has a miserable job, lives with his sister Ellie (Jemima Rooper) and nephew in her apartment, and he dropped out of medical school after discovering his girlfriend having an affair with an Anatomy teacher, so he has not been social or two years. He is forced by his friend Allan (Adam Driver) into going to a party, while playing with fridge magnets bearing single words and making phrases he is joined by Chantry (Zoe Kazan) and the two fall into conversation, at the same time Allan meets and flirts with Nicole (Mackenzie Davis), leaving the party Wallace walks Chantry home. Chantry mentions that she has a boyfriend, but she still gives Wallace her number, but he decides not to attempt to pursue her, but he changes his mind when they see each other again outside a movie theatre, they had both gone alone, they then have dinner together, as time goes by they become good friends. Chantry invites Wallace to meet her longtime boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall, Timothy's son), who works for United Nations, things go wrong however when Ben ends up in hospital after Wallace accidentally pushes him out of the window, and at the hospital Wallace is confronted with his ex-girlfriend he dumped following the affair. While recovering Ben has to move to Dublin, Ireland for job requirements for six months, during time Wallace and Chantry start to each other more often and their relationship develop, they begin to have deeper feelings for each other, Wallace even stops Chantry's sister Dalia (Megan Park) coming onto him, she is turn talks negatively about him to her sister. Allan and Nicole, who have expressed high desire and sexual hunger for each other, often in front of Wallace, get married, with Wallace as best man, and invite him and Chantry for walk on the beach at night, they go skinny dipping, with Wallace and Chantry eventually joining in, and looking at each other naked, then they discover the other two have taken their clothes, they do not give into this forced intimate situation and simply share the sleeping bag, the next morning their clothes are returned and they are angry. Chantry, who works as an animator, is given a onetime only chance at a promotion, but it will require her to go to Taiwan, but with the straining of her relationship with Ben she travels to Dublin to join him, she discovers he has accepted more work commitments, meaning more travelling, and meanwhile Wallace decides he should reveal how he really feels about Chantry and follows her to Dublin. Chantry and Ben have already broken off their relationship, and upon arrival Wallace is punched in the face by Ben and falls down the stairs, on the floor Wallace checks his messages and learns that Chantry is now in Toronto, eventually he finds her, they have a conversation where she explains the break up and he explains why he came looking for her, but when he reveals his feelings she reacts badly. Returning to New York, Wallace considers returning to medical school and moving on with his life, but Chantry has apparently accepted the job and is having a leaving party, he attends and they have a tearful goodbye, they both finally reveal their feelings to each other, and are surprised to both give each other the same farewell gift, a Fool's Gold Sandwich (a hollowed out loaf of bread filled with a whole jar of peanut butter, a whole jar of jelly and a pound of bacon, famously eaten by Elvis Presley), which they previously talked about. In the end Wallace and Chantry finally share a kiss, through the credits it is revealed that they do start a relationship and move to Taiwan together, Wallace completes his training at medical school there and Chantry continues her work as an animator, and returning to Toronto they are married. Also starring Rebecca Northan as Holly, Oona Chaplin, Charlie's granddaughter as Julianne, Lucius Hoyos as Felix, Meghan Heffern as Tabby and Tommie-Amber Pirie as Gretchen. Radcliffe certainly does well as the Hugh Grant like young man who portrays British awkwardness and is very likable, Kazan is terrific as the slightly kooky and beautiful girl he is held back from expressing feelings to, I agree with critics that their chemistry is perhaps best when not flirting, but they are a good duo as they slowly fall in love, and Spall gets his moments as the annoying boyfriend getting in their way. It is agreeable that this format, friends to love interests, has been done numerous, but you are still drawn into the story that flows nicely with a pretty crafted script, there is the necessary mushiness, but there are also plenty of sequences that will make you laugh a lot too, a surprisingly pleasant and enjoyable romantic comedy. Good!",What If
4,studioAT,What if this film was just a tiny bit better?,5,8 July 2015,"After popping up in 'Horns' and 'The Woman In Black' Daniel Radcliffe opts for more lighter fare in this indie and quirky romantic comedy.While the idea is nothing we've not seen before (can a man and a woman be just friends?)this film manages to put a new spin on the idea and include some good jokes in the process.A lot of the film's success comes down to the casting. Radcliffe is dry and funny in his role of Wallace, and i'm sure lots of people in the audience fell in love with Zoe Kazan throughout the film's run.Much like 500 Days of Summer this film isn't as quirky or as entertaining as it thinks it is though, and some of the supporting characters are just plain unlikable. It also contains more strong language and sex references than it really needs. I honestly believe that if they'd cut these two things back then the film would have been more of a commercial hit.For two very good performances from the leads though, this film is OK.",What If
5,writers_reign,What If Harry Met Sally In Toronto?,7,22 August 2014,"The best thing going for this film as far as I was concerned is that it has been released in the UK at the tail-end of the Formula Sequel season, the time when kids are off school for the summer and need a constant supply of mindless fodder so that the ordinary movie buff is starved of product - in my case it's a good four weeks since I've been able to check out a new title even at an art house let alone a Multiplex. That to one side this is as formulaic as the sequels filling the malls even as I write but it's mostly literate and well acted and easy to watch. Gadg's granddaughter Zoe Kazan is, superficially just another cookie cutter pretty face - or in this case a cookie cutie - but makes a half-decent fist of a predictable role. Daniel Radcliffe is still trying to find a part that will release him from his Harry Potter image and does his best with a one-dimensional part. A lot of the pleasure comes from the supporting players. If they'd released this film at any other time in the UK it would have passed unnoticed but the third week in August was right on the button.",What If
6,oscaralbert,Exploring Canada's quaint courting customs . . .,8,26 August 2014,". . . with direct implications for your next fast-food burger. You see, Harry Potter and his cartoonist partner are obsessed with Pooh. He tells her the minute they meet that Elvis contained 40 pounds (?!) of unprocessed Pooh in his body when he croaked on his Tennessee toilet. Not only is this a blatant swipe at American culture and cuisine, but it sullies the memory of a U.S. musical icon. (Who can see WHAT IF, and not always think forever afterward that Elvis' famous pelvic gyrations during performances were just an effort to loosen his stools for when he could rush backstage?) Furthermore, Potter's partner's cousin says that Canadians can eat their own Pooh once with no ill consequences, but if they scarf down the resulting movement they'll surely die from the doubled toxicity! Who but Canadians can think up such stuff?! Now you may believe that you can simply skip WHAT IF and remain free of the Canadian Pooh assault. In reality, that ostrich-like tactic would be dangerous, since Burger King just defected to Canada today. Analysts say this is to allow BK to dodge their fair share of taxes, but many observers will wonder if the real reason is to cram more E Coli (a.k.a., Pooh) into their burgers. Don't Pooh-Pooh this view, until you've listened to what they're saying in WHAT IF.",What If
7,neil-476,predictable but enjoyable thanks to sparky script and Kazan,7,29 August 2014,"Wallace meets Chantry and they hit it off. Chantry has been in a relationship for five years, but that's OK because men and women can be friends without romance being an issue, can't they? Not in the movies they can't! Despite amusing moments, this is not a romantic comedy, it is simply a romance, and it is a romance which runs along utterly predictable lines: there are no surprises in it whatsoever. It depends for its success on an entertaining script and the charm of its leads. Well, on the basis of only one previous film (Ruby Sparks) I am already predisposed towards approving of Zoe Kazan, and she proves to be equal to the demands placed on her here: you can understand Wallace falling for Chantry.And what of Daniel Radcliffe? I do not have a high opinion of Mr Radcliffe as a screen actor. He has a limited range based on his work to date, starting at ""amiable"" and progressing in a straight line to ""quite anxious"" with nothing beyond those limits and nothing out beyond the edges either. What If does nothing to change my assessment but, since the character of Wallace isn't required to be anything other than amiable, this doesn't really matter. The supporting cast is good, with Rafe Spall doing particularly well as Chantry's long-term boyfriend, a decent enough chap but played with a subtle absence of sympathy.I enjoyed this more than its individual elements would have led me to expect I would.",What If
8,morrison-dylan-fan,What's the worst that could happen.,6,1 November 2014,"After watching the excellent Horror title Horns,I decided to take a look at Daniel Radcliffe's IMDb page.Taking a look at his credits,I found out that along with appearing in a horror film,that Radcliffe had also recently starred in a Comedy,which led to me getting ready to find out what could have been.The plot:Persuaded to attend a party by his friend Allan, (after spending a whole year being a reclusive,thanks to discovering his girlfriend secretly dating his uni teacher) Wallace decides to pass the time by rearranging magnetic plastic letters on the fridge.Spotting Wallace playing around with the fridge magnets,Allan's cousin Chantry decides to join Wallace,and starts coming up with new words.Quickly becoming friends,Wallace takes Chantry back home later that night,where he discovers Chantry has a boyfriend.Deciding to stay as friends,Wallace soon meets Chantry's boyfriend,who is scheduled to move away for 6 months,due to work commitment's.As he gets increasingly close to Chantry,Wallace begins to wonder,that due to her boyfriend being miles away,if he should ask Chantry out on a date.View on the film:Replacing original cast members Casey Affleck and Mary Elizabeth Winstead,in order to give the title a ""young"" appearance, (despite Winstead actually being younger than the chosen actress) Daniel Radcliffe and the pretty Zoe Kazan both give charming performances.Whilst Elan Mastai's adaptation of T.J. Dawe and Michael Rinaldi's play Toothpaste and Cigars does slip into being overly twee,Radcliffe and Kazan both give their characters an excellent feeling of warmth,thanks to Radcliffe showing a real nervousness in his attraction to Kazan,whilst Kazan wraps Chantry in a delightful kooky naivety.Giving the movie an easy-going Rom-Com vibe with a smooth indie soundtrack,director Michael Dowse uses bright,natural colours to show the warmth developing between Chantry and Wallace.Dipping into the kooky side of the screenplay,Dowse brilliantly uses startling animation to show the bond growing between the couple,as Wallace looks to Chantry and wonders ""what if?"".",What If

10,anaconda-40658,Not That Word.,7,24 September 2015,"The F Word (2013): Dir: Michael Dowse / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Zoe Kazan, Megan Park, Adam Driver, Mackenzie Davis: Young adult romantic comedy about chances. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as Wallace, who spends much of his time babysitting his nephew while nursing his breakup. Zoe Kazan plays Chantry whom he meets at a house party. They strike up a friendship until he learns that she has a boyfriend. How the film toys with their friendship becomes irritatingly corny as everyone questions or cautions him with his intentions thus constantly talking about the plot. This becomes formula with an ending we can see coming within ten minutes into it. Thankfully director Michael Dowse, who previously made Goon, details the characters with a touch of humour. Radcliffe takes off his Harry Potter glasses and excels as a medical student making a connection with someone whom is deemed forbidden. Kazan is quirky playing a business woman whose job is offering a promotion and whose boyfriend is constantly travelling. Fine supporting work by Adam Driver as Allan, Chantry's cousin and Wallace's best friend. Mackenzie Davis plays Nicole whom Allan hooks up and eventually marries. Megan Park plays Chantry's sister, Dalia, who comes on to Wallace and quickly learns that he is into her sister. Needlessly corny and conventional in its toying with the friendship theme but the film works in terms of relationships that either are not good for us, and those that we encounter on the fly and take the what ifs in life and transform them into a grand opportunity at happiness.

In the long celebrated tradition of romantic movies, a man and a woman can't be good friends without also falling in love. The fact that they are both beautiful and funny and smart is just the side effect of it being a film.Even if it was that formulaic, I enjoyed the banter and the romantic tension and, after all, it was exactly what I expected from the whole thing, so I can't fault it. All the actors were good at it and the casting was almost perfect. Would I have preferred it a little bit more realistic and applicable to life as we know it? Definitely yes.

13,Hellmant,Just funny and moving enough.,7,20 August 2014,"'WHAT IF': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Romantic comedy flick about a medical school dropout who falls in love with his best friend, who already has a boyfriend. The film is also called 'THE F WORD' (everywhere except in the US and UK), and I'm assuming the 'F word' in this case is friend. It was directed by Michael Dowse; who's also directed other indie comedy flicks like 'GOON', 'TAKE ME HOME TONIGHT' and 'FUBAR'. It was written by Elan Mastai and based on the play 'Toothpaste and Cigars', by T.J. Dawe and Michael Rinaldi. The movie stars Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan, as it's two leads, and costars Adam Driver, Mackenzie Davis, Megan Park and Rafe Spall. I found it to be just funny and moving enough, to forget all it's clichés and unoriginality.Radcliffe plays Wallace and Kazan plays Chantry. Wallace recently dropped out of med school and is suffering from yet another bad breakup. Chantry is an animator he meets at a party. The two instantly hit it off but as Wallace is asking her for her phone number he finds out she has a longtime boyfriend, named Ben (Spall). The two become really good friends and end up spending a lot of time together, while Wallace continues to develop stronger and stronger feelings for her.I've definitely had a lot of crushes on a lot of girls with boyfriends, so this is definitely a film I can relate to. I can't especially relate to either Wallace or Chantry though and found some of the situations, they end up in, to be pretty annoying and unbelievable. It does kind of play out like a routine romantic comedy flick but it does have plenty of witty and clever dialogue (sometimes too much) and it's pretty emotional at times as well. I definitely don't think the movie is as cool or hip as it wants to be but it's still a better than average rom-com.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ZEmam3XwQxw",What If
14,ThomasDrufke,Subvert's Cliches,9,26 August 2018,"I'm a sucker for romantic films that subvert the usual cliches of the genre and bring us something new. 'What if' isn't the most original rom-com-dram, but there's incredible chemistry between the leads and contains an electric script. Zoe Kazan, who it sure seems is making a career out of offbeat rom-coms is expectedly fantastic as Chantry, who forms a bond with Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) after he gets his heart broken once again. I hate to make wild comparisons, but it really had the vibe of a spiritual remake of ""When Harry Met Sally"". There are some genuine laugh out loud moments while the heart of the film never wavers. Adam Driver, as Wallace's friend Allan, is also hilarious and nearly steals every scene. A beautiful score and soundtrack curated by AC Newman, familiar tropes venture off into other things, and one solid third act made What If (or 'The F Word' in some countries) is one of the better romance films I have seen in recent memory.9.4/10",What If

This one is one of the rare exceptions where a romantic comedy actually contains something more than just surface feelings. This one feels more real and isn't the typical boy meets girl and they live happily ever after formula. This movie is more along the lines of 500 Days Of Summer, Spectacular Now or Gigantic.

16,eddie_baggins,An enjoyable hipster Rom-Com,6,1 March 2015,"Having finally once and for all trounced the evil incarnate that was Voldemort and saved Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the last time, everyone's favourite boy wizard Harry Potter has ditched his spectacles, his once lover Ginny Weasley (and their children) and his old friends Ron and Hermione for the bright lights of Toronto, Canada to seek out a new world amongst the muggles.It's in this new world that Harry discovers the true troubles of life and making a world for oneself. His heart has been broken by an ex-girlfriend, he lives with his older sister (who he never knew he had) and his only real friend is Adam Sackler from the muggle made TV show Girls. Just when things seem to be getting worse for our wizard friend he meets famous Hollywood director Elia Kazan's granddaughter Zoe who just might be the girl of his dreams (sorry Ginny) expect for one thing, she is dating Timothy Spall's workaholic son Rafe. This leaves poor Harry in a dilemma, how to be a friend to someone you may in fact love and in this tale titled What If, we soon realise that Harry's life is becoming a living embodiment of a Hugh Grant rom-com with mixings of everyone's favourite whimsical romance 500 Days of Summer.We've got the strange and comical best friend, the whip smart dialogue that is funny if wholly unrealistic and the quirky love between two souls that seemed destined for each other, even if they don't fully realise it at the time. Harry shows himself to be a deft hand at comic timing and seemingly enjoying the freedom from being loosened from the old ball and chain that is Ron and Hermione, he appears to be having a blast with his new found life away from the world of magic. Harry's ably supported by his new BFF Zoe and Adam from Girls is always good value, whether it be offering advice to Harry or just generally providing his life with some humour.What If is a neat, quick and eccentric little rom-com that is lovingly directed by Michael Dowse (who directed the awesome and under seen hockey comedy Goon) and well-acted by Daniel Radcliffe (Harry's alter ego) and Ruby Sparks breakout star Zoe Kazan. There are clichés galore in this fairly by the numbers rom-com but there is also enough fresh material here to suggest that a fine helping of originality was imbued into a tale that is easy to watch, funny to listen to and almost assured to be forgotten about once the credits finish. You could do a lot worse for your newest date night movie, and let's just hope that Harry can get over his past trials and enjoy his new life in Toronto.3 freshly cooked batches of Nacho's out of 5",What If
17,leonblackwood,Quite boring and dragged in places. 4/10,4,14 February 2015,"Review: I wasn't really into this movie because it seemed to go round and round in circles, until the obvious happens. Radcliffe is whingeing all the way through the movie about how he likes his best friend, but she is loyal to her boyfriend, so he doesn't know if he should confess his feeling to her. That about rounds up the plot, which drags for an hour and a half, but there are a couple of funny scenes, like when the guy falls out the window. I'm still finding it a bit hard to take look at Radcliffe and not think of him as Harry Potter. His sense of humour if very dry in this film and I didn't really find him that witty, although the script was. The chemistry between the two main characters was OK but at such a young age, they seemed to be caught up in trivial matters. Anyway, the movie is a basic Rom-Com with a lot of unnecessary dialogue and a corny ending. Average!Round-Up: Were does Radcliffe go from here? He really hasn't found his niche yet and his films haven't really smashed the box office. In real life, he is a highly intelligent man, so I think he should take on a role that can use those skills. This movie didn't do him any favours, but I'm sure that he will have his time in the spotlight again, if he picks the right project. I did get fed up with these spoilt brats, who had quite successful personal lives and the money to jump on a plane to Dublin from New York with ease, because they were acting like they had the weight of the world on there shoulders at such a young age. Anyway,  I hope that Radcliffe's next film will stretch his abilities and bring him out of his comfort zone because he's actually not a bad actor. He just hasn't chosen the right movie were he can show off his acting skills and prove that there is more to him than Harry Potter. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $8millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their Rom-Com's about a teenager who falls in love with a girl, who has a boyfriend. 4/10",What If

Likewise Chantry develops a close relationship with her sister Dalia (Megan Park): Dalia at one point attempts a one-night stand with Wallace, but Wallace proves too enduringly attached to Chantry.Daniel Radcliffe doesn't have to do much in the film, apart from adopting an endearingly hang-dog expression whenever circumstances conspire against him. Likewise Kazan has a limited range of facial expressions ranging from quizzical to slightly aggrieved. The stand- out characterization in the film is that of Driver, a tall, rangy young man with a taste for salty conversation who ends up ""settling down"" with Nicole (Mackenzie Davis).The film is way too long - we end up yearning for the predictable end to take place - but the Toronto locations are atmospheric.

In his roommate Allan's party, Wallace meets Allan's cousin Chantry. They immediately becomes very good friends with both of them able to share secrets and have long talks. Chantry lives with long time boyfriend Ben. When Ben goes to Europe for an ultra busy work, Wallace and Chantry get more time to be together. Allan advises Wallace that sooner or later there will be emotional content between him and Chantry. More and more both coincidental situations and their friends try to drive Wallace and Chantry to be together. One night Allan and Nicole hide Wallace and Chantry's clothes while they are skinny dipping so they have to share a blanket together naked. This makes it tense between them and Wallace hates Allan and Nicole for that. Wallace and Chantry don't see each other after that. Chantry gets a promotion offer to Taiwan, and while on her week to think it over she flies to Dublin to Ben. There she finds Ben had already accepted his work's extension. Despite Ben's mitigating way to make it work between them, Chantry decides to leave him. Wallace finally gives in to his heart and follows Chantry to Dublin. He finds only the angry Ben there, who punches him in the face. When they meet again, Chantry was about to say something to Wallace when he tells her the truth about why he flew to Dublin. Chantry resents Wallace due to contradicting their initial agreement as being friends. After deciding that he'll go back to med school, Wallace goes to Chantry's farewell party. There they make up again and a few years later Wallacefollows Chantry to Taiwan where they eventually get married.The story is nicely warm, cute, and witty at the same time that it's adequately funny. Y like how the story opens very plainly and develops Wallace's character seamlessly while the acquaintance and relationship with Chantry has already started. The amount of comedy is just right that it doesn't take the focus off Wallace and Chantry's romance.The jokes are indeed quite rare, but when they appear, they are really funny and enjoyable. I Laughed hard at the 'accidental pushing over the window' scene and Allan and Nicole making out at lunch. And also at the character Dalia can make a giggle out of me due to her outright desperation and insecurity. The romance is also somewhat cute with all those situational aspects of the story. Those aspect are for example the scene where Chantry got stuck in a dress, and the talk about the worst thing happened to to both Wallace and Chantry.The drama even more completes the movie. All those dilemmas Chantry has with Ben, and her and Wallace's silent yet anxious value and moral paradox while she' going out with Wallace kept the mood of the story to a somehow uncertain feeling that it can end at any time. Wallace's effort to be a gentle man by not disturbing what's going on between Chantry and Ben is also a great dilemma depicted to be somewhat haunting Wallace.I like the acting here as a good overall. Daniel Radcliffe can act comfortably with his native accent, still retaining his now-older-Harry- Potter aura and goofy character. Zoe Kazan retains her sanguine image since the last I saw her with Paul Dano in Ruby Sparks (2012). Having Adam Driver and Megan Park further made the comedy aspect even more enjoyable.My score for What If (2013) is a 7 out of 10, and a recommendation is a yes. It's a good entertaining piece of art that has just the right amount of comedy, and drama with the main focus of the romance.",What If
22,rannynm,"A Heartfelt, Genuine, Feel-Good Film with Morals - What a Surprise!",10,20 August 2014,"What If is a new romantic comedy about best friends Wallace and Chantry who have to face the fact that they might have deeper feelings for each other than they imagined. Wallace, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is a med school dropout who has become very anti-social after his serious girlfriend breaks his heart. One night, at his best friend Allan's party, he meets a girl named Chantry. They have an instant connection, but when Wallace learns that she has a long time boyfriend, he decides to focus his energy on being her best friend instead of her lover. The two of them grow closer and closer while still trying to keep the boundaries of ""just friends,"" but will they be able to deny their feelings forever?I really enjoyed this film. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, but the plot is wonderful, the cast is amazing and the story is very touching and funny. The cinematography is great. I especially love the fact that there are some whimsical elements added to the visuals to help tell the story. Chantry is an animator, and occasionally her drawings come to life in the movie, adding a really cool multi-media element to the film.My favorite character is Chantry played by Zoe Kazan. Chantry is a very fun character and Zoe is perfect for the role. I am a big fan of Zoe Kazan and love her work in Ruby Sparks and The Pretty One. She never fails to entertain me. One thing I love about Chantry is that even though you can tell she starts to grow romantic feelings for Wallace, she never crosses the boundaries from platonic to romantic while she's in another relationship which is very cool. I've seen a lot of films where two friends have feelings for each other and they act on it even though one of them is in a relationship with someone else. In this film, it is stated many times that Wallace and Chantry are very against cheating, especially since Wallace's ex cheated on him. I really admire that even though these characters are fictional, they still have solid moral standards. Daniel Radcliffe also does a wonderful job in this film. His character, Wallace is very witty and cynical, adding a lot of comic relief to more intense interactions. He works wonderfully with Zoe Kazan and you can really see the chemistry between their characters. Daniel also pairs perfectly with Adam Driver, who plays his best friend Allan. The two of them make a hilarious combo and any scene with them together is sure to make you laugh. What If is a heartfelt, genuine, feel-good film that I really enjoyed. It is definitely geared more towards adults in my opinion, 20-year-olds will probably enjoy it the most. My mom loved it and was even brought to tears because it is so sweet. However, I love it as well, so I recommend it for ages 15 to 18. I give it 5 out of 5 stars, so make sure you don't miss this gem in theaters now! Reviewed by Raven D., KIDS FIRST!

23,pc95,Fresh and Above Average,7,29 March 2015,"Director Michael Drowse has put together a both funny and touching romance befitting the talents of Michael Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan for ""What If"". Lifting this movie above the rank-and-file is a solid script with introspective and witty conversation. Supporting actors Adam Driver, Megan Park, Mckenzie Davis, and Rafe Spell also run with the script. Driver in particular is excellent blasting off in several scenes. There is some formula involved as there always is with romance and comedy, but this movie and all involved deserve high credit for creating a fresh look.

Daniel Radcliffe just doesn't convince me at all as an actor, and certainly not as a comedy actor. Perhaps it's because I see Potter and not Radcliffe when he appears on screen, but this type of role just doesn't suit him as an actor.'What If' is another generic romantic comedy that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre.

But overall, this movie exudes with charm, wit, and a lively energy. It also does a fine job in exposing how careerism affects relationships.Radcliffe and Kazan lead a fine cast of characters who seem likeable and hilarious especially MacKenzie Davis in a scene as an nervous, sharp-tongued bride-to-be.

29,cultfilmfan,The F Word,10,30 August 2014,"The F Word (titled 'What If' in America) is a breath of fresh air in a summer filled with sequels, comic book movies and just generally the type of films I would normally stay far away from. My city is large enough, but unfortunately has avoided any films that had any artistic merit, or looked to be good in any way (e.g. Richard Linklater's Boyhood and Woody Allen's Magic in the Moonlight among others). The romantic comedy is the type of genre of film that I also usually stay away from. I often find that they have the same repeated and clichéd type of formulas and it is the case where if you have seen one, you have seen them all. Of course there are certainly exceptions to this rule and there have been enough romantic comedies, or films that have dealt with romance, or love in a quirky, or unique way that I have really liked (Punch Drunk Love, or Buffalo 66 are some more recent examples of some of my favourites). For me, The F Word did everything right and I ended up liking the film a lot, maybe even more than I thought I would. I have not seen Daniel Radcliffe in any films following his post Harry Potter career, and to be honest I only saw one of the Harry Potter films and they weren't particularly my thing. I found however, that he was really good in this film and it's nice to see that he has a grown up career and is not just typecast in the boy wizard type of role (the upcoming 'Horns' also looks particularly interesting to me as well). In fact all the performances in this film were excellent. Some of the actors (Radcliffe, Kazan and Driver) I was familiar with, but others not so much, and I still felt they all did a terrific job here. The film is heavy on dialogue at times, but is a very playful and fun film, so those who might avoid a film such as Before Sunrise, or Sunset (while we were mentioning Linklater), because they would find it boring, would probably get a lot more out of The F Word. The film is an intelligent and original romantic comedy, that I think has achieved the task of appealing to fans who like mainstream movie fare, but also those who skip it, like I normally would have. The characters here are intelligent and pleasant people to watch and as the film goes on we get to like them because they are your average everyday characters (especially like most 20 or 30 somethings) and we can relate, care and grow attached to them as well as probably relate in certain aspects with what they are going through, or the complicated issue of dating and relationships. The dialogue is smart and funny featuring at times some crude humour for laughs, but also giving us further insight into the minds, thoughts and lives of these characters and as the film goes on, there is much more to this story and the characters than at first glance, or what we may first perceive by the film's trailers, or the first little bit of the film itself. There were some moments in this film that appear to be familiar enough in the romantic comedy universe, but I did not mind that because I found it such a joy to be around these characters, listen to them and spend an evening watching them in the cinemas. They are a lot more interesting and intelligent than your usual cardboard caricatures of young men and women in mainstream romance films. The film has an excellent pace to it and goes by with capturing your interest from the start and keeping you entertained with story and substance for your money's worth. The screenplay which is based on a play was extremely well written with well developed characters that I liked, found relatable and just enjoyed watching as well as having sharp dialogue that at times was revealing and almost relatable to the zeitgeist going on today. I have met characters like these and they so reminded me of people in that age range and at this current time and atmosphere. The chemistry between Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan, was also very impressive because both deliver great performances, but they are genuinely interesting, pleasant and normal people that we can connect with because they are not superficial, or stereotypical Hollywood creations, but just average joes like you and me. I found so much to like in The F Word, with it's writing, performances and just plain entertainment value and I am so glad that my theatre took a chance on a smaller film like this and decided to show it on the big screen and as I have not been to the theatres since late May, it was a welcome return and a pleasant change to get a film of this calibre late in the Summer like this. For fans of romantic comedies, or even if they are not normally your type of thing, this is still a must see if it is playing anywhere near you.",What If
30,eminkl,What If is ultimately a perfectly decent piece of fluff that thinks it's more subversive than it actually is.,6,17 April 2020,"Aug 28, 2019
To me, it started as a date movie, and then ended up being entirely different, something more. What If Dowse does not seem like a complete fanatic for the mushy gushy romance that Hollywood is infamous and criticized for. He doesn't particularly love the idea of a rainy Saturday evening with warm coffee in bed and Meg Ryan on TV. And maybe that's why, that's the only reason why this film works. I am going to skip way ahead now and give you an example of a scene that basically comes at the end of the film. No spoilers, but there is a scenario in the film where even someone ""outsider"" as the director Michael Dowse from this world, has to drop all his guards and give in to that ultimate date movie scene. And even though he tries with incredible slow camera work and other parlor tricks, he fails to conjure the audience as any other Hugh Grant film would and does. Danielle Radcliff as Wallace and Zoe Kazan as Chantry are the only ones driving the scene to home for us. Another reason why the film succeeds is the safe and secure fall of the film, after Dowse pushes it away from being starry eyed. And this push lands on a pillow whose origin is from that very awkward feeling of running away and bumping into crass slapstick humor. And holding that side of the line is Adam Driver and Mackenzie Davis as a raunchy couple outdoing themselves in each scenario leading our lead couple into trouble- that silence in the car is the highlight of the film. They are the textbook supporting cast of the romcom genre, their goofiness sculpts into a deep prosperous enlightening theme. What If is the most spookiest name I have ever heard of a film especially considering the fact that, to this day, I don't get the title, at all.",What If

Chantry has a long term boyfriend Ben who she is very close to, so it seems they will remain just good friends regardless of whether Wallace wants more.This is pretty much by the numbers rom com storyline.

34,bryank-04844,'What If' is still enjoyable and packs quite a few laughs. I just don't think it's going to be remembered as the great romantic comedy.,6,15 August 2015,"I was very excited to see this new romantic comedy 'What If', starring Daniel Radcliffe, Zoe Kazan, and Adam Driver. I even might have mentioned that it had one of the funniest trailers I had seen in a while, which you can see below. 'What If' answers or at least tries to answer that age old question, ""Can a man and a woman just be friends?"" This concept is definitely not new and has been seen many times before, specifically in the hit comedy 'When Harry Met Sally', which starred a young Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.This Rom-com does nothing new and is a generic paint-by-the-numbers romantic comedy. However, the script, characters, and great performances by the impressive actors, casts a magic and charming spell on its audience, that you'll leave the theater mostly satisfied, even though Radcliffe has no wand in this film. But the usual tropes and jokes of a romantic comedy fill 'What If' up, which was formally titled 'The F Word'.Radcliffe plays a young man named Wallace, who we meet sitting on top of his sister's house in Canada, gazing up at the universe, deciding on whether or not to delete the last message from an ex girlfriend from over a year ago. He does indeed delete the contact and the message, thus signifying that he is finally ready to move on with his life. He finally steps out and attends a party, thrown by his best bud Allan (Adam Driver), where he meets Chantry (Zoe Kazan), as they discuss all sorts of fun things at the party and immediately hit it off.He walks her home, and while she is getting his number to hang out again, she nonchalantly mentions that she has a boyfriend. But Wallace, being the stand up nice guy he is, seems okay with it and the two start to hang out strictly as Platonic friends. Chantry even invites Wallace over for dinner to meet her boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall), a young handsome man who works for the United Nations. Ben's job sends him out of the country for six months, leaving Chantry and Wallace to hang out more often than before, thus growing closer to one another, but never acknowledging or acting on their attraction for one another.But as we've seen many times before, someone has to tell the other how they feel at some point, and we do see the consequences of that. In an awkward but genuine scene when Allan leaves Wallace and Chantry alone on the beach without clothes and vehicle, they are forced to sleep in the same sleeping bag. In what Allan though would lead to them finally talking about their feelings for one another, it ended up in their first fight. And we get to see all sides of a friendship, whether it be the highs or the lows.Radcliffe is amazing here as Wallace, as he gives it his all as an emotional mess from a bad breakup, but trying to ease into the world of love and dating again. He plays it very well. Kazan as always is great, and the two have great emotional chemistry, but the physical chemistry just wasn't there. And of course Adam Driver is perfect as he always is, and is similar to his character on HBO's 'Girls'.I only wish that the film would have ended 10 minutes earlier and didn't have the perfect cookie cutter ending, because while this romantic comedy had the all of the ingredients for a run-of-the-mill Rom-com, I had hoped it would have taken a better approach to its ending, rather than hitting us over the head with a bag of hammers to make us feel happy. That being said, 'What If' is still enjoyable and packs quite a few laughs. I just don't think it's going to be remembered as the great romantic comedy of the year.",What If

Whilst history and experience tells for most people that it is possible it is not however always the case.This tale, like most such has very ordinary beginnings. A guy meets a girl at a party whom he is attracted to, however she lives with her long term boyfriend. He initially throws away her number, their paths cross again and they stay in touch this time.He decides to play along the 'friends' part and even seems to be working...somehow.With the passing of time however their feelings grow and it becomes harder to conceal them yet they try to convince themselves and their common friends that they are just buddies. This cannot go on forever as important life choices ought to be made and if these choices are made on the assumption that they are nothing but friends, it is one thing nonetheless if they are to be more than friends it is quite another.My favourite bit of this film is the slow built up of the acquaintance, attraction, infatuation. The usual ""we fancy one another, jump to bed and then try to figure it out"" did not apply to this story and all the better for it.A rom-com with a heart, and whilst the predictable story elements of such genre were well present its quirky wit and slow development make it a stand out of recent romantic comedies.",What If
37,billygoat1071,Root For The Stars,7,18 August 2014,"What If asks a basic question if a friendship between a boy and a girl could lead their relationship to something romantic. It isn't an idea that we haven't heard before, of course, but for some reason the movie does feel a lot fresh. It offers one thing that we don't always see in a romantic film lately: an ultimately likable on screen couple. They may not be a typical stale supermodel looking pair, the uniqueness it highlights to these characters are their personalities and their problems. It may not make their personal situations any complex, but it still is a memorable little romcom that shines through its humor and performances.The film is best when it only settles with its two leads starting to build their connection into friendship until it gets serious. What makes this love story so genuine is their conversations as friends pouring out their honest views toward something, like love or their lives. Following its central plot would make the clichés visible, but by just looking through the world of these characters is what helps it show its own color. It also sells well when they reveal each of their issues, it sometimes takes them as one of its jokes, but whenever it gets compellingly heavy, it usually resolve those situations too easy. It's probably because it wanted to focus more on its sweetness, but it does still deserve some depth at the unthinkable fate of the ""friendzone"".The depth is instead placed on the actors. There is an undeniable charm to be found in Daniel Radcliffe, even though his character is struck with a cynical side personality and Zoe Kazan brings much of the soul to the connection of every person her character jumps right into. Both of them spark a strangely admirable chemistry that makes the witty screen writing sound more lively. It just embraces the awkwardness of their desires. The direction makes it real simple, though it does pull off a little hipster-y animation when it shows their abstract feelings, but most of the time it just let it linger at the very meaningful moments.The most important thing What If needs is gumption at portraying how doomed the both are from ending up with each other, but it still is a worth a watch for its often delightful environment. Its strongest appeal is just the two stars tagging you along in their world of an uncertain luck. Not sure what kind of people would leave the theater having sudden thoughts of word magnets and art-driven animation, or nachos and Fool's Gold Loaf, but to be sure this film has its distinction as a romantic comedy. Overall, it's all pretty nice.",What If
38,TheSquiss,"Dull, lacking chemistry & obvious despite the occasional zingers. What if? So what?",3,6 August 2014,"Billed as this years 500 Days of Summer, What If is an 'almost' film. It is almost good, it is almost quirky, it is almost very funny, it is almost both romantic and a comedy and it is almost worth mentioning in the same breath as the 2009 Zooey Deschanel/Joseph Gordon-Levitt hit.Almost.What it is, however, is overworked, obvious and eventually tiresome.What If is the story of dropout medical student Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) who, after a string of failed relationships, meets Chantry (Zoe Kazan) an animator who lives with her long-term boyfriend, Ben (Rafe Spall), and forms a close friendship with her. A platonic friendship. This is, after all, another rom-com that asks whether men and women can be just friends. Forget the outcome of this film, surely the answer given by every other rom-com is a resounding 'NO!' There are a couple of funny moments, the window scene, unfortunately presented in the trailer, being the absolute highlight. A vaguely running gag of people tumbling is amusing the first couple of times but is over-egged and even the animation, which at first delights, quickly becomes part of the scenery without adding anything to the value or experience of sitting through What If.There is very little original in What If and less that isn't obvious. While certain scenes feels as though they should have been improvised, it would have required stronger, funnier actors to do so effectively and what we are actually given are various scenes of scripted dialogue in which the stars pretend to improvise.But whilst some of the dialogue is lumpy, Elan Mastai's screenplay, adapted from T.J. Dawe's play, contains some absolute zingers that forced laughter from my belly like an over zealous Heimlich maneuver, chief amongst them Wallace's proclamation of self defence, ""It's not as if I bathed in the blood of an orphan or masturbated over a kitten.""Essential to a rom-com, beyond romance and comedy, is chemistry between the stars. Supporting actors Adam Driver and Mackenzie Davis, as Allan and Nichole, have it in spades. Radcliffe and Kazan? Not so much. Kazan is no Zooey Deschanel and Radcliffe looks uncomfortable to say the least. He has become a much-maligned actor (upon the screen) of late but the trailer for his forthcoming Horns looks as though he may have found a dark and thrilling performance within himself at last. Bring it on! And as for Radcliffe and Kazan's big moment, if that doesn't win an honorary Razzie for Worst Screen Kiss, something is rotten in the state of Hollywood! Eurgh! There are occasional sparkles in What If but for the most part it is dull and it commits the cardinal sin for a romantic comedy: I neither cared about them nor wanted them to finally hook up.What If?

39,willcundallreview,A kinda fun little story,6,17 October 2015,"The F Word also called What If is a romantic comedy about a man named Wallace who can't quite decide when friendship ends and love starts and that puts him at odds with the already in a relationship Chantry. The story follows both as they continue their friendship but you forever see that chemistry throughout and I mean you really want him to say something to her. The movie is a satisfactory watch, it is far from great but it still walks down a well trodden line at least with some quirkiness and some fun characters too. The movie can feel a little too niche at times but manages I feel to make itself fun and bubbly and manages also to add in enough romance within the laughs to not make it over the top going for laughs.Daniel Radcliffe plays Wallace and he does an OK job but I did feel he can be just a little shaky at times. Ever since Harry Potter I have always wanted Radcliffe to do well and really find something that can bring him to a different phase of his career away from the wizarding world, this isn't it but it gives us signs that he is well on his way to having a great career in his post teenage years. Chantry is played by Zoe Kazan who does the same kind of job that Radcliffe does, neither really eclipse each other and that is good because the chemistry runs well through that, we see enough of both characters lives and emotions and it makes them more accessible to us on a connecting level. I liked the addition of Rafe Spall as the partner of Chantry, he gives a funny performance and mixes things up well, I felt he was going to be a little funnier at first but all in all he is still a well made character and played well by Spall too.Michael Dowse directs and I can't say he does a fine job but he still manages to create something alright, I wasn't too keen at times in the way he makes the movie look but he at least gets the pacing right. The movie is written well and even won a Canada Screen Award for best screenplay, I wouldn't say the script is anything special or new but it does run along nicely as a piece and really tries hard to make something work between all involved. The movie can in it's style seem a little too entwined with the modern day ""Hipster"" society through such things as Chantry and her friends knitting, Wallace and his friend Allan (Adam Driver) looking through antique shops and the general use of alternative and indie music although the feeling does not take anything from this as a movie. As Rom-Coms go this doesn't stack up all that well with other one's, in fact it is basically the same as many others although this movie does at least try to be original in its humour and that I can credit it for. The laughs aren't massive in this I have to also add although I think many people will see this as charming comedy rather than the laugh out loud type, they talk about faeces a lot for some reason but it still feels charming though. So in the end this movie is one that probably won't rank high on many peoples lists of great romantic comedies but that doesn't mean it isn't worth a watch, it's actually not a bad movie at all and if you're the kind of movie viewer who is a hopeless romantic or just loves romance, this is pretty fun.",What If

Maybe it's the fact that without his glasses he still looks incredibly young. I loved him in woman in black but I'm not sure this film shows his best side. What if is a story of a boy and a girl who are trying to be friends when one of them is in a relationship with someone else. This film was a series of scenes not quite joined to form a cohesive story. I found the first half to limp along not really sure where the story was going although the second half pulled itself together and made you want to find out what happened at the end. You should make sure that you sit through it least the beginning of the credits as the story carries on being told. This film was set in Toronto, but unfortunately did not portray it as the lovely city that it is, it just came out looking rather dull and run down. It will be interesting to see what Daniel Radcliffe does next.",What If
43,adi_2002,Maybe the L word,5,18 April 2016,"The story of two teens who meets and become lovers after many dates in witch they found out more things about each other. Even though the girl has a boyfriend this will not stop them to end up together.The movie was OK though is foreseeable even from the first 15 minutes. There are many romance film just like this one but unfortunately it's doesn't came with something new to this genre, the content is just filled and the best part is the ending or when the main characters kiss for the first time.Zoe Kazan is cute and a good choice to play the girl who you will end up falling in love. Daniel Radcliffe is adequate but still with an American actor would have help in the compatibility between the two, although we all used to him being the little wizard now he is more mature and manage to make a role of an adult.So the film is watchable, like I said nothing new here but for the fans of the romance and of the actors will be just fine.",What If
44,tfminfl,"Good performances, save the by the numbers feel.",8,26 January 2020,"384. What If. A pretty decent romantic comedy. A very formulaic romantic comedy, tho the performances and a decent soundtrack helped a lot. This is of the 'we can be friends' variety. Wallace a med school drop up, just can't seem to find love, then he meets Chantry at a party, sparks fly. He walks her home, and as that awkward moment of should I kiss her, she drops, yea my boyfriend, blah blah, Wallace stopped listening for a second. Boyfriend? Wtf? Anyway, the sentence ends with here's my number we can be best friends! He's like, yea. Then promptly loses it in the wind. The End. No, fate. They meet up randomly outside of an airport sometime later, and he is so ready to be friends with the girl he has the hots for! Will he find a way to get the girl? Gee, I wonder. Like I said, very formulaic. It is a fun movie, Harry Potter plays Wallace. Zoe Kazan plays Chantry. Wallace's best friend, Allan, is played by Kylo Ren. Its nice to look at and fun to listen to with a cool soundtrack. Check it out. Filmbufftim on FB.",What If

46,mr_bickle_the_pickle,"Cute, funny, charming...but some minor quibbles",8,14 September 2014,"First of all, I absolutely loved how Canadian it was. It was a very nice surprise. But I also loved how witty and funny the script was. This is probably the best acting I've seen Dan do. And Adam Driver was easily the funniest.But here are some little nitpicks I had. Sometimes, I felt the lines or scenes were a little TOO MUCH. Like, did we really need to have dialogue about sharting for instance? We had already established that Allan was kind of a gross guy, it just felt kind of unnecessary to add it in at that point. I also didn't think the ""fake-out"" at the end was necessary. I think the filmmakers thought they were being clever at announcing that *SPOILER* Wallace and Chantry get engaged. But, I felt it didn't work because would they really have a conversation like that in real life? Probably not. Also, that brings me to another point. Even though I liked them together, I want to see more movies where the leads don't actually get together. I mean, it would be refreshing to see something different. Which is probably why I like 500 Days of Summer so much. Although, what I also love about that particular film is they tell you straight up that its not a love story and you still get conned in to thinking they will get together.So my final thoughts are is that I really enjoyed it. And I could definitely see it being the ""When Harry Met Sally"" of our generation.",What If
47,santiagocosme,Romantic comedy apocalypse.,2,23 December 2014,"It's funny how, generally speaking, romantic comedies are considered the perfect kind of movies to watch when you just want to chill and think of nothing. Yet, when I watch one of these, the only thing I do is think. About everything and nothing. But mainly about how rubbish these movies are. There's not one thing new, fresh or memorable in ""What if"". Nothing. Zero. Unless you consider Daniel Radcliffe not being Harry Potter a completely new approach to movie making.If you are into this genre, please disregard my comments, as you may even find something fresh in this predictable plot like other reviews suggest (I smack my forehead in total disbelief). But be aware that watching your favorite romantic comedy for the umpteenth time (even in a foreign language) will probably be more enjoyable than this.",What If
48,nkishudak,Not bad,7,11 August 2020,"Chantry is such an irritating character. Grow up girl🤣 But seriously people should learn how to enjoy their own company. After that you can share your life with someone. Otherwise it'sjust dependence, you expect someone else to make you happy and when the person is gone, your whole personality is gone.
By the way the movie is not bad. Seeing Daniel dancing and naked is like a unicorn under a Rainbow.I can die now.",What If
49,Semisonic,"If that's what hipster romantic comedies are, then i want moar!",8,26 February 2015,"I couldn't come up with a fancy intriguing preface for this review, so let's get straight to business.For me, this movie did the same for the genre of romantic comedies that 'Her' did to sci-fi psychological drama. Stylish and refreshing, putting people's emotions and personalities to the front, managing to stay both artistic and natural, so that the characters never feel boring or washed-out yet you still can connect to their problems and life choices.One thing that first brought my attention to this movie is Daniel Radcliffe. I never was a Harry Potter kind of person, and i didn't even watch all of *those* movies, but i do know who plays whom. And seeing Emma Watson in a number of films, in some of which she was surprisingly good, made me wonder how it is going for the rest of the prime cast of *that* franchise.In case you were wondering about the same thing, let me spill the beans right away. Daniel is awesome here in his role of Wallace. Well, maybe he's generally awesome too, but this movie clearly showed that the British actor pool got one mature star more. He's still young, but his voice, the way he looks in the grown man's clothes, and his impeccably English delivery are all attributes of a first class actor who already got rid of that ""aspiring"" prefix. Actually, watching him made me wonder what Bill Nighy was in his prime.Zoe Kazan, another fresh name in my books, who played Chantry, a main female protagonist here, is also worth the mention. Her performance was hardly Oscar-worthy, but she was absolutely convincing as a person who's loyal to the relationship she's in but can't help questioning the true nature of her feelings towards the person who she sees as a friend. Despite her being six years older, the chemistry between her and Daniel was almost palpable. The rest of the cast, especially Megan Park and Adam Driver, who play Dalia, Chantry's skanky sister on her quest to seduce Wallace, and Allan, Wallace's best friend and at the same time Chantry's cousin, do not disappoint as well. They are a bit outshadowed by the main characters, but each of them has their small moments of glory, which they utilize to the full, making their performance memorable.But actors alone don't make a movie. So, while that British accent adds class to every scene we hear it in, it's the words they say that make this movie really stand out. The guy who wrote the script is hereby proclaimed by my the genius of a sarcastic, and sometimes even cynical, but still good-hearted humor. Something that British movies are really known for, which, in a sense, makes What If one of the most British among the non-British movies i've ever seen. In a world of romantic comedies ridden with clichés and cringe-worthy performances, What If is a breath of fresh air, thanks to its witty and sharp dialogues and that deadpan delivery that cracks you up even more.But mainly, What If is still a feel-good movie. Characters are young and beautiful, good triumphs over evil and hope rises over despair and sadness. So, if you want to see the world around in a bit brighter and more positive way, What If will certainly do the job. And, which is even better, without the classic side effects of the feel-good genre like ""feel-bored"" or ""feel-stupid"" or ""feel-force-fed-and-preached-to"". Finally they learned to make movies like that west of the Atlantic!",What If

51,paul_3-960-896774,"Quirky, funny and realistic",7,8 November 2014,"What If is playing the typical romantic comedy formula, running its characters in every cliché of the gender (male-female friendship with sexual tension, flying oversee to get the girl, boyfriend punches the other dude) but the movie has more to offer.The tone of the movie is one the things that makes the difference, it's really quirky and almost uncomfortable at times, making the dialogues interesting and fresh. Chantry (Zoe Karzan), Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) & their friends have funny moments and speak like regular twenty something friends would. The film is dialogue driven anyway but it's good dialogues so it helps. There's a whole feces theme throughout the movie but it's not weird or disgusting, mind you, I'm probably thinking that because I still have poop conversations with my own friends.Chantry has a boyfriend, you know it, if you've seen the trailer or read the premise, it's the obstacle they have to overcome and the refreshing thing about it was that they didn't turn it into a full blown love triangle. It's all about how they met, their ""friendship"", it's all about Chantry and Wallace. Ben (Rafe Spall) - the boyfriend - is almost part of the backdrop of the story, he's there just enough to remind us that there's an obstacle. The end of the Chantry - Ben relationship was not the cop out ending he/she cheated, it's real life end-of-the-relationship-stuff, done swiftly and tastefully.Toronto was a real surprise and is another thing that helped the movie not falling completely in the romantic-comedy clichés. The F Word is a more realistic version of romantic comedy, it's quirky and funny.",What If
52,FilmMuscle,What If a Rom-Com Was Actually Endearing and Relatable?,8,21 August 2014,"Though it concludes quite predictably and fails to (inspiringly) controvert the point it initially made—females and males, for some reason, just can't exist solely as friends (interesting themes that could've been further explored in that realm)—What If is still incredibly endearing. The film is a rare rom-com that's benefited by sharp, witty, romantic—yet realistic—dialogue and two outstandingly lovable leads in Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan. The two (Wallace and Chantry, respectively) happen to meet at a party in a short span of time, formally instigating a pact to remain as friends—no romantic considerations whatsoever, especially since Chantry already has a big shot for a boyfriend—thereby challenging the conventional notion of male-female relationships/friendships. The audience will quickly steer towards her relationship with Radcliffe, deeming it almost impossible that they don't end up together by the end (excusing the rom-com cliché, of course) because of their spirited, zesty, and remarkably dynamic chemistry—two hopeless romantics who'd rather talk about the deepest of subjects, or delve further into a topic than others usually would, rather than superficially flirt with one another in an incessant manner as is the societal standard. On that note, instead of wasting a narrative's potential by outlining it with the formulaic structure that makes most of its genre frankly unbearable to witness, the majority of the duration is spent on these two interesting characters as friends, giggling and joking and hanging out with friends and shopping. We don't have the instant one-night stand upon their encounter or the trite affair reveals that conveniently lead to the next plot point. Thankfully, the viewer is given time to believe in this potentially heartwarming relationship—a uniquely attractive/cute and quirky woman and a charming, authentic man who honestly has nothing spectacular going on in his life. Perhaps, I'm simply biased in this matter, but you would think that the most relatable romantic comedies would make for the most common and beloved, but that seems to not be the case. Instead, Hollywood gives us repulsive banalities like Something Borrowed and Bride Wars (both of them have Kate Hudson; what a strange coincidence). It's not the loud, obnoxious, and effortless relationships that resonate but the awkward, slow, and naturally evolving; something like the Before trilogy sticks out in that case and while not exactly a romantic comedy, it cements itself as the greatest of romantic movies and the greatest of movies in general. I believe there's an effective concept/design there for studios to consider in future romantic pictures, whether they're comedic or dramatic.With that being said, What If is not a daring romantic drama; so don't expect any narrative risk-taking and thought-provoking themes about relationships and whatnot, but it's remarkably fun and effectively funny regardless. The story also has the company of the always-hilarious and (usually) likable Adam Driver who plays a caring and kind friend (something you don't see too often but you'd love to see anyway). With the right expectations, What If is certainly a sweet treat that makes you feel good and enamors you with its on-screen romance.",What If
53,jacksisjax,Sleazy RomCom,6,7 July 2020,"This isn't a romcom, this a movie about horny people wanting to hook up. The writer of this movie doesn't seem to know what love is, they seem to think that sex=love. Which is rather different from most real relatable rom coms. This isn't real and or relatable. It's horny, it's like it was written by a 14 year old boy. Like way too much poop humor.What is one of the most beloved couples in all of entertainment? Jim and Pam from the office. What makes them so liked by the millions who love the show? It is the most relatable, realistic love story ever put on screen. Why is that? Because the writers of the show understand real life love relationships, they understand that love begins with friendship and not sexy time.This being said I think this movies main message is indeed the two main characters friendship. But this message is rather diluted in a skanky, sex crazed cloud of dialogue. In terms of romance movies, less is always more. This was a little too much.
Pick a lane movie.
I don't think the story is bad though. It is rather textbook, but it works.Daniel Radcliffe and the other chick do indeed have chemistry, which is necessary for any romantic film. The movie has some funny bits, although many of the jokes are awkward and fall flat.
I could give this movie a 5 confidently, but it just isn't THAT bad. I find it disappointing because they kind of missed the mark on something that could have been better. It's a solid 6 or so.Just one guys opinion though!

This is not to say that its predictable, and like many love stores it takes some familiar routes but whats key is the relationship between Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan. Their ability as actors, together with their obvious compatibility onscreen means that this becomes instantly likeable to endure.

Bravo Dowse, Matsai, Dawe and Rinaldi!The graphic art was lovely (no spoilers, but I'd actually really like to see more work by the artist).

Its not as bad as Leap Year (worst film ever made) but its not fit to be mentioned in the same Breath as 500 Days of Summer.It tries way to hard to be quirky and cool which just makes it look childish. The kitchen scene, annoying. Woman falling backwards on the stairs. Annoying.Daniel Radclife is actually the best thing in this film. He's dry English sense of humour works. The girl is sweet and is also OK. But as for the supporting cast, every single one of them is annoying. Rafe Spall is usually very funny (I Give it a Year & X&Y) But he is so bad in this with a woeful American accent that every time he was on screen I wanted to turn it off. The scene in the meeting when his phone rings and he picks it up. Stupid on so many levels. Annoying.It doesn't challenge any stereotypes what so ever, with the predictable ending suggesting that indeed, men and woman can not be friends. To quote a line from the film 'Grow up, not all men want to sleep with every woman they get on with'.If you're a teenager you'll probably like it. I guess its aimed at that market.

It's better to do it on your terms than to have to live through the heartache of it being done on her terms.If you're on the receiving end of the cheater, consider this - people don't change; she'll sooner or later find someone more alluring/attractive/interesting (or simply just different) and she'll do to you what she did to her former partner(s).",What If

61,joeravioli,Can a man and a woman be friends? Obviously not.,6,4 March 2015,"The F Word asks the daring (yet superficial) question of whether a man of a woman can be platonic friends, despite complex emotional connection and mutual affection. The F Word, of course, is ""friend"". The film gets by on its characters: Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe), a cynical med school dropout, and Chantry (Zoe Kazan), a lively, funny, and beautiful girl. Wallace meets Chantry at a party where they immediately make a connection. However, Wallace, upon discovering that Chantry already has a boyfriend, attempts to end their budding relationship before be becomes too deeply involved. Through a series of coincidences, Chantry and Wallace reunite and grow accustomed to each other's company, at most times actively seeking each other out.Daniel Radcliffe is good, now definitely past his ""Harry Potter"" days. We see him as a completely new person, a real, relatable, loser, and we root for him because of it. His cynicism defines his character, and while being annoying at times, serves as the missing piece in the puzzle that Chantry fills for him. It does get bothersome when he dwells on his break-ups (which he does an awful lot). However, it is Zoe Kazan that steals the show, with her lively performance, at times making us laugh, at other times, forcing us to contemplate back onto ourselves. She is kind, but not too nice, she does have her misgivings that make her all the more lovable. If you need a reason to watch this movie, she is that reason. She has perfect chemistry with Daniel Radcliffe, and makes for an extremely likable on screen couple, something that we are not really used to seeing nowadays (Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan? Please.).It is moments like these that make the film worth watching. Wallace and Chantry get to know each other on a highly personal level (often through white hipster stuff, like nice bread and fridge magnets), while Wallace struggles with his moral obligation not to fall in love with Chantry. At times, he fails but at other times, when he does succeed in interacting with Chantry as a friend, it is morally rewarding. We, as an audience numbed by numerous clichéd romantic comedies, begin to yearn for something novel, which is what this film seems to promise. We hope for an ending where the boy does not get the girl, where they just stay friends and the film ends. We hope for an ending where morality triumphs over bleak, boring love. However, The F Word does not follow through with this promise.Wallace struggles with his passion for Chantry, and succumbs to it. They fall in love and get married. I personally left the theater feeling empty, and kind of ripped off. And by the way. Seeing Daniel Radcliffe getting punched in the face got this movie an extra star.",What If
62,LittleLotti,"Predictable, but enjoyable",6,4 January 2016,"It's nice to see Daniel Radcliffe starting to take on some more contemporary roles. As much as I adore Harry Potter, I've never been a big fan of Radcliffe, but he played this role well.This is your standard ""boy falls in love with girl who already has a boyfriend"" flick, but there was something about it that I was drawn into. The conversations between the two main characters felt real and genuine. There were moments where I laughed and moments where I sort of rolled my eyes. I get that Chantry's sister was supposed to be annoying but it was a little over the top for me. In my opinion What If is the perfect movie for a lonely Friday night or Early Sunday afternoon. I always ask myself before I review a book or movie if I would read/watch it again, and I'd have to say yes for this movie. It's definitely for a younger audience maybe between 16-30.",What If

However, in the final days of the summer movie season comes Michael Dowse's ""What If"", a smart and charming romantic comedy. It's a well written film about Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) who becomes friends with Chantry (Zoe Kazan) who is with her long time boyfriend Ben (Rafe Spall). Wallace and Chantry develop feelings for each other and struggle with what to do. It sounds cheesy and boring, but don't miss this film. Elan Mastai's script is sharp and never over extends it hand. It combines several kinds of humor, from slapstick to witty. Mastai's screenplay balances all these humors well while also getting to the heart of the situation. The film has depth and mature conversations about romance and what to do when stuck in a love triangle.The film is also well cast. Radcliffe feels very natural in the role. It's nice to see him play an everyday man instead of some epic famous character. Radcliffe is good at both and this film proves it. He also has good chemistry with Kazan. Radcliffe and Kazan are balanced well with Adam Driver's Allan and Mackenzie Davis' Nicole. Driver is hilarious and steals the scenes. All of them fit their parts very well and give the film its charm.The story can be predictable and maybe a bit forced at times, but its heart warming and grows on you. It uses artistic and visual motifs well and feels well rounded and complete. The film also has a nice indie rock soundtrack that fits right in. ""What If"" seems like a nice blend between "" (500) Days of Summer"" and ""When Harry Met Sally..."". The romantic comedy genre seems to be criticized a lot. There are plenty of junk films in it, but ""What If"" is a gem. It's well written and acted and is able to balance many kinds of humors to please many people.

64,CharlieGreenCG,Welcome to the friend-zone.,9,6 August 2014,"Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) and Chantry (Zoe Kazan) meet at a mutual friend's party and instantly bond with one another. Chemistry between them is flawless and spontaneous – but she has a boyfriend, which leaves recently heart-broken Wallace in the 'friend-zone'.Containing much witty dialogue, quirky references and probably redefining the entire term awkward – 'What If' seems firm and fresh in style, yet is typically conventional in story, hindering on the exact narrative of Harry Met Sally actually ...Lead star Daniel Radcliffe, seems as if he is still trying to get to grips with genre post HP and distancing himself after trying a mixture of features; Woman in Black, Kill Your Darlings, and upcoming horrors; Horns and Frankenstein. Nonetheless, he seems concrete in his first Rom- Com performance and we want to see more.Also interesting to see him play a Brit in an American/Canadian film, rather than putting on an accent like a baffled Hugh Grant we are used to in this Richard Curtis-esqe movie. We see great potential ahead of him and are going to go ahead and call it that Dan' will win an Academy award before 2018 is out.Alongside Radcliffe stars Zoe Kazan in an equally exceptional performance (her best yet), and co-starring upcoming Star Wars actor Adam Driver for even more humour – the film is solid. A film coming from the director of both Goon and Fubur, set our expectations low, but it impressed and entertained by taking and old story and remixing it with an indie feel.'What If' arrives in UK cinemas on the 20th August 2014.",What If

Mainly it's because of Radcliffe and Kazan, the more original dialogues and by staying clear from slapstick comedy. Also the story by itself feels convincing as a whole and the characters stay consistent and relatable for the most part. Though, by the end you also recognize that they slandered a lot of potential by going the usual RomCom route. It could have been better by doing a few things differently, which I'm not going to name here to avoid spoilers.Bottom line, if you like RomComs then you will probably like this one.

Wallace lives on the attic in the house of his sister and seems to have a boring life. He has not much luck with love until he meets Chantry a beautiful young women. A bond grows between the two, at first they are just friends at least that is what Chantry expects. Because as soon as Wallace meets he falls in love with here and keeps hoping for more. But Wallace keeps finding himself in a difficult situation when she appears to have a boyfriend.Personally Romantic-Comedy's are not the type of films I'd go to on a Friday Night or I'd watch on a Saturday evening. I'm just this huge Daniel Radcliffe fan since 2001 who have seen all his films. But he delivers this outstanding performance once again as this ordinary , silly guy named Wallace. He does it fantastic, and he is really, really funny. This film proves again that Daniel Radcliffe is so talented. It wasn't luck that he starred in all those films and got the opportunity to be an actor. He is one of the most talented young actors we have these days. It was not only Daniel Radcliffe's performance is loved but also Zoe Kazan did an fantastic job.The storyline, the script, of the film is really brilliant. The film really develops to the point where both main characters have to make a decision. What should they do with this bond they have ? And the film develops to that moment brilliantly. There is a lot of good comedy in the film, and they brought that over fantastic. The character development was I think alright but dialogs could have been better sometimes.

REALLY???
Is this really a rom-com? I didn't feel anything for either character with their non stop quips in banality it was almost painful. The added necrophilia and excrement consuming parts certainly didn't help. Don't get me wrong, I adore Zoe Kazan. And she and Daniel Radcliffe did as good a job as they could considering the material. But the ONLY character I felt any empathy for was the betrayed boyfriend Ben, played by Rafe Spall who was the unwilling victim in this ""romantic comedy"". It was really sad.
It has been a while since I have seen such horrible selfish characters portrayed as the protagonists in a romantic film. The whole thing left me cold.. And if I ever have to see the likes of Adam Driver again being cast as a sex symbol I am going to seriously lose it. I'm not sure who owes him favors in Hollywood, but I hope the debt is payed in full.
Moments I liked in this film? The ones with lovely English actress Jemima Rooper. I intend hopefully to see her in her other works.
But overall this romantic comedy was neither romantic or comedic..it was just cruel.",What If
72,scottjohnson7896,"The New ""When Harry Met Sally"" (Raging Film Review)",8,17 August 2014,"What If (also known in some places as The F Word) is a film about the place that many--if not all of us--have been put: the oh-so-dreaded friend zone. What If is essentially When Harry Met Sally put in the modern age: can two people be strictly friends while one carries on a long term relationship while the other is deeply in love with their best friend. Luckily, the movie steers away from all of the unrealistic tropes given to us in some recent rom- coms and offers up wonderful and realist look at an issue that plagues us all.Wallace, played by Daniel Radcliffe, has given up on romance. He has finally started to move on from his last girlfriend, but he is still a bit miserable. At a party hosted by his pal Allan (Adam Driver) he creates an instant bond with Chantry (Zoe Kazan), and after chatting all evening, he walks her home only to have the bombshell dropped that she is in a relationship. I don't know about you, but this situation is all too familiar. He gets her number, but since he felt that there was more of a connection than just friendship, he tosses it. Some time passes, and as fate would have it, they find each other again and decide to be friends because he is lonely and she is tired of always being ""that girl with the boyfriend."" They strike up a strong friendship, but obviously Wallace wants and hopes it will go somewhere else.So we follow their friendship through many events that people can relate to. Does he tell her how she feels and have her feel like he's a scumbag with ulterior motives? Does he try to break them up? He is trapped. To make it worse, Chanty's boyfriend, Ben, is an incredibly likable and successful person who Chanty is happy to be with. He does not cheat, lie, or anything that would give Chanty a reason to leave him. This dynamic helps elevate the film from other commonly known character situations because it isn't about one guy being a ""bad guy"" and us yelling at the girl to leave him for the other, it is about both guys being ""good"" and having her decide between who she really wants.Radcliffe and Kazan are marvelous in this, with the former continuing to shed his Harry Potter typecasting and the latter achieving the most ""adorkable"" performance of 2014. Their chemistry is luminous. One hopes that they are actually good friends now because their performances would surely go to waste if they weren't. Radcliffe has done a good job at distancing himself from the wand and glasses, and with more roles like this he will surely be an actor to be reckoned with. Kazan, on the other hand, has the most difficult role in this film; her performance is both lovable and a bit sad to watch because we see her juggling her love for Ben but also the budding emotions that she may or may not be growing for Wallace. With the help of the humorous and real script, their characters come to life off the screen, and they just seem like real people dealing with a real problem and real feelings.Supporting them is a funny and lovable cast of crazy and hilarious friends, coworkers, and siblings. Adam Driver, who can be seen in the upcoming Star Wars film, plays a wild and oddly romantic fellow who finds love too, but his love is a little more bizarre and shared by his partner, played by Mackenzie Davis, and they both watch Wallace struggle with his feelings and dilemma concerning Chantry. Rafe Spall, who plays Ben, is likable too, though we do not exactly want him in the picture. The only thing that really keeps us hating him is the fact that we don't want him and Chantry together, which as I said before, helps make the movie a little more original. In the end, What If is a delightful and honest film about an area that no person wants to be in: the friend zone. It raises questions about love, friendship, and who we are meant to be with, while also dealing with some of the harsh truths that come into play when there is a relationship like this one. Kazan and Radcliffe are utterly delightful in their performances as well, helping make this one of the best romantic comedies to come out all year. So, if you've ever found yourself in a situation like the one in the movie, love Radcliffe, rom- coms, Kazan, or a great chemistry, or if you just want to see a movie that does not involve space or mutants, then What If will surely leave you delighted.For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",What If

On top of fitting into that very category, this film contained those real-life elements that made it so very believable. The chemistry between Zoe Kazan and Daniel Radcliffe was refreshing, and Zoe's fresh transparency in her role was really a highlight. This familiar tale of friendship hiding a deep burning and growing love will touch most viewers, and the character close to the center of the story will probably remind you of someone you know. To watch the secret love that Radcliffe's character harbors come peeking out of the shadows creates a tide of anticipation as the story unfolds - it makes you almost want to feel that youthful pain yourself. It kept me leaning forward through the entire movie. The long distance relationship that strains, the ridiculous and sometimes spot on love advice from friends, and the slow climax of the hide and seek truth make this a colorful gem of a love story.",What If

78,Rachel_Dunphey,The Perfect Recipe,7,15 January 2020,"This movie has everything you need to make the perfect, enjoyable RomCom. It's got your sweet/cheesy romance while still having a good storyline that- unlike hallmark movies- is different from other RomComs; keeping you from feeling like your watching the same movie over and over with different actors.The writing staff did a great job in my opinion, especially with the dry, sarcastic humor between Wallace and Chantry. Daniel Radcliffe (Wallace) and Zoe Kazan (Chantry) deliver the characters sarcastic conversations perfectly! These lines could very easily be over/under acted and completely ruin what makes this couple so fun to watch.I also appreciated how they wrote the background characters - including Dalia (Megan Park), Allan (Adam Driver), and Nicole (Mackenzie Davis). Most supporting characters in these kind of movies have one or two character traits that advance the story, but nothing else. However Allan (for example) is different. He is shown to actually have a life outside the main storyline. We get to see his and Dalia relationship grow and develop into a wonderful marriage. We see them both mature (slightly), have their first fight, and their first child; all in the background! Its a completely different story from the main one being told, but just like in real life it intertwines with it.That's only one example, this is all throughout the story with almost every character we meet.Overall totally worth a watch.

God damn it's been a year and this year's edition is already gone. It's the biggest film festival of the year, of all the pictures that were there i have now seen a massive fifty, which tells a lot about the Festival's quality (since most were good). Though more than done a year ago, the film has only been recently released with a nice warm embrace from critics and audiences. I didn't expect one of the year's best but still hoped it would be a worthy romantic comedy.What If is Directed by Michael Dowse and it stars Daniel Radcliffe, Zoe Kazan, Rafe Spall, Megan Park, Adam Driver, Jemima Rooper and Sarah Gadon. ""WHAT IF is the story of medical school dropout Wallace, who's been repeatedly burned by bad relationships. So while everyone around him, including his roommate Allan seems to be finding the perfect partner, Wallace decides to put his love life on hold. It is then that he meets Chantry an animator who lives with her longtime boyfriend Ben. Wallace and Chantry form an instant connection, striking up a close friendship. Still, there is no denying the chemistry between them, leading the pair to wonder, what if the love of your life is actually your best friend?""Well What If does end up being a worthy romantic comedy i guess. This meaning that's entertaining and charming enough to be worth a watch, no questions asked but i don't really know if it can be much more. I did have an overall good time with it, the movie has enough laughs and the stars are quite brilliant too, the thing though is that i felt as though i had already seen it. This is a fine time at the movies but it does feel way too predictable and overly familiar.It makes me sad not to really like this feature because, you know, i actually really wanted to. Mainly because of the two leads who are quite charismatic and have a good on screen chemistry, but also because it's so clear that the film's intentions are good and that made me overlook some flagrant flaws. And the movie has many of those.I'm having a battle within me right now, a battle between my cynical and cold side who thinks (and rightfully so) that this picture is way too familiar and foreseeable and the other side of me who was quite entertained and charmed by these characters and performances. In the end i think i met somewhere in the middle. Because albeit this is always an enjoyable film to be watching, i did get some moments where i couldn't help but to roll my eyes. It's full of clichés and it's a shame. Full of sub-plots (and the premise too) and supporting characters that felt way too conventional and plain. I mean really the supporting characters though amusing, are little more than card board pieces in the movie's screenplay.So yeah the film is basically saved by it's two lead performances from Potter Daniel Radcliffe and Ruby Sparks Zoe Kazan. I really liked both here and i thought they were also good together on screen. Radcliffe plays his characters well, never makes him too weird or annoying, he gets the right tone of his character. Zoe Kazan is just so cute...i mean how could you not like her. Big blue eyes, i had already liked her in the better and more original Ruby Sparks and she once again charms the screen.What If is undeniably a pleasant movie going experience but unfortunately it does fall short from being much more than that. The two lead performances and a screenplay that ha some funny gags in it, elevate a material that's overall not that great and was made with an approach that wasn't really that inventive. Still i had a good time and i would feel a bit guilty giving a negative score to a film that didn't impress but didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth either.Rating:C+",What If

It was a little weird for me considering his leading lady looked like a little girl for most of the movie I was like is she in her late teens?

83,Mamabadger56,A romantic comedy that's not completely awful,7,13 January 2015,"This is a romantic comedy for people who hate romantic comedies. The story is similar to a lot of rom-coms: Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe), a young man with a history of failed relationships, become the platonic friend of Chantry (Zoe Kazan), who is living with a long term boyfriend. He falls for her, and has to decide how to proceed. The background of their respective friends' love lives provides humour and contrast. But this film is a notch above other films in the category.First, it's actually funny. The quips and banter between characters, particularly between the two main characters, is clever and often hilarious. In fact, the dialogue is the best part of the movie.Second, the plot is not completely full of contrived, unlikely situations designed to either get the couple together or put them in a ""comically"" embarrassing predicament. There are a few, but they are not too outlandish and make sense as part of the story.Third, the ethical issues involved in romantic decisions, such as becoming attracted to someone already committed to another person, are not glossed over. Wallace even refers directly to the attitude (common in rom-coms) that being in love somehow excuses any kind of bad or dishonest behaviour. Wallace has been cheated on himself, and feels it is important to stick to his principles. Chantry's boyfriend is not merely an obstacle to the couple's happy ending; he is a nice person who can be hurt by disloyalty. The movie doesn't treat love as a game, and that's refreshing.Fourth, it's possible for the audience to understand exactly what the couple see in each other - something I find rare in most romantic comedies. Wallace and Chantry are both charming, clever, funny people who make a connection on many levels, and it's easy for us to imagine them happily together, and to cheer them on.A very well done, enjoyable and truly romantic movie.",What If

91,LetwitJr,Funny and fresh comedy,8,9 September 2013,"I went to a screening of the F Word at the Toronto International Film Festival and I can say I had a good time (I can also say that Daniel Radcliffe is much much shorter in person than what you would expect.) I wasn't sure what the story was or what type of movie it would be and from the director of Goon and Fubar, I probably wouldn't have expected a romantic comedy, but as it turns out it was and I quite enjoyed it. The film tells the story of Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) and Chantry (Zoe Kazan) who meet at a party when Wallace finally gets over being dumped over a year ago and goes back into the world. He soon finds out that Chantry has a boyfriend but the two of them decide they'll give a go at being friends. Both characters are somewhat awkward and seem to have little friends outside of Allan (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Mackenzie Davis). Their best friends are common friends but for some unknown reason they had never met before, probably due to Wallace being somewhat emotionally unstable and completely shut off in his apartment for months on end. The film is predictable overall but still brings some fresh moments. I absolutely love Adam Driver and he plays more or less the same character he plays on Girls but it was great to see him here. The characters are lovable in their awkwardness and shyness and you do hope for them to get together. They're also quite believable. Wallace was in med school but dropped out (still because he got dumped honestly, Wallace can't really handle being dumped) and now works at an alienating low end job, while Chantry has that girl next door look and works in an animation studio, with pressure to accept a promotion she's not sure she wants. The film is cute for sure, but also really funny at times. I'm not a huge fan of Daniel Radcliffe to begin with, having seen him only in the obligatory Harry Potter series and the Woman in Black but he was quite good, and different. It's a bit slow but I can't say that was an issue for me. Toronto is featured a lot as the film was shot and takes place there (for once, they're not pretending it's New York) so it was great to see the city.While there is no release date set, the director said the movie should come out around Valentine's Day so by all means, if you're looking for a fun comedy to watch, go see it.

The girlfriends, boyfriends and spouses are just sort of extras in the way of the love story. This always makes the story less romantic to me. At least this movie doesn't deny it, since the issue of cheating is actually talked about throughout the movie. Wallace has a friend Allan whose current relationship started with cheating, and neither Allan or his girlfriend Nicole seem to see anything wrong with that, quite the contrary.The writing is good and there are some genuinely funny moments with Wallace and Chantry joking with one another. I also like the scene where Chantry's bitchy-but-not-completely-evil sister is about to tell her a vicious lie about Wallace but then apparently changes her mind mid-sentence and ends up turning the story into a joke, saying something like ""and then the cops came and Wallace shot them all in the head, he's such a jerk"".I don't get the comparisons to ""When Harry met Sally"". Wallace has a crush on Chantry from the first time they meet, and it's hardly one-sided either, so theirs is never a real friendship like that of Harry and Sally.

The story starts of with meeting the two leads, Wallace (Daniel Radcliffe) and Chantry (Zoe Kazan). Wallace is in need of love, and is torn between becoming a friend of Chantry's, or her lover. The problem, is that Chantry is all ready engaged to someone else. The acting in this movie was quite surprising, as Radcliffe, who is slowly being seen as a normal actor, instead of Harry Potter, plays the part of Wallace well, and stays in character quite well. Zoe Kazan also plays the part of Chantry quite well. The two strong performances by the leads, is one of the big factors why this movie was good. I also felt that Adam Driver played the supporting role perfectly, as he was the easygoing best friend of Wallace, and was one of the reasons why this movie was funny. The one problem with the characters, however, is that they are relatively clichéd, and hardcore movie watchers may not be too fond of that. The one place where the movie could have made a much better improvement, was taking more advantage of using Toronto as the main backdrop. Truth is, a lot of movies do not take place in Toronto, and the idea of using it as a backdrop was perfect. The problem was, there could have been a lot more scenes in Toronto, as Toronto is realistically a great spot for young adults to live.

However due to the conversations between the lead two characters which was mainly about excrement it seemed very narrow for the wider enjoyment of the audiences attracted from the trailer and casting. This factor meant that I lowered my rating of the film.The film seems much more real than others in the genre with the different life and relationship problems and how they are dealt with by the characters.

103,erika_marselina,I'm picky when it comes to Rom-Coms but this was cute.,8,6 August 2015,"Overall 8/10. It was a cute movie, the storyline kept me interested and I very much enjoyed seeing Daniel Radcliffe in a different, less serious role compared to others I've seen. I think most Rom-Coms & chick-flicks are never more than an 8/10 rating anyway. Usually a 7-8 at best, most are just okay around 5-6 and then many that are pretty awful with a <5 rating.Anyway, I enjoyed it and I think it's worth seeing if you're a fan of the lovey-cutesy romance chick-flicks. Daniel Radcliffe is a cutie pie too so that helps. :)Chantry is an awful name though, not sure why on earth that's the lead female's name in the film. It's awkward to say and it's ugly name.",What If

What If adds nothing original to the Romantic Comedy Genre. However, Daniel Radcliffe, who plays Wallace, is very sweet and likable in his role, and is perhaps a diamond in the rough out of this film.

And it was touching. It would probably be in the ""chick flick"" category, but that's an unfortunate way to pigeonhole this movie. Spoiler alert!!! (I just want to be on the safe side.) I would classify this movie as an updated version of When Harry Met Sally. Daniel Radcliffe is excellent, as is the rest of the cast. We went to a sneak preview a few days ago and I was kind of shocked to read that it was made last year(2013) and ""might have a Valentine 2014 release"". What the heck happened?

Maybe something a little quirky. However, the problem is, I just did not find either of the two main characters to be all that appealing. No matter how hard I try, Daniel Radcliff just does not do it for me. He certainly does not make a good lead in a romantic comedy. I felt like he was just trying waaaay to hard to be so nerdy he is likable. The jokes were almost always close to funny in this, yet none of them were homeruns. The romance was similar. It was almost close to romantic, but no homerun. Daniel Radcliff and the girl were almost close to likable and relateable, and realistic, but not quite. The end (no spoilers here) was almost great, but not quite. In the end, the movie is almost good, but not quite.",What If
108,TurquoiseSky,Feeble Romantic Comedy with Poop Talk,3,24 August 2014,"Boy meets girl. Girl already has boyfriend. Boy hangs around wishing he could date girl. That's how most of this movie goes. What makes it worse than usual is that the pre-existing couple don't seem to need to break up. They seem like a good couple; the boyfriend seems like a good boyfriend. The female in question and the protagonist have some tolerable banter together but nothing worth breaking up a relationship for. They don't have that much chemistry. Most of the actors in this movie are average looking and there aren't a lot of sparks flying around. Maybe that explains why it hasn't done very well at the theater. The script sucks. T.J. Dawe wrote the play it is based on and Elan Mastai wrote the screenplay. They must be terrible writers. There a bit about how they went through 10,000 names to come up with the name for Cool Whip. This is deadly dull. They used it twice. There's a thing with a butterfly symbol that is overplayed. There's a thing with serious white trash food. Supposely the two sylph-like actors are bonding over bacon, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. I wasn't buying that one. The thing that takes this from being a feeble romantic comedy you could almost tolerate and makes it something else is poop talk. Lots of talk about doo doo and colons. There's also talk about body parts getting mutilated, graphic outtakes from a horror movie, and a scene where a character takes a nasty fall that I could have done without. I'm guessing T.J. Dawe's toilet training was handled unwisely.This movie picks up in the end but it isn't worth sitting through the rest of it.",What If
109,baz-b,When Harry Potter met Sally,6,14 August 2014,"I would like to say that I went to see the preview of this film with an open mind, but in reality I expected it to be predictable and clichéd. In actual fact, whilst it was somewhat predictable (it's a rom-com, you can take a good guess at the ending from the opening scene!)... it was actually not entirely what I expected.Daniel Radcliffe plays the lead role in this film that seeks to find whether men and women can be platonic friends. The woman in question is played by Zoe Kazan. The film is set between Toronto and Dublin - yes Toronto, which usually impersonates various US cities in movies with limited budgets actually gets to play itself for once!Stewing over a recent breakup, Wallace (Radcliffe) works at a textbook company while living in his sister's attic (an improvement over the cupboard under the stairs, at least). He's primed for romance when he encounters Chantry (Kazan), spewing whimsy and animated sketches in her wake. Sparks fly only to be put out when Chantry mentions her boyfriend and asks if they can just be friends.In one of the early scenes of 'What If,' Wallace moves word magnets around a fridge, spelling out, 'love is stupid.' Most romantic comedies would stop there so the leading man could reflect somberly on the words. Instead, Wallace adds, 'stupid monkeys dancing in a slapstick hurricane.' This sets the theme for the entire film, awkward conversations making bad jokes at the wrong time. It is the characters of Wallace and Chantry that not only save this film from being yet another generic rom-com, but that lift it far beyond the confines of the genre so that you almost forget that we're going to end up where we always do with these types of stories. However, it's telling just how soon after the credits roll that you forget about 'What If'. Engaging all the way through, and a wonderful showcase for its two stars, but perhaps that bit of subtext would have given this film more of a shelf life. I was almost at one point expecting them to just remain friends, but that is far too risky for a movie of this derivative, and so an improbably convenient happy ending is duly manufactured. Whilst I expected to be annoyed by this film for being dull, predictable and clichéd, it was not actually so bad. In fact, the most annoying thing is that the title of the 'What If' film contains neither a question mark, nor an ellipsis ('What If... someone made a rom-com that didn't strictly adhere to formula?).Overall verdict: 'What If' breathes life into the tired rom-com formula through its whimsical script and quirky cast.

Daniel Radcliffe as Wallace erased his Harry Potter image to me into a romantic who just doesn't have the right scene in life. He managed to look witty in front to me even if he's a romantic in this film and it still worked.Zoe Kazan as Chantry did justice to her character. She did awesome portraying a woman who wants a guy friend when she has a boyfriend that is confused with her feelings. Did that make sense? Well it did to me because she acted greatHere comes the spoiler: I like the fact that they didn't do any typical friendzone stuff here at this movie like the confession and cheating kind of things you see in other movies. Chantry didn't cheat on Ben and Wallace stayed true to what he said about cheating and it made me happy to see that. I also liked the fact that Wallace didn't get the time to confess his feelings in a cheesy cliché-ic way and that he only did it in the end where it didn't matter because Chantry was going to go anyway. The ending in this movie made it awesome to me, I was hoping for a Sad Justifiable ending or a happy ending but this movie gave me a light hearted touchy feel ending that would make any viewer feel differently after the first few moments",What If

I'm not saying Daniel can just play Harry Potter, I'm just saying this movie did not appeal to me and there are heaps of other romantic movies that deals with subject in a much more interesting way.

Radcliffe is charming, witty and strikes up amazing chemistry on- screen with his co-stars and that is what really brings this movie to life. Of course 'What If' is never going to be a classic that's remembered years down the line but it's fun and respectable and definitely leaves you with a smile. It's completely predictable but isn't that what we all secretly want from a romance story? Wallace and Chantry are unbelievably cute together, their sweet little inside jokes and flirty insults have you rooting for them the whole time. My only problem with 'What If' is the disappointing and frankly rather dull ending. After watching almost an hour and a half of Wallace and Chantry battling against their feelings for one another it's a bit of a cop out to skip ahead several years and show them happily married and madly in love. It would have been nice to see a bit more of their story as a couple but I still enjoyed it nonetheless,A witty and modern love story that has you smiling most of the time.

He's grown up, and I no longer automatically think, Harry Potter, when I see him as all these other reviewers seem to see him. In college, I had a teacher who would tell you there were only 7 stories, so yes, maybe it has parallels to to When Harry Met Sally, so what?

I personally resonate with the story, as with, perhaps, those who witnessed the liquid love in the age of global division and collaboration of labors as well as the loneliness and diaspora that come along. The blurred yet articulated lines between friendship and love affair are handled pretty well in the story.There also seems to be a trend nowadays for movies to peppered with animations and imaginative scenes that did not really happened. These ideas are implemented elegantly here in proportion to the reality of what actually happened.Yet, speaking of the reality, the only beef I have with this lovely movie is that people seem to live in a time with no instant texting or even email. Perhaps the minimal usage of mobile devices in the story is intentional, given how many movies embrace this technological scene of simultaneity nowadays. However, it does leave some discrepancy in the plot as to why people do all those surprise visits without any advance notice.All in all I enjoy the movie and recommend it to those who also enjoy a good romance that are increasingly rare these days.",What If

It's sometimes seen as a bit of a man-thing it seems to dislike Rom-Coms but I'm quite open to them and willing to judge them on what I actually make of them myself. I've seen many that I have enjoyed and lots that are okay. This is without doubt the worst that I've ever had the displeasure to sit through in a cinema.This film is quite awful. I managed one slight chuckle in the whole film when the sister of the character played by Daniel Radcliffe nearly choked on a sandwich. Otherwise there was nothing in the whole script that was amusing in the slightest. Other reviewers have mentioned the excellent plot. Now there's the biggest laugh of all! It was as if a group of 12 year old girls had devised the plot (if you can call it a plot). Sorry, that's probably an injustice to the creative abilities of many 12 year old girls.The acting was dreadful. I'm surprised that Daniel Radcliffe has put his name to this effort. It will do little for his career. Nobody else in the film made any impression upon me. The female lead I will keep an eye out for in the future, if only to ensure that I never see any of her future performances.The child-like animations that kept popping up we're extremely annoying.

It tries to hide its redundancy with a ""hip, indie"" vibe and ""snappy"" dialogue but the reality is it's a script where the words that come out of the characters mouths are recycled from every single rom-com from the last 3 decades. And they just don't. stop. talking. Just shutthehellupalready. The clichés are endless and the story drags like a dead elephant being hauled by an aging horse. ""I'll look if you look""?!?! Jesus, are you serious? Was that actually written in the script by someone who got paid? There was a critic review that said it best when mentioning that is also fails to address proper boundaries in relationships and it absolutely does. The characters are shallow, and one-dimensional.

No spoilers, I just feel like it should be said that there are moments where the predictability is compromised and there is some doubt of whether or not the narrative will carry out with the expected ending, but it's not some gigantic dramatic blow up. It feels very natural, heck the entire movie feels very natural from the character choices of the actors to the colloquial nature of the dialogue. The humor is consistent, and there are running themes and jokes that thread into the story with ease. It may feel semi-forced in some places due to some of the actions the characters perform or the choices they make, but it fits into the universe of the movie. You may have think over these bits for a moment, but the overall direction and writing of the film is fantastic and witty and just makes you feel good.

And the characters in the movie are all amazing, the cast all had great chemistry and bounced of each other really well, especially Daniel Radcliffe and Zoe Kazan. The fantastic character dynamics is what really sets this movie apart from other movies like it, I never felt like a character was just a standard movie trope or a caricature of themselves.
