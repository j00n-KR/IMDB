0,Leofwine_draca,"As simple as Die Hard on a plane, and all the better for it",7,25 February 2018,"AIR FORCE ONE is one of the last wave of 'DIE HARD IN A...' Hollywood flicks inspired by the Bruce Willis blockbuster, although DIE HARD rip-offs would continue in B-movie cinema for years to come (and are still being made, in fact). This film has Harrison Ford's everyman US president tackling a gang of murderous Russian terrorists who have stormed Air Force One and are willing to sacrifice the hostages for their political ends. The film is dated and more than a little cheesy in some of the sentimental scenes (the black woman on the parachute is one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes you'll find here) and the CGI effects haven't dated too well either. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it. Wolfgang Petersen brings some of the same claustrophobia as he mined in DAS BOOT and even manages to fit Jurgen Prochnow into a little role. Ford and Michael Douglas were my favourite Hollywood thriller stars of the 1980s and 1990s and Ford does well here as the tough yet believable character. There's plenty of suspense and action throughout and the latter scenes are well staged and exciting. Gary Oldman reprises his volatile villain role from LEON to strong effect and as a whole this is an entertaining package where you can just switch off and enjoy.",Air Force One
1,SnoopyStyle,"Too many climaxes, too many slow parts",6,27 September 2013,"President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is a no non-sense leader who just gave a zero tolerance on terrorism speech. Ironically, terrorists hijackers take over Air Force One. Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) the leader of the terrorists is a Russian nationalist looking to free General Radek (Jürgen Prochnow) and replace the Russian government.Wolfgang Petersen directs this action movie. Forget about any realism problems, this is strictly a popcorn movie. There is no need to turn on your brain. Harrison Ford is a credible president, and more importantly, he is a credible action hero. The vice president (Glenn Close) is running things from the White House.There is just too much talking, negotiating, and too much international politics seriousness. At over 2 hours, there are too many slow parts. And the ending has way too many climaxes. They should think about who needs to be killed last. They should kill the big bad last because that should be the one big climax.",Air Force One
2,Hitchcoc,Anything is not possible!,6,6 April 2006,"It's interesting that when Hollywood wants to, it can stretch the limits of the plausible and implant its own way of doing things. So many writers have used the expression, ""Anything is possible."" This is one of those expressions that is so overused. Lawyers get a witness to say that a one in a trillion DNA sample may be tainted because, ""Well, anything's possible."" A film has a duty to the viewer to have a sense of realism. The ease with which terrorists and other entities are able to infiltrate in many books and movies is insulting. Now, if an intricate plan has been hatched with many levels of difficulty, leading to the infiltration, then the plot continues, it's acceptable. Most of these movies get their principles in their and then the actual event occurs. Generally, Harrison Ford movies can be depended upon. This one just doesn't cut the mustard. It also has gratuitous violence, generally directed toward the less attractive persons.",Air Force One
3,mark.waltz,It's your turn to be afraid!,10,22 January 2021,"That's the message of United States president Harrison Ford to international terrorists in this political thriller that is still a crowd pleaser today just as it was during Bill Clinton's second term. Instead of Hilary, we've got the formidable Glenn Close, promoted from first lady along side Jack Nicholson's president in ""Mars Attacks!"" to vice president, 24 years before we actually got a female VP. To balance out the star power, the less famous Wendy Crewson plays the first lady and she's equally commanding.Maybe America's never had such a perfect president but Ford has the audience on his side from the moment he makes that riveting speech in this pre-9/11 world. He's got a beautiful wife and daughter and a strong moral code (as evidenced by the sweet music when he speaks with his wife) but now he has a more pressing problem. On his way back from Russia, Air Force One is hijacked and he must not only protect himself and his family but the crew and staff as well.There is a slyness about the script that is thrilling as the characters are developed and the plot unfolds. Gary Oldman, as the Russian mastermind behind the hijacking, does his best to rattle Close. utilizing insults to make her lose her cool which does not happen. Perhaps it's a bit contrived, but it's brilliantly so. The American officials both on the plane and in the capital use varying aggressions to have this handled the way they seem fit, and there are a few who would favor just taking the plane down, president or not, to see this end. But with Glenn Close in charge as the president remains in peril, there's no way she'll sacrifice her ethics to become president.This is action packed, emotional and one of Hollywood's best fictional looks at American politics and world intrigue. You've got Gary Oldman a most evil villain and Dean Stockwell fighting Close in Washington over obtaining power so that adds a sexist element to the intrigue as well. The design of this version of Air Force One is something to see as well, the Grand Hotel of presidential jets. At times, the tension really is too much, but it's obvious that Ford has an angel over his shoulder and that good vs. evil will end once again with good triumphing.",Air Force One
4,gavin6942,"When Harrison Ford is President, All Hell Breaks Loose",7,16 October 2006,"Harrison Ford plays a president who refuses to negotiate with terrorists. But after one terrorist (Gary Oldman) hijacks the Air Force One and the president's wife and daughter, maybe he will have to rethink his position.Allegedly, Kevin Costner was supposed to be playing the president. Boy am I glad he was too busy making ""The Postman"" for this movie. Not only did he make a great Postman, but he would have made a horrible president. When you want drama, you call Costner. When you want action, you call Bruce Willis. When you want the perfect blend of drama and action, you call Harrison Ford (think ""The Fugitive"", for example... don't think ""Star Wars"").Ford is great as a diplomat, but equally as good with a gun and in a fight. But the real star of this is Gary Oldman, who plays an evil and soulless terrorist determined to get his old general freed from prison. Oldman plays it like he means it, killing mercilessly while still appearing cold and calculated rather than insane. The writer even had the decency to have Oldman deliver lines condemning the president for bombing villages while being against terror.Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell made great supporting stars, and even William H. Macy seemed a little less flamboyant than usual in his role as a military man.This film is especially interesting in the context of our current president, George W. Bush. Bush has also gone on record many times for not negotiating with terrorists and takes a hardline approach similar to Harrison Ford. What would Bush do if terrorists hijacked his plane or kidnapped his family? Even giving me that visual image made this film worth the viewing.",Air Force One
5,lee_eisenberg,"quite enjoyable, as long as you can completely suspend reality",5,6 March 2007,"So, terrorists hijack the president's plane and the prez goes into attack mode. Since Harrison Ford plays the commander-in-chief, you can probably guess what that means. Personally, I wish that a movie would portray American terrorists; why do Russians always have to be the bad guys? And there are a number of scenes that anyone could easily identify as totally unrealistic (hint: they involve parts of the plane getting opened). As for that line ""He fought alongside me in Afghanistan"", that merely brings to mind how the Soviet invasion of that country partly led to the current state of the world.Still, ""Air Force One"" is a pretty fun ride. Gary Oldman makes one nasty terrorist leader. Yes, it's just another big Hollywood movie that makes little if any sense, but as long as you understand that it lacks any realism, it's OK. Also starring Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, William H. Macy, Dean Stockwell and Jurgen Prochnow.",Air Force One
6,jboothmillard,Air Force One,8,15 June 2005,"If you like great action thrillers, then you'll enjoy this film from director Wolfgang Petersen (In the Line of Fire). Basically the President of the United States, James Marshall (Harrison Ford) is heading home after making a speech in Moscow on his famous plane, Air Force One. But on the journey, the plane is hijacked by Russian terrorists, led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman). The President supposedly got in the escape pod before they could get to him, but he didn't, he has stayed on, got a gun (he has experience of battle) and is trying to communicate to the authorities, land the plane and save his wife Grace (Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice (Liesel Matthews). Oh, I should mention that the guns shooting is okay, because the plane is able to withstand that sort of attack (from the inside anyway). The Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) on the ground is trying to renegotiate with the terrorists' demands to release convicted General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), but they will shoot a hostage every half hour they take to get it done. Eventually Korshunov is aware the President is still on the plane, and the one causing them problems, e.g. fuel loss and outside attacks, but Marshall manages to save the day getting many hostages off, killing those that deserve it, and getting out alive before the plane crashes. Also starring Paul Guilfoyle as Chief of Staff Lloyd 'Shep' Shepherd, Terminator 2's Xander Berkeley as Secret Service Agent Gibbs, William H. Macy as Major Caldwell, Dean Stockwell as Defense Secretary Walter Dean, Andrew Divoff as Boris Bazylev and Bruce Almighty's Philip Baker Hall as U.S. Atty. General Andrew Ward. This is probably one of the only films where the U.S. President kicks ass instead of someone else doing it for him, e.g. bodyguard, FBI agent. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Gary Oldman was number 40, and Harrison Ford number 5 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Oldman was also number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 36 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Air Force One
7,ccthemovieman-1,"High Tension, Action, Heroism & PC",6,2 December 2005,"A very clichéd but interesting film with a two-fisted President of the United States (Harrison Ford) literally taking on terrorism himself on board his jet, Air Force One. Believable? Of course not, but it's an story that hooks you in and keeps you involved all the way. It could have been trimmed down, to be sure, but the better-than-average action scenes help make up for that. While not blatant, the film did have it's typical Hollywood Liberal slant with political correctness abounding....so be aware of that. It borders on reverse sexism and racism and there is a fair share of profanity in here if you are concerned about that. The sound on the DVD is tremendous with some excellent rear speaker action. It would be great demo model for anyone's surround sound system. It adds measurably to the enjoyment of the film. If you like action and a lot of tension, this film has it. It's one of those movies that wears you out by the end of it!",Air Force One
8,rmax304823,Breathtaking compendium of clichés,2,11 February 2006,"""The plane is damaged, one of his engines is out, and he's leaking fuel. How can he make it?"" Something like that anyway. The clichés came so thick and fast I couldn't remember them all. I couldn't even GRASP them all quickly enough, piled as they were, one atop the other, like a pile of Leggos.I don't really think it's necessary to bother with the script except to say a rogue group of Russians hijacks Air Force One, is overcome by the President of the United States, and most of the good guys are saved and all of the bad guys perish, usually in some colorful fashion.Wolfgang Petersen made a gripping movie with ""Das Boot."" It was a long flick of mostly quiet moments, a leisurely examination of life aboard a U-Boat, punctuated with shocking moments of action. In ""Air Force One"" Petersen's talents have been -- dare I say ""hijacked"" by Hollywood? There is no leisurely examination of anything. There is neither leisure nor examination. All the parts that might bore a twelve-year-old weaned on Call of Duty have been cut out of the script and nothing is left but one recycled action scene after another, some of them already parodied in ""Airplane"", backed up by a booming score.Here's an indication of how the movie was assembled, the kind of thought that went into it. When it was released there appeared an article in the NY Times written by an actor (whose name I now forget) playing one of the characters (whose name I don't know) in innocent conversation with Harrison Ford as the President, when shots are heard from elsewhere in Air Force One as the takeover starts.As the actor described the first run-through, at the sound of the gunshots, he rose to his feet and sauntered over to the window to find out what was up. He was told he'd have to jump to his feet and run to the door. ""Why?"" he asked. ""The Secret Service is aboard, there are security agents all over. Nobody could possibly be expecting an armed attack. A normal reaction would be to try to find out what the noise was."" He was told by the director that everyone in the scene would immediately recognize the gunshots for exactly what they were. Ford, a seasoned veteran of such attacks, told the actor tiredly, ""They're gunshots, period."" Why waste three or four flaccid seconds having the actor stroll to the door? That kind of dedication and efficiency is in evidence throughout ""Air Force One."" Bang, bang, whoosh, zap. The President, by the way, is practically superhuman. He speaks Russian albeit with a gloopi American accent. He cuts his bound wrists free and immediately disarms and kills two or three of his captors. I lost count. Well, okay, he was a CMH winner. But then how did he learn to fly a jumbo jet? Never mind.A more interesting question is how did they pick the villains? Kazakhistan rebels? A rogue group of Russians? This is rather retro stuff because absolutely nobody watching the movie knows or cares about Kazakhistan or its internal affairs. The simple fact is that viewers will see and hear the heavies speaking Russian and that will be enough for them. (I forget when ""Crimson Tide"" was released, using the same ploy. It's the Russkies again alright, only a splinter group.) The faces of American fighter pilots are illuminated by a comforting pale off-white light, while their opposite numbers are as green as algae. To top it off, the Russian Premier looks like Jonathan Winters coming down from battery acid while our President looks exactly like Harrison Ford. And if you STILL don't get the point, the Kazakhhomaniac rebels sing a rousing version of ""Die Internazionale."" Nowadays, of course, nine years later, they'd all be speaking Arabic.The movie offers some fascinating tidbits in addition to its knuckle-whitening suspense. The set representing the interior of Air Force One, for instance. It's full of nooks and crannies and it seems about the size of the Dixie Hotel. Functional furniture, but comfortable and expensive. Soundproof, bulletproof, insulated against an atomic blast. A staff of well-trained servants who know when to leave the master alone to ponder weighty questions about the world's future. (In all these respects it rather resembles my place.) It also has a steam pipe, which the list of clichés calls for, just as in those factories or warehouses in which the final shootout takes place in other action movies. The steam pipe is shot up and people in pursuit of each other wisp their way through the mist. What is that steam pipe doing there? Have we been mistaken all these years about how jet engines work? Are modern airplanes really powered by the same plants that made the Stanley Steamer roll on its merry way? I half expected Ford to stumble across the gigantic elastic band that spun the engine blandes. What makes it finally so preposterous is the notion that this or any other country could organize itself with such alacrity and efficiency in the face of an unexpected emergency of these proportions. When the president finally contacts the situation room and asks who has taken over Air Force One, the reply is, ""A group of Russian ultra-nationalists."" This is nothing more than cashing in on ancient hatreds for a buck. And we pay for that self satisfaction on the world stage, by damaging the image of America abroad. How about a Russian movie in which a group of murdering thugs tries to kidnap Vladimir Putin and they are called ""American ultra-nationalists""? How would we respond?As propaganda it is retrograde and execrable crap. As a movie, it's just another ""Airport 97"" with the president and his family aboard.",Air Force One
9,moonspinner55,One-dimensional masochism,5,9 June 2007,"The U.S. Presidential plane is hijacked by despicable Russians, who attempt to terrorize granite-jawed leader Harrison Ford along with his family and government aides; they want the Pres to demand the release of a Russian neo-nationalist, but he has other ideas and plots to turn the tables. Well-made but overly-familiar thriller is rather like ""Die Hard"" in the sky, though Ford is certainly adept and convincing as the President; Glenn Close commanding as the Vice President; Gary Oldman scary but typecast (and one-dimensional) as the terrorist leader--what kind of movie would this have been if Oldman and Ford had switched roles?

10,blanche-2,"""Get off my plane""",8,13 September 2016,"Just imagine if we had Harrison Ford as President. You can't beat him as a fantasy holder of the highest office in the land.""Air Force One"" from 1997 is like many special effects films - it's preposterous. I for one, could not have cared less. It was so exciting, so suspenseful, so tension-filled that I couldn't stop watching. It's also strangely prescient of 9/11; we just had the fifteenth anniversary of that yesterday, and it was sad and horrible.The film begins with an American Special Forces unit capturing General Ivan Radek (Jurgen Prochnow), the dictator of Kazakhstan, being captured by the American Special Forces. His regime was bloody, and he was rumored to be stockpiling nuclear weapons. The capture was due to the joint effort of the President and President Petrov of Russia.A short time later, Marshall and his family (Wendy Crewson and Liesel Matthews) travel to Russia, where Marshall is honored for his help. Marshall takes the opportunity to break from his prepared speech, stating that the world has been too slow to act against terrorism, and says that the U.S. is beginning a ""zero tolerance"" policy against it.The Marshall's return to Air Force One, which will take them back to D.C. Meanwhile, a mole, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) is allowing supporters of Radek on the plane, disguised as journalists. The terrorists help themselves to guns used by the Secret Service and hijack the plane. Their terms? The main man, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) wants the the release Radek from prison or one hostage will be killed every half hour.The Secret Service has managed to get the President into a pod and release it from the plane. But the President didn't leave. From the downstairs area, he makes trouble for the hostages, who believe that it's a Secret Service man. The President, a former soldier, has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.Thrilling movie with great effects. Glenn Close plays the Vice President, and Bill Macy is part of the President's team. For some trivia, the little girl who plays the daughter, Liesel Matthews, is the Hyatt Hotel heiress and worth about $500 million today.I don't understand the point of watching a film like this and then itemizing all the unrealistic things about it. Movies like this are never realistic, so why not just enjoy them? And fantasize about tough, brave, loyal Harrison Ford as President James Marshall running the country.",Air Force One

13,sunwarrior13,Air Force One: A Great Ride Of An Action Thriller,9,26 December 2011,"In this action thriller,Air Force One,Harrison Ford plays James Marshall, a onetime combat hero in the Vietnam War who is now President of the United States. While visiting the former Soviet Union, Marshall gives a speech in which he supports a get-tough attitude against both terrorists and a right-wing general and war criminal from Kazakhstan imprisoned in Moscow, earning him few friends in the Eastern Bloc. While flying back to the United States aboard Air Force One, Marshall and his staff discover that one of the journalists returning with them is actually Ivan Korshunov, a Kazakhstani terrorist, who hijacks the plane with three associates and holds the president hostage -- with his wife and daughter on board. Marshall must use his strength and intelligence to keep the terrorists at bay and devise a plan to allow his family to escape to safety, while on the ground the vice-president, the secretary of defense, and the attorney general grapple over what to do and how much control to take in this crisis. Air Force One was characterized by a slam-bang action sequences and a story that is full of plot twists fly fast and furious in this nail- biter that provides great thrill and excitement as well as entertainment to the viewer. Aside from that,it also had brilliant performances from its lead star Harrison Ford,together with his supporting cast,Gary Oldman, and Glenn Close, together with Xander Berkeley, William H.

14,hitchcockthelegend,What arrogance to think you could ever understand my intentions.,7,9 May 2012,"Air Force One is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Andrew W. Marlowe. It stars Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Dean Stockwell, Xander Berkeley, William H. Macey and Paul Guilfoyle. Music is scored by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Michael Ballhaus.Russian terrorists have taken over Air Force One. The President, an ex-soldier, doesn't take the easy option of the escape pod and sets about saving his wife, daughter and reclaiming the plane.It made over $230 million in profit, it was, by definition, a typical action blockbuster, headed by one of the biggest stars of the day. Its reputation isn't great, those who look down their noses at the action genre, or summer blockbusters in general, gleefully do all they can to insist these are bad films for bad people! My response to that is simple, stay away then! I mean why would you watch this sort of film in the first place if you don't expect a ridiculous premise? It's Harrison Ford playing the Prez of the USA, dialling into Die Hard on a plane and kicking arse for God's sake. And boy is it fun.It's unashamedly American. An impassioned President speech about no negotiation with terrorists leads off the picture, and Jerry Goldsmith layers a big boom military influenced score over proceedings. Come the finale, where the inevitable happens and we throw every punch with Prez Harrison, feel his every emotion as the big decisions have to be made, you feel like standing to your feet and singing Star Spangled Banner: And I'm British! Quite an achievement considering it's directed by a German! Ultimately it's a great action film, with a bravado laden story at the core, even if the Cold War has been over for some time.......Ford is ace, always comfortable doing action, and here is no different even at age 55, and he's still one of the best punch throwers of his generation. Around him it's a roll call of professionalism, from the stoic Close as the Vice President on the ground, to Macey and Guilfoyle on the plane, it's all a bit by the numbers melodrama, but it's effective in letting Ford and a hopped up Oldman to take centre stage. Petersen's action sequences are not found wanting, they are real crowd pleasers, and the suspense and tension passages of play are well oiled by the wily director.Flaws? Loads, as there almost always in the big box office actioners, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. I mean the world's safest plane gets hijacked by terrorists, after that I would be disappointed if there wasn't daft stuff to follow! 7/10",Air Force One
15,Doylenf,Combat in the sky...on Air Force One no less...,6,12 September 2006,"As action thrillers, go, AIR FORCE ONE has enough of a plot to keep you watching closely as terrorists take over the presidential plane, a sleek beauty of a craft that makes a gleaming set piece for this kind of adventure in the sky. And who is better qualified to take care of things than HARRISON FORD, somewhat less impressive without that hat and familiar stubble as Indiana Jones. (Well, maybe KEVIN COSTNER who was originally slated for the role).GLENN CLOSE makes a very commanding presence as the Vice President, seemingly never at a loss in moments of distress, and GARY OLDMAN handles his Russian accent and menacing villainy with his usual aplomb. It's just that if you stop long enough to take a breath while all the action is going on, you might see that underneath all the fancy pinnings this is regulation stuff that's been time countless times before--and sometimes with better results.The cast is impressive with WILLIAM H. MACY and DEAN STOCKWELL on the prez's team and Jerry Goldsmith providing another one of his dependable, if unmemorable, action scores.And although Wolfgang Petersen does a nifty job of directing, turning the president of the U.S. into an action hero performing stunts that seasoned stuntmen must have been hired for, does stretch credibility a good deal for the climactic moments when airborne peril is at the max for a cliffhanger ending.Not bad as an action thriller, but just don't expect it to be any more substantial than a sleek new video game.",Air Force One

The plot is ridiculous - Air Force One is hijacked by a group of highly trained terrorists led by Gary Oldman, who quite easily commandeer the plane and hold the President hostage - except, that is, that he too is an extremely highly trained man who dupes them into thinking he has been ejected in a life pod. Soon we have a cunning Mexican stand-off at 35,000 feet with just about everyone else being a casualty. Thank heavens for the sanity of VP Glenn Close holding things together on the ground while our airborne adversaries battle it out. It's probably fair to say that the CGI has been at the drink, too - it is all over the place at times.

17,poolandrews,Decent 90's action flick.,7,7 May 2008,"Air Force One starts in Russia three months after General Ivan Radek (Jürgen Prochnow) the self proclaimed military leader of Kashakstan has been captured by American & Russian forces, the president of the United States James Marshall (Harrison Ford) & the Russian president Petrov (Alan Woolf) speak to the worlds media & affirm their tough stance on terrorism & terrorists. Afterwards Marshall & his people head back to his plane Air Force One & take off. Shortly into the flight General Radek loyalist & terrorist Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) & his men hijack Air Force One & take complete control of it, Marshall makes it down to the baggage compartment & the escape pod which he ejects. Korshunov thinks he has lost the president but Marshall is still on board & is determined to save his family, the other passengers & not give in to Korshunov or his demands...This American German co-production was co-produced & directed by Wolfgang Petersen & while it's not up there in the higher echelons of the big budget action film genre alongside the likes of Die Hard (1988), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) or Speed (1994) for instance it's an entertaining enough big budget action spectacle with which to pass a couple of hours. The script by Andrew W. Marlowe really rams home the all American hero plot with the president of the United States turning into an action star as he single handedly takes on a bunch of terrorists, it's all very patriotic & a bit sentimental as it tries to makes all you Americans out there feel a little bit better about your foreign policies & stance on terrorism. Air Force One repeatedly states that America & it's stance is right & everyone else is wrong. However take away some of the more questionable political aspects of Air Force One & we are left we a action packed thriller with a familiar hijacking plot but plenty of fights, shoot-outs, explosions & action to pass a couple of hours with the minimum of fuss. The character's are your usual cardboard cut-outs & clichés, the dialogue is functional & the pace does drag at times but if you like big budget Hollywood action flicks then I am sure you will like Air Force One.Director Petersen does alright, there are maybe a couple of plot holes like how did known terrorist Korshunov & his men get through the fingerprint security check at the start? There's some stuff about inside help but it's never really explained to any satisfactory degree & then there's setting all those explosives off on the plane which in reality would be a really bad idea. Then there's the secret service traitor, why does he just stand by while the terrorists plans go down the toilet? Why does he not try to rectify them? Why remain anonymous? It just seems weird that he would stand by & let all the plans that he was involved with go to waste, I just don't really get it. The action scenes are well handled but a little repetitive. There's a fair amount of violence & blood splatter. The final plane to plane mid air rescue is apparently an almost shot-for-shot copy of the same type of rescue in Airport 1975 (1974).With a supposed budget of about $85,000,000 Air Force One is well made with big budget Hollywood production values, some of the CGI computer effects look a little dated these days but they still suffice. The lead role was originally written for Kevin Costner but he did The Postman (1997) instead, big mistake Kevin big mistake. The acting is good, Harrison Ford makes for a decent all American hero, British actor Gary Oldman playing a Russian terrorist turned down the bad guy role in Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) to do this (good choice) & makes for a good villain while the likes of Glenn Close, Dean Stockwell, William H. Macy & Tom Everett having supporting roles.Air Force One (if they ever made a sequel would they call it Air Force One Two?) is a entertaining if ultimately somewhat shallow big budget action film set aboard a plane, to be honest I think Con Air (1997) is still the best hijacked plane action flick out there but this isn't too far behind.",Air Force One
18,zardoz-13,"""Air Force One"" is 'Air Force Fun!'",9,6 August 2009,"Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga ""Air Force One"" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains. Nevertheless, the parallels between Clinton and Marshall appear clearly obvious. Harrison Ford's President James Marshall is married to a tenacious, headstrong wife in the Hilary mode, and they have a 12-year old daughter. (So was Bill Pullman's president in ""Independence Day."") Unlike Clinton, President Marshall flew helicopter rescue missions in Vietnam and received a Medal of Honor. No, the filmmakers refuse to identify President James Marshall's party affiliation, which make ""Air Force One"" impartially political, while it trumpets America's anti-terrorist stance.Andrew W. Marlowe's melodramatic screenplay shows more agility than innovation. While his characters emerge as largely one-dimensional stick figures, the dimensions of their predicaments assume nothing less than cataclysmic proportions. Marlowe's script keeps Harrison Ford leaping through enough flaming hoops to fill three movies. Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel. Just about everything that can happen aboard ""Air Force One"" occurs. Presumably, with the recent spate of skyjacking movies, it was only a matter of time before Hollywood appropriated both Air Force One and the President as the pulp of their fictional escapade.The movie opens in slam-bang style with an elite American commando team parachuting into Kazakhstan at night. Using the latest hi-tech gear, they kill the palace guards and abduct an adversarial Russian leader, General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow of ""Das Boot""), who is promptly incarcerated in a Soviet hoosegow. Three weeks later in Moscow, President Marshall stipulates that the U.S. refuses to negotiate with terrorists. Meanwhile, a ruthless ultra-nationalist Radek zealot, Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman of ""True Romance""), succeeds in smuggling his bogus TV news crew aboard the most secure plane in the world. A disgruntled Secret Service agent, Gibbs (Xander Berkeley of ""L.A. Takedown""), as we later learn, helped these guys obtain their security clearance. Once the plane is airborne, Korshunov and his men commandeer it, kill the pilots, and watch helplessly s the president ejects in his escape pod. (Does anybody remember ""Escape from New York?"") Ivan contacts the Vice President (Glenn Close) and vows to kill a hostage every half-hour until Radek walks away from prison. According to Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), Radek's release would bring down the pro-American regime in the Kremlin and bring back the Cold War, so the Russians are reluctant to set him free unless President Marshall makes the request personally for Radek's release.The filmmakers cannibalize in typical Hollywood fashion every neat idea from all the other skyjacking thrillers. Generally, ""Air Force One"" follows the formula of the Kurt Russell hit ""Executive Decision."" Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry. You can tell that Marlow evidently watch the Wesley Snipes thriller ""Passenger 57"" for one scene. Another scene features a stunt that appeared in both ""Airport 75"" and ""Cliffhanger."" The president here imitates the action heroes from the Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" franchise and the Steven Seagal ""Under Siege"" movies. Finally, the ""Air Force One"" ending should come as no surprise to any ""Star Trek"" movie veterans. Anybody who thrives on movies like an insomniac will spot these plot elements. Although ""Air Force One"" borrows heavily from other epics, the staging of the action and some new scenes in the skyjacking formula boost this opus over the rough spots.Anybody familiar with German director Wolfgang Petersen will recognize the affinity between ""Air Force One"" and his earlier classic U-boat thriller ""Das Boot""/""The Boat"" (1981). The casting of ""Das Boot"" star Jurgen Prochnow as the heinous General Radek aids in this comparison. Moreover, Petersen sends his highly mobile and energetic cameras plunging about the corridors of ""Air Force One"" with the same dexterity that they swept through the hull of the sub in ""Das Boot."" Despite a connect-the-dots plot, Petersen makes every dot a fire storm of intensity. The scene where the President's jet careens wildly across the airfield in Germany and nearly crashes is pretty harrowing.Ford's presidential protagonist is basically Indiana Jones in a suit and tie. The filmmakers rely on Ford's action hero charisma to compensate for the lack of depth in his inadequately sketched head of state. Shrewdly, they shift gears to the parental side of the chief executive. Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game. Although Marshall emerges as a cardboard politician, it's his ""Die Hard"" courage that wreathes him with laurels. Unlike those wimpy Jack Ryan movies ""Patriot Games"" and ""A Clear and Present Danger,"" Harrison Ford's hero here kills the villains. The bad guys don't slip out of Marshall's clutches and conveniently impale themselves on sharp objects. (Remember the way the ""Patriot Games"" villain died?) Marshall runs up a body count, kills with a machine gun, snaps necks, and slugs it out with rough and tumble adversaries. Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy. Ford manages to maintain a stiff upper lip throughout ""Air Force One"" and his scenes with bad guy Gary Oldman crackle with electricity. Ultimately, however, Ford's performance qualifies as serviceable, nothing truly special like the cop the played in ""The Devil's Own"" (1997).The real casting coup in ""Air Force One"" is Glenn Close as Vice President Kathryn Bennett. Close manages to hold her own in a room packed with veteran male character actors like ""Quantum Leap's"" Dean Stockwell who constantly bullies Close to usurp presidential authority. Although certainly not the most original skyjacking melodrama, ""Air Force One"" manages to add elements to the formula and boasts enough visceral R-rated violence to keep you distracted throughout its 124-minute running time.",Air Force One

This time he runs around an airplane attempting to save his family and fellow passengers. The storyline is as developed as it can be, some of the stunts are definitely hokey.

20,Boba_Fett1138,Entertaining action non-sense.,7,12 September 2004,"The story is totally unbelievable and stupid but this is simply not a movie that is trying to be believable and smart, it's made to entertain and entertain it does!What is it with German directors making patriotic American movies? You have Roland Emmerich who made the patriotic movies ""Independence Day"" and ""The Patriot"" and you have Wolfgang Petersen who made this movie. Yes ""Air Force One"" is a patriotic movie, I mean the American president fighting a couple of terrorist, how more patriotic can it get. But is it a bad thing? In this case no, the patriotism really didn't bother me, since it is clear that this movie is just simple action non-sense that is not meant to be taking serious.I find it funny that many people call Gary Oldman the highlight of the movie. This movie might very well be Oldman's worst role till date. He played many villains before and he has done way better. Compared to his other roles this is a very average role for him, it almost feel like he is holding back. I think it says something about Oldman as an actor that people still love him in this movie. Harrison Ford acts a bit stiff in the beginning but once the action begins he seems to become more and more comfortable in his role and becomes a believable American president. I love both Xander Berkeley and William H. Macy, they are two of my favorite small part actors so it was fun for me to see them both in this movie. Jürgen Prochnow, best known for his role as the captain in Wolfgang Petersen's masterpiece ""Das Boot"" also plays a small part in this movie.Like I said, the story is total non-sense but still it is not made like it's totally unbelievable, which is I think thanks to Petersen's professional directing and it is the action that also doesn't disappoint.Another thing that also doesn't disappoint is the musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.(SPOILER) A thing that does disappoint is the ending when air force one crashes into the sea. It's very poorly made and it reminded me of a computer animation the always used to made in the 90's to reconstruct a plane crash and showed on the news. (END OF SPOILER)So as long as you don't take it all very serious, this is a very entertaining action movie.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Air Force One
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Pretty good, but not really anything special",7,12 July 2004,"Hollywood has made plenty of films by this one basic formula, ever since the popularity of Die Hard; put a heroic character in a confined space, let a bunch of terrorists take the confined space over, and have the heroic character kill the terrorists, one by one. Unfortunately, no movie has ever come close to the high quality of Die Hard, and this is no exception to that rule. It is, however, pretty good, and possibly one of the better that use that formula, as long as you ignore the glaringly obvious plot holes and factual errors that the film contains. Some of the dialog is also nearly cringe-worthy to listen to, and, like many others, I agree that the special effects near the end of the film look absolutely horrendous(though they look decent enough for the rest of the film). But, if you can look past all of this, you will probably enjoy the film, as it has some pretty good action scenes, and some decent one-liners. The plot is pretty good, and it does indeed present us with a rather interesting idea(Air Force One being taken over by hostiles), it also takes off reasonably quickly and has a good enough pace throughout the films duration. The acting is good, definitely one of the films high points; veterans such as Harrison Ford, Glenn Close and Gary Oldman were all great, even minor stars/characters as Xander Berkeley and William H. Macy do a good job portraying their respective characters. I also think Liesel Matthews gave a surprisingly good performance, considering her age and her acting experience. The characters are fairly well-written and interesting, Gary Oldman as a villain is always good to see(check him out in The Fifth Element and Leon), and Ford is fairly believable as the president of USA. The action is fairly well-choreographed and intense. All in all, a pretty good Die Hard-like formula action film, but nothing special, really. I recommend it to fans of this sub-genre of action, and action fans in general. Also, it doesn't hurt to be a fan of one or more of the main actors, as they all give great performances that any fan of theirs should enjoy. 7/10",Air Force One
22,view_and_review,Our President is Tougher Than Yours,2,19 October 2020,"His movie was one big back slap. It was one long erotic stroke of the American ego. And I am American. President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) doesn't need the secret service, the secret service needs him. He did everything but diffuse a bomb at the last second.Air Force One is taken over by Russian terrorists with the head one being played by Gary Oldman. I like Gary Oldman and he did a good job, but the movie is dreck. This movie was pure propaganda wrapped in celluloid. I don't know if America's worldwide heavyweight ranking dropped in 1997 and it needed a boost, but ""Air Force One"" seemed like it was a reminder to all nations that you can't mess with us, even if you get to our president.President Marshall was supposed to have escaped Air Force One in an escape pod, but he refused to leave Air Force One as long as his wife and daughter were on board. Understandable. What he did next was of a questionable nature. He pretty much took out one armed terrorist after another using stealth, ingenuity, and his superior fighting skills. They made sure to do a little bit of exposition so that we knew he fought in Vietnam to cover the fact he was so brave and so skilled at handling firearms.As ruthless as Oldman was, we knew one thing for sure: he would not kill (or be able to kill) the first family or the president. It was all a matter of what heroics the elderly president would be able to pull off to save them. James Marshall may as well had been James Bond. Not only did he save everyone on board Air Force One, he defeated all of the bad guys. His strength, power, and principle would've been mesmerizing if it wasn't so repulsive. But what should we expect from an action movie titled ""Air Force One?""I am President Trump and I approve this message.",Air Force One
23,anaconda-40658,Air Head One.,1,8 August 2015,"Air Force One (1997): Dir: Wolfgang Peterson / Cast: Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Dean Stockwell: At long last Harrison Ford plays the President and he believes in a country of moral fiber. Boy, does he have high hopes. Terrorist attack Air Force One and it is believed that the President escaped by pod but he refuses to leave without his family. This means that he will take on the enemy at their own game until reaching a stupid beyond stupid climax that has the President duke it out with the head terrorist. Give me a break and a bloody Tylenol to help digest the crap this film dished out! Are the makers of this film that totally ignorant or do they just lack a sense of reality? I was waiting for Wolfgang Peterson to emerge the President in tights and a cape from a phone booth. This is one of the dumbest ideas of the year, and despite Gary Oldman's efforts as the villain, the role is still predictable. That means that the President will eat his spinach and grow super powers and kick his ass. Glenn Close does her best as Vice-President but fails to make us believe that she actually gives a sh*t. Is that not the phony agenda of this bullshit? Wendy Crewson as the First lady is as flat as an A cup bra. The film is an example of overspending and good actors who should have been cast in a better film. Film's purpose is to create the biggest Americanized peep show. Score: 1 / 10",Air Force One
24,AaronCapenBanner,What A President!,8,5 December 2013,"Wolfgang Petersen directed this exciting action-adventure tale that stars Harrison Ford as American President James Marshall, who has just given an historic speech in Moscow about terrorism when, en route home, terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov(played by Gary Oldman) hijack Air Force One(the President's plane) and threaten to kill the passengers one at a time until their demands are met. What they didn't count on was the resilience of the President, who takes up arms himself and battles the terrorists, determined to retake his plane. Thrilling, rousing film may have an unlikely premise that resembles ""Die Hard"", but is still handled with intelligence and skill, with fine performances and direction. We need more leaders like James Marshall!",Air Force One
25,FlashCallahan,Give a mouse a cookie....,8,22 August 2013,"The President goes to Moscow and gives a speech outlining the USA's new ""Zero- tolerance"" policy with respect to terrorism.

The terrorists plan to execute one hostage every half-hour until their demands are met. However, the President is Harrison Ford, a former Medal of Honour winner.....How can anyone hate this movie, if you suspend your disbelief for two hours and try to ignore the blatant patriotism? Its Die Hard on a plane (again), but with Harrison Ford as The President of The USA. The pitch must have been amazing. Its a no brainier. I cannot think of anyone better for the role, and the casting of Oldman is genius, because at the time, thanks to Leon, The Fifth Element, and True Romance, he was the go to guy for playing the villain, plus he's British, and we all know that Brits are the best Bad Guys (according to Hollywood).Yes it's a silly film, and the script is cringeworthy (get off my plane is worthy of Schwarzennegar), but the action is solid, Ford will never be better, and Oldman is brilliant, even thought there is one line he spouts in a cockney accent.And for a two hour movie, it goes at a hectic pace, even when we go through the old round the table stuff with the VP and Dean Stockwell looking serious, like you do in all these types of movies.Turn off your brains for a couple of hours, and you will be in for a treat...",Air Force One

What we have here are some terrorist from Russia I think (why are terrorist from countries that don't actually have gripes with us in the movies) taking over air force one with president and family in tow. Of course, the president does not get captured, but instead eludes the terrorist and complicates matters for them as he frees some of the hostages and instead of leaving himself stays to get his family back. The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys. Speaking of bad guys, Gary Oldman is pretty good here as the head bad guy, so is most of the cast of this flick. Harrison Ford is usually good in anything so he fits right in here and makes for a very heroic albeit unrealistic president.",Air Force One

28,SimonJack,Excellent action-thriller about terrorism hits close to home,9,18 September 2014,"""Air Force One"" is among the best and one of my favorite action-thriller films. Harrison Ford fits to a tee the image of a modern-day Errol Flynn. Of course the plots for these types of terrorist-criminal-action films are quite far-fetched. So to make them at all believable, the script writers have to find ingenious ways that such capers might be pulled off. And that makes for a lot of mystery and fun entertainment in the movie. The plot and script for this film are excellent, and all the cast play their roles very well. The cinematography, CGI and special effects are tops. ""Jurassic Park"" was the first film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide in 1993, and ""Titanic"" in 1997 was the first film to gross more than $2 billion in worldwide box office receipts. Only four other films that year grossed more $300 million, and ""Air Force One"" came in fifth at just over $300 million. I don't know if it was intended or not, but one aspect of the film clearly harkened back to a recent global event that was the shame of world leaders, including the U.S. and United Nations. This was a poignant scene in this film. Ford, as U.S. President James Marshall, attends a celebration banquet in Moscow. It is honoring him for his efforts to capture a former Soviet general who was now a tyrant dictator of a former satellite country, Kazakhstan. General Alexander Radek was a threat to freedom and world peace. Ford said he visited refugee camps that day, and he departed from his prepared speech. ""We were too late,"" he said. ""The Radek regime murdered over 200,000 men, women and children as we watched it on TV. We let it happen. People were being slaughtered for a year. We issued economic sanctions and hid behind the rhetoric of diplomacy. How dare we! The dead remember. Real peace is not just the absence of conflict, it's the presence of justice. Tonight I come to you with a pledge to change America's policy. Never again will I allow our political self- interest to deter us from doing what we know to be morally right.""The description in this scene had an uncanny resemblance to an actual event just three years earlier. The Rwanda genocide took place in 1994. Some 800,000 men, women and children were slaughtered by a majority ethnic group in that nation while the U.S. and United Nations looked on. The movie, ""Hotel Rwanda"" in 2004 is about that genocide. It portrays UN peace-keeping troops who are standing by as the carnage takes place in front of them. They were not permitted to use force to stop the killing. In one poignant scene in that film, we hear a radio broadcast in the background with U.S. President Bill Clinton talking about diplomatic efforts to try to stop the genocide. But the killing continued for nearly three months. The White House had known about the uprising before it started, but kept quiet about it to justify its inaction. Clinton later said that the failure of the U.S. to intervene in the genocide was one of his main foreign policy failures. In 2000, the UN explicitly stated that its reaction to the situation in Rwanda was a failure. Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan said ""The international community failed Rwanda and that must leave us always with a sense of bitter regret.""One must wonder about the state of terrorist activities in the world today. Will force be necessary to stop the killing and carnage? Will the U.S. president and other world leaders have the gumption to use force to stop the tyranny, to save thousands of lives, and to protect innocent people? As a world super power, does the U.S. have a moral duty to help protect our brother human beings in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and elsewhere? Today, whole cultures and ethnic groups are under attack and being killed in several nations around the world. But, so far, there seems to be little humanitarian interest among world leaders to use force if necessary to stop the carnage. So, we impose economic sanctions, and use diplomatic gestures while thousands of innocent children, women and men are being murdered or driven from their homes. Ford's talk in ""Air Force One"" was an inspiring moment that would make any American and most other people proud of being human. I'm glad that Hollywood at times can come up with social dialog that's so fitting for our times. It's too bad when the film industry sees the reality of the world, but our political leaders don't – or they don't have the courage and strength to act for the protection of the innocent. Will we learn from our past or not?",Air Force One
29,Mr-Fusion,Ford makes for a great president,6,29 March 2016,"""Air Force One"" comes packed with some considerable talent; not just the leads, but a wide array of well qualified supporting actors (and Jerry Goldsmith for good measure). That all of this talent is nearly blown on a story riddled with clichés is more than a little disappointing. This is a stock mid-'90s ""Die Hard"" clone (I mean, it's almost note-for-note), and it speaks volumes that Gary Oldman is wasted on an ill-defined character.But it's no secret that the movie's selling point is Harrison Ford kicking ass and turning the tables on the bad guys. And why wouldn't it be? Ford's got the believable ruggedness and it's always cool to see a take-charge commander-in-chief on the big screen. If this movie works, it's because of some of the action (the initial siege is pretty gripping) and because of its star. And some good flag-waving patriotism fits right in here, but as a whole, the movie also has a knack for overstaying its welcome. 6/10",Air Force One

31,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""The good guys are here!""",4,10 September 2007,"LOL, that just summed up the whole movie, didn't it? So last night I was looking for a movie to watch and in my mom's collection I found ""Air Force One"" and I noticed that Harrison Ford was in it, so I figured I would give it a look. So I watched it and all I can say is American Propaganda much? Now I'm all American, don't get me wrong, I love my country, but this was a bit much and incredibly insulting. If we really had a president like James Marshall, played by Ford, I'd say America would be a very exciting place of nothing but none-stop action. The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax. Oh, I loved the 25 endings of how they could keep the action going. Now I love action movies, don't get me wrong, but this story was just silly and unnecessary.President James Marshell is on the fight of stopping terrorism, Russian terrorism to be more specific. Well he boards his flight back to the states, Air Force One starts off well, but is quickly hijacked by Ivan Korshunov and his men, terrorists who want their General Radek released from prison in return for the passengers on board, which isn't good since I guess he was hard to capture and is a deadly terrorist. Ivan makes threats to kill of the passengers every half hour if the vice president does not meet his demands. But the President does not chicken out, he stays on board and will fight these terrorists and win back the plane.Air Force One is non-stop action with a mixture of the hit TV show West Wing. Like I said, I don't mind an action movie, sometimes I love the most cliché'd one's, but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism, but I think I'm speaking from a post 9/11 view, so maybe if I saw this movie a before then, I wouldn't have mind it that much, but even then, there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me, it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall, please, I wish. I can't wait to see President Bush on top of a tanker sporting a look like Rambo, but I guess I shouldn't hold my breath.4/10",Air Force One

35,sddavis63,It's A Bit Over The Top But It Has Lots Of Good Action,6,27 December 2010,"To state the obvious right off the top, I find it very hard to accept the basic premise of this movie: that Air Force One could be hijacked. However, it's an action movie, and how many of those are really believable anyway? So one has to judge this for its ability to excite and to entertain and every now and then to get your heart pumping. It manages to do all three of those things generally pretty well.Harrison Ford was an obvious choice to play the lead in this. As James Marshall, he's the President of the United States, who recently committed the US to ousting a brutal dictator in Kazakhstan and having him thrown into prison, whose followers commit themselves to getting him released by taking the President hostage. Ford portrays the action parts of this movie pretty well; somehow, when he was functioning as President away from the action scenes, I found him less convincing. Back in Washington there's uncertainty about whether the Vice President or the Secretary of Defense are in command of US troops given the president's ""incapacity"" - shades perhaps of Bush-Haig after the Reagan shooting of 1981. Glenn Close put on a solid performance as the Vice President.There's good excitement all the way through this. The setting of the plane is used to good effect. Air Force One being - well - Air Force One, it's not your typical plane. It has lots of office space and various other areas where one can hide, making the cat and mouse game the president plays with the hijackers pretty suspenseful. There was a very effective portrayal of the emotional turmoil the other hostages must have felt after the president was finally captured and was having the tar beaten out of him as they watched in growing discomfort. It perhaps went a bit too over the top at the end, with the rescue mission trying to get the president and others off the plane before it crashed. Perhaps the movie should have ended with the defeat of the hijackers and the movie shortened by 15 minutes or so. Still, it's pretty entertaining, and a wild high altitude ride.",Air Force One

In his trying to save his staff and wife and daughter by even going so far as negotiating with the terrorists on board the plane! As for the hard as a rock Gen. Radek he, or actor Jurgen Prochnow, played his part of the strong and silent type to the absolute tee. I can't remember one scene in the film that Gen. Radek was in where he as much as uttered one single word!",Air Force One

38,Robert_duder,A brilliant action flick with plenty of passion from the lead actors making it a stone cold must see classic!!,9,16 August 2008,"I remember seeing Air Force One for the first time in the theater. It was packed, so packed that I had to sit on the floor in the front of the theater and when Ford belts out his famous ""GET OFF MY PLANE"" the audience stood and applauded and cheered!! Kinda lame I think BUT it's pretty amazing when a film can reach an audience like that and literally make them jump out of their feet and although Air Force One has a lot going for it making it hands down one of my favorite action films the thing that gets through to the audience and to me is the amazing Harrison Ford. Still the entire film builds off of him and does so remarkably well. Director Wolfgang Petersen has had some definite hits and misses in his career but he knows how to tell a story with action and he proves it with this classic action packed thriller. Nearly the entire film takes place aboard Air Force One but you never feel like it's not enough scenery or action. It's actually non stop and the characters are so well developed in such a short time and the cast is so incredible both on their own merits and together that you are riveted to your seat the entire time. Still I think a huge chunk of the film like so many of his films rest entirely on the talent of Mr. Ford.Admittedly I am an enormous Harrison Ford fan as is most of the world considering he is one of, if not the, top money making actor in Hollywood. Ford plays beloved, too good to be true, strong willed (and therefore clearly democratic) President James Marshall (small joke.) Ford is just mind blowingly pure as the President although he makes some very controversial decisions in the course of the film (the cusp of them being letting a woman die to save and protect everyone else.) Still he is the kind of man you'd want in office but never get. On top of that he is strong and determined and a kick ass fighter. No one else could have played this role as well or as brilliantly. Equally as impressive is his nemesis in the film played by Gary Oldman. Oldman plays a brilliant madman determined to have his countries former leader released from Russian captivity. The two of them against each other is just mind blowingly perfect. Ford's character is one of the best action heroes in Hollywood history and Oldman's villain is right up there with him. Glenn Close gives a terrific performance as the Vice President who stands firmly beside the President at every turn. The rest of the cast don't get a lot of screen time but they are so important because the supporting cast is beyond impressive including Wendy Crewson and Liesel Matthews as the first lady and their daughter. William H. Macy (amazing as always), Dean Stockwell (also very impressive role for a small one), and Xander Berkeley as the Secret Service agent secretly turned rogue.From the moment the film begins to the moment the plane leaves the ground the action is non stop. The characters are all ones you come to care about and become involved in completely making the action all the more riveting and edge of your seat. Ford and Oldman give such passion to their performances as they almost always do and it draws you right in. If you love action films, if you love nail biters and thrillers and you haven't seen Air Force One you don't even know what the genre is!! I think one of the things that makes this so incredible is because this is the kind of President and the kind of staff and devotion and Government we could only dream of and the kind of respect for a President we haven't seen since the days of Roosevelt and Kennedy. Regardless this is one movie that anybody can enjoy for every reason imaginable and is a must have in your collection and a must see for everyone!! 9/10",Air Force One
39,bowmanblue,The greatest (fictional) President of all time,9,2 February 2015,"Harrison Ford plays... well, basically Harrison Ford, only he's President of America. And that's pretty believable. He's at his most charming all the way through the film – basically Han Solo crossed with Indiana Jones. It doesn't take much imagination to see how easily he was 'elected' into the White House. But of course the cons of being the most powerful man in the world means that people like Gary Oldman will try and slip on board your plane, take your family hostage and threaten to murder them unless he gets what he wants. In this case... some rogue dictator general needs freeing from prison, but that's by the by. All that matters is that President Ford (no, that's not his name, but I can't remember what it was) is on the loose aboard the presidential plane, Air Force One, and not too happy about the unwanted guests.When I first went to see Air Force One in the cinema, the film 'Die Hard' was at the back of my mind. In Die Hard, Bruce Willis had an entire skyscraper to hide in while he picked off the terrorists one by one. I did wonder whether a film about a man trying to hide in a plane (even Air Force One) would actually be believable. I was wrong. Don't think that just because the action centres on one (slightly smaller) location that it isn't brilliantly tense.It's an action film, so if you're into your tense stand-offs and shooting bad-guys, you should love this. There are plenty of decent enough characters, but it's Harrison Ford who carries the film on his own. Like I say, he's at his most charming and you can't help but root for him. And it's worth mentioning Gary Oldman, who, whereas Ford is at his most charming, Oldman revels in his evil-doings. There's no mistaking 'good' and 'bad' in this film.It's nearly two hours long, but it doesn't seem that way. Just like its simple setting, it has an equally simple plot and you don't really need to use too much brainpower to understand anything. But then that's its major selling point – it doesn't try to be anything other than a rocking action film. And, based on that, it succeeds.And, when Barrack Obama steps down, I really think Harrison Ford should take up the mantle.",Air Force One
40,g-bodyl,A Great Thriller!,10,28 September 2008,"Air Force One is a very good thriller. The action and suspense will be nothing to forget. This movie is about the President's plane, Air Force One being hijacked by Russian nationalists with the President on board. Now it's up to the President and the Vice-President to negotiate with the terrorists or the hostages will die. The acting in this film is pretty good. Harrison Ford did justice with his outstanding performance as the President. Gary Oldman is good as the evil terrorist. The music in this film is fabulous and patriotic considering that the score took two weeks by Jerry Goldmith to compose. I liked the effects in this film. There is nothing special, but for a film from 1997, this has good effects even though there are few. Overall, this is a good movie for everybody except for kids. This film is a moving picture with outstanding courage. My rating is 10/10.",Air Force One
41,cricketbat,Harrison Ford vs. Gary Oldman,7,13 January 2021,"There are two reasons that Air Force One succeeds: Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. Their performances alone keep this political action flick in the air. However, the decades haven't been kind to the visual effects-the exterior flying scenes look really cheesy now. Also, this film feels excessively violent. Nevertheless, I'd still vote to watch it again one day.",Air Force One
42,CuriosityKilledShawn,Air Force jONEs,8,22 July 2000,"Released in the UK in September of 1997, 16-year-old me saw this twice in a row, which is something I've never done before or since. I was to meet a friend at the cinema for a Saturday morning screening and he never showed up, so I sat there alone and annoyed. When it was all over he was in the lobby and excited to see it, not knowing that he got the times wrong and that I had already seen it. I could hardly let him down.Air Force One was a big hit for Harrison Ford, earning $173,000,000 on release ($278,000,000 in 2020 money) and making him one of the best movie Presidents ever (tying with Thomas Whitmore and President Camacho) and proving, at 55, he was still capable of action and was far from slowing down in, what was then, his post-Indy career.Using the Die Hard formula, which was over-abundantly popular at the time, the movie has President James Marshall under siege (!) on his custom 747 (specifically a Boeing VC-25) when communist nutjobs loyal to a recently captured General overpower the Secret Service and hijack the plane. Their goal is to pressure the US into releasing General Raddick, weaken the democratically elected Russian government, and bring back the Red rule with an iron fist (and hammer and sickle).It's a highly exciting film and brilliantly done, but I do have some problems that just don't lessen with each viewing. Though it was apparently written for Kevin Costner (who passed, reluctantly) it feels like a script written in the 1970s for Charlton Heston. I think a final script revision by a different writer would have done the film a lot of favors as some of the dialogue feels very cookie cutter and predictable. Also, Wendy Crewson, who seemed to make a career out of playing ""the wife and mother"" is really terrible as the First Lady and she comes across as a horrible character, which probably wasn't in the writing.While Gary Oldman is terrific as lead hijacker Ivan Korshunov I've never really liked him as an actor as there is just something naturally creepy and weird about his facial structure. Regardless, he is super evil and menacing here.To it's significant credit, it's a fantastically edited film, some of the best editing I've ever seen, honestly. It was nominated for an Academy Award but lost to Titanic (as did everything that year). Jerry Goldsmith's score didn't get any Oscar nods though it really is one of the defining scores of his career. The eight-minute sequence when the hijackers take over the plane is truly a tour-de-force of breathtaking action. Amazing stuff indeed. It beggars belief that he only had two weeks to score this movie after Randy Newman's first score was (rightfully) rejected at the last minute. It does sound a lot like his theme to Star Trek: First Contact, but that's only a concern to musical pedants like me.It seems that they were hoping to get a PG-13 rating considering that there is only one F-bomb but the constant blood splatters and intensity meant that a solid R was as good as it was going to get. And yet it was still a big hit, proving that American audiences feel very strongly about their President, fictional or real, and movies where America saves the day will always pull in the crowds and have the audience cheering (unless you're Independence Day 2).Cringy script problems aside, this is still a nail-biting action movie filled with suspense and tension. If you are a fan of the similar Executive Decision (also scored by Goldsmith) then you'll love this. Exec Dec is still the better film but AFO has an aesthetic edge with its nighttime setting being more atmospheric than the ""chasing the sunset"" color schemes of Exec Dec (which are still nice).Oddly, this movie features FIVE bad guys from the Beverly Hills Cop series in various roles. Make a game out of it and try to spot them.",Air Force One
43,ironhorse_iv,"This motion picture takes flight! Is it worth watching? Yes, it's an entertaining movie! It's my wingman.",7,21 November 2019,"Made in the aftermath of the Cold War & pre 9/11 world, director Wolfgang Petersen's ""Die Hard"" inspired thriller 'Air Force One' indeed flew high with both audience members & critics. Most of them like the motion picture about a U.S president James Marshall (Harrison Ford) attempt to retake his plane after a group of terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) hijack it. I can see why, as most of the action pieces were truly enjoyable. For example, the shoot outs and brawling stunt work were choreography very well even if the opening palace storming scene backdrop certainly didn't look like it took place in Kazakhstan, but in Cleveland, Ohio. Despite that, you can tell a lot of hard work went into the action; as Ford himself did most of his own stunts. He really did take some stiff punches from Gary Oldman. Besides his character's very important title, he look believable as the regular everyman forced into surreal situations to rise to heroism. While, yes, the Commander in Chief in this film had some value past military training. His present middle aged body was not bulked up to take the punishment. He got tired, hurt and damage as the film went on. There are parts in the film where he get easily capture or make a dumb decision or mistake. Because of that, Ford made for a great reluctant hero. It's just too bad that his character seem a bit one dimensional. After all, it seem like Ford was playing over righteous jingoism version of himself minus his flying skills. I can hardly remember anything much about James Marshall. If anything, the first time I saw this, I thought he was playing Jack Ryan again in another Tom Clancy adaptation. Regardless of that, some of the action scenes not involving much of him being presence were a little bit disappointing. After all, how in the hell does fighter jets not be able to shoot down a giant Boeing 747 out of the sky!? It's make no sense. To add to that some of plane explosions in the film look highly awkward dated and fake looking, especially the water landing. The idea that Air Force One has no automatic landing capability is silly. All Boeing 747s have the capability to land on auto pilot. It doesn't take an aviator genius to know that. Anyway, Major Caldwell (William H. Macy) does have the ability to fly it. After all, in order to gain his rank, he has to log at least 3,000 flight hours in an aircraft. So the whole third act escape seem a bit add on. Despite that, I did find the KC-10 Extender scene pretty cool to watch; along with the getaway from Ramstein Air Base even if the airplane being able to turn quickly with ease or fly up without flaps within a short distance was a bit unrealistic. It's non-existence like the real plane having an escape pod or parachute lift. Nevertheless all of these scenes are a lot better than the moments involving the Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close). I found the whole White House sequences to be irritating. All the 25th Amendment talk was too much. It made the film muddled with endless filler amount of unneeded political clicking & debate. It got so bad, I felt like I was watching CSPAN. They really made her look very weak by having her work with the terrorists' demands & being pushed around from U.S. Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell). At least, the filmmakers didn't have her breakdown and cry like the original script from Andrew Marlowe ask for. The film is already making women figureheads look disfavor enough by having the guys play with her emotions. Honestly the time spent with her should had been used to explain the mole reasons for betraying his crew. Without it, the whole heel turn seem very confusing. Its sucks because the premise of the movie is heavily tied to the geopolitics of the mid to late 90's. Yet the film didn't explore too much of his history. Nevertheless I did like how the other villain in the flick, Korshunov felt more fully dimensional than a standard stereotypical smug evil foreigner. Gary Oldman plays him as realistic human being to the hilt. He really got to shine at times. There are certain moments in the film where the terrorist brings up a pretty good point about US policies. In particular, how the president is also a killer. Although the somber and patriotic score quickly written in 12 days by composer Jerry Goldman did make the Commander in Chief actions seem more heroic than the villain. While, the soundtrack is beautiful to listen to, the film did force feed it down our throats to the point that the music came across as a bit extreme chauvinism for my taste. It got so bad that in 2016, Presidential candidate businessman Donald Trump use the music for his bid for the White House. Regardless, it's still a good soundtrack. A lot better than original composer Randy Newman's score for sure; which Newman reused for 2010 animation film 'Toy Story 3'. In the end, overall: 'Air Force One' truly is one of the most popular action films of the 1990s. It's one film worth flying over to go see. Highly recommended.",Air Force One
44,The-Sarkologist,Making the US President into an Action Hero,6,1 August 2011,"This is basically an action movie where somebody has hijacked Airforce One, the plane of the President of the United States of America, and a gung-ho hero, namely the president, must get it back. As a plot line it is quite basic, as an action movie it is good and I enjoyed it, as a piece of literature it is propaganda. This movie seems to give the point that America is strong and that they are the good guys. Capitalism is right and communism is wrong. The antagonists, led by Gary Oldman, are communists and they seek to reestablish Russia as a communist state. These communists are portrayed as blood thirsty terrorists that will not hesitate to bring women and children into the war. The Americans are portrayed as those who wish to stand up for peace and security and that everything they do is right. This movie also seems to be a message to the terrorists to remind them that there is no point in trying to hold American's hostage because they will not give in to their demands, nor will they win if they even try to. This movie also seems to reassure the American people that their government is strong and that if a hostage situation arises then they will be saved. Democracy is also given a boost in this movie. Basically they are also reassuring us that Democracy works and those whom we elect are actually calling the shots. There are numerous times that we are reminded that the President is the boss and that if he says something, even if his advisers do not like it, it will happen anyway. Independence Day is another movie where the President was a major character. Both times the President was an ex-combat veteran and both times he was a top notch fighter. We are left with the impression that the President of the United States is our hero and that with him holding the reins, everything is going to be fine.",Air Force One
45,filipemanuelneto,Too much American propaganda.,4,5 February 2017,"This action film focuses on the figure of the US president and his private airplane, Air Force One, which is abducted by politically motivated air pirates, willing to kill everything and everyone to liberate a dictator from Eastern Europe. Of course the film is a copious rain of US imperialist propaganda, with the US being the ""world police"" and champion of democracy. Despite all this, it is a good action movie, although there are already so many action movies on planes that ends up bringing nothing new other than the propaganda. The scenes in the presidential crisis cabinet are much more interesting than the scenes on the plane, with the several hesitations and fears of the presidential staff jumping into the public's eyes. These scenes greatly help the audience to get into the mood and get carried away by what they see. The end of the film lacks credibility and ends up implausible. Harrison Ford did a good job but reminds us a bit of other action movies where he shined, so it's not surprising. Gary Oldman did very well, almost stealing the scene from Harrison Ford. The worst of his interpretation is a fake Russian accent that makes the character a bit ridiculous. Glenn Close also does a good job, in a secondary character that ends up having some centrality in the plot. All the rest, unfortunately, is US self-praise.",Air Force One

Aside from the way Andrew Marlowe wrote the character of James Marshall, Harrison Ford portrays this president with a level of honor and dignity this country has not seen in many, many years. It moves me and touches my patriot heart in ways most other flag-waving flicks can only hope to do.This story is riveting and action-filled, while retaining its quality of a story-driven work with honest and believable dialog. Wolfgang Peterson is a talented director, and his gift shows herein. The element of humanity one finds in the overall execution of the work is inspiring, to say the least. The overall style is not slick, it is gritty. The sentiment is not polished, it is raw. The humanity is not made for public viewing, it is meant for personal consumption...for we are people. Do I sound dramatic? Perhaps because this movie affects me in a way that IS dramatic. I want a James Marshallesque president. Oh yes. I do.This is not for casual viewing...at least not for people like me.

52,smatysia,Good show in spite of plot.,7,1 June 2000,"It's really hard to rate this movie. Most of the cast were outstanding in their roles. (Note: Isn't it a shame that people playing the president these days, e.g. Ford, Martin Sheen, etc. have ten times the dignity that the actual president has?) Harrison Ford is such a likeable action hero, so much more so than Willis, or Jean-Claude Seagall. Even as the president, he projects a ""regular guy"" sort of aura. Glenn Close as the vice president played it with the proper gravitas. Gary Oldman just oozed evil. Others who deserve praise include Wendy Crewson, Donna Bullock, and William H. Macy.
I was going to say that the film had excellent production values, but I'll have to qualify that. All the scenes on the plane looked great, but all of the external flying shots were all too obvious computer graphics. Saved a lot of money, I'm sure, but this really detracted from the movie.

53,jimbo-53-186511,Air Force One - the toughest plane in the world!!!,6,24 October 2015,"Following a 'zero tolerance' speech, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) boards Air Force One with his family and security team. However, a group of terrorists led by Ivor Korshunov (Gary Oldman) manage to gain access to Air Force One under the guise of being a group of news reporters. Shortly after the plane takes off the terrorists reveal themselves and threaten to kill one hostage every 30 minutes unless their general is released from prison. The terrorists believe that the President has escaped from the plane in his pod, but Marshall is still on board the plane and is determined to stop the terrorists.My gut instinct was telling me that Air Force One was going to be one of those films that was ridiculous, but very entertaining. To its credit that is exactly what it is so in some ways I feel like I'm being a little bit harsh criticising it. However, in order to properly evaluate the film I'll give you some examples of some of the issues that I had with this film....Air Force One is definitely a film that requires lots of suspension of disbelief. The scene where a missile hits the back of Air Force One and puts a nice little circular hole in it was particularly unrealistic - considering missiles are used to shoot planes down you would have expected there to be more damage to the plane than what is show here. In the real world, I'm almost certain this would have caused the plane to crash. However, not only does this not cause Air Force One to crash, but a hit at the back also fails to damage the rear ramp and tail fin and the plane is also able to maintain the same course as a result of a hit from a missile??? Come on!!!! There is an additional continuity error later in the film where you can see that there is no hole or damage to the rear of the plane after the missile has hit, unless Air Force One is capable of repairing itself mid-flight.I got the impression that director Wolfgang Peterson was hoping that the fast-paced action and the frantic set-pieces would cover up any of these mistakes, but anyone paying any sort of attention will see these examples of incompetency. The CGI crash-landing at the end was beyond embarrassing - I'm pretty sure a plane wouldn't cartwheel after hitting the ocean??? Some of the plot elements themselves are also a little far-fetched; we learn that terrorists have managed to get a load of weapons on board Air Force One and we learn that someone has helped them, but even with someone helping the terrorists I still found it hard to comprehend how all the weaponry was moved on to the plane without anyone noticing?? it's an issue that's addressed in the film, but one that is never really clarified.The political angle employed in Air Force One made it quite an interesting film. I got the impression that the writers were trying to give the film some depth so that it doesn't appear to be just another dumb action film. That's all well and good, but the politics in Air Force One are a tad heavy-handed - how many times do we have to hear 'America does NOT negotiate with terrorists'. Rather than merely making this point, it felt like this point was being bashed round my head.I've given Air Force One a lot of stick, but to its credit it is very entertaining and I must admit 2 hours passed by very quickly. Peterson directs the film with a sense of urgency and the film does have quite a claustrophobic feel to it. I also liked the cat and mouse antics that are employed throughout the film. The writers also paint the President as a Vietnam war hero medal of honour and all so it's very easy to get behind him and when watching it you do hope that he will save the day which inevitably he does. Air Force One is definitely worth watching as it is very entertaining and for the most part it moves along at a fair old lick - although the final 30 minutes are a little drawn out. If you switch your brain off and just go along for the ride then there is plenty to enjoy here.",Air Force One

Any true veteran knows that!! This movie portrays the president how we want him to be, courageous, HONEST, intelligent, caring and above all a TRUE patriot!!! True patriots aren't draft Dodgers!!!!!!!!!!",Air Force One
58,davispittman,Entertaining 90s action packed ride,8,9 April 2017,"Air Force One (1997) is mostly an action packed fun ride. It stars Harrison Ford, Wendy crewson, Gary Oldman, Glenn close, and William H. Macy. The performances are well done. I enjoyed seeing Harrison Ford not only kiss terrorist ass, but also be a great family man and brave president. Wendy Crewson was good in her role as First Lady of the United States, she had some very emotional deep scenes that she handled with great skill. But out of everyone, Gary Oldman was hands down the best performance in this film. I absolutely loved his evil performance in this film, he was able to play this unbelievably evil terrorist so realistically and you never once doubted that he would follow through the atrocities he was saying he would commit if his demands were not meet. And then we have the Vice President of the United States, Glenn Close. Her performance wasn't quite to the level of Gary Oldman's, but I still really liked her in this character of hers. She came across as true to her values, tough as nails, and willing to do anything to keep her commander in chief, the first family, and everyone aboard Air Force Once safe. The action sequences are done very well, the script has a good pace to it and it's deep in sentiment and really makes you care about these characters in peril. 8/10 for Air Force One!",Air Force One

61,gcd70,Thoroughly enjoyable throw away fodder,8,4 July 2008,"Thoroughly enjoyable throw away fodder that doesn't stand up to intense scrutiny after the fact.Director Wolfgang Petersen does very well with what is a flawed flick of predictable outcomes and highly unlikely scenarios. Mister Petersen milks every tense scene for all the nerve jangling it can deliver, and turns each action sequence into an exciting, edge of the seat thriller. Visual and sound effects teams back the director up well, and Jerry Goldsmith's rousing, heroic score is a real plus. Editing is also a big positive.Although the theme of the good old Americans versus the bad old Russians is getting tired, the cast all do well to involve the audience in this high adrenalin pic. Ford is convincing as tough President James Marshall, and Gary Oldman comfortably adds another villain to his list. While the pair are consummate professionals, some fresh faces might have been good. Glenn Close gets little to do as Madam Vice President and William H. Macy's talents are largely wasted on his meagre role. Also stars Dean Stockwell.Cast, crew and director make ""Air Force One"" a flight not to be missed.Saturday, November 15, 1997 - Knox District Centre",Air Force One

Now, to be fair, it's not amazing or anything. This isn't a perfect movie but it's so watchable and enjoyable. This is a great movie to just toss on and enjoy the ride. Ford is a compelling on screen president and absolutely worth watching him yell at people to get off his plane. Then there's Oldman and his crazy Russian accent that is probably offensive but it so perfect in a cartoon villain way that I just dig it.Again, not a great movie but it's a super fun watch. Easy for background noise or for those with an action jones they need to satisfy.",Air Force One
63,Samiam3,"It takes off, but goes nowhere",5,13 October 2019,"Air Force One is what you get when you put Executive Decision and Die Hard in a blender and hit mix. The product would taste better if it had more of Executive Decision's subtlety and Die Hard's suspense.Harrison Ford is the president fighting to re take the Air Force One 747 from the hands of Russian terrorists led by Gary Oldman. There are 50 hostages on board, including the first lady and daughter, who (of course) end up with a priority seat away from the others next to Oldman on the flight deck. I might add that this particular flight deck has so many colourful switchboards and avionics that you would swear you were on a spacecraft. This is one of many examples of the way that Air Force One is too distracting to get emerged in. Another example is the blaring and overwhelmingly brassy score which never seems to let up.
Then there is Gary Oldman as the terrorist leader, who does less with an entire molonogue than David Suchet (Executive Decision) was able to do with a single glare.As for Harrison Ford, He seems to do better as the president than as an action hero. He gives a good banquet speech early in the movie, but once he is forced to pick up a machine gun, he seems so rusty and poorly coordinated. His character is a former marine and 'Nam veteran, so says one member of his cabinet to another, (purely for the audiences sake). Based on his performance, you'd think otherwise. Doesn't he know that it's dangerous to engage or institute open fire with machine guns in a pressurized plane at 30,000 feet. the fact that the bad guys do it is always forgivable, because they are supposed to be idiots.When the good guys win the day, everyone in the White House erupts into an unconvincing unprofessional mass of cheers as if it were superbowl night, accompanied by a comically unneeded swirling camera.

64,screenman,More Trouble On t'Plane.,7,3 August 2008,"Crikey, them terrorists never let up. Only the previous year they hijacked a jumbo jet, somehow managed to smuggle a fork-lift-pallet sized bomb on board, and a small arsenal of handguns and machine guns.That was 'Executive Decision', starring Steven Segal and Kurt Russell. This time, they manage to hijack the American president's own private jet, Airforce One. Harrison Ford plays the President-with-attitude, and it takes an actor of his gravitas to make such hokum watchable. I stress 'watchable' not believable. Ford heads an excellent cast in what is a classic Hollywood thriller. There's twists and tension all the way as an apparently missing president does the Steven Segal/Bruce Willis thing on the plane. Once again the baddies want some imprisoned bloke (played by Jurgen Procknow) set free. They're eastern Europeans this time.Eventually, the president is caught and it becomes one of those tiresome, mawkish 'family' issues. Like 'Executive Decision' it grows increasingly implausible towards the end. It has its moments, but is not as good. And it is never believable.It's so ironic that with so much carefully-crafted aerial espionage in the movies, no alarm-bells were set ringing elsewhere. Why wasn't 9/11 ever anticipated? Did Hollywood have to make a movie about hijacked jets being crashed into building before pentagon pen-pushers and Langley loafers finally took their feet off the desks and did what they were paid to do?And can anybody imagine any president or political leader doing the heroic thing? I don't think so. In fact that's about the most unbelievable element of all! 'Executive decision' has the edge over this movie. It is as tense, as well made, as well acted, scripted, and has as stellar a cast. Where it scores over this one is in sheer believability. But if you can get your head round the hokum, this is still a very adequate thriller.",Air Force One

Here I got all in one: breathtaking, gripping, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat entertainment and some good jokes from Harrison Ford. He was very cool and also Gary Oldman delivered perhaps one of his best performances in his career. What I liked the most was the cat and mouse play on the president's air plane. Then also the special effects were not bad and the soundtrack was well synchronized to each scene. Last but not least I thank very much the director Wolfgang Petersen for this great work.

67,Terryfan,Air Force One is pure 90s action,8,13 July 2015,"Air Force One is one of the biggest films of the 1990s and for good reason. It features everything that made the 90s a great decade for motion pictures. Air Force One would be one of those films that help made the 90s something special in terms of how a action movie is suppose to be. With a strong cast that stars Harrison Ford as the film protagonist President James Marshall. It's easy to stand that James Marshall is the best fictional president and with Harrison's performance it is easy to see why because he play such a strong character in this film and gives new meaning to the term Man of action and that's exactly what this president does. While his family, played by Wendy Crewson as Grace Marshall and their daughter is played by Liesel MarshallGlenn Close plays Vice President Kathryn Bennett she shows to be just the woman for the job and Glenn brings this character to life with her performance. Gary Oldman plays Ivan Korshunov the film main antagonist, Gary's performance is one of the most bone chilling and powerful performances of any villain in a film Gary turn it up high.The music in Air Force One is so well balance and it help move the story to bring it to life Jerry Goldsmith made a very good musical score in the film as each piece helps the filmThe plot is one of the most intense stories you can ever see in a movie and with the cast's Performance it helps make it convince as the thrill ride goes on.Do yourself a favor and watch this 1990s classic it is one of the best films of the decade I give Air Force One An 8 out of 10.",Air Force One
68,mjw2305,Good Solid Fun,7,4 February 2006,"An Action movie is made to entertain, and should always be taken at face value. With this in mind Air Force One hits the mark, despite some minor flaws it still delivers tension, drama and action in abundance.The cast is strong and full of believable characters, the story is compelling and the traditional dose of sentiment is added sparingly and to good effect. Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman both put in solid performances and they are well supported by the likes of Glenn Close and Wendy Crewson.Overall Air Force One is an safe bet for the average movie fan and should entertain most, without ever really excelling.7/10",Air Force One
69,sme_no_densetsu,A pretty decent Harrison Ford action vehicle,7,24 February 2017,"For a movie that recycles most of its ingredients from past action movies (especially ""Die Hard""), ""Air Force One"" still manages to stand out relatively well in its own right. This is partially due to the high concept premise that's chock full of potential.In the movie, a group of terrorists hijack Air Force One, which is the official call sign of the aircraft carrying the President of the United States of America. Luckily, the President just happens to be a tough-as-nails Medal of Honor recipient (rather than, say, a blowhard with a combover). Obviously, these terrorists are about to experience some major turbulence.Starring as the President is Harrison Ford. There aren't too many actors that could pull off this role but Ford is one of them. His pedigree as an action hero is unquestionable but he's also convincing as a stalwart leader and a loving husband & father. His worthy adversary is played by the always captivating Gary Oldman, who contributes a deliciously villainous performance. The supporting cast is headed by the formidable Glenn Close as the Vice President and is otherwise studded with the likes of Dean Stockwell, William H. Macy & Philip Baker Hall.As I alluded to above, the story borrows heavily from other (better) action movies, particularly ""Die Hard"". In fact, there are so many parallels that you could say that this movie is basically ""Die Hard"" on a plane, with the President in place of John McClane. That being said, the ""Die Hard"" template translates very well to the setting of ""Air Force One"". Unfortunately, in the later stages the action gets somewhat ludicrous, possibly in an attempt to distinguish the movie from other similar excursions.The sometimes over-the-top action isn't the only problem with the narrative, though. The catalyst for the story is a betrayal by one of the American Secret Service agents. However, director Wolfgang Peterson felt that it was unnecessary to provide a glimpse into this character's motivation, so he ended up leaving an explanatory scene on the cutting room floor. This is particularly baffling since the character figures into the action fairly significantly but he basically remains a mystery.Generally, though, from a directorial standpoint, Wolfgang Peterson did a fine job. Before eventually going overboard, the movie is quite suspenseful. Unfortunately, another drawback of the excesses in the action department is that the special effects aren't quite convincing. At least the Jerry Goldsmith score provides a rousing backdrop even when the story goes off the rails.Ultimately, ""Air Force One"" is a decent action movie but one that loses its way in the late stages. Apart from the aforementioned misguided action sequences, the final showdown with the terrorists also leaves something to be desired. Even so, the movie's still worth watching since Ford & Oldman going head to head makes for compelling viewing for a large chunk of the movie's runtime.",Air Force One
70,IonicBreezeMachine,"Fun and thrilling, but also overlong, melodramatic, overly somber, and espouses some rhetoric that is ill advised in hindsight.",6,9 September 2021,"Following the successful joint Russian/U. S. op to capture the bloodthirsty despot of Kazakhstan, General Ivan Radek (Jürgen Prochnow), a celebration is held sometime later attended by United States President James Marsahll (Harrison Ford) and hosted by Russian President Petrov (Alan Woolf). President Marshall gives an off the cuff speech lamenting the inaction over Radek's regime that allowed the murder of Kazak citizens and makes it a point that this will never be allowed to be repeated and for any would be Radek equivalents their days are numbered. As President Marshall returns to Air Force One to go home, his staff continue to deal with the reactions to his ""be afraid"" speech, while Marshall's wife and daughter return from the Russian Ballet to join the flight home. Eventually however, a Radek loyalist (Gary Oldman) with the help of traitorous Secret Service Agent Gibbs (Xander Berkeley) manage to seize Air Force One hoping to use the passengers as hostages, including Marshall's wife and daughter, to negotiate the release of Radek. Marshall tricks the hijackers into thinking he's no longer on the plane and uses his knowledge of Air Force One to fight back and save the passengers and his family.Released in 1997, Air Force One marked director Wolfgang Petersen's third hit in a row following on from the back to back hits of In the Line of Fire and Outbreak. Originally written for and developed with the Kevin Costner, Costner had to turn down the role due to commitments on The Postman and personally offered the lead to Harrison Ford. The result was a massive success beating fellow hijacked airplane movie, Con Air, by nearly $100 million becoming the fifth highest grossing film for that year. In the year's since Air Force One hasn't had much staying power (save for the line ""Get off my plane!"") and for the most part is just another in a long line of Die Hard style action pictures that permeated the 90s, not that that's a bad thing mind you, but in terms of that subgenre I wouldn't say Air Force One reaches the same heights as some of its contemporaries.I'll just say this right off the bat: this is a ridiculous movie that treats itself with a level of solemn reverence that makes the viewing of some scenes unintentionally comical. From Harrison Ford's ""be afraid"" speech that argues for the same approach to foreign policy that gave us disasters like U. S. interventionism in Cuba, Vietnam, Iran, and too many others to count the rhetoric is pretty hard to swallow with a straight face especially nowadays with 20+ years of not one but two endless wars supposedly based on doing what's ""morally right"" with no clear end goal as to what that entails. When General Radek is captured in the opening of the movie no mention is made of what's going on in Kazakhstan like if anyone has taken his place or if there's splinter factions because the movie doesn't want to think about the ramifications of what it suggested and blissfully ignores them (save for a plot point involving some MiGs from a Kazak base still loyal to Radek but that's barely a footnote). While the other Summer's hijacked airplane movie, Con Air, may have been dumber and more flagrantly unrealistic, at least it didn't have an overly somber tone that put on airs it was a seriously/semi-seriously political thriller.The action in Air Force One is well done with Petersen giving a good sense of geography to Air Force One with each floor distinctly identifiable and a clear idea of where things and people are relative to one another. The hijacking scene where we see Radek and his men storm Air Force One from within is well choreographed and filled with tension as they take hostages and try to stop the President from escaping in his escape pod. Gary Oldman plays Egor Korshunov (who I don't think is identified by name in the movie, but I could be wrong) and is delightfully over the top as a hard core Soviet loyalist who's angered by the encroachment of westernization that his ""robbed his people of purpose"". It's a fun villain role even if it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but this was pretty par for the course for Gary Oldman in the 90s with him being the default ""bad guy"" thanks to Dracula and The Professional. Harrison Ford is just...okay, he's not sleep walking our anything but the character is such a flawless boy scout that the only thing he's missing is a red, white and blue shield to throw at enemies, but even though we don't get that we do get a wire cutting scene (standard package for 90s action thrillers) and of course with five colors to choose from and only needing to cut two, Marsahll of course gambles that the red, white, and blue wires are the ones he doesn't need to cut...I'm sure you can guess the rest. Then of course you have the scenes back in Washington D. C. with Glenn Close's Vice President and Marshall's cabinet discussing scenarios and where the buck stops in more grounded scenes that almost feel like a proto The West Wing which clash with the more outlandish action elements.Air Force One is entertaining, but it's also silly and ridiculous with a completely unearned air of seriousness. Gary Oldman's scenery chewing Soviet nationalist villain is an absolute hoot as the villain and the film is worth watching for his performance alone. The action is competently staged with Petersen establishing a good sense of spatial geography, but the script is filled with ham fisted dialogue that becomes unintentionally funny and asks the audience to buy a lot of silliness while keeping a straight face.",Air Force One

The hijackers hold all the passengers as hostages and took control of the aircraft as they demand that the president will give the Russian government permission to free their general. But the president isn't going to give up with out a fight.It's action, thrilling, and breathe taking all in one plane. I liked the way this film was made, designed, and believable. Harrison Ford gave a great performance as the President. Having him as the Nation's leader would be awesome, especially when he has a better way of dealing terrorists than George W. Bush does. Gary Oldman was also great as the lead of the terrorists, he should get a round of applause for portraying as an S.O.B.The special effects are super for only being 9 years old.

But you knew that going in. Air Force One is what it is, a typical big-budget Hollywood action thriller where the plot (such as it is) gets put on the back burner while a bunch of people get shot and a lot of things get blown up. This is not meant to be thought-provoking serious cinema. It's meant to be fun and in that it succeeds.As the movie begins President James Marshall, played by Harrison Ford, is flying home from Russia where he has just given a speech outlining America's policy of not negotiating with terrorists. And, oh sweet irony, his plane is immediately hijacked by terrorists. The hijackers, whose leader is played by the wonderfully sinister Gary Oldman, are Russians angling for the release of a political prisoner. So now President Marshall's no-negotiations policy will be put to the test. Does he stand firm or give in to the terrorists' demands to save himself and his family? Oh yes, his family. Because we simply must have a terrified wife and child on board to ratchet up the drama, no? Anyhow while other politicians (including Vice President...Glenn Close? Hey look, a female Vice President, aren't we progressive say the filmmakers) consider giving in to the terrorists' demands, President Marshall takes matters into his own hands. While he might be getting a little old for this, Ford is a reliable action hero and he does what he does best. And Oldman is a worthy foil for him although his over the top accent gets a little tiresome. Putting the accent aside, Oldman does an otherwise perfect job of playing the villain. Such a role could be quite clichéd but he pulls it off brilliantly. But it's really Ford's movie and he is up to the task. Air Force One is not meant to be taken all that seriously. Just sit back, enjoy the action, appreciate the fine performances of the two leads and this one will be worth your while.",Air Force One

Like any action film of the summer, you'll gladly let go of your grips with reality in favor of non-stop, grab-on-to-your-seat excitement. AIR FORCE ONE is one of the best action pictures of it's decade, and the best one of its year. I really liked Harrison Ford here, even in his later days. Gary Oldman acted like a really crazy madman in the film, but I think he was his role. The special-effects were great and Jerry Goldsmith provides a terrific and often grand action score. We clearly have Wolfgang Petersen to thank for making AIR FORCE ONE more thrilling than it might have. Petersen takes the familiar cat-and-mouse thriller, takes it to a secluded surroundings of a baggage deck and throws in white-knuckle thrills and dreadful tension (never has gunfire been so frightening) to stir his audience expectations.

75,Stampsfightclub,One of the best thrillers you will ever see,9,7 October 2008,"President James Marshall (Ford) is in danger when a group of Russian terrorists take control of Air Force One.Wolfgang Peterson (In the line of fire) delivers a fast and tense action thriller in which Harrison Ford (Star Wars) gives a good performance as President Marshall alongside a terrific act by Gary Oldman (Dracula) as the lead terrorist Ivan Korshunov.Ford and Oldman give good performances but the star of the show is Peterson whose action style of direction maintains the tension and delivers excitement and claustrophobia on all the right levels, as does the writing by Andrew Marlowe.The film gets off to the right start with a group of agents parachuting into General Radek's mansion and kidnapping him, laying down the tone for the plot to take full swing and after an inspirational speech by the President, the real action and intensity begin.Though perhaps predictable as to what will happen on the plane, there is still an intensity so high and exciting that you can't tear your eyes away as the stakes rise and the drama reaches boiling point.The narrative flows consistently and creates its own realism and conforms well to the action thriller genre. What is impressive is that the action and intensity never let up and the stakes just keep getting higher and higher until the ultimate climax, and even then it keeps going. Thankfully hardly any clichés get in the way to spoil it.Peterson's direction helps bring the action to life, but also the characters, and none more so than Oldman's Korshunov, who is a true joy to watch. Like Alan Rickman in Die Hard, Oldman masters the foreign accent and creates that essence of control and evil, matched well by Ford who delivers another exciting action character.Without these characters, the plot would not have been as exciting or intriguing, and is a credit to Ford and Oldman. Glenn Close (Dangerous Liaisons) also delivers a good character as the Vice President.If you find the thriller genre hard to digest in terms of realism, you can take comfort in the acting and the characters but ultimately, this is a top notch exciting thriller.",Air Force One

Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, and Glenn Close are the leads. Harrison Ford is the best in one of his most memorable roles playing as the President of the United States. Gary Oldman is fierce and superb as the lead Russian terrorist. Glenn Close is very fine as the Vice President as she acts so within her character consistently throughout. These star performances of Ford, Oldman and Close, elevate Air Force One into far greater heights than imaginable. Air Force One's a special film, as it delivers simplistic entertainment to a tee. It's not a thinker. They took out all the thinker parts for the better. Air Force One has an outstanding all-around production value as the effects are great. The directing lens is fairly poor, however, being too closely framed throughout. There's a significant deal of inauthenticity attached to the story line, largely in part how easily the terrorists infiltrate Air Force One and then precede to execute and carry out their evil plans without any real resistance, but it all works for the good as it allows for a really fine and I think fun, family adventure.Air Force One soars all the way up to a 7!",Air Force One

Marhshall's pledge is put to the test when on the way to the USA, Air Force One is hijacked by a group Radek's loyalists.This film is not cliché. Well not fully cliché, as some claim it to be. It is, on the other hand, structural. Predictable to a large degree like clichéd movies, but there is a key difference in that ""AFO"" isn't action movie junk. It's a solid action movie. Are there logic lapses? Yes. Is the ""realism"" not fully real? Yes. But is the film tense and entertaining? Yes.Many action films with politics in their plot tend to preach uber-patriotic junk - just watch ""The Delta Force"" with Chuck Norris. But here, due to well staged action scenes and more importantly characterization, namely of the villain which is where most films of this type fall on their face. Gary Oldman is a very good actor and many roles demonstrate this fact and ""AFO"" is no exception. He plays a Hollywood textbook villain, but he plays him like a villain should be played - villainously! He readily kills innocent people to get what he wants yet, interestingly, he isn't just shown as a monster. There is a scene where we find out that he is a father himself. Maybe it is not deep character study, but at least it is 3-D. Same goes with the hero of the movie, President of the United States James Marhsall. I am sure the right wing people in Washington had near orgasmic experiences when they saw a movie about a US president kicking terrorist butts, but there is more to it. Just a little more to make the film not cliché, but structured. There many familiar elements and themes, but they are shown well and it remains largely consistent throughout the film. And that's what this is - an action movie. Not political commentary. There are no painfully staged shots of the hero standing in front of the American flag and no long winded speeches about the greatness of America, though there is a ""Mother Russia"" speech, but hey the villain is a fanatic and that speech which reveals the villain's motivations is consistent with his action during the movie.With good tension and build up along with the intriguing premise and setting it has all that a good thriller movie should. --- 8/10Rated R for violence.

81,rebeljenn,action-packed,5,25 October 2005,"This action-packed film turns the president into an American hero, out-witting the 'bad guys'. Although it's a summer blockbuster, which are usually more miss than hit in my opinion, it succeeds in keeping interest and providing some action. Certainly not a classic, but it's a good romp in the clouds for a few dollars, if you can overlook the silliness of the film.This is just a typical Hollywood blockbuster with some big names and big events of what we all feared in our minds before the hijackers of September 11, 2001.5/10",Air Force One
82,RonellSowes,Ridiculous But Exceptable,5,31 October 2021,"In the years after Die Hard pretty much every other action movie was just a variation of it: in this case the President on Air Force One. To be clear, this movie is quite frankly ridiculous. From Gary Oldman's comically over the top villain to Harrison Ford as the morally fixed commando president and everything in between them you always know this is just supposed to be fun entertainment.But however silly Air Force One may be it's still in the realm of exceptibility, at least since it has Harrison Ford who shades over most of its problems.",Air Force One
83,grahamsj3,Not bad,7,20 November 2000,"The star of this film didn't shine too brightly; this was a so-so performance by Harrison Ford. However, the supporting cast was so good that they carried the film. Ford is cast as the US President who is returning from a visit to Russia. He has just publicly stated that the US will not deal with terrorists. Well, guess who is aboard Air Force One? Bingo! The terrorists, whose leader is superbly played by Gary Oldman, take over the plane in a bloodbath. The remaining passengers are all taken hostage with the usual ""we'll kill one every hour until our demands are met"" conditions. Meanwhile, they missed the President, whom they think has escaped. Well, he didn't and now the President alone is left to save the day (and the hostages). Glenn Close as the VEEP puts in a very creditable performance, as does Wendy Crewson as the First Lady and Liesel Matthews as the Prez's daughter. A good yarn, stretching credibility a bit (the scene at Ramstein!!!), but altogether not bad. I give it a 7 out of 10.",Air Force One
84,kuarinofu,What happened?,5,25 July 2020,"Wolfgang Petersen, the director of the cinematic and TV masterpiece 'Das Boot' delivers, ehm, I'm not even sure what.First of all, Air Force One looks like a late 80ties movie, but it's as late as 1997, which was very confusing.I enjoyed the little touches, however, like having many ex-USSR actors like Levani (who was also in The X-files), Elya Baskin, David Vadim (who is also Ukrainian as I am), and overall having a cast full of recognizable faces, like Xander Berkeley from T2, William H. Macy from Fargo, Jurgen Prochnow from Das Boot, Dean Stockwell from many films including the classic Quantum Leap.The first act was promising but a little generic. Maybe it felt different for the time but watching this in 2020 packs no surprises. The film packs a lot of side plot lines only one of which was interesting - the non-negotiation policy and the problem of choice when it becomes personal. Everything else was either mishandled (like the traitor plotline) or turned into a complete comedy (like the ending dog fight segment).The first time when the film put patriotic propaganda in my face I got confused, then I thought they were satirizing something, but no, this was the real thing. Air Force One is just full of this stuff, the most simplistic national-patriotic you will ever see, including some laughably stupid actions from some of the characters.While the premise was not believable but plausible, after the second act we dive fully into some weird reality where the laws of our world do not apply. Not only physics are violated multiple times but also the way politics and negotiations work. It just becomes a complete schlocky mess. This might have worked as a summer blockbuster film at the time, but in 2020 it's just derived from reality cheesy film with surprisingly bad CGI (and that's two years before the Matrix).",Air Force One
85,eibon09,The Worst Film of Harrison Ford's Career,1,27 November 2000,"It was the most annoying and stupidest film that I saw in 1997.  I remember reading somewhere where Harrison Ford had stated about his dislike for the film, Blade Runner(1982).  Well, Air Force One(1997) is a lousy feature compared to that scifi classic.  Gary Oldman is average as the main villain. One reason I hate this movie is its Hollywood by the numbers approach and lack of any compelling characters.
It seems that Harrison Ford is trying to be John Wayne in his actions and this is the film's fatal mistake.  The role of the President was originally written for Kevin Costner who instead choose to do The Postman(1997).  I depised Air Force One(1997) so much that I was rooting for the villains to succeed.  Air Force One is a disgrace from a compatent director like Wolfgang Petersen who did better things like Das Boot(1981), The Neverending Story(1984), and In the Line of Fire(1993).  Glenn Close is the only actor who gives an interesting performance in the movie.",Air Force One
86,timdalton007,A Fine Action/Thriller,8,26 May 2009,"Having gone digging through an old box of my VHS tapes the other day I came across this 1997 movie. I remember receiving this as a Christmas gift when I was around fourteen and I enjoyed then but wondered how well it might hold up now that I was older. The answer, surprisingly enough, was rather well.For one thing it has a good cast. Harrison Ford makes the potentially unbelievable role of President/action hero seem believable. Ford handles the action sequences well and helps get the action hero side of the equation seem real. Ford then brings some acting talent forward as well as he comes across believably as the President of the united States in scenes like his introduction/speech in Moscow towards the beginning of the film. Even more intriguing (and rare in a Hollywood action film) Ford plays the personal side of the action hero President just as well. In short Ford gives a believable and well-rounded performance.Gary Oldman makes a fantastic villain in the form of Ivan Korshunov. It can be easy for an actor to take a role like Ivan Korshunov and turn into a cliché part but not Oldman. Oldman's performance seems real and becomes a study in a fanatical terrorist. This is especially true in Oldman's performance when he first calls the Situation Room and when talking to the President's daughter. Oldman also handles the action sequences believably and there isn't a moment where he seems unbelievable. In short Oldman gives a fine performance in what could have been a cliché ridden role.The supporting cast is good too. Of particular mention is Glenn Close as the Vice President, Wendy Crewson and young Liesel Matthews as the First Family who (like Ford and Oldman) take potentially clichéd roles and make them into nice performances. Noted character actors including Paul Guilfoyle, Xander Berkeley, William H. Macy and Dean Stockwell all give good performances in their various roles. There's also a nice non-speaking, cameo like role for Jürgen Prochnow as General Radek. There's also some good performances from numerous other actors that help to fill out the world of the film.Air Force One is an action film and does well at it. From the opening commando raid to the takeover to the plane and beyond, the film features some well-choreographed sequences. Not to mention numerous fight scenes including the climatic and highly impressive fight between the film's two leads. The film also features some exciting if at times unbelievable aerial sequences as well though some of the CGI work is rather unconvincing (particualry in the ending). Otherwise it's as impressive as any action film out there if not better.The film also features good work behind the camera as well. It features rather convincing sets from Production Designer William Sandell which (more then anything else) help to sell the reality of the film. The camera work of Michael Ballhaus gives Air Force One much the same claustrophobic feel of director Wolfgang Peterson's 1981 classic Das Boot despite the plane being much bigger which, when coupled with the editing of Richard Francis-Bruce, gives the film the feeling of being both a claustrophobic thriller and an action film all in one. Last, but not least, the script by writer Andrew W. Marlowe is fairly good though it does feature some glaring plot holes yet it works for the most part.All together under the direction of Wolfgang Pterson the result is a movie considerably better then most of the stuff that Hollywood produces on a regular basis.One of the film's highlights is the score. Unhappy with the score originally created by prolific composer Randy Newman, director Peterson turned to one of the true masters of film score Jerry Goldsmith. What Goldsmith (with the assistance of Joel McNeely) is truly up to the standards of Goldsmith's previous cores. it is loud, epic, personal, epic and patriotic all in the film's two hour running time. Goldsmith was great at creating themes which were not only memorable but fitting and his main title theme for Air Force One remains one of the great examples of his talent. it might not be the greatest score of Goldsmith's long career but it is certainly one of his best.All in all Air Force One is better then a lot of Hollywood's other action films. It is much better acted, better made, better scored and (if nothing else) better directed then the vast majority of the films in the genre of the big-budget Hollywood action film. As a film that is now twelve years old it stands up as not only of the better action films of the 1990's but as a fine one even today.",Air Force One
87,ctomvelu-1,Badfly dated,6,25 January 2009,"If it weren't for Harrison Ford, I can't imagine anyone wanting to look at this ultra-expensive cheesoid epic about (white) terrorists taking over Air Force One. This DIE HARD in the sky has the added gimmick of the Bruce Willis character being a two-fisted U.S. president. Gary Oldmanb is the laughable and unconvincing head bad guy. Glen Close plays the vice president (!) as if she were appearing on Saturday NIGHT LIVE or MADTV. The dialogue is atrocious throughout. There are certainly some exciting special effects scenes, including a runaway jetliner, but looking at this 1997 movie today should make any serious movie lover wince.",Air Force One
88,moviesleuth2,Pure Adrenaline Rush!,9,28 February 2009,"Granted, the premise is not even remotely plausible, but then again, can you name an action movie that is realistic? I can't. By nature, action movies are over-the-top, but it's the director's job to make sure that the audience believes what is happening on screen is real. Peter Jackson did it for ""Lord of the Rings,"" and Wolfgang Peterson does it for ""Air Force One."" President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) has just announced that the United States will not negotiate with terrorists after capturing a renegade Kazakhstani general. He's soon going to find out just how far he is willing to go to keep his word after Air Force One is hijacked by a group of terrorists (led by Gary Oldman in a frightening performance) who want the general released.Harrison Ford has been hailed as one of the all-time favorite movie presidents, and rightly so. He makes Marshall into both a powerful man who does the right thing but also a family man. In what is arguably the film's most tense scene, he hides in horror while upstairs there is a tragedy going on that he cannot (logically) stop.While Ford is excellent as the heroic president-turned-action hero, the film is stolen from him by Gary Oldman. Ivan Korushnov, the lead terrorist is a dangerous, intelligent radical who has no moral boundaries. There is no ""line"" to be crossed; there is nothing he won't do to get what he wants. Oldman plays him with such intensity and villainy that he's absolutely terrifying. This is a villain you won't soon forget.In an action movie, the action sequences are the stars of the show, and ""Air Force One"" doesn't disappoint. They aren't merely impressive, they're spectacular. The film opens with a scene like something straight out of Rainbow Six, and after calming down for about twenty minutes, it goes full force into all-out action. The visuals are top-notch, including a mid-air battle that puts ""True Lies"" to shame.Credit must go to Wolfgang Peterson for crafting such a wild thrill ride. He works best in claustrophobic situations, and he makes good use out of the inside (and out) of a plane. The pacing is relentless; once the film starts it doesn't stop until the end. There's a lot going on, but by limiting his focus to the plane and the White House (where a helpless Vice President Glenn Close tries to avoid doing the inevitable), Peterson avoids confusion.""Air Force One"" isn't flawless, however. There's one spot where a cut was clearly made, and some of the dialogue could have been rewritten. As it is, ""Air Force One"" is a flight you won't want to miss (forgive the cliché).Interesting note: The studio (and Harrison Ford) tried to get a PG-13 rating for the film. After seeing it, I don't know who in the right mind could think that was even possible. The film is hyper-violent, and even the MPAA wouldn't sink THAT low (yet)...My rating: Rated R for Strong Violence and Language.",Air Force One

I'm not going to get involved into the political side of things regarding this movie, but as a pure standalone action movie, Air Force One was an entertaining one, only because of Harrison Ford. He carried this movie almost all alone, and that's what it felt like when you see this anyhow. Yes, this movie, Air Force One, had plenty of plot holes, but I don't think it warrants enough to spoil your enjoyment of this film. Basically, if you're into action movies, you would enjoy it otherwise you won't. One thing I do like about this move is the plane itself. It's suppose to be an Air Force One, and it looked like it was, and that was important otherwise the movie would've failed. It allows the characters, especially the central ones, to carry out whatever needed to be done in terms of the plot. Yes, I would still say it's a controversial film, but like I've already stated, I'm not going to bother to discuss the political side of things.

This movie is one heck of a ride. Harrison Ford gives one of the best performances of his career as one U.S. President not to mess with. There are also terrific performances turned in by Glenn Close as the Vice President who deals with the terrorist's demands, and Gary Oldman in a scary piece of acting as the lead terrorist. The other actors in the movie do a good job also. In addition to the performances, there are two other big elements that make ""Air Force One"" a great movie: the special effects and action scenes; and the presence of the plane itself. The action scenes are some of the best I've ever seen. And when we first see the plane from the inside, it looks as if were on a tour of the actual Air Force One itself and it's fascinating.

In the case of ""Air Force One"" however, the situation moves to the Air Force One aircraft, immediately presenting a unique setting and upping the stakes tremendously. The story's a little similar to ""Die Hard,"" in the sense that both movies feature one hero picking off bad guys with a number of clever tactics. But while ""Die Hard"" showed things going from bad to worse, ""Air Force One"" seems comprised of a number of minor victories that build up to a brilliant climax. The film overall feels like a victory as we watch the President retaking his own airplane; this in itself could be a hint at the American spirit of rebelling against tyranny.The movie is thoroughly entertaining as, like any good action movie, it presents one sequence of thrilling events after another, with each action causing a significant reaction. Combined with a number of shoot-outs and incredible dog-fighting scenes, the film is very tense and exciting all at once.The story is a simple one, almost no different than ""Die Hard"" or any similar action movie, but it is well-told with fairly well-developed characters. The political drama and the portrayal of the Air Force One plane seems realistic enough.Photography is very good and solid, the production value is good, the special effects are awesome and still great to look at. Harrison Ford makes for an awesome President, and Gary Oldman puts on a brilliant performance as the primary antagonist. The supporting cast is quite brilliant as well.

He has a family, he is someone's son and those facts make him that much more real.  Harrison Ford is great as the president.

98,roghache,Tense action thriller features a magnetic and heroic President,7,6 June 2006,"While not particularly believable, this is certainly an entertaining and suspenseful action thriller. The improbable tale revolves around the fictional U.S. President Marshall who is returning via Air Force One to the States after giving a speech in Moscow. After Russian hijackers seize the plane, they threaten to execute one hostage every half hour until their demands are met for release of a Russian terrorist, General Raddack. They believe the President himself has left the plane on an escape pod. However, he has stayed behind, hiding and employing various tactics to rescue his wife and daughter who are still aboard. A former soldier himself and Medal of Honour winner from the Vietnam War, he proves himself an adversary to be reckoned with.For me, this movie is all about two factors. First its setting aboard the Presidential jet Air Force One naturally engrosses the viewer. Everyone is captivated by the details of the Presidential airplane and the horrific prospect of a hijacking.Second, the magnetic Harrison Ford is perfect in the role of President Marshall, a compelling figure who is outraged at the seizure of his plane. This devoted family man is faced with the wrenching choice of giving in to terrorist demands or endangering the lives of his wife and daughter. He refuses to compromise but proves himself willing to undergo any risks involved in order to protect his family. Other stars include Gary Odman as the head Russian terrorist and Glenn Close as the Vice President.This exciting movie features suitably dramatic and patriotic musical scoring by the wonderfully talented late Jerry Goldsmith. My only complaints are the considerable violence as well as some profanity. However, it certainly has non stop action and tense drama to keep you on the edge of your seat.

I was really buzzing with it - I wasn't really familiar with the plot, so I didn't know that Harrison Ford was our feisty Prez. If you had read the ""trivia"", you'd know the role was written for Kevin Kostner, who - thank heavens! - was obligated for some other role. Can you see him in all that action? I suspect Ford insisted they stick to his established rep, and all that fighting was added to whatever the script said. Yeah, it could have just stated ""The Prez. does a lot of fighting"", and that would be just about all it needed. I would have been saying that while I was watching - I'm sure I would have had another opinion AFTER watching ""Air Force One"". I was so busy trying to keep-up with the action and what The Prez. was saying - does he EVER speak in normal tones? - I missed his whole speech and then switched-on the subtitles. Even though I wasn't truly understanding the plot till then, I knew it had to be something pretty serious after all that ""red-dot"" stuff. Clevvvvvvvver.Weren't you suspicious when the ""baddies"" had to be checked again before getting on the ""Force"" that something wasn't right about them? ""Ivan"" and his gang surely would be as smart as and prepared as our Secret Service guys were, don't you think? I also agree with those who mentioned ""Executive Decision""'s way of getting on-and-off the plane was much cleverer (liked that movie, too). I also wondered howcome that guy who opened the door didn't sucked-away, but I was waiting with eyes open-wide to see what was coming-up next. I also spotted there was something not quite right about him, too. You know how the camera pauses on those guys and you gotta think fast.........when I REALLY started enjoying the movie was while I was reading all the stuff you guys threw at it. I mean, like those were pretty heavy weapons they were firing inside the fuselage; and, The Prez. was a pretty-good shot, because Vietnam was a pretty serious spat; do you think the REAL Air Force One has been fitted with an escape-pod?, and how quickly they were looking for it; yeah, I loved the laughing secretary, just waiting to be snatched-up; and all that political competition in DC; doesn't every one in the country know the Vice-Prez. is next in command, always ?; was so proud that Glenn Close had the gumption not to sign the petition (sweet woman!); I really was concerned for The ""Prez.'s family; ""my dad is a great man"" gave me a twitch, then, but I really didn't know that Oldman is always the bad-guy; I was unaware his Russian-accent was so bad till you guys told me, and I agree it's time to get off that bad-mouthing the Russians (I mean, Bush and Putin are friends, aren't they?); that salute between the fighter-plane pilot and The Prez. was sharp ! ""get off my plane"" was something surely The Prez. would have said, huh? I saw ""Firewall"" first and now am pleased to see that Ford was still feisty after 1997. Lots of stuntmen, don't you think? I saw a long list.....So, now I've had a very good laugh reading your trashy comments, and must admit I STILL like the movie. No doubt, I'll watch it again and get all the guffaws in the right place, I promise. All you folk who thought it was one of the best ever, you were awfully brave - hope you have the DVD to get-in some more patriotism.I got the DVD for some PR stuff, so I'm really ahead that I got a good movie, intentionally a comedy or not. I didn't compare it to ""Das Boot"", even though Peterson and Marlowe got it together for a fine 2-hour watch. I'm sure all those people from foreign countries who were P.O.ed about ""braggy American's"" have seen some home-grown stuff they can crow about, too - if they haven't, then they should get busy. Maybe a little development of ""Radek's"" character could've given the Russians something to shout about - looked like a pretty nasty grunt to me.10, indeed !!! I thought the plane was gorgeous and all the other actors-actresses did a swell job. Whether you think the price to see the movie was an insult, they all made money. Give them a break! We all need an easy job some time or other....... P.S. 8/9/06:Just watched again, with subtitles: press-agent tells the Russies the fuselage is totally bullet-proof......",Air Force One
106,pkzeewiz,Now could Obama do this...no way!,4,19 May 2010,"After leaving a conference in Russia, some bad guys posing as journalists board the Air Force One with the president and much of his staff. They have an inside guy and these Russian baddies take the plane hostage, claiming to kill a passenger every half hour until their leader is released from prison, but Han Solo and Indian Jones are both on board so thats not gonna happen.OK so maybe not, but Harrison Ford does a great job in this action thriller. I have seen this film several times and it was always a nice film to set through. Lots of kills and action, and lots of great actors and good direction. Oldman plays a great bad guy and it is just a fun little film for action or thriller/suspense lovers.Wolfgang Peterson is a good director and he has some tricky shots here but pulls them off well. Jerry Goldsmith's score is pretty good too, hard to believe Randy Newman was once attached, he should stick to Disney films. Jerry isn't too over the top and I thought it worked out just fine.Acting wise we have a great cast. Harrison Ford as the president and I am so glad he got the part, it was written with Kevin Costner in mind but he didn't take it because he was working on The Postman...he kind of sucks anyway. Glenn Close did great as the vice president, Gary Oldman made a great bad guy too. Other key players included Phillip Baker Hall, Bill Smitrovich, Andrew Divoff, Xander Berkeley, Dean Stockwell, Glenn Morshower and William H. Macy.Some of the effects during the crash were kinda bad, but all and all it was a great film. 4/10 stars.",Air Force One
107,GeoPierpont,"The ""A"" Team: Gary Oldman and FAX Lady!",5,12 August 2014,"Who does not worship at the altar of the evil incarnate Gary Oldman? OK given his ""Immortal Beloved"" venture, went against type but he represents the zenith of scare tactics even with the most insipid of actors, Harrison Ford. You can tell he did not know what hit him when his eyes realllly bugged out in all of the strangleholds by Oldman. Ford was in real pain and fear and I was cheering, FINALLY a real emotion from this one noter.The only dialogue worth mentioning was the reference to killing 100K Iraqis to affect pump price reductions. This sentimental ""USA All the Way"" notion would fall on deaf ears today given the lowest ratings for leadership. I am confident we would be overjoyed with a huge military base from China near Los Angeles. There are approximately 800 'known' bases around the world, that is some kinda democracy imho.Where did they discover the FAX Lady? She was awarded PostMaster General for sending a 3line FAX, and she LOVES Skydiving! I believe that honor would be best bestowed to the President's daughter, she had it all under control. Another astute observation is the Russian actors sure were good looking and hard to view as enemies, they even work out! However, not enough for that savage cunning 53YO President who kicked a$$ in 'Nam 30+ years prior.I respect the director for his other projects, i.e. Das Boot, unclear how he would accept this dirge of gratuitous.... you name it, they had it. Consequently, hilarity ensues with this many hits and more misses than is conceivable. Congrats Hollywood!PS - Could not believe how President's wife looked and sounded like Sharon Stone.",Air Force One
108,HelloTexas11,fine action flick & The Scene,8,16 June 2008,"'Air Force One' is a movie with one terrific scene, one of the all-time great action scenes I think in film history, and it's so good, it tends to overshadow the rest of the film, which isn't bad either. But before getting to it, a quick overview. Harrison Ford plays President James Marshall, en route back to the U.S. from Russia with his wife and daughter and various government officials. The crux of the movie, that Air Force One could be hijacked, calls for an almost complete suspension of disbelief that few other movies require. The scenario as played out is about as plausible as possible, which is, the head of the president's Secret Service detail is a traitor. If you can get past that without summoning all your critical faculties and walking out of the room, 'Air Force One' is a hell of a lot of fun and a real roller-coaster ride. And there are moments, too, that are painful to watch, such as when a young press secretary is murdered by terrorists. The director, Wolfgang Petersen, knows how to hold on to the audience's collective neck by the jugular, keeping the suspense high and the tension tight. For the most part, it's very convincing, particularly the scenes on board the plane (though the special effects are variable). The parts in the situation room at the White House are, oddly enough, not quite as believable. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell are the VP and Secretary of Defense, respectively; they and the various generals don't really do much except sweat the crisis out. There are a number of neat little touches throughout; the hostages sending a fax from Air Force One, the dumping of fuel and then the subsequent re-fueling 'scam.' All very clever. But then there is The Scene. When the group of terrorists led by Gary Oldman's character get the go-ahead signal from the corrupt Secret Service agent, what follows is several minutes of superbly-orchestrated mayhem as passengers are shot, the cockpit crew locks themselves in to land the plane, and the rest of the Secret Service detail tries desperately to save the president. It's all frantically and furiously convincing, right down to the last two agents getting the president downstairs and into the ubiquitous 'escape pod' (you know, that's the one-man capsule the White House is forever denying exists), protecting him with their lives until the pod can be ejected and sent parachuting to earth. Movies just don't get any more exciting than this. There is so much going on at once, one doesn't dare blink for fear of missing something. 'Air Force One' would be worth seeing for this scene alone; the good news is the rest of the movie is very entertaining as well.",Air Force One
109,monkeysgalore,This Movie is Awesome,10,12 January 2019,"This movie is awesome. Sure, it's a little flawed, and you obviously need to suspend some belief in order to enjoy it, but don't you have to do that with most action movies? I mean, it's 'Die Hard on a plane', you're gonna have to suspend some belief.The plot centers around US president John Marshall, who has just announced that America will not negotiate with terrorists after a successful kidnapping of a foreign dictator. However, terrorists from the dictator's country seize control of Air Force One during a flight, and Marshall, who is on trapped board, is forced to fight to save his family and the rest of the hostages on board.Andrew W. Marlowe has written an excellent script, which is greatly complimented by a spellbinding performance by Harrison Ford, and an excellent villain performance from Gary Oldman. Ford usually delivers excellent performances on screen, and really makes us care about his characters and what happens to them, and this is no exception. Ford really draws us in and sells his role as the president. He is one of my favorite actors, and one of the finest working actors out there. Oldman's performance as the terrorist leader is excellent too, and he is a pretty menacing villain.Wolfgang Petersen helms the project, directing with style and flare, and he really makes the film work, giving an at times tight, almost claustrophobic feel, which I really liked. He competently handles the action sequences, and I'm surprised he hasn't made more action films, his only other real foray into the genre being In the Line of Fire (1993), another political action thriller starring Clint Eastwood. But nevertheless, wether or not his resume has few action films, he does his best here.Now obviously, like others have noted, there are flaws, as with a lot of films. Little things, like;1. How did the terrorists take over the plane? Is that even possible?2. Even with military training, could the president really defeat an armed group of terrorists?3. What's with all the weapons on the plane?4. How could the terrorists so easily overtake all of the secret service guys on board? Etc.There are things like this that one does have to suspend belief for, and I did, but these things didn't bother me because the movie was so well-written and acted, and I was engaged in the plot and the characters. The good honestly outweighs the bad, and the performances really bring the script to life, particularly (as mentioned earlier) Ford and Oldman.There's some good action, with some well-made, realistic-looking fist fights, some great gun-battles, and an excellent climax and plane crash (even if the special effects are really dated by today's standards). The fights in particular are really great and brutal, and the action is violent and hard-hitting, and there was a surprising amount for a political action thriller. I have to say that I think Harrison Ford does some of the best fight scenes out there. They look vicious, realistic, and brutal, and they're not these drawn-out martial arts ballets. He gets tired and clumsy, and looks like a real person fighting for their life.I highly recommend this film, since it's such a good action-thriller, and surprisingly safe for an R rated film (no sex or nudity, and only one f-bomb). I would honestly put it my top 5 (or even 3) Harrison Ford films, and highly recommend it to fans of Ford, Oldman, or the action genre, or just if you want to be entertained.",Air Force One

113,mr_popcorn,Mr. President Action Star,7,12 April 2008,"Air Force One. A film about a president kicking some serious Russian ass...30,000 feet high up in the air. That pretty much sums up the films premise but lemme elaborate it further: The President of the United States has captured a renegade General, he goes on and speaks about it in a summit in Russia. Upon his way home aboard his big metallic cylinder with wings also called the ""Air Force One"", some loyalist Russian insurgents hijacks the plane and demands the General to be freed. Mr. President Action Star jumps into action ala Chuck Norris and starts owning the Russian fools and eventually kills Loyalist Leader with the Kickass Beard. Mr. President Action Star saves the day, prevents Renegade General from being freed and lives another day to rule USA.Mr. President Action Star is portrayed by Harrison Ford. The everyman's protagonist. Be it CIA Operative Jack Ryan, archaeologist/treasure hunter Indiana Jones and the feisty Millennium pilot Han Solo, he is your guy. To be honest, I have never seen Ford in an antagonist role and I wonder how he will play it out, since he's so used at being the everyman's protagonist. In this one though, I can say that he was an effective hero. Putting his family first, not backing down in a fight and never gives up. Great acting.The Loyalist Leader with the Kickass Beard is portrayed by the equally menacing Gary Oldman. He was awesome in ""Fifth Element"" and I can say the same thing here. That thick Russian accent did it for him and of course, the evil factor: He killed an unarmed lady, shot a bald guy point blank in the head and terrorizes the childhood of a young little girl. So eeeeevil.The director Wolfgang Petersen did an incredibly good job in entertaining the audience for 120 minutes. He approached the audience with his unique style of storytelling with a lot of action and he ended it quite nicely. Now, if only they didn't kill Poor Hapless William H. Macy.7 stars.",Air Force One
114,moviedude1,Theatrically interesting...but in reality????,8,6 June 2007,"I first saw this film some time ago, and the idea of the President's plane being taken over is a nice plot, but the reality of it is a little bizarre, even before the incidents of 9-1-1.On a diplomatic trip overseas, President Ford is informed a terrorist leader has been taken forcibly from the leader's home in the dead of night from the US Navy Seals. Upon hearing this, he goes to great efforts (against his Cabinet's wishes) to make known the US's stand on terrorism and his plane is taken hostage en route home in an effort to release the terrorist.A good sub-plot takes place back on US soil, where Dean Stockwell's character attempts to make a power play by taking advantage of the situation (he should have been thrown in jail next to the captured terrorist.This film reminds me of the movie catch phrase from about twenty years ago where the end of the trailer kept telling whoever was watching it to keep telling themselves, ""It's only a movie! It's only a movie!"" I feel anyone wanting to let foreigners ride aboard Air Force One should be forced to watch this film, as I feel that would be the only other good it would serve.Cinematic value is good...9 out of 10 stars.

115,nims-1975,Great film which has some powerful action and great acting,8,20 May 2020,"Air Force One is about the US President President James Marsall(played by Harrison Ford) who when he decides to never negotiate with a terrorist government and boards his plane Air Force One is under a lot of pressure. Russian Terrorists lead by the malicous, manipulative, heartless and dangerous Ivan Korshunov(played by Gary Oldman) raid and Hijack the plane Air Force One that he is on and want one of their malicious Russian Terrorists Radek(played by Jurgen Prochnov) who is in jail to be realeased. President Marshall refuses and his life and the other lives of the other American passengers on the plane are put under threat. The government are very concerned about what is happening and about President Marshalls life. People such as Vice President Kathryn Bennett(played by Glenn Close) also have great concerns about what's happening to Air Force One, President Marshalls life, his family and are extremely shocked by the Korshunovs malicious requests and demands. It's down to President Marshall to kill Korshunov and these malicious Russian Terrorists. Korshunov kidnaps President Marshalls wife Grace Marshall(played by Wendy Crewson) and daughter Alice Marshall(played by Liesel Matthews) holds them hostage and threatens to kill them while he is on board with President Marshall. Korshunov has killed many important government mps who know Marshall and he won't stop. Korshunov is very malicious, manipulative, dangerous and shows no compassion for anyone but himself and his men. The action in this film was very good and the Aerial sequences were also very good but things like the fight scenes could have been better. I first thought whether this film was a copy of the excellent film Passenger 57 but it wasn't because this film is completely different. Harrison Ford did some excellent acting as a President and Gary Oldman did some excellent acting as a malicious, manipulative and dangerous Russian Terrorist. What stopped this film from being an in between very good and excellent film or excellent film was that it should have taken too much time for President Marshall to combat the Russian Terrorists. He took far too long to carefully and quickly come out and kill these malicious Russian Terrorists. The film Air Force One is a very good film which could have been better but it did have some powerful action, tension, drama and excellent acting by Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close, Wendy Crewson, Liesel Matthews, Paul Guilfoyle, Xander Berkeley, William H.

So the visual effects are very good, the acting is over the top but solid, with Gary Oldman giving yet another rendition of the villain. The problem is it is so stupid.  Here they are making out that the President is the most powerful decision making man in the country, I'm sorry but is this a fantasy?  we all know that is far from the truth in reality.

119,refinedsugar,Predictable Summer Fare,5,23 October 2001,"Harrison Ford is President James Marshall and he's caught on Air Force One with a bunch of terrorists. That's the movie in a nutshell. Any simarility between him and the character of James Ryan he played in the Tom Clancy films is probably unintentional, but I couldn't help but see him as the same man. His character isn't that deep or well written enough to separate them apart and neither is any other character including the head Russian terrorist played by Gary Oldman. Who might I mention really gets to flex his acting muscle as an ultra left wing nut Ivan Korshunov. I keep thinking the only thing that could make him seem more scary is if they had named him Boris. That's sarcasm, folks.There's really not much positive to say about Air Force One. It's a predictable mainstream Hollywood action vehicle with nothing terribly standing out. The direction is adequate, the story is threadbare and the cast just goes through the paces for the most part. Needless to say this flick isn't on the same level of the Tom Clancy / Harrison Ford collaborations.The underlying story mechanism can be somewhat excused for being predictable (we know the plane has to come down sometime - it's a plane after all), but with subplots treading cliché terroritory and very little character spice or variety in scene placement, Air Force One goes down like Chinese food - appetizing at first, left feeling hunger an hour later. Noteworthy is how terribly wasted Glenn Close is cast as the female Vice President while some of the special effects are just downright laughable.

Although, after boarding Air Force One, the uninvited guests come along and board it as well. These uninvited guests board the Air Force One excusing as ordinary journalists, while they really are Russian men which are secretly planning to free the extremist General Ivan Radek. As the right opportunity came along, the hijackers killed many of the President's staff as well as keep the rest of them hostage, among them are the president's wife and daughter. As soon as the plane was overtook by the terrorists, the President and a pod disappeared from the plane, as they assumed the president escaped via the pod, which turns out to be wrong as the pod was found empty and unopened. Never knowing the President's current location, vice president Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) is now in charge of the situation until the President's reappearance. All the hijackers want is to free General Radek, and so they say, the American President was responsible for his prison. Vice President refuses to give the order of free the General as she believes that the president didn't die or left the plane. As soon as the hijackers learn that there is someone on the lower part of the plane, that isn't  one of them they warn that if the mysterious man doesn't reveal himself the hostages are going to die one by one in every five minutes.Revealing the rest of  the plot would be giving to much away from the movie's thrilling and adventuring action. Wolfgang Petersen revealed himself as a reasonable action director in this film as it relies on a plot somehow well written as it gave him, once more is talent for action and dramatic sequences. Technically this film works considerably, the sound design and performance were outstanding (nominated for Academy Award's best sound), some special effects work out good, while some of them look somehow cheesy or computer gamed and lead the viewer on how they could have been achieved better than in the current sequence.

So then he give back against the bad bad boys. As usual it is russians that are the bad guys ( often it also is Germans or Asians ). And here you also put them in a picture that says: Big, fat, bearded, and drinking. Germans are always cold, hard, and without mercy, while Asians runs around and kicks the heroes in the head with a deadly Tae-Kwan-do-kick. And the leading villain in this movie has similar face-expressions that Alan Rickman had in ''Die Hard''. Here it is Gary Oldman. He does it almost as good as Rickman did. In  order of the manual this bad guy is against USA and he wants to create a third world war. And of course the ''invincible'' goverment does not like this idea very much but ( of course ) they can't do anything about it until the president comes.

A bad combination. After they take over the plane, they learn the president's escape pod had launched. What they don't know is that that he is still onboard, bent on saving his family and friends.The movie is perfectly casted and well acted. Harrison Ford is the best movie president ever. You watch this movie wishing he really was a president. He is caring, brave, and very clever. Everything the real president is not. Although i loved Ford here, i found myself rooting for Gary Oldman sometimes. It's my love of bad guys acting up. He is terrifying, yet i somehow agreed with some of the things he said about America's foreign policy. But i didn't entirely agree with him blowing innocent people's heads off.The action scenes are well-made and very entertaining, if a tad unbelievable. The one thing that pulled me out of the fun was the presidents staff acting like he was god. I know he is a good president, but come on. It's not like he could walk on water. Still, this is a great adventure and one of Harrison Ford's best. 8/10",Air Force One

Harrison Ford is cast as the president. Early on the film establishes the fact that he does things that he thinks are right, even if they are politically damaging.  This raises the question of how the heck this guy got himself elected, let alone whether he would be able to take on a group of armed terrorists all by himself.  The special effects were rather unconvincing, and in a movie with a poor plot, that is going to be a big problem.  This is also one of those crisis management films where people in suits pace about while ranting on in an authoritative manner.  Nothing innovative about that.  Many non-Americans seem annoyed by this movie, but remember this: It was directed by a GERMAN. Go blame him.

But they didn't count on the president fighting back. Alone, he must rescue his family, the hostages, and fight to keep Raddack from being released. But once he solves one problem, another one is started.Before I saw this, I thought it was just going to be like Die Hard on an airplane. But I was wrong. What made this movie great was the acting.

You do see the life of an action star sure puts a toll on you're body and you can see Harrison waining in some scenes but overall he kills it, probably the last great action role from Ford.

140,knucklebreather,Great 90s action flick,7,31 October 2009,"The 1990s were something of a golden age of action flicks, when the directors took the suspenseful pacing techniques and crowd-pleasing ""Good guys, bad guys"" motifs perfected in the 70s and 80s and fused those tactics with the robust budgets and maturing computer graphics suddenly available. By the 2000s many directors were forgetting (or not even learning) that special effects alone can't make a movie, and future generations might remember the big-budget action flicks of the 1990s, which remember to work on the script and the more traditional elements of direction in addition to the special effects, more fondly than the many 2000s actions films where the directer dwells almost entirely on getting the effects right.""Air Force One"" is one such 1990s film where the elements of the film without special effects are more than just hackneyed filler in between CGI sequences. Okay, so the film's story is still shallow, it always is, but you don't ask the summer blockbuster to rival George Orwell or anything in terms of depth of political thought. The main thing is that it entertains you and keeps it at least vaguely believable as you munch your popcorn and sip your soda. There's a certain sequence of suspense, heroics, setbacks, triumphs, evil ploys, noble sacrifices... a good action flick is constantly moving from one element to the next, sequencing them in just the right order so as to keep the audience riveted. It's more art than science, but watch a film like Jurassic Park or Apollo 13 to see it being done right. Others, like Terminator 2 or the original three Star Wars, of course, rise above the formula to thrill on their own terms, but there's nothing wrong with a formula action flick, as far as I'm concerned.""Air Force One"" does a better job than most of the 1990s flicks of following the formula. In the post-9/11 world, a lot of ""Air Force One"" seems a bit silly and overly Hollywood, but once you get past the introduction the film has aged quite well and is still very enjoyable.",Air Force One

The ""plot"" concerns a bunch of 2 dimensional euro-terrorists with the obligatory thick accents taking over Air Force One, and the glorious US military coming to the rescue, led by the President himself who just happens to be a war hero from Nam. Sure, it's a slick Hollywood actioner and I remain a fan of Harrison Ford but this film is sheer CRAP, and I don't care how much hate mail I get for saying so! I honestly believe that if Julius Caeser had access to modern technology 1,900 years ago he would have made a VERY similar movie. With hindsight, if only they'd smeared the terrorists with boot-polish and made them wear turbans. Even better! Now compare this film with your REAL President, a guy who can't even eat a pretzel without falling over. One of my favourite Americans is the great intellectual icon Gore Vidal, God knows how old but still with a mind as sharp as a razor. He recently said: "" We Americans are probably the only democratic nation in history that honestly believes its own propaganda, and that's kinda scary."" Well said Mr Vidal. If ONLY Colin Powell had run for President this dreadful movie might, just might, seem slightly realistic, but you folks chose to elect and then re-elect Rain Man, so I hope you'll respect us Europeans having a jolly good laugh at it.

142,charlessmith702210,Fictional president was able to fight with guns and with his hands,8,2 June 2006,"Actually, James Marshall was the varied soldier on Air Force One---good at shooting enemies with firearms and good at hand-to-hand combat. It was striking how he kills one of the hijackers in the tail cock by breaking the bad guy's neck by first choking him with a strap attached to a parachute, and then, pulling off the rip cord to complete the task.He was then able to call off Ivan Radek's escape from prison after being tortured by the hijackers into releasing this general...a general who is almost akin to something like a Russian-style Hugo Chavez or, more properly, a new Josef Stalin.Radek eventually gets shot with real AK-47s after he tried to move after he was ordered not to move after he sees freedom from prison walls...And I had realized the reason why 6 enemy fighters from Kahakstan wanted to shoot the president's plane down.....the fighters, who were loyal to Radek, wanted strong revenge for James Marshall's decision to not allow Radek to be freed from prison as well as causing Radek's death. The enemy planes do strike out one the plane's engines and hit the plane's stabilizer with 30 mm guns until the Halo escort fighter planes---or those so-called 6 good-guy fighters who were told to back off by the hijackers of Air Force One---fight back against the enemies, taking out 3 of the MiGs. One of the good fighters--the pilot of Halo 2----does a very daring feat--creating a human shield against an enemy missile when the plane lost all of its countermeasures....that is, the pilot was willing to let its plane be blown up by the missile instead of Air Force One. This was what the vice president, acted by Glenn Close, wanted by her phrase,""....use any and all means to protect the President."" The suicide mission was successful but the big explosion caused even more damage to the plane's stabilizer.And that big twist was that character who said ""We have a Code Red!"" when the hijackers started shooting inside the plane. He pretended to be one of the good guys, actually pretending successfully to mask himself as another Secret Service agent when the hijack came at its terrible points and good points. In the end, he was a guy who was eventually on the side of Radek and the Russian ultranationalists.",Air Force One

144,jillbeckinheim7,Good action film with Ford,8,1 November 2021,"Ford plays beloved, too good to be true, strong willed (and therefore clearly democratic) President James Marshall (small joke.) Ford is just mind blowingly pure as the President although he makes some very controversial decisions in the course of the film (the cusp of them being letting a woman die to save and protect everyone else.) Still he is the kind of man you'd want in office but never get. On top of that he is strong and determined and a kick ass fighter. No one else could have played this role as well or as brilliantly. Equally as impressive is his nemesis in the film played by Gary Oldman. Oldman plays a brilliant madman determined to have his countries former leader released from Russian captivity. The two of them against each other is just mind blowingly perfect. Ford's character is one of the best action heroes in Hollywood history and Oldman's villain is right up there with him. Glenn Close gives a terrific performance as the Vice President who stands firmly beside the President at every turn. The rest of the cast don't get a lot of screen time but they are so important because the supporting cast is beyond impressive including Wendy Crewson and Liesel Matthews as the first lady and their daughter. William H. Macy (amazing as always), Dean Stockwell (also very impressive role for a small one), and Xander Berkeley as the Secret Service agent secretly turned rogue.From the moment the film begins to the moment the plane leaves the ground the action is non stop. The characters are all ones you come to care about and become involved in completely making the action all the more riveting and edge of your seat.

Some parts could have been a little more believeable, but it was still very fun and entertaining.The acting in this movie was good. Harrison Ford, as always, did an excellent job as the star of this movie. Gary Oldman, the greatest movie bad guy of all time, did not disappoint. It was cool to see Glenn Close as the vice president, keeping the blood-sucking politicians at bay. Another great performance, although not given enough credit, is from William H. Macy, who is one of my favorite of the lesser known actors.The storyline is fair, but nothing special or too original. The only difference is in this case, the president is not a hostage but the man fighting the terrorists. Terrorists manage to hijack Air Force One and kidnap many important people, the presidents kids, some politicans, some secret service guys and a bunch of extras they threw in to fill up the plane. They thought the president had escaped, but the truth was he stayed behind to fight the terrorists, retake the plane and save his family.This movie is a great action flick which I enjoyed a lot.

It was just a spur-of-the-moment film, a movie I decided to see right on the spot. I was pleasantly surprised with this crackingly enjoyable thriller.Following an impassioned speech in which he takes a hardline stance against terrorism, President James Marshall (Harrison Ford), together with his wife and their 12-year-old daughter, boards the titular jet to return to the States from Moscow. Midflight, however, the plane is taken hostage by an extremist nationalist Russki faction, led by bearded baddie Kurshonov (Gary Oldman). The group's demands are clear cut and brutal: the release of their imprisoned leader General Radek (Jurgen Prochnow) or they will kill a passenger every half-an-hour. In the melee, Marshall eludes the hijackers, feigns escape in an emergency pod and begins to wage a one man guerrilla war to gain control of the plane. This clears the decks for some taut-as-piano-wire cat and mousery as the pumped-up Prez - who it turns out is a decorated Vietnam vet - plays hide and seek with the bad guys, knocking them off one by one in a manner that more befits Clint than Clinton.Harrison Ford, the star of this film, slightly overacts but his performance is enjoyable and he enjoys himself to the extreme. Glenn Close is the star of this impressive little gem, she sparkles with glee in her memorable role.

Any White House PressSecretary would be far too astute to let a self-describe TV journalist on Air Force One (AF1). The very first thing they would do is check the reporter's credentials and publication/broadcast record.2. The spectacle of a 747 jumbo jet careering through an airport on an aborted landing is simply light-years beyond absurd.3. Why would AF1 have a stash of enough assault rifles to take over a small country? And, with all the gunplay in the passenger cabin there's not one bullet hole in the fuselage?4. I have it on good authority that Air Force One does have countermeasures, but putting the president in an escape pod  though fundamental to the plot  it just inane. That's the *last* thing you would do with the U.S. President at 30,000 ft.5. Equally ridiculous is the idea that AF1 conveniently has more parachutes onboard than the Titanic had life preservers. Just as silly is the image of Washington bureaucrats easily jumping off the plane at 15,000 ft.6. I've been inside an open, stripped-down 747 airframe, there isn't nearly as much room as shown on the cargo deck. There certainly isn't room for a cargo deck vending machine?! I could go on and on, but this film is another example of filmmakers believing that movies goers are gullible enough to swallow any tall tale for the sake of lots of action shots and melodrama.

There are moments when the terrorists make arguments on their behalf, like ""You murdered a hundred thousand Iraqis to save a nickel on a gallon of gas!"", which is basically true, but because the movie has to make money and the American audience has to ""like"" it, the film has to be made politically correct for them and the terrorists must thereby be proved wrong.

Sure, he wouldn't have the money that he's having at his disposal now, but remember: DAS BOOT had a rather infinitesimal budget and nevertheless managed to thrill, enlighten and entertain millions of viewers. Now, what do we have: A German director who directs patriotic and nationalistic filth that invites the average American Joe to believe in the moral and military superiority of his own country. A movie that doesn't really discuss the topics at hand and divides the cast into good and evil with no shades of grey at all.

It was the film that introduced me to two of my all time favorite actors, Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman, and introduced me to a kick-ass quality of movies which I compared to this.The story entails a band of Russian terrorists, led by the always brilliant and cunning Gary Oldman, sneaking aboard Air Force One, the president of the United State's personal aircraft. The president, played expertly by Harrison Ford, stays aboard to do combat with the terrorist in the bowels (baggage deck) of the airplane. It is kind of just ""Die Hard on Air Force One"" but I still think its good.I have to mention that this movie is directed by Wolfgang Petersen, the same man who gave us Das Boot, one of the greatest films ever made. He knows how to direct his actors with dignity and make them seem very real given these circumstances (except Poseidon that was a bad movie) The action scenes are very convincing, especially the mid-air rescue at the end of the movie, as well as the hand to hand combat that Ford engages in.The performances are absolutely phenomenal in this film. Harrison Ford gives us a President who goes with his gut on the new policy he gives at the beginning of the movie, and who will never leave his family to die, unlike everyone else who would bolt. Then there is Gary Oldman. Good God is this guy brilliant. His character Ivan is one of the best villains ever put to movies. He's a patriot, he's mean, he's tender about his past, he's imposing, and he is just menacing. Oldman is one of the best actors ever and when you put him with Harrison Ford, the chemistry between hero and villain is out of this world. Glenn Close rounds out as the iron willed Vice President who will still believe in the president even while the others aren't so sure given the predicament.Like Mary Poppins, this film introduced me to the great world of cinema and inspired me to become a filmmaker at a young age.

But somehow, the good acting, and acceptably good score, make it watchable, and even fun.Randy Newman's score was rejected? Wow, Randy, that was a close call... Be careful what you offer to score from now on. Jerry Goldsmith's score was fine... Just what they needed for a pot-boiler like this. I really like Randy Newman's music, but his effort would have been wasted on this so-typically-Hollywood flick, I think.Wolfgang Petersen says, in the DVD Extra Features, that Harrison Ford performs all his stunts; I'm sure he meant the fistfights, but not the shots of him dangling on an Air Force-provided cable a thousand feet in the air! (Could have been a ""digital double"" I suppose...) But, still, the rest was pretty impressive stuff.I do like the premise. The President of the United States of America (hooray) gets really angry at terrorists and the misery they are causing... and then publicly declares it's their turn to sweat. Whew, they answer him immediately. It's just that when Harrison Ford does it, it sounds so much more laudable than in real life. Ha ha. Really.Anyway, I own the DVD (one of nine total). For me that's praise right there. I even watch it once every two or three months.If you rent the DVD, you'll enjoy it. If you buy the DVD, pay no more than $5.00 in a cut-out bin.

161,moysant,US President as Hero,5,4 October 2003,"Yet another movie with the US president as hero (think ID4). But basically American propaganda that says 'don't mess with the USA cos the president will kick your ass'. Considering the reality of GW Bush dressed up recently in pilot gear to go visit a post-Iraq destroyer, it actually is quite prosiac. Anyway, violent nonsense - yes I'm sure a president can out shoot five or six bullet proofed-vested hardcore terrorists in a confined space! But beside the stupidity, the scene with the russian president sweating, swearing and drinking vodka because he has to release a terrorist general to save the US president is hilarious, as is the moment when said terrorist general (with fake beard) gets shot at the last moment as the prisoners sing a very harmonious liberation song. Even Sadam Hussein gets a piece of the action. (You have to ask if Hollywood movies like this helped grease up the US public so they'd believe invading countries like Afganhistan and Iraq was justified). I usually like Harrison Ford movies. And Glen Close, but her character does more damage to high profile female politicians than anything else - she comes across as hormonal and over emotional!Really, in twenty years time they'll be teaching this in propaganda sociology classes the world over.",Air Force One

The things that were not good about Air Force One is that the special effects looked horrible, unconvincing, unbelievable and looked like they did not even belong to the picture in the first place. I felt sick looking at them. The movie also lacked in breathlessness and in being spectacular and had a poor filmmaking quality feel to it. However, the movie was arguably redeemed by impressive performances from Ford, Oldman and Close, a strong emotional side to it and a flawless, sharp direction from Wolfgang Petersen. Moreover, Gary Oldman was an attractive and cold villain and by his behavior and actions managed to make me feel cold and feel hatred toward him. Well done on all of that.

Harrison Ford is the least Presidential-acting US President ever to appear on film -- and that includes the likes of Polly Bergen, John Ritter, and Donald Pleasance.  Gary Oldham is every cold-war caricature mixed together, then run amok, all wrapped up in a preposterous accent, overblown mannerisms, and a maniacal laugh.  Xander Berkeley's stunt was almost as impossible as his wooden performance.  Paul Guilifoyle is the most disloyal and ignorant Chief-of-Staff ever depicted.  Wendy Crewson is doing a nothing job, and does less with it.  The pacing is so painstakingly slow, it was hard to believe this was an action movie.  The special effects were labored and cumbersome, and the score was a near-perfect parody of action movie scores.I had to write all this because IMDB no longer accepts four-line reviews.

Whether you're a huge Harrison Ford fan or not, AF1 is contrived and silly. In typical Hollywood fashion, all the ""bad guys"" are white and Russian. Over the top acting by most of the cast and idiotic plot/subplots can't be salvaged by action sequences that make you wonder just how smart the bad guys could be since they can't seem to keep guns trained on hostages. Ford as the fictional U.S. President slinks around and growls the whole movie,looking like he's about to pass a kidney stone.

It was just barely believable but Ford gets you kind of involved as a man who puts saving the people he loves before any high ideas about saving the office of the presidency. Gary Oldman's character also brings up good points when he calls the President(Clinton, Bush, and especially Reagan, listen up) the biggest terrorist of the world, one who hides behind speeches about freedom and humanitarianism before he bombs and starves people to death on a mass scale.The premise was laughable, though. The terrorists can manage to hijack the most highly protected vessel in the world but cant seem to get rid of a middle aged man hiding in the pantry who's killing them one by one. And a handful of mall cops could have done a better job of protecting the plane than the Secret Service did in the movie, with or without a traitor in their midst.

Air Force One, the President of the US's personal plane, gets taken over by terrorists who have become embroiled in the takeover because of a renewed terrorist policy by the President (Harrison Ford). Gary Oldman plays the main terrorist threat, a rebel dissenter who is radical by his very nature, and as always is exceptional in his portrayal. The screenplay is good without being too impressive and the general plot means that the film is enjoyable and action packed. Ford is reliable playing the President who has to save the day whilst trying not to breach his terrorist pledges.

I finally saw it, and this was a #1 action movie. Harrison Ford was great as the president. He proved to be a great action hero. This was really cool, because the president is least likely to be an action hero. Action heros are usually cops or normal people. This was a change. ""Air Force One"" is about a terrorist takeover, but it doesn't rip off ""Die Hard."" It was original in it's own way. It wasn't all about the takeover. There is also a lot of strong drama in this movie. Gary Oldman played a totally vicious man in this movie, but every time he did something bad, he would justify his actions.What he says obviously doesn't give him an excuse for killing people, but he said it in a strong way. The action scenes were intense. The fight scenes with Harrison Ford and the terrorists were brutal. Every time I heard a punching sound, it was like ""Woa! That sounded cool!"" The special effects were also great. Especially in a scene where F/A 18s are fighting a group of MIGs. THis is a great movie filled with non-stop action, great acting, drama",Air Force One

The acting is toony from start to finish (especially the final act which is purely played for laughs)! Why is everyone running around the White House like decapitated chickens? Close, as  the Vice Prez looks and acts incompetent. Plus Stockwell, as the Defense Secretary acts like a big baby (I half expected someone to give him lollipop after a while)!

While this has happened occasionally throughout history (Hitler, Hussain), I cannot believe that the kind of person portrayed in this film is one of them.

Following that, well lat's say prepare yourself for an utter groan-fest!Then we have the hu-rah section of the movie where the gun-toting Mr President manages to single-handedly foil the terrorists plans, while an inept Gary Oldman singularly manages to not take advantage of having the president's wife and daughter in his grasp.As a final thought, just listen to the music throughout the film. Cheesey fanfares as Ford says to Goldman ""Get off my plane!', or as he's whisked off the plane before the final (rubbish CGI) crash.This film has so many feeble cliff hangers and head-in-your-hands moments that it should be consigned to 'How do I get those 2hrs of my life back?' archives.

Be careful, the line is likely to blow out the speakers on your home theater system, because for some reason, it's louder than every other sound in the movie. When I saw this film in the theater, an elderly woman died when that line was uttered. Apparently the sudden fluctuation of sound waves interfered with her brain impulses and her bodily functions just quit simultaneously.Gary Oldman is the master of accents.

I watched expecting to feel an adrenaline rush in the fight scenes, be shocked by lots of guns firing and explosions; whilst still being able to laugh at the occasional moment, I was not disappointed.It begins with an action scene and a big explosion, then the action goes away to give the characters some characterization and the terrorists a motive, then once the plane is hijacked its all guns blazing in what is basically a standard action film and exactly what is expected, except for one thing, being a massive Indiana Jones fan; I found it hard to take Harrison Ford seriously as the President, especially when he was getting in fights that where at times filmed in a very Indiana style, for example when he is falling from the parachute ramp is something straight from one of the Indie movies. The other slight problem I had with this film was its failure to explain little details... like the President is shoved in an escape hatch which is deployed (presumably with the President in), yet somehow he manages to get out and we see him crawling out from the top of a door, which I found very confusing. As an audience member in Hollywood films I find I have to turn off my film brain to watch them, but moments like this turn my film brain back on and this annoys me as I then can't enjoy the film for a while.So another Hollywood action blockbuster which is exactly what's expected ; if you like the sound of watching Indiana Jones as President with more explosions and less one-on-one combat this film is for you. If you want a film that makes you think and will change your life then perhaps not.7/10",Air Force One

Ludicrous and insulting to the intelligence in almost every scene, I might be able to forgive this if it were done in a campy, ""just for laughs"" style, but this is ridiculous!Harrison Ford was once one of my favorite actors, but after this debacle I will never again have the respect I once held for this thespian.  Every performance was completely over the top and subsequently unconvincing. The physics and logistical plot holes were unforgivable.  And the utter predictability is the final nail in this movie's coffin.  I would have walked out long before the end, but I just had to stay to see if I could see if what I predicted would come true.  As soon as it did, I split. That this movie received ANY positive reviews is revealing and sad, and the attitude that the world would end if anything happened to our beloved president frankly makes me embarrassed to be an American.

201,kezman436,"""Die Hard on a plane""",5,19 January 2020,"The above comparison may be used as humorous hyperbole by some, but I wish to use it to explain why I think this film deserves a 5/10.Let's start with Harrison Ford. There may be an apparent novelty in watching Ford play the President of the United States in an action thriller set on Air Force One, but the appeal ends there. There's nothing at all interesting or unique about his character. 'Die Hard' worked partly because John McClane was more than a one-note protagonist; he was a family man, hoping to reconcile with his wife and be there for his children. He had an arc; not to mention great one-liners and a gleefully pessimistic sense of humour. Ford's character is without any sort of depth, arc, or entertaining dialogue.I feel similarly about Gary Oldman's villain. He comes across very much like a stereotypical Russian bad guy, leading a group of other Russian men with sub-machine guns. There is practically nothing to distinguish him from other action-thriller antagonists. Going back to 'Die Hard', Hans Gruber was a brilliant and efficient mastermind, played wonderfully by Alan Rickman. His dialogue scenes with McClane juxtaposed an everyday NYPD cop/family man with an intelligent criminal; on the rare occasions when Oldman and Ford share the screen, it feels like you're merely watching one-dimensional characters.There are a handful of brief moments where the film almost attempts to get the audience to sympathise with Oldman's villain; that his motives may be sensible, or that the heroes and villains may not be as clearly distinguishable as we first thought. However, these passing glimpses are so brief and under-utilised that they feel out of place with the rest of the film, which represents the protagonists and antagonists in a much more simplified, traditional and patriotic manner.More broadly, the idea of an action thriller involving terrorists and hostages in an enclosed space is nothing new, hence the 'Die Hard' comparison. There's only so many times you can hear ""I will kill a hostage every (X) minutes until my demands are met"" before you get tired of it. 'Air Force One' suffers partially from adhering to genre cliches.That being said, the film isn't entirely without merit. The political aspect of the storyline is quite interesting, and characters have to be asking all sorts of difficult moral questions about how to resolve their situation to cause the least amount of harm, weighing up lives and consequences. These questions constantly change as the film continues; characters must adapt to the circumstances as power balances shift between heroes and villain. The film may have benefited slightly by including more of this. In addition, setting the action on the President's plane is one of the film's more unique decisions, and makes for some interesting situations and efficient tension.Overall, 'Air Force One' is a watchable action-thriller with a unique setting; it passes the time, but ultimately came across as rather forgettable to me.",Air Force One
202,capitan_movie,Typically stupid Hollywood action film,2,4 June 2000,"Gary Oldham's brilliant acting as the terrorist and Xander Berkeley and William H.

They held the passengers hostages and it is up to Ford to save the day.The action is a bit dramatic and over the top but I gotta love the rivalry between Ford and Oldman, who is so great and cute cute in a weird and non-threatening way, don't find him convincing as an villain. I admit sometimes I see movies only as my favorite actors are in them. Air Force One happens to be a good movie though.Feel some of the action's excitement wears off after Oldman leaves the scene as then it is mainly about the people getting off the plane in safety and of course they do eventually.Besides AFO, the Ford's movies that I also like are Firewall, The Fugitive, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger, Bladed Runner.",Air Force One

Even the 'strangle the bad guy with his parachute, break his neck and kick him out of the plane' is almost a complete carbon copy of a scene from Drop Zone. Then when Air Force One crashes, it looks like a scene from a bad video game, the effects are that bad. You expect the words Game Over to appear. The film conveniently ignores political reality (Kazakhstan has 40% Russian citizens and lots of Russian soldiers, they couldn't and wouldn't do this.

At times it's corny to the point of embarrassment, and it's soaked in the type of stars and stripes patriotism us Brits love to hate.But despite these flaws, this is one of my favourite films. Why, because it's so exciting, it doesn't require a Harvard diploma to enjoy and it's the classic 'good vs evil' that we all enjoy. Gary Oldmans terrorist ticks all the cliché boxes, and yet manages to be one of the most effective bad guys ever. He's such an evil character, and the series of brutal, cold-blooded executions means that every time I watch the film I really, really hate this guy, and when he gets his inevitable comeuppance, it's a great moment. There have been many brilliant pieces of dialogue in cinematic history, but few can make 'Get off my plane' for 'back of the net' elation. Of course it's cheesy, but that's the fun of it. The story bounces along at a good pace, with plenty of action and tense moments to keep the audience interested. The storyline is basic but functional, the struggle between the President and the Terrorists on board linked with Radek's release gives a really dramatic climax to the film.This film is not perfect, but it's an uncomplicated and exciting picture which asks nothing of it's audience. Just sit back and the nonsense wash over you and enjoy this film for what it is, a great story with a fantastic 'feel good factor' at the finale.

Apart from politics and direction of the incidents .. apart from the (Good guys) and (Bad guys) theme .. I want just to impress some concerns ..The Mr president which was performed by Harrison Ford is really an action star more than a political president as in the movie .. I want to know how could an old president (May be in the middle 50s of 60s years old) alone defeats a group of professional and highly trained and skilled terrorists??!! It was mentioned in the movie that this supreme president was a soldier and served in Vietnam .. but Vietnam was over in the 70th .. now after more than 30 years .. the skills and styles of fighting and one to one combats are now much different than in the time of Vietnam .. also the awesome president should be a retired soldier as he had entered the political track .. and even if he trains daily (If we suppose that he has enough time in his congested presidential schedule) he'll logically still not able to fight against the terrorists in a face to face combat ..Please take in mind that we are talking about a normal human being and not a super human .. This human was put in a situation in a plane with a bunch of youth merciless terrorists .. a highly skilled plane hijackers .. How can he stand a chance?! ..The gun fire, Uzis and automatic weapons were shot all over the plane's storage area and even in the plane it self .. and the bullets didn't damage any part of the plane's equipments or or at least hit a wall of the plane and pass throw it and destroying the plane which is the logical case .. So could any one tell me what is the super material the plane made of ?! Also, the super president could at last fly the plane even after it was hit by a missile from a Meg fighter !! and how ?! by applying the instructions from the plane Radio !! Is it possible to fly such a complex plane from an audio instructions ??!! I think it was better for this incredible president to play Microsoft Flight simulation !! Do anyone believe that it's possible for any human being to be suddenly pulled by a rope from a very fast plane in about a height (It was mentioned that the height was 15,000 miles) !! without breaking his rips and to be able to breath although of the height and the speed of flooding air with very thin Oxygin !!

220,AdderCowley,Not a classic but enjoyable,7,21 January 2008,"Air Force One is what you would expect, a trash action-thriller which borders almost on propaganda, but that does not make it a poor film. Obviously there is a constant barrage of American patriotism (how more patriotic can you get than the American President retaking a terrorist controlled air force one), but this does not make it a film which most people would vomit over. It is rather surprisingly quite entertaining.Despite the fact that the film is 2 hours long (a time which could have been easily shortened with the cutting of a few meaningless scenes at the end) but the film doesn't let up on the action or the excitement. Predominantly the film is a) watching Gary Oldman taunt the white house or executing passengers and b) watching Harrison Ford walking around looking confused in the baggage area, however there are quite a few gun fights and up-close-and-personal fight scenes which punctuate the banter and keep the audience gripped. None of this is particularly new but nevertheless is entertaining.The acting is surprisingly adequate. Most of the characters in the film haven't got particularly challenging roles, only Gary Oldman, Glenn Close and Harrison Ford who have to stretch their ability, which the best is of course Gary Oldman who it seems has to support almost the entire film with his menacing image, which he pulls off rather well. Although his accent isn't brilliant (see 5th element) he is still by far and away the most menacing of the baddies and the most interesting character. It is particularly satisfying to see him humiliate some of the bureaucratic and arrogant politicians in the white house: ""no one does this to America...""

An average American's ideal POTUS is near-mythology at this point, what with consistent talk of our own ""founding fathers"" and how they'd be ""rolling in their graves"" at the directions our political system take with every passing day. Harrison Ford here is about the closest you can get to apple pie American onscreen, being soft-spoken and humble, a lover of college ball, and most importantly, a war hero.The fantasy and premise here is so perfect, or perfectly groan-inducing, that it's probably best for everyone that it came out so average. There's enough triumphant action to satisfy its escapist nature, but its leveled against enough 90s cliche to make you say, ""That'd never happen"" in order to temper your expectations when you inevitably have to return to the real world. It's worth a watch to justify making a bucket of popcorn, inoffensive enough to be immediately pushed out of your mind by the latest news update from your phone.One thing that's really going for it is its hard-R factor, making it more brutal that you'd probably expect with a premise like this, but I think they could have gone farther with that. That's my fantasy at least, to see our President as an avenging angel drenched in his enemies' blood, but this movie is good too, if only to hang onto the now slippery idea of a President who is respectable to the very core, instead of one who's, say, incoherent and mean, or an affront to ideals of democracy or basic decency any time he opens his mouth.",Air Force One

The Cast - really solid all around, a bunch of recognizable faces that you cant quite put your finger on, and some big names. Harrison Ford leads the way, along with Gary Oldman as the Russian Terrorist. Both do a really great job. Xander Berkeley and Jurgen Prochnow both are other recognizable names.

Really annoying and doesn't show much emotion.The Plot - James Marshall(Ford) decides that the United States wont negotiate with terrorists at a big conference.

Everyone thinks Marshall is off the plane because Secret Service evacuated him, but he's ready to fight. Marshall starts attacking from the shadows, and Korshunov(Oldman) is slowly losing his patience. Marshall eventually is caught, and confronts Korshunov for the first time.

Even if it is not visible, it is there somewhere - in a dialog, in an American missile destroying a MIG, in the way the president orders everyone else to leave the doomed plane before himself... people are jumping to take the bullet for the president, even pilots placing their fighters to take the missile for the AF1 (oh, gosh, that was something)! It is extremely unrealistic, but hey - it's an action movie. That's the only reason I gave it two instead of one star - I guess it has all the elements an action movie is expected to have.So to summarize - this movie has a clear distinction between the good and the bad guys, ridiculous plot, cheesy music, the kind of patriotism and propaganda that makes you laugh...

239,Melanie82-1,His last real success,8,1 October 2008,"Waiting for Indiana Jones IV to come to pass, it is always time to reflect on the sad state of Harrison Ford's career, and as we flip through the years it seems to me he hasn't had a bona fide hit since 1997. (2000's WHAT LIES BENEATH probably made money, but few credit Ford's presence in that thriller for its success; possibly it was a hit due to the well-tuned script and the expert direction by Robert Zemeckis. In any case Michelle Pfeiffer--another star of the 1990s whose career has gone sadly awry--deserves half the credit as well.) Otherwise it's like a list of one disaster after another. K-19 THE WIDOWMAKER? Dead in the water. Hollywood HOMICIDE? Not a bad show but the public stayed away in droves. RANDOM HEARTS? When you look up ""catastrophe"" in the dictionary you get a still from this movie. SIX DAYS SEVEN NIGHTS? Awful. WATER TO WINE (2004)? Even his fans don't know what it is! I'm not sure FIREWALL will break the curse either, it sounds like a re-tread of an earlier Ford flop called FRANTIC. So when we look back and try to find the last good patch of Harrison Ford's once invincible streak, we come up with a thump against this indisputable box office sensation, which rules the theaters world wide for a brief spell in 97. The critics thought it piffle, but it answered a need in the US public, maybe to see a strong president defying the Russians one last time. Reactionary? No two moviegoers will read its plot the same way, but there are certainly cimilarities to the FOX TV hit ""24,"" which it foreshadowed in so many ways, even down to the canny use of amiably sinister Xander Berkeley, the husband in SAFE. And of course the death defying traumas that occur to Air Force One in both programs. Most of all, I think people long for a president who's more like James Marshall here, than the one we had in 1997 or the one we have now. He's a father figure, he's still vigorous and sexy, he's got a good sense of humor, knows his way around a gun AND he protects us from the threat of Glenn Close. AIR FORCE ONE itself was a sort of comeback project for the beleaguered Ford, whose previous films had been major disappointments--the terrible SABRINA remake and the muddled IRA thriller DEVIL'S OWN with Brad Pitt. I think at that minute we really needed Harrison Ford to start thinking about how to sustain a career. Instead he just must have said Ah Screw It and switched the remote to a then-new TV show called ALLY McBEAL. The rest is film history.",Air Force One

Our president is going to kick (...)! Doesn't that bother anyone? This movie screams Hollywood and follows it so faithfully its scary. In real life, for that is what we are trying to portray, would the president jump out of a falling plane, try to save his rogue commander or any of the other numerous things that never stop happening? Maybe...maybe not. Obviously on Air Force One he's a superman, because he is able to do all these things. Air Force One needs to come down out of the clouds and have some reality shot into it.

Harrison Ford, one of my favourite actor from that era has mediocre acting skills.

245,zereshk,"Gripping, for all the wrong reasons",7,20 September 2009,"Air Force One is a film that really makes me wonder whether the true intentions of the director are as transparent as they seem.It is strange enough in itself that a director who is himself not an American would produce a piece of thinly disguised US propaganda (who am I kidding? Not disguised at all! Naked, shaven and equipped with big flashing arrows pointing at it!). Not that Germans are immune to the grandiose nature of the nationalism (excuse me, I mean *patriotism* of course) that inspires many American films, and after all, films that portray German nationalism positively are not that well received, so what is a German director who likes trite militaristic show-offs and personality cults revolving around the local alpha male to do? But if you pay attention to the way the characters and the storyline are presented, it makes you wonder who is the real hero here. Sure, the president saves the day. Sure, the terrorists all die in the end and so does the man they were trying to free. I don't know if that's even a spoiler because most people probably guessed the ending from looking at the way the DVD cover was designed.But just compare the way James Marshall, the president, is presented and the way the top terrorist, Ivan Korshunov, is presented. Who would you say is the more intelligent man? Who is willing to take more risks for his country? Who follows his morals - however much you may agree or disagree with them - more consequently? The US government in this film is actually very openly hypocritical. First they order the abduction of the president of Kazakhstan, then they are outraged when the same is done to them in return. First the president is willing to sacrifice all the hostages on board of the plane because ""ah don negotiate wit terroris'"", then he is willing to give in to all demands to save his wife and child - when before he did not care at all about other people's wives, children or husbands being killed.And the character of the president himself is so stereotypical it hurts. Every one of his actions is predictable. Same goes for his wife (""I don't know what you want! But you won't get it!"" Hellooo?). It is very difficult to be on their side, especially when on the other side the top terrorist makes statements that in 2009, after 8 years of Bush junior, countless proxy wars, several more US-backed coups and in the middle of another Iraq war, are probably much more popular than in the 90s. Maybe it's just Gary Oldman stealing the show, but maybe it's a subversive director who is way ahead of his time leading the embarrassing clichées of a genre ad absurdum (""red white and blue, I count on you"" - good thing the person who installed the cables was just as much into nationalistic kitsch as you are, Mister President).And then there's the scene where General Radek is released from prison and all the poor, downtrodden prisoners sing the Internationale from their small, dirty cells. It doesn't get much more epic than that. Way more striking than the long-winded rescue mission at the end of the film.So I thoroughly enjoyed watching the film but I watched it ""the other way round"". Watched as it seems to be (and, in all seriousness, probably is) the film is of course, apart from the usual racist and sexist undercurrents that the director probably didn't even notice he catered to, also a piece of embarrassingly shallow kitsch. But at the very least, it gave the bad guys a fair chance to make their point (before getting their asses kicked of course).(P.S.

It has a plot that at first glance could be interpreted as the set-up for a cheesy action movie, but in fact it actually works pretty well.The plot centres around the American President, played by Harrison Ford (Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Blade Runner). His plane, Air Force One, is hijacked by a group of terrorists, led by Gary Oldman (Harry Potter).Both Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman deliver some great performances. Gary Oldman is very terrifying as the leader of a group of terrorists, a tough, nasty man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, as shown by his method of persuasion: until the Government gives in to their demands, he will hold everyone aboard hostage and execute one of them every thirty minutes.Harrison Ford also delivers a fine performance as the President of the United States, a former soldier who finds himself trying to save everyone aboard the plane. The plot is very well-written. Most of the story takes place on an airplane, and as a result it has that strange claustrophobic element that is common in submarine movies.Overall this is a very good film, and I'd definitely recommend this film to anyone who enjoys suspenseful thrillers, or any fans of Harrison Ford.",Air Force One
254,maris1,Air Farce One,1,20 August 2008,"My god, I can't honestly believe there's someone who actually thinks this movie is to be taken seriously.I've been forced to give this movie a 1 because IMDb doesn't let me use a zero. This atrocious thing can be described with three words: insult to intelligence. Want me to be more specific? Here we go 1) the whole premise is stupid enough to make those who love this movie appear even dumber in comparison. The President, trapped inside the AFO with a bunch of Russian terrorists, grabs a gun and kills everyone, saving the day. If this doesn't make you smile, you must be some really mentally challenged person 2) the patriotism. I will never understand how a German director ends up being more patriotic than the most patriotic republican hillbilly, but this really sets a new standard: The President single handedly decimating an entire platoon of uber-trained Russian soldiers. The red, white, blue wires line. The teenage daughter smack-talking the Russian leader ""My father is a great man"", the American general ""The president will use his glove to send that Russian.."" etc. I could go on and on. It's a huge turn off when there's a large amount of US patriotism in some movies, but this one is actually built around that premise. Vomit inducing is the only way I can use to describe my feelings.3) action. Action is professionally directed, but dull. Photography is so bland and soft it looks like a TV movie, thus making everything look as if it were filmed in your living room.4) characters. Cardboard characters all around. The Russian dude is a joke, the VP is bland as hell, the President is so strong and invincible you'd actually think he was created in a lab, daughter is annoying, everyone else is totally shallow 5) inconsistencies. besides the already mentioned joke hijacking, we also have thousands of bullets shot and not one hitting the fuselage; people parachuting off the plane at insane height and speed with their hair barely moving; two Harriers unable to hit a plane unless they're 20 feet from it, and on, and on..final comment: if insane patriotism doesn't bother you; if uninteresting and insipid characters are your favourite meal; if dull and unexciting action is your game; if anti-climatic and ridiculously bad CGI ridden endings are your league; if you can go on with a list of inconsistencies, mistakes, crappy lines and horrible special effects and if you can't choose between this crap and a moltitude of GOOD and DECENT action movies then AFO is the movie for you.

But for me it was just fun to watch President Ford go through everything.  I think he did a fine job, and Gary Oldman has got to be one of the best actors around.  But actually, by way of acting, I thought that this was it for this film.  The rest of the cast seemed a little miscast, corny, out of place, stiff, or all of the above.The family bit at the end was small, but for me, effective.  Maybe I'm just a softy.  And then all the parts about defending the President - seems like an honorable thing to do, and we're led to believe that Harrison is a man worth honoring.  Just makes you wonder if it feels the same in real life.Here's something fun - watch the movie on DVD with the director's commentary.

This film crossed way over that line.The acting was average, the script unbelievable, and the actions of the main characters often stupid.  Harrison Ford's character is presented as a pretty smart, resourceful guy, but when he knocks out a terrorist in a fight, he not only fails to make sure he is secure, but leaves a loaded weapon behind with the terrorist.  Ridiculous.I cannot recommend the move, although I'll admit the special effects were quite impressive.  That's about all it had going for it.",Air Force One
271,bryedtan_02,A President we wished we had.,8,9 July 2003,"Wolfgang Petersons' film ""Air Force One"" is a terrific and entertaining action film. The movie tells the story of a US President and his family who is held hostage by radical hard-line Communist terrorist. The film reminds us of the Die-Hard like action movies in which this single hero tries to save innocent lives as best as he can. Harrison Ford gives a magnificent performance as the President who tries to do what is right no matter the risk of his life. He projects the image of a President we all wish we had who would even sacrifice his life for others. Ford's President appears as a mix of Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy all rolled into one. Gary Oldman is great as usual for his  performance as a terrorist. Oldman's performance is a large contrast to Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber in Die Hard in which Oldman's character is not driven by profit but by a notion that only violence is the only solution in life for he was a trained killer there exist no other alternatives for him he feels like his existence is threaten by a new world where rigid Stalinist doctrines is viewed as obsolete. Glen Close also deserves kudos for her performance as the Vice-President who remains steadfast loyal to the President no mater what the cost. True this film is Hollywood fantasy but it takes us to our imagination of a President which we could be proud of to the time of Presidents like Reagan, Roosevelt, Eisenhower, and Kennedy instead of Nixon, Carter, and Clinton.",Air Force One
272,IMDB-3064,It'll Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat,9,10 February 2004,I've seen this movie a number of times. I bought it on VHS and then again on DVD.

273,meldme,Pass The Sick Bag,1,14 July 2005,"Oh dear, oh deary me indeed. The fact that I did not stagger directly from the cinema in a suitably nauseated fashion, before the end credits of this jingoistic, back-slappy nonsense is in itself a testament to human willpower and endurance. Harrison Ford (in an unfortunate blemish on his career), plays the President of the good ol' US of A. His plane (the aforementioned Air Force One), is hijacked by a bunch of no-good villains, stereotyped to the hilt. Thus ensues a battle of wits and so on, between the 'goodies' and the 'baddies', until you-know-who wins through in the end. The sickening antics of Ford's servants, bodyguards, CIA members etc, as they dive heroically in front of bullets meant for the 'Pres', really are cringe-worthy, to say the least. The only noteworthy moment of genuine tension in the entire movie involves the hijackers ultimatum to kill an air hostess unless President Ford surrenders to them. Even then, Ford bravely cowers and skulks in the shadows until the poor girl is shot dead. All sympathy with the lead character is now as dead as the stewardess. The subsequent 'Brave' actions of Ford's servants are notably nauseating, as men hurl themselves in harms way, for 'freedoms sake' in melodramatic fashion. I like a 'Feelgood' movie, just like everyone else, but not one with such a banal, self-congratulatory tone as this. Yawn!",Air Force One

The camera work shows high production values and the sound is really neat but I think that adds to why it doesn't completely work.  Nothing worse then an expensive cheesy movie. Armageddon is the worst.  I can only enjoy it to make fun of it. It's a good movie to show off your system with but they got better movies on DVD for that now. Anyone want my DVD? Real cheap.

I mean nothing personally against Harrison Ford, I am just sick of seeing the likes of Bill Pullman and Kevin Kline saving the America which supposedly means saving the world.The only reason I watched this movie all the way through is to watch in anticipation of the president being hit as we all know the president would never receive a bullet let alone die.

The writers can be given a little credibility license can't they?) who must follow through with his pledge to not give in to terrorism in the face of a terrorist plane take-over.The villain is well played by Gary Oldman who is quite believable as a Russian radical hell-bent on releasing a political leader incarcerated with the help of the US.The action takes Ford throughout the plane, taking out the baddies one by one. The tension on the ground as the cabinet try and work out who should be in control is a little light, not really applying a strong sub-plot which might have been an extra twist at the end. The action is reasonably predictable but, hey, if it were any other way we would be miffed! I mean the President of the United States has to triumph after-all!The action is clean, the tension crisp, the characters enjoyable.

By casting an actor of such caliber as Harrison Ford (sorry Clint), Mr. Petersen finally got a star with enough drawing power to pull people in on his name alone.

I have seen very bad European ""arty"" movies and very good U.S. ones despite being a little bit of a mass market product. But Air Force One is a movie that breaks all records of low quality and standards.What really puzzles me is why on earth respectable, decent actors agree to play such idiotic characters in unbelievable stupid and over-budgeted productions. Of course I didn't expect to find an award-winning movie with such a gringo topic, but I did expect to have good acting with a fairly decent story, nothing fantastic but at least worthy of spending two hours watching. This was not the case.Ok, most of Hollywood movies go somewhere along these lines: democracy defenders and Beacons of the World (i.e. The U.S.)suffer some kind of attack by some crazy, fanatic, and perverted representative of the forces of Evil (i.e. anyone but the U.S.); although the good ones are outnumbered, outwitted and cornered by the evil ones, they always find a way to overcome the crisis and win. In summary any of George Bush's pot dreams. But, aside from the inherent comedy involved in such ideas, why spend valuable resources such as production money and top actor's salary if just a simple action hero and (good) digital special effects would do?
Poor story, poor acting, non-existent continuity or factual veracity in a single movie cannot be accidental. There must be a hidden significance, a conspiracy. Bring in Mulder and Scully, fast!The only thing that made me happy after watching this piece of truly American chedar was that I didn't pay to watch it at the cinema, but only spent the equivalent of less than USD2.00 for the second-hand VCD, though I still think I spent too much.

291,Jan_,"Et tu, Wolfgang?",1,21 September 2003,"Normally, I never bother going to the movies to see flicks of this type; hell, why should I as it is obvious that they'll appear on TV sooner or later. Come to think of it, I had to wait 6 years to see this...What we have here is a Petersen movie. Das Boot, In The Line Of Fire, anybody? Piloted by a heavyweight cast of Hollywood stars including Ford, Close, Oldman, etc., etc. I mean, you cannot go wrong with that lineup? ...or can you?Yes! After having watched ~30 minutes of this, I was struck by the sinister urge of writing the most abusive review ever. Folks - this is a movie from the year 1997, A.D. Anachronism of this sort belongs to the 70s/80s, not to the nineties; the worst kind of clichés and stereotypes displayed here instantly force you to recall flicks such as Red Heat, Rocky IV, the Bond movies that dealt with the Soviet regime, you name it. OK, so these had the excuse of being spawned to an era of political tensions. But how about this? A script that pits the US President (WTF?) against a gang of vicious Russian terrorists (Christ!)?Remarkably enough, none of the actors manages to deliver a good performance. I felt sorry for Ford, he looked like Leslie Nielsen. Was _this_character_ really what he discussed about with Bill Clinton at the dinner table? Oldman is even worse and that really made me sad, as I have always considered him one of the best actors around. My condolences to the people who sat at any of the movie theaters in Russia, forced to watch (and listen) Oldman reading out his manifesto (nonsense supposed to be ""ultranationalist`) with one of the most horrendous ""Russian"" accents heard since Dolph Lundgren opened his trap in Rocky IV. (""Yoo vill ceess yoor military eskort..."") Worse still, due to the thick English accent, the Russian that Gary and his henchmen speak does not even remotely sound Russian. Do NOT tell me that there weren't any real Russian actors available for the job. (And what's with that bloke who played the silly Soviet scientist in MacGyver running around and suddenly being a hardcore terrorist?) Heavy miscastings/performances and blatantly stereotypical characters sum up  the worst silver screen ridiculing of Russians I've ever witnessed :)Glenn Close is truly annoying (yet another unpleasant surprise), she really could have dropped that metallic, aggressive voice of hers. Oh, and every scene that involves the West Wing following the President's progress deserves extra ""credit"" for the worst overdramatization EVER. The feeling that someone would suddenly spring up and gasp the ""He's a MADMAN!"" line from Spy Hard was constantly almost palpable.The plot has nothing to it, really. There is no tension, no entertainment value, nothing. Hijackers shooting hostages - for heaven's sake, by now we have probably all seen Die Hard or Under Siege, why repeat all that? The rest consists mainly of the underperforming Oldman, ranting in his Anglorussian and the overperforming Ford, sneaking about and nailing one dead-stupid baddie after another, spouting daft Stallonean one-liners here and there(""I'm counting on you, red, white and blue"" or ""Get off my plane!""). The movie gradually gets cornier towards the end and the plot acquires even more laughable dimensions. (My favourite being the dreadful ""Parachuting Scene"" that probably defies every law of physics available and provides the viewer with some hearty laughs as the happily smiling staff people float across the blue screen). I lost count on how many ""brave US patriots"" (including the effete William H. Macy) willingly took a bullet for the superhuman President Ford in this movie. Why, God, why? And if there actually was any political message concealed here, one more complex than ""Do NOT mess with the US - yes, especially you, reds"" then I surrender, it was beyond me.Gah, I could rant and rave on forever, but what's the point? What I can say is that if you have somehow managed to miss the overacted, atrocious uberpatriotic piece of garbage that is Air Force One, consider yourself lucky. Clearly, this is THE stupidest picture given the green light to. Well done, Hollywood, congrats, Wolfgang. 1/10 (1 point for the unparalleled amusement value).",Air Force One

The production begins with USA President James Marshall (Harrison Ford) on a visit to Russia to be honored by the arrest of the dictator of Kazakhstan, Radek (Jürgen Prochnow), however, during his speech, he criticizes the behavior of your country, because of bureaucracy and diplomacy, watched passively the dictator of Kazakhstan explore and kill his own people. When the president and his family get in the Air Force One to return to the USA, a Radek supporter group of the terrorist led by cruel Ivan Korshunov (Gary Oldman) takes control of the presidential plane and demanded the release of dictator. Otherwise, he will kill the wife and daughter of the president, who is in a terrible dilemma, because if cede negotiate with terrorists and deny what he preached, while deciding not to negotiate may see your family being murdered. With a beautiful and exquisite soundtrack in the first minutes of the film, which exalts American patriotism and reflects the hope and freedom, Air Force One introduces us - after the operation of prison of Radek - a discourse against terrorism and the promise of radical change in politics, made by USA President James Marshall. But it is after boarding the President and his family to the Air Force One that the action and the story starts to develop. Minutes after takeoff, the Russian terrorist Ivan Korshunov and his group take control of the plane and make everyone on board hostage. However, those loyal to Radek not know is that James Marshall did not leave Air Force One through the escape pod, but remained on the aircraft to save his family. Filled with ironic and critical dialogs regarding the current political and mode of action of rulers on terrorism, the film strikes hard the bureaucratic model before a dangerous situation and even day-to-day lives of citizens. Besides the clash between Marshall and Korshunov, representing radicalism for democracy and the struggle to establish peace, respectively. Air Force One also highlights the power struggle between Vice President Kathryn Bennett (Glenn Close) and the Defense Secretary Walter Dean (Dean Stockwell), wondering if Marshall is still able to perform his job, Walter tries to convince Kathryn sign a petition declaring Marshall unable to govern, thus dismissing the USA presidency. Attached to it, there criticism of the press and media in discrete scenes and intelligent dialogs. Of course, I can't forget of leave a comment for the talented cast with Harrison Ford, Gary Oldman, Glenn Close and William H. Macy that give brightness to the screen with its clean and elegant performances. Harrison Ford is fabulous as the USA president, pose with peaceful and diplomatic, but at the same time willing to fight for what he believes, the actor conveys the sense of justice and commitment. Gary Oldman no comments... The British is magnificent in his portrayal of a fanatic and cynical terrorist, his mere presence causes chills and their violent actions leave the viewer tense and not knowing your next step. Glenn Close is beautiful and elegant as the vice president and faithful to Marshall who seeks tranquility to the people. After watching Air Force One you can be sure that Harrison Ford should be the USA president.I BELIEVE IN HARRISON FORD!",Air Force One
310,sajonzinger,Excellent Film,9,10 May 2005,"This film painted an exceptional portrait of the American spirit, pitching Harrison Ford as the president of the United States and Gary Oldman as a Russian terrorist hijacking Air Force One. Harrison Ford played his part excellently and Gary Oldman was a very convincingly evil villain.The whole premise of refusing to negotiate with terrorists is one that I personally believe fully in, and agree with. The love that President Marshall holds for his family is refreshing, as well as his loyalty and commitment to his country.This movie is an emotional roller coaster, to say the least. There were several times during the movie that nearly bring you to tears showing the heartlessness and cruelness that the terrorists possess, but during the final half hour of the film, it uplifts the heart of any who watch it with it's picture of the American spirit. Jerry Goldsmith's score helped director Wolfgang Peterson realize that. If you say, as I have heard many say before, that the ending to this movie stinks, I have to question whether or not you really love your country. Personally, I thought the ending was the most uplifting movie ending I have ever seen.",Air Force One
311,rtaylor701,This presidential ride aboard Air Force One leaves viewers on the edge of their seats,9,29 March 2015,"""Air Force One"" starts out with the president of the United States in Moscow signing a no nonsense pact with the Russian premier in regards to dealing with terrorists. Harrison Ford, portraying the role of the president, has to soon wonder about his dealings as a group of Russian neo-nationalists have managed to hijack the presidential plane with him, his family, and other members of the government aboard. These hijackers desire the release from a Russian prison one of their central leaders in a coup against the current Russian premier and his government. With some discharge of weapons aboard the plane, and a few hostages killed, the suspense builds to a tension-filled ride. Finally, the president manages to turn the tide in his favor, but the plane, which was severely crippled in various systems, now has to piloted for a possible landing. And then, a traitor on board plays what could be a final card in this suspenseful game.Harrison Ford plays the president, Gary Oldman the leader of the terrorists, and other members of the cast include Glenn Close as the Vice President on the ground, William H. Macy as staff, Wendy Crewson as the president's wife, and Dean Stockwell as Secretary of Defense. All in all, a very good movie to view.",Air Force One

Some dumb gung ho pilot sacrificing himself to save the president from the 2nd missile that was fired in the 2 minute window. The bad guy at the end shooting everybody but giving Harrison Ford like 10 minutes to rescue himself....and not forgetting the ridiculous plane crash at the end.This film is just awful.

313,imperioaustrohungaro,Surreal,3,31 December 2018,"In the era of Donald Trump, a movie premised on the notion that the office of US President could be occupied by a quick-thinking, resourceful, physically brave hero comes across as frankly surreal. I like Harrison Ford, and am a sucker for all three of his facial expressions (you know: angry, quizzical and wryly relieved) but I can't think he's very proud of this. I guess it might go down well with seven-year-olds somewhere in the Mid-West, hence the (grudging) three stars. There are about two and half minutes of vaguely believable moments, if you add them all together, in the entire running time; the rest is comic book stuff.I only write this because the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that a send-up of this movie with a Trump clone in the role of President would make a brilliant comedy. In that version, of course, instead of firing shots at each other, the characters would all be breathlessly tweeting.""It's now or never. Mr President.

Disappointed due to the inconsistent plot, stereotype characters, etc. Well, it might have just been good up to the point where Gary Oldman had to go. In fact, that is my problem. What did he actually die of?Either way, what about all this happiness when the body count has been exceedingly high? Would you expect the press to react the way they do in the movie?And wouldn't we have a right to know why a US Agent becomes a traitor?Anyway, I might have set my standard too high.

319,imdb user,WARNING: SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS,7,28 August 2000,"WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS. That said, I would like to comment on the movie.  Despite its propaganda, its EXTREME unoriginality, as well as its predictable plot, the movie is entertaining, and a good killer of 2 hours.We have seen enough Die Hard rip-offs since 1988.  This movie does nothing less than take the plot as well as elements from that movie.  For example, the ending: In Die Hard, Gruber (our villain) had Holly (our hero's wife) at the edge of the building and was going to do something.  McClane (our hero) somehow kills Gruber and rescues his wife.  In AFO, Gary Oldman (our villain) had Wendy (hero's wife) at the parachute ramp at the rear of the plane.  Marshall (our hero) kills Oldman and rescues his wife in almost the same fashion as in Die Hard.  AFO included the taking of a hostage by the ""bad guys"" and using him or her to get the unknown hero to show himself. Like we haven't seen that before.  Then you can expect the hero, which for some strange reason happens to be the President of the United States (what the hell?), to make everything turn out fine in the end.Also, this movie makes the ""terrorists"" look bad,  yet I was rooting for them throughout the movie.  It's strange how when a non-American sacrifices the security of civilians to achieve certain aims he is labeled a ""terrorist,"" yet an American who does the same thing is a ""hero.""  This movie is chock-full of that kind of propaganda.  Don't expect the President to ever get seriously injured, either, because he's the President of the United States.  Oh, and make sure to keep your brain in a safe place other than your head, because you won't be needing it for the duration of this movie.Don't expect any plot twists.  That traitor guy (I didn't bother remembering his name) should've been kept secret until the end in order to add some suspense.  But nooooo, they *had* to show him doing his dirty work so we can all know who the mastermind behind the hijacking is, thereby ruining the whole element of surprise for us.(By the way, I told you there would be a lot of spoilers.  If you find yourself reading this, and you are about to kill me because I ruined the movie, too bad.  I warned you.)How could the White House secretary not recognize the President's voice? When Marshall was calling for some Russian guy to come down and get the body, why didn't the Russian guy recognize that this was not an authentic Russian accent?  There are too many flaws with this movie that I cannot list them here.In short- don't get me wrong, this movie is worth a rental.  But only if you can't find anything else, and you are EXTREMELY bored.  DON'T bother buying this movie, though.",Air Force One
320,Pasel,Review of a film about the dangers of flying,7,26 December 2000,"First I want to say that the film isn't like other Petersen Movies, there are less things to think about in it but some more action.That makes the film more interesting for more people but it isn't Petersens style. I even saw ""Das Boot"" and ""In the line of fire"" and so a picture of Petersen formed in my head.This film breaks it. But I don't want to say the movie is bad.There is hard action and good dramatic scenes (especially the showdown).The story about a very very brave President is just unbelievable (I can't imagen Bill Clinton or now George W. Bush running through a large airplane and killing hijackers.Sorry.) So in the end a good film for sitting down in the armchair at the evening but no film which will stay in the heads of the watchers.",Air Force One
321,bjorn.grung,"Come back, Jack Ryan!",3,11 September 2000,"Below average hostage/hijacking/political thriller.Looking at the cast, one would expect this movie to be worthy of one's time. Harrison Ford, Gary Oldham, William H. Macy, Dean Stockwell, Glenn Close - names that should amount to a watch-worthy experience. However, the movie falls short on all accounts.Warning: This comment contains minor spoilers.A poor man's version of the Jack Ryan series. Harrison Ford plays the role of president Marshall, on board the USAF1 which gets hijacked by Kazakh terrorists. Having recently given a speech on his new Just Say No-politics towards terrorists, negotiations appear to be out of the question. Not all of his government and staff agree on this, however.This could have made an interesting movie. The tension in the White House, when faced with the fact that it is the country's leader who is taken hostage, combined with the political intrigues that arise in such a situation, should have been exploited further. Instead, we are treated with the traditional gung-ho blazing guns solutions where one man saves the day. We've seen it a million times before, and a hundred times better.
Even the special effects are highly ordinary. A lot of them are clearly computer generated, and it is a let-down when it becomes this visible. Better airplane fighting scenes were filmed 40 years ago.
Every cliché appears, even the amazing ""fighting inside an airplane with a big hole in its side, without being sucked out into thin air"" scene.
Some enjoyment can be had from trying to find the most stupid scene. My favorite: Look for the parachuting secretary with a happy smile on her face, 15000 feet above sea level, wearing only a thin blouse.
From the acting, it seems that the actors are aware that this is not the movie they will be rememvered by. Particularly disappointing is Gary Oldham on autopilot, as the one-dimensional villain. Ford ditto, as the good guy.
While it is reassuring to see that the American president saves the day yet again, not even the casting crew stars can save this film. In the computer world, GIGO means Garbage In, Garbage Out. It applies here as well. Spend more money on the manuscript next time, Mr. Petersen.Avoid: 4/10",Air Force One
322,phantomdan13,"Hmmm, a tad predictable maybe ?",4,25 October 2001,"*Spoilers* this film was over for me from the second the plane got hijacked. The story just had no flexibility. It was obvious that the writers weren't gonna kill off the president, so right from the start we knew he was gonna handle the situation alright. Plus, with this kind of hollywood schlock, you also knew they would never kill off the Presidents family, which admittedly could have made for a good film, giving the president something harsh to deal with emotionally. As film making goes, this was't a badly made film, it was a bad story. The directing is the kind that fades nicely into the background. Nothing new or experimental, but nothing so bad as to make you notice it, just average, it did what it needed. Then, the scenes from The Whitehouse! C'mon! The emergency meetings at the Whitehouse were pulled off more realistically in Austin Powers! THe military general who wants to blow up everything that moves, the cool and collected woman. Has anyone heard a of a ""stereotype"" ? Overall, this movie could have been worse, I gave it a 4. It redeemed itself with the 'decent' (note lack of enthusiasm) performances of the Terrorists.

326,bbqplatypus_318,"Entertaining, If a Tad Implausible, Die-Hard-On-a-Plane Film",7,25 October 2008,"I literally just finished watching this movie on DVD, and I have to say, it was everything it should have been. Seeing as how the movie involved the President of the United States, I'm almost certain that the IMDb boards are filled with heated political discussions (likely including Europeans chastising Americans for being so stupid). While those arguments may have a place on the Internet, that place is not here. Because this is not a political film - all it is is an entertaining Die Hard knockoff starring Harrison Ford. If you go in thinking about it that way, you'll enjoy this movie a lot.While the premise (and some other parts of the film) range from a bit out-of-the-ordinary to out-and-out implausible, the action sequences and the taut pacing make up for these issues by making the movie a lot of fun to watch, which is what every action movie should strive for. Gary Oldman is damn good as the main antagonist, and I must say that I found his grievances against the United States (and admiration for the despotic general that he wants freed) to be quite believable.On a lighter note, there should be more films where we get to see the President of the United States shooting at people. That would be awesome. Escape from New York has nothing on this movie in the ""Presidents carrying guns department.""

Without even going into how bad the plot and special effects are, one thing is worse then anything else.6 MIG29s are behind Air Force One for over two minutes. Only two of them fire missiles. Each MIG29 is equipped with 4 air-to-air RR77 missiles that have a minimum range of 30 miles. They could have fired all those missiles from farther ahead long time before they got to the plane. So first question is why didn't they fire more missiles? Why only one missile and then wait 5 more minutes to fire another one so F15 could get in a way and die for it? And then we have 6 F15 that fire their missiles all at the same time toward MIGs. Anyone who knows anything about these jets would now that MIGs SPO system (system that tells pilot he has been locked on by enemy fighter) would have picked up those missiles from F15 long time before. Actually, everything that I wrote doesn't even have to be said because at such small distance between fighters, it is Impossible to use missiles. Only guns would be able to be used. Missiles are absolutely useless at such small distances.

I wonder why any TV program director in any country but the US would stoop as low as to show this brainwashing session - but obviously they've lost all self-respect, otherwise I would NEVER have seen this movie.I keep reading these ""yeah, it's stupid, but so much fun"" comments. How on earth can you enjoy something that is this inane? I just can't understand how anyone could effectively disable that part of the brain that makes you cringe at stupidity and enjoy what's left.

The movie is just an excuse for mindless action and actors delivering over-macho lines to each other. It reminds me somewhat of ""True Lies""...but that was a comedy, right?

The hijacking of the President's aircraft by terrorists posing as Russian media was difficult to believe. That six people would be able to carry off such a feat, given the number of secret service agents that travel with the president, is highly unlikely. That hundreds of rounds from automatic weapons and large-caliber handguns could be fired on board an aircraft without affecting any critical systems is debatable. That terrorists could blow the cockpit door open, using some sort of plastic explosive, detonating it by firing a pistol at it (hitting it on the first shot, no less!), yet not injure the pilots or cause any damage to the flight deck is astonishing. When they managed to take control of the plane during landing, perform several off-road maneuvers with the plane that would make a Jeep proud, then get a Boeing 747 airborne again without benefit of a runway, that's when I went Popeye and decided I'd had all I could stand and I could stand no more.I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next guy, but this was just asking too much.I won't even go into the cheesy script and listless acting.

350,allly_andrews,Blasterrific!!!!,10,13 July 2006,"Some movies are bad. Some are good. And some are more that amazing, that it's a shame movies are fantasies and not real life. The first time I watched AFO was way back, in 2002. Since then, I saw the movie other four times, but I didn't get bored, not even for a second. This film is so entertaining, that I'm sure I'll watch it over and over again. (And so should you!)Released in July,1997, AFO flew high, rapidly becoming a summer blockbuster, earning some 315 million dollars. And it's surely worth this money: despite some minor flaws here and there, the movie is superbly crafted. It has all the ingredients for a blockbuster: popular cast, great director,cool story and amazing special effects.Director Wolfgang Petersen did a great job, mixing action and suspense in ideal quantities and adding just a bit of drama to make the story more convincing.The plot line is great, absolutely breathtaking. It goes like this: a commando team, formed out of American and Russian soldiers, capture General Ivan Radek. Three weeks later, the American President goes to Russia and holds an outstanding speech against international terrorism. On the way home, Russian terrorists devoted to Radek hijack Air Force One in order to demand the release of the general. Bodyguards try to save the President; they take him to the escape pod and jettison him. So they think. In fact, the President is still on board, angrier and meaner than ever, ready to fight against international terrorism. Many say this story is improbable,even more,impossible. Hello people! Because the presidential plane hasn't been hijacked yet, you can't blame the entire movie that it's impossible. And because we can't imagine Bush fighting with his bare hands with some (spoiler) bad-ass terrorists doesn't mean that the President should be a chicken. But why do some humans care so much about reality, as long as we're talking about movies? Movies are fantasies, they're unreal, that's why people call them ""movies"". Their purpose is not to show reality, it's to transmit us messages or to show us what's good, and what's bad.Leading actor, Harrison Ford, does a great job playing the (spoiler) ass-kicker President, James Marshall. I'm sure if Kevin Costner had accepted the leading role, this movie wouldn't have been as good as we know it. Ford does an outstanding performance being a father, a husband, a world leader and a Medal of Honour winner from the Vietnam war. When terrorists seize the presidential plane, the Commander-in-Chief proves to be one heck of an adversary, killing the bad guys one by one. But don't get me wrong: he's not a Dolph Lundgren-like killing machine; he's just trying to save his family and his employees from imminent death. Also, is it me or Ford looked as cool as ever in AFO? He was such a charismatic leader, and such a loving family man (although in real life, he left his kids and his wife, Mellisa Mathison, after 17 years of marriage)that it's a shame he's not the Commander-in-Chief. Also, I found out that Ford was really interested in this movie. He went with director Petersen and some other men to Andrews AF Base, to take a look inside one of the planes. But Clinton, who was with them, almost fined them, because they would have liked to see the jet's undercarriage.The other actors also did a great job. Gary Oldman is one mean, ruthless, Communist terrorist. He threatens the White House that he will kill a hostage at every half an hour, until his demands are made real. And he also lends his character, Egor Korshunov, a part of his intriguing insanity. You should surely be out of your minds, in order to hijack the plane carrying the American Prez, risking the outbreak of World War III. Glenn Close also does a cool performance, depicting the Vice President. Although she's at the White House, far away from the mid-air combat, she has to make some crucial decisions-like firing a heat-seeking missile towards Air Force One, which will not hit the plane, but shake it strongly, all this in order to help Prez Marshall defeat one of the terrorists. I could also detect a slight care towards the President (attention, First Lady!). Convincing roles are also those of Wendy Crewson and Liesel Matthews, a.k.a the wife and daughter of the President, William H. Macy-Major Cadwell, and Dean Stockwell-Defense Secretary Walter Dean. Here are 2 thumbs down:the film's casting took people into lots of confusion. ""Egor Korshunov"" became ""Ivan Korshunov"" and ""Ivan Radek"" became ""Alexander Radek"". Another complaint is a plot hole left unsolved:we do not find out why Agent Gibbs turned against Washington and allied with the terrorists. Maybe it was money, maybe it was brainwash.But the special effects are really good: Extender 1-0 exploding in mid air, the President hanging out of Air Force One etc. all these scenes are simply breathtaking and nail-biting. Air Force One crashing into the Caspian Sea is also a well-made scene, even though the plane seems to cruise a bit slow and the water looks like concrete. You might take into consideration that way back,in 1997, Pentium II computers had just arrived.The soundtrack made by Jerry Goldsmith is awesome and helps you feel the intense suspense throughout the movie. It's an incredible job, if you think that the music had to be composed in just 2 weeks.And a major thumbs up for something:the nuclear code issue is solved in a fine way. In the end, I tell you all: if you like good action movies,if you're H.F. fans or if you can take the credit that films are fantasy and not real life, go and watch AFO. And if you've already watched it, watch it again. I give it a 10 out of 10 for outstanding performance and for the incredible entertainment it offers to the public.",Air Force One
351,EllieODonnell,a darn good action film,8,2 September 2008,(me and my dad watch a lot of action/adventure films but this one is a complete legendary classic.)I would recommend it to anyone who likes a bit of good old fashion cheese topped action...I think that Harrison Ford is a great as non-stop-terrorist-kicking-silver-haired-action-hero- president but my favorite character is his daughter whose wise words at the end are incredibly cute.The clever turns in the story make it more interesting than your average modern action movie and it is much more satisfying!WATCH IT!,Air Force One
352,pipipooper,EXTREMELY underrated movie,10,23 December 2020,"One of the best action thrillers ever made.
This Movie is awesome. Amazing action scenes, great story, incredible acting by Harrison Ford, Glenn close, Gary Oldman and everybody else and outstanding Direction by Wolfgang Peterson. It is Accompanied by a great soundtrack by Jerry goldsmith. (he also did the soundtrack for stuff like alien, Star trek TMP and TNG and some of the Rambo movies.) Without a doubt this is MY favorite movie. Now, it is pretty violent, so definitely not for everyone, so watch out for that, but if your fine with gunshots, WATCH. THIS. MOVIE. The only thing that isn't the best is the cgi, but it was 1997, so I justify that. If you like Die hard-esque movies, this one's for you. Same goes for anyone who likes action movies. Great movie, go watch it.",Air Force One
353,tasosN,Movie industry's lowest point,1,19 December 2001,"This is the most incredibly idiotic piece of junk that has ever been filmed. It is impossible to ignore the obvious political message and focus on any other aspect, by saying it was ""fun"" ( which it wasn't ) or ""well made"" ( the special effects were below the 80's level, but I guess something had to give to make up for Ford's paycheck ).So you have a story where all Americans are pictured as heroes and righteous people while on the other side all foreigners are either lunatics, idiots, cheaters and generally untrustworthy. On top of it all stands the President, who apart from being a model statesman and family man, he also posseses the skills to singlehandedly dispose of a group of trained commandos, quite aside from such everyday skills as flying jets and speaking Russian ( and all this filmed in complete seriousness, without a trace of irony or parody to help redeem it ). It is unbelievable, a film like that would have been ridiculed even in Hitler's Germany or Stalin's Russia, to say nothing of the America of the 50's up to the 80's. But now we have people who actually come out of the movie theater saying that such a provocatively idiotic product was fun to watch, and Harrison Ford was really cool. A true shame.",Air Force One
354,bobperlman,Excellently acted & portrayed. Slightly futuristic but believable.,10,18 May 2002,"A1 acting and casting.  Story-line excellent but slightly unbelievable as to the ""special effects"", such as the escape capsule.  Highly rated, nonetheless.  Harrison Ford, as per his norm, does a magnificent and highly believable job in his portrayal of the President - Some day we might have a president that is so action-oriented - but I doubt if we would in my lifetime.",Air Force One
355,orion34-1,"Brilliant comedy, crappiest action movie",1,11 October 2002,"The times of the cold war have gone a long time ago, so why chew on this subject in the very end of the 20th century? Some people seem to be unaware of this fact. What surprises us is that among these people are actors that are famous and respected in the whole world, and also that this horrible movie has eaten so much money and it's being sold as an action movie. This movie is the reincarnation of Rocky III (& alike movies from the cold war era) idea, where Rocky (Stallone) was chasing enemy tanks on a horse :)
Harrison Ford is a good actor, but they forgot to warn him that this movie is a joke, and he took it too seriously - which makes him look ridiculous. (Maybe it would have been a good idea to invite Eddie Murphy instead?). It's understood that some Americans would like to see Indiana Jones (or Swarzenegger, or Stallone) as their president :) Even though Gary Oldman is known for playing bad guys, this time he did a bad job - he has nothing in common with Russians. Sorry Gary, we know you have very good brains and lots of decent offers, guess your agent didn't read the script carefully and when you realized how bad it was, there was no turning back.....We laughed our asses off hearing those presumably Russian characters and trying to understand what they were saying. Actually the only Russian actor who spoke perfect Russian (he said two words!) was killed in the very beginning :) Big mistake :) And during the rest of the movie we were reading the English translation being unable to get through horrible American accents of the ""Russians"".President Petrov is as funny as if the American president was called John Smith :)From our Russian point of view, it's a surprise that this movie wasn't prohibited here in Russia. Well, looks like our country has more freedom and sense of humour :) We are happy that we watched this movie on the TV and didn't spend a single ruble on buying or renting it (just lost 2 hours of our time), otherwise we would have been sorry. Actually we don't really regret spending our time, it's been a long time since we laughed that much on a movie that wasn't meant to be a comedy :)P.S. No offense meant towards America and Americans, we've read other people's comments and it's obvious that most of them share our point of view.

I probably didn't get the point of this film?? It is full of clichés, full of flaws and often I felt just embarrassed. President of the US fights professional killers and outsmart them all alone... ha ha. I have to admit that I was not able to watch this till the end.Maybe I wasn't in the mood for that kind of movie.

358,jakob_englund,laughable..,2,4 May 2006,"I was thinking about writing just ""laughable"" but then I changed my mind. This movie is so ridiculous and almost propagandistic that I even find it hard to laugh AT it. The one thing that bothered me the most was the portraying of the president as some sort of superhuman that not only is the most powerful man on earth but also is a loving devoted family father and a courageous hero who, risking his own life, pulls mind boggling stunts in order to beat the hijackers. OK! I know that you've got to be an A+ person to become president of the U.S (with exception for G.W.B) but this is too much! Harrison Ford is a respectable actor but only god knows why he made a blunder such as this one. There is one good thing about this movie though, the stunts! But that's it.

360,denesdobai,2 stars...,2,19 September 2019,The only thing I watched this movie because Gary Oldman in it. He's good but not brilliant as usual. Otherwise the whole story/movie is terrible,Air Force One
361,Alvsy007,It is what it is......fun,6,7 March 2005,"Nonstop action, thrilling suspense, dark humor, and a brilliant concept, this flag waving over the top action adventure was a good two hours in 1997.The story: Enroute back to the States from Russia, Russian Nationals hijack the President's plane and hold him and his family (as well as most of his staff) hostage aboard Air Force One in order to release a Rouge General captured earlier.Harrison Ford from his first minute to his last looks comfortable in his Presidential role. That's to say, Ford appears, acts and just plain feels like he should be President. (Come one who saw this movie and wanted him to run). Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain (Ivan) should be up there with the likes of Alan Rickman's Hans from Die Hard and John Malkovich's Leary-Booth-Carney from In the Line of Fire (coincidentally directed by Wolfgang Peterson as well). Glenn Close pulls of the Vice President role with smirks and spunk.Stars aside I think the supporting cast should get an equal if not harder pat on the back. These guysand girls. really made the movie. They're the ones that brought the chuckles and caused gasps. Wendy Crewson (The Good Son) nailed her role with more grace than a first lady has actually shown in the last recallable years. Paul Guilfoyle (""CSI"", The Negotiator), was the kind gentle, ""best buddy"", chief-of-staff, who brought a small smile to your face every time he is on-screen. Xander Berkeley (""24"", Terminator 2), plays the chilling secret service agent Gibbs. The lovable William H. Macy plays the good-mannered Air Force Officer who puts himself in harm's way for the President more time than the Secret Service agents do. He just doesn't get enough screen time toward the beginning. And Dean Stockwell will have you cussing under your breath as the power-hungry Secretary of Defense. And it seems that Wolfgang Peterson watched every great Action/Military movie of the past 3 years and hired all those ""briefing room generals"". For this I applaud him. As for the terrorist, they rival those of Die hard. Cold, stone-faced, funny, smooth, and just plain hateable, they did their job.The bulk of the movie takes place aboard the Air Force One no kidding eh?). And boy do you believe it. The production designer (Williams Sandell) obviously paid attention to detail, mimicking the real Presidential Aircraft. Small, claustrophobic and believable.Andrew W. Marlowe's script gets it job done as well. Nothing award winning. It's everything you would expect given the story it has to tell. Couple times it will make you cringe, but again, look what it needs to accomplish.The late Jerry Goldsmith's score for this movie is a hands down classic. Only having two weeks to score the film after Peterson rejected Randy Newman's work, Goldsmith with the help of Joel Mcneely composed one of the most bombastic, riveting, emotional, suspenseful, and patriotic scores I've heard come out of the film world. It works perfectly with the movie.A few times your mind is going to be stretch you may have to resort to the ""It's just a movie"" mindset. Overall its fun. Not a bad way to spend 2 hours.

366,mss155,Very intense and fun!,9,2 June 2006,This was one of the best films I have ever seen. This film is full of great drama and intense action. Harrison Ford does a great job of portraying an American president the way we would all like him to be. Good character and not afraid to stand up to the bad guys. What I'm finding makes a really great film is the existence of a great evil character for the good guys to fight. The Green Goblin from Spiderman 1 comes to mind. This film delivers that on many levels. There are some very nasty characters in this movie. These bad guys who gain access to Air Force one make for some gut wrenching scenes at times. One of the fun things about this movie was the constant ups and downs you have to endure as the presidents plane is attacked and controlled by terrorists. I've watched Air Force One many times and I always get emotional. The films plot has taken on a whole new meaning since 911. I highly recommend it and I know you will enjoy it!,Air Force One

The hijacking of the President's aircraft by terrorists posing as Russian media was difficult to believe. That six people would be able to carry off such a feat, given the number of secret service agents that travel with the president, is highly unlikely. That hundreds of rounds from automatic weapons and large-caliber handguns could be fired on board an aircraft without affecting any critical systems is debatable. That terrorists could blow the cockpit door open, using some sort of plastic explosive, detonating it by firing a pistol at it (hitting it on the first shot, no less!), yet not injure the pilots or cause any damage to the flight deck is astonishing. When they managed to take control of the plane during landing, perform several off-road maneuvers with the plane that would make a Jeep proud, then get a Boeing 747 airborne again without benefit of a runway, that's when I went Popeye and decided I'd had all I could stand and I could stand no more.I can suspend my disbelief as well as the next guy, but this was just asking too much.I won't even go into the cheesy script and listless acting.

I got goosebumps when the ""traitor"" was still there, waiting for the moment when Harrison Ford would give the traitor exactly what he deserved. This movie had great effects and nail biting action scenes. It was interesting to see Glenn Close in a different kind of role from her usual eccentric self. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because the outside of the plane blue screen was a little off and it bugged me. But hey it was made in 1997, today's effects are much less noticeable.
