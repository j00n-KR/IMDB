0,SnoopyStyle,"Too Unlikeable, No Joy",4,2 September 2013,Noah Griffith (Jonah Hill) is a college student on suspension. He is coaxed into babysitting the three kids next door. He is unprepared for the wild night ahead of him. He gets called by his girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor) and gets entangled with a crazed drug dealer (Sam Rockwell).This is sorta like 'Adventures in Babysitting (1987)' except it's more mean-spirited. Sam Rockwell plays a bad guy that's way too silly. Jonah is way too unlikeable. There just isn't any joy in this movie. The jokes doesn't really work either. There is a couple of good scenes but it is too unlikeable.,The Sitter
1,nogodnomasters,NOAH IS A HOT NAME,6,24 July 2018,"The movie starts out as a bad sex comedy. Jonah Hill stars as Noah Griffith, a slightly nerdy, obese young adult who peddles a bicycle. In the opening scene he is performing oral services for a pretty blond girl (Ari Graynor) who believes fat guys do it best, however she won't return the favor as she claims she has a touch of food poisoning. She is a coke slut loved by Noah.Mom (Jessica Hecht) coerces Noah into babysitting for the neighbor (Erin Daniels). The kids are a 13 year old boy with responsibility issues, an eight year old girl going on 16, and an adopted kid from El Salvador who acts like he is part of a cartel. Noah is irresponsible as this turns into an ""Adventures in Babysitting"" adult comedy as he attempts to score some cocaine for his ""girlfriend"" who has promised him real sex in return.As I watched the movie for the first time, I had the feeling I have seen this before. Predictable, trite, and mostly unfunny. A ""me-too"" comedy. A lower tier rental at best. Go watch Harold and Kumar instead.F-bomb, sex talk, no nudity",The Sitter
2,kosmasp,Bad Sitter,7,9 June 2012,"While I'm not a fan of titles being changed in Germany, this one should have been the original title. I'm sure Bad Santa wouldn't have a problem with that. But Jonah Hill goes from this to his awesome performance in Moneyball? You wouldn't expect that, but the man has talent. This movie is really funny too. And while I am not a fan of watching trailers of movies beforehand, this time it didn't take away too much from the movie (not to mention that there is scene in the trailer, that didn't make the theatrical cut).Jonah is surrounded by kids and they all have their moments. And while it is anything but PC, it also has its really emotional moments. Most of them may be predictable, but the way it is executed and played really works for the movie and the audience.",The Sitter
3,tavm,The Sitter was quite funny as raunchy comedies go,7,15 December 2011,"After seeing all the movies I had already wanted to watch with my movie theatre-working friend the past week or so, I let him rope me into reluctantly seeing this what I'm sure would be a low comedy-groaner. In this one, Jonah Hill is a college dropout who's trying to survive his existence of living with his single mom with occasional sexual favors to his ""girlfriend"". Then he ends up having to babysit a bunch of dysfunctional kids when the scheduled one bows out. I'll stop there and just say that I found the whole thing quite funny in a raunchy way with some touching moments that didn't seem tacked on for me. So on that note, The Sitter wasn't too bad as raunchy comedies go. So yeah, that's a recommendation.",The Sitter
4,zardoz-13,Incredibly Hilarious Fish-Out-of-Water Comedy,10,12 December 2011,"Comedian Jonah Hill usually plays a goof-off in a group of guys. He appeared in director Judd Apatow's ""Knocked Up"" as well as ""Funny People."" Although Hill took top billing in ""Superbad,"" Michael Cera attracted the lion's share of attention in that Judd Apatow produced teen comedy. Hill shared the screen with Russell Brand in another Judd Apatow produced laffer ""Get Him to the Greek,"" but Brand dominated that comedy with his hopelessly eccentric persona. Now, in ""Pineapple Express"" director David Gordon Greene's ""The Sitter,"" Jonah Hill plays top dog. Not only does he star as the protagonist, but he also is the butt of most of the humorous jokes. Anybody who has seen the wonderful Christopher Columbus comedy ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987) might notice the palatable resemblance between ""The Sitter"" and the former film. Freshman scribes Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka must have seen ""Adventures in Babysitting,"" too, because Gordon's film involves a similar sequence of events. Circumstances compel our reluctant hero to serve as a babysitter. Later, he finds himself caught up in an impossible predicament. Meaning, our hero must break rule number one of babysitting and leave the house. He must also break rule number two and take the children with him. Next, he breaks rule number three; he endangers their lives when he takes them in harm's way. The pay-off is that the kids learn some of life's harsh truths and experience a change in attitude about themselves. In fact, everybody, including the hero, learn something about themselves that they didn't know. The resemblance between the Chris Columbus movie and David Gordon Greene's movie ends at this point. ""Adventures in Babysitting"" qualified a mild PG-13 that skirted an R-rating, but kids and adults both can enjoy it. On the contrary, ""The Sitter"" deserves its R-rating for all of its profanity, sexuality, and intense situations. ""The Sitter"" is about the madcap misadventures of Noah Griffith (Jonah Hill of ""Accepted""), a college drop-out slacker living at home with his single mom. Noah is such a pathetic character that he doesn't own a car and has to pedal around on his bicycle to visit his whiny girlfriend Marisa Lewis (Ari Graynor of ""Mystic River"") who is on the rebound. Our selfish hero winds up helping out his mother, Sandy Griffith (Jessica Hecht of ""Sideways""), when he agrees to babysit three children for her. It seems that Sandy's dear friend Mrs. Pedulla (Erin Daniels of ""One Hour Photo"") has arranged a dinner date for her so Sandy can meet a bachelor surgeon. The backstory is that Noah's estranged father, Jim Griffith (Bruce Altman of ""Matchstick Men""), who is a wealthy diamond salesman, divorced Sandy and wrangled a legal way out of paying her alimony. In fact, Jim left Sandy because he was cheating on her with the girl who he hired to babysit Noah. Now, Sandy has a shot at finding a husband, but there is a catch. When Mrs. Padilla's regular babysitter contracts a urinary tract infection and cannot watch the kids, it looks like Pedullas will have to cancel the dinner date. Initially, Sandy tries to persuade Noah to substitute for the regular babysitter, but Noah objects. He argues that he is a grown man and grown men do not babysit. Noah realizes, however, that he is being self-centered and depriving his single mom of a chance to find happiness. The wild and chaotic evening which ensues is one of the most traumatic in Noah's life. Everything looks pretty simple until he encounters the Pedulla kids. First, 9-year-old Blithe (newcomer Landry Bender) wants to grow up to become a media 'celebutante ' like either Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan. She copious amounts of make-up. Second, Blithe's 13-year old brother Slater (Max Records of ""Where the Wild Things Are"") suffers from a sexual identity crisis. As a result, his psychiatrist keeps him heavily medicated. What Max refuses to recognize is he is a latent gay tendencies. The Pedulla's third child is an El Salvadoran refugee, Rodrigo (newcomer Kevin Hernandez) with an anger management problem. Whereas Slater is mild-manner and repressed, Rodrigo is a full-tilt anus who loves to toy with explosives. Rodrigo's favorite pastime is tossing cherry bombs into toilets. Rodrigo isn't happy because he keeps getting foisted off on one foster home after another because of his destructive antics.No sooner have the Pedullas and Noah's mom embarked on their dinner date than Marisa phones Noah. She informs him she is finally prepared to have sex with him if he can score some coke for a friend. Impulsively, Noah throws caution to the wind. He piles the Pedulla children into their mini-van and cruises into New York City with them to buy cocaine from a psychotic dealer, Karl (Sam Rockwell of ""Cowboys and Aliens""), who surrounds himself with muscle-bound bodybuilders. Rodrigo purloins one of Karl's prized dinosaur eggs packed with $10-thousand worth of coke. When Rodrigo and Noah tangle in a tug of war over the egg, they crack it and coke covers Noah's face. Later, a group of African-American gangstas steal the Pedullas' mini-van that Noah commandeered for their Manhattan melodrama. Now, Karl wants to ice Noah if our hero doesn't pay for the cocaine, and Noah still wants to hook-up with Maria. Essentially, ""The Sitter"" is a fish-out-of-water epic where characters find themselves off their home turf at the mercy of merciless minions. Everything that can go wrong for Noah does go wrong. Miraculously, he manages to keep his bacon from getting fried, but in the process winds up running an incredibly hilarious gauntlet. The dialogue is as memorable as the diverse characters are crazy. Mind you, this is neither the kind of movie that you should take a child to see nor is it the kind you should watch if you like to sympathize with the protagonist. Aside from our hero's mother and one of Noah's college friends, virtually every character in ""The Sitter"" is fairly obnoxious.",The Sitter
5,grantss,Silly,3,16 January 2014,"Silly. Had some great and funny lines, mostly by Jonah Hill, but these were few and far between. Most of the movie involves lurching anarchically from one stupid and overly contrived situation to another. Add in two of the most irritating kid-characters in the history of film and you have a recipe for extreme irritation.Not at all original. It's all been done before, and better. Very formulaic.Jonah Hill does the best he can with the lame script. His and Sam Rockwell's performances are the only highlights of the movie.Not a total miss, but there are plenty of better ways to spend 80 or so minutes of your time.",The Sitter
6,Boba_Fett1138,Doesn't exactly feature a likely or likable story.,5,3 June 2012,"All problems that this movie has aside, as long as a comedy can make me laugh, I'm fine with it. This movie however features far too little laughs in it, which is mostly due to the way the story is getting handled and the story itself of course.All of the events that happen in this movie are absolutely ridicules and don't make sense in the real world. It could had worked out, if the movie was taking a more absurd and over-the-top approach but the overall tone of the movie makes it seem as if the movie also wanted to still be taken serious. it really could had been a fun and adventurous comedy, in which things slowly got from bad to worse but now instead the movie feels very random.Things happen and are being taken for granted too easily in this movie. They besides come out of nowhere, making most of the movie work out as something annoying, rather than anything surprising or hilarious. And talking about surprising; everything in this movie progresses in a very predictable manner. You know how things shall eventually get wrapped up and how all of the character's story lines and their 'issues' will work out, by the end.Thing that this movie also suffers from are its kids. Sorry to say but most young children just aren't good actors. That goes for the child actors in this movie as well, though it perhaps is more fair to say that most of the blame for this should be put on its script. It lets them do and say some highly unlikely things, which never makes them feel like 'real' children.But I also don't really know how to feel about the Jonah Hill character. It's actually quite confusing, since he absolutely is supposed to be a sweet and mild guy but he does some absolutely despicable things in this movie and breaks about 10 different laws in the process and brings the young kids in trouble all the time. His character just isn't likable enough, though it was the clear intention to make a likable character out of him and let him carry the entire movie. And lets just analyze the story; its main premise is that the Jonah Hill is supposed to get drugs for his 'girlfriend', so he can finally have intercourse with her. This doesn't exactly sound like a story kids should be involved with, not even when it's a comedy and it also doesn't help to make the Jonah Hill a more sympathetic character.I don't really blame Jonah Hill. I actually quite liked him in his role, even though I really couldn't like his character. He obviously is a great actor, that also can handle comedy well but in this case his performance is suffering from its poorly written and handled script. Same goes for Sam Rockwell. I always love this guy and he still plays a pretty good character in this movie, that however deserved to be a part of a different and much better movie.It's still not the worst comedy you can watch but there also still is far too little to truly enjoy in this one.5/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Sitter
7,george.schmidt,Disappointing high-concept comedy homage to '80s 'babysitting' comedies ala UNCLE BUCK and ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING,7,5 January 2012,"THE SITTER (2011) ** Jonah Hill, Max Records, Ari Graynor, Landry Bender, Kevin Hernandez, Sam Rockwell, JB Smoove, Jessica Hecht, Bruce Altman, Erin Daniels, DW Moffatt, Reggie Alvin Green. Disappointing high-concept comedy homage to '80s 'babysitting' comedies ala UNCLE BUCK and ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING with slacker Noah Griffith (Hill, who also served as producer) meeting his match in the diminutive forms of his trio of charges and winds up in a memorably hellish evening involving the crazy girl (Graynor, seeming to have a cottage industry and the market covered with ditzy imbibing bimbos) he's 'involved' with and an off-beat drug dealer (Rockwell attempting to channel Joe Pantoliano's 'Guido the Killer Pimp' from RISKY BUSINESS). One-time indie flavor-of-the-month David Gordon Green may have attempted to tap into his inner John Hughes but the shaky screenplay by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka feels at best a first draft that somehow got greenlit. It doesn't help when producer Hill actually thinks the audience will buy another outlandish premise (the hottie – Daniels – falling for the slob) that feels half-baked at best.",The Sitter
8,neil-476,Poor,6,27 January 2012,"Tubby indolent loser Noah is prevailed upon to babysit three children who are as dysfunctional as he is. When he takes them out with him to buy some cocaine on the promise of sex from a girl who is leading him around by the nose, bad goes to worse, and then to even worse still. I went into this movie having been moderately amused by the trailer despite not liking Jonah Hill very much. I despise his obnoxious fat loser persona, and I find his ineffectual fat loser persona (of which Noah is another example) preferable: I found Get Him To The Greek quite comical. So I was open.The very first sequence finds Noah engaged in giving oral sex to the delectable Ari Graynor - she lets him do this because he is good at it, apparently, while she has no intention of returning the favour: she is still fixated on an ex-boyfriend, but she leads Noah along and uses him. I found this opening difficult to believe. On any basis whatsoever. Then I found the three babysat children unbelievable, especially the Salvadorian child with a penchant for blowing up toilets. Then I found... well, nearly everything unbelievable, quite frankly.Films are predicated on the suspension of disbelief. The minute I walk into a cinema I am more than halfway there. But from time to time a movie comes along which asks too much of me, and this is one of them. Nothing in it is credible. I know Jonah Hill has lost a lot of weight recently, but he is still round as a barrel in this one and, when the gorgeous Kylie Bunbury professed being tongue-tied about approaching and talking to him (and this after the opening sequence of him chowing down on Ms Graynor), I felt the movie was asking rather too much of me.It isn't a complete disaster. There are some chuckles here and there, and a touching (if unrealistic) moment between Noah and 13-year old Slater (which, unfortunately, had an air of Political Correctness to it).Not recommended.",The Sitter
9,ferguson-6,Make Love to the Night,3,11 December 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. Seeing more than 100 new movies every year means strict adherence to the ""gut instincts"" policy of deciding which new movies to see, and which to avoid. A day after the beat down of ""Shame"", I was desperate for laughter, so I ignored the gut instinct and headed out to see this new comedy. Unfortunately, my gut was correct, and I am still seeking laughter.David Gordon Green also directed Pineapple Express and Your Highness, neither my style, but both clearly comedies. Jonah Hill has quite the track record of comedy films (Cyrus), and earlier this year made his first foray into drama with ""Moneyball"". He has also recently lost a tremendous amount of weight, so this was to be his final ""fat guy"" comedy.If you have seen the far-superior ""Adventures in Babysitting"" (1987) with Elisabeth Shue, then you know the basic premise. Hill does his mother a favor by agreeing to babysit her friend's three kids. This proves more challenging than Hill's character expected. The kids are Slater, played by Max Records (Where the Wild Things Are); Blithe, played by Landry Bender; and Rodrigo, played by Kevin Hernandez. The kids, of course, have various afflictions, phobias and disorders ... but none as off the charts as Hill's character.Without going into detail, the first scene is horrible and the movie somehow proceeds to get worse from there. There is bathroom humor, a run in with a drug dealer (Sam Rockwell), a bitchy girlfriend (Ari Graynor) and a confrontation with a group of African Americans featuring Method Man. Every scene is predictable and generated no laughter from me or hardly anyone else in the theater. I always say that comedies are most difficult genre to review, because everyone has a unique sense of humor ... but this one just offers so very little.",The Sitter
10,anaconda-40658,Sit On This Film and Take a Dump.,2,9 March 2016,"The Sitter (2011): Dir: David Gordon Green / Cast: Jonah Hill, Max Records, Ari Graynor, Sam Rockwell, J.B. Smoove: This is not the year for David Gordon Green. First he directed the misfire fantasy fart fest Your Highness. Now he is stuck with his second embarrassing failure. This is a vulgar comedy about responsibility as Jonah Hill is stuck babysitting three brats. These kids are beyond real. One needs more pills for anxiety than viewers may require for watching this sh*t. The girl wears more makeup than a drag queen and uses language best reserved for traffic jams. The third is an adopted Mexican kid who blows up toilets with cherry bombs. We are suppose to laugh at the so-called cuteness and accept the lame resolution where understanding is met even after an evening of chaos. Hill survives the material because perhaps we can understand his anguish. The children are a pitiful unsympathetic bunch that come across as a kick to the crotch to sensible parenting. Ari Graynor plays the sleazy tramp whom Hill wants to lay and will stoop to going on a drug quest with the kids in the car just to impress. Sam Rockwell was brilliant in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. How unfortunate that he get reduced to playing a flamboyant drug dealer who stores drugs in dinosaur egg containers. Green will always have The Pineapple Express as a positive film on his resume, but that doesn't make up for the two piles of sh*t he makes for 2011. While locations are about as ambitious as this junk gets, its message is lost within its disgusting sense of comedy. It is a film that should sit in a trash bin. Score: 2 ½ / 10",The Sitter
11,FlashCallahan,Candy for my girlfriend........,6,22 March 2012,"So Jonah Hill is a babysitter.Thats the premise of the film, and somebody bought that idea.It's basically a very very lose homage to 'Adventures in Babysitting' or 'A Night On The Town' depending where you live.Hill is babysitting three children all with issues, and his girlfriend asks him to get him some 'powder' and in return, she will make him a man.He meets Sam Rockwell, one of the kids steals some more 'powder' and hilarity ensues.It's good that Hill is a good screen presence as he really saves the movie from being completely over the top and mediocre.His character is likable enough for you to actually care about his situation, and the children are kooky enough to provide a few laughs.The only real problem is with Rockwells villain, who like the majority of villains in comedies has a weird trait. His is making best friends and putting them in a list. It's not funny and gets annoying very quickly.All in all it's diverting, and doesn't out stay it's welcome being just shy of 80 minutes.",The Sitter

Jonah stars as Noah, a sad sack who finds his P-whipped self attempting to score coke while babysitting three ridiculous kids, A lot of adjectives came to mind when watching this awful little film.

Jonah Hill plays a suburban babysitter to three troubled youths. Slater is a troubled young boy with a secret which is obvious. Blithe acts like a young pageant contestant.

15,StevePulaski,A deflated and desperate ride through the formula of chaos,2,10 December 2011,"The Sitter is a deflated comedy robbed of all laughs, jokes, and originality. It knows formula well, but doesn't know where to go from there. It also knows how to pick a lovable lead actor who is consistently funny in everything he does. It's the second film to be released by independent filmmaker David Gordon Green this next to Your Highness. Both will earn a special place on my list of worst films for 2011.Even since Your Highness, David Gordon Green has successfully put me in a state of never-ending puzzlement. Here's a guy that has made back to back acclaimed independent features, and now, chooses to use his time directing lame, directionless comedies without wit or a soul. The Sitter takes an already mediocre premise and refuses to push it off its feet into something more original or fresh. It understands the formula inside out, but proceeds to disregard everything else.Noah (Hill) is a layabout who is lured into babysitting three children for his mom's friend so they can go to a party together. The kids are sexual confused Slater (Record), the pint sized fourth Kardashian Blithe (Bender), and the rebellious Latino Rodrigo (Hernandez). What kind of children are these? They're not normal children. They feel like real people shrunk down to fit pint sized kids. Regardless, their roles aren't at all funny.Soon after arriving at the job and discovering the chaotic duty behind it, Noah's girlfriend Marisa (Graynor) calls asking him to deliver her cocaine at a party and she'll reward him with sex. Noah tries to get cocaine, but Rodrigo winds up stealing an egg full of cocaine, costing Noah over $10,000.Oh, and I'm not even going to continue from there. The film is relentless in its gags and events, none of them even remotely realistic or the least bit funny. The biggest laughs, in fact, aren't even from Jonah Hill, but J.B. Smoove who you may recognize as Leon from Curb Your Enthusiasm. I actually would've adored the idea of him playing the babysitter much more than Hill. Don't you hate it when that happens? In the same movie, you find an actor who is playing the secondary character, but you wind up liking him more than the actor playing primary character and wish the film went through some sort of star reversal? The endangerment of the kids is sickening, the jokes appallingly unfunny, the setups are outlandish, and the sentimentality the film tries to shoot for at the end is deplorable. We just saw a man put these children through hell, he's unapologetic throughout the entire film, and now he wants to make a complete three-sixty and get on their good side.Is this as bad as Green's Your Highness? It's close. Your Highness at least had the ability to have me stay frustrated for several hours after watching the film. I got over The Sitter's abashed nature quickly, but felt saddened and cheated. I was hoping that Green would seek redemption in the character and everything wouldn't go the way it was supposed to. Green isn't the director who stays inside the lines, so I was hoping he'd make a smarter comedy here.The Sitter is an exercise is cheap filmmaking. It relies on lackluster stereotypes, recycled jokes, and caricatures to function inside its dead formula. It's a miserable comedic workout.Starring: Jonah Hill, Ari Graynor, Sam Rockwell, Method Man, Kevin Hernandez, Max Records, and Landry Bender. Directed by: David Gordon Green.",The Sitter
16,DKosty123,Almost A Good Film,5,13 September 2020,"While the cast here shows some talent and late in the movie chemistry together, it doe not make up for a script that is just uneven.The film is meant to be a comedy but the jokes just are not there all the way through. Many sequences play more like a drama. While the actors rise above the material, it's just not enough to make this a better film. It is fun to watch, but it's not funny.Jonah is the sitter who get drafted to sit 3 dis-functional kids. There is a girl who wants to grow up and be famous too soon. An adopted boy who thinks nobody loves him so his hobby is blowing up and breaking things. The there is a boy who is having a major identity crisis. It does not help that Jonah has the hots for their mom.Then again Jonahs mom is just a divorcee trying to start out with a new boyfriend. Dad does not care about her or Jonah and has bumped Jonahs former babysitter and started another family. Meanwhile the kids parents are in trouble too as dad is popping Debra, his office assistant, and mom has some quirks of her own.All together there are some comic opportunities here but the script just does not quite bring them off. Also, Jonah has a College girlfriend he bumps into and their romance does not start to take any shape until the movie is over. This is a missed opportunity.The problems with the script are really unrealistic situations and it seems like every person who meets Jonah already knows him from someplace. This just seems strange because nobody can possibly by chance one wild night meet a bunch of people who all know him. With that in mind, if you put your mind into the mode of a moron and accept all the situations thrown into the script, you can enjoy some fun. It's just not funny.",The Sitter
17,KineticSeoul,"Rude and crude version of ""Despicable Me""",5,18 March 2013,"This is a rude and crude comedy that probably won't be a classic but it's a watchable one. None of the scenarios in this movie is believable and is over the top. The plot is basically about this guy named Noah(Jonah Hill) who is a bit of a dick and a conceited one that gets forced into babysitting so his mom could go on a date. I wasn't sure which Jonah Hill I was going to get and this time around it's the slightly awkward but practical dick of a character Jonah who is somewhat likable when the movie is finished. When I say practical, he is practical compared to a lot of the other characters in this movie. Anyways he decides to go on this mission while babysitting to get this girl named Marisa played by Ari Graynor who reminds me of Renée Zellweger some drugs. So she would let him screw her. And the the 3 kids he has to drag along with him causes a bit of trouble for Noah. Especially the kid Rodrigo played by Kevin Hernandez. Who will probably end up playing Mexican mob boss roles in the future. Anyways along the way he gets himself into weird and messed up situations. I didn't find it all that funny but it was somewhat amusing I guess. Oh and Kylie Bunbury is in this and this was the first time I saw her in a movie and she is hot and cute. Even if her role is far from being believable.5.9/10",The Sitter
18,Hellmant,Good but will never be as fondly remembered as the Elizabeth Shue classic.,7,8 February 2012,"'THE SITTER': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) Modern update of the 80's teen classic 'ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING'. This one is actually R rated and a little cruder and more vulgar with David Gordon Green (director of 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' and 'YOUR HIGHNESS') directing. We don't get a hot young female star in this one (like the original's youth fantasy girl Elizabeth Shue) but we do get Jonah Hill in a leading man role and he's just as capable and funny as ever. It was written by first time writers Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and the overall result is pretty impressive, all things considering, but will never be as fondly remembered as the Elizabeth Shue classic. Hill plays Noah Griffith, a suspended college student who lives with his mom (Jessica Hecht). As a favor to his single mother he agrees to take a babysitting job from his mother's friend Mrs. Pedulla (Erin Daniels). He of course finds himself in over his head with Pedulla's three troublesome kids and things get further complicated when Noah gets a call from his would-be girlfriend (Ari Graynor) wanting him to bring her drugs at a party. Hoping to get laid as a result Noah agrees to do her bidding, once again, and takes the kids with him to get drugs, which of course turns into more trouble from there on out. The movie is very funny at times and surprisingly crude for a teen comedy. Green's directing is once again impressive and Hill and the other cast members are all more than adequate but the movie is also filled with cheesy uplifting drama (like every teen classic should be). The movie works for the most part and is a great throwback to the 80's classics it emulates. As far as babysitting adventures go we could have done a lot worse.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8oXDJoapdc",The Sitter
19,thesar-2,Sitting On the Sidelines,1,21 January 2013,"When the mean-spirited, horrible characters, including the ""innocents,"" in The Sitter turned all lovey-dovey and ""lesson learned!"" it was too-little, too-late, I'm afraid.Take one of the best gay-acceptance scenes/speeches I've seen in a movie and it almost grabbed me. Almost made me start warming up to the movie. Almost.You see, you just have to remember the first half of disgusting chaos. ""The Sitter,"" Noah (Johan Hill,) puts three kids into extreme harm's way to the point of locking him away from society until he's 99 and it's all for the most obviously bad ""girlfriend"" in film history.Sadly, it's not funny, it's not adventurous and it's not original. The loser Noah is coaxed into babysitting a menace bomb-dropper, a pill-popping Macaulay Culkin clone and a sex-crazed little girl. None of them have personality, none you want to root for and none are a bit realistic to think these three would ever share the same roof. Further, after you already begin to despise the sitter, you will not want these punks to succeed either.I mentioned he did this for a bad girl. Well, it goes beyond that in a rush. He has to go buy cocaine and, of course, takes the kids with him into the ""gay underground"" of drug dealers. He ""has to"" buy the cocaine to impress his witch and maaaaybe, she'll have sex with him. If the kids live through the experience(s), that's totally incidental to him.As for the gay acceptance – thanks, Jonah, for portraying that pretty well, but what happened with all the other scenes of extreme stereotypes and sad gay characters, including one of the most annoying queens on wheels since the birth of cinema?When the movie kicks into ""moral"" territory, i.e. when the sitter realizes he needs to lighten up – I think that's the message? – he continues into obscurity and outrageously irresponsible behavior, such as ""justifiably"" stealing a car, and never once are consequences brought up.Movies and their characters are just getting meaner and meaner. Darker and darker. It shouldn't be a coincidence this was released to video mere weeks after the other decadent Project X, where morals are tossed, consequences be damned and kids are feeling more frisky by taking irresponsibility to the Devil's level.People might comment that I'm taking these movies too literally. Well, I do believe there should be a level of accountability that's hardly shown. Beyond the whole Natural Born Killers film, there's a certain small scene I will never forget in 2001's Bully. The bad, BAD, kids at the end are being questioned in court and they're bickering back and forth like a Seinfeld finale as if nothing they did was wrong, or their fault and onlookers starred at them in tremendously sad disbelief. If this were to appear in one of these mean movies, especially Project X, it would've changed my whole perspective. Both that movie and this one end with our ""changed HERO(es)"" and how they all-but ride off into the sunset without the slightest bit of remorse or any punishable consequence. I look at films like these with the same sad disbelief.Poor Johan Hill. He was just nominated this year for an Oscar. Perhaps this is his Norbit.",The Sitter
20,g-bodyl,Could Have Been Funnier!,6,30 May 2013,"I think The Sitter has a good premise and all but I really didn't laugh much. I had a few forced laughs and maybe one real laugh. Also, this movie seemed to take itself too seriously. This is supposed to be a comedy, but there are some serious scenes that do not belong. Also, this movie goes by the formula. It would be nice if we see something different, but unfortunately we don't. All this being said, there are still good moments such as Jonah Hill, the short running-time, and an amusing Sam Rockwell.David Gordon Green's film is about one lazy guy named Noah who has been forced to babysit three kids. It turns out his night of babysitting will turn out to be a greater adventure than he thought of.The acting is okay. Jonah Hill is one of the better young actors these days and he does a good job with the material he was given. The three kids were decent and not as annoying as other child actors these days. I really liked the amusing turn by Sam Rockwell. He definitely had the best scenes in the movie as the guy who's after Noah.Overall, this is an amusing, but easily forgettable and not-really-funny movie. I wish that this film would have been like Pineapple Express. That would have made this movie funnier. I guess this movie is an end-of-the-year comedy that's out there for people tired of action or award movies. It wasn't great but it's not terrible. I rate this film 6/10.",The Sitter

I have to admit that I really like Jonah Hill and think everything he does is funny. I was very weary of this one though since the preview wasn't that exciting.

What he doesn't realize is that he is getting much more than he bargained for than just a few measly bucksWith these types of comedies, it's not hard to tell what you're getting. They go out of their way to cross the line to make people laugh, and usually I find that lazy, but I can't help but admit that I managed to have a decent time with this one. Most of the kids are whiny and unlikable, it goes for the kitchen sink in terms of being rancid, but I couldn't help but laugh at it. Maybe it was just the mood I was in, but I had some fun. Jonah Hill is his usual dependable self. His lazy character is detestable and I absolutely loved it. Kevin Hernandez is by far the best of the bunch of the kids as Rodrigo. He steals the show as the malevolent kid. I got a kick out of him. And, of course, we get the ever reliable Sam Rockwell.

23,Rodrigo_Amaro,A silly embarrassment,3,9 May 2013,"In ""The Sitter"", a male babysitter (Jonah Hill) has plenty of trouble in taking care of three problematic kids and their internal affairs, and also trying to arrange drugs for his ""girlfriend"". Gee, how original. It lacks me of words to describe how pointless and dull this movie was. All I can say is that it wasn't funny. Really not funny. Maybe two or three moments and even in those it was just a matter of haha, very brief. Meh. A very big meh to this.Coming up with scenarios and situations are quite difficult, specially in Hollywood these days, it looks like everything that needed to exist in terms of situations were already created, invented and used in any movie out there. This film already existed, it's ""Adventures in Babysitting"" and the people who saw it claims it is way better than this thing. I have vague remembrances of that movie, good remembrances, and if I watch that today it'll be a hundred times better than ""The Sitter"". Why it fails? More than just being unfunny, is that it wants to be more than what it is: R rated comedy that only gets laughs due to its language rather for its comical elements and amusing moments. It tries to be holy grail of bad examples and exemplary at the same time! The first in its use of language, drugs, violence and sex jokes while dealing with kids (but they know so much more these days that it's pointless to discuss moral) and the second while trying to pass the image of being a helpful movie with the purpose to educate problematic kids. Hill takes care of those: a girl concerned with the amount of makeup in her face, and who wants to be a celebrity and stuff; a Latino kid with Unabomber tendencies, angry for his condition of being adopted believing he'll have to go with another family; and the less problematic of the family who thinks he suffers from anxiety issues when in fact those, if real, exist because he's gay and is in love with his best friend. To each, Hill presents words of advices and comfort, helping all of them while taking care of them and getting involved in discussions with drug dealers, his girlfriend and school acquaintances. Such contradictions between troubled character helping others with their issues exist in plenty of movies and sometimes they work; in here it's just unfunny, prejudicial - specially the ethnic stereotype - and reduced to simplistic formulas. The only thing I praise in here is the way it dealt with the gay kid, played by the efficient Max Records, clearly the greatest actor in the movie along with Sam Rockwell, but Sam was heavily underused in this. It doesn't fall into stereotypical behavior, it just present his problems in a believable way, trying to understand his feelings and things around him. High point of this involves a dramatic scene after being rejected by his best friend, where the baby-sitter and the kids are on the subway, and he's noticing a gay couple in front of him, they're so in tune with each other and he's looking at them, all sad and almost in tears, knowing that's all he wants to be involved with. Hill notices this and later on he comforts the kid. The movie got completely right in this point, without making fun of a vulnerable character, for never being prejudicial or using of shameful jokes to make fun of him throughout its time. ""The Sitter"" never compensates with laughs but it addresses a terrific message with those moments which are the few good things to be remembered afterwards. In fact, David Gordon Green should've written a dramatic film focused on that kid and make something completely different instead of making this wreck. Green's dramas are better than his comedies and that's a fact. Sorry to break some hopes but not even Jonah Hill makes this worth seeing. Not only he presents a small variation from the same tune, full mouthed character who throws a ""WTF?"" at each scene and has some problems in the sex department, but he proves that he needs good sidekick on his side. With Michael Cera in ""Superbad"" he was hilarious; in ""21 Jump Street"" with Channing Tatum, a very good team. Let alone with a bunch of kids simply doesn't work. ""The Sitter"" was a failed ""Get Him to the Greek"": it's all about Hill escorting troubled characters while solving his own problems. The comedy got lost in the way. 3/10",The Sitter

As with many R-rated studio comedies, the transgressive humor isn't nearly as offensive as the phony sentiment that's supposed to redeem it, supplied here in stale scenes of the sitter bonding with his little charges. You could probably write a dissertation on the movie's racial anxiety: from a safe and tidy world, the sitter ventures into an urban nightmare. This repellent dualism is complicated only by the careful addition of a vicious white coke dealer (Sam Rockwell) and the female other love itnerst in the end (Kylie Bunbury) with an inexplicable crush on the obese hero. In general the film falls flat with the comedy and there isn't too much high points.",The Sitter
25,Ed-Shullivan,A rating of 1 out of 10 and even this is too generous,1,19 January 2014,"A rating of 1 out of 10 and even this is too generousHow so called ""Comedy"" movies like this ever make it through and get a ""green light"" for production will forever astound me. Some producers must have huge egos and even bigger bank rolls. I can only surmise that a deal was struck between the producer and Jonah Hill, (or with the director) that they had a total free hand to put on the silver screen whatever their warped minds thought would be funny, or that would shock their audience.Well surprise to the audience and the producer. This was a total failure on all fronts. If I was Jonah Hill I would not expect to be receiving many phone calls from any prominent producers or directors in the near future. But again to my amazement we see that Jonah Hill is up for an Academy Award for a Best Supporting Actor award for the feature film The Wolf of Wall Street. Go figure?But take my advice The Sitter is a total waste of time and minus any sense of drawing laughter or any memorable moments. The shock and awe opens up the film with a disgusting scene and the film continues to stink from the opening scene to the end of the film. I am sure no one was more disappointed than the script writer who must have envisioned a different film from the onset than the finished product the director and/or editor created.If I attempt to compare The Sitter to a film such as Robin Williams' 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, the pretense of a Babysitter themed film assisting young and confused children find their way through troubled times may be a comparison one could make, but the end product of these two films are like comparing night to day. There were so many good scenes in Mrs Doubtfire and so many bad scenes in the Sitter.

27,Kingslaay,Enjoyed this more than I thought I would,7,27 June 2021,I didn't expect much from this film. The plot looked thin and predictable. But it was passable in most respects. A lot of it is to do with Jonah Hill who is quite talented and genuinely funny in these sort of roles. He makes it look easy and quite believable. The adventures he and the 3 kids go on is quite amusing and funny. There are also a few deeper moments where the film actually goes further and targets issues the kids are facing. I don't think this film would have landed better with a different actor. Jonah helps carry this simple and limited film.,The Sitter
28,brando647,One of the Worst Movies of 2011,4,30 May 2012,"After having watched this movie, I can't help but ask myself, ""Why did I even bother giving it a chance?"" The trailers never really grabbed my interest and the countless negative reviews should have been enough to steer me clear, but I maintained faith that Jonah Hill would deliver. I mean, even if the majority of the movie sucked, surely Hill would provide enough laughs to keep me mildly entertained through the measly 81 running time. I was wrong. Very wrong. I don't know who this movie was meant to entertain, but obviously I'm not part of that demographic. I should be fair: THE SITTER wasn't nearly as miserable as TRANFORMERS 2. So, that's a plus. This movie is just lazy. The plot is lazy, the characters are lazy, and it all makes for an incredibly boring movie. The film centers on disgraced college dropout Noah Griffith (Hill) who is coaxed into babysitting for a friend of the family. He's introduced to the three walking nightmares he'll be spending the evening with: anxiety-wracked Slater, celebrity-obsessed Blithe, and pyromaniacal adopted child Rodrigo. As he's settling with for the night, he gets a call from his drug-addicted ""girlfriend"" promising him sex if he shows up to a party that night with cocaine. So Noah does as any rational person would do and packs the kids into a minivan to find some cocaine for a woman who, after a quick introduction in the opening of the film, everyone knows is only using him.Every character in this movie is an idiot (with the only exception being Roxanne, played by Kylie Bunbury). Noah's an idiot, the parents are idiots, and the kids are idiots. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but expecting an audience to accept that all of these people make the absolute dumbest choices in this film is just plain wrong. But that's fine. There are idiot characters in movies all the time, and this is a comedy after all. The problem is that this movie isn't funny. The only person in this movie who managed to elicit any sort of chuckle of out me was Sam Rockwell as one of the most bizarre drug dealers I've ever seen in a movie. He's a touchy-feely sort of guy who places massive importance on his friendships, even with Noah (who becomes his eighth best friend in the world after their short initial meeting). Still, you never get on a dealer's bad side and Noah does just that. So the majority of the movie is Noah with the three kids trying to pull together the $10,000 needed to pay him off. It all goes wrong of course, but I didn't care because I was too busy checking my watch to see how much more of this garbage I had to sit through. I'm all cool with a movie using vulgarity to try and boost the impact of its gags (I really enjoyed SUPERBAD), but this movie is just vulgar for the sake of being vulgar. A little girl craps her pants in the confines of a minivan. That's the joke. Get it?And what's worse is the movie's determination to cram in ""meaningful moments"". Everyone in the movie has issues. Noah refuses to accept that his girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor, who becomes nerve-grating within minutesseriously, I was hoping her role in the movie would end with her getting hit by a car while screeching in the middle of the road how she hates kids) is a user with no real interest in him. Each of the kids has an issue that the movie feels the need to address with a tender moment. Seriously, just stop forcing it. None of the scenes felt natural in the movie and I was just wishing they'd move on. All it did was slow down a movie that was already suffering from severe pacing problems. The cast of this film must've known this movie was doomed because no one really tries. Even Hill, who I usually enjoy, was just phoning it in. I guess he must've owed someone a favor and he knew this movie would eventually just be swept under the carpet when MONEYBALL was released. Sam Rockwell is really the only redeeming quality in the movie because he's the only character that elicits any laughs. He's the saving grace that prevented me from giving this a rating any lower. I can't really recommend this movie to anyone because I have a hard time believing anyone would find it worthwhile.",The Sitter

He gets praised for his role in Moneyball and had a few good lines and now he's a comedian? Not in my book. And, I took this out because of his work in Moneyball. Go figure.

It moves along endearingly as we tag along on her quest and watch the chemistry blossom between her and her neighbor. It's daily by the numbers but possesses a zesty charm.

When Noah's mother enlists his help babysitting for a friend's kids so she can keep her date, Noah reluctantly finds himself caring for a trio of problematic children including anxiety ridden Slater (Max Records), adopted pyromaniac and borderline psychopathic Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez), and vain, attention hungry Blithe (Landry Bender) who wishes to be an aspiring club girl. When Noah has a chance to finally have actual sex with his girlfriend he takes the kids with him into the city to score some drugs at her request, but the kids bring all kinds of chaos including spurring the vengeance of insane drug dealer Karl (Sam Rockwell)Produced in 2011, The Sitter was one of two films by Pineapple Express director David Gordon Green to be released along with Your Highness. The film was a commercial and critical disappointment but its effects on its cast and crew were negligible as Hill also starred in Oscar winning Moneyball and the next year would lead the successful and well regarded 21 Jump Street, and David Gordon Green would return to indie fare before going mainstream resurrecting the Halloween franchise. While it's nice the fallout was minimal, The Sitter is unfortunately a rather by the numbers affair that was standard of films trying to ape the success of the Hangover where crude, gross, and mean is somehow automatically funny.The movie makes a misguided introduction from the outset establishing Noah as a loser with a sex buddy who doesn't respect him while also making Noah a lazy irresponsible idiot with no aspirations that reach beyond sitting in an armchair in his mother's house. When Noah is saddled with the three kids who are all varying degrees of ""quirky"" with Max Records' Slater probably being the best performance by default, the movie becomes rather aggravating especially with Blithe's Paris Hilton/Tara Reid persona (I think, it's actually kind of hard to tell what they're going for here) used to rather cringing effect. The movies first half is basically a barrage of scatological, urinary, and gay panic jokes which are set up poorly no sense of comic friction or much in the way of payoff. But then the movie tries to play itself for pathos with its kid characters all having revelations that ring rather hollow especially when it comes to a ""coming out"" moment that rings rather hollow against the movie's crass humor. The performances are at least decent, with Sam Rockwell clearly having fun playing the unhinged Karl who steals the scene whenever he's on camera.The Sitter has the same recurring problems of post 2009 comedies in that it goes for shock thinking that will be enough to sustain comic momentum. With unlikable characters and a rather sleazy approach that does a tonal 180 trying to play itself for character growth, The Sitter just doesn't work.",The Sitter

It starred a very young and beautiful Elizabeth Shue as she babysat three children, a nerdy teenager and his Thor-obsessed little sister, with their ginger Playboy reading best friend. She had to leave the house to help her stuck-in-the-middle-of-nowhere mate with the kids in tow. Along the way, they got into some scrapes involving car thieves, nightclub patrons and gang-bangers, while learning that despite their differences and age disparities, through working together, they could achieve anything. Of course it was a lot of fun too, with scenes and stretches of dialogue that will live long in the memory. A true 80's classic.In the present day, there is a terrible movie called The Sitter. It stars a very overweight and irritating Jonah Hill as he babysits three children: a gay teenager and his celebrity-obsessed little sister, with their borderline psychotic adopted brother. He has to leave the house to help his needs-drugs-to-get-high-at-a-party girlfriend with the kids in tow. Along the way, they get into some scrapes involving homosexual gangsters, black stereotypes and street-fighters, while learning that despite stealing money, drugs and blowing up toilets, through working together, they could achieve anything.

37,Christian_Dimartino,One of the worst films of 2011.,4,1 April 2012,"Whenever I hear that Jonah Hill is in a movie, I immediately delete half a star from the rating. With the exception of Knocked Up, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Funny People, there hasn't been a perfect Jonah Hill film. And if you notice, the three films i've mentioned don't have him as the main character. In his latest work, The sitter, he is the main character. Problem #1.Hill plays Noah, a college guy who needs a job. To make his mom happy, Noah decides to babysit for his moms friends kids. And these kids are unbelievable. After a short amount of time, Noah goes to have sex with his girlfriend(or hopes to) and ends up involved with a drug dealer(played by Sam Rockwell) who is possibly gay.The film is at its strongest when Sam Rockwell is involved. But other than that, The Sitter is a disaster. It's overly cliché, it has the story plot of a kids movie, but the mouth of Jonah Hill, and the film really showed me why I grew to hate him in the first place. When he first blew up from Superbad, he was so gross and obnoxious and it made me wonder why he was famous. That, and he's just not funny. Hill makes a lot of cheesy reference jokes, such as one with the girl being Jon Boney Ramsey(yes, they went there) that just fall flat.I also hate the way they have kids acting here. It's good to see Max Records, the very talented young actor from Where the Wild Things Are, back on screen. But that return should not have been this. His talent is wasted, but luckily he's the only somewhat normal and likable one. Even though his character really is the worst. The other two kids are really obnoxious and gross. They should not have a little girl sharting, or a Mexican kid crapping out bombs and being the one that ruins everything for everyone. It's crude, it's rude, it's unnecessary, and they take one of the kids character way too far. Almost awkwardly so. Actually, fully awkwardly so.Overall, The Sitter doesn't work. But it's not as bad as Your Highness, the years worst film. This is one of them, but not the worst. Incidentally, both films are from director David Gordon Green, who's other films include Pineapple Express and Snow Angels.

Close to never, honestly, and so with that reasoning why not go balls-out? Jonah Hill is a very likable character in the film with an understandable ploy. It lacks the in-your-face violence of director previous film ""Pineapple Express"", but it is definitely hilarious, no doubt about that. The kids are very well played, and thankfully come out as pretty decent characters. Thankfully nowhere near as annoying as the duo of the ""Are We There Yet?"" films.

One of them is a little girl with a make-up obsession and a horrid R-rated mouth, the other is an adopted Latino boy that breaks everything and blows up toilets, and a 13-year-old boy who tries to hide his sexual identity and is obsessed with anxiety pills.

It took forever to get to the point, and you already predict how these characters are going through these situations. Also, the characters in this movie are the most annoying and unlikeable characters of any other movie. Jonah Hill was so funny in ""Get Him to the Greek"", and he was excellent in ""Moneyball"". So, why did he agree to make this movie? He was such a retard, and you don't seem to care about this guy. The girlfriend was super annoying, the black misfits were awkward, but the three kids were super creepy. The Latino boy is such a horrid person, that I hated him from start to finish. The make-up obsessed girl is so weird and creepy, that it was so super uncomfortable. The kid with anxiety problems was so super annoying from scene to scene. Also, Sam Rockwell has no idea what he's doing in a movie like this. I mean to say this because he plays a drug dealer who Noah needs to owe money to. The movie goes from situation to situation, that it's all super predictable, and they don't matter. Like I said, there are some funny moments that made me laugh, but then it just stopped, and they started to deliver a few chuckles and groans, and then, for the rest of the entire hour, no laugh came out of my mouth. Director David Gordon Greene must have had a messed-up mind, to agree and make a movie like this. Seriously, the movie was so complicated and obnoxious, I hardly remember the whole thing. Yes, I forgot almost everything about it. So, a messed-up plot that dragged, messed up characters, some fun laughs, and you get three annoying kids: one who was annoying, one who was creepy, and one who was a horrible person. Also, the way that young actors were portrayed was totally offensive. But this isn't the type of movie that made me want to rip the movie apart, and forget that I would never see that movie, or try replacing the movie from the whole world. Instead, I just said to myself, ""No!"". The movie maybe is fun, but you'll seem to forget everything about it later. Not good and not terrible, all mixed up in one. ""The Sitter"" is not that terrible, but not that funny either. ""The Sitter"", in my review, ""sometimes laughable, but dull and pointless"".",The Sitter
41,PoisonKeyblade,A near-perfect end of the year Comedy,9,11 December 2011,"Hilarious from start to finish, The Sitter injected a much-needed R-rated comedy boost to the draggy awards season of December. Jonah Hill delivers another funny performance, but the real surprise for me was the shocking pro-gay message featuring one of the first kid-related gay story lines in a mainstream film. Max Records, the awesomely talented kid from Where the Wild Things Are, has no problem with the content and easily delivers a calculated performance. I guess I was so surprised because gay content is rarely dealt with so carefully in a Hollywood film marketed toward young adults, and I have to say I was really impressed. The kids make the movie all the better, and each of them is given a relatively well-developed backstory. The movie never sputters out, running at a perfect pace and hitting all the right punches. Even Sam Rockwell is awesome as a crazy could-be-gay drug dealer who chases the sitter and the children all across town. The Sitter is a movie I'd easily recommend and another fun treat from director David Gordon Green.",The Sitter
42,Chris_Pandolfi,It's Gonna Be One Hell of a Night,6,9 December 2011,"Yet again, I find myself in the position of not knowing how to feel. ""The Sitter"" is a strange movie – a raunchy comedy, buddy movie, and action picture all rolled into one. That it involves children in the same space as drug dealers, thugs, prostitutes, jewel heists, gunshots, fistfights, cocaine, and explosives is nothing short of reprehensible. That it works regardless is nothing short of miraculous. For director David Gordon Green, it represents either enormous confidence or extreme stupidity. When it isn't resorting to desperately broad levels of low-grade humor, it makes candid statements about responsibility and self-esteem that are overly sentimental, as if they were transplanted from an afterschool special. Because of this, there's never a moment when something doesn't feel grossly out of place.What I can say with absolute certainty is that it didn't stir within me the same hatred I felt for Green's previous feature, the hopelessly strained and profoundly unfunny ""Your Highness."" That being said, at least I was sure how I felt about that film. In this case, I'm torn between admiring Green's audacity and condemning him for allowing something so atmospherically inconsistent into theaters. This movie truly does not know what it wants to be. I found myself laughing on several occasions, although never once at what was happening in the story; I was, for some inexplicable reason, amused by the filmmaker's attempts to make it into something more than it actually is. ""The Sitter"" might be worth seeing only on the basis that you may never see anything like it again.Taking place somewhere in New York, the plot involves a suspended college student named Noah (a pre-weight loss Jonah Hill), who lives with his mom. They have a brief discussion over his lack of employment, after which he's roped into a babysitting job.Here enters the Pedulla family. The first shot of the mom (Erin Daniels) immediately pans down to her chest and gives us an ample view of her cleavage. We then meet her children. Slater (Max Records) is a sullen thirteen-year-old who treats his anxiety disorders with medication he keeps in a fanny pack. He constantly texts a boy from school in a desperate attempt to find out why he isn't hanging around anymore. His little sister, Blithe (Landry Bender), dreams of being a celebutante and spends every waking moment playing the part. She dresses in hip clothing, wears gaudy makeup, listens to hip hop, and fantasizes about going to trendy clubs. Their adopted brother, Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez), is from El Salvador. He talks like a murderous warlord and has a habit of running away. He wears a leather jacket and boots, enjoys destroying fragile items, and has a fine collection of cherry bombs. Needless to say, one or two toilets will explode before the night is over.Initially, Noah and the kids don't get along, Blithe least of all. It doesn't help that, during their first encounter, she sprays perfume into his mouth. Not long after the parents leave for the night, Noah gets a call from his self-centered girlfriend, Marisa (Ari Graynor). She'll have sex with him, but only if he brings a stash of cocaine to a party she's attending in the city. He, of course, says yes, although this means having to take the kids with him. His first stop is the den of a drug dealer named Karl (Sam Rockwell), who, despite being a psychopath, insists on giving out hugs and likes to rank his friendships. I have never been to a drug den, although I suspect none of them are frequented by shirtless gay bodybuilders doing construction work. The sentry, a flamboyant Hispanic, glides around on roller skates. He will eventually be shot in the leg, but so it goes.And things just sort of snowball from here. Rodrigo steals an egg full of cocaine. Yes, an egg. Karl must be compensated $10,000 by midnight, or else. Noah goes to his awful deadbeat dad for help, knowing not long after that he won't be receiving it. A car will be stolen. He will break into a jewelry store. He will get into a scuffle with a black woman who was at one time his high school classmate; I leave it to you to find out why she's mad at him. He will get into a fight with Marisa's ex-boyfriend. When the action pauses, he will have shockingly thoughtful conversations with the kids, who eventually realize how badly they've been behaving and decide to help Noah survive the night. He will also meet another former high school classmate, a young woman who shares his passion for astronomy and awaits the arrival of a magnetic storm. And, of course, the kids have to somehow get home before the parents do.Is this movie for real? I can understand why critics haven't responded to it; the tone is inconsistent, the plot meanders, the characters are barely-developed caricatures that are nothing close to authentic (especially the kids), and the performances are hilariously unconvincing. I share in these criticisms. But somehow, I'm prevented from dismissing this movie altogether. There's something so irresistibly alien about it. You may not find it funny. You may not even understand it. But it's unlikely you'll be able to tear your eyes away during any of its eighty-one minutes. There are some people who have insolated themselves in their own oddness so that they can't be harmed no matter what anyone else does. ""The Sitter"" works in very much the same way. Take that for whatever its worth.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",The Sitter
43,ghost_dog86,Winner of the worst script of the year.,2,14 December 2011,"""The Sitter"" is ""Adventures in Babysitting"" with F-bombs, forced drug humor and middle school sex jokes. Directed by David Gordon Green (Pineapple Express, Your Highness), a man who is astonishingly coming out with his second most unfunny comedy this year, and starring Jonah Hill who is unfortunately in Green's second most unfunny comedy of the year . The writers of this fiasco of a script are newcomers Brain Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, who seemed only to have pieced together scripts from multiple 1980's B-movie style teen flicks and added in some dialogue, which consists of crude jokes from their failed stand-up careers. The end result is that ""The Sitter"" may contain one or two funny jokes, but they are buried within a dung-heap of a script.Side Note: This movie contains an all too unfortunate supporting performance from the great Sam Rockwell (Moon) that I do not wish to write about, for fear of becoming too angry to continue with my review.""The Sitter"" was more than likely an attempt by Hollywood to see how well Jonah Hill (Superbad) did as a leading comedic actor, and not just the fat sidekick character. And while his performance is what it is, the real flaw here is not with Hill's performance, but with the storyline (or lack of). Let me paint a picture. There is no storyline!!! In maybe the most idiotic plot since ""Cowboys & Aliens"", Hill plays random loser/nice-guy, with zero potential as a human being, Noah Griffith. Noah has a girlfriend that treats him like garbage. His mom asks him to take a job as a babysitter, babysitting a motley crew of the most one dimensional children put on the big screen since 2010's ""Grown-Ups. He takes it for seemingly no reason. Noah makes some inexplicably horrid choices, again for seemingly no reason, which result in some of the cheapest slap-spick comedic scenarios of the year and at the end of the night he learns a lesson, but not really. That's it. No action in the movie has any justification behind it. This movie simply powers forward through a rolodex of shrug inducing jokes, totally disregarding the fact that the audience probably isn't laughing. The storyline has absolutely no direction. As Noah takes the children on a drug run (because the script deems it so) the audience is bombarded with cocaine in the face jokes, followed by an ill-conceived sentimental moment, followed by a man's groin being set on fire, and then back to the grossly overplayed sentimentality. It just doesn't flow at all. This script is so bad, that there was even a point in the middle of this movie where Noah has an epiphany that acknowledges (out loud) his girlfriends true feeling towards him, which should have altogether halted his quest to see his girlfriend (or the entire point of the film) and ended the movie. BUT NO! The plot moves forward despite this game changing revelation; and why? Conceivably, because Green, as a director, didn't catch or wish to acknowledge this egregious plot-hole in the script. So, the audience must sit through the final forty-five minutes of ""The Sitter"", as if that scene never happened.With a script as half-assed as this seemed to be, one would assume that the characters throughout are bound to be just as problematic. And that brings me to the children. The children here are so underdeveloped that they aren't even people, they are simply emotions used to move the razor-thin plot along. A bratty little girl who uses foul language (yeah, that would have been funnier if I were seven), a super emotional pre-teen boy whose storyline attempts to become sentimental, but verges on borderline homophobic, and a stereotypical Latin kid who thinks he's Scarface, does not a film make! And as for those sentimental moments, they are truly the most cringe inducing aspect here. I'm sorry, but any movie that would have Jonah Hill giving out sappy life lessons is doomed for failure. But again, Hill wasn't the worst part of the film. The fact is, without Hill's likability as a lead actor, ""The Sitter"" would have been unwatchable.Final Thought: In the last few years Green seems to have developed a compulsion to only make terribly unfunny and bland comedies, which center around pot-heads. But the biggest punch-line of these films are how Green holds actual directors credits, yet there seems to be no direction to any of his movies. It is simply a shame that Hill chose this film to show that he could carry a lead role in a comedic film. And while he does carry this movie, with the help of Green and two hack writers, there isn't much of a movie to carry. In the end, ""The Sitter"" is the film equivalent of buyer's remorse, whereas it looked incredibly funny from the trailer, but is just the opposite once you find yourself sitting in a rather silent and rather packed theater for an unusually lengthy 81 minutes, wishing you could ask for a refund.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

44,Scott_Mercer,More Entertaining Than Expected,7,24 February 2013,"What can I say. I had heard this movie got just CREAMED by the critics when it appeared, and as far as I can remember did not do much at the box office either.But, not expecting too much, I turned it on the TeeVee last night, and found it amusing. Hill's laconic charms are well used. Sure, the unfolding situations bear virtually no relationship to the world that you and I live in. But that's part of the fun. San Rockwell plays an unhinged character like he plays much of the time. But he does that so well. I guess the key here was that I was not hoping for anything worthwhile, and the film pleasantly surprised me. Sure, this is not high drama here, but as an outrageous, silly action comedy, they hit most of the targets.Maybe I was biased. I am a big fan of the ""everything that took place on that one crazy night"" genre of comedy films, from Into The Night on down.A lot of movie-making is just magic.

47,bayardhiler,One of The Most Painful Movie Experiences Ever!,1,25 November 2012,"One night, me and my sister were looking at the on demand menu to see if there was anything good to watch and we came upon across ""The Sitter"". It was a movie that both of us had wanted to see and so, with out a second thought, we hit play. Believe me when I tell you that one of the biggest regrets of my life will forever be not picking something else because this movie was HORRIBLE!!!! The film tries to emulate movies like ""Adventures in Babysitting"" but fails miserably because of its horrible jokes and lack of any class. Jonah Hill plays the hapless loser who gets sucked into babysitting three kids from a wealthy family, including a kid they adopted from El Salvador who likes to play with bombs and lives in the basement. Really? As for the other two, we wish for them to die right away. All of this might be forgiven if the movie wasn't so devoid of any comedy. Think its funny because someone steals money from a child's bar mitzvahs? Jonah Hill seems to think so (ironic, considering that the man is Jewish). Or about a kid who purposely pees in public? And then there's the annoying woman who is using Jonah just to get her some drugs and even after realizing this, he still stands up for her when someone insults at a her party. Why? I could go on but I think you get the idea. That and the fact that I've probably spent too much time on this movie already. All I can say is avoid this movie at all costs, even if you have to watch a movie you've seen a hundred times before because trust me, it will be better than watching this dreck.",The Sitter
48,ThreeGuysOneMovie,This is not the Jonah Hill you are looking for,4,3 June 2012,"Jonah Hill is Noah Griffith (no relation to yours truly thankfully) a typical screw up who has recently been expelled from college. He lives at home with his divorced mother and has no job and no prospects for the future.On this particular night his mom is looking to go out with some friends so she can meet a blind date she has been set up with. The only problem is she can't go because her friends can't find a baby sitter. Noah reluctantly agrees to baby sit the friends children.The kids of course, are all nightmarish and start acting out as soon as the parents leave. While Noah is struggling to contain the behavior problems, his hot and cold girlfriend calls and asks Noah to come to a party that she is at. She promises Noah sex if he shows up and stops off to buy some cocaine for her. So Noah loads up the mini-van with the kids and sets out for the big city. As you can imagine, Hilarity ensues.Jonah hill has impressed as of late with some of his performances. His work on Moneyball was a standout and he stole most of scenes that he was in. Surprisingly, he actually does a good job here as well. he delivers on some pretty funny dialogue that will actually garner a few laughs.The problem with The Sitter is just that its a terrible script. The plot is ridiculous and predictable. The scenes where Noah tries to get inside the heads of the kids and teach them life lessons seem overly contrived and forced. The movie plods along to predictable conclusions that we have seen over and over again from other, much funnier, movies.I don't know how they got Sam Rockwell to appear in this film but what a waste of time and talent. His character is re-donkulous. I have no idea where they were going with his role and what they were trying to accomplish but lets use the word outlandish and leave it at that.

49,David_Brown,Bad Remake,1,17 October 2013,"Let's start with the good news, there is a good performance in ""The Sitter"" That of Roxanne ( Kylie Bunbury). Bad news: That is it. First off this movie IS a raunchy, offensive, predictable movie, complete with every character from the gay kid with identity issues, to fat the kid, to the violent Hispanic to the streetwise Black people, all of which you expect to see in a bad movie with no thought behind it. It might be the worst remake I have ever seen ( In this case, ""Adventures In a Babysitting"") and as someone who has seen that movie multiple times I would know. It goes without saying that a bit fat slob like Jonah Hill ( Noah Griffith) is not hot like Elisabeth Shue ( Chris Parker), but the kids are inferior ( particularly comparing Sara ( Maia Brewton)), to nasty Kardashian like Sister Blithe Padilla ( Landry Bender), who is essentially a Bratz Doll. Her gay brother was even more obnoxious ( these kids should be watched by Dr. Phil not a babysitter). Where else can I go? You can spot each and every scene where the film steals a shot from ""Adventures In Babysitting"" like where Roxanne returns the electronic piece to Blithe ( just like what was done with Sara's skate in ""Adventures In a Babysitting.""). By the way you can spot about 20 such scenes. Particularly bad is how the butchered the ""Babysitting Blues"" scene. Another thing they did was basically combine Brenda ( Penelope Ann Miller), with Chris's arrogant cheating b/f ( the one who Daryl ( Anthony Rapp), gave a swift kick to in the restaurant), and created Marissa ( Ari Graynor), who seemed like she is stoned throughout the entire movie. Spoiler Ahead: Jonah does end up with Roxanne in the end, like Chris does with the college student who returned the skate in ""Adventures In Babysitting"" but why I have no idea? He is pathetic and crude and she is classy and intelligent. Basically I give 1/2 star for Roxanne and that is being generous.",The Sitter
50,Caleb_Everett,Pick a lane Jonah,3,14 February 2019,"Jonah Hill tries his hardest to carry this ""Adventures in Babysitting"" remix and at moments does a great job, but this movie really fell flat for me.I would have loved to see this film not be so over the top on some of its comedic moments. It's almost as if this movie couldn't figure out who it's target audience was, there were moments of true depth and heartfelt sentiment and then moments of raunchy over the top antics. I don't necessarily understand why you would have these important life lessons that really are great for teens to hear mixed into a movie that no teen would be allowed to watch. I really wish they would have picked a lane and let the actors truly dive into their characters.The shining character in this cast was Kylie Bunbury who is the only person who comes across as genuine and believable. I was hoping that Sam Rockwell would shine, but he plays to the craziness that this movie tries to encapsulate.I'm disappointed that the great moments in this film won't be seen by teenagers because there are a few that really hit home.

He's the writer of ADVENTURES IN BABYSITTING, the 1987 comedy starring Elizabeth Shue as a reluctant, frustrated teen who takes the kids downtown to help a friend; then gets chased by bad guys and... Everything else that this movies imitates.Jonah Hill wields his usual mellow guy with stunned sarcasm but his signature dry humor's all dress up with nowhere to go. Most of the time he's putting up with each child's annoying personality: the little girl wears makeup, sings dirty lyrics, and sprays perfume in his mouth; her neurotic older (but still young) brother takes pills to feel normal; and an adopted Puerto Rican boy blows up toilets.From one dull situation to the next, it never seems the characters are in any real danger, even though a maniacal drug dealer, overacted by Sam Rockwell, wants them all dead.And the biggest (unintentional) laugh occurs when an extremely gorgeous girl admits she's had a crush on Hill since high school, and even acts nervous around him. Makes you wonder, is the overweight actor playing himself: a millionaire movie star? This is perhaps one of the worst comedies in a long time, going in one ear and out the other: like a bullet from a shotgun. And a particular scene where Hill gives one of the kids advice on life is so politically-correct, you'll long for days when comedies were meant for laughs, not agendas.For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com",The Sitter
53,nathanschubach,The spirit of John Candy would be proud,4,3 February 2012,"Wellit's a babysitting movie, so the title is apt. Jonah Hill plays Noah, a twenty-something college dropout who is trying to earn respect from his single, divorced mom and family friends by stepping up to the task of babysitting three precocious kids while trying to get in good with his lady friend. It's a movie that's been done before on a number of levels (think a modern 'Mary Poppins'-tale tied to 'Half-Baked' and 'Superbad'), but all actors need work, so I can't be that mad at it. It was funny at times (when there wasn't some physical humor or fart joke moment), but I can't help but believe that the director had someone else in mind for Noah, and Hill happened to punch up the script with edgier material. In the end, it felt like a John Candy movie like 'Uncle Buck.' The soundtrack was decent; it featured mainly 70's-90's hip hop songs, possibly as transitioning into a cameo by Method Man. Overall, it's not a multiple-watch sort of film, to me. It's cute if there's nothing else to watch, but that's about it.",The Sitter

I admit it's a kind of fun to try to expect the unexpected, but a predictable story does not equal a bad story. In fact, from the beginning of the 80 minutes or so until the end I'd been kept entertained and I honestly didn't experience many boring moments.Other than its comedic scenes, the movie does have attempts to include moving scenes that make the audience learn something. I would say those attempts are not highly effective but not at all futile efforts.The best way to conclude The Sitter is to say that it is a good comedy for young adults or above.

Kylie Bunbury is gorgeous, her character only appears close to the end of the film which is sad, I could have watched her much longer.There is a lot of adult language, humor and such, but it is rated ""R"" so this should be expected, and it actually was appropriate for the story.The film also touches on struggles of everyday life that millions of people have to deal with and I thought it showed a lot of heart in doing so.I have no idea why there are so many hater reviews here, I mean seriously what were you expecting?Summary: Go see this film and have fun.",The Sitter
58,Jerominator,Lazy Formulaic Cr#p,2,6 May 2013,"As I get older I wonder what I would have made of certain films released now back when I was 15, especially comedies. This is definitely one of those. You know - the old double take: ""Is it really *that* bad, or am I just getting old?"".I do appreciate that there's a magic line between reality-based movies, fantasy, fiction, and that there's an unwritten agreement that disbelief must be suspended on the other side of that line. Still, in this particular genre of comedy I still find myself *needing* to believe that the characters and events are at least possible. This one didn't cut the mustard though.Maybe it was just me but I thought Jonah Hill looked kind of embarrassed to be there - either that or he's just a really lazy actor. There was just something about the different aspects of his character and his reaction to certain situations that grated violently against his apparent background and circumstances - e.g. how cool, calm and collected he was in life-threatening or scary situations, how together he seemed to be versus him humiliating himself with the blonde girl; an unbelievable situation which, again, seemed entirely unnecessary.The relationship with his father again just didn't sit right.A scene where he uses jive talk(where'd he learn that then?) to magically win over a gang of menacing black thugs smacked of an embarrassing cliché left on the cutting room floor after shooting Crocodile Dundee 3.Similarly, Sam Rockwell's drug dealer and his relationship with him was off-the-scale unbelievable. How many times must I see a large container of cocaine explode in someone's face - that screenwriter doesn't even deserve his job if that's the best he can do. As for the children, while the gay boy was an interesting idea, and the girl was acceptable, the bizarre South American orphan was, again, just batsh!t crazy and unbelievable. Impossible to picture him there in that house with those people in the first place.Now like I said, it's a comedy and you need to suspend disbelief, let a few things go, but when it's all unbelievable, I lose my connection with the story and it just ceases to be funny to me. Surely thats what makes these stories funny - empathetic connection with the guy in trouble. e.g. when Steve Martin was descending into hell trying to get home for thanksgiving in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", it was all believable and I was with him on that journey every step of the way. Hilarious and emotional at the same time. Here - nothing.If in among all the random unbelievable stuff, there was good slapstick or good gags, that would go some way towards saving it, but there wasn't for my money. Lashings of ham-fisted awkward and dangerous does not necessarily make funny.And at the end of this incongruous journey, the majority of which we see the babysitter fiercely at odds with the children and not giving a damn about them, we're supposed to believe that they all warm to him suddenly for no apparent reason and sit and lap up his Springeresque thought-of-the-day advice, which of course fundamentally changes their lives. Oh please! Make it stop!I remember South Park once took a (massively hypocritical) broadside at Family Guy, implying that all of its content was randomly-generated and of no value. Well I think that applies to a lot of films I see now - they think of an idea and just force-feed it with 1.5 hours of zany characters and random outrageous events. That's certainly the case here and it's what I've been observing in comedies like this for years now. This leads me to conclude that either this genre of comedy has really had its day or ... well I'm just getting old! Still I am me, and me didn't enjoy this one bit.",The Sitter

60,amahlanand,A Sitting Duck,2,9 May 2012,"'The Sitter' turned out to be a sort of amalgamation between 'The Pacifier' and 'Are We There Yet?' but certainly less child friendly. Though, the mix was disappointingly devoid of even half a laugh. Jonah Hill returns in the shy but foul mouthed, jock aspiring comedic role that launched him to stardom in 'Superbad' where he is very much at home, but the script failed him miserably. As a matter of fact, the script failed the movie completely, the gags weren't all that original or even funny for that matter and the characters even less so to the extent that you ask yourself, what was the point? It tried the teen sex comedy angle which didn't work, it played the family comedy card at times which didn't work and then tried to salvage the whole thing with some 'heartfelt' themes which ended up really thrown in for the heck of it. Needless to say, that didn't work either. We're yet to see a one man show from Jonah Hill, he seems to work better in conjunction with other cast, oftentimes in a supporting role, and revolving a film around him alone was an unprofitable punt from director David Gordon Green. With barely anything remotely humorous and a meaningless plot, 'The Sitter' sat purposeless.",The Sitter
61,FilmStallion,The Sitter...0.5 out of 4 Skittles,1,6 September 2012,"The Sitter starring the uber-famous, used to be chubby funny man Jonah Hill as Noah, a fat unemployed slacker still living at home with his single mother (Jessica Hecht). Noah's mother guilts him into a babysitting job so she can go on a double date with the neighbors. The night of babysitting goes awry when Noah takes the kids out in their parents mini-van in search of first time sex with his new girlfriend played with usual ditsy club girl attitude by Ari Graynor. Think Adventures in Babysitting meets Superbad...without any of the humor.The Sitter falls flat in every way. The story is generic, the jokes unfunny & the outcome of every scene is predictable. Hill is so far away from his solid recent performances in Cyrus & Moneyball, and Pineapple Express & All the Real Girls director David Gordon Green continues his slide with this directorial follow up to the early 2011 bust Your Highness. The script by new comers Gatewood & Tanaka makes you wonder how it ever got made in the first place. Even an unusual performance by the usually great Sam Rockwell can't save this sinking ship.Any parents who may get tricked by their younger kids into thinking this could be a funny family film...think again, and take a closer look at the 'R' rating.

This movie made no sense and it questioned the intelligence of every movie goer in the world. The kids were acting as if they were given a concept of a movie child and then allowed by the director to ad-lib (badly). The resolution for the kids problems were so poorly done and the premise made me wish I never got on this ride. The blaxploitation of the 70's seemed to be revived in a gruesome side story which made me cringe. Sam Rockwell played his part with a comedic timing which made him a stand out in the whole thing. I am not sure what the movie says about today's entertainment writing in Hollywood. Jonah Hill acted as if he channeled the ""Greek"" movie into collaboration of improbably scenes. I guess the use of Method Man legitimized the ethnic scenes or something. I am pretty certain this production was not vying for the Academy Awards or the Golden Globe. The predictable story line just got dumber as it went on and on. This movie was about 45 minutes too long.",The Sitter
63,kdorsey321,The Sitter,7,3 January 2012,"Got a chance to check out the movie ""The Sitter,"" starring Jonah Hill, Sam Rockwell, and Ari Graynor. My honest first thought was ""Jonah Hill is in a movie. I have to see it. I know its going to be funny."" Then I was thinking, I don't know...Jonah playing a sitter. Then looking at the preview, it looked like something we have already seen before. You know the movie when the guy is watching the kids and the kids give him the day/night of his life. At the end of the day, Jonah in it and at the very least, he is going to give me a few laughs.To be honest, it was funnier than I thought it would be. This movie shows you that Jonah Hill can make something out of nothing in a movie. Even if its repetitive. Sam Rockwell was pretty funny too. He just has that voice that makes you laugh, plus J.B. Smoove was in there to keep the comedy rolling. Was it the funniest movie ever, no, but I was a little surprised I laughed as much as I did. You'll definitely get a couple good laughs out of this movie.Just for the record this is not a movie for kids. Do not take your kids to see this movie. That my kind of be one of the only problems with this movie. You have a movie with three kids in it and the movie is not kid friendly. This is a movie adults and teenagers would most likely enjoy.I love the soundtrack though out the movie and Method Man made a couple of cameo appearances. Its always nice to see music artist cross over and do acting. I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10. I'm giving this movie a 7 out of 10 because it was funnier than expected.

64,MC1-Bjornson,The Sitter is Litter,3,2 February 2012,"""The Sitter"", Rated ""R"" for Adult Situations, Profanity, Sexual Content & Violence. Running Time: 1hr.&21mns.My Take * (Out of ****)Ultra obscene comedies have been the rage this last decade. Today, is it possible to think of new ""R"" rated comedies that don't contain excessive vulgarities, graphic sexual situations, gross out humor and other excessive acts of chaos that stretch the bounds of what can be done in the movies? I don't remember ""R"" rated films being this over the top 15 years ago. Even ""R"" rated fare from the '80s seems really tame in comparison.The latest Jonah Hill vehicle ""The Sitter"" is supposed to be a comedy, though I cannot begin to understand why it was made or to whom this movie is marketed. Maybe on paper this film seemed like a much better idea than its silver screen offering.Jonah Hill plays Noah, a lazy college suspendee who once again lives at home with his mother. His supposed girlfriend Marisa (Ari Graynor), a self-serving party girl, uses him regularly to cater to her every whim. Due to financial woes and to help his mother out, Noah reluctantly agrees to babysit three kids: the high anxiety Slater (Max Records), the Jon Benet Ramsey wannabe Blithe (Landry Bender) and the young deviant Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez), who has an insatiable love for running away and cherry bombs. Naturally these kids live in a very well-to-do neighborhood with their trophy-wife mom and no-nonsense father. Noah's game plan is to stay home with the kids and keep an eye on them until their parents get home. In a movie like this, you just know there's no way that can possibly happen.Soon, the loser Noah is out to appease his girlfriend on a drug run with all three of his charges in the backseat as he rushes through the streets of Manhattan. The deal goes awry when young Rodrigo sneaks into Karl's (Sam Rockwell) body building gym and steals an egg from Karl containing over $10,000 in cocaine. The egg inevitably breaks and its powdery contents explode in Noah's face. All of the kids look on while Noah ponders his next move. Cocaine and kids. Now isn't this funny? Hahaha.Karl wants his ten grand for the stolen cocaine or else Noah's a goner. Pursued through the night, Noah and the kids go to a department store, attend a bar mitzvah, go to Noah's father's house, stop at wild party and are chased by thugs through a park. Meanwhile Slater comes to terms with his anxiety, Blithe ponders her place in the world as a child and the pint-sized demolition expert Rodrigo learns a thing or two about humility. Oh, I forgot to mention there's a scene where the little girl accidentally defecates herself and stinks up the entire van leaving everyone gasping for air with the windows down. Isn't that cute? Isn't that funny? Amidst all this craziness, Noah makes a connection with these children and shares with them his insights on life, how to cope with circumstances and how to become a better person. Who knew the man who would so recklessly endanger children with a trip to make a drug deal and to a wild alcohol binger would prove to be as insightful as Yoda? Why not? There's even a sweet co-ed from his college who can see what a nice guy he really is! Puh-lease.""The Sitter"" is an astonishingly bad movie. There is nothing even remotely funny about this picture. Seeing children involved in coke deals, beatings, and contemplating their sexuality (with one as a runway object and another dealing with personal orientation), blowing up everything in sight and get chased by vengeful drug dealers is absolutely appalling. I did fully expect the kids to use multiple f-bombs, as is par for the course with this kind of movie. There are movies with unlimited vulgarity that are funny. ""The Sitter"" is not among their ranks.I'm not trying to be a prude here. I don't object to the use of obscenities that dominate today's comedies. After all, what people chose to watch for entertainment is entirely their business. What is unsettling to me is how low for a joke will some filmmakers go. As I watched ""The Sitter,"" I was totally mind-boggled as to how far the movie would go to do that. When is enough ever enough? The folks behind ""The Sitter"" ought to be ashamed of themselves.One can only wonder why the likable Jonah Hill is in such a trainwreck of a movie. Does he have a horrible agent trying to sabotage his career? How about Sam Rockwell? He's such a versatile and talented actor. No doubt they are in ""The Sitter"" to collect a paycheck. Both actors have appeared in good movies and will hopefully continue to do so. There's no reason they should have been sidetracked to appear in this drudge.Next up for Jonah Hill is the updated big-screen makeover of the late 80s TV show ""21 Jump Street."" Hopefully that will be a return to comic form for Hill. He usually appears in funny, thoughtful movies, though on the risqué side. Who can say what went wrong this time? Well, I hope the filmmakers learned from their mistakes. We know there's a better Jonah Hill movie to be made. ""The Sitter"" can sit on it.",The Sitter
65,ArtandJoyofMovies,Abusive of Children--Skip it!,1,26 December 2011,"Do not go see or support this film. TMG will not endorse any movie that sexually exploits children, and neither should you. I was looking for Adam Sandler or Nic Cage to show up in this film. A ten year old little girl using the F word is just over the line. It is inexcusable. Worse, it is so unnecessary. Next, Hollywood will be showing an eight year old performing sexual acts. This is not funny. I am pretty certain under many state laws it is not even legal to coach a ten year old to use vulgarities and reference sexual acts. The obvious, apparent exception being University Park, Pennsylvania.Jonah Hill showed he can be a gifted actor if you saw Moneyball. He took a huge step backwards by showing he is still just a vulgar and obnoxious, fat boy. This is obvious from the first minute of the show when Hill is performing oral sex on a girl. The surprising thing is at least it was a girl. I don't think most Labradors would allow Hill to lick them. The movie just ""goes down hill"" from there. I will readily admit there is some funny content, but the net result is the moral equivalent of justifying Jerry Sandusky just because he was telling some really funny jokes in the shower.There is an overtly pro gay point of view pushed. This is fine for adults. Not for children. Only adults should be allowed anywhere near this film. Adults can decide for themselves what they believe in. Using children to to promote gay messages is just wrong. We see this recently with little children being coached to ask gay questions to politicians. Oh come on! Does any gay, adult person of sound mind really think this is the way to advance their agenda? Exploit children? Children who cannot even fully comprehend what they are saying? It is pathetic.It would be just as wring to use children to promote a transcontinental pipeline or taxation of the rich.

66,anacpcruz,Funny Enough,8,23 August 2015,"I describe this movie as funny enough. We know that the plot don't show nothing new. The fact that the flick display drugs and drug dealer's problems kind of adventures, make the story predictable. But the genius of Jonah Hill and his chemistry with the children make the film tolerable. Besides, in my opinion, a disastrous beginning, the story take form and the growth, development and improvement of the child characters increase the interest in the plot. The quality of the acting by the children was a surprise for me. They reveal serious talent for comedy, and the funniest scenes were protagonized by them. But the stereotype of the black community that speaks with that type of accent, the rich doctor father that have a beautiful wife and kids, but don't respect them entirely, already was so scripted and viewed. Over all was a laid back, funny, positive, not a memorial kind of comedy. But Jonah Hill is more and more considered in Hollywood also thanks to this light comedy films, that don't disappoints the audience or put a bad label on an actor's career.",The Sitter

68,YbsuhA,A really unnecessary movie.,5,16 March 2021,"How many stoner comedies have the concept of buying drugs or alcohol and drag it with them all across the city? Let me check: Pineapple Express, The Night Before, Good Boys, Booksmart, and probably the best: Superbad, which also stars Jonah Hill. Therefore, The Sitter seems like a movie that's only made to be made. It means that it's basically all the other movies (although some of them came out after this movie) with a new twist. Jonah Hill's a grown up ""babysitter"" now, and not the young guy from Superbad, who's afraid of buying alcohol when he's underage.This movie feels extremely unnecessary. It only has a few funny moments, the rest is lame. It at least tries to be funny at times, but it don't succed that well. Jonah Hill is as funny as he always is, and the others in the movie isn't directly bad. The funniest in the movie, is Sam Rockwell as the drug kingpin who's selling lots of drugs.

It was like a road movie, where the characters all shift a great deal & end up in completely different places than they started. I thought Jonah really managed to carry off this character - I found him authentic, non judgemental and very sweet in a really positive way. It was as if the main characters had therapy during this one night & came out having sorted some issues out. Some bits were cringeworthy - oh my god you don't do that with kids - but it was OK, everyone survived. It was very well observed - there was lots of truth in it, like the abusive girlfriend who is taking the mick because she can. The rich kids who are actually not that well looked after, and it takes a kind human with no hidden agendas to help them see what's happening. Lots of bonding and loyalty which is always heart warming. Amusing nutters. Really, what else does one want from a film?",The Sitter

I rarely laugh out loud ever, not usually seeing anything funny in what other people find funny. Maybe it's the way I'm wired, but this movie was way better than a lot of movies I've seen recently.The actors who played the kids were brilliant, too.*** Possible spoilers ahead. *** Shame that the movie ended rather abruptly. I'd have liked to see the reaction of the parents after returning home and being confronted with three changed children, and changed for the better. Also, I believe the director missed a trick with the attractive mother of said children. When she opened the door near the beginning of the movie, Noah couldn't keep his eyes off her breasts, and if she had later been shown happy and contented with Noah's stint as baby-sitter, and his triumph in having converted her kids into human beings, maybe she might have had a few minutes to attend to Noah's needs.

From what I know of rotten tomatoes that's pretty bad.I'm just kidding around - I know it wasnt a great movie, but I kept watching it by the time he gets to the gym to buy coke it had made me chuckle enough times for me to consider it worthwhile to at least give another 15 minuets or so of attention to.I knew everything was probably going to be all right, the drug dealer would be busted oh, none of the kids wouldn't die or be lost and that Jonah Hill would end up with the nice girl. I knew this as soon as he talk to her at the bar mitzvah.Incredibly stereotypical, similarly too many of Jonah Hill produced and starring things. Incredibly formulaic never heard on the brain usually mildly offensive not that I'm easily offended by cursing, sex or drug use but I hope you know what I mean. The most expensive part I found was that stereotypical portrayal of the black people in the club later at the park.Anyways I didn't go into this movie looking for a plot line, something I'd have to ponder or even something I remember for the rest of my life.

73,Kevbo1985,"The Funny Sporadic, The Drama Unwelcome, The Sitter Disappoints",3,4 April 2012,"As far as comedy goes, Jonah Hill has steadily made a name for himself as a star in the genre. Personally, his films have always been hit or miss for me, and I've come to the conclusion that his best work is reserved for those times when he has a solid, usually more naturally comedic, actor to support him. With The Sitter, he is already at a disadvantage; his main supporting actors are children and, for the most part, his abilities are front-and-center for the entire film, which was entirely his idea to begin with. The results are mixed at the best of times and, for the most part, lackluster in general.What immediately screamed at me about the opening sequence was ""trying very hard to get the audience's attention"". I won't spoil the scene for those who haven't seen the movie, but you'll agree with me once you do. Before I go much further, let it be known that I am an extremely big fan of lighthearted, irrelevant humor (Anchorman is one of my most loved comedies, for instance), and for the most part these are the sorts of films Jonah fits into. The Sitter tries to emulate the formula of many recent successful comedies in terms of witty one-liners and clever trade-offs between characters, occasionally seasoned with a bit of more physical comedy. It's an old system, of course, and something I've more or less come to terms with as being ""the norm"" in popular comedic cinema. But what disappoints me about The Sitter is how many times it whiffs on the concepts; seemingly custom-made situations for Jonah's quick, nonchalant wittiness are, for the most part, poorly written and performed. The more action-based comedic portions of The Sitter involve a child with a penchant for explosives and some vehicle shenanigans that are rather uninspired and bland without the accompanying depth of creative dialog and jokes.At some point, perhaps early on or perhaps towards the end, the movie takes a sudden shift into the dramatic, focusing on Jonah's character's relationship with his father or the troubles with his ""girlfriend"". These aspects of the film ring as hollow and somehow incomplete in the face of a heavy dose of relatively immature and inane comedy. The character development is far too sparse and, when it does take place, far too blunt and, again, uninspired to merit the delving into such intimate places. What does work, and this surprised even me, is how Jonah's character relates to the children he is babysitting. Being an eternal child at heart, Jonah's connection to his ward's problems feels perfectly natural and, in certain ways, touching to a degree. But ultimately it all feels out of place, like a scarecrow in an empty field; it would have a purpose if only it's surroundings were in better shape.The whole film moves at an increasingly agonizing pace at it becomes more and more clear that you're actually waiting for something funny to happen. Not to say it doesn't happen; but the consistency is so off that it ruins the entire project. There's a certain level of bland, uninspired atmosphere that permeates the film, oozing out of it like a thick mud you cannot remove yourself from. And when you finally do, when the mood lightens and you actually catch yourself grinning or maybe even shocked to hear a chuckle cross your lips, you raise your foot from the mud...only to find your shoe still stuck in it. Relief turns back into aggravation and, more than anything else, you just want it to end.",The Sitter

Well, so what if it was predictable? Most movies are, answer me this how many movies have you seen where you were genuinely surprised at the ending. So naturally, my expectations were lowered. But I thought the acting by the children was really good and Jonah Hill was as funny as usual. Also, it dealt with a prevalent issue in many kids' lives, coming out as gay. It dealt with this in a respectful and not overly-sentimental way.Basically this movie is not trying to bag an Oscar and it is not high- art melodrama stuff and it's not even close to being one of my favourite films.

There are some funny moments but they all stay at the average comedy level. I personally liked the role of Blithe (Landry Bender) best, her comments are sometimes hilarious. All in all a movie which, when taken not too seriously, is worth watching. Bad thing is the length: about 82 minutes is too short.

It's very adult at times in its language and content while at other times relying on cheap laughs you would expect from a Disney Channel cartoon. It's almost as if the director was thinking, oh kids would think this would be funny without thinking, this movie is absolutely not for kids! Other than that issue I had with the movie, the premise is just ridiculous. I'm supposed to believe that Noah, the babysitter, would set out on a crazy adventure with the kids he was babysitting, involving drugs and theft all so he could have sex with a girl who didn't even like him? I can suspend my disbelief with the best of them but come on, that a little overkill in the unbelievable department.To go along with the unbelievable story, were unbelievable characters. The children in this movie, mainly Rodrigo, did unthinkable things. Kids don't just carry around cherry bombs or pee in the middle of a high end restaurant. And if they did, their parents wouldn't be leaving them with a sitter, they would be locked in a closet in the attic.I did enjoy Jonah Hill despite the train wreck of a movie. He seems to be funny in whatever role he plays. Yes, many jokes fell flat but there are some people who are just funny, and I believe he is one of the few.I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone as at its best it's a very mediocre comedy and at its worst it's painful to watch.",The Sitter

I guess David Gordon Green is approaching his future directing in a different view; immaturity. David Gordon Green used to do movies based on the partnership on people in the movies (Pineapple Express and Your Highness) but with the Sitter, you sit down to watch this movie and you're automatic thought is....""what the hell is the point?"" That a 22 year old (fat) guy baby sits 3 children, one that is obsessed with everything she wears has to be ""hot"", one that is (secretly) gay, and one that is just a Hispanic asshole. The Sitter consists of the most raunchiest of all raunchy things that happen in one single night of babysitting. I laughed every now and then but what I was really laughing at was the fact that this poor attempt was an excuse for a movie rather than being a straight to DVD movie.",The Sitter

It was definitely funny.Jonah is adorable and all the other characters played their parts well. The story line was pretty crazy and the chaos stayed pretty heavy throughout the movie. There were several parts that definitely were un-realistic, but I guess a lot of the best comedies are this way.The not-so-great part of the movie was toward the end. It is one of those movies that seems like they ran out of material and just started throwing stuff together.Overall, though, it was very well done and I would say rent it!",The Sitter

I fail to see why, in this modern day, we are subjected to this kind of trashy, disgraceful garbage. There is no need for this film to exist, its humour, weak and un thoughtful. Its characters, 1 dimensional and entirely forgettable. Do not think me as harsh as I too enjoy the pleasures of mindless entertainment from time to time, alas this is far from entertainment, it seems as cinema evolves there are still many a mistake to be made, this is a prime example.Put your hard earned money to better use yet if you find that you must see this, wait, it will surly fall in price soon.",The Sitter
85,galaxychoco,Not that good,3,22 September 2013,This movie starts off pretty funny but after about 20/25 minutes into the movie its not funny anymore and it just gets very predictable. Basically the short version is the babysitter gets a call form his so called girlfriend telling him to get drugs he gets drugs but one of the kids steals from the dealer and now the dealer is chasing him. It gets a few laughs to start with but then gets boring and unwatchable. I wouldn't recommend this movie to most people but if you want to watch a predictable boring movie then this is the movie for you. Also throughout the movie the storyline seems to change going from whats happening to whats happening with the babysitters and the kids to the girlfriend to the kids parents to the babysitters mom.

87,laurencetuccori,Cringingly awful comedy that's superbad,1,4 March 2012,"Mere words cannot accurately describe the true awfulness of this alleged comedy. Imagine a group of minimally talented amateurs getting the opportunity to write, produce, direct and act in a multi-million dollar mainstream Hollywood movie about a reluctant babysitter who takes his charges on a night of wild adventure through New York and you'll start to graze the surface of the awfulness. I say minimally talented not to suggest that there are some glimmerings of talent on show here, but simply to acknowledge the fact that the boom mic stays out of shot, the camera doesn't fall over at any point, and no one blows their lines. Star Jonah Hill should be as embarrassed as heck about his participation in this lazy, sloppy unpleasant smelling film. He can't blame the writer and director because this project is his baby. He's one of the executive producers! What's even more explicable is that he made it immediately after his Oscar nominated turn in 'Moneyball.' That's self-inflicted reputation trashing on scale not witnessed since Cuba Gooding Jr's post 'Jerry Maguire' career. Co-star Sam Rockwell should also be ashamed. He overacts so ridiculously he makes Hill look good in comparison - and Hill is not good in this film. Not so much a disappointment as an insult, The Sitter is an absolute waste of time and money.see more of my reviews at http://thefilmivejustseen.blogspot.com/",The Sitter
88,tfbowler314,Jonah Hill as the sitter,8,25 May 2012,"This movie was so good. Too bad it wasn't G or PG for kids. That probably would have increased the hype of it. Normally, parents would hire sitters who have experience with child care. And how much did Noah have? None. It's like Adam Sandler as Sonny in big daddy. He did manage to keep the kids all together. But bring the kids to a bar?? Lol. Uh, that's R rated lol. He sure did have badass parenting skills. He's a sitter like no other. He was man enough to keep the kids away from the drugs.

But as the lead I'm not sure if 90 minutes or pure Jonah is going to keep my attention, or better yet, get me to watch a movie he's the lead in, as a supporting or even second fiddle, yes, but not as the lead. Unless of course there is a role or a movie that is a vehicle for him to show off brilliant comedic timing, and guess what, The Sitter was just that, or maybe I should say, it could have been just that. When I saw the trailer I was anxious for the release, if it would have been 80% as good as that I would have been ecstatic. Unfortunately, it kept on falling short. They set it up great. We met him, his 'life', the kids, the whole potential train wreck we just want to get on and then we go into it, and boy was I psyched. But then it just seemed like they were in a hurry to get to the next scene and the next scene and the next scene, and then the movie was over. There were so many scenes that could have been worked out more, either in the writing or in the execution. I wish they could have thought out each scene a little better.

In the end miraculously all problems are solved and each character embrace their shortcomings and make amends.Now on positive side the character of kids - the little girl as spoilt teenager, rebellious adopted Mexican boy and the kid with anxiety issue were interestingly sketched and enjoyable.

However Upon watching it I will tell you why.. It's Hilarious! The best part about the film is that it's relatable, not because I have a drug addicted girlfriend who doesn't love me (or go down on me) or that I owe a drug dealer thousands of dollars.. but because I am a young 22 year old lad who would be just as clueless as the next guy trying to babysit 3 little nightmares.The opening scene set the tone of the movie, and I thought Jonah Hill was at his witty best. I definitely recommend this film for anyone who is looking to kill 90 minutes on his day off from university because it's too rainy outside.Straight to the point,Tony from NZ.",The Sitter
93,Oliver-S-K,"Not a complete waste of time, but hardly worth it.",4,15 May 2012,"Noah Griffith (Jonah Hill) is a college dropout, who doesn't do sh*t and lives with his mother. She wants to go on a date, but a problem occurs; her double date partners don't have a baby sitter. A problem that can be solved with the reluctant Noah. Arriving at the scene, he's confronted with the timid, but handsome Slater (Max Records), the wannabe it-girl Blithe (Landry Bender) and Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez), an adoptee with a fell streak. The kids haven't even started to ruin Noah's evening, when he gets a call from his ""girlfriend"", who's at a party and needs some coke. Baited with the chance for intercourse, he loads the kids into the family minivan to meet up with Karl (Sam Rockwell), an artistic individual in the narcotics industry.Mediocre at best. Not a complete waste of time, but still hardly worth it. Let's have a look at some details, though. My first thought of the movie was: Jonah Hill is getting too old for these roles. Not that those deadbeat character comedies rely on credibility or have an age limit, but still, it's getting hard to believe. The kids are okay, well they're kids. And each of them has a small little problem, which gets solved during the course of the movie, to give them reason to be there, aside being part of the main story. But that's it, every time a small conversation and it's over. Most of the characters are semi- entertaining, with Sam Rockwell being the one that sticks out the most, even more than Jonah Hill, which is bad for a leading character. Which brings us to the main question of a comedy review: Is it entertaining? Yes, somewhat. You don't find yourself laughing all the time, but it does mostly have a slightly funny feeling. Then again, it's lacking originality and you might just smirk, because you knew what was coming.",The Sitter

It could have been for Jonah Hill, because I really like any film he's in. But I thought this film was good. It's nothing mind-blowing or anything. It's just a good way to pass 80-85 minutes. It has the character development, which most comedies lack. It has at least four laugh-out-loud moments. And enough story to make me wonder about what will happen.The premise may be a bit bad and a bit average. But the things that happen make it interesting. It also didn't rely on sex jokes, immature jokes and basically the kind of crap jokes you'd find in modern comedies such as Bridesmaids or American Pie. 7/10",The Sitter

The Sitter is full of crude humor with a basically non-existent plot. The whole thing seems sloppy and thrown together. Half of the time it was not apparent as to why some things were even included in the movie.

Noah helps Slater a lot in his acceptance of his sexuality by telling him how in college no one will care and how it is perfectly okay to be gay. Also Noah realises that his hot girlfriend is just using him and doesn't have any actual feelings for him and ditches her for a nicer girl from his old astronomy class who admits to have been too shy to talk to him at school. Finally Slater confronts Rodrigo about how scary he can be which helps Rodrigo to open up more to his new family meaning they can all get along better.So no this movie is not as bad as people are making it out to be, it is actually a very funny movie with a very good ending.",The Sitter

Jonah Hill is hilarious and the kids cast as his babysitting subjects are a lot of fun as well.The story is basically ""Adventures in Babysitting"" all over again with a few wrinkles. The premise is the same - babysitter takes kids into the city, things go wrong, danger ensues, etc etc. Jonah Hill makes this version work tho. Im a big fan of his, so i may be biased, but I think he is perfectly funny while still showing some heart as well. There's a weird side story involving his never-around father that feels unnecessary.

Noah has his moments of being a complete douche, also set with his moments of being kind hearted and well-intentioned deep down, in this one of many ""Babysitting Comedy"".The film lacks in the physical ""It's funny because he's fat"" type of humor Hill's characters have become notorious for (""Superbad"", ""Accepted"", ""Get Him To The Greek"") however Noah's dark/dry sense of humor and one liners will more than likely give you a couple laughs (at one point he refers to Blithe, the beauty-queen obsessed eight going on 25 girl he is babysitting, as ""Jon-Bene Ramsey"") especially if you're a teenager/young adult and a fan of his work. The kids, Slater (Max Reynolds), the awkwardly shy early teenager, Blithe (Landry Bender), see above for character description, and the mobster in training and arsonist, Rodrigo (Kevin Hernandez) all carry their own and in my opinion were good young actors, line delivery was believable, and each looked like they were having fun but all were able to provide touching, mature and vulnerable sides shaping their respective characters towards the end.As for the plot, some complain this movie is a blatant rip-off of ""Adventures in Babysitting"". But in reality, what is an ""Original"" babysitting movie? Most are going to recycle the plot of a reluctant babysitter getting stuck in a series of mishaps having taking the kids out, it mostly depends on the film to provide you with the right amount of laughs and not completely obvious plot turns, which I think The Sitter just did.If you're looking for a few laughs, I recommend this, if you're into most of David Gordon Green and/or Jonah Hill's other works the sense of humor is most likely for you.",The Sitter

I chuckled when the woman said ""B'yotch"", but other than that, it just didn't make me laugh. When I watch a comedy, I don't always look for a compelling storyline with deep characters, I'm looking for something to laugh about and reminisce about with my friends. It had a very generic idea, which has pretty much been reused, person has to babysit crazy kids, things go awry. Of course, this one includes drugs and violence, but even still, the whole thing was poorly executed. Characters seemed forced, and the main character is said to be some sort of slacker/loser but somehow can figure everyone out.I just think the movie had potential to be as hilarious as the trailers made it out to be.

This is a goofy comedy in which you must suspend disbelief continuously. That is all it was meant to be. It's just a babysitting movie, get it? Like all the rest, only it tries to bring a little freshness to the table ...and in my opinion, it does. It showcases Jonah Hill's amazing comedic talents, and we get to see some really good performances by some child actors too. Yes, it's Hill's signature shtick, but look closely and you'll see incredible timing and a guy who is extremely capable of carrying a movie. There are some good jokes written into it, but the film completely relies on the performances, and I doubt anyone associated with it would disagree (well, let's hope they wouldn't).In my opinion, most of the comedy works the way it was supposed to, and the few half-way serious moments do too. In terms of its edginess, it seems to up the ante on the simple formula flick that it is. It's safe to say that if it suits your sense of humor and you're willing to go for the ride, you'll have a good time. I wish people would quit over-analyzing movies like this.

Of course, it's not just what she says that makes everything happen, or Noah's attempts, it's what she asks, how he goes about it, where he has to go, what happens along the way, and how everything plays out. Which is all incredibly funny.I wanted to see this movie because it looked funny - raunchy and crazy, yet but funny. What I didn't know was that it would have some depth if not (and don't fault it for this) heart, too.The kids are rather archetypal, but not the kind that's usually seen portrayed. The little girl, Blithe (Landry Bender) wants to be a celebutante, wears a ton of makeup and is waayyy too into songs with lyrics inappropriate for someone her age (maybe anyone's age). There are a lot of girls (really young ones) who are into looking older, wearing makeup, etc right now. Her character and the reaction to her fit.It's not a deep, dramatic movie so there's not big, epic scenes of emotion, but I thought the little bits (mostly wit the kids) that were put in there were nice and still fit within the story.Overall, it's a very funny movie - even more so than I expected - there's enough just random stuff in it to keep it from being predictable even if all of it isn't the most original story line ever.

The racist stuff really bothered me but ultimately it fails just because it wasn't funny.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 for the black girl love interest, who was the only normal person in the movie (except that she looks like a supermodel and was too shy to talk to a fat, ugly jerk in her astronomy class).",The Sitter

There were very few funny parts, yet it was not entirely terrible. Jonah Hill's character is similar to past roles he's played is talked into babysitting by his mom and he has quite a night with the three kids. He and the rest of the cast, especially he little girl he babysat and the drug lord, played by Sam Rockwell, played their roles quite well. Considering the horrible writing, this was quite a feat for the cast. ""The Sitter"" didn't totally disappoint me but i feel as if it could have been a lot funnier. I did like some of the sugary sweet scenes with his mom and the kids he sat for. So, in conclusion, it is more of a drama/comedy and it is not for young children due to it's R rating.

That sounds like a recipe for a laughable 81 minutes. Sit back and enjoy the ride.Or not. The movie is flat out unfunny. I couldn't tell if the writers weren't trying at all, or trying way too hard. Pineapple express was hilarious, even if you watched it without being high. If I was baked out of my brains, I still wouldn't be able to find this movie funny. That's how bad it is. I saw nearly 30 people walk out half way through. They were the smart ones, because the second half is worse than the beginning. Spare yourself the frustration. Go spend your money elsewhere.",The Sitter
118,mailbox5000-256-687596,Funny and Hip,8,3 January 2012,"It's funny. It's hip. It's current. An 8 year old girl obsessed with being a celebrity = funny. An adopted pyromaniac = funny. A babysitter taking them along to get cocaine = funny. It's not a laugh out loud all the time movie, more of a chuckle and want to see what's next, but that's cool. Oh, and it has a team of gay rollerskating HGTV guys. FUNNY. We all know Jonah hill is good. The other actors are good enough, the little girl is great. It even has method man, yes method man. He doesn't have a large part but that's OK. It isn't slow, it moves nicely from scene to scene. If you like dirty humor and silly situations, go for it. It's 3 out of 4 stars. 8 out of 10.",The Sitter

120,SKhumbani,"Funny movie, wrongfully derided by critics who lack taste",9,17 December 2012,"This is a Jonah Hill comedy people. It's all about crude and cringe humor here. He does it well and so do the three children characters and bizarre cast. Stereotypes and clichés create the humor here. People have been far too critical of this one, I rank it as a A- or a 9/10. If your watching a comedy critically, you might be better off watching something else...All of the characters resemble normal types of people, each with their own inadequacy which contributes to the laughs. You cannot say you like 'superbad' but then don't like this one. The only options are to like both or to not like both; because they are the same style and roughly equally hilarious.",The Sitter
121,rayrups,A good movie,7,9 September 2012,"I enjoyed The Sitter. I have to say, I don't think this is Jonah Hill's best work, but I found it to be funny. This movie contains classic Jonah Hill, just as you would see in Knocked Up or Super Bad. There are always points in a Jonah Hill movie where you have to sit and say where in the world did he come up with that, which this movie definitely contains. This movie actually reminds me a lot of Super Bad. The wild night that happens after the parent's leave Jonah with their kids is quite similar in terms of chaos. The interaction that happens between the kids and Jonah throughout the night proves to be quite comical. Each kid is very different from one another which makes it difficult for Jonah to handle. The ridiculous situations that Noah put's himself and the kids in also make the movie worth watching. In one point of the movie he takes the kids to a bar where they are playing pool and dancing. The whole ""worst babysitter ever"" label which the movie slaps on Jonah, which is made event by the decisions he makes throughout the night, really works well to produce a good comedy.",The Sitter
