0,Leofwine_draca,Fast paced but cheesy,4,21 December 2013,"Texas Chainsaw is the latest movie in the long-running series and a film that aims to be a direct sequel to the Tobe Hooper original, pretty much discounting the various others that have come along since. To be honest, these movies have such a gruelling premise that it's difficult to go wrong with them; a premise that screams horror and disturbing imagery all the way, so you'd have to be a really bad filmmaker to screw it up.This film feels very much like a modern horror movie. It's incredibly fast paced, with action going on all the while; a film filled to the brim with chase scenes, quick-fire dialogue and constant movement. It ups the gore quotient considerably, so that we're subject to bodies being chainsawed in half and the like, while at the same time the genuinely disturbing atmosphere of the first film is long forgotten. It's horrible, but not horrifying. There's something cartoon-like about watching Leatherface on the rampage here.Unfortunately, the story does take some very silly twists along the way, particularly towards the climax, and the ending is very poor. Not only does it feature a horrible bit of CGI effects work, it mixes up and muddles its morals and features some unbelievable behaviour on the part of the characters. I had the feeling things would turn out this way but it's too abrupt and nonsensical compared to what's come before, the tone is all wrong.Still, it's not all bad. The cast are young and hip, and give some not-bad performances although they don't really wow you. The person making the least impact is Scott Eastwood; you register him as Clint's son from appearance alone, and certainly not from acting talent. Still, Alexandra Daddario is fine as a potential scream queen and it's nice to see her given the opportunity to shine in a leading role after playing support in the likes of PERCY JACKSON AND THE LIGHTNING THIEF. The direction isn't too bad, and the early scenes tying it into the original work well, but this is light, cheesy and forgettable fluff in the end, nothing more.",Texas Chainsaw
1,SnoopyStyle,Sacrilegious but Horror is suppose to take on the sacred,7,21 January 2014,"This movie starts with the 1974 movie. After Sally escaped, police officer Hooper goes to the Sawyer house and tries to arrest Leatherface. However an angry mob gets to the house and massacres the family instead. One of the mob kidnaps a surviving baby. Years later, that baby is now young Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario). Suddenly she inherits an estate from a grandmother she didn't even know she had. She goes back to Newt Texas with 3 friends (Trey Songz, Tania Raymonde, Keram Malicki-Sánchez) and a hitchhiker (Shaun Sipos). There they encounter Leatherface who's been kept in the basement. Only there are more villains than the chainsaw wielding brute.There is a flip in this movie. It's tantamount to blasphemy. It's probably why there are so many haters. But I almost feel like it's a badge of honor for a horror movie to flip the accepted view on its head. If you can't destroy the sacred in a horror movie, then where are we going to do it.The best thing in this movie is Alexandra Daddario. It reminds me why I had her as one of my preferred choice to be Wonder Woman. Now I hate the Gal Gadot selection even more. She holds the movie even better than Jessica Biel. She's super hot. She can act. She has physicality. This is a well acted, well filmed, and an interesting take on the franchise.",Texas Chainsaw
2,nogodnomasters,DO YOUR THING CUZ,7,4 August 2018,"This is one of the weirdest, unexpected sequels since Halloween 3. The film opens with a quick flashback and picks up exactly where the last one leaves off. The police, along with some vigilantes torch the Sawyer house with the murdering cannibals inside. A little girl is saved and raised by one of the vigilantes. Now that she is grown, (Alexandra Daddario) Heather discovers she is adopted and the sole heir to the Sawyer plantation in Texas.She travels there with 3 college mates and picks up a person along the way, because the unwritten code of a Texas Chainsaw movie is the hitchhiker/rider. As it turns out, she is not the only heir left and you come to sympathize with the cannibal with a chainsaw.The film has its share of severed bodies, blood, and gore. The 3D action is climaxed with a chainsaw tossed at the camera. Remember this is a sequel. Keep the expectations low.Parental Guide: F-bombs. Implied sex. No nudity. Tania Raymonde bra/panties. Alexandra Daddario open shirt cleavage...and how did her shirt become buttoned shut once it was ripped open?",Texas Chainsaw
3,kosmasp,Follow up,5,10 August 2013,"I only watched this in 2D, so I can't comment on the 3D effect, though some scenes looked like they must have been real fun with the extra dimension. The movie itself tries to extend the legacy of the first movie, which it doesn't succeed in completely. But I also think it would be unfair to say it sucks on every level.Unfair to the wonderful leading lady and unfair to the filmmakers who tried to make this work, as good as they could. Of course there are inconsistencies (age of our lead character might be an issue if you're looking for things that make no sense), but the movie itself is a nice little movie. Female leads are better than their male counterparts, that's for sure and you do get your fair share of clichés thrown into the mix. You can still have some fun and the effects are pretty good too",Texas Chainsaw
4,gavin6942,Pretty Bad,4,9 January 2014,"A young woman (Alexandra Daddario) travels to Texas to collect an inheritance; little does she know that an encounter with a chainsaw-wielding killer (Dan Yeager) is part of the reward.There are two nice things I can say about this film: one, it was a good idea to have returning actors, even if not in the same roles. Marilyn Burns is especially a treat. And two, there is a respectable continuity here... though how much it cancels out he sequels is unclear.That said, IGN editor Eric Goldman wrote, ""A few fun 3D-aided jump-scares aside, Texas Chainsaw 3D is a generic and laughable attempt to follow the original."" I did not watch the 3D version and cannot comment on that, but otherwise he is right. This is straight-to-video quality somehow passed off for theaters (and turning a profit). The opening credits were annoying, a few good scenes filled the middle, and then it went downhill again...",Texas Chainsaw
5,jboothmillard,Texas Chainsaw,3,29 January 2017,"When I heard about this sequel, I assumed it was a follow-up to the remake series started in 2003, in fact it is a direct follow-up of the original 1974 film, ignoring the events of the original second, third and fourth films, I gave it a chance, directed by John Luessenhop (Takers). Basically it continues straight after the events of the original, where victim Sally has escaped from a chainsaw wielding maniac (originally Gunnar Hansen), the police and townspeople have surrounded the Sawyer farmhouse in Newt, Texas. Corrupt Mayor Burt Hartman (Paul Rae) leads the group who want revenge against the family who aided the murders of Jedidiah ""Jed"" Sawyer, aka Leatherface (Dan Yeager), the arsonists who burn down the house are praised as heroes, the Sawyer family are presumed all dead. Unbeknownst to most townspeople, a surviving infant relative, Edith Sawyer, is found in the farmhouse, she is adopted by the Millers, Gavin (David Born) and Arlene (Sue Rock), who rename her Heather. Years later, Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario) is notified that her estranged grandmother, Verna Carson (Marilyn Burns), has died, leaving her everything, this is how Heather discovers she was adopted. Heather is travelling to Newt, Texas to collect her inheritance, she is joined by her boyfriend Ryan (""Simply Amazing"" singer Tremaine 'Trey Songz' Neverson) and their friends, Nikki (Lost's Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (Keram Malicki- Sánchez), along the way they also pick up hitchhiker Darryl (Final Destination 2's Shaun Sipos). They arrive and Heather is given the keys to the family house by the Sawyer family attorney, Farnsworth (The Fugitive's Richard Riehle), Heather is excited about the property she now owns, she and her friends decide to stay the night. The group go to get supplies, leaving Darryl to look after the house, he begins to loot the house and breaks into a locked door in the cellar, Leatherface appears and kills him. Heather and her friends return to find the place ransacked, but they choose to ignore this, Kenny prepares dinner and finds the room where Daryl was killed, Leatherface attacks and impales him on a meat hook. Heading upstairs Heather finds a decomposed body, she is knocked unconscious by Leatherface before she can alert anyone, she wakes in Leatherface's room, but manages to escape, while Leatherface cuts Kenny in half with a chainsaw. Hearing the screaming and the chainsaw, Ryan and Nikki find Leatherface and flee, Heather is in the van and the three of them drive away, but Leatherface causes the van to crash, killing Ryan and leaving Nikki unconscious, Heather crawls out and escapes. Leatherface retreats as Heather runs through a nearby carnival, Sheriff Hooper (Space Jam's Thom Barry) questions her and realises Leatherface is still alive, Mayor Hartman sends Officer Marvin (James MacDonald) to the Sawyer house to kill Leatherface, the officer is startled by Nikki and accidentally shoots her, before Leatherface kills him. At the police station, Heather looks through files that have been left out, relating to the murders in 1974, she learns of her family's fate and flees, she is found by the Mayor's son Deputy Carl Hartman (Scott Eastwood), but in fact he is working as an accomplice to Mayor Hartman and Ollie (Ritchie Montgomery), who was part of the Sawyer house arson. Carl leaves, Heather is tied up in the slaughterhouse to lure Leatherface, before he is about to kill her, she convinces him that they are related, she is his cousin, he frees her, the men start attacking Leatherface. At first Heather runs for her life, but hearing his agony she decides to help her cousin, Heather kills Ollie with a pitchfork, while Leatherface uses his chainsaw to force Mayor Hartman into a meat-grinder. In the end Heather reads Leatherface a letter given to her, from Verna, telling her that Leatherface will protect her as long as she cares for him, without any words, she agrees to stay and confirms her loyalty to him. Also starring Bill Moseley as Drayton Sawyer, Gunnar Hansen as Boss Sawyer, Dodie L. Brown as Loretta Sawyer, David Bell as Bear Sawyer, John Dugan as Grandpa Sawyer / Grandfather and Samuel McKinzie as Young Leatherface. Daddario is absolutely gorgeous, she does fine as the victim who turns relative, Eastwood is okay in his short time, but it's a shame that Leatherface doesn't look like he did previously, his skin mask is unconvincing. This film was original released in 3D, but that doesn't do anything to the quality, I will agree with critics that it is predictable and rehashing stuff we've seen before, but I couldn't help but revel in the amount of gory violence and blood spill in this instalment, with chainsaws, meat hooks and many other nasty tools and methods, a not completely awful horror. Adequate!",Texas Chainsaw
6,BA_Harrison,The worst of the Texas Chainsaw movies.,4,4 May 2014,"Although I find it way too bonkers not to be an enjoyable watch, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation (1994) has long been considered by many TCM fans to be the worst movie in the popular horror franchise; I expect Texas Chainsaw 3D to change quite a few of those opinions.A direct sequel to Tobe Hooper's 1974 original, this disrespectful trash messily rewrites the history of the Sawyer clan (suddenly introducing an extended family) before moving the action to the present day, when drop-dead-gorgeous twenty-something Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario)—who according to the TCM time-line would actually be 39—discovers that she was not only adopted as a child, but is also heir to a sprawling Texas mansion.Accompanied by her thoroughly unlikeable and untrustworthy friends, Heather takes a road trip to Texas where she checks out her new home, little realising that Leatherface (Dan Yeager) is lurking in the basement, ready to get busy with his trusty power tool.Although Texas Chainsaw 3D does admittedly deliver in the gore department (albeit with the help of some crap CGI), almost everything else about the film comes as a massive disappointment: the 3D effects are predictably cheesy (mostly comprising of unimaginative shots of the blade whirring in the foreground) and the dumb script features irritating characters, lousy dialogue ('do your thing, cuz') and increasingly ridiculous plot developments.Worst of all, delicious Daddario doesn't even strip off to take a shower or have sex; given just how cheap and tacky the rest of the film is, this should have been a given.",Texas Chainsaw
7,paul_haakonsen,The saw has been taken off the shelf...,6,4 May 2013,"Was this 2013 ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" movie necessary to the franchise? Well, that would depend on from where you are sitting. If you, like me, have grown up with the franchise, then the answer is no. However, if you are a newcomer to the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise, then the answer is yes, as this movie is actually a good way to introduce a new audience to the franchise and spur on an interest in watching the older movies.Storywise, then ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" was adequate, though it didn't really bring about anything overly new or great to the franchise. However, having grown up with the older movies, there were plot holes and stuff that just didn't really make much sense. But for a new audience, I can see why this movie would be good and interesting, as it is a fairly straight-forward horror/slasher movie with ingredients from the good old late 80's and early 90's horror/slasher movies.There was a good amount of gore and ghastly scenes in the movie, so on that aspect this 2013 movie does cater well to the audience of the older movies, as well as being able to shock and terrify a new audience. The effects were good, brutal and to the point. However, there was an unnecessary excessive amount of blood in the movie. Especially from the blood trail on the floor. I am sure that no one would have bled that much in any situation!Moving on to the list of casted actors and actresses. Well, I think people did good jobs with their given characters, though the characters had a tendency of turning out a big one-sided and lacking dimensions. It wasn't really characters that you formed any kind of bond with or had any fictive emotions for. They were mainly just fodder for the saw, and that is how they were perceived. I was initially worked out about seeing Bill Moseley was going to be in this movie, and imagine my disappointment when he was only there for less than five minutes. That was a shame. But hey, it was nice to see him revisit and old iconic role of his.Now the most controversial aspect of the movie, prior to others is the way that Leatherface is given a human-like personality that we as an audience have go to get sympathetic about. Whether or not you like this is individual, of course, but personally I think it was a tad too much. You don't take a maniacal serial killer and try to make him human. Not Leatherface, not Jason, not Michael, and not Freddy, it just doesn't bode well.All in all, then ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is an enjoyable movie in itself, and it actually managed to pull off a reinvention better than the ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" movie back from 2003. So thumbs up on that.",Texas Chainsaw
8,Coventry,Cousin Leatherface's bloody one-man-show!,4,4 April 2018,"The ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series is by far the most confusingly inconsistent and randomly structured horror film franchise in history! Please allow for a natural born horror geek like myself to provide, at the end of this user-comment, an overview. I'm not starting with it, in order not to scare off or put to sleep neutral readers. So, first the review! ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" - which I actually saw in regular 2D - is a perfectly enjoyable and extremely brutal trash/gore flick, as long as you manage to overlook the giant gaps in continuity, the complete lack of logic in the script, the blandness of the lead characters and the utterly dumb plot twists. Everything starts out quite incorrect already. The intro supposedly takes place right after the events of Tobe Hooper's original in 1974. The Sawyer-baby who survives the family massacre then receives an inheritance letter in 2012. That would make her at least 38 years old, yet Heather is depicted by the fresh-faced Alexandra Daddario who's clearly still in her early twenties! You know you're in trouble when the director doesn't even bother to do the math. It gets worse when cute Heather decides to go and visit the farmhouse estate in rural Texas that she inherited, together with her adulterous boyfriend and unreliable girlfriend. Heather didn't bother to read her grandmother's letter in advance, so they painfully experience that her maniacal and chainsaw-wielding bastard cousin Leatherface still lives in the basement. Apparently, her grandma (cool cameo for Marilyn Burns) managed to keep his survival secret and his presence hidden all these years, even though the entire redneck town knows what happened and scrutinizes the estate. Following a totally absurd sequence at the police station, we're supposed to believe that the Sawyers were poor victims (even though they slaughtered innocent campers in the 70s and Leatherface still cheerfully saws people in half), while the rest of the town (led by the foul-mouthed Mayor Hartman) are the real psychopaths. I think it's abundantly clear to state that director John Luessenhop and his team of four (!) writers couldn't care less about a half-decent story. For as long as Leatherface is running around with his buzzing chainsaw like an idiot, or when Alexandra Daddario hangs tied up with her shirt unbuttoned, everything is alright for them. And, in all fairness, ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" sure does deliver in the blood & gore department. Leatherface's mask may look tacky, but he ""does his thing"" with the chainsaw quite well. Even in 2D, you can tell that the 3D effects are clichéd and obvious (flying chainsaws, whirring blades coming at you, etc...) but I bet these gimmicks impressed lots of inexperienced horror fanatics wearing their goggles in theaters. As promised, an overview of the bizarre TCM franchise history. In 1974, Tobe Hooper and Kim Henkel changed the horror scene forever with their bare-bones but ultimately raw grindhouse masterpiece, loosely based - like so many other contemporary titles - on the sickening crimes of Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. The legendary tagline alone (""Who will survive and what will be left of them"") was groundbreaking. Even though the film was an unexpected hit and spawned countless of rip-offs, it took no less than 12 years before the first sequel got released. Tobe Hooper directed it himself and, strangely enough, drastically changed the tone from raw and disturbing to absurd and slapstick. With Bill Moseley stealing the show as Chop Top, Leatherface's role in this sequel is rather limited and he even falls in love at one point! To compensate for Leatherface's supportive role in part 2, the second sequel got named after him. ""Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III"" came out in 1990, and it's probably the least conspicuous installment of the entire franchise. The series hit rock-bottom in 1994, when the original co-writer Kim Henkel came up the pretty retarded ""The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Up until this point, the series evolved quite chronologically. But then in 2003 came a (poor) remake of the 1974 original. That film received its own prequel in 2006, rather boringly called ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"", which was a lot better than expected. ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is supposedly a direct sequel to the 1974 original, but in 2017 there came another prequel named ""Leatherface"". None of the sequels/prequels seem to take into consideration the previous films, by the way. In ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"", we're led to believe that Leatherface has always been mentally handicapped, but in the 2017 prequel he's depicted as a normally functioning adolescent. Eight films, seven different actors to play Leatherface, but the only one everybody remembers is Gunnar Hansen.",Texas Chainsaw
9,michaelRokeefe,I'm related to a chainsaw killer?,5,13 November 2018,"Just mentioning Leatherface draws interest in a movie. Draw 'em in, but how long can you keep them in the seats? Not the best, but not exactly the worst either. A pretty young Heather Miller (Alexandria Daddario) doesn't have any idea what to do with her life; but she would like to go west. Things will change when she gets notice that she has inherited an estate in Texas from a deceased Grandmother she has never known. With friends, Heather heads to Texas to sign the papers for a lavish, isolated Victorian mansion. Mighty impressive until she stumbles upon what is stored away in the mansion's cellars. And then there is the redneck relative wielding a chainsaw.

10,Hey_Sweden,"""A chainsaw don't make you bulletproof!""",5,12 October 2014,"The writers of this one try to develop the familiar story of the Texas cannibal family in different ways, but ultimately what we get is the same-old, same-old, done in a typical modern style. On a visceral level, it's watchable, but it's got more than its share of silly and groan-inducing moments. (""Do your thing, cuz!"" is just one of them.) Yeah, there's lots of splatter, and the presentation favours a very action-oriented approach. The obvious victims- to-be are a pretty nondescript and dull bunch; performances are either annoying or passable.It functions as a direct sequel to Tobe Hooper's classic ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", picking up shortly after the point that the original ends. The Sawyer homestead is attacked and burned to the ground by vigilantes, and during the mêlée a baby is able to survive. Some 20 odd years later, that baby, Heather (Alexandra Daddario) receives word that her grandmother has passed away. Part of her inheritance is the old family home, which is housing a certain character in its basement. When Heather and her friends come to the place to check it out, he'll be out to stalk and slaughter the stupid with his trusty chainsaw.A chase sequence through a carnival seems pretty contrived, and far too often ""Texas Chainsaw"" is utterly lacking in atmosphere and any sense of a build. Sure, the pacing is very fast, but there's too much nonsense from our characters. There's still some vicarious entertainment in seeing them meet such hideous ends. The opening sequence, featuring series alumni Gunnar Hansen, John Dugan, and Bill Moseley, is fun, in any event; it's supplemented by archive footage from Hoopers' film. The development of the Heather role is moderately amusing, and in this scenario Leatherface really isn't the primary antagonist.Dan Yeager is adequate as Leatherface, no more and no less. Clint Eastwoods' son Scott plays the role of the young cop Carl, Richard Riehle (""Chillerama"") plays a lawyer, and Marilyn Burns turns up near the end. Along with Hansen, Dugan, and Moseley, she does help to create some audience goodwill. But ""Texas Chainsaw"" is, ultimately, indistinguishable from lots of other horror product these days.Five out of 10.",Texas Chainsaw
11,zardoz-13,Teaching An Old Chainsaw New Tricks,5,6 January 2013,"Hollywood loves to teach old dogs new tricks. Christopher Nolan re-imagined the ""Batman"" franchise, and it will never be that good again. George Lucas rebooted ""Star Wars."" Now, Disney is preparing a new ""Star Wars"" trilogy, not to mention the reboot of ""The Lone Ranger."" The people who made the new entry in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise are trying to teach an old chainsaw new tricks. Numerically, ""Texas Chainsaw 3-D""is the sixth sequel to Tobe Hooper's landmark slaughterhouse saga ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" that alarmed audiences with only half as much blood and twice as much storytelling. Squeamish people should avoid this bloodthirsty idiocy. You get to see a grown man cut in two by a chainsaw wielding maniac. This same stout lad saws off feet at the ankles as casually as you would snip your fingernails. He places living people on meat hooks and stores half-dead women in freezers. Basically, ""Takers"" director John Luessenhop and scenarists Adam Marcus, Debra Sullivan, and Kirsten Elms have eliminated four decades worth of sequels, prequels and remakes and want us to look at ""Texas Chainsaw 3-D"" as the new official sequel to the 1974 film. Sounds like somebody got their chainsaws tangled up. The filmmakers beg our indulgence when it comes to any real sense of time, too. This ""sequel"" doesn't happen 18 to 25 year later. Luessenhop and company make a huge leap of faith. In the process, they give us something far more horrifying than just another sequel. ""Texas Chainsaw 3"" is a revisionist sequel! In the 1950s, Hollywood rehabilitated Indian savages and made them noble and sympathetic. Essentially, ""Texas Chainsaw 3-D"" treats Leatherface the same way that westerns treated Indians in the 1950s. One scene near the end presents tableaux between Leatherface and a relative that reminded me of George and Lenny from the classic 1939 movie ""Of Mice and Men."" This John Steinbeck movie concerned a mentally challenged brute and his intelligent guardian. Horror has a new mask! Timelines tangled up or not, our heroine, Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario of ""The Babysitters""), works at a meat packing factory. When she isn't at work, Heather spends quality time with her African-American lover, Ryan (Tremaine ""Trey Songz"" Neverson), who isn't above cheating on her with her own friend. The best friend, Nikki ( Tania Raymonde of""Wild Cherry""), has no fear of being caught and does everything but flaunt their extra curricular romance in front of Heather. Moreover, Nikki has her own boyfriend, Kenny (Keram Malicki-Sánchez of ""American History X""), who gets preoccupied in the kitchen cooking.This unsuspecting quartet cruises off to Newt, Texas, when Heather learns she has received an inheritance from a long, lost grandmother who she didn't know. Along the way to Newt, the quartet pick up body-building hitchhiker who has a secret history of his own that comes back to haunt him. When they arrive at the house on Homestead Road, the realtor meets them but declines to join them after they proceed through the gates onto the premises. Heather is still reeling from the revelation that the couple that raised her weren't her actual parents. The father rescued her from the clutches of a dying woman when the Sawyers were gunned down by vigilantes and their home burned to the ground. Anyway, the realtor hands Heather a letter and advises her to read it. Naturally, Heather ignores the letter when her friends and she discover that this is no ordinary house but a palatial mansion with many rooms. Curiosity leads to carnage when the man in the basement, none other than Leatherface (Dan Yeager of ""Metal Heads""), emerges for a look-see and begins carving flesh. You get to guess who his first victim is. He cuts his way through a number of people before he realizes blood is thicker than chainsaws. Heather grovels at his mercy as she was herself about to be slaughtered by the evil town mayor who precipitated an orgy of violence that brought her back to her destiny. The switching chainsaws plot to ""Texas Chainsaw"" is imaginative stuff. Nevertheless, before the villain is rehabilitated, several people have joined the ranks of the dead. The best scene—again out of any coherent time-line—has a deputy sheriff walking through the mansion following the smeared trail of blood with wrists crossed, and a pistol in one grip and an iPhone in the other, documenting his progress through the house down into the cellar where he gets to see bodies carved up in all shapes. Luessenhop generates a moderate amount of suspense and buckets of blood and gore, but ""Texas Chainsaw 3-D"" cannot cut it as the classic that the original was.",Texas Chainsaw

Little does she know who lives in the basement. We do, though.There are no major surprises here. Fans of gore will be pleased at the gory bits, but they are relatively sparse. Heather's friends are so poorly drawn that they have no function other than to be slaughtered. The other characters serve their plot functions well enough, but no more. The dialogue is tripe - at one point the cop who is following a trail of blood along a dimly lit floor where our chainsaw maniac has dragged fresh victims into his basement lair actually says, ""I have a bad feeling about this"" and I burst out laughing.Miss Daddario, last seen as a 24 year old teenager helping Percy Jackson, spends most of the film in jeans cut so low that you can count her groins (I'll save you a job - two), with a bosom so jutty you could take shelter from a thunderstorm under it. She is offered a clean shirt at one point, and takes the opportunity to discard not only her bloodstained old shirt, but also her bra. Which wasn't even dirty.

It opens with numerous sequences from the 1974 original film that many will prefer to watch as oppose to this one. It opens with corrupt Texas citizens torching the farm house that homed the family of cannibals but a baby is spared when the mother is killed and she is raised unaware of her real birthright. When she receives an inheritance from the grandmother she never met she begins to question who she really is. She and some friends drive out to the farm house and a survived Leatherface butchers them one by one in graphic detail hooking victims on meat hooks or just plainly sawing them in half. This is disgusting with many corny references to the original film. We have morons who fail to listen to reason such as the cop who ventures into the house only to have his face removed. This house is intriguing with it array of mazes and corridors but with Leatherface being made a sympathetic character leaves one to wonder who the heroes really are. To add to the mentality and intelligence of the characters they pick up a hitchhiker and then allow him ample opportunity to rip them off until Leatherface decides to rip him up. Alexandra Daddario is the one performance worth its salt as she becomes increasingly aware that her life as been a lie. Everyone else lines up to become the latest examples of what wrongful uses for a chainsaw can result in. Score: 2 ½ / 10",Texas Chainsaw
15,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Fantastic, near-flawless entry in the series",10,13 July 2015,"After learning she has inherited a family estate, a woman and her friends decide to visit the house in rural Texas only to realize the dark family secret kept from her when a hulking, chainsaw-wielding maniac emerges from within the house.Overall this one was a blast and one of the better entries in the series. What works the best here for this one is the fact that there's just an insanely addictive atmosphere present over this one that tends to keep the film moving along nicely, as the opening scenes of them going through the house with it's grand, majestic style and old-school opulence set-up the story nicely while giving this a rather impressive feeling of dread with the hidden cabinets and corridors behind the facade that make for a grand time here. Along with the rather spectacular mystery here featuring the discovery of her past identity and how that got kept from her, the first half here is a compelling mystery angle that goes on quite nicely to set-up the action later on with the emergence of Leatherface in a fantastic sequence overall that echoes his first appearance in the original. That in turn leads into a lot of quality action scenes here with the chase through the basement when the thief discovers his hiding spot, the capture of the boyfriend in the barn which leads into another thrilling chase through the house out into the cemetery in the backyard and finally the big action scene in the escape attempt in the car as the stalled car and slow-opening gates allows him to catch them which brings about the flee through the woods and finally ends up with the chaos at the carnival which is a non- stop and truly enjoyable sequence all around. The big brawl at the factory also comes off nicely with the great gore present and there's an outstanding scene where a lonely officer walks through the house following a blood-trail on the floor that leads down into the basement, which all make for quite a fun time overall here. There's really only one area this one falls short under, which is the change in family relationship in the final half. Despite this one going for a cleverly- done manner of integrating this one into the time-line of the franchise, the fact that doing so does change around a large number of points in the story that aren't really addressed or just glossed over here, from the reaction to her friends' deaths and the town to the connection between the two which isn't handled all that well. While the 3D gags are again woeful and disappear from here so often it's possible to forget the film was intended in that manner, this here is the main issue holding this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity, a clothed sex scene and brief drug use.",Texas Chainsaw
16,FlashCallahan,Do your thing Cuz.....,5,26 May 2013,"After 1974, the Texan townspeople suspected that the Sawyer family were responsible. A mob of enraged locals surrounded the Sawyer house, burning it to the ground and killing every last member of the family. Decades later, Heather learns that she has inherited a Texas estate from her grandmother. she decides to bring her friends along on the road trip to investigate her inheritance. On arrival she uncovers she has inherited a mansion but is yet to uncover the terrors that lurk in the basement below it....So in theory, this film is a direct sequel to the first movie, disregarding the originals sequels and taking a big, huge risk. It failed miserably, but kudos for the makers of the movie for trying to do something a little different.again with these sort of movies, the main problem is the character development. There is none here, and the gang of kids are the usual unlikeable lot that you don't mind being killed.The main girl is a little more human, but she turns out weird at the end anyway. Gore is really fake and in your face, and Clint Eastwoods son turns up a second time in my movie viewing month, not doing much other than trying to look like his dad back in the day.If you are looking for something that could restore your faith in the horror genre, especially the remake side, you won't find it here.If you want a silly movie you can have on in the back ground, where you can laugh at scenes where the 3D should be, and not worry about plot development, but have a pretty twisted ending, you could do a lot worse.but only just...",Texas Chainsaw
17,trashgang,turkey massacre,3,7 May 2013,"This could have been the next big thing together with Evil Dead. But sadly it wasn't due a few reasons. Being teased with the fact that Gunnar Hansen and Marilyn Burns were in it was a let down. Gunnar is almost unrecognizable and Marilyn appears only at the end. But not only that, the effects done by Nicotero was a let down too. I thought that we would see some gore like in The Walking Dead series, sadly it doesn't. It only offers a few CGI effects and even that was laughable and badly done, just see the meat grinder.The movie rather started okay with new shots combined with the original movie and it worked out fine. When Sally escapes at the end of the original that's the moment were this one picks in. A revenge party is set to destroy the Sawyer family for good. We do see the rescue of a baby. Move further a few years and we start to know Heather (Alexandra Daddario) who gets a letter that she is getting a house in Texas by her granny. By doing so she also knows that her parents aren't her real ones, guess who she family from?Of she goes to the house in Texas with a few friends. From their on this flick becomes ridiculous and laughable. The two girls cast, Alexandra Daddario and Tania Raymonde (Nikki) were only cast for their titability. But even that fails, when Nikki strips before a friend nothing is shown. Heather goes a bit further but even then nothing is shown.The script from the moment in Texas doesn't make sense. When Heather discovers a body nothing is done with that fact. Leatherface never looked scary and even got emotions when Heather reveals to him who she is. On part of the 3D it was a failure too. No 3D throughout the film just a few chainsaw 3D shots. The 3D is done with the credits. It doesn't deliver nothing new to the story of the Sawyers. It failed in so many ways that I really didn't like it at all.

I believe the movie will not get an academy award. What worked in the movie: The 3 D effects were actually good. The Chainsaw comes right at you! Other films with 3 D effects were fuzzy and Chainsaw was able to clean up the 3 D effects. My friend and I got a headache after the movie. Chainsaw 3 D blends the old 1974 Chainsaw massacre with C G I into the current movie and story. The old and new has a great segue. 3 D Chainsaw storyline shows how family feuds start with family backing family. The family theme creates a potential for a part two. What does not work for Chainsaw 3 D is a run of the mill script with the same plot devices, gore etc and ending which makes the film predictable.

19,deloudelouvain,Sequels are rarely better,5,12 July 2017,"Being a fan of the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre I gave this one a shot even though I know that sequels are rarely better then their predecessors. And this one is not an exception to the rule. I don't expect much of the acting when it's a gory slasher movie, neither do I about the story because the stories of those kind of movies are just always the same. But nonetheless I expected a bit more about the story. This one is just average. I never had that creepy feeling like in the first movie but then again I was way younger at that time. I wonder if I would still like the first one after all those years. Maybe I should check it out. But this one just didn't do the job. But to say it's the worst movie ever like some say on here isn't true. It's just not the best slasher movie, that's it.",Texas Chainsaw
20,StevePulaski,A blatantly disrespectful addition,1,6 January 2013,"NOTE: Contains spoilers of the original 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Not spoilers of Texas Chainsaw 3D are given.I guess it has become a standard that I begin the new year by seeing a depressingly bad horror film. Last year, I was subjected to the lowest common denominator of entertainment by watching The Devil Inside. This year, I'm forced to slog through another bland, uninteresting, gory, suspense-less continuation of a classic horror film. Texas Chainsaw 3D is a hopelessly unnecessary film. A film that's first priority is to rob you of hard-earned cash by implementing a surcharge for its lame, underused 3D gimmick, and second is to give you what you already came for just in very, very modest amounts.I'll debrief the history of Tobe Hooper's franchise for you. I doubt he expected it to go off like this. He first introduced the killer Leatherface in the original 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was met with rave reviews, several bans in different countries, and birthed the slasher genre along with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. He followed it up with two sequels and a film bearing a subtitle called ""The Next Generation,"" which jump started the careers of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey. We then received a remake in 2003, a prequel to the remake in 2006, further confusing fans and devoted cultists, from the company Platinum Dunes, and now we receive this mess that tries to follow up to Hooper's original but almost seems to intentionally bastardize itself from it. It is littered with unexplained inconsistencies, abrupt characters, and seems that it was written by people who only read the vaguest of ""Cliff Notes"" from the original 1974 film.I'll enlighten you before I go into the inconsistencies. The story begins with a highlight reel of the murders from the original 1974 film, and then we are presented with the Sawyer home, the home of Leatherface, and the several people in it, being shot and burned to nothing by a group of enraged southerners. The only one who winds up living is Leatherface, only no one figures that out right away. A man discovers one of the Sawyer women has a young baby and is desperately hanging on to her life, and winds up killing her to keep the baby safe. He takes it home with his wife and raises her into a healthy girl named Heather.Now Heather (Alexandra Daddario) is a grown woman, who has just been informed her grandmother that she never met died in her large estate, and after learning she is a ""Sawyer,"" a name feared in these parts, her, her boyfriend Ryan (rapper ""Trey Songz""), and two other compadres Nikki (Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (Keram Malicki-Sánchez) make the commute down to the large home to claim the property and what's inside. They too pick up a seemingly kind hitchhiker named Darryl (Shaun Sipos) at a gas station. Upon arriving at the home, she realizes it bares secrets just by the way it looks. It's only a matter of time before Leatherface is encountered and the madness ensues. It unfolds like you'd expect.If you had any admiration or any fondness, more-so respect for the original 1974 film you should in no way take a liking to this film. It blatantly butchers the original film's ending by adding and subtracting elements that leave it in incoherent shambles. In the original film, there were about four people (five including Leatherface, if I remember correctly) that served as the sociopath murderers that resided in the Sawyer home that was seen burning down in the opening here. In this film, about ten people are residing in the Sawyer home when it picks up, so where did the overweight hillbillies or the infant child come from? Also, the original took place in 1974. The film picks up twenty-three years after the events in 1974 and Heather is obviously twenty-three years old. This would mean that Texas Chainsaw 3D exists in 1997, but everything screams modern from the present technology, the gas prices, and the music. So if this takes place in present time, 2012, that would render Heather about thirty-eight years old and she is most certainly not thirty-eight. She's young, fresh, and fragile.Texas Chainsaw 3D's biggest flaw is something I don't believe I've ever said about a film attempting to continue from its predecessor, but it's the film's lack of respect and loyalty to its original material. Yet I'm sure that many teenagers who will find a way to see this film won't mind. It would appear that a cohesive timeline is not even important to them. If they see attractive leads, some gore, and some gruesomeness, it's their new favorite film. ""There was a Texas Chainsaw Massacre before this?"" some will say.Texas Chainsaw 3D is an abysmal horror film, light on scares, suspense, respect, tension, craft, and likable characters. Things happen in the third half that are most illogical on almost every character's part. The evil bad guys are the ones that murdered the Sawyer family, and the good guys are the ones that are defending the murderous monster claiming he's misunderstood and troubled. Could we forgive mass-murderers for their same actions claiming the same point? Tell that to their families. What a bloody, unforgiving nightmare of a film.NOTE: John Luessenhop's use of the 3D is collectively mediocre at best. There's no sense of place, no use of it as a gimmick, and no reason for it. It's a lucrative process that is charging good people extra for horror films and must be stopped. I didn't give any money to RealD 3D last year, and I saw over one-hundred films. I hate to start 2013 off on a bad foot.",Texas Chainsaw
21,blanbrn,Well done and exciting horror reboot blended as a vintage continuation.,8,4 January 2013,"Being a horror fan I love the classic 1974 Texas Chainsaw film with the original Leatherface(Gunnar Hansen)and to start with this modern reboot continuation a montage of vintage clips are shown to bring back memories.

Heather Miller(Alexandra Daddario)finds that she has inherited property an old Texas rural mansion near the slaughters of decades ago. So she packs up out of state with her friends two males and her other friend is a hot and free spirited gal named Nikki(the hot and sexy Tania Raymonde)to go to Texas to the home yet a prize is in store with the inheritance you guessed good old Leatherface himself. Only this horror film with take a little bit of an odd twist and ending, still along the way it's full of plenty of blood, guts, and screams and drama chase scenes. Plus to add some sugar and spice the scenes of the hot and sexy Nikki(Tania Raymonde)wearing that sexy pink/reddish looking bra blends well with a horror film. Overall well done horror film that has a story connected to a past and it's blended with blood, screams, and eye candy sex appeal to make it a watch.",Texas Chainsaw
22,Hellmant,"This is a series that's given us very memorable acting turns from the likes of Dennis Hopper, Viggo Mortensen, Matthew McConaughey and R. Lee Ermey but nothing like that here!",6,8 January 2013,"'Texas CHAINSAW 3D': Three Stars (Out of Five) The seventh film in the long running slasher series picks up right after the original 1974 classic left off and kind of ignores the events of the other films. It's directed by John Luessenhop (who also directed the 2010 crime film 'TAKERS') and presented in 3D. It was written by Adam Marcus, Debra Sullivan, Kristen Elms and Stephen Susco and tells the story of Leatherface's cousin, who meets her maniac relative when she inherits the home he's staying in. Sadly the film is one of the weakest of the series but if you're a fan of the franchise you'll most likely still get a kick out of it.The film begins right at the end of the original with a montage of scenes from that film opening the movie. It then continues the story with Leatherface (now played by Dan Yeager) and his family of cannibal killers (the Sawyer clan) being attacked in their home by an angry mob of local townsfolk. Bill Moseley (who played another Sawyer in 1986's 'THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2') takes over the role of Drayton Sawyer (the head of the family from the original film) and Gunnar Hanson (the original Leatherface) makes an appearance as Boss Sawyer. The family of killers is believed to be all killed as their house burns to the ground. A young baby is removed from the scene alive though and raised in secrecy by a couple unable to have a child of their own. Years later as an adult, named Heather (Alexandra Daddario), she learns of her true identity when she inherits a Texas estate from her grandmother. She takes her boyfriend (Trey Songz) and two friends (Tania Raymonde and Keram Malicki-Sanchez) with her on a road trip as she travels to Texas to check out her inheritance. Once there Heather and her friends also discover Leatherface alive and well and living in the basement of Heather's new home. His initial reaction to his new visitors isn't a friendly one to say the least.The movie is almost so bad it's good but that might be giving it just a little too much credit. If you like the Leatherface film series you'll probably enjoy seeing him slaughter his way through a new group of kids and the gore is completely over the top and very gruesome. You might also get a kick out of the 3D death scenes (and 3D chainsaw coming at you), if you see it that way. Ultimately the film is just disappointing. It starts off with a good setup but then just falls in to the same routine gimmicks the series always does with absolutely nothing new or original to offer (and the cheese factor is really bad this time). This is a series that's given us very memorable acting turns from the likes of Dennis Hopper, Viggo Mortensen, Matthew McConaughey and R. Lee Ermey and this film doesn't have any actors chewing up the scenery like that (it does have Clint Eastwood's son Scott doing nothing memorable as a cop though). The one dependable thing it does deliver is Leatherface and to me he's always entertaining. Definitely a weak link in the series but it's still worthwhile.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fP2Kjuc4BQY",Texas Chainsaw
23,thesar-2,Sympathy for the Devils,1,6 January 2013,"After the 2-minute excellent opening recapping the 1974 classic original, Texas Chainsaw immediately began its long list of many plot holes, problems, inconsistencies and struggles within its own story.Sad. After a fantastic remake, a very entertaining and brutal prequel, we fall back to the terrible threes: Texas Chainsaw Massacres chapters 2-4. Oh, well, Halloween also did that following the great Halloween: H20 with the Busta Rhymed-out Resurrection.It's also sad that I didn't take adequate notes during this to warn the public about the multiples of problems, namely with the timeline and the laugh-out-loud replenished family of new members when the movie attempted to show what happened following the 1974 attack.Did the writers (or the sleeping director) even try? Hell, I'd even give it to them if the movie was brutal like, say EVERY SINGLE ONE of the previous installments. That would've been a great excuse: ""Well, we know we had script problems from the beginning, but look at all this imaginative gore!"" Nope, that would be a lie for a movie that should've been barely PG-13 by today's standards.OK, so the plot revolves around an early 20s – that really should be in her late 30s – girl, who was raised (surprisingly) wonderfully by bad, backwards parents and she abruptly finds out she's adopted. So, off to Texas she goes with thee most bland group of friends – so blah, that they're not even the fun kinds from the Friday the 13th series where you cannot wait until they're picked off. There, in another hilariously bad plot hole, (try not to laugh when a police officer drops off an confidential box labeled as ""Evidence"" in front of a victim and then leaves the room) she learns she's had a better life with her adopted, backwoods parents than she would've in Texas.Someone told me about a carnival scene in which the film's killer kousin, Leatherface, runs amok. I thought, well, that's original, for this series, at least. When that scene came up, I thought: ""Fantastic, the climax, finally."" Um. No. Just as badly the scene was constructed and lazily thought out, we still had roughly 40 more miserable minutes left.It's not entirely obvious that this is a leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. Nowadays, remakes, reboots, resomethings, can be bad, but sometimes, shockingly decent. So, there's always that chance they're going to do it right. I wish I could've just left my brain at the theatre's entrance, but there was absolutely nothing to hold onto. No inventive kills, no character not cut out of moldy cardboard, no one to root for, no meaningful or comprehensive plot and no real scares – aside from one tiny jump from me, but even that was seen coming from ten minutes earlier. Hell, they even put in the obligatory homophobic remark that might have fit the ""townsfolk"" lingo, but still puts hateful thoughts into viewer's minds.This mess of a movie is not necessarily dampening my view of 2013, but it certainly didn't make my New Year's intro film a positive one. Skip it!",Texas Chainsaw

25,Robert_duder,Welcome back original slasher genre,8,17 January 2013,"In my late teens I fell in love with the old school 70's and 80's slasher genre. Cheesy, campy, gory, bloody, spooky...whatever. Halloween, Friday the 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street and of course Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Unfortunately, the 2000's brought a host of those same slasher remakes meaning fans of the original would never see another sequel to those original films. Well God bless the makers of Texas Chainsaw 3D. This is a direct sequel to the very first original legendary Texas Chainsaw film. It does mostly ignore all the other films including the remakes in the 2000's though I think they try to draw on some of the lore established in other sequels and remakes. The film features four actors from the original film in new roles. The story is solid but does jump into some seriously cheesy area towards the end but it doesn't wreck anything. The film is off the charts gory and twisted like any previous Texas Chainsaw film. It still keeps that dark country feel that you would expect from the series. I saw the film in 3D and anyone who reads my reviews knows I am NOT a fan of 3D and this was no exception. It didn't change the film at all or make it better although there was ONE scene when the chainsaw came right at the screen and it actually looked like it was right in front of you.The cast is as stereotypical as you could possibly expect, but in a good way. This is Texas Chainsaw and there is no reason to mess with what works. The stunning dark haired beauty Alexandra Daddario is our scream queen of the film. She has a certain innocence to her but they still use her sexuality to draw the male crowd. She has killer abs that make a constant appearance throughout the film. She is good in her role and appropriately screams, runs and fights the way you would expect from any good scream queen. A man without a lot of credits to his name...Dan Yeager has the distinct honour of picking up the chainsaw as Leatherface. He is excellent, as good as any of the others and makes you almost feel an empathy for him which I think is the point of the character. He is twisted and angry but also mentally stunted and child like at times. Yeager does a great job. Trey Songz is Daddario's boyfriend and our ""token black guy."" He's decent though has very little development and you know he will be fodder for Leatherface. Same could be said for Tania Raymonde as the ""loose morals"" gal who will inevitably do a lot of screaming and running and sleeping around. She does her genre role decently. Shaun Sipos is good as the innocent seeming thief and Leatherface's first victim. Thom Barry and Paul Rae are terrific as the opposing Sheriff and Mayor, always at odds and burying a decades old secret. The two of them added an old school vibe to their scenes like old characters from the original were there although neither one of them were in the original, character or actor. Scott Eastwood is decent as the seemingly hero cop and I enjoyed where they took his character although I think they could have used him more.I have to pay credit where credit is due and I was surprised to see how little big name credits director John Luessenhop has under his belt. This also appears to be his first foray into horror and hopefully not his last because he expertly crafts a truly outstanding slasher flick and it feels inside and out like Texas Chainsaw. The film truly covers the gambit of what Leatherface is all about and all the stories that have been built around him through multiple films. The family connection is even stronger in this one and the family storyline is sort of reminiscent of the old Halloween but with a completely different twist to it. The best and worst lines of the film are both one liners in the form of ""Welcome to Texas $#*&^"" (best line) and the worst line takes an otherwise seriously gory and disturbing film and makes it briefly incredibly cheesy and that was ""Do your thing cuz""...terrible line, but great movie. Fans should love it and newcomers to the series...where have you been? Watch the original one right now and then watch this one. Loved it! 8.5/10",Texas Chainsaw
26,Edvis-1997,3,3,25 November 2018,Really nothing special. Possible to watch but is it worth? I wouldn't be so sure. Those special effects yack.. cringe.. I thought it's like 2006 movie but when I saw it's 2013 it shocked me how poor it looks.,Texas Chainsaw
27,bowmanblue,It reminds me of that old Star Wars quote...,5,10 January 2015,"""Who's the more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him?"" That's how I feel. I wonder who's more to blame - the film-makers, for making this awful movie, or me for being stupid enough to expect it to be okay.Now, anyone who chooses to watch a film with words like 'chainsaw' and 'massacre' is its title should, hopefully, know what they're getting. We know it's never going to be high-art with deep, high-brow, Oscar-worthy performances. However, what we do hope is that it will at least be an entertaining entry into the 'slasher' genre. The Texas Chainsaw 3D isn't.First of all, actually quite liked Michael Bay's 2003 remake and even found something strangely enjoyable about the prequel 'The Beginning' so my hopes were reasonably high for this. It's worth noting that it totally disregards both recent outings and goes straight back to the beginning, i.e. it's a direct sequel to the 1973 original. We see the aftermath of the first film, where angry locals destroy the cannibals' house, all but a young girl, who's saved. Now, this is where it gets confusing... the story picks up 20-odd years later when the girl is (clearly) in her early twenties, which, by my calculations, sets the film in about 1995. Yet the exact year (and we know this by the gravestones) is 2012, complete with iphones etc to prove it. Anyway, glossing over that plot inconsistency, we're treated to more of the same... only worse.Considering this is based on the movie that some might argue 'spawned' the entire slasher genre, it plays into every single cliché going. Seriously... in this day and age, where the premise of a couple having sex then dying horribly has been so widely lampooned, i.e. Scream and Cabin in the Woods, why are film-makers still using it? Again, the clichés could be forgiven if you cared for the characters. You won't. But there could be some decent gore for us to enjoy? There isn't. The 'gore' looks totally fake and completely CGI (you'll find better special effects on a made-for-TV movie). What about the story, does it add anything to the genre? Yes and No. It tries. However, everything 'new' it comes up with is completely unbelievable and stupid. I won't spoil it for you as there are some things you may not expect to find in a movie like this. Sadly, they're all too far-fetched to be believable.What could have been a decent attempt to make a sequel to a classic has fallen well short, due to bad special effects, no likeably characters and a completely idiotic story.As they say in Scream 4 ""Never mess with the original.""",Texas Chainsaw

I have never seen any Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie. I know they have a ton but I haven't had any desire to see any. After watching this I can see why. I also have to admit that I am pretty much over movies that are made just to show gore and people getting cut up.

30,callanvass,Ambitious and admittedly fairly entertaining,5,12 December 2013,"This takes place right after the massacre in 1974 from the original. The Sawyer's are hunted down by a mob mentality of rednecks, and subsequently killed as a result when they burn the Sawyer house to the ground. Nobody knows Leatherface has survived. A woman named Heather learns that she has inherited an estate in Texas from her deceased Grandmother. On her way, she uncovers corruption and murderI enjoyed the reboots to a certain extent, but when this was announced I groaned out loud. I just felt they should put this series to rest, but here we are, and it's actually better than you might think. One thing I'll give this movie credit for is the balls to do things its own way. This is a sequel to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and that's heading into very dangerous territory. It even ignores Tobe Hoper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre II. It has an arrogant ""Screw you. This is the sequel to the original"" attitude, but in all honesty I dug the bold attitude. You can either pull it off, or you end up infuriating die hard fans of the original, and tarnishing the impact. Thankfully, I can honestly say this does not tarnish the original, and this film does deserve merit. I liked how they showed clips from the original in the opening, before continuing directly from the ending of the original. It has some decent boo scares, OK suspense, and it passes the time rather enjoyably. This movie does feel rushed, despite its ambitions. I didn't think they explored the darker side enough of our lead heroine Heather (Alexandra Daddario) Maybe they are going to do that more in the sequel, it sure looks like it, but it just felt a bit sloppy with the execution. I didn't give a damn about any of the characters either. They were written so thinly that it's hard to care about any of them. Alexandra Daddario is fine as the lead, but I didn't really care about her fate. She just felt there, and I wasn't really into her. The horrible dialog she had didn't help matters. The line ""Do your thing, cuz!"" made me cringe. She's hotter than donut grease, I'll say that. Leatherface didn't feel nearly as threatening as past entries. He feels like a wimp in this movie, similar to Texas Chainsaw Massacre II (1986) they tried to make him sympathetic in my opinion at the end, and it was a silly thing to do. I preferred Leatherface as a reckless maniac. Tania Raymonde is the token slut, but her selfishness is poured on thick. This woman wants to have sex so bad, that she is willing to screw her best friend's (Daddario) boyfriend. Marilyn Burns & Gunnar Hansen have cameos. The gore certainly delivers. We get gunshot wounds, Leatherface using human faces, chopped off fingers, people are hanged on hooks, somebody is cut in half with a chainsaw, limbs are lying around all over the place, a pitchfork impaling, fun with a meat grinder, and more. The gore doesn't hold back. Final Thoughts: I actually enjoyed this for what it was. I admired the ballsy attitude, the gore, and the overall entertainment. What I didn't like was how thinly it was written. This had potential to be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre film people had been waiting for since the original. It's far from accomplishing that, but It does the pass the time fairly well. Horror fans should be fairly entertained, while die hard TCM fans will probably be in the middle. I dug it, and now I've forgotten it. That's a shame. It could have been much more. I'm anxious to see if they do a direct followup or do ANOTHER reboot5.6/10",Texas Chainsaw
31,ironhorse_iv,"I wish I can saw this movie in half. Keep the first half, tossed the second half, away and rewrite it. It's really that bad.",4,30 May 2014,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise is a series of horror films which depict people meeting their ends at the hands of an Ax-Crazy family in Texas known as the Sawyers. The most famous of the Sawyers is the chainsaw-toting manic known as Leatherface whom now played by actor Dan Yeager. Unlike the other Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, that were often reboots or retellings. 2013's Texas Chainsaw 3D was supposed to be a direct sequel to the 1974 classic film: Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie erase or ignored the canon of 1986 sequel Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 & 1990s Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III from existence. The film begins with stock footage recap of the 1974 film, and the events that happen after it, with the victim escaping the family's home. A lynch mob was gather up for revenge, and the Sawyer's family were killed off by them. The movie really expand the number of family numbers to a large amount. Honestly, where were half of these characters in the first movie!? For the most part, the family members that were added, are just there to get killed off, or pay homage to the first movie by having the actors in the 1974 film, to return. A good example are Gunnar Hansen as Boss Sawyer: Hansen last portrayed Leatherface in the 1974 original film and John Dugan reprise as Grandpa Sawyer. They even got Marilyn Burns, the original final girl to play a role in the film. One of new Sawyers members was an infant girl, who was spare and rescued by one of the townspeople. The infant grew up to become Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario), a 20 year old woman who decades later, learns that she inherited a mansion from her biological grandmother. With her friends, she go there and they learn the hard way that Leatherface is still alive. First off, how is Heather in her 20s?? The movie doesn't know what time period, they want to place her in. Her and her friends look like they were dressed in late 1970s/1980s, but it's clearly pointed out that 2012 with the camera phones and tombstones explicitly saying the date. Leatherface would be in his 60s. Gees he is able to run around in his age. Wouldn't Heather be like 48 year old, not in her 20s??? If the movie was place in the late 1990s where Heather would be in 20s, it would make more sense. I really don't see, the reason, why the movie had to set in the present day. The movie tries to hide this mistake, by conveniently trying to hide the year obscured and everyone seems to be going out of their way to not mention what year ""August 19th"" was. The movie has no sense of time. I have a hard time believing that Leatherface had time to un-earthed a rotten body in 10 minutes flat, just for a jump scare. The first half of the movie is just the same tiresome clichés structure of any horror movie, with a bunch of unlikeable teenagers partying too much, and having sex when they should be wondering why characters were getting whack off, one by one. The second half of the movie, has the balls to turn Leatherface into the anti-hero, when Heather learn about the truth of her past, and the townspeople decide to take their vendetta on her. Yes, the movie wants us to root for the cannibals! Heather was the most decent character in the film, but the movie had the need for her to team up with Leatherface against the evil town-folks. Wow, that's BS! Let's forget, that Leatherface killed most of her friends and try to kill her in the first half. This isn't a spoiler, since the audience knew fully aware that Heather is related to Leatherface, but why is she teaming up with him. Honestly, it would had made better, if she was given a Laurie Strode like role in 1981 Halloween 2, having to fight both the town folks and the chainsaw manic. The movie was made in 3-D, but it was rarely used. When it was use, it was just awkward or gimmicky. The movie is full of bad one-liners. The movie has a number of gorn like scenes that horror people might love, but it's badly done. Check out the awful CGI blood scenes to get why it's bad. The movie got first a NC-17 rating due to excessive gore, but after cutting it down. It was resubmit to the MPAA, and got an R rating. The movie was produced by Twisted Pictures & Lion Gates distributing. Both companies are known for their Saws movie series. There is a cameo of a chainsaw-wielding man dressed as Jigsaw in the film to hint about that. There is also a post-credits scene, that doesn't add anything to the plot. Watch it, if you want to. Overall: I get that the movie was made with heart with director John Luessenhop onboard. The obvious goal of the film was to attract genre enthusiasts who value faithfulness to the classics. It kept most of the homages, but it ruins it by the antihero concept. I do like the reappearance sound of the flash the camera makes, but for the most part, the movie is a laughable attempt to follow the original. The 2003's Texas Chainsaw Massacre is far superior to this film. It's still better than a lot of the other remakes and sequels out there.",Texas Chainsaw
32,Platypuschow,Texas Chainsaw 3D: An improvement on everything that came before,6,14 November 2017,"Now having watched all but the most recent venture for Leatherface I can confidently say that I'm not sold on the franchise. How its become a household name I cannot figure out, I only assume its riding off the first movies controversy.Almost 40yrs after that first movie was released TCM went 3D and delivered what I believe it be the best movie in the franchise.Starring Alexandra Daddario, Tania Raymonde and Scott Eastwood we see a girl return home for her inheritance only to discover her origins are rooted in blood.Though the movie doesn't bring anything new to the table it is well enough made and strengthened by a mostly decent cast.Alas however this is not a sequel and yet another much not needed reboot so expect more origins and less continuation of the Sawyer legacy.Expectedly gory, mostly well acted and interesting enough to keep my attention this has shown that the TCM franchise has potential but just fails to capitalise.The Good: Decent cast The Bad: It's still a reboot Something about this Leatherface felt off Things I Learnt From This Movie: Tania Raymonde's character will have got a lot of tips at the store Raymonde & Daddario together in a film was too much distraction for my simple mind to handle Tania Raymonde's character contains enough blood to fill the grand canyon and doesn't require it to operate Rule 1 of a TCM movie, don't trust anyone Scott Eastwood is just terrible, I mean seriously the guy never improves Daddario would make a great villain",Texas Chainsaw
33,jacobjohntaylor1,A very disappointing sequel,4,23 August 2015,This the fifth part to the original series of The Texas chainsaw massacre. This is one of the sequels were the only one that counts is the first one. The Texas chainsaw massacre 2 is the best one. The second best one is Leather face Texas chainsaw massacre 3. This one is awful. The original The Texas chainsaw massacre from 1974 is a great movie. The fourth The Texas chainsaw massacre movie. Texas chainsaw the next generation is a great movie. And this one is just awful. The Texas chainsaw massacre remake from 2003 is a better movie. And that was awful. I do want to heat about how this movie is better then Texas chainsaw massacre the next generation. That is a great movie and very underrated. Do not see this movie. The writing is awful. It very very stupid. This is one of the most stupid horror movies ever. It not scary at all. Half thou the movie the people trying to kill Leather Face become the bad guys. And Leather Face becomes the hero. And it does not seem to matter that near the beginning he kill innocent people. Good actor wasted there talent being to this awful movie movie.,Texas Chainsaw

35,TheMovieDiorama,Texas Chainsaw is as rusty as Leatherface's chasing methods.,2,22 April 2018,"Texas Chainsaw 2. Texas Chainsaw 3D. Texas Chainsaw ""I Don't Give A Flip What It's Called"". So the quote on the bluray cover states ""as terrifying as the original"", which acts as a disservice to the 1974 horror classic. Why? Because. This. Was. Atrocious. Undoing all the other sequels/remakes/reboots that the franchise consists of, this is a straight-up sequel where the Sawyer family are murdered. However, a baby girl survives and 40 years later goes back to the town to reclaim her inheritance which also includes Leatherface living in the basement still. It starts off with clips from the original, acting as a nostalgic recap for all those who have waited for a sequel. Ironically, this two minute segment is actually the only scary and realistic part of this entire flick. Aside from Daddario's enigmatic stomach which deserves its own casting credit for having the most screen time, there is nothing else here that justifies this sequel's existence. Firstly, if it is set 40 years later (there are smartphones being used), why is the main character in her early 20's? How is Leatherface's chainsaw not rusty from lack of use? Why wasn't the letter opened immediately? How is it that the police officers are overruled by the town's mayor? Why would you leave the stranger behind in the house by himself? Why was this made? Why am I watching this? Who am I? I don't even know anymore! The acting was dreadful from everyone. The provocative push for 3D gimmicky effects took away from any scares or gory moments that the film attempted to portray. A guy gets sliced by a meat grinder, it is undoubtedly one of the worst use of visual effects I've ever seen. The worst crime is that they turned Leatherface into an anti-hero. Are you actually kidding me? He just killed all of your friends darling and now you side with him just because he's family? I'm done. It's nearly a carbon copy of the original, but worse than worse. There's no logic and no reasoning for this to exist. Pass me the chainsaw, I'm cutting this disc in half.",Texas Chainsaw
36,insomniac_rod,"Entertaining somewhat nostalgic tribute to the original. BEWARE: It's not a good movie. However, it's not terrible.",6,4 January 2013,"I went to an advance screening in London and I can tell my fellow TCM die hard fans to lower expectations and give this reboot-sequel a chance.Adam Marcus, the most hated guy in the Friday the 13th franchise, co- wrote the script for TC3D and I was very worried about it. Fortunately for us, he did learn a lesson and this time he decided to pay tribute to the original 1974 story. So in the first 10 minutes we get nostalgia material such as glorious cameos (Bill Moseley playing Drayton!, Gunnar Hansen playing Leatherface, and Marilyn Burns), and a brief explanation of the events that followed Sally's escape. THE POSITIVE ASPECTS It is very straightforward. Does not takes too much time to show violence and gore. Leatherface has a decent amount of on-screen time.Watching ""new"" footage about the 1974 classic almost brought tears to my eyes. Gunnar Hansen mastered the role again even for only 10 seconds while Bill Moseley gave his own style to Drayton. The gore is very good. Nice soundtrack. Alexandra Daddario is a MAJOR HOTTIE. The fact that she shows her tiny- perfect waist all the time was the best idea ever. Plus she's a decent actress. I didn't know she was that busty. A new Scream Queen on the way?The 3D highlights of the 1974 original were fantastic. A very well deserved homage. Plus some death sequences and more were also paying tribute to Tobe Hooper's work. THE BAD ASPECTS Clichèd characters. It's very obvious that the sleazy slut friend and Heather's boyfriend have this ""romance"" only to justify their cruel deaths by the hands of Leatherface so audiences will not feel bad for them. Yeah, it doesn't works. I didn't care anyway for them. I just wanted to see their guts fly all over the theater. The plot is very basic and linear that you can predict what will happen at the end. More character background wouldn't harm. Trey Songz should return to do ...whatever he does and not act anymore in a horror movie. No nudity. Hot girls tease us with their spectacular breasts but that's it. It follows the slasher routine way too early. THE HORROR! What is wrong with the timeline?! Are we supposed to believe Heather is 40 years old? Or is it that the events of the original happened only 20 years ago? This is a terrible situation that NEEDS an explanation.OVERALL Watch is as an homage to the original and you will have a good time. OK, it does try to explain the events after Sally's escape which is brave. It becomes ambitious when trying to make the audience feel sorry for Leatherface.It's definitely better than the 2003 and 2006 Michael Bay efforts but doesn't manage to capture the charisma of the original, the craziness of the Dennis Hopper sequel. And I am not even going to talk about part III, 4, remake, and prequel. What I am trying to say is that it does try too much but doesn't gets anywhere. Therefore, I only consider it as a homage to the 1974 classic.",Texas Chainsaw
37,videorama-759-859391,"A movie, it's only value worth it's weight in overindulgent gore",4,9 January 2014,"We are now in the present phase of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It's hard to believe the last gory offering, probably the goriest if I faithfully recall, was the prelude to this nightmarish franchise of carnage. What we got going here, so much is merely an excuse for another one. The story ends much like the end of Halloween, the remake. When an angry group of out of towners kill and torch Leatherface's house, save for a infant of this insane family, one of the angry mob saves, they overlook the maniacal Jed surviving. Cut twenty or so years later, that puts us in the late eighties/early nineties, which way you want to cut it, Jed/Leatherface's Aunt, dies, leaving a big inheritance, the lovely revamped estate, where all the raze and ruin once happened. So now grown up, looking hot, this poor twentie's girl, who's just found out she's f..kin' adopted, heads down to Texas, with her hotter girlfriend and their men to pick up the spondouli, but make the dreaded mistake, not just picking up a stray, but also staying the night, as not really being unaccustomed to such lavish surrounds. And guess who's in the house. I like the path the story took from here, and with movies like this nowadays, the women have to be super hot, with big boobs (just check out the last 'Chainsaw movie') and the men have to be studs. There's quite a great deal of suspense here and there, and that chainsaw really gets bloody again, severing waists from torsos, what have you. The modernized feel to it, in it's start, after the prior flashback torching of the house, where Leatherface had got some town people mad, and his family were gonna hand him over, had me worried, as it just seemed unfitting, it's saviour, film's songs with bold lyrics, of course involving chainsaws, the earlier song, cuter and cheekier. But then it took off after the drifter, stepped into the picture, but the film truly becomes engrossing, once Leatherface lets his saw rip, and before as I said, from here, we take an interesting path of story. One predictability for me, was the young cop character (Clint's son), who smelt off right for the beginning, and when the young philly came jumping in the car, near the end, the predictability was patent as a shiner. And for the cheap over the top gore, which I loved, horror fans of this franchise, should be humbly contented, like you'll be humbly awaiting, the cops fitting demises, as you really wanna see inheritance girl, kick arse. Now I'll be honest, with these films, that have become some formula, and I'm talking remakes mostly, we have been down this road many times before, where the only high we'll to get out of this, is the disgusting gore, the gore factor, this movie is a perfect example. A film of cheap gore, but nothing of real value. But we do have a nice ending that I liked. May'be Leatherface will find some real love in his life, now.",Texas Chainsaw

The first remake of ""Texas Chainsaw"" at least had a bold approach and a really nasty feeling to it. This one, the dreaded ""3D"" version - yes, avoid any movie with ""3D"" in the title - is so confusing, I still don't really understand it.I was confused about who the villains were and what they wanted with the heroine. There seemed to be too many characters.The movie also tries sudden notes on the soundtrack to underline scary events, but I swear, sometimes the notes come on before the action does, thus signposting what was supposed to be a surprise. How did they mess that up?The ""gore"" is also pretty lame. The only bit that got my attention was a scene involving a meat grinder.The movie features Tania Raymonde, known to millennials as Malcolm's love interest in ""Malcolm in the Middle"", and Trey Songz, whom R'nB fans will recognize immediately, though they may not have even known he had a film career.",Texas Chainsaw

Whilst Texas Chainsaw is by no means a masterpiece, it does at least try to form some kind of narrative around the killings and also tries to develop Leatherface a little more as a character. I also liked the way that this film did make a link back to the original and the story itself (whilst not being mind-blowing brilliant) it did enough to hold my interest when old Leatherface was not on his murderous rampage.Unfortunately, Texas Chainsaw does still suffer some of the same problems that plagued the original such as a number of disposable/unlikeable characters and quite a lot of poor acting. On the plus side once the first 30 minutes are out of the way it does make for a fairly fast-paced last 60 minutes so for me the film remained 'watchable' without drifting in to the category of 'dull' and/or 'boring'.I'm not going to lie and say that this is a 'brilliant' film with an amazing story because it isn't. However, what you get here is 90 minutes of switch off your brain mediocrity; in other words it's watchable without being particularly memorable.

Then at some point later, the town's sheriff goes to the house of the crazy family to have them turn over Leatherface. They entertain the idea until the town folk show up to take revenge on the family. They shoot the whole place up and burn it down. All are thought dead except a young mom and her newborn.In our time time we meet the gorgeous Heather who is a butcher at a supermarket (right, I bet they all look like that). She's in an interracial relationship with some guy who is so desirable that even her best friend can't keep her hands from him. Heather gets a letter from a lawyer that she inherited some property. The gang decide to make a roadtrip of it with some other friend. On the way they pick up a hitchhiker they almost ran over. They end up at the property- a veritable mansion. While the kids go to the town, the hitchhiker stays back and robs the place and while looking around discovers a cellar, a metal door, and Leatherface.The kids make it back home and Leatherface is unleashed. Heather goes to the cops and discovers the town's past, and her past. She is the little girl who survived the lynching. The town's current mayor was the main guy behind the killing of her entire family. He's now after her and Leatherface. All this leads to a showdown at the slaughterhouse.As a horror movie, Texas Chainsaw 3D is pretty weak. There are just two or three gory scenes. The body count is ridiculously low. No cannibalism is involved. Instead we get hints of Leatherface's transvestism- who wants to see that? This movie makes little good use of 3D, there are only 3 interesting scenes. There is no nudity. What this movie has though is the gorgeous and hot Alexandra Daddario. And fortunately the costume people gave her some very appropriate wardrobe. I did like the turn the story took and the possibility that it opens for the future. It stays away from the straightforward and tired good guys vs. bad guys model and gives us a bit of a surprise.The reason this movie fails as a horror movie is because the clowns behind this movie were much more interested in making some tired politics of identity statement that would almost be funny if it weren't so cheap and pathetic. You have the obligatory (these days) female heroine. She's white, her boyfriend is black. For some reason, the white female/ black male the only interracial relationship Hollywood is interested in portraying. There some is homosexual white guy who cooks. The petty thief is also a white guy. Not to mention all the white male country hicks. If it weren't for the weak but good-natured black sheriff (!) the town would be nothing but crazies. Of course it's easier to present this bizarre picture of America than actually putting your money where your mouth is. I bet the boards of Hollywood corporations look nothing like this Matrixian Sion they are trying to present. Instead of trying to remake America in their perverse image, Hollywood should focus on learning how to make good movies.",Texas Chainsaw

Okay I just need to get something off my chest, I pretty much hate all the other films in this franchise. Most of them are gruelling slow, if not just plain stupid and badly acted. But this one, oddly enough, I feel has the most charm out of all of them. The acting isn't half bad this time around, and the storyline is interesting to follow. I was entertained all the way throughout- and even despite some stupid character decisions on screen and some other pointlessness- I found myself having an oddly good time. The film is the right kind of tense and just gorey enough to be fun without it being tedious. I'm not a huge fan of the mask for Leatherface in this one, but I am glad they humanized him more this time around and finally gave his character a much deserved depth.

Film cleverly changes hitchhiker from potential killer (as was the case in the earlier film) to the real killer's first victim. Also has most of the main characters killed off in the first 30 minutes instead of slowing torturing them throughout more of the film; the girl does actually get to the police for help, in another unexpected twist. The first two kills are both good shocks, but the remaining kills are fairly lame.The film is all the more better for these scenes, but it also expects us to believe ludicrous claim that the heroine and killer are cousins, and both protect each other during ridiculous deus ex machina climax. Alexandra Daddario is gorgeous (Chainsaw? What chainsaw? I was too busy staring at her big blue eyes to notice any giant with a chainsaw. I watched the film a second time just to stare at her eyes in 3D again) but her scenes are not sexual enough to excite anyone except 12 year old boys, which was disappointing. 3D filming was mostly just a needless gimmick, I didn't even notice it in many scenes. The obligatory Scene-After-End-Credits is lame, it was seemingly added just so the filmmakers could say ""Look! We put a scene after the closing credits!"" Ditto the needless cameos of actors from the original film. Filmed primarily in July and August 2011, but unreleased until January 2013. The studio probably just simply forgot about it during that time.",Texas Chainsaw
51,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Texas Chainsaw 3D""- Absolutely insulting...",1,30 October 2017,"You know... there's varying levels of the concept of 'bad.' There's just plain-old bad. There's enjoyably bad. There's unintentionally bad. All sorts of different ways that simple, three-letter word can be used to give meaning to something. But then there's a film like ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"", a 2013 semi-sequel that seeks to continue the story right where the original Tobe Hooper masterpiece left off. It had potential. It really did. It boasted a high-concept story. It sought to connect itself to the iconic first film. It held the promise of top-notch modern day effects. It had so much going for it. And how did it end up? It ended up a very special type of that delightful term 'bad.' The type of 'bad' that's almost indescribable. Unforgivable, even. And most certainly unforgettable. ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" emerges as not only indisputably the worst film of the franchise... but also indisputably one of the worst mainstream horror movies of all time. Yes. It is indeed THAT type of 'bad.'Days after the events of the original massacre, the dreaded Sawyer family is all but completely wiped out in an act of vigilante justice, with seemingly the only survivor being a now-orphaned infant. Adopted by the same men who killed her family, decades later in the present day, the child- now named Heather (Alexandra Daddario)- has grown up and learns that she was adopted. What makes it all the more confusing is that despite the fact she should be in her 40's by this point, she's very clearly in her early 20's and acts as such. Which is just one of literally dozens of glaring plot-holes. But I digress... Heading out to Texas with a group of friends upon learning of her biological grandmother's supposed death, Heather is eventually confronted by her deadly past and encounters her relative 'Leatherface'- who begins to pick them off one-by-one. However, a series of troubling events will make Heather question her allegiances and motivations, as she is pulled between her current life and the call of her true lineage...Oh, boy...To get it out of the way, it's almost impossible to view this film without picking up on the unending plethora of errors, mistakes and general displays of incompetence that pop up in virtually every single scene. From the mind-numbing timeline issue of having the modern-day protagonist being in her 20's despite having been born in the early 1970's... to laughably inept digital effects that look like they were ripped from a 1993 TV-movie... to the fact that the opening sequence actually paints the evil cannibal Sawyer clan as innocent victims of rednecks gone rogue... every since facet of ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is frankly devastatingly poorly conceived and handled. It's beyond hack-filmmaking in its execution. It's something else entirely. Something far worse. I genuinely do not know what was going through director John Luessenhop's head during production. How could he knowingly make something so fundamentally and insultingly broken without realizing it? Does he really have so little respect for his audience that he thinks we can't even do simple math?Even beyond these unforgivable mistakes, the rest of the film is a complete and utter failure. Not a single darned thing works. Visually, the film is uninspired and drab, with flat lighting and poorly framed shots that don't inspire tension or even really flow well outside of one or two early sequences. And it's made all the worse by the over-gimmicky 3D that intrudes repeatedly throughout the film at an inconsistent pace. It's like they forgot the film was supposed to be in 3D, so they jarringly added a few random effects in here and there that instantly take you out of the movie because they clash with everything else. Again... beyond hack in its execution. The script by a small army of writers is a bland mish-mash of every cliché in the book, and filled to burst with nonsensical inconsistencies and insane contrivances that aim to raise the bar on the series... but only succeed in tanking it over and over again.The cast is just ridiculous. The women are all over-sexualized and completely vapid thanks to the awful writing, and the actresses assembled seem completely inorganic in the roles. Lead Daddario in particular being woefully bad, inducing far too many uncomfortable cringes in the audience as she stumbles through the film. She's looks like an uncomfortable child in a school play. And Tania Raymonde is too far over-the-top as Heather's slinky friend Nikki, and quickly grates the nerves within seconds of appearing. Not that the men fare any better at all- mainly serving as either cheap eye-candy or blatant storytelling devices. Trey Songz falls completely flat as Heather's boyfriend in a one-note performance that shows the dangers of stunt-casting semi-popular singers in film roles. Paul Rae is unintentionally hilarious as a conniving mayor who pops up now and again. And for the love of god... can we please stop trying to make Scott Eastwood a thing?""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" is a cynical piece of trash from a cynical filmmaker who clearly does not care one bit that he's tanking horror royalty. There's no other way to say it. It's amongst the worst horror films I've ever seen and it insults the audience again and again, all while destroying the integrity of that classic original film. It's a 1 out of 10. Avoid like the freaking plague.",Texas Chainsaw
52,quincytheodore,"The movie is as lost as a young woman running scared in the wood, and we know she's gonna trip herself and ridiculously falls.",3,10 February 2015,"Texas Chainsaw 3D brings a few tricks to reinvigorate an already tired series but sadly fails to polish the fundamentals. When another title comes of from well-known franchise such as Texas Chainsaw which has inspired many movies of its genre, people already has an expectation, while this is an allure, it's also a strain to create fresh ideas. A bunch of 3D antics and choppy script are definitely not the way to pique audience's interest.The story follows Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario) as she's about to be surprised with extravagant inheritance by her unknown grandmother. This involves a visit to countryside where the famous massacre occurred, she also takes the liberty on taking her carbon copy stereotypical friends as any other nice horror leads may do. The first act goes as predictable as it comes, right down to the clumsy coincidence, common slashing and comical chase.I appreciate the movie's attempt to portray Leatherface as more than his usual villainous slasher persona. He's given more back story to make audience sympathize with him, however this doesn't result in an engaging character, either for protagonist or antagonist. The direction, coupled with jumbled script, makes it hard to take any of it seriously. At some points, the movie almost exclusively steers into comedy realm, this is not the path it wants to follow. The movie is as lost as a young woman running scared in the wood, and we know she's gonna trip herself and ridiculously falls.At the very least, the lead Alexandra Daddario tries to raise the character as her role gets more investment. It's almost good to see a stronger protagonist instead of the usual victim personality, but the way the development takes place is unnatural. Addition of 3D effect doesn't help, it gives away the gore much too obvious, and random object thrown into one's face has become the fastest tired invention on late.If it's only a brief visitation of old memory lane, or a few ironic chuckles, Texas Chainsaw 3D might be bearable. However, fans of the old might even be more disappointed of how the original has fallen.",Texas Chainsaw
53,rivertam26,An intriguing mess,6,6 January 2013,"I would like to preface this review by saying that in no way am I saying that Texas Chaiunsaw 3D is a good film in fact it is quite a horrible one but not without some surprisingly competent cinematic merit. Set up as a direct sequel to the 1974 classic the film opens with a cool recap of that iconic film before picking up moments after where it left off. The remaining family members (of which there seems to be quite a few more of) come under attack by a local band of townsfolk who take some vigilante justice into their own hands. They set the house ablaze with the Sawyer clan inside and begin firing on them. The sole survivor is baby who some odd years later (38 if we are being exact) but which doesn't really make too much sense in the films time line we meet Heather who receives a notification that her grandmother has passed and has left her with her estate in Texas. Soon after Heather, her boyfriend played by a constantly shirtless Trey Songz and her other friends set out for her estate while on their way to New Orleans. And you can kinda guess what happens there but actually not really. You see because the film which could have taken an easier route instead decides to confront more complex themes. Such as despite the violence that Leatherface commits where does his actions come from. He is a developmentally disabled and at the base is just doing whats been taught to him in an effort to protect his family. But the atrocities the townspeople commit are intentional and yes maybe what they did before in murdering the villainous family could be understood but in the pursuit to cover up a secret can there actions be excused. Several bad one liners, truly hideous performances and insipid direction are responsible for the films terrible execution. But credit should be given where it is due and it is surprising and maybe even a little brave for a film of this sorts to be ambitious enough to even try and do something different with the material. Still with the addition of annoying genre staples such as forced sex scenes,unnecessarty gore, a healthy display of female anatomy and unbelievable dumb character actions can not be excused even in the pursuits of something more quantifiable. All in all its still pretty awful and mostly comes across unintentionally funny and not very scary, but an intriguing mess it is. 2.5/5",Texas Chainsaw
54,Screen_Blitz,Another horror remake gone terribly wrong,2,2 February 2016,"In recent years, it seems like Hollywood has been running scarce on ideas for horror films and taking the easy route by remaking classic horror flicks from the 70s and 80s, and the results are often ill- fated. This remake of the 1974 classic 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' just so happens to be another remake of a horror film gone terrible wrong in nearly every conceivable way. Directed by John Luessenhop, this film follows Heather Miller (played by Alexandra Daddario) who discovers she has a long-lost grandmother she never knew, and decides to travel to an old town in Texas to collect the inheritance; bringing along her boyfriend Ryan (played by Trey Songz) and her friends Nikki (played by Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (played by Keram Malicki-Sanchez). The four friends, along with a mysterious hitchhiker named Darryl (played by Shaun Sipos) spend the night at her grandmother's old ranch. And before they know it, they are stalked by grungy, chainsaw-wielding maniac known as Leatherface (played by Dan Yueger) who happens to be related to Heather.This movie is anything but the horror remake we need. Whether it is from the lousy writing, the mediocre acting, the poorly drawn out characters, or its overall laughable direction; this film serves a textbook example of a remake that disrespects the original which was scary and brilliantly written as it needed to be. So lets begin with the characters. We are introduced with the main character Heather Miller who is decently casted by the charismatic Alexandria Daddario. Her character has quite an interesting background, and the story manages to set up a somewhat promising premise. By then, the character development stops there, while the rest of the characters are left one-note and lack of appeal that many would find little to care for, and the acting leads little to be desired. Even worse however, is the plot which is arguably the worst aspect. Unlike the original 1974 film that had an original plot and direction, this one takes an absurd route by portraying the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface as an anti-hero than the serial killer he's well known as. When this occurs, the plot completely stumbles and the story becomes increasingly laughable. If there is any redeeming quality like the few jump scares that come infrequently, they are sadly buried under the film's painful execution and writing that simply doesn't fit the bill.Texas Chainsaw 3D is a sad and forgettable excuse of a horror remake that would be difficult to entertain even the least demanding horror fans. It is just another remake of a classic movie gone wrong, and it makes me hope that Hollywood would start hatching new and original ideas rather than litter with ill-fated remakes. Wanna see a scary movie of a serial killer slaying victims with a chainsaw? The original film is certainly the best choice.",Texas Chainsaw
55,Pumpkin_Man,A Worthy Follow Up to the Original Classic!!!,8,20 May 2013,"I'll admit I wasn't too thrilled with this the first time I saw it, but it really grows on you the more you watch it. In fact, I think it has a better storyline than the original. I love the opening and how they re- created how it looked in the 1974 film. This movie picks up right where the original left off. A mob of people come to the Sawyer house, burning it down to the ground. Leatherface and a baby escape the inferno. The baby is found by Gavin and Arlene, naming her Heather.39 years later (although Heather looks to be in her 20's) Heather is called back to Texas because her grandma has passed away and left her a mansion. When she arrives with her friends, Leatherface breaks loose and has a rip-roaring good time with his trusty chainsaw. From chasing them to a Halloween carnival and followed by an epic chainsaw fight conclusion at the original slaughterhouse, this is definitely one of the better films in this series. I highly recommend Texas CHAINSAW 3D!!!",Texas Chainsaw
56,IonicBreezeMachine,"This movie is unbelievably stupid and goes completely off the rails in the wrong direction, and yet I think you should see it",4,11 October 2021,"Following the events of the first film, the cannibalistic Sawyer family is killed by a violent mob lead by Burt Hartman (Paul Rae) as Sheriff Hooper (Thom Barry) impotently tries to quell the anger. The Sawyer home is burned to the ground with the only survivor a baby who's adopted by two of the mob. Years later Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario) receives correspondence that her biological grandmother, Verna Carson (Marilyn Burns), has died and left a will naming her as her heir. Heather learns of her adoption and travels to the town of Newt, Texas along with her boyfriend Ryan (Trey Songz), friends Nikki (Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (Keram Malicki-Sánchez), and hitchhiker Darryl (Shaun Sipos). When the group arrive and see Heather has inherited an mansion the group are exited, until it's discovered Jed ""Leatherface"" Sawyer lives in the basement of the house but Leatherface's rage is only half the danger as remnants of the original mob wish to wipe out the remaining Sawyer descendants including Heather.Following the lukewarm response to Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, Platinum Dunes let the rights to the franchise lapse until Lionsagte and Saw producers Twisted Pictures acquired the license. Eventually Twisted dropped out of development with noted B-movie production house Nu Image/Millennium stepping in who although known mainly for action films do occasionally venture into horror as evidenced by their middling remakes of It's Alive and Day of the Dead or the infamous Nicolas Cage Wicker Man remake. The movie was intended as something of a soft reboot ignoring the three sequels as well as the Platinum Dunes remake films instead serving as a direct follow on to the original film. Unfortunately while Texas Chainsaw 3D is entertaining, it's entertaining for all the wrong reasons as this is one of the dumbest most misguided entries in a legacied horror series of recent memory.The movie makes a fatal mistake by setting itself in present day and anchoring itself to the 1974 original film because the time scale creates a glaring logic gaffe where despite being born in 1974 shortly after the massacre Alexandra Daddario's Heather Miller only seems to be in her early 20s despite the fact that she was born, according to the death date on the tombstone, 38 years ago. This is already a pretty massive failure in internal logic and that would be bad enough, but to add to the fact the movie can't count, the characters are the most rock stupid bunch of idiots I've seen in a film of this type. These are the kinds of character's you'd write if you were making a parody of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre not an honest to goodness sequel and yet the actual parody Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 had stronger internal logic despite trying to be silly and ridiculous. From a moment where Heather is given a very important letter from Verna only to immediately chuck it aside to the group leaving the hitchhiker unattended in a house filled with valuables (which he predicably plunders) every decision these characters make is more boneheaded than the last and that's only the first half.The second half stops being a horror film and becomes a ""righteous"" revenge thriller with Leatherface framed as a victim of cruel mob justice and becoming an anti-hero rather than a monster.... I'll say that again just so there's no confusion: The cannibalistic berserker serial killer and his cannibalistic family are framed as ""victims"".....did these people SEE the original movie!? Now with all that said you're probably thinking this movie isn't worth your time, but not true. This movie should be seen by people for just how off the rails stupid it is. Much like the Nic Cage Wicker Man, this is a movie that completely fails at being a horror movie and plunges over the proverbial cliff into unintentional hilarity. Make no mistake, this movie is rock stupid but once you start it you won't go to the bathroom because your eyes will be glued to screen as ""what!?"" moments pile up in a car crash of stupidity.If you're looking for a faithful continuation/expansion of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre you're not going to find it here. If however you're looking for one of those rare bad movies that keeps you glued to the screen waiting for the next moment of embarrassing incompetence, then look no further because you've found it. Sure the Platinum Dunes TCM movies were probably better made than this, but they were never this entertaining.",Texas Chainsaw

This is when Heather finds she was adopted by new parents who moved away.Heather and friends drive to Texas and connect with the executor of the estate, who tells Heather to 'read the letter' from the deceased grandmother. He does not tell her that there is a huge serial killer locked up in her basement.Darryl, the drifter whom the group picked up along the way, says he'll help move in their stuff while they are getting food and supplies in town. He starts ripping them off, but finds Leatherface instead; end of Darryl. The group returns and discover the attempted thievery, but do not investigate enough to find the crime. While cooking, Kenny discovers the extra door Darryl found, and ends up with the same fate.Ryan, Heather, and Nikki attempt to escape in the van, but Leatherface catches them and kills Ryan. Heather runs to the local carnival; Nikki stays at the van with her deep leg wound. Carl challenges Leatherface, who throws his chainsaw at Carl, then runs off.Officer Marvin find the overturned van, then follows the blood trail. The Sheriff recognises the giant chainsaw that Carl brought in from the carnival. Marvin pursues to the mansion, and gets encouragement from the mayor via radio to follow the blood trail in defiance of the Sheriff's orders to stand down.Meanwhile, Heather reads all the police documentation of the slaughter of the Sawyers. Not surprisingly, she seems to be deeply affected by it all, and connects to her Sawyer roots.How does this all play out? The mayor is out to kill the last of the Sawyers. Heather is not too happy with the entire town since they murdered her natural family.

The music was reasonably good for building suspense and the sense of imminent danger.Acting: 5/10 Thom Barry, Paul Rae, Scott Eastwood, and Richard Riehle were fine. David Born and Sue Rock were OK as the Millers. Alexandra Daddario, Trey Songz, Tania Raymonde, Shaun Sipos, and Keram Malicki-Sanchez were just plain terrible.Screenplay: 2/10 The chronology does not make a whole lot of sense: Heather would be right around 40 years old, not a bit over 20. Nobody except perhaps the sheriff seemed to have aged in almost 40 years. The Sheriff's response to the endgame seemed hard to believe. Heather's profound switch was unbelievable as well. Leatherface had just murdered her lover and her close friends, after all. The worst part for me was the opening sequence. The Sawyer family from the 1974 film was irredeemably bad; that was essential to the pungency and originality of the first film. The family members portrayed at the beginning of this film was made out to be the innocent victims, decent people who should be left alone. No thanks. The clip after the closing credits was more true to form. That is where the plus two comes from.",Texas Chainsaw

59,ivo-cobra8,A peace a trash STINKER garbage!,1,9 August 2017,"*MAJOR SPOILERS* This is absolutely garbage STINKER the worst horror movie sequel ever made! The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was always the worst horror franchise and the sequels are absolutely the worst horror films! Texas Chainsaw 3D is a peace a  garbage movie! It is so bad material film that everyone in this movie is awful, the acting is trash, the writing is lazy the direction is terrible. Everyone from the actors and actresses in this movie are asshole and a scumbag they are not likable. I did not care about any of the characters and I did not had any mourn for leatherface at all. I hate this franchise and I blame Marilyn Burns for this disappointment failure! Who wrote this crap anyway? Why did Marilyn Burns return after 38 years in a cameo role to play the villain on the end of the film? She played a heroine in 1974 Sally Hardesty a likable beautiful character a hero and a soul survivor that everyone loved including me. But suddenly she played an aunt of leatherface on the end of the movie in a cameo role she played accomplice to a villain psycho serial killer! Just why? She sold her soul only to get a gab cash to get a paycheck. She was awful and she lost a respect by me because of this movie. She had a cameo role in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation why? Only to get a paycheck I guess. I hate this franchise and I hate the actress for making a cameo role to play a villain to a serial killer leatherface. Did Heather Langenkamp return in A Nightmare on Elm Street sequels to play a villain? No. Did Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween return to play a villain in any of the Halloween sequels? no. Did Amy Steel from Friday the 13th Part 2 return to play in any Friday the 13th sequels to play accomplice to a serial killer, no. Did Lar Park-Lincoln from Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood return to play the accomplice to a serial killer in the sequel's no. Did Lisa Wilcox from a Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master return in any of the sequels to play a cameo role a villain? No! No one of the actresses who played a heroine returned in a sh**ty cameo role but Marilyn Burns did that, that is why she lost my respect.This movie sucks a dick, should it suppose to be a family horror film or something? I did not cheer or mourn for any of the characters in this movie they were all assholes and unlikable! This movie turn in to a lead character Heather (Alexandra Daddario) from a shi**less victim, from a heroine to a villain in this film! Heather's friends are brutally murdered by Leatherface, whom she discovers to be her cousin, she feels sorry for him and loves him because he's ""family?! It's not even like he's a close relative. She doesn't even know him. One minute she's scared sh**less of him and the next she loves him AND helps him kill a couple more people?? Are we supposed to believe that her thought process was: ""Oh, hey Cuz, you just knocked me out in the kitchen, almost cut me up with a chainsaw in a coffin, tried killing me by flipping our van, chased me through a carnival with a chainsaw forcing me to hang on to a Ferris Wheel for my life AND killed all of my friends. But that's all okay.. I forgive you because we're family. Now I'm going to help you kill people and take care of you for the rest of my life."" All I could say was... Seriously... wtf just happened. She stabs a guy with a working tool fork trampled him and than she throw a chainsaw to Leatherface helped him to kill more people wtf! Her friends were all assholes the black guy who played Heather's boyfriend was cheating her with her best friend Nikki (Tania Raymonde). Her best friend Nikki is a junkie addicted to drugs we see her smoking a pot, that guy who played Darryl was a user and a thief he was stealing from the Sawyer house and he let leatherface out because of him people died. Alexandra Daddario stinks! She is the worst awful horrible actress in the movie business ever and Scott Eastwood is also horrible in this STINKER movie ever. F 1/10The original was a classic and a perfect good film. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 sucks too only Dennis Hopper was good in it. Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III in my opinion is the best sequel movie I like. We at least have likable characters we have young Viggo Mortensen, Ken Foree from Dawn of the Dead (1978) and of course Kate Hodge better actress and heroine than ugly Alexandra Daddario - her acting was horrible in this movie! The 2003 remake was awesome it was my first film of the TCM I saw and Jessica Biel was awesome bad ass and likable heroine she was Miles way better than Alexandra Daddario. I did not see Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation or The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning yet and I never will!",Texas Chainsaw
60,fernandoschiavi,"Some will defend the chase scenes, the dismemberments and the profuse blood . However, will they will be able to digest the humanization of one of the greatest horror icons?",4,8 August 2021,"Without a doubt, the 1974 classic The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of the most important films of all time in the horror genre, a film that kicked off several productions involving serial killers killing a group of young people. Even though the Tobe Hooper-directed film is one of cinema's greatest classics, the franchise has had no luck with sequels, which even if entertaining range from acceptable to bad. The producers and Lionsgate, responsible for the game of the game franchise had the idea of making a new sequel, ignoring all 5 movies they saw after the original, including the remake and the prequel of the remake. The idea was to make a sort of alternative sequel to the original movie, just like Halloween H20 did, ignoring other sequels.The opening serves to set the stage for audiences who are unaware of the feature film's legacy, which was inspired by the story of the American maniac Ed Gein, making a pre-credits cut with scenes that give a panorama of the original. The new film begins immediately after the climax of the seventies horror, introducing a dozen new characters, and follows a path that completely ignores all sequels. The film picks up where the original left off, showing the events after Sally managed to escape the Sawyer family. Tip for curious: Gunnar Hansen, 1974's Leatherface, makes a guest appearance in the opening, as does final girl Sally, eternal Marilyn Burns, as Heather's grandmother. Nothing more worthy than a good tribute, isn't it?Anyway, after escaping, she informs the local police about the events and the news spreads, driving fury to the local hillbillies, who decide to do justice on their own, setting fire and killing the entire family, leaving only one baby, or so they they think. Twenty years after these events, we meet Heather, a character played by Alexandra Daddario, who discovers that she has inherited a big house in the interior of Texas from a grandmother she didn't even suspect she had. She then leaves with some friends to the place - and the secrets of the city and its inhabitants do not take long to emerge.Slasher codes are followed to the letter: Heather's boyfriend, played by Trey Songz, is a cad and has already cheated on her with her pot-smoking friend (Tania Raymonde). Both are killed right after a private party in a barn that is in the vicinity of the house. The ""hitchhiker"" (Shawn Spos) tries to rob the house in a moment of hesitation in the gang, which makes him the first to encounter the fury of Leatherface, a creature that inhabits the basement of the place. The gang comic (Keram Malick Sanchez) also doesn't take long to find the antagonist's chainsaw, a harbinger of revenge that will be wrought in the city's barn, next to the epilogue, in a reunion marked by the presence of the indecisive sheriff (Thom Barry) and the mayor vindictive (Paul Rae).In a mix of sequel and reboot, Texas Chainsaw 3D at least manages to provide a new path. To work, good tact is needed from those involved in possible sequels. It is noteworthy that the approach is very courageous, as unlike what was done on Friday the 13th, the villain is almost totally humanized. In the remake of Jason's saga, despite the human side never before presented to the public, the maniac of unlucky Fridays remains faithful to his evil ""essence"", because no one is spared when his machete is at the ready.In the case of Leatherface and the script freedoms of this 3D version, the maniac showed that he can be tamed. Can anyone imagine a monstrously built man, who wears a human skin mask and whose sounds are only grunts, presenting himself as ""beautiful, demure and homely""? Is it possible that, as in the Scream franchise, he will win a partnership, perhaps, with his cousin? The twist at the end leaves this open. Gore fans, on the other hand, should appreciate Leatherface's (Dan Yeager)'s (regretfully few) kills - chainsaws look great in 3D - but that's a caveat to the psychopath's new status quo. Maniacs are maniacs... and if iconic villains are perceived as anti-heroes, what will be left for the future of the genre? By seeing Leatherface as a tame force, Chainsaw Massacre 3D - The Legend Continues sets a questionable precedent. There can be no redemption for forces of nature.With a little more care in the script and production, the film would be a worthy continuation of the original film. The movie starting where the first one left off was a hit and it's amazing how the setting is identical down to the smallest details with the 1974 film. And grandpa, who has not been forgotten (played by John Dugan, same actor in the original film). In addition to Leatherface's Drayton Sawyer Pai, played by the excellent Bill Moseley (The Chop Top of Chainsaw Massacre 2). The script blunder, however, appears in the first few minutes when showing the Sawyer family, this time made up of about 10 people, including Gunnar Hansen, in a completely unnecessary corner. In the original film, the family consisted of four members: Leatherface, brother, Father Drayton and Grandpa. Where did the rest of the family come from? This is just the first of several blunders in the script.The film follows with another script blunder, even worse. The film takes place in the present day, with the survivor Heather still a baby in 1974, she is about 20 years old, when she should have been around 40. Several moments are clear that the film takes place in the present day, the songs played on the radio and a scene that shows one of the characters with a smartphone and another with a crazy man dressed as a Jigsaw from the Mortal Games. The script presents yet another problem in not developing some characters in the first half. Heather's relationship with her adoptive parents was something that deserved more to justify the story's outcome. Everything happens very quickly, the girl discovers that a distant and unknown grandmother has died, discovers that she is adopted and that her parents have lied all the time and goes in search of inheritance with friends, without even reading the contract, or researching the family Sawyer.If the script is weak, the acting mediocre, the (almost) absence of outrageous nudity for the genre's roots, there is the big doubt about the film's qualities. At a time when the best-known cinematic serial killer goes by the name of Jigsaw (Saws), it is always good to remember characters that marked the history of independent cinema of being misused in works whose only intention is to drag teenagers into movie theaters. The director John Luessenhop even tried to maintain fidelity to the original (like the scenes where the camera follows the protagonist's footsteps using a very favorable angle, let's say), but without success or quality to do a good job. At least it was enough to guarantee the momentary joy of those who appreciate the Leatherface character and still entitled to some good scares.The violence and death scenes outweigh the remake. The make-up and gore effects were created by Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, responsible for almost every movie in the series, including the excellent Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. Among the best scenes is one where one of the characters is hung from a hook still alive and cut in half by the chainsaw and another where another character has his face cut off while still alive. The chase and run scenes are also good, some scenes manage to be tense like that of the Van attack, which is shown in the trailer.Alexandra Daddario is the only one who stands out in the cast, besides being the hottest protagonist of the series, perhaps tying only with Jessica Biel from the remake. The rest of the cast is divided between bad and acceptable. Unlike Sally, the audience will not like Heather. In addition to being stupid (not reading the letter, not finding out about the past, trusting anyone, hanging from a Ferris wheel), the new heroine does not convince in the scenes of despair. Just as other young people are far from the characterization of the original cast: the presence of the invalid Franklin in the classic was what allowed the public to identify with the characters, unlike these agency models. Dan Yeager even presents a Leatherface with some resemblance to the old one, although the script tries to spoil his performance in a scene where he sews the mask on his own face, in an obviously sensational attitude that came to be criticized in the remake.Whether the audience will be satisfied with the tributes and even find the chainsaw flying towards the camera amusing, taking advantage of the 3D feature, or the scene inspired by Dread in the City of Zombies, with the girl trapped in a coffin, is even likely. You're also likely to laugh at the quote to Death Games, in a park, and the fate of a character with a policeman's invasion of the mansion, but on closer examination you'll realize that the official sequel to the 1974 classic is just a horror movie traditional, full of clichés and easy solutions. The film starts to get lost when it reaches the end, when the film turns the plot around and innovates, although the ending is quite different by horror film standards, it ends up disappointing precisely because it is different from what was expected, in this case the typical cliché ending would be welcome. Remember what happens in The Tall Man? Because it's almost the same thing. An outcome that will surprise or disappoint. Some will defend the chase scenes, the dismemberments and the profuse blood as enough for entertainment. However, the question remains whether they will be able to digest the humanization of one of the greatest horror icons of all times and accept him as an anti-hero, justifying their past actions.",Texas Chainsaw
61,DarthVoorhees,A mess in Texas...,2,11 May 2013,"'Texas Chainsaw 3-D' is a bad movie to be sure but for the most part it isn't offensively bad. The film is just a big mess of nothing. It really elicits no passion from me one way or the other. I've seen thousands of bad films in this mold and some of them have made me very angry but 'Texas Chainsaw 3-D' can't even do that. It's really just taking the slasher track and letting it ride without any other concern.The original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is one of the great horror films. It lacks theatricality and feels very real and gritty. 'Texas Chainsaw 3-D' wants to borrow as much muster as it can from the classic 1974 film. The only redeeming feature of the film really is it's beginning which is sensational. A group of rednecks enact vigilante justice on the Sawyer clan. 'Texas Chainsaw 3- D' is shot very lazily without any eye for detail except for this beginning which looks very much in the vein of a 70's exploration flick. This could have been an excellent idea for a 'Texas Chainsaw' film if it were in the hands of a better writer and director who cared about the series.From then on out the film goes on slasher film autopilot and that's all there is to say. We get the laziest of slasher film cut out teens and cast in the roles are some of the worst actors and actresses I have seen in a film like this. The gore and killings don't even have any impact because the characters are that bad of stereotypes. I know slashers films aren't regarded well for stellar character development but in the best of the genre these victims have spunk even if they follow similar traits as the sacrificial lambs here. I want a slut, stoner, and jock who have fun being a slut, a stoner, and a jock.In most instances one doesn't go into this film rooting for the teens, they want an iconic killer. Leatherface is an institution of the horror genre and they don't do anything with him. He is merely there. 'Texas Chainsaw' is a simple concept, a mongoloid and his bizarre hillbilly family butchering people who wander into their backwoods. This film needlessly complicates everything. We get some contrived 'Halloween' rip off about Leatherface having a lost cousin. Why? It's silly and stupid. Leatherface needs a family behind him and they kill them off in the first act. I don't even know if this concept of the family would have worked because they appear to be millionaires with a cult family religion. Let me stress something else about this film that probably detracts the most from it. There are parts of it that are so incompetently directed that it almost becomes unwatchable. I don't mean unwatchable in it being bad but rather in that you cannot tell what is going on. The lighting and staging is so dark and disjointed that you can't tell who is chasing who or how Leatherface is attacking his victims. Dan Yeager might be a terrific Leatherface I just can't tell. You don't get a good look at him or how he moves. This is really just a lousy slasher film. I've seen worse really and this one is just so by the book that it really can't offend you too much. I just kind of wish a property like 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' could make a triumphant comeback because the Leatherface character is fun and interesting.",Texas Chainsaw
62,ersinkdotcom,"""Texas Chainsaw"" is an entertaining start for a new franchise based on Toby Hooper and Kim Henkel's original",8,15 May 2013,"Imagine, if you will, a world where ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2,"" ""Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III,"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation"" never happened. We won't even mention the remake and its sequel since they're not part of the original canon. The slate of what many consider inadequate follow-ups to the original is wiped completely clean. This scenario is exactly what ""Texas Chainsaw"" asks of its audience.Picking up immediately after the original 1974 film ended, ""Texas Chainsaw"" takes audiences back to the Sawyer homestead. Shortly after the police show up to arrest Leatherface (Dan Yeager), an unruly mob decides to take the law into their own hands. They burn down and kill all the family holed up in the house, with the exception of Leatherface and a woman protecting a baby. One of the townspeople kills the woman and takes the baby to raise on their own.Years later, the girl, Heather (Alexandra Daddario), discovers she was adopted and is a member of the Sawyers. Her grandmother (Marilyn Burns), who she never knew, dies and leaves her Texas home to the girl. Heather and her friends decide to take a road trip to see what she has inherited. They soon find out she's been left with a lot more than just an old house. She's also responsible for keeping the Sawyer family's secret locked safely away in the basement.Director John Lussenhop does a great job in his first foray into the horror genre. He attempts to bring a fresh approach to ""Texas Chainsaw"" and not rest on the laurels laid out by past entries in the franchise. He picks little bits and pieces from the original 1974 film and inserts them in certain scenes to pay tribute to it and give fans of the original some easter eggs to hunt.The Sawyer homestead was rebuilt from scratch based on screen captures and a visit to the original house, which is now a restaurant. Every detail of the house inside and out has painstakingly been reconstructed. It's eerie and gives the beginning of the movie an authentic flavor. My only minor complaints about ""Texas Chainsaw"" is the lack of the family dynamics seen in the first film. This movie focuses on Leatherface only. The absence of a psychotic ensemble of characters and the dark humor of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2"" are sadly missing. Those are both elements I believe drew audiences to the first two movies and set them apart from other slasher films.""Texas Chainsaw"" alumni play the different members of the Sawyer family. Gunnar Hansen (Leatherface in the original film), Bill Moseley (""Chop- Top"" Sawyer in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2""), and Marilyn Burns all play members of the Sawyer clan. John Dugan returns to play Grandpa again as well.Alexandra Daddario shows a different side of herself in ""Texas Chainsaw"" than we saw in ""Percy Jackson and the Olympians: The Lightning Thief."" She gets down and dirty and commands every scene she's in. Leatherface might have finally found a worthy guardian to keep him in line.I really had no major complaints about ""Texas Chainsaw."" I found it to be an entertaining and engaging start for a whole new series of films they're planning to release. It was graphic and gory like we've come to expect, but still had a sense of suspense to keep a viewer's attention.",Texas Chainsaw
63,acidburn-10,Ranks somewhere in the middle,5,1 June 2013,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of my favourite horror movies of all time with its gritty look and chilling and realistic feel was absolute perfection and then many sequels followed suit with mixed results but none that matched the original in terms of quality or greatness, then we got the remake in 2003 and the prequel in 2006 which were both stylish and gory and were welcome additions that saved the franchise after the awful part 4 which came in 1994, which nearly ruined the franchise altogether. It's been 7 years since the last one came out and in similar fashion not following any of the previous sequels and instead following on from the original, where we have a young woman finds out she was adopted upon hearing of the death of her grandmother and that she's inherited a house, she and her friends decides to head out to Texas to check it out, where she soon discovers that her family have a murderous history and plus a secret guest in her new home. I'd have to say that this one ranks somewhere in the middle of the franchise, which I must say that I personally liked this one, the opening credits which show clips of the first movie was fun and then the shoot out was wonderfully shot and fun. The storyline was also rather interesting, the female lead Alexandra Daddario who plays Heather gave a likable turn and someone to root for, but her friends were just typical slasher movie fodder and weren't really fleshed out at all they were just portrayed as selfish moronic idiots. Another letdown of this movie was the total stupidity of some of the characters which seemed almost deliberate by the film makers, like when the copper following the trail of blood run throughout the house on his own instead of waiting for backup and of course then you know what's going to happen, or when the group of friends trust a hitchhiker to look after the house while they're out, or the most cheesiest part is when the girl is hiding in the coffin, which I do admit I did rather like that part, but it does take away any sort of tension or realism.Despite some of it's failings there are some rather decent moments in this movie, and there are some exciting scenes, the chase through the amusement park between Leather face and Heather was a definite highlight and nail biting and the scene with the guy getting sawed in half was rather intense and cool and the face lift scene was rather unsettling, and I did also like the ending, where Heather makes a fun transition from good to bad, which was different, but an angle which I rather liked.All in all I am a big fan of the franchise, even the bad ones and this one falls somewhere in the middle, yes it was fun but there could have been some more deaths, but overall a decent entry.",Texas Chainsaw

You do get what you expect which is plenty of gore, a far fetched story line and a mindlessly enjoyable film. This is no acting masterclass although to be fair the cast are not bad at all. Alexandra Daddario is nice to watch and the supporting cast do their best with limited material. This is a slasher movie and you get your moneys worth of gore and a few pretty tense scenes. As an easy to watch slasher this works pretty well, it moves along at a swift pace, has all the elements you'd expect in this type of film and is well executed.

67,dfa120374,"Not Bad, But Definitely Not Good",5,10 December 2014,"Texas Chainsaw is about a young girl who inherits her deceased grandmothers estate in Texas. Knowing nothing about who her original family were, and where she really came from, she goes to claim her new property. Not long after arriving, however, things start going terribly wrong.This movie takes place after the original (and much over-hyped) Texas Chainsaw Massacre and follows on from the events that happened in 1974. It's a nice idea but unfortunately kinda falls flat on it's face as not much makes sense due to one main reason - how a girl who was born in 1974 is only about 21 or 22 yet everyone else from 1974 looks exactly the same. You may think ""simple - the movie's set in the mid 90s"" but it's not and you know this because the cops use smart phones and they didn't come out till well into the 2000s. Knowing this then you know that the movie's setting is at least 35 years later. If it's not supposed to be, then it's a MAJOR movie mistake. There are other things that don't make sense but you'll find these as you watch the movie.As for the main characters, well they are of your stereotypical variety: we have the innocent angelic girl, the slut, the black jock/athlete, the ""party dude"", and the stranger (a hitchhiker in this case). While most are not too overly annoying, you won't feel much sympathy for many of them (in fact I felt more sympathetic towards Leatherface to be honest), and you may find yourself feeling rather pleased when they start getting picked off.I enjoyed Texas Chainsaw Massacre (the remake that is as I thought the original sucked) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning, but Texas Chainsaw is not a patch on those two and gets pretty boring in all honesty. It's basically a gory popcorn movie with a few cheesy lines thrown in (""Do your stuff, cuz!"").Worth a watch but nothing to write home about.",Texas Chainsaw
68,Rickting,Why?,4,26 January 2015,"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, despite the horrid title, is a very good horror flick which is more than just tasteless exploitation. Ignoring the previous sequels, this takes place 40 years after the original. A member of the Sawyer family, who were slaughtered, has survived and she returns to collect her inheritance but runs into her brutal, chainsaw wielding cousin, Leatherface. Why was Texas Chainsaw 3D made? It didn't even make that much money, so why? Just why? TC often feels like an action film, as it's not scary and consists mainly of chase sequences. It reminds us how much we'd rather be watching the original by using footage from it. This is your typical January movie and it just isn't scary. It uses cheap jump scares which are only scary for a few seconds and can be seen from a distance. The emphasis is not on tension, but on fake looking CGI gore which is not scary at all, and simply exists so that cinemas can charge extra for people to experience this through irritating 3D glasses and therefore this worthless trash will make more money than it deserves.To be fair to the film, it's a bold move for the franchise. It turns Leatherface into an antihero, and the chase sequences despite not being scary can be exciting. It's not what you expect and is often watchable, but the plot is what lets it down. The story makes about as much sense as Leatherface riding a unicycle on the wing of a commercial airliner while juggling 3 chainsaws. It's that stupid. The characters continuously make stupid decisions. The main character does not open an envelope which would have allowed everything which happens in this film to be avoided. Characters go down into an obviously dangerous cellar. The protagonist, as the film takes place in 2012/3 and she was born in 1974 should be 38 or 39 years old, but she's in her 20s! How did they overlook that? Bad acting and poor writing, which fills the story with holes and reduces the characters to stereotypes, let the entire film down. It's also a fairly tasteless movie; objectifying its female characters and expecting us to feel sympathy for a murderous family of cannibals.4/10",Texas Chainsaw
69,hellholehorror,Strange morality tale,6,5 October 2017,"The tone and style were probably the closest to the original film out of all the sequels, prequels and remakes so far. The film started very much like the original but changed into a strange morality tale where you felt compassion for Leatherface. I would have preferred to see him solely as the villain. It's still a fun ride with plenty of violence and slightly tacky 3D elements. The first true sequel with the same spirit is as you would hope. Shame it took nearly 40 years.",Texas Chainsaw

Going into the film, the expectation of its namesake called Texas Chainsaw 3D would make it the third entry to the 2003 remake and The Beginning. Instead the beginning of the story is said to take place directly after the events of the 1974 film, which makes zero sense whatsoever. Where did all these other family members come from? How does all of a sudden this huge town just pop up randomly close to house site? It does absolutely nothing to line itself up with other films in the franchise. That is complete laziness on the writer's part who we think would pay some respect to its original predecessors. There are no redeeming actors or characters, oh and spoiler. Never portray an iconic villain such as Leatherface as a moral character. He is obviously best when he's the bad guy.

I was expecting a bad movie from the trailer. In fact, I was at least expecting it to be bad the point where it was at least fun to watch (like Drive Angry- such a terrible film but so fun and enjoyable for that reason), but WOW, and I don't mean that in a good way. In fact, I'd be impressed that a movie this bad has been released if not for the fact that it tries to sell itself as a Texas Chainsaw movie.It really isn't. Instead we get some lame thriller about a bunch of redneck cops mad at a guy for causing family tensions. Alright, so there's some good chainsaw brandishing action in the first half and some good use of the meathook. Oh, there's some drop dead beautiful and stunningly hot guys to eyeball for that portion of the film, but sadly no naked women or boobs. What is a horror film without boobs? Sadly, that portion of the film is most interesting until everyone with the protagonist dies. And then comes one of the most intelligence insulting scenes of all time, where the protagonist runs through a county fair, and Leatherface runs through the fair without chainsawing anyone. And then, the protagonist decides that the best way to escape Leatherface is to, and I'm not making this up, grab the edge of a ferris wheel bench and ride it to the end... Then suddenly a hot policeman shows up and Leatherface throws his chainsaw at him (and misses) and runs away. I'm not making that up. Then the most inept police officers in the history of film show up and go to a crash scene, and then one suddenly goes to a house ALONE (even I know that wouldn't ever be allowed in real life) and accidentally shoots someone... And the police officers on the other hand don't get mad. Meanwhile, in the main chick's story, she's apparently related to Leatherface... And he suddenly becomes an anti-hero.

76,JBoze313,Equal to the original- so much fun,9,10 January 2013,"I've been looking forward to this for, I guess, about two years now. The very idea of a new TCM just excites me. A massive fan of the original, I liked most of what came after, minus the terrible New Generation sequel which stunk. I even liked TCM2 and Leatherface a lot. I just like the series, and the character of leatherface is creepy as heck in general. I personally loved this one. 10 mins or so in, I wasn't sure how I felt. The girl's family was too over the top redneck, some of the dialog was a bit silly, but it felt like a true homage to the original, a loving tribute made by people who I suspect truly adored the first film. The introduction to leatherface is brilliant, the house itself is super creepy, the stairs, the door so very much like the door in the original, the kills were inventive enough, and there was a good deal of atmosphere. When that chainsaw starts and it overpowers every other sound- it's scary as hell. I had issues with the timeline, of course (wouldn't she be in her 40's in the present day? How on earth did the police chief look younger today than in 1974? etc), and I had issues with some of the stuff the characters did (SPOILER!!!- If Heather's friends were just butchered, why is she calmly reading through documents in the police station, okay to be left alone- if I had a run-in with leatherface, I'd demand never to be alone again in my life, including trips to the bathroom and shower! That just didn't ring true at all- she seemed way too composed and way too easy with being left alone to browse newspaper clippings...speaking of which, that scene went on WAY too long, and what was with the constant camera pans over various parts of the documents? It hurt my eyes...just have the character read the info. out loud for heaven's sake). So, yeah, not a perfect movie, but it was so much fun, it was scary enough, it had enough inventive kills that I looked past those problems. This, for me, might be equal to the original. In some ways, I might even go as far to say it's superior. The house, for example, is way more creepy...that long stairway down and the metal door beyond it, yikes!!I loved every minute of it. 9/10 for sure.",Texas Chainsaw
77,rgblakey,Leatherface is back in Texas Chainsaw 3D,5,6 January 2013,"When the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre hit theaters in 1974 it changed horror forever. While the film may not seem all that terrifying now at the time of its release it faced all kinds of controversy being banned in some countries and getting the dreaded X rating before being recut. After 3 sequels, a remake, and a prequel to the remake, the saw is back with Texas Chainsaw 3D as a direct sequel to the original 1974 classic. Can it slice its way back into a new series or will it stall once again? Texas Chainsaw 3D picks up where the original massacre ends as a vigilante mob surrounds the Sawyer house with the intent to kill every last one of them. Decades later a young woman learns she has inherited an estate from her grandmother that she has never met, so her and her friends take a road trip out to check it out, but soon realize that she inherited more than just a house. The idea of connecting to this film to the original was a pretty cool idea and delivered a pretty cool opening to the film. While the always great Jim Sedow has passed on and clearly unable to reprise his role as Drayton Sawyer, the always great Bill Moseley stepped into the role complete with signature buck teeth. Once the film kicks into its current storyline it introduces a new set of teens destined for the terror, but most of the performances were average at best. This is pretty normal for these types of films and the lead does decent enough, but overall most of the acting is pretty lax. With the exception of a couple of people, there never really seemed too much urgency by anyone. The story actually works pretty well taking the Leatherface character in a new direction, even aging him with the time adding a new element to the legend. The pacing is a bit slow trying to build the tension as well as formatting it similar to the original film, but doesn't work as well already knowing what's coming. The story is pretty obvious where it's headed for the most part, with a few moments that make little to no sense, but still manages to deliver a pretty fun addition to the franchise. The 3D add very little to the film, although there are a couple of stereotypical moments that work pretty well.This film doesn't add all that much to the genre and plays it pretty much by the numbers, but thanks to the twist ending it sets it up to take it in a new direction for this generation. Prepare to see Leatherface like you have never seen him before with this film as it humanizes him a bit for the first time. Be on the lookout for cameos of two of the original actors in the film beyond just the archive footage. While some will not enjoy the film as a whole, the opening and ending are worth the entire thing. There is talk of delivering a new franchise with up to seven new films and the end of this one defiantly creates some interesting possibilities.",Texas Chainsaw

80,DustinRahksi,Surprisingly good.,6,5 January 2013,"I went into this film expecting a bad movie, well it's bad movie, but good in the horror genre. I just got back from seeing it and these are my first impressions. Let's get the flaws out of the way first. The script was average, no harm in that. The main characters served one purpose, getting chopped up. I still don't know who this Trey Songz is, and don't get why people talked about it so much, by the way he is a complete sleaze ball, and got what was coming to him. The 'sluty' character was complete garbage and very UN-attractive, bad casting. Then there's those other two guys that I don't even know their names. They were one dimensional to the extreme. To some them up, they are pretty stupid. Then we got these crazed town folk, who would you believe it or not are worse than the sawyers. And for that the movie is turned on it's head. Think about it, Leatherface is not the villain, that's got to be a first for a slasher movie. Sure he kills people, but you don't care for the characters, and most of them were doing bad things, such as robbery or murder. The heather character started off being worthless, but she got better as the film progressed. The Texas chainsaw massacre was the first horror movie I ever bought, and it holds a special place in my heart, so it was only natural that I felt bad for Leatherface. There was an amusing part where he enters a carnival, but he doesn't kill anyone, which means he is not a mindless killing machine. The only people he kills pose a threat or danger to him, so he is not just doing it for s**ts and giggles, Besides, those psychotic rednecks got what they deserved. I coming off as a symphasizer to a chainsaw wielding killer, but I'm simply stating the facts. The 3D effects were gimmicky, which was to be expected. Aside from a few jump scares the film wasn't overly scary, but it was very suspenseful. The violence was pretty grisly, they don't cover up anything, it's all there for you to see. The best kill being someone getting sawed in half, with some bloody result's. I think it's a worthy sequel to the original. If your looking for some good Ol'slasher horror check it out.",Texas Chainsaw
81,Fields201,Rather Watch The Remakes,4,4 January 2013,"I have a confession: I liked the two remakes by Platinum Dunes. I thought they were entertaining, dumb horror films and dare I say it, actually kinda scary. They weren't masterpieces or anything but I enjoyed them for the most part so when I found out yet another Texas Chainsaw movie was coming out, and even though I wasn't impressed with the trailer, I decided to go see it.What was I thinking?I think you are forced to see it in 3D because, well, it says 3D on it but most of the time you forgot you are even watching it in 3D. It adds nothing to this movie. The movie starts off showing clips of the very original Texas Chainsaw Massacre which confused me because it totally obliterates the remakes. Actually it ignores the sequels too as the story picks off from there. It starts off with these hicks burning down the home of Leatherface and his family and one of the hicks takes a baby and kills the mother. Flash-forward to.... how many years later? Is it supposed to be 2012 because the baby should around forty, not in her early twenties as she clearly looks like. Anyway, she finds out she inherited this house and her and her cookie-cutter friends and some hitchhiker who appears nice only turns out to be a thief all go there. Then Leatherface turns out to be in the basement and all hell breaks loose.This movie is so stupid I don't know where to begin. Well, the actions of the characters are just stupid. Before I get into that, though, there is one good scene in the film when Leatherface is chasing them but it all goes downhill from there. The movie offers up these turn of events that make no sense whatsoever. A cop goes back to the house alone and there is no backup anywhere in sight for one lone cop in a house with a crazed psycho with a chainsaw. Then characters turn bad for stupid reasons and one of them that played an intricate part of the storyline just disappears somewhere, never to be heard from again. Then by the end of the film, I don't even know who to root for the main heroine turns completely idiotic. Oh, and the ending just plain sucked. This film is bad in so many levels. I kept thinking, ""Who wrote this crap?"" in so many parts of the movie. There wasn't many people at the theater either and I saw it at a night showing. If that's an indication, there might not be another Texas Chainsaw movie. Oh well.",Texas Chainsaw
82,lnvicta,Hot garbage,4,20 February 2020,"The TCM franchise hasn't had a great movie since the original, so no surprise, this one sucks too.It opens with a montage of kills from the original, except with loud music stings every time Leatherface pops up just to remind you it's a crappy modern horror movie right off the bat. The main story is about a baby who survived a slaughter at Leatherface's house after the events of the first film. She's all grown up now and she and her friends are taking a trip to Texas to claim her inheritance; little does she know she's Leatherface's long lost cousin. Needless to say, when she and her friends show up, bodies start piling up.On the way there, they pick up a hitchhiker who looks like an Abercrombie & Fitch model (a clear homage to the original). Then they arrive to an enormous luxury mansion, which now belongs to Alexandra Daddario's character. So naturally, the first thing they do is leave the house in the care of the hitchhiker they just met. I can't stress enough how dumb this movie is.Everyone looks like they just walked out of their makeup trailer. Nothing is grimy and authentic like in the first TCM. It all feels so phony. Not to mention the terrible acting, lame kills, and complete lack of nudity. They tease Alexandra Daddario's glorious tits and there are some good low-angle ass shots, but that's not nearly enough for a movie this bad. I mean, give us SOMETHING.If you're drunk or high enough, there are some good laughs here. Otherwise, I can't think of a single reason why you should watch this steaming pile of trash.",Texas Chainsaw

As I look at box office results nothing seems to impress me, unless they are December releases or Oscar nominated movies. For the past two years, the first major release of the year was a horror film, and in 2013, Texas Chainshaw 3D was the example. Watching this movie I knew exactly what I was experiencing: an escapism flick. This is the kind of movie I view whenever I wanna have a fun evening getting off from watching blood splatter all over the place. The acting is as you'd expect average, the direction textbook horror and the film as a whole serves its purpose of arousing horror junkies who enjoy these films.

85,TheRadiobox,Texas Chainsaw 3D: Relentlessly idiotic.,1,12 May 2019,"Normally, i don't take the time to write long reviews, normally i save them for films that i adore. Not this time, this one is way too irritating to leave be.
It's rare that a movie makes me this angry. But, let's look on the bright side;The Pros: Some of the gore. There's some fingers sliced off by the titular chainsaw that looked convincing and a shot of a character getting bashed in the head that was semi effective.The Cons: Everything else.The acting is terrible from everyone, even Alexandra Daddario and Scott Eastwood, the only talented people that are involved. From the beginning i got a feeling of nervousness, not due to the movie's tension (because there isn't any) but because of the abysmal writing courtesy of Stephen Susco, Adam Marcus, Debra Sullivan, and Kirsten McCallion.It starts out with a standoff directly following the '74 original which could've been interesting if the rest of the movie actually followed what was set up. But no, we get cameo appearances from people (that aren't Daddario or Eastwood) that can act. Even the shootout that ensues is boring, the house is burned down and it looks awful. Shortly after, the Millers find a woman who somehow survived the house being peppered with bullets and burnt to a crisp holding a baby, who becomes our ""protagonist"" later. Heather has a burn mark on her boob and this presents a mystery for her, but not the audience. There's no ambiguity surrounding her since we see where she came from.Cut to 40 years later and we find out that she's become a butcher (this doesn't even come into play later) and we're properly introduced to her friend, who immediately is unlikable since she rings an alarm just to tell her that she's ready to have sex with her new hookup. Cut to Heather's place and we now meet Ryan, her boyfriend who's not much better than Nikki. Anyway, i'll spare you the other moron.On their way to Newt, Texas, they (literally) run into Darryl, and he isn't bothered by being hit by a van. In fact, he wants to tag along with them, and none of them are suspicious of this. Unsurprisingly he turns out to be bad news. So we still don't have a character to root for. Great. More problems arise (not ones to be solved, just continuity problems) when we see inside the house, Leatherface would be pushing 70 during the events of this movie, and he's still nimble as he was four decades ago. So that's already stupid writing. Why set this movie in the then current year if it doesn't make sense? Ten years later? Maybe. Forty? That's just dumb.Alexandra Daddario doesn't do anything to make the audience care, we see Darryl and Kenny get killed, not even Heather seems to care. The characters from the opening are reintroduced and a moral quandary is presented but goes nowhere, just like everything else in this poor excuse for entertainment. We get the standard slasher affair, no flair or spice to it. Heather's other friends are killed, and the best she can muster as a reaction to her best friends being killed is mild annoyance.Hartman (who was the one who initiated the shooting in the beginning) wants to finish the job when he finds out about Leatherface's survival. Heather, who forms a very tight bond with the cousin who killed her friends, takes Leather's side because... why? And the sheriff lets Leatherface and Heather go after seeing them throw Hartman into a meat grinder for some reason. The writers even have the audacity to try to make the audience feel sympathy for the GUY THAT KILLED 11 PEOPLE.The movie winds down, not that anything but a chainsaw ever even revved up to begin with. And Heather only now reads the letter she was given in the first 15 minutes and was explicitly to read. The best part? IT LITERALLY TELLS HER THAT ALL OF THE EVENTS OF THE MOVIE WERE PREVENTABLE. So, we learned nothing except Trey Songz' acting is even worse than his music, and that apparently Leatherface is an incorporeal being who can phase through a huge locked metal door that can only be opened by a key that hasn't been used in four decades, and that he doesn't need food to survive.That's it. All in a day's work from the people behind Texas Chainsaw 3D. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt because i thought that no sequel could be worse than any of the ones before. Oh how wrong i was. 1/10, one of the worst movies i've ever had the displeasure of watching.",Texas Chainsaw
86,nashw82,Entertaining addition to the franchise,6,3 November 2020,"While this definitely isnt anything new or astounding its a fun watch and it has some new story to add to the lore. Don't let the haters bring it down, they are clearly taking things too seriously. The original is a groundbreaking Classic and should be taken seriously but once it became a franchise you need to view all subsequent films through a different lens.
This interesting tale kicks off soon after original as the family faces the consequences of their actions. It's called to see Bill Moseley there but he doesnt really get to do a lot.
We then jump forward in time to catch up with the surviving members of the family and bring this tale into more modern times. A fine young lady who follows the family footsteps of working as a butcher and making art from bones. A family inheritance bring her and her friends to Texas and the tension slowly builds from there.
With more than enough blood violence and a fair amount of chainsaw swinging to keep you entertained, this is a fun watch for horror fans.",Texas Chainsaw
87,bushtony,This is very poor,2,3 May 2013,"Considering the widespread genre influence of Tobe Hooper's original and controversial grindhouse classic, this is probably the most uninspired offshoot anyone could conceivably have come up with.To cut a short story shorter, in 1973 a posse of redneck vigilantes torch and riddle with bullets the bodies and home of a family of murdering cannibalistic inbreds following the events of the original film. The survivors are a female infant and the chainsaw toting butcher Leatherface. The infant is adopted by husband and wife members of the redneck vigilante posse and Leatherface is missing, presumed dead.Fast forward to 2012 and aforementioned infant is a hot chick in her early twenties. She inherits a mansion from the grandmother she never knew she had and discovers Leatherface is living there in his own compact and bijou basement apartment complete with adjoining slaughter room. But wait a minute, this can't be right. Chick would be in her forties. Soooo should we assume this must be a follow on from the 2003 remake even though the intro credits roll over footage from the 1974 original? But...was the remake also set in 1973? Yes, I do believe it was.And that's only the start of the continuity distortions and other anomalies which kick off this blatantly unashamed cash-in. Add to that the 3D gimmick and all you really have is a monumentally careless, thoughtless and mindless attempt to milk the cow until it is bone dry.This is very poor. Thoughfful logic need not rigidly apply in these types of films, but some consideration or at least a passing nod to a vague semblance of rational construction and content needs to be in place to help with suspension of disbelief. Here, there is absolutely none of that.The script and dialogue are hopelessly mediocre and inane. The performances are shockingly substandard across the board and do nothing to convincingly engage on any level. The attempt made to generate sympathy for the monstrous cannibal family and the subhuman Leatherface, re-focusing them as misunderstood victims, is a complete and utter miscalculation and one that fails miserably.Monsters can be sympathetic, and some of the best ones are, but the characters herein were never conceived that way. They are mad, bad and dangerous slaughterers of innocents, depraved beyond redemption. To re-imagine them as disenfranchised poor folk just trying to get by in a cruel world and Leatherface as some sort of heroic idiot man-child trapped in the body of a rabid gorilla is simply a hysterical screw-up. If the audience is expected to identify with their plight and root for the monster, then this requires some masterful screen writing narrative by someone who has immensely creative literary and conceptual skills. Lines from our female protagonist such as ""Do your thing, cuz"" just ain't gonna cut it. Surely at some point in the proceedings someone must have had a brief notion that none of this makes any contextual sense. Well, if they did, they strangled that notion at birth and just carried on regardless. Which is somewhat of an insult to the audience.What we end up with is ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" the paint-by-numbers version, rendered by a blind person with ADHD. Uncoordinated, lacking vision and creatively misconceived. If you part with your money, you contribute to the success of the marketing exercise this clearly was designed to be. Then they might make another one. And that would be a bitching shame and a half.",Texas Chainsaw

89,By-TorX-1,Cuts Itself Down To Size,4,5 October 2017,"Texas Chainsaw is a very pointless film, and wields a chainsaw that clearly has no real teeth. The 3D gimmick quickly becomes tiresome as there are only so many random objects that can be pointlessly pointed at the screen (and when you watch it on TV, it is all null and void anyway), but the plot simply is not there and doesn't really add up (a murderous gang in a rambling house having a millionaire benefactor? A funfair crowd that pretty much ignores a chainsaw-swinging maniac in hot pursuit of a defenceless young woman?). Also, the main narrative premise makes no real sense in terms of the side we, the good viewers, are supposed to take. OK, there is some unlawful vigilante antics at the outset that sees off the Chainsaw clan, but are we really supposed to be that moved? This is a family that ruthlessly kills all who fall into their clutches, an ethos carried on by the surviving Leatherface (shacked up in palatial splendour, to boot), so the sense of moral outrage expressed by Heather (and the Sheriff) is really weird. Oh dear, the nascent Mayor eliminated a group of murderous cannibals in his youth, how awful! I sure hope that justice is served and that Heather and her human face-wearing Charge live happily ever after (with Heather effortlessly overlooking how 'Cuz' brutally butchered her boyfriend and best friend, but family is family, I guess). The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a triumph of '70s nihilistic horror, but this slick, CGI-filled, 3D-charged farrago just needed to be hung on a meat hook. Très bad.",Texas Chainsaw

The middle part is half decent and what you expect for this series. 3. The female lead and her friend are very attractive. 4. Decent special effects. 5. Nice highlights from the original movie at the beginning.Negatives:1. Where did all these family members come from that wasn't in the 1st movie? Terrible answer to what happened after the woman escaped. 2. Are you really suppose to feel sympathy for a family who killed 4 people in the 1st movie and implied they killed countless others? They deserved to be shot and burned but the movie says it was wrong. 3. Why is everyone a jerk in the movie? One guy steals, 2 people cheat, people abusive, lying, etc. Only the boyfriend of the lead actress's friend wasn't, and he was the most brutally killed. Come to think of it, the mayor wasn't either, he did what had to be done, and he was the 2nd most brutally killed. Too bad the movie thought he was a jerk. 4. Too many clichés like the officer going to the house and not waiting for BACKUP! Guess what happened to him. 5. Tombstone scene showing grandma died in 2012, meaning 39 years after the 1st movie, yet no one aged that much. Eating human meat must keep the body young as Leatherface at 60 something moves awfully well. 6. This must be the only carnival in Texas that no one carries a gun. Also, amazingly, Leatherface doesn't cut anyone with the chainsaw moving thru the crowded carnival. 7. A van with a cut tire flipping over. That doesn't happen. 8. A sheriff who believes in equal rights for serial killers. Just absurd. 9. Terrible ending. Trying to have sympathy for Leatherface? How did anyone think that was a good idea? He's suppose to be scary! 10. Lead actress who suddenly forgets Leatherface killed her good friend and boyfriend, and now loves him because he's her cousin. Terrible! 11. How does a sheriff lose a deputy, see on video 3 cut up bodies, and just tell Leatherface to clean up his mess? Fire the script supervisor! 12. Leave evidence out so someone else can look thru it. Always the incompetent police dept. If that were true today, the US would still be like the wild west. 13. Have to take care of Leatherface? Let the cannibal rot. 14. If it wasn't for the thief, would Leatherface ever have gotten out of the house? How did he survive when Grandma died? 15.

92,Minus_The_Beer,Chainsaw Franchise Runs Out of Gas,5,6 October 2013,"Texas Chainsaw (2013), directed by John Luessenhop. 92 minutes.Plot: Picking up directly after the events of Tobe Hooper's landmark 1974 ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre,"" the latest, ADHD-titled entry in the franchise, ""Texas Chainsaw,"" finds the Sawyer family somehow multiplying (?) and including, of all things, a young baby who will grow up to be strong-headed but troubled nevertheless. When Heather (Alexandra Daddario) finally comes of age, which by all calculations means she should be about 40, not only does she have the youthful appearance of a 21 year old, but she has also unwittingly inherited her family's (mis)fortune, which includes her crazy cousin Leatherface. A road trip with a group of friends naturally ends in tears and a little bloodshed.Writing and Directing: One of the writers, Adam Marcus, brought you the cinematic masterpiece, ""Jason Goes To Hell: The Final Friday,"" so you know this one's gotta be good. No wait, that other thing. Bad. Very bad. While ""Jason Goes To Hell"" could be at least entertaining at times for turning its franchise's conventions on its head while delivering buckets of gore in the process, ""Texas Chainsaw"" is an exercise in redundancy. The plot borrows from too many horror films of days past, and rather than pay homage or at least wink at the camera, the film-makers have the nerve to play it straight, as if the tired concepts they introduce are somehow their own. John Luessenhop's direction is nothing beyond serviceable. The film looks OK for what it is, but given virtually nothing to work with, the film can't help but look and feel like substandard direct-to-video fare, which it truly is.Cast:A young rapper by the name of Trey Songz who has never been in a film before is featured prominently in the cast, so you know that the producers took the utmost care in hand-selecting a roster of seasoned actors who could emote and evoke true fright in their performances. Or, you know, that other thing. Songz (Lord, it pains me to even type that) isn't even the least of the casting issues, as most of the other actors look like they just stepped off the set of some Jim Wynorski-directed skin-flick for Cinemax (and not in a good way). The aforementioned Daddario in the lead role does the best with what she's given, but even cameos from franchise luminaries such as Bill Moseley, Gunnar Hansen and Marilyn Burns don't do much to breathe life into the proceedings. The always reliable Richard Riehle makes a comforting appearance and Thom Barry does a good enough job as the town sheriff, but that's about it.Music: Nothing memorable, but no songz from Trey Songz (as far as I could tell), so that's a plus, right? The Bottom Line(s): The ""Chainsaw"" series of films has to be without a doubt one of the most confusing and frustrating franchises in the annals of horror history. ""Texas Chainsaw"" does little more than rub salt in the wound.Lesson Learned: If you're writing a movie, at least get your math right. 38 years have passed between 1974 and 2012. Please make sure your main character (you know, the one that your credibility hinges on) reflects the appropriate age.",Texas Chainsaw
93,tbmforclasstsar,every cliché in modern horror movies rolled up into a painful hour and a half,1,5 January 2013,"John Luessenhop's Texas Chainsaw 3D is a bad, bad movie. You know this. I know this. Unfortunately the producers and studio that backed this latest incarnation of Tobe Hooper's original genre-creating slasher film ignored what we, the audience, already knew, and decided to milk the franchise-cow for the sixth (and hopefully, final) time.This new reimagining (as Hollywood likes to call it) starts off promising with archive footage of the original film. That was the first five minutes. After that, the movie spirals into unexplained and implausible territory, asking its audience not only to suspend disbelief, but disregard it completely.The 2012 version of Texas Chainsaw is a direct sequel of the original, with the prologue taking place in 1974. Vigilantes show up at the infamous Sawyer home where the murders of several young adults literally just happened and proceed to torch it to the ground in a fit of vengeance. Amongst the chaos, a young Sawyer woman with an infant is found hiding in the garage. Then, in a laughably inane act of kindness followed by harsh brutality, one of the vigilantes saves the baby girl and randomly kicks the Sawyer woman square in the face.If there was anything 2011's The Cabin in the Woods has taught us, it's that ridiculously attractive young adults will always venture out to parts unknown for no reason and behave in ways normal human beings would never agree to in real life given eerie circumstances.Cut to Heather Mills (starring Alexandra Daddario's midriff and breasts). She finds out she inherited a home in Texas after her previously unknown grandma passed away while simultaneously discovering she's adopted. Usually this would tear at the soul of a normal person, being lied to your entire life by people you thought were your parents, but no. Heather's first instinct is to collect on her inheritance by dragging along her boyfriend, Ryan (Tremaine 'Trey Songz' Neverson), her best friend, Nicole (Tania Raymonde), and Nicole's boy toy (Keram Malicki-Sanchez) on an impromptu road trip. Along the way, they pick up a hitchhiker named Darryl (Shaun Sipos), apparently to add to the inevitable body count.Texas Chainsaw fails to mention the time discrepancy as the original film took place in the 1970s and this new film clearly states it's 2012. Heather should be pushing 40, but no bother. In a movie like this, the only thing that matters is the gore, the scantily clad women, and the infamy of the original.To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/Texas- chainsaw-3d/",Texas Chainsaw
94,Michael-Hallows-Eve,"Good gore, but massive gaping plot flaws!",2,4 May 2013,"-- SPOILER ALERT -- Where do I start? Well there are a few mistakes in this film right from the start, the major one being the time-line. How can a girl born in 1974 only be in her early 20's in 2012? The main character (Heather Miller played by Alexandra Daddario) should have been 38 years old!! And Sheriff Hooper should have been in his 60's at least, along with the Mayor!! But some how they were only in their 40's by the look of them. And would you leave someone you just met in a house full of silverware while you and your friends go off to get some groceries? I think not! So that annoyed me from the first scenes. I have to say though that Alexandra Daddario is an attractive woman (those eyes - amazing), and she did play her part well. But apart from that the rest of the film fails, and the 3D aspect wasn't needed, the plot is full of holes as a result of the time-line fail, and on a side note, how can you be reading a newspaper about a massacre on the same day that it happened? (If you've seen the film you'll know what I mean). The things I liked about the movie are the death scenes, very well done and gory as hell. But that is pretty much it.

95,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: Leatherface resurfaces.,6,6 January 2013,"This film was not exactly what I expected. I went in knowing that there would be plenty of severed body parts and basically an hour and a half gore-fest. And the case was that there was a reasonably high body count, but there was actually a plausible story amidst the carnage. The film provides a rapid fire back story that was a bit comical as victim after victim walked into a cleaving. This is followed by law enforcement showing up to handle the situation which gets totally out of hand. The film tells a twisted story of the lengths people will go to protect their family and broaches the question of nature versus nurture. When we first encounter Heather (Alexandra Daddario), she is at work and her vocation is a hint into her nature. Since this is a horror flick, the story quickly moves to place the players in harm's way. Typically, horror flicks have nonsense moments and this story was no exception. I released an audible 'wow, really' a number of times as I sat at the edge of my seat watching this story play out, especially the events surrounding the situations with Darryl (Shaun Sipos). After seeing the trailer, I had questioned why these young people would wind up in an isolated home with a chainsaw wielding murderer on the loose and as the story unfolded it made sense. There were many predictable scenarios in this film, one more than others and that being the simple fact that Ryan (Tremaine Neverson) was amongst the soon to be victims. As the onliest brotha* in the group of young people secluded in the woods equation and given the genre of film there was no doubt as to his fate. As far as Trey Songz' acting debut I will say that he wasn't bad. I am glad that he didn't burst into song though, which would have been totally out of place just like the timing and location of the little tryst that he decided to participate in. The flash imagery in dim light to show the eviscerated bodies and the conditions of Jeb's living quarters was appreciated since it is never necessary to see this type of gruesomeness in detail. The 3D premium should stay in your pocket since it was only used on the chainsaw; there was more 3D variety in the preceding trailers. I give this film an amber light.*Note: 'Why'd you have to shoot Jimmie, he was my onliest brotha' dialogue originated in Hollywood Shuffle.",Texas Chainsaw

For the record, Luessenhop really has an eye for a grimy-and-gritty horror approach but good technicality alone isn't nearly enough to justify this as a worthwhile sequel. Instead, Texas CHAINSAW is more of the same horror movie you've come to expect from this already-tired franchise.Picking up where the 1974 movie has left off (along with its original footage to sum up the story), we last seen Sally Hardesty (Marilyn Burns) managed to escape from the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface and hopped on a pickup truck. Shortly after, an angry mob arrived and took justice into their own hands. They ended up shooting the cannibalistic Sawyer clan and burned their farmhouse to the ground. All were presumed dead, except for a baby who belonged to one of the Sawyer women The baby was then snatched up by two of the vigilantes, Gavin and Arlene Miller (David Born and Sue Rock).Years later, the baby is now grown up as a teenage girl named Heather (Alexandra Daddario) who works at a supermarket cutting meat. One day, she is surprised to discover a letter indicating that her grandmother Verna has died and revealed that Gavin and Arlene are actually not her biological parents. Upon knowing the truth, she travels to Texas to claim her inheritance, and tags along her friends Ryan (Trey Songz), Nikki (Tania Raymonde) and Carl (Scott Eastwood) to accompany her for the ride.En route, they pick up a seemingly friendly hitchhiker named Darryl (Shaun Sipos) at the gas station. It doesn't take long before Heather and her gang finally discover the address of the place where it turns out to be Verna's big mansion. Heather decides to stay for a while, while the rest of the gang are planning to have some fun around the mansion. When Heather and her gang drive out to get some groceries, Darryl chooses not to follow. It turns out that Darryl isn't exactly a trustworthy person after all when he takes his chance to loot the mansion for some valuable silverware. Then he discovers a locked room in the wine cellar somewhere at the kitchen. Unfortunately, what lurks inside the locked room is actually Leatherface (Dan Yeager), who is still alive after all and he's been waiting for a chance to escape.After Leatherface brutally slayed Darryl, he proceeds to seek vengeance against the mob previously responsible for his family's death. In the meantime, Heather begins to learn a lot about the ugly truth of her family history.As a strictly genre picture, Luessenhop really gets the job done with plenty of worthwhile tension and especially the way he depicts graphic violence to sickening effect. Alexandra Daddario is quite a sport here, and she is worthy enough to earn a title as a scream queen. Somewhere in between, there's a nice twist in the third act that rewrites the nature of Leatherface's character as well as the subsequent portrayal of Heather.However, Texas CHAINSAW remains a disappointing entry. Luessenhop's overall direction is pedestrian, while the screenplay (written by Adam Marcus, Debra Sullivan and Kirsten Elms) is mostly repetitive. Apart from Daddario's exceptional performance, other cast are instantly forgettable and I must say that Tania Raymonde's character is seriously annoying.",Texas Chainsaw
98,dianerpessler-46164,Great Film With Alexandra Daddario In One of her Finest Roles,10,21 August 2015,"The breathtakingly beautiful and talented Alexandra Daddario sets the motion picture screen ablaze in this fantastic entry in the Texas Chainsaw saga. The excitement and thrills, the terror and horror are absolutely unrelenting in this film and the intensity is almost overwhelming. Daddario has never been more superb than she is in this movie and every scene she is in is virtually, undeniably unforgettable. When she isn't on screen, the film suffers for her absence. The camera obviously loves the woman and the director is wise enough to allow the focus to linger upon her visage. There have been few actresses in cinema history who have entranced movie goers the way Alexandra Daddario has and those who have been touched by her screen presence in the past will find this movie very satisfying indeed.",Texas Chainsaw
99,mdnobles19,Texas Numbskulls 3D,1,5 January 2013,"Texas Chainsaw 3D starts off with clips of the carnage of the original, homemade classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was neat and nostalgic because I've never seen it on the big screen before. After that, the incompetent sequel starts where the original left off, that leads to a gun battle at the original Leatherface's home, which reminded me of the gun battle in the much better film, The Devil's Rejects. I think it was a complete mistake showing those clips and making it a direct sequel to the original and not the remake, which looks brilliant in comparison. The film forced us to have high expectations and compare it to the original.The characters are one dimensional and are the most intellectually challenged individuals in horror movie history, another reason to put a bad name on this ever growing, disappointing genre. The performances didn't help matters either and even the lovely and ever so sexy Alexandra Daddario, who was much better in the superior, slasher/character study Bereavement. Alexandra tries but the horrid script fails her in every way. You don't give a damn about these characters and that's a bad sign in a horror movie because you want to be on the edge of your seat rooting for them to survive the madness. NOT HERE!To quote the old fat tea lady in the trailer of the remake, ""Oh my, my, my, my, my."" End quote; they picked the worst possible director to do a horror movie! Director John Luessenhop seems to know nothing about horror movies or seen one himself. There was no suspense, terror, effective scares or even inventive kills. He had the perfect settings/atmosphere and did nothing remotely chilling or shocking with them, this is a Texas Chainsaw movie after all, but did not feel like one and now I know why they left Massacre out of the title for this failure. The carnival scene could have been a brilliant, stalk and chase scene or even bloody chaos, but it went nowhere fast. Clearly this is a cash cow and they got what they wanted because with early box office reports this could earn up to 25 million! Not earned at all and leaves fans of the original and even the remake, prequel feel very cheated!The makers seem to want to do something very different with the story and had some twists here and there that you don't expect to see from this never ending series. None of it was effective in the slightest, at least under these virgin to horror hands. I rolled my eyes during the revealing and everything was just very amateurish and fan made, but more like I don't know any of the elements on what made the original a classic or the remake and the prequel horror worthy decent made. CLEARLY NOT FAN MADE! I didn't think I would say this, but this is just as bad or worse than Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation! Overall, they got everything wrong! This had the potential to breathe new life and reignite the series into endless possibilities of directions. The film ended up shoving the raw meatiness of the original through a wood chipper! Everyone involved with this film should be very embarrassed and hopefully learn from their mistakes here. Along with The Devil Inside, The Unborn and many more, this is a very disappointing start for horror movies for the New Year. AVOID! DON'T EVEN RENT IT!",Texas Chainsaw

102,trnjamesbond,A Texas Chainsaw Franchise Death,1,12 May 2013,"I just viewed this film yesterday, and all I have to say is, what's the point of anything in this film? The beginning credits start off showing the classic scenes from the original. That's nice and all, but I've seen the original a million times and anyone who is a fan of this franchise knows it fairly well.In the opening scene we see what takes place after Sally escapes from the cannibalistic clan. The scene is set up as a shoot out at the old Sawyer homestead. Which reminds us all of the beginning scenes of Rob Zombie's ""Devils Rejects"". This has all been done before nothing new to see here. The Sawyer home set details were on the money but not gritty enough like the first film. The film grade seemed a little too clean and not shot documentary style like the original.There also seems to be too many people in the house in the original we had Drayton Sawyer, Leatherface, the hitchhiker, and grandpa. Now we see in this instalment some added hillbilly's and a woman that is tagging along side of her a new born child, which ends up getting taken away by one of the Calvary in the shootout gang.Then we move into the future where we see the grown up girl Heather(Alexandra Daddario) she works in the meat department of course, at the local grocery store along side of her bimbo porn star friend.She eventually receives information that she has inherited a plantation that was affiliated with the Sawyer clan which the last name is Carson. Somehow the Carson/Sawyer clan are now the Beverly Hillbilly's.Heather and her friends take a road trip to check out the now abandoned house. They eventually find out that Leatherface is living in the basement and was being taken care of from Heather's dead relative.Firstly the continuity of this story doesn't make any sense Leatherface would be in his 60's by now. Even if you disregard the time line Heather looks like she's in her mid to late 20's and Leatherface in the original was I'm guessing would be in his late 20's early 30's that would still make him at least in his mid to late 50's. So after all these years he's running around like a teenager wielding a chainsaw. In the end Leatherface is now in the care of Heather to carry on the family tradition of apparently being Leatherface's babysitter. What a stupid ending, the writers of this film were total idiots, this could of been a cool story but wasn't. Basically through all the remakes and prequel's this story could of been done well since it was never covered before. The acting in the film was sub par. As far as I'm concerned this version ranks up there with Mathew Matthew McConaughey version back in the early 90's with Renee Zellweger ""Texas Chainsaw:The Next Generation"", which didn't do very well, and had a very limited release, also had a hard to to get financial backing from production companies and I remember it being straight to the video shelves but don't quote me on that.Texas Chainsaw 3D deliver's nothing of value and seemed to be cheaply thrown together with no direction of where they wanted to take the story. It's seems half baked at times, with terrible acting from the surrounding characters Alexandra Daddario's acting was not bad at all, and seemed uncomfortable at times with the script she was given.My final note.Save your time and watch the original, it's a million times better, and has a stellar performance from the entire cast, and was directed very professionally considering the budget they had. At least with the 74 version it had meat on the table no pun intended.",Texas Chainsaw
103,JamesIan2021,Decent Horror,5,16 May 2015,"Although it's not as mad or as terrifying as the original and it's not as gloriously bloody and fun as the 2003 remake, this version of Texas Chainsaw brings back one of the most iconic villains in horror in 3D. This film is filled with the element of surprise and it's filled with jumpy scares in the darkest scenes, but it's also filled with elements of stupidity. What idiot would follow a trail of blood clearly in the wake of Leatherface into a dank underground cellar shouting down a phone? Why would you hide in a dug-out grave whilst being chased by a chainsaw wielding nutter? You'll tut at this movie many times, but you'll also scream many times. The cast are decent, Trey Songz cannot act, but Tania Raymonde and Alexandra Daddario are two excellent female leads that aren't just useless screaming half naked body bags of blood, they are genuinely interesting characters and Thom Barry as town Sheriff Hooper is great, same can't be said for the rest of the cast though who are either severely underdeveloped or just boring. Still, this 2013 remake offers some great gory scenes, plenty of scares and an excellent lead all in useful 3D that livens up the rural surroundings.",Texas Chainsaw
104,DJRMewzique,Utterly ridiculous...and not in a good way.,2,4 January 2013,"I walked into ""Texas Chainsaw"" with my usual tempered expectation when seeing a horror film. We all know that maybe one out of ten releases nowadays is actually good and scary...if we're lucky. And seeing as this one was dumped on the first Friday of the year, it didn't bode well for great expectations from Lionsgate. However, it was distributed by, well, Lionsgate.Alas, the umpteenth sequel to the 1974, although based on a great concept, is a fail.Despite the many follow-up films on the subject, this film is, in a round-about way, a sequel to the 2003 remake of the 1974 original. The original was directed by Tobe Hooper, and Hooper himself helped produce not only this film but the 2003 remake (which inexplicably changed the family name of the murderous family) and the 2006 prequel, but the current film actually uses scenes from the 1974 original (and the original family name of Sawyer) as it's jumping-off point, which gave the film some instant weight for fans of the franchise.However, the weight was lifted real quick.In short, right after the events of the original film, some of the residents of the town of Newt, Texas burn down the house where the original massacre occurred with the entire Sawyer clan inside, but not without one baby surviving the inferno. Said baby grows up never knowing what had happened until she randomly receives word that her long lost grandmother has passed on and left her with an inheritance, resulting in the realization that her abusive parents are not her birth parents. She leaves to check out what she has received, but not without some friends coming along (of course)....and picking up the atypical Texas Chainsaw hitchhiker in the process. Needless to say, the inheritance came with something a little bit unusual, carnage sorta ensues and what could have been a great twist is ruined by the sheer implausibility of the execution of the story.And that is ultimately where the issues with this film lie...in the details. Never mind little stupid things like the fact that the house burning down at the beginning of the film happened on August 19th and somehow, the newspaper which reported the story was also dated August 19th (rather than the 20th). It's the major implausible details like four friends leaving a mansion full of silver to get groceries to be ""cleaned up"" by a hitchhiker they just picked up or the fact that a rotting corpse is randomly found by Heather Miller, the inheritor, and then never once mentioned again. As the story unfolds, it completely falls apart and you risk missing something unimportant because you are too busy rolling your eyes or wondering how a character went from A to B or from caring to not caring. The story just ended up not making any sense.Why RnB artist Trey Songz chose this train wreck to launch his acting career is beyond me, but his character is as unoriginal as his music. Other than Songz, the cast is mainly made up by mediocre, little-known television actors not worth mentioning except with the inclusion Shaun Sipos as the hitchhiker and Scott Eastwood (yes, son of Clint who, until recently, went by the name Scott Reeves) as a police officer, both of whom are absolutely excellent eye candy.So, was I entertained? Well, I wasn't BORED...but this film is definitely a fail in terms of plot and execution and wasn't even so bad it's good. But if you do decide to see it, do not pay extra for 3D if you do not have to but do wait for the end of the credits to get a good grin.",Texas Chainsaw
105,nightwatch4773,Garbage!!!!!,1,22 May 2013,"I loved the original, the Tobe Hooper sequel has grown on me over the years. Leatherface 3 was God awful and the next generation was probably the worst the entire series. Now for the three new ones of the last decade, the 2003 re-boot was okay and I thought the 2007 prequel to the re-boot kicked ass and loved it. It was the second best next to the 1974 classic so I thought this might follow in the same footsteps.......ooooh I was wrong This was GOD AWFUL and it should've went straight to DVD and not to the theatre. What were they thinking, every horror movie cliché out there is in this film. What bothered me the most was that it had 0 suspense 0 scares 0 creation.

106,jaguiar313,really dumb yet still bloody fun horror sequel.,6,4 January 2013,"Is Texas Chainsaw 3D a good movie?... well that depends. If you can't get past a stupid script, cardboard characters and the fact that by the implied time line our plucky heroine (Alexandra Daddario) should be in her 40s not barely in her 20s, then, no. But, if you can sit back and just enjoy a hot babe running around being pursued by a chainsaw wielding maniac who has a knack for carving up her stupid friends, then, yes, it's unintentionally goofy, gory fun. Chainsaw 3D is a direct sequel to the 1974 classic that opens with a vengeful redneck mob laying siege to the house occupied by Leatherface and a lot of other family members that weren't there in the original. A baby is found on the property and we cut to 2012 (the date is confirmed on a tombstone as September 2012) where Heather (Daddario), has magically only grown up to be 20 something and is an amazingly hot butcher at a supermarket. She soon gets word that her grandmother (original Chainsaw heroine Marilyn Burns), that she didn't know she had, has died and left her a house in Texas. Whoa! Adopted and now rich! Heather goes down to the house with some generic stereotype friends who seem handpicked to be murdered which is smart because there just happens to be another family member living hidden in the house like Bad Ronald (70s TV movie reference. Google it.) and he just happens to like world peace, romantic evenings, chainsaws and wearing peoples faces. Before you can say,gratuitous ass close-up, Leatherface emerges from hiding and starts hacking up everyone he can find. Throw in some sleazy rednecks, some redneck cops (including Scott Eastwood, Clint's son) and it's a redneck smörgåsbord...literally as the body parts fly fast and furious. Sure, director John Luessenhop doesn't really generate much suspense or scares from the incredibly dumb script but, Chainsaw 3D reminded me of some of the lower tier 80s slasher flicks that were entertaining despite and because of how bad they were. There are numerous references to the original flick and I just had fun watching a chubby, balding Leatherface carving up all the unlikable characters when not chasing his hot cousin around trying to kill her. Alexandra Daddario was a fine (and I mean FINE) and feisty heroine and I liked her character's twist once she finds out who she really is and that she now has to buy her chainsaw wielding cousin a Christmas Card every year... if he lets her live. Yes, Chainsaw 3D is a very dumb and silly horror flick but, it also is blood drenched fun if you go in not expecting much and stop comparing it to the movie it's trying to honor. And despite how bad it's written, the film is trying to honor it's roots and we get some fun cameos to prove it and when it's all said and done it can be a good time if you just sit back and enjoy watching hot chicks in peril and sleazy rednecks meeting chainsaw justice. A few beers before the show wouldn't hurt... if fact it might be a good idea.",Texas Chainsaw
107,fathersonholygore,It could have been a contender,3,2 May 2013,"I love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in general. The first time I saw the original, I was absolutely disgusted, shocked, terrified. I loved the sequel with Dennis Hopper and Bill Moseley (a treat to see the latter back in action on this film), and there are even parts of the third outing I enjoyed; later, the remake was highly enjoyable, and I particularly liked the prequel, Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. However, Texas Chainsaw (2013) has proved to be ultimately disappointing for several reasons.One thing I did enjoy is a different twist on what happened to the Sawyers originally; I think if they hadn't added SO many new Sawyers, it would have played out a little better, as it suddenly seemed there was an army of them, which is fine to change the story, but it seemed there were just too many of them. I like how they attempted turning Leatherface into a sort of horror anti-hero by 'avenging' his family, but that being said it's easier to draw sympathy for a criminal character in other films (Heat, Goodfellas, et cetera) than a skin wearing cannibal in a horror film. What I like stops there though. The kills were solid, but the story is generally soggy. I agree with people arguing about Heather's age; if they excluded some of the rap music being listened to, and the scene involving an extended use of Face Time on iPhones, it might have been easy to say, ""Sure- this takes places some time in the middle-to- late 90s"", but these anachronisms make it tough to ignore. Furthermore, I found it ridiculous that all of a sudden Heather becomes a sort of wanted woman after Leatherface begins wreaking havoc, and they're determined to get her. I understand she's technically a Sawyer, but it seemed ridiculous that they made it a point to try and capture her. I mean, why were they doing that? What was the purpose? It never seemed to have a legitimate reason for being part of the plot, and it made me frustrated. I know people might say it was a way to further Heather's character in the direction of hating the people in that town because of what they did to her family, and it was just a continuation of that, but it was too much, it felt ridiculous. It seemed like all of a sudden the police were more concerned with finding a girl who is no threat to them whatsoever, and conveniently forgot there was a skin wearing, chainsaw wielding, cannibalistic killer on the loose.My only gratification was that Leatherface gave the stupid townsfolk what they deserved. If the mayor and his police weren't so pigheaded and perpetually stupid, I might have been on their side especially near the end, but I was simply ready to watch the whole town aside from the sheriff be chopped into tiny little bits. The ending itself was just too ridiculous, and any sympathy I felt for Sheriff Hooper (well named certainly) dissolved with his final decision regarding the town mayor and Leatherface. I give this 4 stars, but I wish I could give it more because I really do love the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise. This just did not live up to my expectations in any way.Highlights: some of the kills were excellent, the opening scene was fun, and even if Bill Moseley was only on screen for 5 minutes or less, I still love seeing him act any chance I get.",Texas Chainsaw

113,Milo-Jeeder,"This film is wrong in so many ways, yet I don't completely hate it.",5,21 November 2013,"The reason why I do not hate this film is mostly because it's entertaining and lots of fun. Honestly, it's the seventh installment in the series, so one can only expect a very small share of quality horror by now. Seriously, how many times can a film be recycled, rebooted, remade, retold, prequel-ed or whatever? ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" has three official sequels and those were mostly intended as reboots, then there was the official remake, which was rather good, and then the prequel to the remake. In this case, ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"" was intended as a sequel that takes up right after the first film directed by Tobe Hooper in 1974, and that's what I like about this film. However, how seriously can I take a horror film that has ""3D"" on the title? The original film by Tobe Hooper is considered a masterpiece to this day because it was a perfectly done horror film with almost no budget and most of all, simplicity. There were no superb special effects, no massive amounts of gore and brutal as it was, Tobe Hooper managed to keep it nice and simple. Well, in ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"", the film opens with a scene that is supposed to take place right after the events of the first film. In this scene, we find out what happens to Leatherface and his family of sadistic maniacs, when the police arrive. I have to say, they did a very good job with this, because the house looks exactly like the one in the original film and the photography looks very much like in the original film directed by Hooper. The problem is, right after this wonderful opening scene, everything goes to hell and that's not a compliment.First of all, the characters are very poorly written and their actions make no sense most of the times, including the main character. Now, I know this is a slasher film and character development is not exactly what slasher films are all about, but there's no reason to make them so weak and absurd! It would be forgivable if the lack of sensitivity was the director's way of filmmaking or if it added something to a surreal kind of story-telling, but in this case, it's just plain bad writing. I mean, most of the things that the characters do just cannot be explained by anyone's logic. The main character, for example, whose name is Heather, discovers almost by the end of the film, that she is related to the blood-hungry maniacs from the original film. Now, one would normally expect her to be shocked and escape from this, but no, young Heather actually decides to join her cannibalistic cousin Jeb (Leatherface), because I don't know why! Blood is thicker than water and the writers were lazy, I guess. Then, there's a huge chronological inconsistency that basically ruins the entire film, at least for me and it makes me take the film less seriously. The main character, who was supposedly born in 1974, appears in this film, which takes place in 2012, as 26-year old girl! I seriously can't understand how they could have failed to notice this. I mean, if they wanted to choose a younger cast because they thought it would be more appealing to the audience, they should have set the story in the mid or late 90s, but not this! I understand that being a slasher film, the cast is supposed to be attractive (though I disagree with this rule), but there are a lot of attractive actresses and actors in their late 30s or early 40s, there was no need to cast people in their early or mid 20s to make this appealing to the young audience.Another thing that bothers me a great deal, are the cheesy dialogs and lines in this film. Seriously, I know this is not supposed to be Shakespearean, but the dialogs are cringe-worthy most of the times. Everything sounds artificial and cheap, like a bad TV movie or a dated soap opera. Things that make the film work: It's fun! Seriously, it's really a watchable movie for the most part and I can't say that I'm never going to see it again, because I probably will. This is one of those films that, even if they are very flawed, one can somehow ignore the errors and watch them again, just because they're very entertaining and fun. Another thing I liked about this film: Even if it was poorly executed, the idea behind it was good. I love the fact that we get to know more about the family's back story and even about a wealthy relative who cares for the chainsaw killer. It was nice to see the characters change scenario for once. A pleasant surprise was also seeing Marilyn Burns, who played the original final girl in the 1974 film, in a different character. Actually, Marilyn Burns didn't play a victim anymore, but instead, one of Leatherface's relatives, which is a good wink to the audience, I guess.Final verdict: The movie was poorly done and it's mostly insulting to the fans, but it's fun and enjoyable. I wish the writers would have been a little bit more attentive to certain crucial details and more serious with the dialogs. This film had all the potential in the world to be a great sequel.",Texas Chainsaw

Realizing my mistake, I went ahead to see what this movie had to offer. It starts off with a rehash of scenes from the mid 70s movie that show all the carnage at the very end.Guess what? This sequel tries to make some cockamamie story about how that blonde girl who got away in the pickup truck called the cops on the people in the Chainsaw House and what happened after that. THEN, once that gets resolved within five minutes, the action jumps ahead to the present day, 2012.I'll spare you any more details because honestly, this movie isn't worth the time or effort. There is a whole new troupe of attractive young people who get caught in the clutches of a 21st century chainsaw killer. It's so badly directed and acted it would almost be laughable if it weren't so obvious they were trying to make a serious movie.Think of this in the same way as the effect that ""Batman and Robin"" had on the Batman franchise before Christopher Nolan rebooted it 10 years later.

115,jadediamond,A Series of Stupid Acts,1,22 September 2019,"This is why the horror movie genre is going downhill. Every horror cliche was in this movie besides nudity and the cliche sex scene which I'm thankful for. The only good thing about this movie was the star Alexandra Anna Daddario doing her best in a bad movie. She didn't overact. She did her job and collected her check.Yes, a small portion of horror fans love the sex, violence, and gore. But many want smart horror in compelling storylines where the characters don't have to constantly make stupid decisions in order for the movie to continue. Which is why movies like Get Out and Cloverfield Lane stand out, because the protagonist has to use their brains to get out of a bad situation. This movie had the hitchhiker turning out to be a thief. The cheating boyfriend sleeping with his girlfriend's promicious best friend in her daisy duke shorts. Tripping down the stairs to make it easier for the villian to be able to follow after the final girl. One character trying to run through an iron gate when all he had to do was wait until it opened and they could have eacaped. Instead of the lawyer meeting her at the bar, they could have had the same conversation in his car on the way out of town. The no good mayor and the other rednecks making a already handled situation worse which led to the plot of this movie. The twist of a character unshockingly turning bad. A black sheriff who has no control over the white men in town. So his threats fall idle. And a cop shooting one in the victims in surprise which I guess would be funny to a Rob Zombie fan. The violence was anticlimactic. The villian would snatch a victim but it cuts off from the actual torture. For horror fans who like gore, the death scene is usually their favorite parts of a horror film.The few positives about this film were the lead actress of course, the guy who played the villian did his job, the cinematography was nice, the death scenes were bloody, and the scene in the interrogation room when the lead actress is looking through the evidence and the scene at the carnival were a nice change especially the throwing of the chainsaw. The movie had potential if those behind making this movie were brave enough to stop making a safe movie and stepped outside the box. Making the characters smarter instead of having them commit dumb acts to keep the movie going. And better death scenes would also been an improvement.

On one hand they want to make lots of profitable movies out of it, but storywise they just aren't creative enough or risky enough to come up with a sustainable continuing story. All of the TCM movies since the first one, with the sole exception of the TCM part 2, have basically just been remakes of the first. Even the prequel THE BEGINNING still followed the plot structure of all of the others.The producers for TCM 3D were fortunately able to devise a story that would continue that of the first film, rather than just repeat it. By showing the first film's aftermath they answer some questions and set the stage for new developments.Alexandra Daddario as Heather is the film's MVP. She is better than we could hope for for a horror heroine: sweet, intelligent, sexy, vulnerable, strong, and tough. She makes the whole movie work.She is destined for big things, but I wouldn't mind seeing her come back for another TCM in the meantime.",Texas Chainsaw
118,cornflakeboy20,A good typical slasher that takes a nosedive,4,26 May 2013,"This is only the second of the TCM series I have watched, the first being the original film, which this is a purported sequel to. It picks up where the original leaves off with a lynch mob killing the family (who all look fairly normal) and the baby being unofficially adopted by one of the mob. Cut to the baby who knows how many years later (since others have pointed out that TCM took place in '73 and the movie is set in modern times) and she has inherited her somehow wealthy Grandma's estate.So, when we pick up, the now buxom twenty or forty something takes three assorted friends to the estate of her Grandmother (Leatherface's Great Aunt, I believe). And, as in the original, they pick up a no good hitchhiker. We are not far into the gang enjoying the estate and getting up to typical horror film hijinks interspersed with creepiness, before it turns out that Leatherface has been locked up in the basement these 40 - or 20 - years, and is eager to resume killing. Where the grandmother got her money and why she did help her inbred, impoverished relatives is another detail the film leaves out. Our heroin's origins from inbred hillbillies and formative years raised by losers also have not prevented her from being well-spoken, popular and attractive.Our heroine discovers the town's corruption and complicity in her family's death, and totally forgiving the fact that Leatherface has killed all her friends, she returns him to the basement, where presumably the next movie will pick up as a sitcom of the mentally challenged sociopath and the buxom modern girl looking for love. Hell, after the end credits they get a jump on the comedy series by having her evil adoptive parents show up and presumably be horribly yet justifiably butchered.Why couldn't this just have been a clichéd slasher with a beginning, middle and end? Why could she not have sympathized with Leatherface slightly but still have put him out like Lenny in Of Mice and Men?Nothing, not the character motivations, nor the timeline, nor the story structure makes any sense. Given that it looks like there was money behind this movie, and some talent, and some cooperation of the original cast, it really was just a bad story that ruined it. Apparently some movies would be better by being more formulaic.",Texas Chainsaw
119,VenturousArtist,"""This chainsaw is very rusty and broken.""",1,8 May 2014,"As any other franchise, there will come a point where the original or newest writers will desire a sequel, prequel, or 'reboot'. It happened since the beginning of that exact thought and has never ended. These days, the general audience consumes these thoughts as if there's not one fatal flaw with it...But unfortunately, this 'sequel' partakes every flaw you could never imagine all into one.This Texas Chainsaw sequel is set directly after the very first installment which was released in the year 1974. Despite the bizarre idea of setting the sequel many years after the intertwining storyline, there's a lot of expectations original fans will have if they've stayed this long with the series. For most of us, as some hope, they've been gradually disappointed with many further installments as they have failed to stay logical and fair enough to top the original if they're not just as good.While the film pays homage to the entire series and at least attempted to give the viewers something slightly new with the styled writing and setting, it doesn't stray away from giving all it has to offer a sense of unoriginality and boredom. Everything is a giant illogical and unintentionally humorous contradicting disaster that puts further shame into this franchise. While the remake and prequel of the original film has more muscle and terror, this sequel expresses itself as the loathsome most people would fight their heads with a steel hammer to forget. Texas Chainsaw isn't strong enough to cut through bone because this chainsaw is very rusty and broken.",Texas Chainsaw
120,the_bluesman,"""Do your thing, cuz!""",2,15 July 2016,"Even on second viewing three and a half years later, the above line is still one of the most cringe-worthy I have ever heard.I rated 'Texas Chainsaw' 2/10 back in January 2013 and I stand by my rating after watching it a second time. Even though it looks good, has a creepy atmosphere (at least in and around grandma's house) and some nice splatter scenes to offer plus a beautiful lead actress (Alexandra Daddario) going for it, this movie is an absolute mess.First off, a real problem with 'Texas Chainsaw' is the fact that it takes place in the present but still is supposed to be a direct sequel to the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (1974). We know that the events in the first movie took place in 1973 and Heather was a little baby at that time. 'Texas Chainsaw' supposedly takes place in October of 2012 (grandma's day of death is September 29, 2012 according to her tombstone). That would make Heather 39 but she looks to be in her early twenties at the most. We see a number of townspeople and the sheriff in the scenes that take place in 1973 and they don't look much older later on in the present-day scenes, let alone 40 years older.So when you watch the movie and do the math, you probably come to the conclusion that the movie must be taking place in 1993 or something. Heather's boyfriend drives an old Volkswagen bus and there are no cellphones or computers to be seen. The early '90s scenario seems plausible for about half of the movie until one of the sheriff's guys pulls out an iPhone and live streams his search of grandma's house. Now the timeline is completely ruined and the people who made 'Texas Chainsaw' knew it.When you closely observe the movie, you will notice a few times when we see the date ""August 19"" but the year ""1973"" is not shown on purpose. One time we see the date on an old newspaper but the year is smudged out. Another time we see it on a tombstone but the year is obscured by grass. Very curious indeed. There is however one time where the complete date ""08/18/1973"" can be seen on a police report. That was probably overlooked. All this is distracting and it makes you wonder but I wouldn't consider it a major flaw if the movie was otherwise good. Nevertheless, it would have been a much better idea to have the movie take place in the early '90s to not mess up the continuity.Another problem with 'Texas Chainsaw' are Heather's friends, who must be some of the most generic supporting characters ever. That's probably why they are killed off early on. The evil town people are not much better. The acting is mediocre at best but that is a relatively minor issue compared to the horrendous script with its thin and ludicrous plot.It's incredible how anyone would approve a script that constitutes Leatherface's murderous family as victims of the bad townspeople. It is completely ridiculous that Leatherface, a notorious mindless murder machine, in this installment of the series is depicted as a poor backward guy who is just out for a little revenge on the people who did him and his family wrong years ago. Sure, he kills mostly just innocent people on his way to revenge, but he doesn't know any better, right? Insanity! Leatherface always was a cold-blooded killer, nothing else. He didn't have an agenda in the previous movies. He just killed. Period.'Texas Chainsaw' tries to depict Leatherface as a kind of victim and fails badly at it. The fact that Heather bonds with cousin Leatherface the way it is shown here after he just chopped up all of her friends doesn't make sense at all. She actually begs the sheriff not to shoot poor Leatherface and what's even more unbelievable is that he complies. Yes, the sheriff indeed lets Leatherface go after he rampaged at the town fair, brutally murdered a couple of innocent people and gruesomely cut up one of the sheriff's own men.Not enough lunacy? The sheriff just tells Heather and Leatherface to clean up the mess and walks away from the crime scene. What gives?! Nobody in their right mind would act like Heather and the sheriff do here. I tell you, nobody. Such a behavior is far from believable and almost an insult to anyone's intelligence. Maybe a plot as ridiculous as this would work if it was done as a horror comedy, but 'Texas Chainsaw' is dead serious and that makes it all the more bizarre.The only scene that is really good is a very short one that comes after the closing credits: Heather's foster parents ring at her door talking about how much they love her now that she has money and then Leatherface comes out of the house swinging his chainsaw. Sure, it's a pretty stupid idea that Heather would actually let Leatherface kill off the people that raised her for many years even after finding out what they did, but the tongue-in-cheek way it is done in this short scene makes it really funny. Sadly, there is nothing of this funniness in the actual movie. I reckon the movie could have been much better if it was done in that over-the-top style similar to 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2' (1986).'Texas Chainsaw' needs the audience to take a plot seriously that just can't be taken seriously and that is the big problem. It doesn't work. I'm sure most people have a facepalm-feeling at the end of the movie. I certainly would be surprised if you don't cringe when you hear ""Do your thing, cuz!""",Texas Chainsaw
121,watcher101,Possibly the worst character development in history,4,13 November 2020,"Most of the movie was just ok, though nowhere near it's predecessors. However, the development of Heather's character was so ridiculous that you can't buy it no matter how much you stretch you suspension of disbelief. After watching Leatherface brutally murder her friends and boyfriend, and then chase her all around with a chainsaw and try to kill her, she learns that the Sawyer family was a clan of murderers and cannibals who have been sadistically killing people for years, if not generations, but that they were wiped out in a shootout with the cops after they resisted arrest. However, the literal second she finds out she's Leatherface's cousin, she immediately and without hesitation accepts herself as a Sawyer, instantly forgives Leatherface for everything he did (including the murder of her friends and boyfriend) and seeks to protect him and cover up his murders while becoming perfectly ok with everything the Sawyer family did. What more, she even declares that the cops that killed the Sawyers in the shootout are the real murderers. That would be like you finding out you're related to the Manson family and immediately becoming ok with everything they did and trying to defend them while claiming that those that brought them in were the ones in the wrong. It's so unbelievable it's ridiculous. What more, she even joins in on Leatherface's murderous ways, including luring in and allowing him to murder her adoptive parents, who admittedly, she did not have a good relationship with, but still, and is perfectly happy to be Leatherface's guardian and protector while hiding and cleaning up his murders. It's so outrageous and stupid that it's laughable.",Texas Chainsaw
122,thefilmdiscussion,'Texas Chainsaw 3D' is a ridiculous hack,2,14 January 2013,"John Luessenhop's ""sequel"" to Tobe Hooper's nerve-crushing original from 1974 is a confused, sloppy, toothless mess that is even worse than that pathetic remake from 2003. That the trailers and promotionals offered what looked like a fresh and scary re-imagining makes this an even more painful letdown.The film begins with horribly edited cuts of Hooper's original, butchering some of the more famous shots that transcend the genre. The new film then begins seconds after the first left off, with swarms of Texas cops surrounding the Sawyer house, demanding they give themselves up. But an angry mob of townspeople overrules the policemen and burns the house to the ground. It's assumed that everyone dies. But the mentally handicapped ""Leatherface"" survives in the basement, and his cousin, as an infant, is secretly rescued by a family in the mob.Then we jump forward a confusing amount of years. Confusing because the rescued baby is now a young woman, but certainly no older than twenty- six. Ambiguous clothing, locales and vehicles offer more confusion than homage or clarity, but eventually we find out that it is, indeed, 2012. Now wait, an infant in 1974 would be around thirty eight years old, right? Alexandra Daddario does NOT play a thirty-eight year-old. So why not set the film in an earlier time period? Beats me. This is the first of the film's many problems, and its utter blatantness is so baffling one wonders what the script supervisors and continuity people were doing on set.The film hits its high point when the girl travels to Texas with her friends to check out a mansion she inherited from her unknown grandmother. When the curious young adults get a little too curious and discover a face-wearing, chainsaw-wielding psycho in the basement, the scares are intense and powerful. But poor directorial choices lead the segment to end too quickly, missing some profound opportunities both in storytelling and camera-work.The story goes horribly south at this point, as the girl learns of her heritage and becomes empathetic with her long-lost cousin, Leatherface, apparently forgetting that he's butchered all of her friends for barbecue meat. Before the horrid film reaches its miserable and sequel- forcing ending, we witness a ridiculous chainsaw sword fight and have completely lost the ability to be terrified by the film's monster. When (spoiler) the girl throws Leatherface his chainsaw and says ""Do your thing, cuz"", you might just vomit in your mouth a little bit. Most frustratingly of all is a plot device that would have stopped everything from happening, but without a convincing reason for why it didn't do just that.And yes, filming has started on the sequel.

123,Loving_Silence,Blatantly obvious it was made just for the money.,1,3 January 2013,"Texas Chainsaw 3D (2013) is a sequel to the original classic ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" (1974) even though there has been other sequels, reboots, and a prequel, mind you. So to call this a sequel would mean to forget the other 5 films that were made way before this. Oh well, I've seen more offensively manipulative marketing before.So was the movie good? Of course not, it couldn't even surpass my ridiculously low expectations. The movie is completely unoriginal and filled with more clichés than there are craters on the moon. The plot of the film has been done to death in the horror genre. A group of young hot teenagers go out and encounter a psychotic killer. You already know what's going to happen, who's going to get killed, etc. The movie is completely devoid of suspense and any true scares because it is completely predictable from start to finish. Any movie that relies on cheap jump is a big NO-NO for me, but even those are utterly predictable in the film.The acting is pretty standard to that of other horror movies, completely and totally unremarkable. Don't even plan on watching the film on 3D because it adds nothing to the film and is a complete waste of money. The movie made no attempt at trying to be original and actually try to genuinely scare me. At the end of the day, the movie had no reason to exist at all, it rehashes the same boring plot lines of countless previous horror movies. Why did they make this movie, there are 5 other sequels (albeit kind of bad) that came before. The answer is because all that Liongate cares about is to make money and that's it, I don't hate them for it, but next time try not to make it so obvious.",Texas Chainsaw
124,zdflanders,"""Do your thing coz""",1,15 January 2021,"^ Probably the most cringe line used in the entire franchise. This movie uses the most basic horror formula to come up with something unworthy of the already deteriorating series. The characters are just awful. Heather (our lead scream queen) went through the dumbest character arch I've ever seen. She gets taken from the Sawyer cannibal family and given to a stereotypical redneck family yet somehow she turns out like some college kid from the north. She has no accent, dresses like one of the edgy Tim Burton chicks we all saw at high school, and gets upset over literally everything. Her character arch is hating her fake redneck family, hating her psychotic cannibal family, and then loving her psychotic cannibal family for basically no reason.All of the lead characters come straight from the 80's slasher films. Meaning we have our lead protagonist Heather (sensible yet dresses scantily and suspicious of everyone while unprovoked), Ryan (her typical jock looking boyfriend who cheats on her), Nikki (her friend that cheats with Ryan and can somehow make her cashier work uniform seem clad), and Kenny (Nikki's very northern seeming boyfriend who basically does nothing)
Yes this is exactly the same cast as every slasher film from the 80s.And this is basically every character. This movie demonizes the crap out of southern people. Basically anyone with a southern accent is a villain and anyone who sounds northern is good. It's hilarious because everyone comes from the same exact area. The group of rednecks at the beginning reminds me of the townspeople in Halloween. They would basically just go wherever the murderer was presumed to be and then shoot up the place/burn it down without provocation. It just basically makes this unwatchable to anyone in a southern state because of its offensive portrayal. I come from the north and I've been here my entire life but I still don't agree with this stereotype.",Texas Chainsaw

127,Jwdjrs,Favorite of the franchise,9,11 January 2014,"Texas Chainsaw is a direct sequel to the 1974 original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Heather and Jedidiah are the only Sawyers that survived an attack, from a man named Burt and his friends. Heather was just a baby then, and when she grows up, she inherits a house from a recently passed away ancestor. She travels to the house down in Texas, with her friends. But she has no idea that her cousin Jedidiah Sawyer lives down in the basement. Jedidiah is immediately confused when several people (that he's never seen before) enter the house. But keep in mind that Jedidiah is extremely mentally retarded, and is a murderous, chainsaw-wielding freak that knows no better. He decides that he needs to get rid of the people that are invading his home. So he hunts them down one by one. Jedidiah has no idea that one of the people that he is hunting is his own cousin. She doesn't know that he is her cousin, either. So when Jedidiah is chasing Heather around with a chainsaw, she thinks it's just some crazed maniac who popped up out of nowhere. After surviving Jedidiah's attack, she discovers, by looking at some photos, that the now mayor of the town, Burt, is the man that killed her family. She is later kidnapped by Burt's son and taken to a warehouse (and is tied up with rope, hanging from the ceiling) where Jedidiah eventually finds her. He's about to slash Heather up into bits with his chainsaw, until he notices a little scar on her chest. The scar is shaped like an S. Before Heather's family was killed by Burt and his friends, Heather's mother held her so tight that her mother's necklace (in the shape of an S) left a mark on Heather.Jedidiah immediately cuts the rope with his chainsaw to set her free. But Burt arrives at the warehouse right after Jedidiah rescues Heather. Heather is running away from the barn when she hears Burt beating Jedidiah up. She goes back and gets Burt off of him. She then throws Jedidiah his chainsaw. Time to kill Burt! Jedidiah slashes both of Burt's Achilles, causing Burt to fall down and unable to stand. Jedidiah forces Burt into a powered meat grinder which gobbles up Burt. Afterwards Jedidiah and Heather return home to stay.My thoughts on the movie: extremely fun and highly entertaining with interesting plot and cool plot twist. My only problems with the movie was the terrible CGI blood when Burt slips into the meat grinder, and when Heather throws Jedidiah the chainsaw, she says, ""Do your thing, cuz!"" If you are a horror fan or Texas Chainsaw Massacre fan, I highly recommend this movie. Check it out!",Texas Chainsaw
128,Darkweasel,"The letter, Heather. Read it.",3,15 September 2014,"The story goes that on August 18th 1973 a group of teenagers were killed by a family of four cannibalistic psychopaths. The last surviving member of the group, a screamy little creature called Sally Hardesty, made one last, desperate bid for freedom through a closed window the following morning, and after being chased by one of the family wielding a chainsaw, finally made her escape in the back of a pick-up truck.And that's where The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ended.Now, completely ignoring the three existing sequels (and it's two recent prequels), we open with the local Sheriff rushing to the farmhouse from where Sally had escaped, to confront and arrest the family of people-eating nutters. Except that now, the family has suddenly and inexplicably increased in size by another four members. And includes a baby.Er... what?So, while the local townsfolk (who seem to be aware of the mental health of the family but were happy to let them go about their business until they killed a handful of complete strangers) shoot the psychos and burn down the farmhouse, two of them kidnap the baby, kill its mother, and run off to play happy families.Okay, so that's at least a little more believable. Sort of.The film then cuts to to the present day. Now remember - it's 2012 and the farmhouse was burnt to the ground in 1973. That's a space of 39 years for those of you who can't be bothered to work it out. And I include the film-makers in that. Why? Because our leading lady, the baby from 1973, is now apparently only in her mid-twenties. A raven-haired, tightly toned lovely called Heather, with nary a grey hair nor hint of a wrinkle in sight. Upon hearing she has inherited a mansion from her grandmother, her ""parents"" tell her that she was actually ""adopted"" and she runs off crying to South Texas to claim her big house, taking her best friend and her boyfriend with her.After completely and not at all predictably picking up a hitchhiker along the way, Heather meets the family lawyer at the entrance to her new estate who hands her the keys and a letter. He then very carefully proceeds to tell her (twice in fact) to READ. THE. LETTER. Remember, Heather. READ THE LETTER.She doesn't read the letter.She does, however, read a newspaper detailing the events of the 18th/19th of August 1973. But somehow the newspaper is also (and very clearly) dated the 19th. That's quite some local paper they have there. They must also have the fountain of youth there because, apart from having no hair, the sheriff looks identical to how he did in 1973, as does the chap who instigates the burning of the farmhouse, and, well, everybody who was involved with the story back then. That's not even mentioning Leatherface himself, who at the time was presumably in his late teens/early twenties, making him around 60 years old now, yet still fully capable of chasing kids and camper vans while waving a chainsaw about.So, anyway, the hitchhiker turns out to be a thief, the boyfriend turns out to be a cheat, and the best friend turns out to be the girl with whom her boyfriend cheated. Can anybody spell DEAD?After a friendly game of hide, seek, and chainsaw, and a couple of chases (one of which features a bizarre sort of passing of the torch from the Saw franchise to this new one as a robed character with a pigs head comes face to face with Leatherface), the film eventually disintegrates into a series of increasingly unlikely events (can someone show me where I can buy one of those brilliant mobile phones that streams live HD footage directly to police computers?), before finally ending with Leatherface somehow becoming some sort of vigilante hero type. As a film in its own right, and forgetting all of the baggage of the original and its sequels, it's a fairly mundane, but ultimately harmless affair. However, as a direct sequel to one of the most influential horror films of the 20th Century, it's nothing short of an abomination. Yet it somehow still manages to be better than the one with Renée Zellweger.Why didn't you just read the f**king letter, Heather?",Texas Chainsaw
129,angelakenney-52982,Decent Script Ruined By Major Plot Holes,7,4 February 2020,"I was told to stay away from this movie. I mean, stay far away from this movie. At the time it was released, I was already experiencing 3D and Texas Chainsaw fatigue, so it was pretty easy for me to stay away from it and not give it a second thought. Curiosity got the better of me last night and I gave this one and shot and, folks, I have to say that I kind of enjoyed it.Is it a great movie? No, but it's reasonably well acted and there are some decent scares and moments of suspense. It gets progressively sillier the further along it goes, but it's easy to take seriously for the first half and Leatherface's first appearance genuinely jolted me.The main issue here is the wonky timeline. A baby is born in 1973, around the events of the original movie, and we flash forward to 2012 and this baby is now in her 20's, which makes absolutely no sense. How did no one think this through? Sure, it'd make more sense for a 20-something to go on a rollicking road trip with her party-loving friends than someone about to clear 40, but c'mon. It makes no sense. Also, two characters we meet in the prologue seem to haven't aged a day in almost 40 years?Oddly enough, it's not the script or acting that disappoints in this movie, but the casting. How hard would it have been to get the ages right? Was the studio that insistent on casting a group of pretty, 20-somethings that they threw all logic out the window?

I did not read any of the reviews. I feel viewers under-appreciated the work. The director, John Luessenhop, does not have a slew of credits Texas attached to his name, however, I thought in trying to keep with the original Chain Saw film, he pulled off a worthy sequel. There were more of these films than I originally thought. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, 1974 (Marilyn Burns) The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2, 1986 (Dennis Hopper) The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Next Generation, 1995 (Renee Zellweger) Leatherface: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre III, 2003 (Kate Hodge) The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Remake), 2003 (Jessica Biel) The Texas Chain Saw Massacre: The Beginning, 2007 (Jordana Brewster) The Texas Chain Saw, 2013 (Alexandra Daddario)Some big names tied to the franchise, no doubt. Anyway . . .The movie picks up where the original 1974 movie ends. Leatherface let Marilyn Burns escape the farmhouse. He returns as Sheriff Hooper arrives to investigate. The Sawyer family is holed up inside, protecting the simple-minded family member mostly responsible for the mass killing spree that turned their basement into an animal-like slaughterhouse.Like any good redneck town, an angry mob of vigilante civilians pull up. Pickup trucks and shotguns. Unable to control the mob alone, Hooper is forced to watch the events spiral out of control. A shootout ensues and the farmhouse is torched. Everyone except an infant survives. Present time: Heather Miller (portrayed by Alexandra Daddario) receives word that a grandmother she didn't know existed has passed away. In the will, Miller inherits a huge house in Texas. She and her boyfriend Ryan (Trey Songz), Nikki (Tanya Raymonde), Darryl (Shaun Sipos), and a hitchhiker decide to stay the night in the house.Things fall apart fast from there. A chain saw wielding killer is on the loose, the five people in the house are not safe, but neither are the people of the town. Burt Hartman (Paul Rae), didn't just lead the mob to murder years and years ago -- he is now the Mayor. He will go to any lengths to protect the town, and the people in it. Even if that means doing unthinkable things to protect and keep buried the sins of the past.Miller, learning that she is actually a Sawyer, is in a desperate race to assemble the puzzle pieces of her new found heritage, while fighting to keep herself and her friends alive. Can she succeed at uncovering and exposing truths that have been hidden for so long? Or will she loose herself, and her life, trying?Quite sexy midriffs and long legs decorate the screen, but no nudity. There is some bad language. A ton of gruesome and detailed violence. Horrific mutilation scenes. All on par for a classic Chain Saw film.Pretty good acting, believable dialogue and suspense kept me from Facebooking and Tweeting. Texas Chain Saw is a mix of slasher film coupled with a suspense/mystery. It was both intense and scary. I enjoyed the actual story. The only thing I hope -- no -- the only thing I pray, is that this is it. This is the last one. But I've prayed that prayer before. It rarely comes true. Still, I've enjoyed all but one in the series of Chain Saw movies (Renee Zellweger, sorry).

Today's society is so desensitised to violent images that a film like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, made in 1974 and banned for being so terrifying, just appears funny nowadays. So the logical thing to do is make horror films which are so bad they are comedies, hilarious comedies, which ironically mock horror films of the past. Well, at least I think that's what the makers of Texas Chainsaw 3D have done....Continuing from the old 1974 version, the plot is really original and groundbreaking. I lie. The plot is based on the usual ''bunch of teenagers find themselves in abandoned house, where mad killer finds them and kills them one by one whilst each teenager is in state of nudity'' story, and includes R&B singer Trey Songz in the cast (his character spends most of the film listening to Trey Songz songs as if they were the greatest pieces of music ever created). The film then attempts to become slightly deep by having a link to family run through the film, and we find ourselves being encouraged to cheer for ''Leatherface'', (the psychotic chainsaw-wielding maniac who wears human faces as a mask), as he tries to protect his cousin from police officers who justifiably want her out the way (seeing as her family is full of psychotic killers). A ridiculous ending is made all the worse with a hint that there could be a sequel on the horizon. Oh yes, the 3D is virtually non-existent, it would probably be a better film if you took the glasses off and just watched a blurry film whilst making up your own, logical plot.3/10- The 3 points come solely from the script, which unintentionally provides so many laughs, due to being so awfully bad.",Texas Chainsaw

134,slasherstudios,Chainsaw Cuts but Needs a Sharpened Script,6,5 January 2013,"Before I begin this review, let me ask you a question. When was the last time you saw a horror movie released to theaters in the month of January that actually turned out to be good? The Devil Inside? White Noise? The Unborn? Well, if you answered any of those films, you and I have a serious difference of opinion on the word ""good."" The one exception I will maybe give you is My Blood Valentine 3D. What is my point here? There is a reason why studios release horror films in January, 9 times out of 10 they are too awful to be released on the movie going public any other time of year. So, when today's film, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D, was moved from October 2012 to January 2013, all expectations for this film dropped. Did Lions gate realize they had a clunker on their hands or were they just afraid of the juggernaut known as Paranormal Activity? With low expectations but hopes high to see some bloody carnage on the silver screen yet again, I bought my ticket for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D. What I got was something I wasn't expecting, that's for damn sure.After we receive about five minutes of awesome flashback clips from the original slasher classic. The film begins the day after the events of the first film,. The townspeople of this small town decide to get some vigilantly justice on the infamous Sawyer family. Led by Mayor Burt Hartman (Paul Rae), they decide to burn down the farmhouse of the Sawyer family for their murders committed in the original film. After the fire, The entire family is assumed to be dead. But, being a horror film, we know this isn't true. Turns out an infant, Edith Sawyer, is found by one of the townsman who takes the baby in with his wife to raise her as their own.Twenty years later (or twenty some years later, the chronological continuity of this film is a bit on the wonky side), the infant has grown up to become a butcher with named Heather Mills (played by an appealing but far too trashy looking Alexandra Daddario). She receives news that her grandmother has died and she is needed to appear in person to accept her inheritance. With her boyfriend Ryan (a not terrible but not exactly good Trey Songz) and two other friends, Nikki (a slutty and altogether annoying Tania Raymonde) and Kenny (Keram Malicki-Sánchez) along for the ride, the foursome hit the road to Texas. They pick up a hitchhiker along the way named Darryl because they obviously have never seen the original OR the remake, otherwise they would know better that picking up a hitchhiker in movie with the any of the words Texas, Chainsaw, or Massacre in the title is a very bad idea. When they arrive in the town, Heather finds out that she has inherited her Grandmother's house. Like does she know, Leatherface comes with the land.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D is a movie that can be evenly ""sawed"" in half between the good and the very, very bad. Daddario is easy on the eyes as our heroine Heather but she is stupid as hell and doesn't seem to be smart enough to put anything together before the audience does. A late act reveal involving her character and another character is meant to be shocking but it is obvious from the moment we meet this person that they are nothing but trouble. Heather and her friends are stupid and honestly deserve to die. They make all of the typical horror movie mistakes. Let's check out the basement! Let's stop while running so the killer can catch up with me! But, as soon as..SPOILER ALERT: all of Heather's friends diethe film becomes shockingly successful and the last act has a rush of adrenaline that is shockingly missing from the rest of the film.When we are given the final twist (if you don't get this at least a half an hour before it happens, you need to give up your horror card ASAP), I was rooting with Heather as well as the movie instead of passionately against it. Who knew that all Heather's friends had to do was die in order for her to grow as a person and actually, shockingly, become likable. The deaths are hit-or-miss with a torso cut horizontally in half being the highlight and a terrible CGI death involving a meat grinder as the very low point. As bad as the first thirty minutes of this film are (the fire is laughably bad CGI from the early days of Nintendo 64), the last hour is definitely worth checking out. Don't miss the final scene after the end credits. It is a gem of dark comedy that is missing from the rest of the film. In the end, this Massacre isn't bad as it is forgettable. This blade definitely needs sharping.",Texas Chainsaw
135,jenaycarter,WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!,1,27 June 2019,Let's begin with saying what the the heck is this about?? I got completely confused after...I don't even know! This is really boring! The first few minutes of the movie was really boring!! Oh my gosh!!This movie has really bad CGI effects and the actors are acting as if they're still reading their lines with their scripts still glued to their hands! The guy who is acting as the Leather face doesn't have no type of charge to really get at his victims! Anyone who ever watched a Texas Chainsaw movie knows that Leather face is very fast paced and he will get who he's after!This movie has the worst and cheapest jump scares! The suppose to be face mask looks like someone's child took mud and put it on the actors face and called it a day!! If they ever consider making another movie like this...please don't! Because this is a disaster,Texas Chainsaw
136,snakes3992,Awful,1,29 January 2013,"What a f**king load of sh*t, this doesn't act like it takes place in the 90's, nice try I saw the Iphone, don't try to fool me. The characters are awful, including the main character, ""Heather,"" she is one of the stupidest character I've ever seen in this film. The dialogue in this film is awful; every line in this film is stupid, ""fruitcake"" come on that has got to be the lamest line I ever heard in my entire life, and the writing, OH GOD, THE WRITING!!! The writing is so awful, they try to make Leatherface a hero, (facepalm), he's a f**king slasher, not a f**king hero. The kills are awful in this movie; they repeat the same kills over and over again. The worst thing in this movie is the direction, OH GOD, THE DIRECTION!!! The directing is awful, every kill is poorly shot, and it has some of the worst 3D shots I ever seen, they just do it right in your face. The only good thing about this film is seeing the footage of the 1974 Texas Chainsaw Massacre, that's the only good thing about this film, the rest of it, just awful, do yourself a favor don't see this film at all, it's not worth it.",Texas Chainsaw
137,RogerCampbell,Could this be one of Freddy's Nightmares?,1,27 February 2013,"The title and cover art pretty much say it all for this movie. Incredibly there is a plot to this mindless mayhem, but who cares. Right? This movie isn't about having a plot or cheering for the good guy (or girl)..it's about killing people with a chainsaw. Steven Spielberg is probably wishing that he had come up with this premise.Bottom line is this: Hollywood will give anyone money to make a film especially if it has a chance to make money. Apparently these Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of films do make money because they keep coming back like a bad nightmare in a Freddy Krueger movie. Hardcore fans of the horror and slasher flick genre will enjoy it.If you have 92 minutes of your life that you would like to completely waste then this movie is perfect for you...but leave your chainsaw at home.",Texas Chainsaw
138,cfcurrie,"Not bad as a horror film, just generic.",4,31 October 2015,"Texas Chainsaw. The sixth sequel in a series where the only universally acclaimed film is the first. Each proceeding is by one measure or the next a dearth of quality, but is generally contemporary to the aesthetics of horror to when each sequel was made. So why would this movie be any different? Its not. The movie, to its most resounding credit, has one hell of an opening. The entire flashback sequence is stellar. But immediately the tone reverted to the current decade. The cast are all perfect pretty and perky, their logic is thin but moves things forward quickly, and there's a fratty, sorority vibe to the small group. The hitchhiker is hunky. The dialog is boring and there is plenty of skin to be shown (both men and women) but never anything beyond PG- 13. And as it was released as Texas Chainsaw 3D, there are a couple scenes that are intended to take advantage of this original intent. Texas Chainsaw gets a lot of flack for being an extremely bad movie, but it's not. It is not a good movie, but it has some iconic imagery hidden in its cleanly constructed horror tropes. There is nothing special about this movie outside Dan Yeagers portrayal of Leatherface. Director Johm Luessenhop has nothing to his credit that a horror fan would recognize, but he's competent. You feel that it was Lionsgate and producers that strap this movie down to its clichés. Of course, some glaring issues appear immediately. While the narrative uses the exact date of the house burning in 1973 as a plot device, it goes to great lengths to conceal visual references to the actual year. Perhaps budgetary constraints dictated, but our main character is barely into her twenties, so logically this film wild take place in latter half of the nineties. They choose to skirt retro, making it clear by gravestone of a deceased character that the events are in 2013. But then, cell phones are ignored. No ""we have no service"" bullshit, just a complete ignoring until a cop uses one to live stream his investigation of the house late in the movie. And Heathers moral reversal and family awakening is both jarring and confusing. It's a necessary evil to get the result the writers intended of having Leatherface turn anti-hero, but it also results in that third act fans find so appalling.For each moment that reveals a unique or insightful slight of filmmaking, there is a movement of tedium. And in the end it weights this film down into a generic, Netflix and Chill variety background horror movie. It's sad, as even as it manages to keep a tight wrap on cheap jump scares, it fails to build real atmosphere or tension. It's predictable, practiced horror.",Texas Chainsaw
139,Kevbo1985,"Unneccesarily Bashed, Interesting Twist On The Franchise",6,19 September 2013,"Call me a sucker, but watching this film (rental, minus the 3D trapping that aimed to draw people into theaters) actually made me think that the franchise still has something to offer. This film has something to offer for fans of the franchise, in other words.The twist, which I won't give away, appeals to me in a way that I can certainly understand many individuals not being able to relate to. That twist is what gives this entry into the series its identity, and the way it all plays out is something I wasn't entirely expecting. A very pleasant surprise, in terms of storytelling, which has never truly been the franchise's strong suit.The obligatory gore and guts are splattered everywhere across the film, with obvious 3D moments popping up appropriately, but somewhere around the last 45 minutes, you realize you're not just watching a splatter flick. There's more substance here than meets the eye, even if it isn't exactly revolutionary in horror film plot history.The casting was surprisingly well done, and unlike certain iterations of the franchise, avoids being a detriment to the overall goal.You're supposed to be scared, but at some point, the film attempts to coax a different feeling from the viewer. Whether or not it works is 100% subjective, of course, but in my case it worked. In the overall scheme of things, Texas Chainsaw 3D isn't the best film in the series (not by a long shot), but when you consider some of the absolutely ridiculous sequels of the past...well...you have to appreciate the gritty reality of this fresh take on a classic.",Texas Chainsaw
140,pr65,Superb B Movie 80's style!,8,30 September 2016,"This is a superb 'B Movie' and captures the feel of an 80's movie, i.e a time when life was simpler and films didn't need a 'message' et. I really don't know what people are expecting from a Chainsaw Massacre movie, art? If you're looking for some blood-pounding adrenaline- fuelled escapism with tons of mayhem and bucket-loads of blood and gory violence (and a few pretty 'Southern gals' thrown in), look no further, this is it! OK - it might be predictable/clichéd etc, but who cares, like I said, it's a Chainsaw massacre! Get the pizzas and the beers in, kick back and enjoy some mindless FUN. Yes, it's a bit of a black comedy too.Highly recommended. Ignore the whiners.... :)",Texas Chainsaw

142,HeirOfDorne,A nice addition,5,9 October 2013,"A GOOD HORROR FILM. First off I'd like to say that this is a good horror film especially since it is an addition to a huge series. In order to appreciate this movie you may have to be able to except that there is a flaw in the story. Many of you may be able to guess that yes, it is the year. Without showing the gravestones, the story would have worked well if it was set in the 90's which would have made the age of the characters more believable. That aside, this is a good horror film in for a genre that in all honesty has had way too many flops. This film is everything you expect from a ""Texas Chainsaw"" movie. Tons of gore that will make you squirm, and a couple scenes that will make you jump, along with a decent story. The concept was sort of similar to Rob Zombie's adaptation to ""Halloween"" where there is a survivor who was taken away from the family then reunited. I was slightly surprised by decisions made by characters in the movie, and was left satisfied at the end. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews, this is a nice addition to the Chainsaw series.",Texas Chainsaw
143,beachpatricia,One of the best Texas Chainsaw movies so far!,8,26 April 2019,"I have always enjoyed watching the Texas Chainsaw movies. I enjoyed this one because I liked the storyline to it. It was different. Okay a lot of people don't care for these kinds of movies. I get that. If you don't like being entertained by a creepy weirdo chasing people with a chainsaw, please don't watch it. To me there is nothing creepier than watching people being chased by a crazed guy wielding a chainsaw. I didn't get to see this movie in 3D but I was thoroughly entertained. As I stated earlier I liked the storyline to this movie. A young woman inherits a house from her grandmother and the secret that goes with the house. I'm not going to say more because I don't like spoilers. The acting was good in this movie also. Be warned, it does have gory parts. If you like the Texas Chainsaw movies, then by all means watch it!",Texas Chainsaw
144,MisterAwesome,Words cannot describe my disappointment,2,2 May 2013,"I have seen all the previous Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies and I must say I had pretty high expectations for this one. I liked the original movie most like many other people do, but I thought the sequels were pretty decent as well. This movie however is just a steaming pile of crap. When we meet the four (later on five) teens we instantly know that four of them are just collateral. The characters are really superficial. Even more so than in your normal teen slasher movie which this Texas Chainsaw movie turned out to be. I just can't stand how ridiculously stupid all of the characters were. Let me point out some examples: When a crazy chainsaw killer is on the loose you don't walk into it's lair as a policeman following a blood trail which is so huge and long that it looks like someone dragged a dying mammoth across the perimeter. Whenever this said policeman is going after this killer you don't ask him to give you 'visual' on his phone and make him call out everything he sees when he's supposed to be quiet. You don't stand there in the police office looking at the screen like you're viewing some kind of movie. You order him to stop and send 10 cars of backup to the house, heavily armed. When the crazy chainsaw killer murders all of your friends, but he appears to be your cousin who you don't even know, you are not going to befriend him. It's so lame they tried to make this into some kind of family reunion love story. It just doesn't make any sense. And these are only some of the ridiculous examples I could come up with. There are so many plot holes and idiotic character decisions that made this film unwatchable. I normally don't demand much from a horror movie, but this is just laughable.This movie is just an extremely ridiculous, on cheesy jump scares relying gore fest with horribly written characters and no significant plot at all. This movie is just a teen slasher, profiting from a very popular and highly appreciated name. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, not even when you are a huge Texas Chainsaw fan. You will definitely be disappointed by this pathetic so-called movie.",Texas Chainsaw
145,January39,"Massacre, well almost...",6,1 May 2013,"Okay, where to start.Heather gets some inheritance in the form of her newly found relatives, the inheritance is the family home (a new one?) and unknown to her, her fruitcake cousin (chainsaw link here). Proceed to kill all the cast one by one in variety of ways, add a mix of slaughterhouse and you get the picture.BUT...There's a Twist. A kind of sub plot about her family being murdered in cold blood, and a town that hates the Sawyer family. Who are the good guys and can she protect the Sawyer bloodline? This film is not as bad as the reviews here are giving out. I quite liked it in a way and the new twist works rather well. There are some pretty decent shocks and the way they have used original footage is inspired it really lends to the tale. It also nice to allow us to see that the family did integrate to some degree with the townsfolk which gives them an air of normal, which only adds to creepiness. I liked it.The problems come when using the cliché set pieces and the factual errors such as the leads age - if the family were murdered in 1974 and she escapes, by today she would be 38 - yet she looks 23 and so do all her friends -in fact one is a college student?? Leatherface, he must be OAP by now! The newspaper has a date of the 19/8 and yet the murders occurred on the 19/8 - in fact the night of the 19th. The Sawyer family home was burnt to the ground and her mother some how over the next 24_38 years (*see above point, age is fluid in this film) manages to amass a huge fortune so big she owns a mansions and ""load of other assets"" as quoted by Solicitor old guy! The rest is pretty murder by numbers, people checking things out on their own when they know the murderer has killed 3 people already. The cars that break down at just the wrong point, and chainsaws that seemingly never get blunt even cutting concrete and metal! Watch it, enjoy it, overlook its flaws and don't expect a masterpiece. Solid 6/10 for me",Texas Chainsaw
146,Micheal_Williams,What can I say... :o,7,8 January 2014,"I enjoyed this movie more and more as I went through it, yeah... it has plot holes it has bad actors, you can probably direct the film better yourself, but...It did what the other countless sequels spin-offs prequels did'nt- I finished the film and said to myself I would watch it again, don't get me wrong its not in any necessary case a perfect film- it a horror- you exspect crap younge good looking actors, you exspect a director who just wants a pay checks but I did not exspect to enjoy it whice I did mainly because the story (the proulouge).I would suggest you go on Netflix and watch this horror but I don't expect your like if your exspecting a perfect film that could win best picture",Texas Chainsaw
147,mrloughrie,"Well Done, John Luessenhop",3,22 November 2015,"This movie was not super good or super bad. It wasn't extremely scary, it was a little scary though. It wasn't super intense. It was just well done. It was okay, it was alright, it was not as good as the original.The first section of the film of good. Introduction to characters, jobs, what was happening, and I loved it. The second part was good. They drived, and like in the original they picked up a hitchhiker. He wasn't insane, but he was a thief. He stole things from the house they went to, it was a mansion so it was a jack pot for him. He finds stairs and decides to go down and see the things he can steal. He finds a metal door. Remember the metal door from the original? We all know the horrors that await behind the metal door. He looks at something else and then he got hammered from BEHIND and it was Leatherface. Leatherface hammered him in the head 20 times. The look of Leatherface was a bit, old. He looked old. The person who played Leatherface was 47 years old at the time. He might have had a hard time with those chase scenes!The worst part of the movie was its ""prequelity"". I know, that's not a word. But you know what I mean right? It is a bit of a sequel and a prequel. The beginning it takes place RIGHT after, like literally seconds after the girl escaped in the truck, Leatherface swinging his chainsaw like a retard. The police arrive and there is literally 10 people in the house that are all part of the family! Where did they come from? In the original they weren't there. So that part sucked. The rest was okay. The scariest part of the movie was when Leatherface was first starting to kill. Like the part when the girl was in the grave. Leatherface heard her crying a little, he then chainsaws the grave and she is screaming, saved by her friends when they came and said, ""Hey! Who are you? What are you doing?"" He looked behind and ran towards them. That was pretty damn good. That part was scary, and clever. Then he just chased them, then he ""got shot"" with the shotgun. Looks like it was false. They got in the car and drove away. They tried to bust through the gate and failed, the car seemed to have broke. They tried to fix it. Leatherface was on his way, he got closer. They tried to go but couldn't. The gate opened. Leatherface chainsawed the back off the car but then they took off. He threw his chainsaw on the ground with anger. Then he sees the tier broken, they crashed. Leatherface picks up his chainsaw and walks to the area.The girls wake up, they look behind them and see Ryan got his head cut off by the car window. Ouch! She screams. The two girls are alive and one cries and complains and then the girl says, ""Sh, shh..."" Then BAM! Leatherface's chainsaw busted through the window, one girl escapes and Leatherface is stuck with the other one, the girl that escapes says, ""Hey! Over here, yeah, you country f*ck!"" It angers Leatherface and he comes over and chases her, she finds fence, she climbs over the fence, it leads to a fair! She climbs it and goes in the crowd, Leatherface chainsaws the fence down, he looks for the girl in the crowd and everybody is screaming and running. She goes on the fair wheel, Leatherface sees her and goes below her and raises his chainsaw up into the air, she screams as the ride goes down. Then before Leatherface can inject his chainsaw into her anus, a cop comes out of nowhere and says to Leatherface, ""Drop the weapon, ..... Now!"" He throws the chainsaw to the cop but he ducks. He then retreats. The girl is saved and the cop is fine.The ending, this part probably fingered millions. The thing is, Leatherface, the killer, is the girl's cousin. Leatherface was about to kill her but she cries, Leatherface touches her face a little, he feels something, they are in a factory right now. He takes the mouth strap off and she says automatically, ""It's me! I'm your cousin!"" He jumps back in surprise and turns his chainsaw on and cuts the rope. She is free but then 2 men come and knock Leatherface in the head and stomp on his face. They tie him up. They make up attached to a rope that leads to a painful shredder, the man says, ""You're doing to die today! Looks like mother raised a bad boy! A murderer!"" (something like that, I haven't seen the movie in a while). The girl (Heather) wants to go back and save her cousin, she gets a broom and drives it through one of the stomachs. She saves Leatherface and they shred him. The sheriff comes and aims a gun at his head. She says, ""Don't shoot!"" when another brother says, ""Shoot him! Please he's about to kill me!"" the sheriff doesn't shoot. He says, ""Clean this sh*t up."" and walks away. He let the killer free. He may have killed hundreds of people in his lifetime. But now he is free, able to live with his cousin.So, overall the movie is cool. Check it out!",Texas Chainsaw

It's mild and pathetically similar to other franchises continuing to become less and less frightening and more and more predictable. I'm not sure about the credibility of the storyline - how did the grandmother even know where to send a letter to the child? The people who took the child never told anyone they took her, it's not like it was reported in the paper that a child survived. She would have just been presumed dead like the rest? They didn't look for Jed in the rubble and assumed he was dead this whole time. He's a big enough bugger to notice the absence of!Idiot protagonist woman keeps falling over and running into moving cars, getting into cars with people we all know are going to turn out bad. Makes you wanna sigh... You can see where it's going by the end. If she has Sawyer blood i'd have liked to have seen her with some more inherited crazy strength/more of a descent into lunacy. She was not a good heroine. There are more inventive bloody scenes in things like the Wrong Turn series, there's nothing that'll make you cringe or wish you hadn't seen it and i'm quite squeamish when it comes to torture porn. I think some people will be disappointed there are no boobies. As much as i hate cheap sex scenes in horror, if you're going to sit through a movie this bad i will accept that the odd booby shot may liven things up for the male audience when there are two young attractive women on the scene. Heck even if the men had taken off their shirts for no apparent reason i may not be as disappointed. What a waste of good chests all round.

151,shaososa,Big Wrong Turn For A Tiring Franchise,2,9 June 2013,"Compared to its peers like Friday the 13th, Halloween, and Nightmare on Elm Street, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series has been underrepresented a little. This is actually a good thing if you consider the overcrowded horror franchise it makes its playpen in. It would lead one to believe that with less entries tossed in the ring and with more time between them, the potential for making better movies should be high. But if Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D (what a title) is the evidence, then one believing that would be wrong.TC3D is the type of movie that lowers the bar for slasher films. The story expands on the events of the original film, but (while ripping off Rob Zombie's Halloween redux) is so ridiculous that few will appreciate where writers have taken the series. And even while trying to steer the franchise in a new direction, TC3D pantomimes its predecessors in execution with the same order of business we have seen already.There's lots of blood and overkill here with no panache to the madness and zero enjoyment to be had.",Texas Chainsaw
152,jerrywright15,A Bad Horror Start for 2013,1,4 January 2013,"Lately I have been having trouble reviewing titles because I like to go into depth with what is wrong and what is right with a movie, usually to the point of having too long a review for IMDb standards; so I stopped reviewing and just read others. That was, until I saw one of my most anticipated movies of 2013 tonight, Texas Chainsaw Massacre.I'm not sure I know how to began. We all pretty much know the history of Leatherface and the Sawyers. We know what made the original a cult classic and the sequels pretty good as well. You can't compare this 2013 remake to the original because its two different periods in cinematic history. Times have changed and what used to scare us and make us cringe on the big screen no longer cuts it. That being said, this movie falls well below par for any and every standard.This movie was fairly hyped up, the trailer showed great promise of being a big time hit, the cast and crew talked of how this movie was going to blow us away in terms of gore and unsuspected twist; and if your anything like the girls in my theater you couldn't wait to see Trey Songz take a stab at acting. All of this made for a movie that people were dying to see.I'm sorry to report that this movie tanked. I remember distinctly hearing someone in the back of the theater screaming ""that was it."" I myself was so let down that I was the first to walk out the door the instant a credit began to roll. I'm not going to bash the movie, citing everything that was wrong but I will ask you, what was it that made the original and some of the sequels worth watching? My answer, the brutality and instant quelling of any sort of hope. Leatherface was a cold killer with no emotion or empathy. The moment his victims stepped foot on his family's property you felt sympathy because you knew that, one, there was no escape, two, people were about to experience terrible pain, and three, someone was about to lose their face.Things that made this franchise great were, unfortunately,tossed aside. What used to be a twisted world that made you want to gag, became a world full of laughs (literally there was more laughing at the characters actions in my theater then screaming or cries of disgust.) Instead of focusing on the brutality of the films people were disposed of relatively quickly. It honestly felt like everyone important was killed off within the first ten to twenty minutes of the film and I was just shocked at how easy they were let go. The iconic scene of replacing Leatherface's face was tossed in like an afterthought, with the scene meant to be disturbing but falling sadly short.I won't knock on the script or the acting because I don't expect academy award performances or ""Good Will Hunting"" scripts. Its a horror movie as long as you can scream your golden, right? That being said I think Trey Songz should avoid horror as he just doesn't throw off that scared vibe.I gave the movie a one because of what it was meant to be and what it actually was. I feel they might have just killed this series, granted with the anticipation, they should make their money back and it seems there are some fans of this film so who knows.I'm disappointed and I think any fan of the franchise would be as well. Which is sad considering how enjoyable the other iconic horror remakes were; referring to, Nightmare on Elm Street (my favorite of the remakes), Friday The Thirteenth and Halloween.I have no problem saying I just flushed $13 down the toilet.",Texas Chainsaw
153,davidnhewko,I'm a saaaad Panda.,4,23 February 2013,"Mindset before movie: I was pretty excited to find out there was a horror movie coming to the theatre that is rated R. I didn't even care what it was, I mean 3-D horror movies, right? I already missed out on ""Silent Hill: Revelation"" in 3-D. But with all the recent slashers, excluding 2 or 3 in the last few years, horror has been letting me down a lot lately so I had some hope, but expectations were low.Mindset after movie: I forgot what I was watching until that guy with the chainsaw started killing people. I couldn't remember which slasher movie I was watching a sequel/ remake of. I was waiting for Sarah Michelle Gellar or Jennifier Love Hewitt to pop out somewhere, nope. Same old script, just different players. When they introduced the characters, I had some hope for the MMA trained guy, I thought maybe he would kick some ass, the ass kicking never came, not even a little. All the characters are stupid teenagers again, who all live in America and don't have any guns, again, all that stuff you think is gonna happen happens. I understand that this is a sequel to the original horror godfather of slasher movies, but that movie was great because it was one of the first. Now that plot line has been done at least 23,657 times(this figure is intended to be an exaggeration and is based on nothing) anybody with half a brain who has seen any slasher movies in their life can tell you exactly what's gonna happen, how it's gonna happen and won't hesitate to roll their eyes every time somebody trips on a tree root while running or fumbles with a door knob for 20 mins. There were a couple parts that were cool, don't get me wrong, like when the main star(I would look her name up on this website, but I don't respect her, so I don't care)bails hard running out of the house, I laughed really hard. When stupid characters do stupid things, bad things should happen to them. Needless to say, I was rooting for Leatherface because he was a smarter character (even with his handicap) and I knew he would survive. So the production wasn't terrible, the script was a regurgitated crap-shoot, the acting was as good as you'd expect from horror these days and there were some cool parts, oh, and that girl you want to see naked sooo bad...that didn't happen either.If you're like me and have seen a lot of slasher movies since the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, you will be let down by the it's ""sequel"". Letaherface started a movement in the 70s, a movement that hasn't changed at all since, other than the realistic gore they can make these days. Apparently slasher movies have to be the same. Same plot, same stupid teenage kids, same setting, same old bull crap. I'm starting to think that the producers who make slasher movies expect each member of its audience to watch only 1 or 2 slasher movies in their lives because every one they produce is only a shocker to an entirely new and oblivious audience. Either that or they just know we're all a bunch of suckers with wallets and hope for another slasher revolutionary like ""Behind the Mask"" and ""Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil"" .",Texas Chainsaw
154,TyRawrrnosaurus,Adding a Twist Does Not Redeem Bad Writing,3,8 January 2013,"Finding a home at Twisted Pictures, Texas Chainsaw 3D acts as a straight sequel to Tobe Hooper's 1974 original. Betting it all on a semi-twist ending to redirect the time line, TC3D is riddled with bad writing, weak scares, and is a pathetic attempt of 3D.For me, Tobe Hooper's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will live in infamy as my favorite horror movie of all time. It is psychologically and visually grotesque and disturbing. Aside from Jaws and possibly The Exorcist, not many films within the genre can say they withstood the test of time, continuing to be as frightening as when they first released. Needless to say, Texas Chainsaw 3D had a lot to live up to if it was going to be a direct sequel to one of the greatest horrors of cinema.Sadly, right from the beginning is where we run into continuity errors. After a few short flashbacks, we pick up immediately after the events of TCM, as a police car heads straight to the Sawyer house – Tobe Hooper's film never gave a name to the sadistic BBQ cannibals, but now they have one. Originally there was only the hitchhiker, the gas station owner, Grandpa, and Leatherface; in TC3D, all of the sudden, a whole slew of family members are seen within the Sawyer residence locked and loaded ready to protect Leatherface from the Newt, Texas sheriff and its residents. Where did all of these family members come from, we do not know, which is just one of the problems that make you scratch your head.Fed up with the Sawyer family shenanigans, against the better judgment of the sheriff, the town folk make grilled cheese out of the home and set it on fire. Only one Sawyer woman makes it out alive, only to be curb stomped in the face and her newborn taken away from by one of the men responsible for her peril.An unknown amount of time has passed, the infant has grown up into our final girl, Heather Miller (Alexandra Daddario). It's upsetting that the screenwriters never factored in any sense of time. If the original is set in 1974 and TC3D is set in the present (they use iPhones), that would put Leatherface at an age close to at least 60 and Heather 38, which neither physically resemble. Heather comes to learn she has inherited an estate from a grandmother she never knew existed. Here is where the fun begins. Or so we think.Fulfilling their cliché roles, none of these characters are fleshed out and we could care less as each one gets picked off one at a time. The only character we have to latch onto is Heather and we hardly even get a sense of who she is as a person. All of the actors within the movie do a fine job with what they were given, except the town mayor who comes off too cartnoonish with his strange agenda against the Sawyer family.The best part of the Platinum Dunes remake is the production design. The Hewitt home and Leatherface's basement were so well established that you felt generally terrified when any character entered the home. Not only that, but there was an unsettling feeling about the whole town. In TC3D the production seems so lackluster that there is no uncomfortable feeling, Leatherface's playhouse isn't interesting and the town could be any podunk town in Texas.Dan Yeager does a thorough job as the hulking mass that is Leatherface. His presence is felt whenever he is ready for the kill. Yeager also copies the mannerisms of Gunnar Hansen's 1974 Leatherface pretty well too. His masks on, the other hand, look cheap and hardly eerie.About halfway in, whatever little tension has been built fades away as the kids are taken out way too quickly. As an audience we should care whether anyone on screen gets hacked to bits, but not even the main characters are given time to express their terror. The sheriff is the most captivating one of the whole bunch and he is hardly in the movie. With everyone picked off, what's left is a staggering subplot that leads into a unique left turn for the franchise that ultimately sets itself up for a sequel. Horror movies are suppose to frighten and disturb, TC3D provides little tension along with uncreative kills, and couldn't live up to the task. Instead we get an intriguing commentary about family and coming to terms with your roots. But unfortunately the writing does such a poor job of leading us to that conclusion the ending of the film seems poorly justified. I appreciate the effort and ambition TC3D took to change up the stale franchise, but the writers/director could have put in a little more effort to build a better story.You would hope that the 3D would effectively enhance the scope or make the movie fun, NOPE. The 3D is a complete waste of time and effort. There is about 3-4 scenes where they utilized the third dimension to come at you, and the rest of the time it looks like an average 2D movie with no depth beyond the screen. Surprisingly, the picture was bright enough to see through the dark glasses.Texas Chainsaw 3D has some nice callbacks to the original, but even nostalgia can't help piece together this clumsily written film. With unsatisfying scares and characters we couldn't care less about, this entry is one of the worst of the franchise. Serving the viewer with a bigger question than its predecessors, TC3D sets up an appealing opportunity for a sequel that could potentially work very well for the series.P.S. There is a laughable scene after the credits if you are motivated to stay.",Texas Chainsaw

The backstory was slowly revealed at a decent pace.",Texas Chainsaw
156,akik1259,Not good,2,11 January 2015,"The only really good thing about this movie is that it picks up right where the original left off, with a new opening scene featuring many of the original actors, but sadly, they're barely used. After that it skips ahead to a new sort-of sequel, even though the time span doesn't make sense (It goes from 1974 to 2012, even though the main character, who was a baby back then, is in her 20s, but there's iphones and modern music too.) The characters are all bland and barely developed, including leatherface himself. The action scenes are just decent or really dumb, like the scene at the carnival. The gore switches from practical effects to bad CGI at points, and it's hard to take seriously. The movie is very straightforward, even for this genre, and there are some gaping plot holes and a twist ending that is so unbelievable that it actually upset me a bit.You should only watch this movie if you want to laugh at how bad it is. Other than that, don't bother.",Texas Chainsaw
157,dtrionfi36,I couldn't help but laugh,4,4 January 2013,"There are a few things that I had to chuckle at in this movie. For one, the fact that Heather was okay with all of her friends being murdered. Also I laughed at myself, because for a split second I felt bad for Leathrface when he had the chains around his neck and was being beaten. Then I remembered that he and his family were crazy cannibals and he really does deserve to die. Also the cop just being okay with Leatherface and is cousin was a bit weird. I also am confused by how old the characters a supposed to be. By their looks I would say mid 20's, but with the date of the original movie and the fact that this one takes place in 2012 does not match up. I also can't tell how I feel about how not scary this movie was. I think there was way too much of a back story in this film than there should have been.

By this movies logic, the original movie either takes place in the mid 90's (despite the opening crawl of the original literally saying it takes place in the 70's) or this one takes place in the 90's (despite the fact they even use IPhones in this movie). Neither one makes sense and overall this is just an awful movie.Also why do they attempt to make Leatherface some sort of anti-hero?

160,jrdragon40,A badly written but passionately pulled off piece of absurdity,6,5 February 2016,"First of all this movie is bad, if you don't mind that and can make it through the first 20 minutes with an open mind, it is actually mildly enjoyable.An interesting element of this Texas chainsaw film versus the other modern remakes, is this one directly connects with the original Texas chainsaw massacre film. Having said this, the style of this film is different than the other two. Where the other two had horror, sadism and griminess, this one is just...absurd, but with pretty cool villain development.If you happened to have played Resident Evil 4, you are getting the super chainsaw bad guy in this movie, and I thought the film work around our antagonist was actually intriguing, and kudos to the actor for his character work.If you don't mind lowering your film savviness (albeit pretty low) for this one, it is actually pretty entertaining.",Texas Chainsaw
161,ProfSpielberg,Cheesy 3D gimmicks with cheesier PC clichés,2,16 April 2014,"As a native Californian I've noted the tendency in one of our few remaining industries -- i.e. unoriginal ""reboots"" of movies that were way better left alone -- to unceasingly mock hayseed cowboy-hatted melanin-deficient Texans (occasionally, as in today's lesson, indicating them as the Root Of All Evil); but the conceptual choice here to bash on a stereotyped Deep-South-plus-Wild-West region standing in for the 28th state is a bizarre twist on the paradigm of the franchise, which had typically involved unwitting semi-sophisticated Austinites (or equivalent) captured by straightforward rural savages, no caricatured hero/villain template required. Probably it'll come as no surprise they've inverted that basic relationship: the bad guy isn't really bad, just misunderstood, or victimized by hicks, or by outsourcing, or something. That's our Leatherface, the gentle giant... Isn't it swell the final girl makes peace with him? Mere water under the bridge that he chopped up her (lesser) male friend; kidnapped her trashy two-timing female frenemy for slaughter; and essentially (via van destruction) killed her significant other Trey Songz, who despite questionable driving decisions, the only nice guy in the movie, unless the ineffectual wimpy Sheriff ""Hooper"" is counted. Paltry highlights from this cash-in include a crass but funny homage to the freezer gag in the original, and the intermittent attempted shirt-wearing of Alexandra Daddario who's got more jiggles than a bowl of Lake Jackson gelatin -- turns out they do grow everything bigger out there",Texas Chainsaw
162,boldentommy,A film for the ages.,1,16 May 2013,"What a problematic piece of garbage. In order to truly gain knowledge of how a bad a film is one must go behind the scenes and then watch the film. So for this review I will be doing just that. To start with this film was stuck in production hell, platinum dunes which had done the last chainsaw movies didn't want to do a third and thus opened the gates for a new company to take direction with the film. After a long drawn out process finally lionsgate purchased the film franchise and announced the film. Lionsgate who is in league with twisted pictures are known for horror movies now days so that could either be good or bad.In this case it was the latter. Now to start with the film.The film was directed by John Luessenhop and written by Debra Sullivan and Adam Marcus. With the exception of takers, I am really not familiar with the director but I can see where lions gate was trying to go but adding a fresh director to the franchise. Now the casting, The film stars Alexandra Daddario, Dan Yeager, Tremaine Neverson (trey songz), Tania Raymonde, Thom Barry, Paul Rae, and Bill Moseley. Now the casting choice was kind of strange to me but I guess they were relying on the singing career of trey songz to push the movie. Now the plot, The story centers on Heather, who discovers that she was adopted after learning of an inheritance from a long-lost grandmother. She subsequently takes a road trip with her friends to collect the inheritance, unaware that it includes her cousin, Leatherface, as well. So all together the film doesn't seem to bad, but after the first scene which was a continuation of the first movie the diarrhea dial is cranked sky high. The plot becomes a jumbled mess of teenage rudimentary writing and inane characters which are just stereotypical horror movie characters. Little or no frighting moments, no chemistry between actors, no believable anything. This movie takes everything that could be smart about the franchise and spits on it. Another thing about the movie that provides the biggest plot hole of them all is that fact that this movie claims to be the squeal over the 1986 film. Now I can see where this could happen seeing as how the film that happened in 86 was ten years later then the first film but this film skips all the way to the year 2012. There is nothing to like about this film accept for the opening scene. I found it very intriguing as how they used old clips and tied them with modern day story but then starts an even larger plot hole seeing as how none of the other family existed at the time and the 86 film showed leatherface and his father and I am guessing another brother but the opening scene has the father dying. So that totally eliminates number 2. So already I am confused then the characters, who cast these actors? I couldn't believe any of these actors as there characters and even if I could there was no character development to back them up. The film becomes stressful and feels long as there is a lot of nothing going on for a very long time.I can continue to say how bad this film is and then I realize that this movie was made for teenagers. It has to be there is no logical explanation of why it is so bad except for the fact that it is made for teens. But the ploy worked because it made its money back and then some to reassure us that there will be a sequel. Honestly I would rather watch the next generation. Yes I know its bad but to be honest at least someone in the movie was trying to do something other than just shat out a movie to make some money.There is no direction here and to pay the three extra dollars for two 3-d scenes was a complete ripoff. The film company has made a sin that they should bury and never dig up ever again.",Texas Chainsaw
163,m-mccabe-408-553138,Quite enjoyable.....but dumb,6,15 June 2017,"So this film bills itself as the direct sequel to the original 1974 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, even starting the film using archive footage from that film then continuing it on with a siege at the Sawyer house.The stand off at the house at the start really reminded me of the start of The Devils Rejects but not as well executed. The film then jumps about 20 years to a girl finding out she has inherited a house by a grandmother she didn't know she had so goes on a road trip to Texas with her friends to see it.I went into this film with really low expectation not expecting much at all but I quite enjoyed watching it but it is a very dumb film. So don't go into this film expecting a horror classic like the original. A couple of the dumb moments being the friends leaving a hitchhiker they just met in the house while they go shopping or how the main girl is in a crop top type thing for most of the film so her stomach is always on show and even when given a shirt to put on she only does up the top couple of buttons so her stomach is still on show constantly, even gets her shirt ripped fully open to then only do the top couple of buttons up again, it's very weirdly off putting. The acting is all OK nobody too awful, the story is alright, the first act is very normal predictable stuff, the middle I found quite interesting and then the final act was OK for me personally but it will definitely rub a lot of people up the wrong way I think. Final thoughts being quite enjoyable to watch but nothing special or memorable just don't take it too seriously. 6/10",Texas Chainsaw
164,rwunder,This movie kept me up at night,1,19 December 2013,"The the plot holes were so big, I was kept awake as my brain tried to process the inconsistencies and the nonsense. I kept thinking over the details and arriving at the same conclusion: ""That doesn't make any sense!"" This is a terrible movie. Read this and don't bother wasting your time. The logic is out the friggin window from the very beginning. In the first shoot out scene there are two cops on the scene and the second cop doesn't even help the first cop maintain order with the townies or help out with anything else for that matter. For such a big and volatile situation there would be an army of police. And what, they didn't have a fire department in a small town? That's just the first five minutes. It only gets worse from there. Sure they used some nice cameras to shoot it and there was some gore, but they changed the Leatherface character from a mindless killing machine with some mystery into a bumbling idiot with a chainsaw. To compound the logic issues with this mess, the twist in the third act just didn't make any sense. I mean, how could you watch your friend get cut in half by a chainsaw and then just be OK LIVING with Leatherface? How do you go from being chased by this dude who has killed off your besties to reuniting with him because you found out that he's your long lost cousin. You find out your real family is just a bunch of redneck murderers and then you decide that you have to pick up where they left off. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!! How does the good looking cop in his 20's not want to help this cute girl? He's just OK with his old man trying to kill her? How does the sheriff who has been trying to go by the book the whole friggin movie just watch Leatherface kill off one of his townies - bad guy or not? None of it makes any sense at all and the problems are so big, they make Leatherface look like a dwarf. You can even play a drinking game with this movie.

171,ScottPortals,Missed Opportunity Due to the Missing Key Element,4,17 May 2014,"There's a reason the original and some of its sequels/reboots worked. It wasn't just about a psychotic killer with a chainsaw. It was about a psychotic family, one of whom uses a chainsaw. Here we have the crazy family mostly stripped away. With it, the psychological side of horror leaves as well.Texas Chainsaw attempts to be a sequel to the original and introduces us to the world by reviewing the events of the first film from 1974, then making the rest of the film an extended epilogue to that. The first time I watched this (in the theater) I came out feeling disappointed as a long time fan of the series. Where was the gore and suspense? Where was the creepiness that created the horror outside of the shocking violence? After watching it again I think I judged it a bit too harshly, though it was no less disappointing overall. There is certainly a fair amount of gore, but the environment itself is sorely underutilized. Everything is mostly modern and non threatening (in contrast to the house itself being part of the madness) with the exception of Leatherface's lair. A small box does not a big picture make. They tried with the story here to add some depth to the legend, but in the end we are in a universe where Leatherface is just a character inserted for the sake of plot; someone to be even sympathized with despite being a brutal and ruthless killer. Not even particularly mentally unhinged as early incarnations would have us believe. If anything, this Leatherface is perhaps the least psychotic he has been. I understand that he is meant to be in his older years, but there is much less intensity in the character than ever before. It doesn't feel psychotic, it feels measured. The best way I can summarize is that it didn't leave me with any sense of dread after which a good horror movie should. Theoretically, a good sequel could be made to this (though hopefully never will be). There is ground work here for something more, but it's just not smart enough to close up the loop holes to provide solid ground to start from. They need more crazy, unhinged family to balance it out.

It can in no rational way stand with the original except in name only. However even in an irrational world this film struggled with basic plot and story development. It was pretty clear that the original draft of this film could have easily been a draft for Scary Movie or some comedy spoof of Scooby Doo.It did have all the right things to make it fit right in with modern horror films but executed everything so poorly you may have thought they were making it up as they went along. As bad as it was you were kind of entertained by the motivation to see if it could get any worse. The basic plot is about a girl who inherits a property belonging to her family that she never knew. It's when she finds out who her relatives are that the story begins.-dun-dun-duuuuuuuuh!!!I'm not going to comment on the acting because it is a teen slasher film so if you have high expectations then you may have deeper issues than this film. This film had beautiful girls, buff studs and sexual tension from the first narrative scene. Modern Horror. The lead actress was so anatomically perfect it was as if she were ripped from an adult anime film. The most entertaining part of the film centered was centered around how much attention this film wanted you to focus on the lead characters breast. Shot after shot combined with a specific wardrobe selection teamed up to say look at these(boobs) because they are important. Not to ruin it but yes indeed a breast became the turning point in the film. You are lured in with breasts shots but sadly the stars never leave the dressing room after all the build up.There were more impossible and improbable plot turns in this film than a choose your own adventure book. And also the signature fall when you are being chased maneuver is a go to play in this film. There is much to be desired and plenty to perhaps laugh about but in some way it was still entertaining for all the wrong reasons. I probably will not watch this again but will never forget what I saw either. Leave your brain and natural human instincts at home before viewing and you may enjoy this.5/10 stars",Texas Chainsaw
175,mcdopeshow,So bad that it's... bad!,2,3 May 2013,"Usually I give any movie the chance to surprise me in a good way. Being a huge movie buff, I tend to even watch and re-watch these series of ""nonsense"" slice-'em-up, gory pieces of film that are - or are supposed to - part of Cinema's history. Unfortunately this movie DOES NOT live up to that tradition. It's dumb, poorly put together, even worse acted and fails to create any atmosphere surrounding the usual suspect. It's weak. And it's so bad that it's.. well, bad. A dull exercise that rushes into the gory bits, as if those alone and poorly constructed can create a movie on their own. I can't advise this movie to anyone, even those that are missing out on anything decent to watch. It's not worth your time and the only way I'm writing about it is to warn you about the dullness of it all.",Texas Chainsaw

I expected to be entertained and nothing more. To be honest, I found that there were some clique moments in the film but in the overall sense it was actually a good horror flick. It was actually nice to see that the 'bad guy' was shown as the 'victim' in the film series. I also liked how the main female heroine decided to take on 'responsibility' of the family heritage. It was actually nice to see that happen instead of the basic good vs bad storyline. The psychological aspect is a part of film. Although it doesn't go into depth in the film. There is still a part of the film that you can enjoy by watching it. Just go see it without comparing it the original and I think you will very much enjoy it.",Texas Chainsaw

The lead role actress Daddario is well known to people since the movie ""percy Jackson"" but my expectations was on Tremaine Neverson aka Trey Songz. Trey Songz hasn't really stared in a movie and his debut with Texas chainsaw 3D was excellent. The bad part is the story of the movie and the ending. The writers kind of ruined the brand ""texas chainsaw massacre"" by making ""leatherface"" a good guy in the ending and the story based on a girl (Daddario) who is related with ""leatherface"". It all made me think of the Halloween movies though Mike Myers killed his relatives. If you're a horror fan, trey Songz fan i think you should see it but don't watch it alone its not worth it.

Once I hit the half way point of the movie I just shut my brain off and started to laugh. Eventually the entire theatre I was in did the same, and we had a pretty good time. The horrible thing about that is the laughing was not intentional. This is? a horror movie, but it seemed like a strange Texas Chainsaw parody movie.The plot line is as simple as a strange fan fiction, the movie went from horror to some strange pseudo family reunion film.

However, some remakes can change it up where it is the same concept with a fresh story and brand new look making it its own thing. This was not one of those movies. The acting for the most part was not bad. The movie was very predictable, but what makes it so bad is the ending. After leather face has killed all of her friends and a total of 7-8 people in this film a lone not to mention the teens he killed before the film they act as if all is well. The sheriff lets him walk away with no consequences and it appears as if his cousin, whose friends leather face torturs and killed, decides to care for him as her grandmother did. For one, the sheriff should have tried to kill or arrest him, but a more fitting ending would have been if she decided to torch the house and he escapes once again. Anything would have been better than them acting as if he was not a mass murder who that same night had just went on a killing spree. The movie would have gotten a 7 out of 10 because it is watchable, but that ending leaves such a bad taste in my mouth I had to drop it to a 5.",Texas Chainsaw

It certainly doesn't stack up to the original (or even the previous remake), but its a good chillin' on the sofa with popcorn movie. It's gory, it's bloody, it offers a few laughs throughout, and the acting is half decent for a Slasher flick.

Those ""poo hooers"" really need to step back and think ""what did I really expect"" YES it is cliché, YES there were plot holes but overall I enjoyed it a it is a good no brainer. Not over complex, not trying to be something it isn't or all post modern confusing drivel like some modern tosh. Having seen and subsequently cacked my pants at various horror movies over the years this wasn't too shoddy. The acting was good, the ambiance and lighting very reminiscent of the original with some good scares and a nice, excuse the wordplay, ""chunk"" of gore and blood with a satisfying twist (although predictable) at the end. Typical horror characters and,for once, the usual ""he's a knob I hope he gets it"" actually delivered. By no means a patch on the first movie or a ""that has to be in my DVD collection"" but an enjoyable horror none the less and definitely much better than some of the sequels in the franchise (especially the awful ""Next Generation"" pap).Like some other reviews have stated, if you want a complex brain twisting plot and Oscar driven performances then it may not be for you but if you want some good old blood,guts and not have too think to hard then see it.",Texas Chainsaw
186,harjwarrior,Leather face is creepy,8,27 October 2013,"I really have enjoyed watching leather face the Texas massacre movies through out the years they have such a creepy scary feeling about them because legend has it to be a true story which makes it even more frightening. The 1974 massacre is the creepiest for me i actually did get disturbed and scared watching it back then because the scenery and music is very scary to watch and hear so cold and eerie. This movie for me starts of from the prev one where they are all in the house and then the story unfolds i think the acting and story is well written, and the scenes with leather face are quite scary similar to the old movies the only different feeling is that this is now that was then this is a more updated version. I think this movie has some scary moments so thats why i will give it a pretty decent 8 for leather face fans thanks and enjoy and after watching the movie don't go to the toilet in the dark you might get scared LOL",Texas Chainsaw

I gave it a gracious 8 because I enjoyed the old school aspect it tried hard to partake. The modern day ""gore"" movie lovers wont like it so much (although at some points there is a fair amount of gore). This movie although modernized in its cinematography, still had a strong storyline (in my opinion), a lot of tension and build up in the story (something modern horror leaves out), and a pretty nifty twist which i wont spoil. The beginning will sort of remind you of The Devil's Rejects but still is good. This movie literally transitions right where the original left off. All and all it was more old school with storyline but modernized in film quality. If anything it was a great homage to an original horror classic.Some people thought it was cliché' but think about all the 80s horror movies a horror fan loves. They all had the same storyline with a different killer. Dumb teens making dumb decisions and end up getting killed. That's what you get here and I believe it was respectful to the original but added more gore to appeal to this warped younger generation. All in all I give this at least a 3.5/5 for the mere fact of if anything it was a great homage.",Texas Chainsaw

190,jeremy_steines,Honest review,6,31 December 2020,"The film ignores all the other one but 1 and 2. Timeline is a bit wonky no doubt. If you can ignore that you will likely enjoy the film a lot more. There is no nudity which is a welcome change. Leatherface isnt Jason Vorhees and isnt killing because they had premarital sex. Nudity would have been nothing but exploitative.The film puts a different spin on a well visited franchise. The story itself is solid and the actors are well above average for the genre. Dialog and reasoning are pretty bad at times. When the final act begins the main girl becomes a target of the mayor and most of the police. This leads to her decision to help Leatherface. People complain that she protects Leatherface after he killed her friends, but he also saves her when the Mayor and police want her dead. Plus lets be honest, she is a Sawyer so her gene pool isnt exactly top notch.So enjoy it for what it is. An average horror flick that has a few twists but nothing game changing.",Texas Chainsaw

It's unfortunate with a $20 million dollar budget that they could have done this SO much better! I mean, couldn't they really find a director with a different vision instead of a horror movie with scantily clad women running and falling. Not to mention, casting an R&B singer. I mean really!!!!! Don't get me wrong, there were a couple, and I only mean a couple, good parts but basically it was just a let down!

The movie is completely unrealistic, I mean... Everyone is attractive, everyone!! Except for the one or two rednecks... And the acting is so, so bad... The cousin of the TCM barely cared when ALL of her friends died. And how towards the end, how she saved her cousin and said, ""Do your thing, cuz"" got me, literally, ""ROFL""ing... Are you serious?

193,greenwater19,Pretty Good Movie!!,7,26 February 2013,"I had a chance to see this right after it came out. Pretty good, solid writing, though somewhat disorganized. Texas Chainsaw 3D, has quite a few above average scenes, in it. My favorite, and I think most of those who will see the film, had to be when Leatherface terrorizes those at the local fair, the carnival. He comes yielding his chainsaw at the running crowd, its really scary, and creepy. You have to see this, a good action scene, and very effective. Another gory scene and one you will not see coming, is when the cop enters the home, the mansion, to check on whether leather face is in the home or not, and soon discovers the grossness of the underground cellar. He then gets massacred by leather face, such a good scene.Overall, you really might want to try and see this one, the Texas Chainsaw 3D, you will be quite shocked at its intensity, and gore! However, this is indeed not the greatest Texas chainsaw movie, but its different, and has an interesting plot to it. I give it a pretty solid, 7 out of 10 rating.",Texas Chainsaw

I thought the opening sequence was amazing. The 3D conversion of the original film was really cool. After that the introduction with the main cast was corny but pretty much every horror movie is, because for some reason producers don't want to spend money on actors that can carry on a scene without running and screaming. When the horror begins, it starts to get better. I really liked how the film was unpredictable and you didn't know what was gonna happen next. Overall this film gets a 6/10 because it pays good homage to the original 1974 film, while adding different, original elements to the genre. Just don't take this movie seriously, because you will be disappointed. Go into it thinking it's a continuation/spoof of the original film, because this movie has some pretty funny moments.

It has a good plot and good characters, some actors not as experienced as the others but, they were not terrible at all. Alexandra Daddario did such an amazing job as Heather. This movie actually scared me too with all of the gore and the intense chase scenes. Don't listen to what anybody else says, go see this movie, it is awesome and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.

197,kyleoc-599-658723,A Brutally Fun Re-boot. A Healthy dose of action meant for classic horror fans,7,17 December 2014,"Texas Chainsaw 3D went above my expectations. The last half of the film takes an interesting turn and the fight sequences throughout are a little more intense than I had expected (not torture, but actual fighting and slashing). The acting is actually pretty decent in this film and it has a fair enough amount of suspense and action that were worth my time. 3D is not as suspenseful or disturbing as 'The Beginning', but definitely follows the classic slasher style, which was great to see. The 3D scenes were a little cheesy and could use improvement, but it didn't take away from the movie too much.I would highly recommend this film if you are already a fan of the series, or just looking for a brutal slasher film.

When I did so, I was kind of put off by the HORRIBLE reviews and pretty bad rating I saw on the web, but I decided to watch anyways.I undestand why you wouldn't like this kind of film, since it messes with the Leatherface personality which had been portrayed so far, and basically since it's very very different from the original. However, what did you expect!? The same exact thing but with a greater budget?Although some parts of the movie don't sit right with me, the script could be better, and effects are not the best, I enjoyed this movie! Might be worse if you compare it to others in the franchise, but I think it's a nice independent movie.To sum up, it's not the best movie I've watched by very far, but it's nice and entertaining - definitely not a 4.8/10 (August 17th, 2021).

203,wytsharkmedia,Reprehensible,1,19 May 2013,"** SPOILERS ** Woof...what a dog. This movie should exist only as a teaching example to young screenwriters and directors on everything NOT to do when constructing a movie.First off, why bother? This franchise was played out back in the 80s when the infamous Cannon Group tried to make a go of milking it for dollars. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is an icon in horror cinema, and for good reason. The utter simplicity of it's story and approach, matched with a lightning-in-a-bottle performance by a cast that was literally being driven crazy by director Tobe Hooper in 120 degree Texas heat, pulsates with a gritty realism that is hard to shake. The moment you slick things up and start noodling with the plot, the whole mess is going to collapse like an over baked soufflé.The Michael Bay reboots had a certain something about them that made them watchable--even enjoyable--but this hackneyed attempt is rotten to the core.In the featurette, producer Carl Mazzocone confesses that his plan was to reacquire the rights and create a 6 movie franchise like Saw. If the trajectory of that arc starts this low, somewhere around #4 they won't bother to make a movie, they'll just throw you down a flight of stairs when you show up to the theater.Mazzacone is just thinking dollars, and it shows. His reverence to the source material only goes so far as to use a ton of it in the opening credits and give Gunnar Hansen (the original Leatherface) a cameo.The script is everything I hate about current Hollywood storytelling. All the characters fit a type and never veer from it, never speaking or behaving like normal people. Every action they perform is in service of forwarding the plot. There's nothing organic or believable about a single person in the whole film, and thus: who cares. It's all just meat being carved up. And you can pour as much blood on it as you want, it doesn't make me care, and it doesn't make me scared.I don't know how much to blame the director for my next gripe, because I suspect this has more to do with some arrogant producer forcing his creative input into the editing: for horror to work, it needs to breathe. Horror is all about the build of tension and the release. MTV style hyper editing will kill any and all suspense instantly. This film is in such a hurry it never pauses to let the audience bask in suspense. But it will hang around for 10 minutes at a stretch while it dolls out it's convoluted plot.Yes, and lets talk about the horrible plot. When the idea of turning Leatherface into the hero at the end and having the main girl turn out to be his long lost cousin came up in early creative meetings, someone with half a brain should have spoke up and nixed it then and there. Just bad, just horribly horribly bad, and completely miscalculated.But then this is the creative crew team that thought having lead Alexandra Daddario blatantly running around in a belly shirt the whole movie would be sexy, not completely awkward and distracting. Or, when Daddario gives Leatherface back his chainsaw so he can dispatch the corrupt mayor of the town and says ""Do your thing, Cuz"" that the audience would cheer in appreciation, not nearly kick in their flat screen in frustration.To surmise: attractive actors are wasted on hack writing, decent cinematography can't make up for a director that doesn't know how to tell a story visually, a greedy producer dreams about franchise money and skips the whole part about making a movie worth watching. Awful, terrible and a total insult to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",Texas Chainsaw

It's hard not to think of it as another cliché slasher movie, and that's exactly what my dad and I expected before we watched it.The first half of the movie, as expected, is just as predictable as any other psycho-chasing-killing-teenagers movies. The plots are unclear, weak and full of mistakes. A lot of things don't make sense in the movie. However, in the second half of the movie, things started to get interesting and different. My dad and I actually enjoyed it a lot. I love how the movie has put a more humane twist on the serial killer. And we were actually rooting for him.I'm actually surprised and not so surprised that this movie gets a low rating score. I'm surprised because I think it at least deserves a 6 or above. I'm not so surprised because it's normal that people would be pulled off by all the plot holes. I would say that if you are not very critical, then you would most probably enjoy this slasher movie with a pleasant surprise.

I heard that they were scrapping all the prequel stuff and going for a straight sequel of the original. Sounds good...until I watched it. The movie starts off well enough by recapping the original and then moves into the typical stuff. A group of twenty something CK models pack up their van and head to Texas because the main character inherits the house from the grandmother (a Sawyer) she never knew she had because she was taken away from the Sawyers when she was a baby. Got it? Good. Wait! Did I say twenty something? How is that possible if the original took place in 1974 and this takes place in 2012? Would that mean that the main character should be at least 38 years old? Yes it does, but oh well! Right? HA HA HA! RIGHT??! Anyway, the movie progresses with the typical slaughter of the underwear models when all of a sudden, Leatherface becomes....becomes...a good guy??? What the *bleep* *bleepin* *bleep*??? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Really producers? Really writers? C'mon guys! Its not that hard, is it? I mean, we only expect so much out of these movies.

It had a mediocre script and didn't pay much attention to technical details corresponding with the past films that, after being pointed out to me, had me cringing.The movie had its good moments as well as its bad ones but over all I found it to have a really good story (even though that might not stay true to the nature of the series) and I liked how the movie showed how tight family ties can be and how far they will go for each other.

Obviously, these ""teenagers"" were just picked by the casting department because people thought they were attractive. That being said, the acting is pretty bland. Not walk-away-from-the-screen awful, but not very convincing either.Basically, the cousin of Leatherface gets a notice saying she's inherited all this property from a dead grandmother she never knew she had. She says, ""Oh, let me just take all my friends to go down there and see it!"" She goes down to Texas (bad choice to begin with if you ask me), her friends die, she feels pity on apparently mentally handicapped Leatherface and in the end she stays with him and continues on his ""legacy""... if you want to call it that.I won't go into all the wrong'ings about this movie, as I see other people already have. Overall, they tried, and as a scary movie in general I give it about a 6 for a few cool scenes (the carnival, the factory death in the end) but as a part of Texas Chainsaw legacy? Phishaw, I say. Away with the 2 girls who could have asked the costume departments for shirts that actually fit them.

Where do I even start?When did the Sawyers extended family turn up in the original? before I knew it there were psycho hillbillies everywhere blasting away for all they were worth Were there any actors in this film? some of the Characters must have secretly invented time travel, they looked the same age even though the original happened almost 40 years ago......and there no way Alexandra Daddarios character was 40+ Heather was Leatherface's Cousin FFS! Heather, having seen all her friends slaughtered by her psychotic, chainsaw wielding cuz, teams up with him at the end and spends the rest of her life caring for him.... Also how stupid do you have to be to trust a hitchhiker, you met a couple of hours ago, leaving them alone in your newly acquired mansion filled with silverware and valuablesI cant even put into words how awful this film is.....I did give it 2 marks as there is two bits of gore I enjoyed, but there was no tension, no plot, no character development, a cameraman who was obsessed with female butts and no point. Watching this film was a chore another classic example of a dried up, unimaginative film industry treating its audience with contempt......avoid at all costs",Texas Chainsaw
209,JuryOfWolves,This one massacred the Texas Chainsaw reputation,1,18 January 2014,"I absolutely love movies and horror movies are ones I've always enjoyed. I even have a admittedly low standard for horror movies these days because of my love of being entertained, scared, and grossed out and I think it's ridiculous when people just bash every horror movie they see because those people are obviously never impressed because they're too good for everybody.THAT BEING SAID... This movie is--remember I do NOT say this about movies much--one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is an absolute disgrace to the horror genre and to movies as a whole. I'm astonished this has a 4.8 rating. I've been putting off making an account on here, but I made one finally just to rate this movie. Here's why:It has one of the most basic painful cliché horror movie plots, and even that's to be expected. But this one is so bad that it has absolutely NO creativity, uniqueness, or anything to make you remember this movie. Every sequence is so forced and rushed just to meet this basic plot line. The lines that these poor actors were told to say make you cringe almost the whole movie because they are so predictable. I hate when people laugh at horror movies, but I was laughing at this one at some points, I couldn't help it. The main circle of 'kids' all get killed within what seems like minutes of each other, leaving no room for viewer-fear or suspense (crucial part of a horror movie). Also leaves no room for creativity in each fight/chase/death, can't stress enough how much creativity this movie does NOT have. The bloodshed takes off so fast (in a bad way) and every part about it is incredibly basic and you don't even think to be scared. Not to mention the carnival scene is absolutely god-awful. ""Hey there's a bunch of open land to run but let me grab onto this ferris wheel bucket to get away and then scream hysterically when it (whataya know) starts bringing me back down on the other side."" I mean honestly, who thought of that and was like, YES LET'S DO THAT IT'S SO SCARY. I thought the quick bloodshed was weird until I realized they were forcing it in order to get on with the OTHER side of the 'story' involving the townspeople, mainly the mayor who has some of the most cringeful dialogues I've ever seen in a movie. This side of the story (last half of the movie) absolutely finished off my disgust. It is SO corny and lazily written that it hardly makes sense and you don't even know what's going on or who to root for----and not in the like ""omg this is so intense I can't decide who I want to prevail!"" but more like ""I'm genuinely confused as to what these writers were even thinking at this point, did I miss something?""----As some other reviews have pointed out, things in this movie don't even make sense. The main character is younger than she should be according to the plot. It's hard to ignore stuff like that and it's hard to get into the movie when you know the filmmakers were just careless and lazy. This movie has no respect for the Chainsaw movie franchise. It was essentially made to show you what a chainsaw coming at your face in 3D looks like. Yea...cool....I was a tad nervous when I heard this movie was being made because it seemed too soon and not much more could be done with it, but I was still excited. Of course I loved the original, goes without saying. And I LOVED the 2003 remake and its prequel because they were a great adaptation with modern movie-making. They were suspenseful, entertaining, gross, and scary. The only one this one SOMEWHAT accomplishes is gore and let's face it...that's not very hard.Stay away from this movie. Even if you're an open-minded horror movie watcher like myself. Nothing will entertain you. The only reason you should watch this is if you need to reassure your ability to identify a piece of junk movie. I have to say though, it did win the award in my mind for THE most cringeful, ridiculous line I've ever heard in a horror movie. ""Do your thing, cuz"" comes out of a character's mouth towards the end of the movie which, to me, was pretty much ""Yea, viewer, if you haven't gotten the idea of what caliber this movie is, here it is, this is what we're about.""Terrible.",Texas Chainsaw

So I thought I'd let you know, if you like corny slashers, this'll kill an hour and a half. It's really awful tho. The story is so stupid for a Texas Chainsaw movie. It's about decent for the first half. Then it gets really absurd. The acting gets real bad too. But if you're like me, you'll stick it out. My least favorite of the series, definitely.

Not once did they mention the cannibalism from the previous movie (that I noticed) and I knew what they were trying to do the whole time and I still ended up rooting for freaking Leatherface of all people. I was honestly pretty content with the ending and was laughing over it the whole time. It's what I was hoping for after all lmao. I went ""omg you know what would be a funny ending???"" And then it HAPPENED. It was an enjoyable turn-your-brain-off kind of film. And no it does not deserve 10 stars but I think it deserves a higher overall score so I'm trying to raise that. I'd honestly give it a 6-7 for the entertainment value.",Texas Chainsaw

Remember that old joke where you want hours of your life back for wasting it on some crap movie? Well, that's exactly how I feel now. I only watched this movie being a long time horror fan especially of the Texas Chainsaw franchise. However, I have lost all hope that there could ever be a successful relaunch in the horror genre. This movie was just bad. Instead of recommending my friends and family a good movie, I'm going to be going around warning people not to waste their time on this one. I think 4.8 rating on IMDb is plenty generous for this mistake and a half. John Luessenhop, I hope you don't pursue any further film projects.

214,sexygeek11,Worst movie ever.,1,6 January 2013,"I love cheese. I am easily entertained. Love some gore. This movie failed in every aspect. The acting was worse than going back in time to a 80's B flick. Really, that was the best human mask you could come up with for special effects? All that 3 D money gone to waste. It reminded me of looking through my old school view master. The story was ridiculous. I do admit it was funny to laugh at. The Jessica Biel Chainsaw, is one of my fave scariest movies of all time. It was actually scary. The original one was scary, despite being old school. This turned it all in to one big joke and I don't mean in a good way. There was ONE good line in this movie, towards the end that cracked me up. Just all to foolishly done. Reminds me of the mockery films. Surely they did not expect this to be taken seriously in the horror genre.",Texas Chainsaw
215,jaxy-95,Pretty good!,8,20 June 2013,"Texas Chainsaw 3D was actually very good, and the 3D was pretty cool. Dan Yeager (Leatherface)was awesome, and the best Leatherface since Gunnar Hansen. This Texas Chainsaw film was better than the other sequels. There is somethings in the film that could be better, but i didn't care much about that. Because i have been waiting for a Texas Chainsaw film since The beginning, and was pretty good and i hope there comes a lot more Texas Chainsaw Massacre films. Alexandra Daddario is very beautiful and has a good career future. The plot is very good, and there is good actors. And now i cant wait for the next Texas Chainsaw Massacre film. And i really hope its as good as the original from 1974 or better. All in all a good horror movie and my rating is 7. Hope it's many years ahead with many TCM movies.",Texas Chainsaw
216,ethanrachlis,Most Confused Ethics Ever,1,25 June 2013,"What ever happened to simple story lines. For example, some friends go to a house and get killed... simple enough? It worked in the original, so what's the sense in over complicating things. The writers set themselves into a trap when they tried to figure out what was right and what was wrong in this movie. It doesn't work. It's the same action that takes course when you want the audience to sympathize with the villain (which is just silly, but works under certain circumstances; although it doesn't here because the villain is a blatant menace to society), except it's trying to advocate against murder but all in the while defending murderers. It makes no sense. The characters are all genuine hypocrites and none of them really matter until the last third of the movie. Kiss the friends goodbye because they didn't mean jackshit in the first place and that plot line for the boyfriend cheating on him goes nowhere. It's a mess and loaded with really bad effects. I would give them credit for attempting to do something different, but the elements of today's crappy horror is still evident. Not much more of a bad movie than Evil Dead was, but that movie was able to get through some solid character development without overdoing it and had unbelievably good practical effects as well as a chilling atmosphere. Personally, I wouldn't see it again. I'd stick to the original, the more basic, and genuinely scarier of the Texas Chainsaw movies.",Texas Chainsaw
217,JonJo979,Brilliant and a fantastic follow up to the original!,10,10 January 2013,"Went to see this in 3D, it was really good especially when the chainsaw was thrown at us, it was scary especially when Heather and Nikki were in the car trying to escape, then Leatherface pops up and tries to kill Nikki and Heather, scary as hell! The post credit scene was funny, of course everyone had left when the credits were rolling, I didn't trust Darryl though, there were homages to the original especially when Kenny was killed on the hook. Overall I think that Texas Chainsaw 3D was fantastic and I don't see what the problem was with it, I didn't see any problems with it at all. Leatherface was my favourite character as I felt he was misunderstoood, my least favourite character is Darryl, he was a complete d**k.",Texas Chainsaw
218,linkinpark45,What were you guys expecting?,1,7 June 2013,"I started to watch this when my mood couldn't get any lower...i was wrong, i was horribly wrong. It's a touching story of how Leatherface becomes an antihero, the girl who was inside a coffin when nearly becoming sushi decides to stay with a killer under the same roof (blood is thicker than water) and a police officer who allows a deranged killer kill a person without interfierence - where's the Oscars when you need them? I'm not much of a reviewer but i'll give it a shot.What i liked about this movie: I guess seeing some footages of the 1974 masterpiece; Just a chainsaw making noise; The ending credits (which sucked also)What i didn't like about this movie: God-awful killing scenes, very little with a chainsaw for that matter; A plot that doesn't stand a chance against a hygiene commercial's plot; 3D effects that suck ass; The fact that it's both boring and non thrilling; The fact that everybody, except the cousins, play absolutely no role whatsoever.Sometimes the remakes aren't good, but they're bloody and thrilling...well...my hope for good remakes is gone forever. 0/10 - if it were possible.",Texas Chainsaw
219,polokill,Not something Hitchcock would commend but still pretty good,6,1 May 2013,"Let me start off by saying, I am not a fan of the Texas Chainsaw series, not even the original but this movie wasn't half bad. I did like the original but not as much as people made it out to be but I hated all the sequels and remakes. This is the only one after the original that I actually kinda liked. It had some tense moments, some good scares and I actually like Leatherface's new mask. The script wasn't something great but it was alright and the actors were pretty good and if there was an award for best eye candy, Alexandra would take the gold. Despite some good scares, the movie was still bad mostly because of the direction which was lazy and felt like the director was trying to recreate Tobe Hoopers original style but in a very poor way.

220,biggishlou-242-950725,Horrific.,1,17 January 2014,"This movie is absolutely disgusting. I can't seem to understand how a movie can singlehandedly discredit the most discomforting and terrifying families ever. This movie is not about The Munsters, no, it is about that old family down in Texas that ate folk and were seemingly blessed with longevity. Now, in this new installment, in the opening sequence, they kind of come across as the Duke family from Hazard County. And then the rest of the movie was c**p too.One can't blame the actors. They were fine, bad just like the majority of horror actors. The original certainly didn't stand out for its acting, and the kids were annoying as they are in this new one. But there is just nothing remotely scary here, in fact it's pretty funny which makes it a disgrace because the original is not funny at all.The story is awful, a convoluted joke, an attempt at a back story that is unwritable. Through out there are little tributes and parallels that just p**s you off. The production design is c**p, and its shot very clear and bright so one can see how crap it all is. Nothing was clear (including the back story) in the original which made it appropriately simple and scary. Here we have a complicated mess with nothing to redeem it's self. I did kind of like the gore, but it didn't make it alarming, and I liked the voluptuous women, neither of which were in the original and neither make a better movie. And to top it all off it was 3D which is a stamp they put on c**p.This would have been great as a ""Scary Movie 9, Texas Saw"" but it was supposed to be frightening. It's hard to say what made the original so great, but when something new and c**p attachés it's name, it takes way from the greatness.",Texas Chainsaw
221,simpletreatment23,Oh wow. Texas Chainsaw 3D was a complete and utter waste of what could have been a fun slasher movie.,1,6 January 2013,"It is unoriginal, uninspired, unscary and so badly put together that it is a miracle that crap like this got made in the first place. I'm a huge fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films (I love the original film and I adore the second part) hell, i even liked the remake and the follow up to the remake. But this film makes the last two films seem like the Exorcist compared how terrible this film is.I first rolled why eyes when i heard who was picked to direct this film, the director of ""Takers"" which looked like an unoriginal music video looking wannabe gangster film and John Luessenhop lived up to that. This film is completely unoriginal and he creates no tension or scares. (light spoilers below) As a horror fan, I don't ask for a lot... just show me a good time. I can watch a stupid ass horror movie as long as it's not boring and doesn't insult me as a fan. This film did both. The first being that it's clear that no one gave a damn about telling a good story... want proof... the film opens up with a scene that takes place in the early 70's with a character being a baby... then the film jumps to the present where the same character is in her mid 20's (i kid you not. she should be 40!!!!!) that's how little they cared. The characters are so badly written and in the case of the men... so badly casted. Man, you know your in trouble when they put a special credit that says ""introducing"" Trey Songz, which makes me wonder if they even saw this film because he's Busta Rhymes in Halloween Resurrection cheesy and terrible in this film. He clearly doesn't have any real talent or charm as actor but the producers thought it would be ""kool"" and ""hip"" and that ""the kidz today"" would run out to see him and hear him on the soundtrack because that's what kidz like in scary movies. the only saving this film from completely earning my hate is... Alexandra Daddario. She was out standing. She took a badly written character and really made brought her to life. She gave a paper cut out of a human being... emotion and made me stay with the film despite how terrible the film is. She's gorgeous, i love her eyes and has an amazing stomach (who the director felt he had to show off any chase he got... but I'm not hating ;p) it's only in the last 20 minutes where the film actually gets pretty good, mainly because they stayed with Daddario's character... which is how the movie should have been. Daddario is a real actress... unlike the male characters in this film. Tania Raymonde was gorgeous and played her slutty character down to the letter... nothing more... nothing less. The last 20 minutes is the only thing worth watching. Besides that, it's a complete waste and an insult to real horror fans. This film wasn't made for fans... it was made by people who wanted to sell out the infamous horror series to the modern kids... with no care about telling a good story or making a good film. You can tell because they took Massacre out of the film title. They had a terrible script and it looks like they didn't really care. They had a director you didn't care as well besides making it look ""kool""... and they failed at everything. Don't waste your time watching the first hour of of this unoriginal Hollywood committee made crap.",Texas Chainsaw
222,jasony7152002,"Not A Perfect Film, But A Lot of Good Fun Anyway!!",8,21 April 2013,"I rate it 8 out of 10 mostly for cast(main) performances and overall fun factor. Yeah, there are some unavoidable story problems and the majority of the characters are weak but they get killed off in the first 30 minutes so who cares. Do you go to a Chainsaw movie expecting Shakespeare? NO! You go to see Leatherface and to see how far he'll go with his Chainsaw!! The kills were awesome, the intention of the link to the original is genuinely good and Leatherface was very well handled. I can't wait to see where it goes from where the story left off.

223,Jason_Marsh_35,I already forgot about it,2,4 January 2013,"Pure garbage. They set the movie in 2012, 39 years after the original. The only character that aged was the Sheriff. The main character was a baby in 1973 but is miraculously only about 22 or 23 in 2012 (which they clearly display on a grave stone, 2012). Also in 2012 smart phones can stream live HD video in real time over a call. I wonder how much their data plan is? Which, by the way, brought the film from ridiculous to absurd especially given that streaming the video served no purpose in the story or the scene. A speaker phone would have sufficed and my disbelief would not have been called back from suspension. So yeah, those are just TWO of the myriad issues this movie has. This was worse than the remake, by far. There isn't a film maker in the world who could make a good sequel to the original, even Tobe Hooper couldn't do it and HE directed the original. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is a perfect film, it needs no more exposition, but this is the era of the retro cash grab. So everything cool from the 70's and 80's gets dragged out and crapped on for the youth market and they think the winks and nods to the source material will tickle us old fans nostalgia gland. Well screw you Hollywood. It doesn't. It's lazy film making. What I paid 10 bucks for was nothing more than a 1sr draft script chock full of slasher clichés and inept story telling. You know what made the original so brilliant? It wasn't about anything! It was simple, I dare say even plausible. But this movie BEGAN in implausible territory and only sank deeper into the abyss.

Compared to the other films in the TCM franchise it is awesome. I thought the 2nd TCM, leather face, and the next generation were three of the worst films in horror movie history and I would love to hear an argument against that. And the remake and the prequel are not anything special either to me the very first one has carried this franchise. This movie basically says the second, third, and forth movie never happened as bad as I hate those films they are still in the franchise and doing that is just a big slap to the whole story. Again I like this movie better than those three but those three were already made before. There are a lot of plot holes in the movie like how the main character would have been about 40 and she looks like she's in her twenties and how the guy didn't tell her that the house she is inheriting is home to a face wearing, chainsaw wielding murderer. That would of been very important information, also leather face recognizes the girl to be in his family when he sees her scar but how could he of known about that? I thought it happened when the townspeople burned down the house? Then she was taken by the people so how did he see the scar? or even remember it after so many years later if he even did see it. The best thing about the movie is in the beginning when they go back to the old movie briefly and show what happens after sally gets away.

If your a fan of the original I'm sure your going to see this and I apologize you will be just as upset as me. OK so the acting is dreadful and there is no direction for any character accept that they make it so you sort of want to see them get killed because they are terrible people. The movie was filmed in the 70's and the actors look like there in there 20's but they use smart phones... If this was a sequel to the original that would mean that actors would be around there 40's which isn't the case. If they were in there 20's why would they have smart phones!! It is clear that the writers and director of this movie didn't care enough to notice huge problems like that!! This movie almost appeared as if the director wanted it to be so bad it was good, but then you notice the director was actually trying. He failed at making a B movie which actually could have been cool seeing it's laughably bad for the first half hour and everyone in the theater was like, OK this could be fun! NO, THE DIRECTOR FAILED!!! DON""T SEE THIS!! I am going to be one of the first of terrible reviews, it is sad to think it will make it's money back.

Recently, I haven't been impressed with much in the way of newer entries...I really had grown annoyed with the last two Texas Chainsaws (after multiple viewings) and was reluctant to feel too interested in this one when I first heard about it. ...then I got a quick glimpse of Leatherface and had to see it.I decided to resist the temptation of reading the synopsis, watching clips, and reading reviews. I just wanted to see a good scary movie and enjoy myself. Expectations were low.I was immediately caught off guard by the intro and recommend that if it hasn't been ruined for you yet, avoid reading much more on it. Yes, it disregards a lot. But at this point, I really don't care too much...the series has been all over the place anyway. It was a good setup to flash forward and start up a new storyline. I was sick of Hoyt and that family. I was sick of TCM movies with long drawn out scenes of a chick screaming at the dinner table while watching people babble. This was more focused on Leatherface slashing.The characters were fairly likable. There were a few moments where people annoyed me or it dragged a little, but they kept me interested in the plot, and when Leatherface wreaks havoc, it's top-notch.Brutal, scary, all around good use of 3D without being too cheesy... And I found the plot twists unpredictable and fresh.Very happy with this one all around. Highly recommended.By the way, the girlies in this one...A+",Texas Chainsaw

They decide to take a detour to see what's been bequeathed to Heather by a grandmother she didn't know she had.

He does suggest, repeatedly, that Heather read a letter of instruction left to her by her grandmother.She doesn't.Soon the group of friends is exploring the massive mansion, marveling at Heather's good fortune. Dinnertime rolls around, and they decide to head into nearby Newt, Texas, to procure some grub. Daryl volunteers to stay behind ...... and promptly begins stealing stuff the moment they leave.

The hulking horror known as Leatherface, who's been locked in the basement, promptly beats him to death and begins dismembering him with, yes, a chain saw.Freed from his basement confines, Leatherface fires up his steel-toothed appendage once more and begins to unleash another bloodletting as Heather and her friends try-mostly futility-to flee from her grotesque inheritance.That's all very predictable, of course.What isn't so horror movie rote is what happens after Heather learns that she and Leatherface, whose name is Jed Sawyer, are actually cousins ... and that words from her grandmother contained in that letter she neglected to read instruct her to take care of him.
Moreover its a good mix of all the stuff and a good movie to watch.",Texas Chainsaw
232,chris66632,Simply one of the worst films i've ever seen.,1,23 January 2013,"Lets get this out of the way 3D. *sigh* there are 5 bits of 3D in the entire and mercifully short running time, 2 of these are the opening and closing credits. All in total 3D accounts for 15/20 seconds of the actual film. Do not see in 3D.Onto the plot *hahahhaha*, no really. It's virtually non existent.SPOILERS - The main character by the end doesn't even seem to care that leatherface has butchered both her best friend and boyfriend, even the Sheriff doesn't seem to care by the end and lets Leatherface go, despite the fact the whole setup of this film began with him trying to arrest him for multiple murders. Nevermind the fact that leatherface has added to his kill tally by the end. This is all because the film tries to get the audience to sympathise with Leatherface, i'm pretty sure when you're watching a horror film the last thing you want to do is empathise with the killer. Perhaps this is because despite wearing a mask on his face Leatherface gives the most emotive performance out of the entire cast, who are poorly written and whose names I have already forgotten, save for Kenny's but that is only because of ""Oh my god, they killed kenny"" suffice to say the film was written so poorly that even that quote was missed off from the film.In summary, the characters 'act' stupidly throughout, a sure sign of lazy writing, the plot is nonsensical and an insult to the original. I dare say I have spent more time compiling this review, then the writers of this travesty of a movie spent on the so called 'script'. Also when someone tells you to read the letter repeatedly, then surely it is a good idea to read it however then we wouldn't have had to suffer the next 60 minutes of painful viewing. If you're thinking of seeing this film in the hope that it is so bad that it's good, don't it is just a terrible terrible film that isn't even scary. The scariest part of this entire movie experience was the £10 ticket price that i was actually foolish enough to pay in order to witness this piece of crap.",Texas Chainsaw
233,Fectom,Potentially entertaining,5,13 May 2013,"Texas Chainsaw 3D follows the story, which ends at the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but after a short introduction (which pretty much changes the original entirely), about 20 years are skipped and the follow-up of the massacre begins.Although this story has some links, which connect it to the original, it still should not be considered as \""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2\"". Because of the huge time gap between the original and this one, a lot of new characters are introduced and the previously known ones are somewhat altered.But viewing it as a individual, the movie can create diverse opinions:If you happen to look for a scary slasher movie to watch with friends over a bowl of popcorn, then this movie might be for you. It can be entertaining and it does put you to the edge of your seat. You do not need to be familiar with the original: the necessary knowledge will be provided to the viewer as the story proceeds. Take it as a simple movie to make people scared and you will have fun.If you happen to look for a deeper meaning and need the story to be logical and correct, then you will most definitely have a bad time. I tend to look for the flaws in every movie and most often I find them. Therefore the movie itself and the story needs to out-weight the flaws I have found. Unfortunately it didn't. The psychological aspect of this story is far-fetched and didn't convince me at all. Add a serif, who sends out a single policeman, to investigate a multiple murder scene, when the killer is still on the loose, and the story becomes more and more improbable.In the end, the reaction to this movie will come down to the viewer. When not compared to the original and stopping to think logically for 90 minutes, it is an enjoyable slasher movie. But once you start questioning the possibility of it, the movie will easily become a simple campfire story, where every sentence makes you believe it less and less.",Texas Chainsaw
234,zachup,Really could have been better,4,5 January 2013,"This movie was bad, just plain bad. And me being a huge fan of horror films and the Texas Chainsaw series, that's saying a lot. Has bad acting throughout the entire film. I was expecting Trey Songz to die at the hands of Leatherface, he dies in a car crash. The slutty girl who steals her best friend's boyfriend, she dies by accident from getting shot by a cop after scaring him. And let's not even mention the little chase scene featuring the main girl. She would fall over EVERYTHING POSSIBLE, even the smallest fence and Leatherface doesn't even notice her falling which was pretty obvious. The kill scenes were too quick and lame and not imaginative. And at the end, the killer we are meant to be scared of (Leatherface) suddenly becomes a hero at the end after finding out they are cousins. Blah, some of it was good but most of it was lame. It had a strong first half only to be crushed by a dumb second half. The main girl gets rescued too fast only to be kidnapped by the townsfolk JUST BECAUSE she is a Sawyer. I mean, she was only a baby. Not like she inherits the killer's gene right away. This movie's script was bad and the acting was even worse. Don't waste your money and let a good movie like Django Unchained or The Hobbit or Les Miserables stay on top like they should. 4 stars is pretty generous but it did have some cool scenes",Texas Chainsaw
235,bigtimedeck,What I like about this film..,10,28 December 2013,"I loved the original and the 2003 remake so I thought this film would be the same as the original and it wasn't and that's what I like about this film it's not the same as the original they changed it up. I think that if they keep making remakes of the original and they're all the same you know who dies and who lives and at what part which I thing is really boring. What I like about this film is that they changed it so it looked like it was the next film of the Texas Chainsaws. What I like is how Heather (Alexandra Daddario) ended up helping leather-face, she defiantly mixed it up. I like how it was a surprise when we found out she was the cousin of Leather-face really shocked me I would of never guessed she would of help him. I really hope they make more of these movies, like starting their own line of them. I think that if you keep remaking the same movie with the same story-line you will just start getting bored you will know everything that happens but if you keep making the same movie but different story-line it makes the film so more existing and the viewer will have new things to be scared of. How you wont know who dies and what part which is what I find interesting.",Texas Chainsaw
236,alexanderemory11,Nikki (Tania Raymonde),10,4 January 2013,"Nikki was my favorite character of the film and Tania Raymonde's acting was surprisingly impressive. Her confident, rambunctious, and promiscuous personality served as a great foil to Alexandra Daddario's troubled and cynical character, Heather Miller. Her character captures something in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre films that I like the most- the typical, carefree, fun loving American girl. Her highly optimistic attitude and good looks presents the audience with someone they could easily relate to and perhaps see being friends with. That said, the audience is pulled more into the film and a good pace is established. The film really suffers when Nikki is accidentally killed in the end.What did you think about Nikki?",Texas Chainsaw
237,nicmwilliams,Don't waste your time!,1,16 January 2013,"I went into the cinema with pretty low expectations but I was even more disappointed than I thought possible! Opening scene went on for too long to being an 'opening scene' for a start. The storyline throughout is predictable, boring and the usually blood and gore which is squeamish if you have a low tolerance for that type of scene but unrealistic to anyone else. Now-the actors/actresses - wow! Sorry but these people must have dropped out of drama school early - the acting (if you can call it that) was simply talentless. The girls are typical American early twenties wearing skin tight clothes or at least half naked throughout (so basically just a bit of eye candy). The bad guys are easy to spot early on. Your almost routing for everyone to die (good and bad guys) just so the film will hurry up and end. The lame one liners are in this film as well.

239,apis_arefiz,Texas Chainsaw at its worse.,1,1 May 2013,"From my experience, all of the Texas Chainsaw movies are one of the horror gore fest movie where everything is just pure evil. But for this one, named ""Texas Chainsaw 3D"", its just pure garbage. The storyline and the idea is very weak. I can't even describe the positive things in this movie, as everything is just wrong from the start to the finish. As a Leatherface fan, I am disappointed.The intro itself starts of with how ""coincidence"" that Heather is also working in a slaughterhouse just like her biological grandparents are. Which is irrelevant at all. From the start of this movie, you can see all the acting is just pure nonsense. Everything is just wrong in this movie. Not even a strong performance at all by all the actor and actress. For the script, it is just utterly low minded and simple script. Not even a strong build up at all.As for the 3D, well it's just not worth any of your bucks. The movie itself only have 3 or 4 3D scenes which are not worth extra bucks to be honest. First one is the intro,(title of course) like always. The second one is the one which Leatherface threw the chainsaw to the policeman in which the son of Burt. Not even surprise at all. The third one is just one lousy CGI effect where Burt hands is chainsawed and he was killed by a meat grinder. Other than that, I see no reason at all to see this movie in 3D.Overall, this Texas Chainsaw 3D is just disappointing movie. It's not a B movie, it's a C movie, with cheap script, weak acting, and not even a good storyline build up. As for the story, it is very weak. Please, if you're a fan, you will miss the old Leatherface. Because this new one, is just not even the Leatherface the fans want. Putting Leatherface with a tie is just not even near the horror the fans want. The movie itself just not connect with me. To be honest, Alexandra Daddario is one beautiful girl with lovely eyes. But her performances as a main character is just not even close to be a good one. I've rent the movie, and immediately gave it back to the store that I rented because this movie is just so bad.0/5 stars for Texas Chainsaw 3D. - Don't watch it if you like Texas Chainsaw and also good movies.",Texas Chainsaw
240,nickgilmour80,the massacre of this franchise,2,6 January 2013,after hearing pretty good things about this movie i decided to go see it with some friends. biggest mistake of 2013 so far. don't get me wrong the movie starts out great with flashbacks of the original film and then instead of going downhill from there it just flat out falls off a cliff. straight down.there is so much wrong with this movie its hard to find a good place to start. our heroine for one is literally the dumbest girl I've ever seen in a movie. who in their right mind would leave a complete stranger that they just picked up as a hitchhiker alone in a new house? that decision is the smartest choice she makes in the whole movie. another example is when leatherface is chasing her she decides to hide in a coffin. like wtf! why not just keep running? why not hide somewhere where you're not completely trapped if he finds you which everyone knew he was going to. the entire theater was laughing at how stupid this girl was.The ending was by far the worst ending of any horror movie ever made. if you don't want the ending spoiled i suggest stop reading but if you want to save 13 bucks please continue. leatherface is supposed to be one of the top feared horror icons of all time. and they have him get a beatdown by the mayor and have leatherface whimper and curl up in fear? and then the insanely stupid girl save him because she is his cousin? even though she can just totally forive him for killing all of her friends? and then try to get the audience to feel sorry for leatherface? no way not happening.the only reason i give this 2 out of 10 is because trey songz gets killed,Texas Chainsaw
241,kstubby123,"It could of been at most a decent horror film, but failed..",4,4 January 2013,"when i went into theaters to see this i didn't have high expectations, and my feelings were confirmed. the film starts off exactly where the first left off like the promised. the rednecks of the town decide to take things in there own hands and the house and sawyer family are burned and killed. flash forward to whenever, not really sure when but the police had smart phones..anyway the protagonist heather miller finds out she has the inheritance and they go off to Texas. the one problem with this film is that their are the typical group of teens, the jock(trey songz), rebel girl(heather miller), and the slut(heather's friend). the film has its scares and jump scenes but a lot of them are the same scenes, just presented at different angles or locations. the twist in the film is one nobody would guess, heather finds out what happened to her biological family from the townspeople and decides to do something about it which in turn includes her helping leather face out in killing the two townspeople that helped in burning the sawyer family years ago. this ending is what kept the film from sinking even lower. yes it is kinda sick that the protagonist decides to take care and house the main killer but it gives us a interesting point of view of what being family means. this film has a few nice tributes to the film, one being what happens to heathers friend and how, and that leather face is still doing what he does best. i left the theater feeling okay, not jumping up cheering. if u look at the film as a fun, scary, gore fest..u will be okay leaving the theater. don't plan on anything to wow you, because it most likely wont.",Texas Chainsaw

Even thou the story is kinda predictable. The gore 10/10 like when the time when the girls head get shoot off or when Leatherface is putting his new mask together. I strongly suggest that you go see this 3D at your local theater because it makes it more scary. This movie also will make you jump a few times.Once the chainsaw starts you will moving in your seat and you will be scared out of your mind.

It's an entertaining movie nonetheless...just don't expect much horror...couple of jumpy scenes but most of the movie gave me the ""Why the hell would you do that...?"" and ""OMG...wow..."". Don't want to give anything away in the movie so you won't know what I mean until you see the movie, but I laughed throughout most of this movie.

We all know that horror movies are better in the dark, but... when she says : ''My friends are killed a few hours ago''. I started to think... A few hours is more then 3... from the beginning they arrive its dark. So how long is their night?! It starts of with a creepy bone painting, this was my first clue that she was related to Leatherface, no one, and I mean no one fantasizes of a bone painting. She receives a letter saying her grandma died, which lived in the house where Leatherface lives as well, clue number 2. She and her friends go visit the house because her grandmother left it to her. The first one dies immediately and there was no element of surprise. Before you know everyone dies. He cheates with the blond girl and Heather doesn't even notice it? While they walked half-naked out of the barn.. oke, maybe thats my critic that when you get chased by a chainsaw you don't think of those kind of things, so my apologie. Soon you notice almost everyone are involved with the massacre and thats it. There is no element of surprise and you can see everything coming. Oh wait, my bad, I didn't see her hanging on a fairy wheel without falling, that was just hilarious.I must say, that its kind of new. To make the two maincharachters ( heather and leatherface... how convenient, they should call them Heatherface ) related to each other.

245,nushed_kruts1,An Interesting Addition to the Franchise!,8,14 January 2013,"So, at the weekend I went to see the new Texas Chainsaw 3D movie! Here is my review of it: From the outset, it is clear that they decided to completely skip the story lines from all but the original 1974 film and bring it up to date as a ""40 years later"" type plot. I felt that due to all the character introductions and story line the action took a bit longer than I'd like to get going, but at the same time I found it understandable. The overall atmosphere and feel of the film is not as dark as the 2002 (supposed) remake and it's sequel, ""The Beginning"" but that did not take away or add anything to the film, but did make a nice change to see a more ""brighter"" picture than the usual darkness you get nowadays with most horror films. The story line is easy to follow with very few surprises and twists, following, pretty much, the standard Texas Chainsaw formula, though with a slightly different take on the ending and whilst may be considered a twist, is one that is easily guessable throughout the movie. The special effects are quite cool with some good death scenes, though disappointingly, the 3D aspect did not add anything to the special effects and would work just as well in 2D with no difference in feel or impact! One of the things that I liked the most is what they have done with the Leatherface character! They have clearly aged the character which does give an interesting twist to the character and also, they have humanized him some what too, making him not only this psychopathic, chainsaw wielding monster, but also a more deeper, complex character that makes the audience step back and see him, not in a different way, but a more fuller, expanded view and understanding. I must say that the ending of the film felt a little rushed and could have perhaps done with an extra 5/10 minutes of film time to smooth it out better, though, I'm happy to say, has left itself open to a sequel and, if done right, could tie up this film nicely. At the end of the day, it IS, after all, a Texas Chainsaw movie, and in that role, it fills it role adequately, and whilst there are better films in the Chainsaw franchise, it is also much better than half of them too. Did, I enjoy it enough to warrant me buying the DVD and seeing it again? Hell yeah! Despite its shortcomings, I did thoroughly enjoy this new installment of the Texas Chainsaw franchise and certainly deserves it's place within the Texas Chainsaw franchise!",Texas Chainsaw

247,JazzyC20,Best Chainsaw Movie Yet!,8,5 June 2013,"Spoiler Alert ahead. You have been Warned.I was a excited yet wary when it was announced there would be a Texas Chainsaw 3D. I loved Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning fell in love with all the characters, story-line, and plot. Texas Chainsaw 3D was more then I expected. Positive: Highlights from the original movie are at the beginning, makes the movie way more likable in my opinion but then again it made me hate the whole movie on how Leather face COULD have saved baby-Heather but no that didn't happen, as much as I wanted it to. Fast pace, action packed, Gory scenes. Alexandra Daddario. She was outstanding in this movie, aced the part perfectly!Had me laughing when everyone died. Really got this series back onto its feet, I can't wait for the sequel. Negatives: The ending, I loathed the ending, I have watched it ten times now just to make sure I didn't miss any deleted scenes or extras, it makes me mad that it ended that way. A good question that I still don't understand, are theses family members from another part of Texas, or somewhere else in the world? Why weren't they mentioned in the first two movies? Or better yet in Texas Chainsaw Massacre:The Beginning? It's a plot hole that must be filled. How did he survive when Grandma died? This would make more sense if the lawyer came and unlock the door to feed him but the door was locked and the food was dried up. So I'm going to ASSUME he had human bodies down there to eat. The cops really need to be more realistic when it comes to movies like this, WHY would you Leave evidence out so someone else can look through it? Makes no sense, they could steal something, hell I would have taken the box with me if I was in Heather's position.Overall Rating would be an eight because I love it THAT much, even if there were some minor plot holes and mistakes.",Texas Chainsaw

Leatherface was as usual great, the makeup was good he was scary and gave no one mercy when he was after them.

250,LadyYoureScaringUs,The Only Good Part...,1,4 January 2013,"The only good part in this film was seeing Sally break through the window in 3D. This film was a HUGE disappointment. The second with Jordana Brewster did a much better job with the back story and this was a rip-off of Halloween and that. BUT WHY DO THEY THINK BABIES + COSMETIC COUNTER + FAMILY SENTIMENT = GOOD HORROR? The originals were good without all the crappy history trying to make sense of it all for a reason. Adding some hillbilly family with an infant is so predictable and was done in the 2003 remake. Laurie Strode never teamed up against Loomis with Michael when she realized she was his blood. The family back story thing has been done and in my opinion has helped any. I knew Marilyn Burns had a cameo, so I was hoping for some weird twist...Maybe Heather's grandmother wasn't who she claimed to be or something and Sally would appear some how...I just wanted to be surprised about something!I felt the reason the original TCM was so amazing was the feeling of being stranded in the middle of nowhere, not knowing why this Leatherface guy was crazy, etc. It was simply scary on its own. The 2003 remake ruined the original the same way Rob Zombie did with his Halloween remake. I don't want to feel bad for the character because of his childhood. The whole movie was Swiss cheese with plot holes, so I did not expect the ending to tie together anything. But I did expect some decent scares and received none. The chase scenes were not a bit suspenseful. The audience was laughing 90% of the time, which is NEVER GOOD. Maybe I have seen too many horror movies and have become too critical, but this was the biggest waste of money. I basically paid to watch a lackluster diagonal chainsaw pop out occasionally.

252,chrisszaroleta,Second best installment in the franchise. Easily,10,4 January 2013,"I should preface my following review of Texas Chainsaw 3D by making sure you are all aware that this review is coming from someone whose expectations of this film were nothing less than extreme. At the same time, unless the movie was complete and total garbage, there's no way I could have walked away unhappy. The casual viewer may feel differently. I'll also leave out spoilers, which is good because you should fill in the holes when you go see it!The film opens by paying homage to the original. Spliced in scenes from Tobe Hooper's classic set us up for the film to come. Side note: You have to understand, this is a DIRECT SEQUEL to the original. It doesn't begin following 1990's Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, It has NOTHING to do with 1994's atrocity starring Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughey (we won't speak its name), it doesn't follow anywhere in the timeline of the 2003 Marcus Nispel franchise reboot starring Jessica Biel or its 2006 prequel, nor is it a standalone remakeit's a sequel. A true sequel. 1986 brought us The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, a hokey, over-the-top 80's slasher that was more comical than it was scary. Though it's a fun movie viewing experience, especially for us hardcore fans, it's not the gritty, no holds barred sequel that the original deserved. Texas Chainsaw 3D is. From the stock footage, we cut not to modern day, but the same day in '74 after Sally has escaped the clutches of the insidious Sawyer family and has gone for help. We see the sheriff and townspeople descend upon the Sawyer house, at which point we're provided a couple awesome cameos from Chainsaw films past, with more to come throughout. Essentially, they shoot and torch the Sawyer clan..almost entirely. Now we cut to modern day! From here, the focus turns to a young woman who's just received a communication that she's inherited a house from a grandmother she never knew she had. Thus begins the road trip to Texas to claim the rights to the property. Horror ensues. From here, the movie takes the fairly typical turn of eventspeople in their 20's start getting picked off one by one by masked villain. Of course, it's different because we're talking about Leatherface! He's there in all of his flesh-wearing, chainsaw-wielding glory. I'll give it a gore level of 7/10. We certainly could have used more killsalways can, but the ones we did get were bloody and fun (this is why we enjoy the genre, right?). Plus, we have to keep in mind that, despite the misconceptions surrounding the original's gore level, only one victim died by the saw. The film's overall tone is darkgood cinematography and an appropriate score lend to that. The acting is well it's a horror movie, folks! No one's walking away with an Oscar nomination. The cast did do a respectable job, including star Alexandra Daddario, but especially Leatherface newcomer Dan Yeager. Pulling off decent acting chops without dialog or the use of your facial expressions is no simple feat. He does so splendidly. The end of the film provides a nice twistwhat did you expect, it's a Lionsgate and Twisted Pictures production, the same companies that brought us the Saw franchiseof course there's a plot twist! A good one. One that I knew was coming, was unsure of my feelings toward, but ended up loving.The film accomplished many things in my eyes, but most of all, it's provided a valid outlet for the franchise to live on. Aside from Dracula/vampire movies (Twilight doesn't count, people), at 38 years strong, this is the oldest, active horror franchise today. Another accomplishment of this installment is the humanizing of Leatherface. The 2003 and 2006 movies made him more mythical than humanWAY over-the-top. I won't deny a couple plot holes. I won't deny that things I would have liked to have seen weren't included and vice versa, but it was truly good and for a fan of the franchise, a masterpiece of cinema (as much as horror allows for). Go see it, but REALLY know the storyline of the original first. If you go in having only seen Jessica Biel run half topless through a slaughterhouse (and it enjoyed it), this might not be for you. As for the 3D, use your discretion. If you like the novelty, go for it. If you could care less, save the extra $2.

Let me just state where I come from before seeing this movie. For my money, the best Chainsaw film is the 2003 re-imagining. It is one of the rare remakes that surpasses the original in my opinion. I respect the original and while it's a good film, it doesn't have the atmosphere and tension of the 2003 re-imagining (not to mention the killer stylish cinematography). I loathed the 2006 prequel. It was a little too disturbing for my taste and by the time you reached the end of the movie, there was no light at the end of the tunnel. I saw the 1986 Tobe Hooper sequel a long time ago in the days of VHS but I remember appreciating what they had tried to do. An average film though. I never saw Parts III (1990) and IV (1994) nor do I care to.Now let's talk about this new chapter in the saga; they've sort of rebooted the franchise in a way. This one's a direct sequel to the original 1974 film. We are treated to a cool 3D recap of the events of the 1974 film in the opening scenes then taken to a shootout taking place immediately after the first film ends. This new movie takes the franchise in a completely different direction and has a very cool Gothic flavor to it. They chartered new territory and I found myself rooting for Leatherface (something I never thought I'd do). It's not a masterpiece but it's a nice throwback to the slashers of the golden age of the '80s.My only gripe is the screwed up time-line they played with; the events from the first film took place in 1973, yet in present day, the little girl is all grown up and in her twenties (when she should be 40 something) and it clearly takes place in 2012 (see Verna's tombstone). I think that's why they never state that the beginning of the film takes place in the '70s because for the sake of continuity, they probably made it so that the opening takes place in 1993 instead or somewhere around that time. No biggie.I read somewhere that they want to pop out a Chainsaw film every year if this one is successful. That'd be great. It would be a nice change of pace from the pointless Paranormal Activity movies they churn out every Halloween. Love the new direction. Looking forward to revisiting it on Blu-ray. Don't believe the mostly negative reviews floating on the Web; it's a lot of fun and the 3D was good too. Highly recommended.",Texas Chainsaw

The main character is a 22 to 23 year old female who was given up for adoption by the Sawyer family over 30 years ago from the plot in the sequal.

259,jpweatherly,Travesty,1,5 January 2013,"Everyone seems to have done a thorough job pointing out the continuity errors in this film. There are plenty of them to discuss. More of the errors were egregious and could have easily been dealt with. What I have not heard from anyone is how this movie is not technically (legally) related to the others in anyway. The producers obviously didn't pay for the rights to the franchise in order to make this garbage heap. 1. The name/word ""Leatherface"" is never used in the movie at all. Not once. Its probably trademarked. 2. Leatherface's real name from the original is not ""Jed Sawyer,"" its Thomas Hewitt. Again, they probably would've had to pay for that. 3. The name of the film does not include ""Massacre,"" which they would've also had to pay for. I guess they could hire Gunnar Hansen and Bill Moseley and claim this was part of the catalog, but its not. I'm sure the rights to the story/characters/etc would not be cheap. I think this could've been done well even by dancing around some of these issues.The story itself stunk and was full of gaping holes. The timing of it all could've easily been dealt with if it was set in the early 90s. If Leatherface was 20 in 1974, he'd be 58 in 2012. I have a hard time believing a 58-year old man is running around with a chainsaw. Also, Heather would be pushing 40 by now. I can deal with sub par actors and even sub par dialog (""Do your thing, cuz!"" - awful), but this movie was completely half-assed from the jump.Also, 3D is worthless. It was only used in 3-4 scenes and was totally unnecessary. It did nothing but double the price of my ticket.I'm a huge fan of the original and have been since I was a child. This movie was a lazy effort from all angles. It seems like a few extra hours of thought and a few extra bucks could've made this awful piece of garbage at least bearable.We were all ripped off.",Texas Chainsaw
260,greycomics-1,An Excess Devoid of Thought or Merit,1,6 January 2013,"Beyond all the pink-cheeked, bated-breath laudation that has come from critics and horror aficionados in the 38 years since the release of the original film, it's not a stretch to say that the two things that worked together so effectively in the execution of the original was the stark, naturally-lit and flat documentarian style of cinematographer Daniel Pearl and the sparse writing of Hooper and Henkel, whose utter lack of exposition lend a terrifying, claustrophobic immediacy in counterpoint to sun-baked Southern Gothic vistas, which place the viewer squarely and unremittingly in role of Hitchcock's man filming in the corner, with all of the legendary director's flinch-inducing atmospherics and not of whit of his restraint, such as it was.With so much latitude in which to effect a direct sequel (apparently given a seal of approval by Hooper, undoubtedly for monetary incentive and despite his directing a direct sequel in 1986), with so little to hamper questions of plot or motivation, Texas Chainsaw 3D fails so completely and morosely that one might wonder for whom the film was even made, for it definitely was not for a viewer with any sense of taste or even the ability to do basic arithmetic.It is generally understood that the events of the first film take place in 1973 or '74. Once this film left the confines of those few brief sequences which dovetail immediately from the end of original, in which a lynch mob and the most ineffectual sheriff ever are party, directly or indirectly, to picking off the entire Sawyer clan to which Leatherface is kin, and then burning the farmhouse to the ground, and a member of the mob inexplicably taking the lone babe of family home to raise as his own, we skip, by all accounts of vernacular, media, and what little of civilization we see before plunging back into the wilds of rural Texas, to be modern day; a tombstone later in the film confirms that the year is in fact 2012. From this, we must conclude one of two things: Heather Miller (the now grown-up Sawyer child from the intro, played by a disturbingly thin Alexandra Daddario) is either the youngest looking 40-year-old heroin chic store butcher (as heavy-handed a nod to the nature vs. nurture debate as I've seen in film since being lampooned in Trading Places) in the history of cinema, or people were picking up retarded hitchhikers in VW bugs while wearing bare-backed polyester fashions of the seventies sometime between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Rodney King riots. So far is this discrepancy from being explained that all reference to the date of the original film's events are limited to ""August 19th"" with the year consistently being deliberately obscured.The rest of the cast is equally unremarkable in presence and abysmal in performance, from the Tonia Raymonde shedding her more tame bad-girl image from ABC's absurd Switched at Birth series to become the requisite slutty slasher-bait, inexplicably involved in a love triangle, never exposed or explained beyond its smarmy, innuendo-laced exposition, with Heather's boyfriend, played by Trey Songz, included no doubt in an attempt to add urban flair and coax minority viewers that are probably sick of seeing Caucasian kids lumber around stupidly and getting fileted in the dark woods.The greatest disservice to the original material was the ridiculous attempt, by way of the Sawyer family slaughter at the beginning and the near single-minded thuggery of the lead vigilante, now serving as the town's mayor, to make Leatherface and company sympathetic characters, even swinging for the anti-hero fences when the bloodthirsty mayor meets his boring and contrived ending. Were the mayor and his retinue of good old boys terrible people for mowing down a slew of people and burning the house to ash with Molotov cocktails? Undoubtedly. But we should not forget those people were part of an inbred family of murdering, cannibal sadists, something that no amount of rural oppression can allow any sane person to ignore.The film exists for the same reason that the sequel to the Blair Witch Project was released: to produce a sexualized, tangential story with hot young actors in a shameless attempt to cash in on a franchise name. At least Book of Shadows attempted a story even if it was a terrible one. Avoid this one, unless you have enough morbid fascination to see both the death of a franchise's self-respect, and one torn button-down shirt which maintained its wearer's modesty purely by proving that one of the few forces in nature greater than gravity is a non-nudity clause.",Texas Chainsaw
261,goldug,"Predictable, full of clichés, but surprisingly satisfying.",6,3 October 2013,"(Marking as spoiler alert just to avoid the nitpickers out there. There are no spoilers really.)It was ... good. There are definitely better movies of course. I did not like the cliché that when someone runs from the horror they must stumble and so. A little too predictable, albeit the end surprised me a little (very little). Another thing I did not like (and here's where I'm going away from my stereotypical manliness) was that the only two women who were in focus had - of course - big breasts and too little clothing. Unrealistically so. The film has a lot of eye candy for ""men"" in general (rather immature men and boys).The weirdest things about the breasts and the clothes was that no matter what, the ""most important"" (according to USA's censors anyway) parts of the breasts were always covered. It did not matter how little clothing it was, they managed to unnaturally constantly cover the breasts when anyone with a little brain power KNOW well enough that they would pop out from under the clothes.The lead woman obviously cannot even put on a shirt properly, she snaps only ONE button that covers the essentials, while the rest flutters around when she runs.So, to summarize, it's a predictable film with clichés and immature teasing eye candy, but still worth seeing, if only for the end.",Texas Chainsaw

However the movie isn't scary, it has a couple jump parts but overall pretty tame. And the the ending is super predictable. So pretty much, if you like gory movies with bad endings this is the one for you. If you are going to genuinely be scared i'd recommend choosing another one.Scary? No. Gory? yes.

265,YouCanCallMeJoe,Not as amazing as it should have been.,3,4 January 2013,"Maybe I'm just too hard on judging horror films, but Texas Chainsaw 3D wasn't as good as it should have been. Of course, the potential was there. I mean, how hard is it to make a story about a killer with a chainsaw who wears peoples' faces as a mask scary? Pretty terrifying if you ask me. I loved the nods to the original 1974 version, but the clichés and last half of the story left me unsatisfied. Now I know it's hard for a horror movie not to fall into some amount of clichés, but how hard is it not to make your main character trip over almost everything she is running over? It was also obvious Trey Songz was just in it for marketing purposes. I honestly saw no point to his character other than having him be there for Leatherface's slaughtering.Even though he wasn't even killed by Leatherface. As for the last half of the story, Heather finds out she is cousins with Leatherface and all of a sudden decides she is not afraid of him? I'm sorry but if I were to find out my cousin was a chainsaw-wielding maniac killer, I wouldn't stay around to care for him. Even if the crazy townspeople were trying to kill us both. Overall, it was not as tense or scary as the original or 2003 remake. (Yes, I enjoyed the remake. No judgment!)It had its parts of gore and horror moments, but something about it just didn't satisfy me. I was left with mixed feelings.

Overall id give it a B rating. and some of the acting isn't all poor. alexandria daddiro and trey songz did pretty good... scott eastwood did great for a small part. and the others... ehh. oooh and if you miss marilyn burns then shes back for a small part. so if i was you.. i woud buckle up for an amazing thrill ride! i wouldn't take any kids younger than 15 though.",Texas Chainsaw

All i had was my gut feeling, and that was that this movie was going to....well to suck to be quite frankly, luckily i was pleasantly surprised! Judging by the trailers only my impression was that this was going to be another boring and cliché slasher flick and a lot of people would most likely argue that it still is and i can understand why, however i am a big fan of the series and by definition the original movie so watching a movie which is a direct sequel to the original was quite the treat for me.Going back to the ""boring slasher"" bit, this movie has some of those cliché slasher shticks, like the characters for example, such as the jock, the slut and so on, but what i liked about this movie is that it plays a bit with your expectations and actually takes some of these clichés and flips them around.The film also has a rather interesting ending, which you will see coming relatively early on if you have half a brain cell, and this ending is one of those endings that you either love or you hate so make of that what you will.Final verdict, if you like some of the other Chain saw movies and can forgive a thing or two about the movie then your in for a good and entertaining movie!

Not so beautiful Leatherface (but scary enough and sufficiently well played by Dan Yeager). 3. Attempt to meaningful story (although with some plot holes). 4. Direct sequel of the original. 5. Some familiar faces from the past of Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Some of those paragraphs work, some do not. The script could have been better. Some scenes was unnecessary. Some other things - too... True, the film is not perfect. This does not matter. The purpose of the Texas Chainsaw 3D is to be funny. And it is fun. Acting is good enough. The story may not be worthy of Academy Award, but at least exists. We have blood. We have a chainsaw. We have beautiful girls. 3D was good. That is enough. I must admit that I'm not a big fan of the original movie (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). The only film in the entire franchise that I really liked was the 2003 remake directed by Marcus Nispel and maybe that's why I liked so much Texas Chainsaw 3D. Despite generally negative reviews, the film is not bad. In fact, it is better than most modern horror movies. I think the main reason for all this negativity was too high expectations from the fans of the franchise. Yes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a legendary series, but they are still simply slashers, not Kubrick films.I give the movie 8 out of 10 and the second on my list of slashers, which looks like this: 1.

But I'm also not one of those to shoot down every movie due to it not being the original as well. I gave this a shot. Went in expecting a sub-par Chainsaw and was blown away at how far off I was. Far, far worse. The acting at times is horrible, The chase scenes were overdone with tripping and falling over nothing to the point you couldn't help but laugh, the gore looked completely unrealistic and dramatically overdone. Story wise, there isn't much that can be said without giving away some things, but lets just say it does not flow well at all. People go from being victim to sympathetic within minutes. The film in itself is simply all over the place. As others have stated, it is obvious this was made simply for the dollars. If not, I feel terrible this was a serious attempt at a quality film by the director and writers. Throw together a story over night, toss in a well known star, slap on a popular film title and people will pay because of it. That is exactly what happened here. Their use of the original film to grab the die hard audience, only to make a joke out of the entire film is almost an insult. If you're a Chainsaw fan, I can't tell you to not go see it. It's a must for any true fan. I WILL tell you I do not recommend it. To anyone.",Texas Chainsaw
284,lionheart_booking,Better than everyone's saying it is!,8,13 January 2013,"This movie is MUCH better than everyone is making it out to be. Though, I can see where they're coming from, it's definitely NOT as bad as they're saying. It starts out with a recap of some past killings, which immediately lets you know what you're in for. Then swiftly moves to somewhat of a shoot out, starting off the movie at a fast pace. Once they get to the house, there is probably 20 minutes of down time before it gets savage. The killings may not be as brutal as the originals, but some people may like that more, which is why I think it's getting a bum rap. People are let down because its not as gross, but to many people that's a good thing. I like gore, but I didn't mind it being less gross. That being said, it's still very gross and has some limb-tearing and face cutting, and obviously some body's chipped with the famous chainsaw. It keeps you at the edge of your seat until the very end. There is a pretty cool plot twist, but for the sake of not spoiling it, it kind of turns around quickly and leather face turns in to even more of a bad ass. Now I definitely liked the old ones, but this one is less of a boring gore fest that grosses me out the whole time, and more of a story line based horror flick without getting rid of the cover-your-eyes gore.. Why would anyone want to see the same film over and over? Well, they definitely changed it up. With all that being said, PLEASE go in to this with an open mind! Don't go in and expect the same TCM you have seen before, because you will be disappointed and complain. Instead, realize that this is just a different (but not bad, just different) brand of TCM. It's got all the gore, but this time actually has a back story, a cool twist, and a set up for new movies to follow that will just get better. Trust me, it has all the gore, and you won't see the ending coming at all. Lets just say, leather face makes a new friend..",Texas Chainsaw

What proves it, is its done in 3D like every other piece of sh*t to attract attention from every idiot with the money to afford a movie ticket. And that clip after the credits?

The whole film is stupid. There is one scene where leather the faggot starts drilling into a coffin with the girl in then stops to chase these other 2 people and jumps over a fence like a spastic. And the ending is terrible, the girl saves leather because its her cousin but he murdered her friends... WHAT THE HELL Then he goes home and lives in the basement and the girl brings him chippy and he has a game of ultimate team then goes bed. Then the girl says to him do your thing cuz.

289,pryan-pr,A Fun and Entertaining Sequel,10,11 January 2013,"Ignoring all the sequels, remake and prequel, this movie is a true sequel to the original movie, picking up exactly where it ended. The story follows the townspeople killing every last member of the Sawyer family, leaving a innocent baby alive. Then twenty years later that baby grows up to be Heather Miller who discovered that she is adopted and has inherited a house in Texas. So she travels to Texas with a group of friends, only to discover that Leatherface is living there. Let the bloody carnage begin. I really enjoyed this movie because it was an entertaining slasher movie, that has a pretty good story line, which leads to the shocking twist at the end. Also the best sequel in the franchise by far. If you are considering watching this, don't take it seriously and just enjoy the fun ride. Highly recommend for hardcore Slasher movie fans.",Texas Chainsaw
290,atinoco9278,Surprisingly interesting sequel,7,3 January 2013,"This movie opened a day early here in Puerto Rico. While I didn't think it was on the level of the original, it was certainly superior to any of the Texas Chainsaw films that came after the original. I hated the remake because other than the scene where the hitch hiker blew her brains out, the majority of the film carbon copied the big kills of the original film. This movie simply paid nods to the original but did its own thing.To try to humanize Leatherface but still maintain his terror was a smart and worthwhile thing to do. This movie pretends the sequels ever happened like Halloween H20 did and that may have been the right thing to do but perhaps its a bit of a cheat. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed the direction that this movie took and found it reasonably suspenseful and always interesting.",Texas Chainsaw
291,srichardson868,Ehhhhh,7,3 January 2013,"It is what you would expect it to be when going in bloody, murder, and jumpy. It had me jump a few times but i thought the ending was hard to understand I didn't quite get if she was going to stay or leave. But i don't wanna ruin it. All and all it was worth my money friends all agreed. Its interesting and being a big fan of those movies I am happy. The 3d adding to it was absolutely great I thought (if you didn't have to wear those dumb glasses) but it deff made the movie more interesting. Cons: Actors could have been better, more creative with the killing it was kind of predictable who was going to die. Also some things in the movie really defined logic like the letter thing and how she threw it off didn't make sense. Pros: Had me jump a couple of times, help understand the other chainsaw movies, and also good graphics i love the 3d",Texas Chainsaw
292,philliptyrese,I loved it.,8,5 January 2013,"Look, Now some this is my opinion. I loved it. Mostly the 3D parts. You have different thoughts then other people so you might disagree. But I think you should watch this movie. Especially in 3D it has great scenes!:) SPOILER ALERT! At the end Heather is being taken to a meat factory. The cop ties her up. Leatherface then sees her and almost kills her. But sees Heather is a Sawyer and Leatherface does not kill he because they are cousins. Here's when I started feeling bad, other cops arrive and almost kills Leatherface. Heather makes a run but turns around and kills the cops and saves Leatherface. Now... I started to think in my head WTH? I feel bad for someone almost killing a brutal serial killer. When you think in Friday the 13th or Nightmare on elm street. Your like ""Kill HIM"" but in this movie it was family. Leatherface only killed Heather's friend because he only wanted to protect her. So.... Yeah.",Texas Chainsaw

I found myself laughing, quite often, throughout the movie. And that corny line at the end? You know, when Heather coos to Leatherface: ""Do your thing, cuz."" I just about walked out of there. The only thing that kept me from leaving was my $13 spent on the ticket. I wished I'd remembered what I was taught in Economics 101--my ticket was as sunk cost--because the movie was even worse after that scene!If you're looking for a good scare, stay far away from this one.

294,sikx6,People are far too critical,9,5 January 2013,"Skimming over the past few reviews all I have seen is bad review after bad review. I get so sick of people harping on remakes and new additions as if the new movie takes anything away from the old movie. That's absolutely ridiculous. Even if the remake/addition is terrible they are completely separate movies. They may share a title and some common characters but that is it. The original will still be the same regardless of what comes after it.Either way, this movie is fantastic. I went in with high expectations because I was thrilled that the franchise wasn't dead and it didn't disappoint. A brand new spin on things with all the gore you could ask for. Anyone who says this movie is no good is either too dumb to understand why it played out as it did or still suckling on the teet of the theory that the remakes/sequels should follow the exact same path that a completely different director/set of writers/cast/etc. took almost 40 years ago. There is no bigger fan/critic of TCM movies and I loved this movie. The only reason it didn't get 10 out of 10 from me is because of the short length. But maybe I'm just upset that I didn't get to watch Heather for longer...lol GD movie communists.",Texas Chainsaw
295,megdomes92,So Disappointed.,3,5 January 2013,"Being the extremely huge Leatherface fan that I am, I have been looking forward to seeing this movie since the first posters came out. Literally have been counting down the days. I rushed to the theater on opening night super excited because the Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D facebook page shared a lot of information about the making of the movie and I expected it to be the best one yet. HOWEVER....I was so unbelievably disappointed in this movie it sickens me.If someone didn't know anything about the previous TCM movies, they would think this was just your everyday horny teenager horror movie. I believed that the TCM movies were always better than that, but now my opinion has changed.The movie started out good, and had some good background information to later understand the present scenes. However, once we met the main characters of the movie it was obvious that it wasn't going to meet my expectations. And the fact that Trey Sonz was in this movie(even though his acting skills WERE better than I expected) totally ruined it for me. Also the makers of the movie made a huge error with the the main character's age (should be at least 40.) The killings were not that severe, the only 3D parts were with the chainsaw (which didn't even happen that much), and Leatherface was turned into this sweet character that you began to feel bad for. And don't even get me started on how Heather was acting at the end of the movie.The whole story line was completely changed. During the first half of the movie it is just like the other TCM movies, but the last half turns into some weird love/family reuniting story which I absolutely hated. Plus the other movies really portrayed the fact that the movie was based off a true story. This new TCM makes it seem more like a fantasy horror movie. It's all just very confusing and makes me feel like a woman with a glass of wine wrote the story line.See for yourself if you like but if you are a die hard TCM fan like I WAS, then I highly expect you to be disappointed and don't spend money on it. Thank god I got movie theater gift cards for Christmas...",Texas Chainsaw
296,soulless527,Doesn't make sense and inaccurate,3,5 January 2013,"First I am a huge fan of Texas Chainsaw.....I have watched them all, many times. To change Thomas Hewitt as the killer was a joke!! If you know who Jed is technically he didn't like to kill to begin w/....He was a child of one of the Hewitts victims. In the remake he helped them escape the Hewitt home. Then in the remake novel, was killed by Leatherface for doing it. So how do you make him the killer of the new one? In the original 70s movie there was the 2 Sawyer brothers, the old grand father and Leatherface in the house at the end...well where did all the other people come from in the new one?They changed the last name in the remakes to hewitt. The mask was a joke in the new one also..come on!!! Thats what leather face is all about....cutting people up and some for their face. It looked like brown play dough. And for you people that still think this is based on a true story of a guy that ran around w/ a chainsaw killing people in Texas...its not..its based off of actual events w/ a twist....Its based off of the Ed Gein story....He did sick stuff w/ skin and bones after the death of his mother and they made the movies from what he did....I think they made this movie to get a quick buck...It wasn't worth my 40$! Nice try but you cant compare to the remakes of the movies....personally i think the original sucked too..for what they had back then i give them credit but the new ones are the best. My favorite being the beginning.....don't waste your money, wait for it to come on TV",Texas Chainsaw
297,angelahilton3794,Not given enough credit!!!,9,14 January 2013,"First I must say that I read all the reviews here and as I said in the summary the movie isn't given enough credit. Yes there are a few inaccurate details but upon going to see the movie we enjoyed it. The twisted story line and the ending are very good. I like how they kinda changed the position of leather face from the bad guy to almost a sort of victim role. It was pretty clever if you ask me. I'm not saying its the best because only the original will have the true effect on you, but its much better than the remake and I was happy to see that they didn't stick with the name changed to Hewitt instead of sawyer, not sure why that was even changed to begin with. Overall the movie was good and its one that ill be adding to my collection. Another thing that's been bothering me, all the negative reviews talking about how its worse than the remakes I must ask if the people making the comments if they realize that this movie is supposed to be a sequel to the original not another remake in the series",Texas Chainsaw
298,mrmanhattan22,Third time is the charm... But was it?,1,14 January 2013,"Well I can't say that I was particularly looking forward to this movie after the previous two predecessors. However as a horror fan and Texas Chainsaw Massacre fan, I convinced myself that I must do this and sat through the movie. I had no fun or any kind of entertainment in this movie and throughout the movie, I wasn't thinking about how I wasted my money, no, I was thinking about how a company can see fit to remake this concept once more and for the third time, do a horrible job. The plot was pointless, the acting was very weak and unbelievable, but the expectations should not be as high as they are all young scream queens. The fact that the singer Trey Songs was in this film was super hilarious as I would have never guessed that he would even think about trying to do acting and more so acting in a horror movie. The 3D was a also very disappointing and brought no good for this failure and just made irrelevant and unnecessary. Overall, this movie was not great and if your reading this to try to gain a bit of interest and enthusiasm to go and see this film you won't find it as it is purely a waste of time and you should wait for it to come on your cable TV.",Texas Chainsaw
299,danielb8682,Great reboot/ sequel,8,18 January 2013,"For a Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel from the original series, I was not expecting a good movie. Most of the sequels were just more watered down. This one had a great start, the script was decent, not too camp and funny as some have been (Eg Texas Chainsaw The Next Generation). It held the suspense of when Leatherface will be out with his saw, it had a decent enough storyline, and while leaving it open for another film - it was the first sequel to follow the first movie well. Texas 2 with Dennis Hopper was a mess, sure it had its' moments but it was a mess. This film had a decent enough cast (Shaun Sipos, enough said!) - and it kept me enthralled for the 90ish minutes. Plenty of gore without going over the top, I think this movie is quite underrated, quite disappointed to see the reviews on here. I have seen recently Texas 1-4, and this one is the only one to properly connect the end of Texas 1 - with a result that was more likely than the family just getting away with murder for several stupid sequels. Due to the Michael Bay reboot, I was very skeptical - but don't listen to reviews, if you like Texas and Leatherface as he is meant to be, quiet, mind of a child, and enjoy the family storyline, check it out. It's worth it! It's definitely not a Platinum Dunes/ Michael Bay reboot at all... I would consider Texas Chainsaw 3D the only film to compliment the original. Loved the cameos from some of the original cast, as well as one or two from the second movie.",Texas Chainsaw
300,riosyesenia47,waist of money,1,19 January 2013,"no words can even describe how terrible this ""movie"" was. my god I'm so annoyed i cant believe i waisted money on something so STUPID. this movie doesn't even deserve ONE star thats how awful it is. save your time and money. the line ""do your thing Cuz"" should say it all. not only that, the ""heroes"" in the movie suddenly become the bad guys at the end, like seriously WTF?? this movie is a complete joke! I'm a huge fan of trey songs but after watching this i cant ever look at him the same. honestly the movie isn't even scary it only made me jump because it caught me by surprise at times but other than that the whole time i was watching i was thinking ""you cant be serious FML"" LOL i feel bad for myself.",Texas Chainsaw
301,ryan2197,Good for a sequel.,7,20 January 2013,"As we are all aware, it is hard to achieve the same success with a sequel compared to the original film. Texas Chainsaw 3D carries on for the 1974 version and acts like the other films from the franchise existed...The film is very entertained and is 'gory. Dan Yeager for fills the role of Leatherface very well and is a due credit to this film. His ability he ensures to the role is up to the standard of Gunnar Hansen in the original movie. However, nothing will ever come close to the original Leatherface. Dan Yeager does exceptionally well and is a lively horror character (obviously suits the role). (9/10) The film is very awarding and the storyline is interesting. It is an enjoyable film unless you're a 'noob' and expect it to be a KICK-ASS blockbuster. The film is easy to follow if you've watched the film movie(1974), as you know the whole 'TCM' storyline.The bad points: Acting- The whole stereotypical performance of a horror film is portrayed where 'Girl runs off but falls to await her death by the serial killer'. Trey Songz, in my eyes is not an actor and there is a reason he is an artist. But his credit to the film isn't satisfactory as he just drives a VW van, play pool, cheat on his girlfriend and die.If your cousin was Leatherface you wouldn't throw him his chainsaw and say ""Do your think cuz"" and that line in the film is a very poor line. No criticism towards Alexandra Daddario as her role deserves credit as her skills are awarding. I think the line wasn't thought through well enough. Summary: This movie is excellent and 'watch-able' more than once. The scenes are detailed and are extreme with the use of blood which is good as they hold no barrier seen as the movie is about one of the most psychopathic serial killers. Actors from the 1974 version (Gunnar Hansen)appear and I think it was clever to bring them back as it suddenly makes the movie better. Relations back to the first movie gives it a boost as despite being a sequel they don't forget previous happenings and retain some of that '74 momentum. Worth a watch. Rating 7/10 improvement(s): The quality of acting.",Texas Chainsaw
302,austinstuntsmcmahons,"Good movie, can't wait for sequel(s)",8,22 July 2013,"Saw this movie three times and never get tired of it. As a die hard chainsaw fan for 6 year4s, having seen 4/7 of the current releases, I think that this film is great. A lot of people don't like it, but I think the twist is innovative, controversial, and unexpected. I didn't see it in 3D but as there were only a few moments that really exposed this 3D part, I think 3D is rather pointless here. The twist is shocking and unprecedented, which is good because, as much as I love the Chainsaw franchise, I think it's time for something new. An old kickback when they drive the old VW Van was fairly annoying as it's been seen in virtually every chainsaw film. It gets old but there is an iconic bit of nostalgia behind the van that should be kept. Anyways forget the van, the movie itself was great. It had sufficient gore, good violence and some expected suspense. There are your usual bone head stupid characters, but if everyone outsmarted Leatherface, we wouldn't have a movie would we? Over all a good film, recommended and blew up the box office at 34,000,000.",Texas Chainsaw
303,Huertadevon,Ummm,2,4 May 2013,"Here's my list of what was wrong with this movie:1. Heather is supposed to be almost 40?2. So much CGI blood and gore....it looked like really crappy video game cut-scenes...especially when the guy gets sucked into the shredder thing. I think Dead Space had more convincing gore.3. What happened to the son/police officer after his dad was killed at the end?? I presume he's still standing by his car...wouldn't he wonder where his dad was when he didn't come out? Did Leatherface and Heather tell him on the way out? ""BTW dickhole, your dad is dead.""4. The guy who robs them was a such a wasted character.5. One black guy, one kind of quirky white guy, one hot white guy and 2 hot girls...standard cliché'd horror movie fare. Yawn. 6. Leatherface only noticed the burn/Sawyer symbol at the end? He carried her all the way downstairs.",Texas Chainsaw
304,Visualdarter,Standard modern day slasher,6,28 May 2013,"This film could have been so much more but wasn't.Positives The effects are fairly good, the acting is better than some modern day slashers but don't get me wrong no awards are going to be won. Possibly the best part is the opening sequences showing clips from the original 1974 version.Negatives The film is set in 2012 yet the baby who grew up to be a pretty attractive young woman has only reached the age of about 22. Every kill in the film is predictable and is only short of the line ""I'll be right back"". And as for the scene with the police man streaming live hd footage on his phone, which not only has no point but just makes the film a bit second rate with clearly no thought being put into the film regarding the time things take place. Either it should have been about 1994 in which case the technology would not exist or it is 2012 and the actress should be a lot older. The twist at the end is also very predictable.",Texas Chainsaw

I'm not one to jump to conclusions, but god it was bad. I've never seen any other Texas Chainsaw Movies, but I really doubt they portrayed leather-face the way they did in this movie. It's like as if they tried to make him some sort of reasonable, gentle-giant character. I hated that.There were more horror movie clichés than friggen cabin in the woods! (haha). One cliché in particular I hate, is when they make an invincible but weak female protagonist. What I mean by that is the girl is just some dumb bimbo, yet she predictably never dies ever throughout the movie! What was the deal with all the shameless boob and butt shots as well? What a lame way to try and attract the audience. Quite literally they made the female lead's boobs jiggle whenever she moved! I counted the times people die from the chainsaw: one. It barely was a death! It was literally a guy who was already dying being sawed in half. LAMEOh god and don't even get me started on the 3D effects. What a gimmicky way to make money!

307,mortonzhou,Probably the worst movie I've ever seen,1,21 May 2013,"I love horror flicks. I thought the 2003 remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a pretty decent horror film. Not amazing, but entertaining nonetheless. This version of Texas Chainsaw caught my attention in the beginning. Giving a flashback sequence to the original Sawyer family members being killed. Things just went downhill after that. Every character in this movie seems to lack a brain and/or is a complete a**hole. On top of that... there was no nudity. I mean c'mon.. what's a horror film without some nudity?! Just to name a few of many things that made this movie bad:Farnsworth a.k.a. the KFC Colonel didn't think it'd be important to tell Heather, there was a 6""5' lunatic living in a hidden basement of her inherited house. Even after all of Heather's friends are brutally murdered by Leatherface, whom she discovers to be her cousin, she feels sorry for him and loves him because he's ""family."" Screw that noise... ALL of her friends are dead because of him. It's not even like he's a close relative. She doesn't even know him. One minute she's scared sh**less of him and the next she loves him AND helps him kill a couple more people?? Are we supposed to believe that her thought process was: ""Oh, hey Cuz, you just knocked me out in the kitchen, almost cut me up with a chainsaw in a coffin, tried killing me by flipping our van, chased me through a carnival with a chainsaw forcing me to hang on to a Ferris Wheel for my life AND killed all of my friends. But that's all okay.. I forgive you because we're family. Now I'm going to help you kill people and take care of you for the rest of my life."" All I could say was... Seriously... wtf just happened.Towards the end, the sheriff was the only character I liked up because he seemed to have a brain... Surprise!!! He's an idiot too! He decides not to shoot Leatherface even after he killed five people in just one night because he feels bad for him. His family died because they were a bunch of murders.... boo hoo. Are we supposed to feel bad for Leatherface??? I sure don't. Yet the makers seemed to think ""let's try to get the audience to feel bad for him."" Last time I checked, Leatherface was a scary serial killer. You're not supposed to feel bad for them. We, as the audience of a slasher film, have no interest in feeling bad for him. We want to be afraid of him. It is a HORROR film after all.In summary. The plot and character development make absolutely zero sense... to the point where it makes you cringe. No thought was put into this movie. Seems like the makers knew Texas Chainsaw fans would go watch this movie so they didn't care to put effort into making it a good one. Don't waste your time and definitely not your money watching this movie. If you want to watch a Texas Chainsaw movie that isn't incredibly old. Go watch the 2003 version. Not a great movie... But it's still (approximately) a million times better than this garbage.",Texas Chainsaw

310,franciscomiranda2729,The best Texas chainsaw massacre movie ever,8,5 July 2013,"The Evolution of Slasher Films There are many Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies: The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Original), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (Remake), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning (Prequel) but none of them are as good as Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D. This film is a direct sequel to the original, which was released in 1974. I like the fact this movies follows the events of the original film and completely ignores the events on the other films. The film takes place in 2012, at the beginning of the movie Heather Miller (Sawyer) is shown as a baby in 1973. At the opening scene, they did a great job on replicating the setting and events from the original 1974 film. The problem arises when locals find baby Heather, then they fast forward to present time (almost 4 decades). The Sawyer baby despite been born in 1973, she is portrayed by the young Alexandra Daddario (26) logically she suppose to be between 35 and 40 years old. Everything indicates that it took place in 2012; smart phones, gas prices, and her grandmother's grave. Another small problem that I think is worth to mention is that in blood scenes, they don't do a very good job because you can actually tell that the blood is fake, which I don't mind at all, but if the type person that likes to see real blood in movies, it could disappoint you. Heather Miller discovers that she was adopted after receiving a letter from her long lost grandmother. She takes a road trip with friends to collect the inheritance her grandmother left her. Heather Miller is young sexy girl, after she read the letter she feels betrayed by her parents, because they lie to her about her origin. She feels anxious, to find out where she comes from and decides to go Texas only to find out that she's a Sawyer and her grandmother left her a mansion among other things. Leatherface is portrayed Dan Yeager, he wears a mask of made of human skin, along with his famous chainsaw. He lives in the basement and that's where he stores his collection of chainsaws and human bodies. He seeks revenge for Sawyer family and kills all of Heather friends, as a consequence of some events that happen during the movie. During the first scenes, there are some funny scenes until they arrive to Texas. The rest of the movie the background music is really creepy, it's a heavy metal type of sound, which I think it helps a lot because the movie has a lot of suspense and intensity. There are things that differentiate this film from the previous is that it has a story line and not just Leatherface murdering every character in the movie also during on of the final scenes, when two police officers start beating Leatherface, you just feel so much compassion and sympathy for the character and for the first time you get an idea of why Leatherface does what he does. I was very impressed with the surprising twisted ending caught me off guard; I could never imagine how they could actually change the situation. Overall this movies is great sequel the original, it shows Heather is a very strong character that goes through different problems, and the shows something about Leatherface that we haven't experiences in different movies. The best thing of this film is that even though is a sequel you don't have to watch previous movies to understand it. I think that the future sequels are going to base on this film, because it has a great story line.",Texas Chainsaw
311,EmmaxK,Disappointing,2,6 August 2013,"As someone who watches a lot of horror films, I honestly had some expectations for this film. but the characters are so dumb. Example: Heather who knows Darryl for like 3 hours when she and her friends pick him up at a gas station, leaves him alone at her house, whilst the house is filled with fancy stuff worth hundreds or maybe thousands of dollars? Think about that. This movie is so disappointing, don't waste money on it. I give this a 2 because there were a few moments when I was a little scared, or something scared me, but it also was super predictable. Watch other movies but don't waste 90 minutes of your life watching this one",Texas Chainsaw
312,maggie-hale232,"I'm sorry, I think I was rooting for the wrong team.",3,29 July 2013,"I was really excited about this movie. the 2003 & 2006 movies scared the absolute crap out of me. and the original is possibly one of the best slashers of all time. that being said, I went into this with high hopes, and maybe that was my problem. here's the thing, I really liked the basis of the movie. the twist was something new and interesting that I liked, despite what other reviewers say. and Alexandra Daddario does a pretty good job as the lead actress. HOWEVER, her friends are so freaking annoying, that I'm actually happy to see them killed off. ESPECIALLY her promiscuous ""bestfriend"" who's sleeping with her boyfriend. and while the acting by Trey Songz was better than expected, I still didn't like him because of his obvious character flaws. besides that, maybe I missed something, but if her adopted parents and their friends killed the whole family, how did she have a surviving grandmother to leave her a house? and how did they know where she was if she went missing as a child. another thing, why is Leatherface trying to kill her if he's supposed to be protecting her. there are so many plot twists the movie doesn't even make sense. and there isn't enough blood to make the movie good. as I said earlier, with the 2006 movie especially, I was just sitting there cringing the entire time. but with this version, I'm just rolling my eyes. i'm glad I only spent $1.20 on this.",Texas Chainsaw
313,Pussy-Monster,This movie doesn't even try.,1,16 July 2013,"-The direction sucks. It has no atmosphere what so ever and when Leatherface gets a new mask it looks all old.-The writing is awful. Its fails at basic math and logic. The writers(yes, plural) think that the number of years between 1974 and 2012 is 20-something.-A subplots that go nowhere. The main character's boyfriend cheats on her with her best friend and she never founds out.-The characters are one dimensional, stupid, and make extremely surreal decisions. When the main character runs from Leatherface she gets on a fairest wheel.The dialogue is dumb and laughable.One character says ""welcome to Texas, motherf****er!"" even though he has lived in Texas for years and ""Do your thing cuz!"" HAHAHA!Even with a 39+ million budget the production value is crap. It uses CGI gore and fire. And Leatherface's mask and Trey Song's decapitated head looks so much like plastic. -The acting is bad. -It tries to make serial killing cannibals look like innocent people.The only thing that was good was Alexandra Daddario well toned abs and sideboobs. One of the worst movies ever I have ever seen.",Texas Chainsaw
314,aaron-patton-772-486947,why so glum chums?,7,22 August 2013,"Reading about what my fellow reviewers had to say was surprising. Can't understand some of the harsh attacks on what was, quite honestly a very well crafted film. We have to remember what high standards this film was following up to, the 1974 version which is probably up there with some of the best horror films ever made from a personal perspective.The film almost drags along at the same pace throughout, but with interesting twists along the way. *SPOILER* The end scenes are very clever. Here you have a mentally dysfunctional psychopathic monster, joined by his newly discovered cousin who helps see off the mayor, leaving those two to carry on the Sawyer legacy. Hopefully until the next Chainsaw film comes around.To sum up, £3.50 wasn't much of a price to pay to watch this film, after it truly lived up to my expectations. Some dodgy acting here and there, some not so well written scenes but at the end of the day, probably what you could call a 'cliff hanger'. Surely paving the way for yet another unpredictable Leatherface return and will be highly anticipated.",Texas Chainsaw
315,BatteriesNotIncluded,Bad writing almost sank this fun sequel,5,6 January 2013,"This part is important, which is why I am saying it first: I thought it was a fun movie. It wasn't a great movie... and it wasn't bad either. It was just fun, at least for the most part.The combined weight of the standard clichés were adequately compensated this time around by the more interesting story concept that we eventually get to - despite the audience knowing about it from the get-go. Too bad, then, that it was so underused. It felt like the film put it's running shoes on during the opening and then fell into a ditch 10 minutes later. The army of writers make the audience wade through a bog of clichéd horror bulls**t whilst we let the characters (or Heather at least) catch on so we can get down the to COOL stuff - by which time we have about 15-20 minutes left of the movie. If you are going to make the audience suffer the cliché and have the slow-build to Heather's realisation then you HAVE TO make her later transformation believable. And it wasn't. Shame. Many will deem the movie stupid because of it and I cannot blame them. Daddario worked with what she had and she did a good job, actually. In fact, so did Yeager. As one of the better ideas behind the movie, Leatherface isn't the villain. Not ultimately, anyway. This was refreshing and very welcomed. Yeager shouldered the role well.Anyway, back to the story. I get that they *could* have been aiming for it to be tragic, in that all of her friend's got unnecessarily butchered because she didn't read the bloody letter(!) but that would only work if we gave two shits about the characters. Her best friend is a slut who eventually twists the arm of Heather's boyfriend into a cheap lay. So there's two characters you can kill straight away. One is a thieving toolbag hitchhiker; bye-bye. Finally we've got the friend who cooks and stumbles across the wrong door. Still no empathy, just a shame he had to go first from the original group. They make for good cannon fodder and Leatherface's chainsaw though.They had such a cool concept on their hands and they just handled it poorly. It causes the film to misfire as a result. The film is littered with holes and lazy writing. What happened to Scott Eastwood's character? The tie-in to the original isn't as smooth as it at least should have been, I don't get why the time-line had to be fudged from 1974? To incorporate iPhones? For that one scene? Can't be? Maybe it was a budgetary decision - period vehicles etc? Who knows. Some of the dialogue is just awful. One line in particular I remember squirming at when reading the script. I was mortified when it was uttered in the final cut of the actual movie. MORTIFIED. Luessenhop fortunately had the foresight to cut ""Leatherface deflecting bullets with his chainsaw moment"" and ""Leatherface hopping onto a train Steven Seagal style"" scenes though.But, back to my first comment. It was a fun movie. I was never bored and it was great to even have a character transformation and empathy ""retooling"" as the movie did, despite how it was handled. I don't think audiences will expect that if they don't know anything about the movie. Indeed, there were a few cool scenes, especially the one's involving Leatherface and Heather (by that I mean the quieter scenes...) This is genuinely one of the better Chainsaw films that I will certainly be re-watching. I just wish the writer's (or whomever came up with the concept) handed it off to someone with a bit more skill on the keyboard.",Texas Chainsaw
316,metalnic1970,The Original Grandpa Returns... For A Split Second? WTF?!,2,25 November 2013,"The only reason I rented this was that I heard John Dugan - the actor that played the role of grandpa in the original 1974 TCM - was returning to the role in this 2013 version. I discovered this when I met him in October at a meet and greet he was doing at a haunted house in Louisville, KY. My wife and I watched the DVD and when it was over, aside from being completely disappointed by the movie itself, we were asking ourselves where was grandpa? After going through frame by frame we discovered he was in the scene with the family toward the beginning, but one literally has to go slow motion/pause to actually see him. Maybe it's because his makeup job was so sub par to the original, but I think it's more a commentary on why classics need to stop being made for the millennial generation. It follows the same formula as every other sequel, prequel, re-imagining, etc; put out today: weak story; CGI and 3D effects trying to compensate for a lack of creativity and substance; the stereotypical, vegan-fed, cosmetically enhanced actresses; the obligatory African-American male in a primary role among the youths, there for nothing more than filling a 21st century quota; and the criminal misuse of legends from the classics such as in the way John Dugan was. I only wish grandpa could take his sledge to the writers, director, crew, and much of the cast throughout yet another disappointing installment of an American classic.",Texas Chainsaw
317,jmc176,Sorry I'm late but I'm here to set the record straight.,6,3 May 2017,"**spoilers**First off i waited four years to watch this movie because of all the terrible things i heard about it, and i must say nope mostly of what i heard is BS. Of the several dozen reviews i read on here i may have read one and that's including the good reviews. If i read one more bad review because there were no tits in the movie i may chainsaw myself.Now to begin. Yes the worst part of the movie is the gross disregard to continuity they're about as delicate as throwing a newspaper of a spill, even though the movie is supposed to take place about 17-20 years after the original. Literally all they do is keep the actual present date from the movie goer. There's actually a part with a newspaper and they purposely keep the date just off screen. Also the 3D does not translate well to home video, It probably costed them a ton of money for less than 5 minutes of 3D. Now having said that...The movie is just what a Texas Chainsaw should be, yes there are some ugly spots along the way, but there are very few masterpiece horror movies to speak of. It starts off well spite the family going from four to four dozen for no reason. Great cameos from Gunner Hanson and Bill Moseley. Fast forward to ""present day"" I'm just going to assume everyone looks great for their age being 39 years later. A big flaw in horror movies is that the lead in the film tend to be annoying or stale, Daddario is neither, shes a totally solid female lead. There are some throw away characters but what body count movie doesn't have them to pad the count, for example i still don't know Tre Songz's characters name, I just called him Tre Songs though his run through the movie. Now on to the plot. Chick inherits a house she shows up chainsaw blood death blah blah..If you're reading my review you've probably seen the movie, I'm not going to nitpick the heck out of a body count film. On the point of the whole movie that everyone has missed the biggest consistency though the entire franchise other than chainsaws and Leatherface is family say it with me family. That's why she sides with Leatherface even after he kills all her friends including the boyfriend. To the Sawyer's there's nothing greater than family and guess what, she's a Sawyer. The same bonds burn deep in her soul as well. which again is the same reason she freaks out when she learns the truth about what happened spite how horrible they were.In closing there's blood, chainsaws, death and family what else do you need for a Texas Chainsaw film. I gave it a 6 of 10 (i gave the original 7 of 10) I hope this review sheds new light on some over dramatic opinions. If i changed one persons mind i can die a happy man. Thank you.",Texas Chainsaw
318,Masseffectman,"A great Chainsaw adventure, nice scenery & stunning main actress",9,28 July 2015,"This film is actually pretty good, and definitely the best of the trio of modern Texas Chainsaw movies. I won't get into the details of the plot, as many people have outlined it in detail already, but suffice it to say, the characters, scenic location and relatively different storyline make for an enjoyable experience.The film impressed me with the extra effort put into the story that took a while to build up. The cinematography is excellent, and you really get a feel that the film-makers enjoyed the environment they were shooting in. Alexandra Daddario in the lead role is a complete charmer, she proves to be a cool calm and collected young woman who cuts a stunningly beautiful figure in her crop top and low-rise jeans.The transfer to Blu-ray is impeccable, with only fine banding during transitions. Slight grain has been added, to give it a more filmic look, as it was (commonly) shot digitally. Audio is excellent, with a lossless 7.1 track providing punch during the many jump scares.Overall i overwhelmingly recommend this film, especially if you thought the movie from 2003 with Jessica Biel was good, this one is much better.",Texas Chainsaw
319,justtmbreviews,A good remake? Yes. A Good Film? Not really.,6,2 October 2015,"In the midst of the remake frenzy of the last decade, many have failed in popular opinion to hold up as a faithful, or to work as a film. But arguably none have tried and failed as much as the Texas Chainsaw Series. Boasting a record of 3 total different 'Remakes' yeah I know Beginning was an origin story, and 3D is supposedly a direct sequel to the original. But both of them try to remake the story in either predated setting, or a modern setting. So yeah remake. Back to the point, this series has had issues getting itself going in the modern century. That being said I like most remakes namely all of the big names (ANOES, FT13, Hallowen, and Texas Chainsaw) I always give them a fair chance, and their time in the sun. So is Texas Chainsaw 3D a good remake/sequel? Yes. A good film? Not really... Now I feel this film would've been held as one of the better remakes if the creators weren't hell bent on two things, The 3D, and Making this a modern version. I'll elaborate on those problems later. First let me clear up some easy good things. The Acting is decent Alexandra Daddario is pretty good, and very good to look at. Dan Yeagers leatherface is great. He is extremely threatening and imposing. Pretty freaky stuff. Everyone else is fine, they do their jobs, but not much more. The film is shot BEAUTIFULLY. All the colors pop, there's some awesome, and just down right creepy imagery. Another positive is this film moves quickly, making it a fun popcorn watch. It succeeds very well in that right. The effects are great, well most of them. Most of the effects and gore are great. And almost all practical. There was a lot of passion put into this film. (Shown in the special features) but those two things I mentioned earlier weigh extremely heavily on this films overall quality, and credibility. The 3D is good, in the aspect that it's barely in the movie. They spent so much time and effort in incorporating the 3D but it's barely there. Time would've been better spent into establishing or better yet figuring out a better way to use the setting. You see they desperately wanted a modern remake so badly they willingly over looked all the continuity errors (our main character should be in her mid 30s for one) They were literally aware of these errors and ignored them anyway. A better way to avoid all of this is to scrap the sequel idea all together, I mean it doesn't really play any major part in the story, or they could set it in the 90s. This movie isn't that modern anyway, hell the only thing modern about is a cop uses a smart phone once. ONCE. You ruined your movie for some dumb Skype scene. You ruined the credibility of your franchise to use Skype. They scene in which the smart phone is used would've been better on a 90s mobile call anyway. It would've built suspense much better.They missed a really promising shot at a remake. This had many good things, but it had two flaws that you can't see past. Texas Chainsaw gets a 6/10 All That being said I hope the scheduled Leatherface prequel is in this universe, with Dan Yeager. I also hope it's good.",Texas Chainsaw
320,Johnnys_Drivein,Leatherface rides a roller-coaster of emotions,4,10 January 2013,"I was let down in the first few minutes,then when i realized the direction it was headed in it made for an interesting story. But when I recognized the same old pattern of a group of...twenty-somethings--(Thirty somethings? If it was trying to keep track with the original time line then the ages of the young adults were kind of off.) I became bored again. It was the same thing we saw in the last two remakes that claimed to do the original film justice. However,the plot goes up and down another hill and completely changes into something different towards the climax once again. Either way,it's a strange script and it will make you scratch your head a few times.Alexandra Daddario is a fine actress,and took the lead role down with no problems in my opinion.

Nothing made sense in this story. The film suddenly tries to portray a sick psychopath serial into some kind of an anti-hero is just plain stupid with that kinda background story. I guess I should pretend to be a 3yr old watching this. There's nothing to feel compassionate for the killer. What's the deal with a seemingly normal girl by parents (doesn't seemingly abusive towards her) and whose friends got mercilessly slaughtered suddenly feels compassionate for the killer simply because they are somewhat related? And a supposedly righteous cop who actually allow this to happen and let the killer go? This story must be based on an alternative universe where nothing made sense.Absolute rubbish.The plot is so shallow, it is like its written by a 5 years old.
