0,SnoopyStyle,great comedians but not clicking in this,5,11 August 2015,"James King (Will Ferrell) is a highly successful trader and just made partner by Martin Barrow (Craig T. Nelson). He is set to marry the bosses' high maintenance daughter Alissa (Alison Brie). Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) is a hard working car wash owner trying to get ahead. At his engagement party, James is arrested for fraud. The evidence is fake but he's sentenced to ten years in maximum security anyways. He thinks Darnell is an ex-con and pays him $30k to teach the ways of prison.Individually, these are great comedians. I rather have them play buddies but this still works a little. It's a lot of prison rape jokes and being gangster. It's more stupid than funny. Nevertheless, it still has a few funny moments.",Get Hard
1,Horst_In_Translation,Pretty bland,4,5 May 2016,"""Get Hard"" is a very simple title for this 100-minute movie from last year and it is also a very simple film I dare say. Don't be fooled by the director's name, he has nothing to do with the Coen Bros. And what I find the most shocking here is the number of writers who worked on this project. How can so many people not realize that the script is pretty bad and try to improve it. Oh well.. I guess they did and just couldn't do anything about it as they don't have the talent. You cannot really blame lead actors Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart as it is basically impossible to turn this screenplay into a quality movie, no matter how good their performances would be. Not that they were particularly good though.I believe this film is just another from in the endless amount of films that exist out there and were really only made to get some cash and not with any creative ambition at all. I am almost a bit embarrassed to say that I somewhat liked the idea of a rich white man who has to go to jail and a black man trying to get him ready for it, even if it is all very absurd of course. There was some comedic potential in here and I believe a skilled writer could have turned this into a decent watch. But he would need to be way better than the people who worked on this one here. I just hope they won't make a sequel anytime soon, no idea if this was successful enough commercially, but if so, they will for sure. That's how it works sadly. I don't care about it though. ""Get Hard"" was a really weak film. Stay away.",Get Hard
2,nogodnomasters,A GAME YOU CAN WIN,8,24 July 2018,"James King (Will Ferrell) is a rich broker on his way to jail. Darnell (Kevin Hart) washes his car. King has got 30 days to get his affairs in order and hires Darnell (Kevin Hart) to teach him to ""get hard"" so he won't be bullied (or worse) in prison. Most of the film consists of Hart teaching Ferrell a bunch of dumb stuff doing racial and gay humor. Eventually they get around to gee, maybe he is innocent, let's figure this out.Most of the humor was juvenile. Some scenes they carried out too long. The disgusting scenes tended to be short. I admit that I had to laugh out loud several times during a film that the audience certainly enjoyed more than I did. At times I felt I was watching ""48 Hours"" meets ""Trading Places."" I am not a fan of either star in this film. They can't act and individually I don't find them funny. They seemed to do well acting as a straight man for each other so neither one hogged the scene. Soft 4 stars.Guide: F-bomb, sex. Brief nudity including Ferrell's butt or body double.",Get Hard
3,kosmasp,Prison Coach,6,4 October 2015,"Which is the title the movie got in Germany (for a change it's not an English title, but in German). Considering the comedy talent at hand, I understand that some might be disappointed in this. But it's still decent enough, even with some mediocre jokes thrown in there from time to time. Not to mention the fact, that this is as predictable as it gets (story wise that is).Not sure if the jokes about homosexuality work most of the time either, but you have to give/cut them some slack for trying (while not dumbing them down too much). The word play is there (see title), which is played out pretty nicely in one particular scene (turning point sort of). Don't expect too much and you'll be entertained",Get Hard
4,paul_haakonsen,Mayo and Chocolat...,6,23 May 2017,"I had my fear that this might turn out to be just another Will Ferrell comedy, but luckily it turned out to be anything but that. ""Get Hard"" was a very funny and entertaining movie, and I must admit that I am glad that I did take the time to sit down and watch it.""Get Hard"" is about James (played by Will Ferrell) whom is framed for fraud and sentenced to go to 10 years in prison. He has 30 days to conclude his affairs before having to go to prison. He decides to get help from Darnell (played by Kevin Hart) in order to be ready for prison.The story in ""Get Hard"" was filled with funny moments and hilarious scenes, and it was so nicely brought to life on the screen by Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart.The chemistry between Ferrell and Hart is really unique and that is reflected on the screen. They act quite well opposite one another, and each compliments the other nicely on the screen. It was also nice to have Craig T. Nelson in the movie, despite of having a minor role only.I was laughing a lot throughout the course of this movie, and the comedy in ""Get Hard"" is really great.This is indeed a good comedy movie, and it is definitely well worth watching if you are looking for a proper comedy movie.",Get Hard
5,edwagreen,**1/2,5,8 December 2015,"I guarantee that within 10 minutes of the film, you shall know who is framing the Will Ferrell character and is the guilty party.Ferrell is hilarious in the sense that he is leading a fabulous life and just about ready to marry the boss's daughter, and the former is a multi-millionaire. All this comes down suddenly when the Ferrell character is suddenly arrested and charged with embezzlement and fraud.Quickly convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail, Ferrell is give 30 days to wind up his affairs and uses that time to take lessons from a black car wash attendant on how to become tough. He dresses in outlandish clothes, talks the black lingo, and acts all the way as the stereotyped black gangster is supposed to act.After a while, this all becomes very tedious and ultimately quite routine.",Get Hard
6,Theo Robertson,It's Hard To Be Funny But Easy To Be Silly,5,1 April 2015,"I'm not a great fan of film comedy . The reason I watched GET HARD as because it has a premise that I couldn't resist . Millionaire James King gets caught for fraud and finds himself bound for a maximum security prison for ten years and finds himself asking for much needed advice as to how he's going to survive the ordeal . We all know what goes on in these maximum security prisons in the good old USA and despite not agreeing with the death penalty if someone has the choice between death and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole getting slowly incinerated by 10,000 volts almost seems like an act of mercy . On top of that I once had an idea of a screenplay where two uncaring bleeding heart lawyers from Britain go on holiday to America and a mix up at the airport sees them being charged with drug possession and find themselves facing a long sentence in the jungle of American hard time and come to realise why it's better that violent criminals are behind bars rather than walking the streets so this looked like a comedy I would enjoy even if it was only in a low brow way I'm afraid that GET HARD struggles to amuse even in a low brow way . I laughed out loud at the NAKED GUN films mainly because not matter how ludicrous and slapstick the situations were the cast in general and Leslie Neilson in particular kept a straight face . GET HARD often fails to do this and Will Ferrell in particular constantly mugs for the camera when it would have been much more effective playing things a little more serious . Even worse Kevin Hart gives the impression his role and performance would have been relatively good if he'd kept up the pretense of being some tough , streetwise homie from the ghetto . Indeed this seems to be an underlying problem where everything in overdone in the silliness stakes and the film is conscious of the fact the film revolves around a premise of a rich white guy needing advice from a working class black guy and race being an understandably sensitive subject in America the film feels the need to point out "" Guys I know we're playing up to racial stereotypes but it's a comedy film and look how we're not taking any of this seriously "" . Despite using some foul language and of course homophobia and gags involving prison rape which I'm ashamed to say I did find vaguely amusing on a low level GET HARD isn't as funny as it could have been",Get Hard

8,oscaralbert,"Rampant Straight slurs, wall-to-wall Heterophobia, and gratuitous Majority bashing . . .",6,29 March 2015,". . . on the part of GET HARD already has aroused the sleeping giant watchdog of the Straight And Light Allied Deacons (SALAD) activists in my neighborhood. It seems that GET HARD cannot make any pretense of boning up for humor without insulting the core institutions of the American Majority. From European condiments such as Mayonnaise to Straight Traditions as basic as the Simple Handshake, GET HARD insinuates that the total OR PARTIAL genetic make-up of 300 million plus Americans (who all share some White and\or Straight DNA) is fair game for ridicule and mocking. If this barrage of Hate Speech was fired at Gay or Black people, everyone involved would be pink-slipped at the initial salvo. But as SALAD takes to the streets with its daily ""Clocks up, don't flirt!"" rallies protesting this GET HARD travesty, maybe a faint ray of hope that the worm has finally turned constitutes a silver lining to its dark cloud of misanthropy.

9,neil-476,Better than expected,7,3 April 2015,"Successful investment broker James (Will Ferrell) is given 10 years in San Quentin for fraud, with 30 days to get his affairs in order beforehand. Knowing that he will be unable to survive the experience, he hires his black jailbird car cleaner Darnell (Kevin Hart) to toughen him up beforehand. What he doesn't know is that Darnell has never been near a prison.Will Ferrell is a tall white man and Kevin Hart is a short black man, and the height differential between the tall soft white man and the short aggressive black man is quite a good sight gag. Leaving that to one side for the moment, I admire Will Ferrell's talent but don't like very much of what he does, and I'm not overly familiar with Kevin Hart apart from the fact that I get the impression that he appears to come from the Martin Lawrence school of aggressive, shouty ""comedy"", so I wasn't expecting great things. And my expectations were born out in the early stages of this film. Predicated upon a contradictory scenario of an extremely stupid man who has made a lot of money by being extremely smart, with humour which otherwise consists mainly of shouting prodigious quantities of profanity and numerous ""jokes"" about homosexual anal rape, the young audience in the cinema laughed and I didn't.The middle section - the toughening up boot camp section - was still shouty, sweary, and full of anal rape jokes, but contained some decent moments where the two characters start to bond somewhat. And the final section, where they finally seek to find the evidence necessary to clear James and put the real villain behind bars was actually quite good.Accordingly, this was better than I expected it to be. But its real audience is people who like sweary anal rape jokes.",Get Hard
10,anaconda-40658,"Boy, the Title is Suggestive.",6,22 May 2015,"Get Hard (2015): Dir: Etan Cohen / Cast: Will Ferrell, Kevin Hart, Craig T. Nelson, Alison Brie, T.I.: Raunchy comedy about getting real with oneself. Will Ferrell plays wealthy James King who is arrested for fraud during his engagement party. Despite pleading innocent he is convicted and given thirty days to get his affairs in order before going to prison. Being absolutely racist, he seeks help from Darnell Lewis, played by Kevin Hart, a family man who operates a car wash. He is approached by King on the bases that he is African American, believing him to have been in prison, based on stereotypes. Needing $30, 000 to move his family into a nicer home, Darnell agrees to train him for prison life despite never being there himself. Starts out well until descending into formula and an outcome that is easily detected within the first fifteen minutes. What works is the effective chemistry between the two comedic leads. Ferrell's mansion is transformed into a practical prison but he fails the parade of abuses cooked up by Hart until he is reduced from a ""mad dog face"" to a ""sad dog face."" Hart struggles to maintain an image formed through pop culture that has his wife denying his ability to pull this scheme off. Supporting roles are a total waste. T.I plays a relative of Hart's on the wrong side of the law. Craig T. Nelson as Ferrell's boss and potential father-in-law is way too obvious too early, and Alison Brie as his daughter and Ferrell's fiancée is a cash grabbing tramp with material aim. While the stereotypes are grossly offensive, they do point out one's faults when sighting one's appearance over their inner being. Score: 6 / 10",Get Hard
11,FlashCallahan,Get Hard?........Get Lost.,3,16 April 2015,"When millionaire hedge fund manager James is found guilty of fraud and bound for a stretch in San Quentin, the judge gives him 30 days to get his affairs in order. Desperate, he turns to Darnell to prep him for a life behind bars. But despite James' one- percentage assumptions, Darnell is a hard-working small business owner who has never received a parking ticket, let alone been to prison. Together, the two men do whatever it takes for James to be prepared and, in the process, discover how wrong they were about a lot of things........including each other. Kevin Hart is quickly becoming this generations Pauly Shore, good on TV, but his films are getting poorer and poorer, and it's becoming clear now that he hasn't the star power that the studios would like you to think.But it's not his fault, he has screen presence, it's just that the material he is given is lost in the Stone Age, as this is the type of movie where racism, sexual assault and sexual orientation panic are the height of comedy, and this became tiresome in the nineties.The plot is basically a blatant rip of the Rob Schneider movie 'Big Stan' and Ferrell is doing the same schtick here he's been doing for years when he isn't Ron Burgundy, and that too is becoming tiresome.So we endure nearly two hours of Hart stereotyping every culture, because this prepares you for prison. And we have Ferrell dress as a gang member and mock his ethnicity, because this will give the film balance, and prepare you for prison.To call it offensive is an understatement, when the supposed comedy highlight of the film is Ferrell on his knees in a toilet, makes you disgusted rather than laughing heartily, the film is losing.But there is the odd funny moment, any time when Ferrell and Hart are in a wide shot, its hilarious to see how taller Ferrell is, the height of vertically challenged comedy.This generations Eddie Murphy? Now that sentence is funnier than the whole film.Get Hard? get lost more like........",Get Hard
12,phd_travel,LOL funny - covers all the current stereotypes,8,26 March 2015,"This comedy covers lots of current criminals and racial and class stereotypes. It's quite laugh out loud funny throughout and more clever than crude. Watch out for lots of unexpected one liners. Of course there are some crude moments - what comedy doesn't have them but I think it is more relevant and funny than the Seth Rogan type comedies. After a rising fund manager millionaire gets arrested and convicted of fraud, he hires a black man to get him ready for prison. Will Ferrell is good and makes some painful moments bearable. Kevin Hart is good too not over doing it - his ""prison yard"" scene is well done. Alison Brie of Mad Men is surprisingly alluring as Will's girlfriend. John Mayer makes a small cameo. You have the white white collar criminal - fund manager of course, black ex prison gang members, neo Nazi white supremacists, gays. It's funny in each different situation especially teaching the gang members about finance.One of the funnier comedies in recent years.",Get Hard

If you don't like him then you just should not start watching this movie. I do like him even though this one is not his best one. I only laughed a couple of times. Most of the time because of the unbelievable stupid faces he makes but the humour itself this time was pretty low to me. Kevin Hart is mildly funny in this movie. I expected much more so I am a little bit disappointed. But nevertheless it's worth watching once, just for Ferrells stupid faces and jokes. Will I watch it again in the future? Probably not. Do I regret watching it? Not at all.",Get Hard

15,StevePulaski,Another comedy that has a lower impression of you than you have of it,1,5 April 2015,"Etan Cohen's ""Get Hard"" is an absolutely abysmal comedy for more reasons than it takes the worst attributes of both its lead performers and tries to make a ninety-four minute film rely on them. The film makes the classic mistake of assuming that all it takes to be funny is to be mindlessly vulgar and have several sight gags masquerading as comedy, forgoing any semblance of wit and subtly in order to be as brazen as possible. When Will Ferrell's straight-laced character was reading off numerous insults he concocted himself, and one of them was ""I will punch you right in the f***,"" I knew what kind of comedy was on my hands, and I wanted to wash them thoroughly with soap and water.This is a hopelessly dirty and incompetently racist film, but it's far too stupid and narrow-minded to be seen as truly offensive. Admittedly, however, to see a film like this get made in 2015, in a time where political correctness runs rampant, is very surprising, but nonetheless, to be offended by ""Get Hard"" gives the film too much credit. It implies that a strong reaction was prompted during the film where the film doesn't deserve such. It deserves to be dismissed and quietly swept away to late night TV on Comedy Central where its only audience will be insomniacs and very curious cinephiles. With the ample amount of Judd Apatow comedies that have proved they can be raunchy and heartfelt, there's no place for a film like ""Get Hard"" and its breathless attempts to be funny.The film concerns James King (Will Ferrell), a wealthy hedge-fund manager who is engaged to a gold-digging woman and working for his father's company. He has an enormous house and is constantly reminded of how important it is to go after one's goals by his manipulative wife who sees nothing but untold dollar signs in him. During his birthday party, James is indicted on several counts of embezzlement and is given a month leeway before he's sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison (this part makes ""Get Hard"" kind of a fantasy film, but I digress).In order to find out how to survive in prison, James seeks out the first black man he sees, a man named Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart), who works in a car wash at James' office. Despite Darnell never having been to prison, he sees James' racial profiling and stupidity as pitiful traits and agrees to help him for $30,000. Darnell concocts a rigorous prison training course, complete with weight-lifting, prison riots, ""kiestering,"" and gay sex in order to make James ""hard"" (aka ready for prison).As expected, ""Get Hard"" descends into the ""maximum antics, minimum laughter"" realm of comedy fairly quickly. Jokes and sight gags are fired constantly, but all of which burdened by embedded stereotypes, shallow writing, mundane vulgarity, or a combination of the three. During these scenes, Ferrell plays bumbling and clueless and Hart plays frantic and loud, effectively minimizing each of their talents to conform to the bottom-barrel screenplay at hand. The sole merit of the film is how it appears to evoke the tired idea perpetuated by the wealthy that all the poor or the working class need to do is pull themselves up by their bootstraps and they too can be as successful as they are. This scene is demonstrated pretty effectively during the first time James and Darnell interact (Darnell taps on James' window to get his attention and James thinks he's being robbed), but the film quickly forgoes that element of social satire in order to maximize its time for desperately unfunny humor.By now, you know if you want to see ""Get Hard"" or not, and if you do, that's your own prerogative. This is another one of those films so tailor-made for the lowest common denominator where, much like most Happy Madison films, those who made the film have a lower impression of those who will see the film than you ever could of the film. When you see ""Get Hard,"" just know that it and its creators stoop to a level of condescending none of us can begin to understand.",Get Hard
16,KineticSeoul,The trailer is way more amusing than this,4,12 July 2015,"This seemed more like a montage flick with one step after another of teaching some guy how to survive in prison. And the montage parts was the only redeeming part about this movie. And it wasn't even all that funny. It's basically one of those movies where the trailer is more amusing then the actual movie itself. Will Ferrell is once again playing the same character that he always plays, which is basically a man-child. Except he has the smarts for business, but no common sense. Kevin Hart is the same when it comes to the characters he plays, except I found him more to be likable in this and less obnoxious. I was just bored with this movie and had a slight headache when it was finished. Overall this is a dull comedy that is uber cheesy and lacks any real creativity. It might be amusing for some, but it didn't really float my boat.4.5/10",Get Hard
17,Hellmant,Something went horribly wrong here!,5,1 April 2015,"'GET HARD': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Two of the biggest comedic stars in film today, Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, team up for this surprisingly unfunny comedy flick! The story revolves around a millionaire businessman, sentenced to ten years in prison for fraud, who hires his car washer to train him for a tough prison life, due to the fact that he's black. The movie was directed by screenwriter, turned first-time feature filmmaker, Etan Cohen; and it was written by Cohen, Jay Martel, Ian Roberts and Adam McKay (McKay also produced the film, with Ferrell). There's a few good jokes, here and there, but the movie is mostly just a bore.James King (Ferrell) is a successful hedge fund manager; who's about to marry his beautiful, but extremely self-centered, fiancée, Alissa (Alison Brie). His car washer, Darnell Lewis, is desperately trying to come up with $30,000; to put his daughter, Makayla (Ariana Neal), in a better school. When James is sentenced to ten years in prison, for fraud, he asks Darnell to prepare him for a rough prison life; due to the fact that he thinks Darnell has already been to prison, because he's black. Darnell reluctantly agrees to the proposition, in exchange for the $30,000 he needs.The premise is a pretty funny idea for a good comedy flick, and Ferrell and Hart are probably the two best actors for the two leading roles, but something went horribly wrong here! It could just be the inexperience of Cohen, as a director, but I also think the script probably could have used several more rewrites. Most of the jokes just aren't funny (despite the best efforts, given by all of the cast) and the movie is just a pain to sit through. Which is really surprising, given all the talent involved (especially Ferrell, Hart and the four writers). There are still a few good laughs, scattered throughout the film, but everyone involved has done much better work before. I'd almost say the movie is a complete waste of time; I'm sure Ferrell, Hart and Cohen's next films will be much better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/IG_hW4WZgWE",Get Hard
18,Buddy-51,Typically overwrought Hollywood comedy,4,11 January 2016,"The crudely titled ""Get Hard"" is a version of ""Pygmalion"" the likes of which George Bernard Shaw could never possibly have imagined. Here the roles have been reversed, with the learned professor transmogrified into a streetwise working-class regular guy (Kevin Hart), while the lower-class flower girl has become a highly successful hedge fund manager (Will Ferrell). When the latter is unjustly convicted of embezzling funds and sentenced to ten years in prison, the desperate man turns to Hart to instruct him in the fine art of staying alive behind bars.Hart and Ferrell do yeoman work with some pretty shoddy material, which boils down, essentially, to a 100-minute-long prison-rape joke, with homophobic attitudes that are, quite frankly, shocking to behold in the second decade of the 21st Century.There are a few funny moments when Ferrell spends an afternoon with Hart's relatives in the 'hood, but the movie is clearly more concerned with indulging in crude slapstick than in delivering anything even remotely resembling biting social satire.",Get Hard
19,thesar-2,Die Hard Laughing,7,3 July 2015,"You know a comedy is funny when you can recall, share and laugh out loud some of the jokes and bits a day or more later. Same thing happened with Ted 2 and more recently with Get Hard.While the movie was A-B-C and not all jokes worked – say, only 7% of them didn't, the movie was a riot from beginning to end. It was my first Kevin Hart film and I loved him in thisso much, I now need to see Ride Along since I won that DVD 6 months ago and never got around to it. Will also did fairly well, but the real pleasure came from Hart's many attempts to dehumanize himself into stereotypes. This really shined in front of his family.I heard about some controversy surrounding this, namely that the movie was homophobic. A really good friend and professional critic furiously defended the movie as not-one-bit anti-gay. At the time, or months ago, I believed him. He made very good points. After seeing it, I strongly agree. I didn't catch one homophobic subtext in this film. Ferrell's James fears sexual assault and rape while he's facing a 10- year sentence in San Quentin. He's straight and frankly, doesn't want to perform or have performed on him, gay sex. Understandable. But, even putting his natural instincts aside, what he doesn't want most: not getting raped. The same thing for a woman being locked in a room full of mad, sex-crazed lunatics (SEE: A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child.) I'm sure she fears the same thing as James did. It's not homophobic from his POVit's logical. Besides all that, again, this movie was hilarious, especially the (what appeared to be) improv'ed scenes. A must watch for comedy lovers. * * *Final thoughts: Sadly, I hated the ending. Hated it! No spoiler, but if you've seen this, it involves James' gun in the last couple of minutes of film. Totally unnecessary, not funny and sad all rolled together. This didn't bring the rest of the movie down, mercifully, but it did lose a star for this.",Get Hard

21,Robert_duder,It is what you would expect,6,6 April 2015,"I don't know what is happening to me as a movie buff. I seem to be overcoming certain hatreds I have for Hollywood stars. Julianne Moore won me over last year with the amazing Still Alice and Kevin Hart won me over early this year with The Wedding Ringer. I despised Kevin Hart and now I've even watched his stand up and I actually enjoy him somehow. I've also NEVER been a fan of Will Ferrell and yet when I saw the trailer for this I knew I wanted to see it for some reason. Get Hard is funny. Its a raunchy, silly, stupid, adult comedy with exactly what fans of Ferrell and Hart would expect. The two of them together are very good and I hope maybe we have a comedy duo that will show up together again. Get Hard is not brilliant and its not the best comedy I've seen lately but it is decent and fun and you will laugh. The accusations of the film being homophobic and racist is ludicrous. The film is a stupid comedy. It isn't making any social commentary and if you find some within the film then you are easily offended and should probably steer clear of modern day comedies. The film pokes fun at a wide variety of people and yes in some ways that includes gay people and black people along with Latinos, rich wall street types, bankers...its just making fun of everyone.Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell are themselves. It just so happens I recently watched a Kevin Hart stand up and it was almost identical to his entire performance in this film. That is neither good nor bad because if you are a fan of his then you'll enjoy him. There is not a lot of depth to either of their characters because there simply doesn't need to be. They work well together, they are filthy and the film is filled with toilet humour but it was tolerable even for me who hates that kind of low brow humour. Craig T.Nelson has a small role as Ferrell's future father-in-law and a would be villain. I love Nelson, the guy has a terrific presence and always has but he is underused in this film and almost seems bored. Alison Brie is ridiculously over the top as Ferrell's fiancé. Brie was always good on community but this shows she can be as raunchy as the best adult comedians and she does decently. Her and Ferrell are surprisingly good together too. T.I., Erick Chavarria, Ariana Neal, Edwina Findley Dickerson and Paul-Ben Victor are all worth watching in small cameo roles.Some comedies do have depth...even filthy ones. A great comedy can actually have a really great story that you invest yourself in. Think of John Hughes who was a master of making comedy that you cared about. Get Hard has its moments but depth...nope. It is very very shallow. The characters, the ridiculous plot, the plot holes (why are they letting a convicted felon have thirty days to put his affairs in order?) But no one should be walking into this looking for a thinking man's film. I also didn't think there were a lot of laugh out loud moments but they definitely go for shock comedy with outrageous language, disgusting nudity and a little bit of physical comedy too which I always enjoy. This is director Etan Cohen's first big film and it does show in some ways because the movie feels a little disjointed at times given the comedic talent involved.

22,lesleyharris30,"Two Likable Leads aren't Enough to Save this Formulaic, Unfunny Comedy,",3,9 January 2016,"Get Hard is a hurrendous movie with a really poorly developed storyline, and a talented comedic cast that sadly aren't enough to make this film any better. There are very few things about this movie I enjoyed, and the only reason I'm not rating it even lower is because Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart are a likable duo, there was nothing irritating about them, they simply weren't given a good script, I liked seeing them together and I would hope we can see them in a genuinely good comedy in the future. The plot is uneven and I never found myself caring for the characters, but I could have looked past this if it was funny, but it certainly was not, there is a plot for the beginning and the end, but in the middle we are just watching one character help another one ""prepare for prison"", leading to a bunch of scenes that were simply dumb to say the least. James is a very unlikeable lead character, even at the hands of Ferrell I could not like him in any way, he's selfish, pompous and, at times, quite racist, this personality and attitude he has never matures or changes in any way, because of that I couldn't care for him or this story in any way. As a fan of both Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, I would recommend that other fans avoid this movie, you will be let down, Get Hard is a boring, unfunny ninety minutes. After being sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, successful millionaire James turns to Darnell, a down on his luck family man, to help him prepare for life in prison.

It really didn't give me light, instead it gives me a dark sense on how this world can have full of hateful people like the neo Nazi's. Also the rape jokes were definitely uncalled for. Seriously they should joke about something innocent rather being too heavy all the time. I found this film really offensive and seriously overrated.

I am a huge Will Ferrell fan and this seemed like a perfect role for him. I have to admit I was a little disappointed. Ferrell and Hart were really funny in this but to me the movie seemed a little forced. The idea is a really good sit-com idea but stretched out to an hour forty-five it really loses steam. There are some really funny parts in this, as well as some very shocking scenes but really this one felt like they were trying way too hard and it came across as forced.

James laps these lessons up until he learns Darnell lacks credentials.With every joke revolving around jailhouse sex or racial stereotypes, Get Hard has a hard time getting beyond its puerile mindset, making the laughs sporadic at best.

Yes kind of similar theme, but there's a lot of difference. The concept was the same and the story happens in an alternate way like 'what if'. That means one takes place outside the prison and the other one in the prison. If you're a movie fanatic, you would enjoy the show other than going after flaws and resemblance.I had seen many weird combos, and I felt same feeling for this Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, when I first heard about it. Like usual, once I watched the movie seem to be okay. Quite a show and equally good, one of the funniest combinations to entertain. I had a few good laughs and enjoyed the film. I would love to get a sequel for this, because these men coming together are double fun. So it should not be wasted ending with a one-off movie, but at least a duology or maybe a trilogy.

28,sol-,Hardening,6,26 December 2016,"Framed for a white collar crime, a wealthy pompous buffoon hires an African American acquaintance to train him for prison life in this Will Ferrell/Kevin Hart comedy vehicle. 'Get Hard' is not exactly a high concept movie and Ferrell's character trajectory is fairly predictable from the get-go, however, the film offers a surprisingly large amount of laughs with Hart in fine form and Edwina Findley Dickerson sassy as his wife. A memorable scene has Hart and Ferrell mistaken for a gay couple with their use of the title phrase out of context, though Hart's training sequences are what stand out most vividly afterward. In a kooky touch, Ferrell allows Hart to turn his mansion into a makeshift prison as part of the training, complete with bars, phone queue and moody inmates (played with relish by Ferrell's disgruntled servants). Hart also has an awesome scene in which he pretends to be three different courtyard criminals at once - something that confuses Ferrell so much that he begins genuinely conversing with all three personae as if they were in fact three different people. The film unfortunately runs out of steam around halfway in with only so much humour possible from Ferrell's bungled attempts to act tough. Ferrell's ""unorthodox style of cussing"" (as Hart describes it) also grows incredibly irksome as the film wears on. The climax on board a yacht is pretty well done though with all of Ferrell's training finally paying off. Craig T. Nelson additionally makes for a pitch perfect smarmy antagonist even if his crookedness is telegraphed from a little too early in the proceedings.",Get Hard
29,Floated2,Expected more comedy,4,23 January 2016,"Get Hard where we see Will Ferrell playing a clueless master of the universe (James King). He manages a hedge fund, dwells in a Bel Air mansion and is betrothed to a gold digger (Alison Brie), who insists they need an even bigger place. After police burst into James' birthday bash and arrest him for fraud, he's offered a plea deal — but, being clueless and innocent, he underestimates the court's frustration with white-collar crime. Instead of being cleared, he's sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin.Considering the talent level, the film isn't funny with no laughs and a predictable storyline and jokes. Such as, if a comedy pertains to prison, someone will make a joke about rape. So the concept central to Get Hard, a character preferring not to be raped in prison, is hardly new. Get Hard doesn't feel very long, and although the film isn't funny, the chemistry between Ferrell and Hart are okay enough to keep watching.

But Will Farell playing the innocent and well meaning guy, who is set up for fraud and he is about to go to prison. If you don't expect much from the movie, then maybe you'll have a good time.

31,leonblackwood,Not brilliant but funny in parts. 5-10,5,16 August 2015,"Review: This movie has a few funny scenes but it isn't anything amazing. The jokes or more silly than funny and the far fetched storyline, goes a bit too far sometimes. Anyway, it's about a stock market tycoon who gets nailed for fraud by his boss, who happens to be his girlfriends father. James (Ferrell) thinks that his father-in-law is going to help him to prove his innocence but his 30 day probation period is quickly running out and he doesn't know anything about prison life. This is when he turns to Darnell (Kevin Hart) who owns a small car wash company in the car park of James company. Darnell then turns to his gangster cousin for some information on jail life and then he puts James through some intense training on how to survive in prison. The movie reminded me a lot of Trading Places, were Dan Aykroyd was framed for the same type of thing. This movie isn't in the same league as Trading Places but I did giggle at a couple of the jokes. Ferrell uses the same mannerisms and phrases that we have seen in a lot of his movies and Kevin Hart also put in an average performance but it is watchable and the chemistry between the two actors was quite good. Its basically a light hearted adult comedy which does have a few offensive jokes but you will enjoy it if you don't take it too seriously. Average!Round-Up: Will Ferrell definitely has a unique style of acting which is second too none but his jokes are starting to become a bit tedious, like Carrey, Sandler and Stiller. Personally, I do find him quite funny and he always pushes a joke to the extreme but he's beginning to become type casted, which is never good for a comedian. He has to be one of the hardest working comedians in the business with 13 movies in the pipeline and many TV appearances, which includes movies made for TV so at 48 years old, he isn't showing any signs of slowing down in the near future. Kevin Hart, 36, has really shot to fame since the release of his stand-up film Let Me Explain. His career started in 2002 in a movie called Paper Soldiers and he also played the lead in Soul Plane which was a hit at the time. I do find his acting quite annoying at times but he wasn't too bad in this film. It seems like someone has had a word with him about his million word per minute habit which I got fed up with in his earlier movies. The film was directed by Ethan Cohen who wrote Men In Black 3, Tropic Thunder, which was a great movie and Idiocracy which was strange but funny. This is his first movie in the directors chair and I honestly think that he didn't do a bad job with it. It won't go down as a classic but it's a watchable movie which has some funny moments. Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $106millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies about a stock market tycoon who gets framed for fraud so he turns to a black car wash owner to prepare him for life in prison. 5/10",Get Hard

34,stevendbeard,Laugh Out Loud,7,27 March 2015,"I saw ""Get Hard"", starring Will Ferrell-The Lego Movie, Land of the Lost_2009; Kevin Hart-Ride Along, Soul Plane; Alison Brie-Community_tv, Mad Men_tv and Craig T. Nelson-Soul Surfer, Blades of Glory.I think Will Ferrell is funny sometimes. And sometimes, he's just not. This is one of the times where he is actually funny. Maybe, it's because he has a good co-star in Kevin Hart. Anyway, this movie is based- loosely-on a Rob Schneider movie called 'Big Stan', that was released straight to DVD in 2007-in it, Rob was going to prison and being afraid that he would not survive long, he hired David Carradine to train him in the martial arts. In this movie, Will is an investment adviser that works for multi-millionaire Craig and he is also engaged to Craig's daughter, Alison. Kevin works on keeping the cars of these millionaires clean-he has his business in the basement of their building. Will gets framed for bilking money from his clients and is sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin-the judge wants to make an example of him by giving him a hard sentence. The judge does give him 30 days to get his affairs in order so Will asks Kevin to toughen him up before he goes into prison-he does not think he will survive the harsh prison life. He also thinks that Kevin has been in prison previously because he is black and statistics show that 1 out of 3 black men have been-or will be-in prison. Kevin needs money for his business and takes on the challenge. I laughed quite a bit but be warned, sometimes the humor is a little graphic-I remember in particular a bathroom scene involving fellatio that was both hilarious and cringe worthy. It's rated ""R"" for language, drug use, sexual content-including nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Get Hard

The premise sees a millionaire who is being sent to prison attempt to get the help from a man he believes to be a former inmate to help tutor him for prison. Will Ferrell plays the lead in this film and he was fine, just at times he didn't seem his comedic best and didn't really make me laugh that much. His character was pretty ridiculous as well which for this film didn't fully help, but he is still will Ferrell and delivered a decent performance. I love Kevin hart and in this film he is good, he is funny but it does seem like he plays the same thing in every film and there is an aspect to his character that I wish they had extended in the film. For his small role ti was really good as well and I wouldn't mind seeing him in more things. Unfortunately all the villains are cookie cutter and predictable from a mile away. The story is really basic, you can tell from the premise alone just where the film is going and how it will end up. The script did have some funny moments but it never made me burst out laughing like I know Ferrell and hart can do. The style is ridiculous and it works half the time but the other half you really wonder why they went so ridiculous.

38,jimbo-53-186511,"Some aspects of it feel forced and unnecessary, but it still managed to register some big laughs with me",6,12 June 2016,"James King (Will Ferrell) is a wealthy stockbroker with a seemingly perfect and enviable lifestyle (big house, hot girlfriend etc). However, things come to a head when evidence is found to show that King has committed acts of fraud and embezzlement. In order to make an example out of him and to show that 'rich people' won't get an easy ride, the judge sentences King to the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison at San Quentin which is one of America's toughest prisons. King isn't prepared for life in prison and based on a conversation that he has with Darnell (Kevin Hart) he makes the assumption that Darnell has been to prison before and King offers to pay Darnell $30,000 dollars to toughen up ready for prison life which King will be facing in the next 30 days. Being hugely in debt and for his family's sake, Darnell agrees to prepare King for life in prison (even though he's never been in prison in his life!!!).Both Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart have both been hit and miss actor's in my book and therefore I approached this film with some caution and actually feared the worst. However, after watching it I thought it was much better than I expected it to be - although it isn't without it's fair share of problems....The storyline is fairly generic and there's definitely a whiff of Trading Places about it (it only really steals one aspect from that film rather than feeling like a 'rip-off' of that film). If you're expecting to see much originality in the material then you're going to be a little disappointed - quite a bit of the material is recycled prison clichés and much of this is witnessed when Darnell puts King through his toughening up boot-camp.Despite some of these problems there were some parts of the film that got some big laughs from me; I couldn't help but laugh at the scenes where King tries to pick fights with people at the park (with one scene where he picks on an old man and gets his ass kicked). I also loved the part where Martin (Craig T Nelson) is talking about how he built his successful business with just a computer, hard work and an $8,000,000 loan from his dad - it doesn't sound that funny when it's put in writing, but the way Nelson delivers the gag does make it funny. It's stuff like this that helps to take the edge of the cruder stuff that is witnessed at other moments in the film.Another strength with this film lies with the performances of Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart. The former is actually very good at acting as a 'whiny' jerk (perhaps too good), but in a film like Get Hard this style of acting works to his advantage and it really is hard not to laugh at some of the things that he says and does here. Hart is not someone who I've been too kind to in the past, but I think that I've never really seen him in a role that I've felt that he can put his own stamp on (until now). In some ways I thought that Hart steals the show here and in some ways seeing a much smaller figure like Hart being physically dominant over someone as large as Ferrell somehow made the scenario funnier to me. Both these actors share brilliant chemistry together and in some ways their physical humour and terrific performances overcome the fairly weak story.I've been generally positive with this film so far but I think it's important to draw your attention to some weaknesses with the film. Whilst it clearly relies on race issues to carry it in the early stages it always feels palatable (a basic misunderstanding based on 'race' is what lead to King making his assumption). This, for me, was tolerable in order to set the story up, but later in the film it starts to go off the rails a little bit by providing us with some forced and unnecessary moments (I felt that the scenes with The Crenshaws and The Alliances Of Whites) were a little too much and I don't feel that they were particularly necessary. It's also predictable and isn't funny often enough for me to be able to shout its praise from the rooftops.With all that being said though, some of the material is funny, Ferrell and Hart are both excellent here and the chemistry between the two men is first-rate. It's not brilliant, but on the same note it was funny enough for me.",Get Hard

Yet it's bad that although the major plot is blatantly laid out smack dab right in the title and the trailers, the movie sure took quite some time in building the story until it hit the main conflict. This makes the first stages of the movie quite boring, particularly because it takes ample amount of time to give each of the characters a significant deal of character introduction, whereas those roles are really movie stereotypes; one man is the one who doesn't realize he's being played a fool, and the other one is the desperate who does everything to get money. But the jokes are indeed funny, and for me those jokes are the ones that kept me watching. The acting overall is a bit above standards. Though Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell are only using their own usual characters, and not adding anything new to their roles, I like how the mix of those characters give color and life to the movie.",Get Hard
42,rgkarim,Get Hard Tries Too Hard To Be Funny,5,27 March 2015,"It seems like comedies are trying just about anything to get a laugh these days, scraping the bottom of the barrel for potential plots. As a result we get movies like Unfinished Business, Ride Along, and now Get Hard. To help breathe some life into the ridiculous tale the trailers show, the casting department has roped comedic legends Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell to help pull in some box office bucks. From the trailers you might expect:  A comedy about stereotypical prison motifs  Strong racist jokes that most likely know no bounds  Crappy plot that is usual of both of these actors  Same old comedy styles of the actorsSo what do you get? I can report the first two points are the strongest themes of this movie. The plot for those who don't know is about Will Ferrell's character James being arrested for embezzling and fraud. The eccentric and arrogant millionaire has 30 days to get his affairs in order, which involves learning to survive in prison by local car washer Darnell (Kevin Hart). Already you might be cringing, but I admit some of the prison humor is creative, in particular the prison setup itself. I laughed more at the setting itself than the actual jokes, due to the simplistic setup and irony of James' staff being the wardens. Unfortunately the jokes weren't as entertaining, most of the scenes were shown in the trailers and those that weren't, focused on the same joke themes of sex, sex, and a little prison fighting. Coat all of these jokes with curse-laden frosting and you get a mediocre comedy whose only break comes from Ferrell's ridiculous rants. For your information, the prison riot scene has some intense strobe light action, which may precipitate seizures. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. How do they attempt to keep the prison jokes fresh? By adding every racial profile and stereotype joke you can think of. Get Hard spares no expense to poke fun at our perspectives of folks that end up in prison. Over the 100 minutes, you'll get pummeled with mannerisms and lingo that are often associated with African thug life, including Ferrell trying on his ""black face"" as he calls it. They even threw in a few thug track lists to help seal the deal, some of the songs I do like. I chuckled at a few of these jokes, particular at Hart's little impressions he plays so well, however like the prison jokes these too became stale, losing their comedic edge. Most of the jokes will be taken okay, but like always they occasionally overstep their boundaries with their jokes, perhaps starting another boycott for racial slurs. So here I warn that if you are easily offense by color jokes, you should skip this movie.To my surprise the plot actually wasn't half bad in this film. Get Hard has some a decent foundation for the jokes to hold anchor to mainly in the form of shaping James from pompous wuss into street champion. However there is a cute tale of brotherhood that adds some depth to otherwise one-dimensional characters and gives a little something else to the film, though not as good as Wedding Ringer. Yet it still is shallow and simplistic, and doesn't have the emotional kick I would have liked to see. Acting wise there isn't much unique about this performance. Hart takes a step back towards his roots with a few shouting rants interspersed with his typical F bomb dialog. Fortunately he hasn't returned all the way back, managing to dial down his craziness with some clever lines and good comedic timing. This allowed me to once again enjoy his comedy without wanting to punch his face in or rip my ears off, a positive thing indeed.. I can't say the same for Ferrell though. Somehow the hairy, homely looking white guy gets a hot woman and other than money I can't figure out why? Babes aside though, Ferrell is still the pompous, overconfident boob he always plays in his movies. He still carries his lines with that air of superiority, though in this installment he frequently degrades into a whiney, pathetic baby. I felt he tried to hard in this movie, forcing his lines on me instead of perfecting the delivery like he used to do. Much of his lines were in that high pitched whisper from Elf, only without the over-energetic emphasis that Buddy had so long ago.If you haven't guessed it yet, I did not enjoy this movie as much I had hoped. Get Hard is indeed another simplistic comedy, where one is bombarded by endless jokes and derogative laughs. Sure it is fun at first, but most of the funny parts were shown in the trailers, and without the course language. Yet for those who love the comedians' work, you'll most likely laugh your heads off with the racial profanities and prison slapstick. You'll enjoy it even more if you are drunk. Overall the choice is yours, but I recommend saving your money and catching this movie on RedBox in a few months. Believe me you can wait. My scores are:Comedy: 6.0 Movie Overall: 5.0",Get Hard

Instead of using the typical sex humor and innuendo that the most R-rated comedies are known for, they take advantage of using racist humor. Nearly joke the two spit out revolves around African Americans, Jews, or other sort of ethnic group. The film uses so much racial and religious stereotyping, with one racist joke after another after another, and it gets so repetitive. One scene in particular takes place at a Nazi Club, where there is a group of gangsters dressed up in these biker-style Nazi suits of some sort. Watching this scene just made me roll my eyes. I'm not gonna lie, some of the dialogue made me laugh. Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell have several good lines here and there. The only thing is that if this film veered more on clever sex jokes rather than dumb racist humor, it would have been more enjoyable.If you are a fan of Will Ferrell or Kevin Hart, I would recommend this film. However, if you are easily offended by racist humor than this may not be a good pick.",Get Hard
46,Pumpkin_Man,Another Instant Will Ferrell Classic!!!,10,27 March 2015,"Will Ferrell has always been one of my favorite comedians, and Kevin Hart has been growing on me the past few years. Both of them together was a laugh riot! I'll admit, it started out a little slow, but got immediately better once they team up on screen. Obviously, this movie isn't trying to win any awards. It is what it is, just a plain ol' funny silly laugh out loud gross-out comedy to enjoy with your friends, so don't judge it too harshly. There are quite a few racist jokes, so if you're easily offended, stay away. Ferrell stars as James King, a rich businessman who is wrongfully accused of tax evasion. He's given 30 days to get his affairs in order. He soon hires Darnell (Hart) to prep him and get him ready for prison (even though Darnell has never been to prison) What follows are hilarious and awkward situations like faking a prison riot, starting fights with strangers, and much more. If you love Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, I highly recommend GET HARD!!!",Get Hard

48,areatw,Two great comedy actors wasted on crap material,4,1 June 2017,"Will Ferrell is one of my favourite actors but this has to be a low point in his career. 'Get Hard' is disappointing by any standards, but the fact that one of the best comedy actors in Ferrell is effectively wasted in such a dumb film makes it even worse. 'Get Hard' is some seriously crap material.There are some funny scenes in this film, most of them towards the end, but this is down to the actors alone and not the material. Ferrell and Hart and two naturally funny people who have an effortless ability to make people laugh and they are the only thing about this film that makes it remotely watchable. If two less talented actors worked with this material, it would have been a train wreck.",Get Hard
49,blott2319-1,Offensive and unfunny even though the concept had promise,3,26 August 2020,"The concept of Get Hard is funny, so it feels like this movie should work at least to some degree. Will Ferrell plays a clueless guy who is going to jail for white collar crimes, and he just assumes the guy who washes his car (played by Kevin Hart) has gone to prison before. So he hires this blue collar guy to prepare him for prison, not realizing that Hart is one of the most straightlaced normal people you could ask for and has never even been arrested. I feel like part of the reason the film didn't quite click for me was the fact that Will Ferrell seems to have his entire performance turned up to 11. He is not subtle in any way and instead of making the movie more humorous it is actually less funny when he goes to these extremes. On the flip side the one time Kevin Hart takes his performance up a notch (with some clear improv) it is actually good for a few laughs, but most of the way through he's forced to be the straight man. Another problem with Get Hard is that it doesn't take the time to address the extreme racism of certain parts of the plot, to the point that the movie treats it as more of a betrayal when Hart lies about his experience with prison than when Ferrell assumes he has gone there because of the color of his skin.The ""training"" that commences is all over the place and feels utterly moronic, which should be fine based on the premise of the film, because neither of these guys know anything about going to prison. Yet we're meant to believe that this series of odd training techniques does start to teach the main character how to survive. In fact, he becomes so in touch with the idea of prison life that he starts to teach himself some extra tricks that he feels will come in handy. The number of ""jokes"" that come merely from the fact that he has learned to hold things up his butt, is kind of embarrassing. There are a couple of fun scenes in the film that saved me from utter boredom and disgust. The biggest highlight was probably when this successful stock trader teaches a gang how to invest their money in the stock market in order to make millions, and they go on to have serious arguments with one another about the handling of different stocks. Otherwise, the plot of this film is so basic that I could predict exactly where it was going from the first scene, and it was just a matter of waiting to see what kind of stupid stuff would happen on the way to that conclusion. I've certainly hated comedies more than this one, but Get Hard did nothing to make me like it either.",Get Hard
50,Aktham_Tashtush,"The movie has an organized plot, the events flows smoothly, and there are more than enough of loudly laughable scenes .. ;)",8,17 June 2015,"Well it started a bit mild ,, showing Will Ferrell's ass and some absurd scenes were aimless and had no much of affections what so ever on my comic sense. Kevin Hart's start was okay ,, funny with his daughter scene. then things escalated so fast after the arrest, trial ,verdict counting days down till ""Darnell"" finds ""James"" in the car trunk .. then things just got a bit wildly funny with the act of he's getting rape in prison, ,, with the racial comments. So the funny bits starts when the steps of turning ""James"" into getting badass Hard ... then a bit of the truth comes out in 1st third of the movie ""like who really set him up !!"" and simultaneously Ferrell's jokes get really funny,,,, Kevin's three personality act was so damn hilarious acting he's Mexican and black and gay and making a funny scene out of that :D In general the movie splits into three parts ,, the into part where we get to know the two lives of ""James"" and ""Darnell"",, the second part where ""James"" is being prepared to get Hard and the last part where lies the mission of proving ""James"" innocence.The story of the movie is new the plot is mostly tight along the movie, the script is for me rated Okay for comedy there are some really strong laughable scenes and there are the mild funny ones but overall the chemistry and the assigned script for all the characters worked so fine and proper.As for the Cast; the dual of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell is spot on and i really with to see more of that .. Kevin is a star rising so high in Hollywood and he really pushed himself so good to be this funny... As for Ferrell i mean no need to say that he was awesome cuz he was.Overall,, the movie is organized and hilarious in most parts and really enjoyable .. so recommended.",Get Hard
51,phubbs,Get Hard,4,12 June 2015,"Another throwaway comedy from Ferrell? yeah pretty much. Despite the fact this guy is mega famous and has made some solid movies, his filmography is top heavy with throwaway garbage, literately littered with trashy flicks. I find it weird that three of his worst movies happen to be about various sporting events, ice skating, tennis and NASCAR racing.So lets be honest here this movie is simply one big stereotype, one big cliché, every angle is nailed well and truly...almost to an offensive level. Put simply, Ferrell plays a rich successful businessman who works for a large company. He has it all including a mansion, flashy automobile, slick suits and a hot fiancée, he is on top of the world. Then as quickly as his lavish lifestyle is presented to us, its all torn down as he is accused of corruption. He now has 30 days until he goes to jail for the next ten years. In desperation he turns to humble car washer Kevin Hart for help, his request? to train him for prison life, to get him hard, tough, butch. At the same time Ferrell's character must also try to figure out how he was busted when he is innocent.I don't wanna sound overly politically correct mainly because I can't stand the modern extremist PC trend, but damn is this entire story just one big insult. I mean lets look at the actual premise, Ferrell's character is a stereotypical rich, smart, white character, Kevin Hart is actually a hard working honest black character. Yet King (Ferrell) goes to Lewis (Hart) for help simply because he is a black man and he automatically assumes he will know about being in prison, criminal life, or automatically assumes he has been to prison. Right there you have a bit of a no no technically, not a great start.From there on Lewis helps King train for prison, this naturally entails every single stereotypical prison cliché in the book. All prison inmates are automatically assumed to be either black or hispanic/latino with all the regular well known clichés that accompany that outlook. You know exactly what I mean, virtually all the characters are big, tattooed, gold teeth, bling, baggy pants around the hips, shades, silly headgear and loads of profanity and street lingo. Of course revolving around prison there will also be lots of homosexual references, gags, innuendos and slapstick. One sequence actually shows King trying his hand at oral sex on a man! he doesn't actually do it of course but we do actually see a penis! full screen! was it fake? looked real to me. But its not just people of colour that are hit, to counter the black and latino gangs there are of course the stereotypical redneck, black leather clad, white biker gangs just so no one feels left out.What's funny is even the presentation of Ferrell's character is a slightly offensive or annoying stereotype. A weedy, wussy, straight- laced, well spoken, college grad type that is unable to interact with lower income people and treats them like slave labour. All the people that clean his huge mansion appear to be Mexicans and all the workers in Ferrell's company are white, not a single person of colour to be seen. The black street gang the duo visit for help later in the movie are the epitome of movie stereotypes (the women with the gang are all dressed and act like sluts etc...). This entire movie is enough to give all the social justice warriors out there a heart attack. The fact that we all know deep down most of this is kinda accurate to reality anyway isn't the point (it really isn't), everything we see is so tired, old, formulaic and unoriginal its just not really funny.The story isn't even particularly relatable or realistic anyway which affects the comedy. The first scenes we see of King revolve around his luxurious lifestyle, so basically its just like watching Will Ferrell in his own real life because we all know these movie stars live in massive abodes, driving supercars with hot partners. Later on in the movie as King's training becomes more intense they actually convert his home into a makeshift prison? Putting bars on windows, electrified barbwire fencing and spotlights around the grounds, creating a cell, using his cleaners as prison wardens etc...I realise its just a dumb comedy going for laughs but would anyone really go to those lengths? it just seems like stretching for a visual gag. Indeed most of the jokes here solely rely on really grasping for laughs with forced visual tomfoolery, or they just bank on the old racist, homophobic, sexist angle to win the day.Admittedly there were a few moments that made me smile, a few bits of dialog that made me chuckle, I can't recall them now but it happened. The second half the film gets a bit better as we discover how and why King got set up, although this doesn't enhance Craig T.Nelson's role in the movie, nor does it explain his decision for being here in the first place. The one thing I did like about the film was the fact its an adult movie with adult things...like some nice moments of tits n ass (sexist remark is recognised, hypocrisy noted). In this day and age I'm actually stunned this type of movie is allowed to go ahead and the fact it actually did well! Yes its good to laugh at ourselves and each other, no harm in that, but these days is risky lets not beat around the bush. Bottom line everyone knows what they're getting into with this, its all quite intentional and they do hit their marks, but that doesn't mean its good.4.5/10",Get Hard
52,MuviFan73,An underrated adult comedy!,8,3 December 2018,Don't go with what critics have to say. The preparation (to be in jail) what main character goes through and his trainer lay down a good comedic path. The adult nature of humor is tremendous and can be projected for a bigger audience. The music is good as well.,Get Hard
53,bankofmarquis,Hart and Ferrell team up well,7,4 April 2015,"Will Ferrell is an acquired taste. Either you like his humor, his ability to just ""go for it"" or you don't. Such is the case with GET HARD. If you like Ferrell, you'll like this movie. If you don't, don't waste your time.The surprise to me, in this movie, was Kevin Hart. He, basically, is the star of this movie with Ferrell playing the straight man. That is, until Ferrell ""breaks loose."" Which means the first 3/5 of the movie is Hart's - and he hold our attention, and the humor, quite well. But it is in a scene about 3/5 of the way in the movie that Ferrell finally lets go - and he lets go in one of the funniest sequences I have ever scene. I cannot describe the scene here for it is VERY politically incorrect, VERY adult and VERY funny. This scene is worth the price of admission alone.I turn into about a 14 year old kid when Ferrell is at the top of his game, and - at times - he is in this movie with Hart providing enough backup humor to make this flick worth watching.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Get Hard
54,Ruskington,Not as bad as it could have been I guess,5,1 August 2020,"For some reason, I continue to put myself through these dreadful Will Ferrell movies even though the standard gets worse with every release. Get Hard is certainly not the worst film Ferrell has been involved in and actually has some good moments. Kevin Hart works well as the co-star even though he is basically just being himself.The gay rape jokes are instantly tiresome and I'm surprised the cancel crew haven't had this wiped from existence already. I can handle offensive comedy but it has to be at least funny and preferably original and this is neither. As with nearly all these modern comedies, the writing is just so unoriginal and half-hearted. Cheap and tasteless, but fine if you want to zone out to some easy viewing",Get Hard
55,bob-the-movie-man,Funnier than expected,7,7 July 2015,"Get Hard was a film I really wasn't expecting to like much, but it was significantly funnier than I expected it to be. Will Ferrell's films have had a tendency to be a bit like Russian Roulette as of late, but this one is fortunately one with no bullet in the chamber. Ferrell plays James, a market trader with (in some people's books) an idyllic life: beautiful house, beautiful fiancée (the boss's daughter) and more money that Trump could shake a stick at.But the idyll is shattered when he is arrested and then convicted of corruption on a massive scale. Wanting to set a public example , the judge sentences him to the delights of San Quentin and James has 30 days to ""Get Hard"" before being thrown to the mercy of the inmates. Helping him in the task is Kevin Hart (""Ride Along"") who, primarily for reasons of personal financial gain, pretends to be much more 'street' than he really is.What I enjoyed about this film was the leisurely set up of character and plot before the real comedy (the 'training') kicked in. This is where Ferrell and Hart really work together well, and I thought Hart was excellent in his role. Also good to see Craig T. Nelson (""Poltergeist"", ""Blades of Glory"") back on the big screen as James's boss.There are few films where I have guffawed out loud so much at certain points: some really good visual slapstick humour. However, the film will be far from everyone's tastes, with some very close to the knuckle jokes. In particular things come to a 'head', as it were, with some mano-a-mano action between Ferrell and Matt Walsh (""VEEP"", ""Into the Storm""), where the crudometer gets cranked up to ""Farrelly"". The film is also let down by a weak ending and if there was a joke to be had in the last line of the film, it completely flew over my head.Recommended for some good belly laughs for the broad minded.(If you enjoyed this review please see the graphical version at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email address to get future reviews.

56,bryank-04844,Just Awful.,1,6 May 2015,"Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart have teamed up together for their latest comedy project called 'Get Hard' with enough double entendres for two movies. There are a couple of similarities from 'Trading Places' and 'Nothing To Lose' here in 'Get Hard', but nothing really seems genuine or charming enough to remember this film much beyond two minutes after viewing it. Etan Cohen (not to be confused of the Coen Bros.) steps into the director's seat for the first time, but has written screenplays such as 'Men In Black III', 'Tropic Thunder', and 'Idiocracy'. Clearly, he has some writing talent, but with 'Get Hard', it seems like he just let Ferrell and Hart do their own thing, which can be outrageously funny at times, but can also run off on long tangents, which often happens with this movie.This movie survives and fails by its overdone racial, gender, and sexual humor, all of which has been done many times before this film. It's a tired and exhausting trope with these new comedies, however Hart and Ferrell's chemistry is quite good. The setup is with James King (Ferrell), an extremely wealthy investment banker who is as white bred as they come. He lives in a giant house with his materialistic fiancée Alissa (Alison Brie) and works at a large investment firm where his boss Martin (Craig T. Nelson) is also his future father-in-law.Things look good for James until the authorities arrest James at work for securities fraud and embezzlement. He sticks to his guns that he is innocent and was framed, but the judge gives him ten years in prison. Now James has 30 days until he has to report to prison, and being the guy he is, won't last a day in jail. That's when he enlists the help of the black guy who washes his car, Darnell (Hart) for help, because according to James, 1 out of every 3 black people will end up in jail at some point.What kind of help does James want from Darnell, who secretly has grown up in the suburbs, far from any street gangs? It's the kind of help that will make James ""get hard"" or get tough enough so he will be able to avoid rape and murder in prison, which is apparently all that happens when doing hard time, according to to these two characters. So over a few montage scenes of physical training, shoving things in your rectum, and a gay brunch out on the town where oral sex is highly likely, we see Darnell toughen up James.That is until Darnell finally believes that James is innocent and tries to help him clear his name. Nothing in this movie really makes any sense. Everything is over-the-top and tries to hard to be funny, outrageous, and vulgar. I think certain people will try to say this is homophobic and somewhat racist, but I disagree. These are comedians who are using the stereotypes for comedy, but never in a hurtful way. It's all in good fun, but it outstays it's welcome early on. The only thing that matters with this film are Ferrell and Hart, as every other plot device and character are only given a couple of minutes of screen time with no real resolution or point to why anything is happening on screen.'Get Hard' is the product of two very talented comedic actors who made a movie where they basically have no script and given free reigns to just riff one joke off another for two hours. There are some minor laughs and at least one scene that has Ferrell literally on his knees, deciding on whether or not to go all the way in, but it's not enough to make the entire film memorable or even that good.",Get Hard
57,witster18,"Save yourself the time and money and watch the superior original, ""Big Stan""",4,31 July 2015,"Don't get me wrong.. If you ask Rob Schneider or Will Ferrell, whether it be overall funniness or filmography, I'm taking Ferrell, but not here.Get Hard starts out rough. Unfunny and uninteresting. Trying way ""too hard"" with a script that just had nothing to offer.Granted, the film makes a mild comeback in the second half. Ferrell's antics finally go over-the-top and make the second-half nearly re-watchable, but not quite. At present this may be the worst film I know-of that's still sitting above a 6.0 on IMDb, but give it three more weeks of DVD time and it might drop closer to where it should be.47/100 It's the second under-whelming comedy I've rented this week from A- listers. ""Unfinished Business"" also left a lot to be desired(a tad better than this crap). ""Get Hard"" WAS better than HTTM2, but that's not a difficult task. This film also relied a bit too much on crude humor. And that's weird that I just used crude humor as a negative, and then referenced ""Big Stan"" as a better film. I don't mind crude humor - as long as it's funny. I nearly turned it off about 45-in, and I try ""really hard"" NOT to do that when watching a movie. It's gotta be pretty darn awful. If it didn't star Hart and Ferrell I WOULD have turned-it-off, but I thought I'd give them a chance at redemption and they did salvage a little face in the second-half.Lazy writing. WIthout the physical comedy of it's leads it's in the Turkey/1-2 area.I'd pass.You don't expect too much plot with these types of films, but the finish of the story is so dull yet somehow also hurried, and the films only saving grace is some physical comedy and decent chemistry from the leads. Too bad they didn't have a script worth 2 cents.You thought the Horror Genre was dying... uh uh.. the comedy genre is what's dyin'. Anchorman this is not. Big Stan this is not.go buy a used copy of Big Stan(6.5/10) instead of dropping 1.50 on the redbox for this junk. All they did was try to remake it, and like most remakes, it's a huge step-down.

58,Shopaholic35,Funny at times.,6,12 April 2016,I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this movie. There were moments when I could not stop laughing but there were also times when the whole thing felt too forced. Will Ferrell tried to shock and gross you out too many times. Kevin Hart on the other hand was hilariously sweet as the family man. He gave energy to the film and stopped it from becoming totally low-brow.The overall story was fairly predicable but there were some nice surprises as well. Maybe if it hadn't been so awkward in places then I could have rated it higher. Also if I see Will Ferrell's butt one more time I will need to gouge out my eyeballs.

59,DareDevilKid,Outrageously Funny!,8,22 June 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsJames King (Ferrell) has it all - money, a beautiful fiancé (Alison Brie), and he's just been made partner in the investment firm started and run by his future father-in-law (Craig T. Nelson). He spares nothing on the finer things, including having his car detailed by Darnell Lewis (Hart), a man hoping to buy a new home for his family in a better neighborhood so that his little girl could attend a safer, more reputable school.Out of the blue, James is arrested for fraud. Though encouraged by his boss/future father-in-law to take a plea bargain, James refuses, insisting that he's totally innocent. Sadly, he is not believed, and the judge, looking to send a message to white collar criminals, sentences him to 10 years hard labor in a maximum penitentiary. With 30 days to get his affairs in order, James decides he needs to learn how to survive prison and decides to get advice from the only black man he knows.Outrageously funny, despite bordering on the offensive most of the way, ""Get Hard"" confirms the star-making talent shown by Kevin Hart in ""The Wedding Ringer"" and ""Ride Along"" as well as the consistently funny- film streak of Will Ferrell. Both are at the top of their game here, and their chemistry is quite obvious. What's refreshing is that both men are constantly entertaining and the script offers them scope to drive the film forward with a turbo thrust by feeding off each other's contrasting comic styles. Watch out for the scenes where Hart gives a one-man performance of ""Boys in the Hood"" when cornered by his family to tell Ferrell the story of how he went to prison, or when he enacts three different stereotypical inmates to give Ferrell a low-down on prison life. For Ferrell, his best scene occurs when he's urged by Hart to pick a fight with three beefed-up men in a park as part of his prison training. You're guaranteed to laugh yourself hoarse at their antics in these scenes.The script, co-written by director Cohen and Jay Martell along with Ian Roberts is constantly funny, even when it approaches the lines of race, homosexual, and other prejudicial stereotypes. Also, in spite of all the R-rated jokes and gags, there are some nice moments between Ferrell and Hart as well as Hart and his on-screen family. If you're looking for a rollicking laugh, ""Get Hard"" is the film to see.",Get Hard
60,The_Light_Triton,Get hard or get it where it hurts,4,21 April 2015,"I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell, but I'll admit he has made some really fun movies, and he made the Celebrity Jeopardy parodies on SNL a thing of legend, parodying Alex Trebek.But Get hard isn't one of those fun movies. It's actually a series of jokes, almost all of them in poor taste, with nary a laugh.Stock broker James King (Will Ferrell) is accused of fraud and embezzlement, and after turning down the option to admit to his guilt, gets sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin, the worst prison a man like him could ever get sent. Desperate to survive, He turns to Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) who washes his car every day, to get him ready for prison. However, being an entitled elitist, James automatically assumes Darnell was incarcerated simply due to the fact he's African American and that statistics show 1 in 3 African American men have been incarcerated. With a little financial incentive, Darnell begins training James on how to stay alive in prison.Unfortunately, movies like this one are dime-a-dozen and always have jokes in bad taste. I would need more than my 2 hands to count all the bad racial jokes and sexual innuendos that came through, none of which made me laugh.The worst part of this movie, is the riot training sequence, where Darnell sets up the lights to flash repeatedly to simulate a riot. I was sitting a few seats from the screen in the theatre and had to cover my face to avoid getting a seizure.And just so you know, I'm not epileptic.To be fair, there are some moments that caused me to chuckle, but nothing caused me to laugh out loud. Also, the ending is truly satisfying for what it's worth.But if you're looking to laugh, don't expect anything from this unless of course you like repetitive jokes and worn-out adult humor.4/10",Get Hard

This is going to be a short review for this garage movie, why well I haven't got anything else to say about it because why should I go into such much detail for this movie that I will not remember it in a few days time.The story is about a millionaire faces a prison sentence following a fraud conviction and in order to survive life behind bars, turns to Darnell Lewis to toughen up.Listen March has been a slow month for me because there are some of the new releases that I haven't checked out yet and yes I pretty much review movies everyday and I do have my breaks time again, but screw it life is short so start reviewing. The title ""Get Hard"" sounds like a porn video you will come across on PornHub.com, why can't they just called the movie Get tough or something like that, because people are going to take the title not very well and it would be really awkward to shout it out it in public. Anywhere with the other disappointments so far in March that I had interest that turned out to be a big massive f**k you to the auditions and me, and Get Hard can join those titles because this movie sucks.The jokes in the movie came off sexist and kind of racist and you should know by now that I can't stand those jokes because I can picture in my head that all these people out there are getting hurt by this and stupid humor is unacceptable.Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell are fine in the movie but I rather like to see them in better movies than this.

Now my BOL hated it, but my dad said it had a few good laughs, which I'd have to agree.Will Ferrell plays another one of his ditzy take-offs of some of his old SNL sketch characters- this time a well-to-do Hedge fund manager who finds out he'll be going to prison for a long time (a very long time) for embezzlement & fraud. To ""Get Hard"" or get ready for his time in the pen, he enlists the help of a car wash owner/acquaintance played by Kevin Hart, who he just assumes he's been in prison before, due to some slight racist tendencies.Will Ferrell has given us some good comedies- my favorites would probably have to be ""Talladega Nights"", ""Step Brothers"", ""Semi-Pro"", as well as the ""Anchorman"" films. He has also dabbled in some serio- dramatic films such as ""Stranger Than Fiction"" and ""Everything Must Go"", which were fine pieces of work too. So I see this movie as just another commercial buddy/comedy, probably taking his career back a bit. It's got a few laughs here and there, but there were some spots I'm thinking to myself, okay, can we hurry this up-??

He seeks Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) to teach him the ropes on life on the inside and keys to his survival. This movie is funny, and lots of good bits. Silly at times but you would expect that with these two lead characters. I enjoyed it and always enjoy a good belly laugh. I enjoyed the film and sometimes crime does pay. Will Ferrell shared all his funny style from his took box and kevin hart worked to keep up. But seems that funny is funny and this is a great film with a happy ending.",Get Hard
66,ArchonCinemaReviews,somehow the Comedic duo of the generation can make a really unfunny movie,4,7 April 2015,"No one wanted to like Get Hard more than Archon Cinema Reviews, but with the infrequent childish jokes and unoriginal story, we just couldn't.James King is a millionaire stock broker with it all, until he gets charged for fraud and sentenced to ten hard years at San Quentin. He asks Darnell Lewis to help him ""Get Hard"" to prepare for his stint behind bars.Veteran comedian Will Ferrell finally teams up with modern maverick Kevin Hart – the results should be magical. No one is more apt for the toe-to-toe banter and improv than Hart and Ferrell. And there are moments of comedy where the audience will chuckle to themselves and at the events these characters find themselves in. Unfortunately these moments border on forced sympathy, so desirous for a giggle that at the tiniest sliver of comedy it pushes itself to the audible surface.The plot device within Get Hard is not particularly new, a rich guy loses his riches and must adapt to hard life. Though, it was particularly popular in the late 1980's and early 1990's to coincide with the repugnant stock brokers of that age. Unfortunately, the film does not have a smart edge or seemingly any thought to its humor. Instead, it resorts to cliché stereotypes of urban life, gangs, and homosexuals. It is tasteless and cheap.Perhaps Get Hard suffers from overly high expectations thanks to the insurmountable talent of Hart and Ferrell. There is so much potential for a hilarious film, that it was bound to fail. The only good thing about Get Hard was the highly amusing film promotion method of these two actors.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Get Hard
67,bbewnylorac,Poor depiction of women spoils it,5,9 October 2015,"This is not a bad idea -- privileged white finance millionaire (Will Ferrell) is framed for fraud and is so scared of prison he hires a black acquaintance Darnell (Kevin Hart) to toughen him up so he'll survive. But it turns out Darnell has never been to prison, so the pair try all sorts of tricks - joining gangs and finally trying to clear Ferrell's character's name. The basic elements are there for a good movie and Hart is great, but Ferrell falls back too much on stereotypes. There is the old joke of being someone's boyfriend in prison, but the same joke is repeated, oh, about 100 times. And what about the women in this movie? Darnell's wife is the only decent, smart female depicted. The others are usually scantily clad ho's who are basically there for eye candy. Ferrell doesn't always do this -- Blades of Glory had good roles for Amy Poehler and Jenna Fischer, Talladega Nights had Jane Lynch, and Anchorman had Christina Applegate. Step Brothers had Mary Steenburgen. And the black characters in Get Hard are mostly depicted as gangsters. So overall it's very disappointing for a Ferrell film -- it is a little lazily scripted and not up to the best he can do.",Get Hard
68,LloydBayer,"Low on taste and high on slur, Get Hard is frustratingly flaccid all the way.",4,26 March 2015,"With a title like that, writer/director Etan Cohen (not to be confused with the Coen Brothers) has a specific audience in mind. So it comes as no surprise that Get Hard not only aims below the belt, sexual innuendos are rampant alongside stereotypical gags on race, gender and sexual orientation. But if that's your thing, then you are exactly the type of audience Cohen hopes to make a buck off.With the opening credits split into two frames, the insinuations are clear – Crime and poverty stricken Black America mounted by Ivy league White America. You could say this is pretty much the main theme before it all starts tasting sour. In the big white corner is James King (Will Farrell), a Harvard educated corporate bigshot with a big slice of the big life. In the tiny black corner is Darnell (Kevin Hart), a car washer barely making ends meet. Their worlds collide when King faces incarceration for fraud and embezzlement. Now facing 10 years 'hard' time (one of several references to the title) King seeks out the only person he thinks can help him – Darnell. Why? King assumes that a third of all black men will have been incarcerated in their lifetime. How? For the money, Darnell will groom King from a softy into a hardy. Hence the title Get Hard. Get it?Thus begins this mashup between two former stand-up comedians, each armed with a barrage of one-liners that I suspect was once used during their heydays on NBC's Saturday Night Live. With the biggest gag being King's fear of getting raped in prison, Cohen's setup is the 30 days of preparation before King becomes an inmate. Although few of these jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, most go flat even before the punchline is thrown. Seasoned delivery from Ferrell and Hart aside, the problem lies in Cohen's gags that are both outdated as well as overdone. It's one thing to read these jokes on a subway ride after work, but absolutely horrendous when materialized on screen. It doesn't help either that almost every joke told has been done before, in addition to a formulaic story where everyone in the audience knows King is framed and by whom.For all those who got a kick out of watching Farrell in Old School (I know I did), there's still a glimpse of that side splitting aptitude in him but Get Hard doesn't do much to get it out (think Steve Martin in Bringing Down the House). In comparison, Hart has more or less the edge here but falls victim too, to a sophomore effort from Cohen. Ultimately, it all comes down to taste. Even so, Get Hard is harsh on the ears and feeble on the brain, but frustratingly flaccid all the way.",Get Hard

It's a shame too. While this isn't Ferrell's best, it certainly isn't his worst. With him, you get the same old stuff...a shirtless scene, lots of goofy faces and his go-to character...a naïve guy caught up in a wacky situation. It's standard Ferrell.The laughs are cheap; ""unorthodox style of cussin'"", too many mad-dog faces and lots and LOTS of homos3xual jokes.I personally don't like Hart's comedy (with few exceptions, I don't like stand-up comedy at all...Pryor on the Sunset is a big exception) ...anyway, he's good here and the chemistry between the two is great.It all plays out exactly like you'd think...not a bad time-waster, but it's no Old School, Anchorman or Talladega Nights.Cheers.",Get Hard
70,Ramascreen,"Not funny, but clever!",7,28 March 2015,"With GET HARD, I was bracing myself for sitting uncomfortably through a movie that was going to be racists and full of gay and dick jokes, constantly bombarding me and to a certain extent, racism is a big chunk or GET HARD's jokes, but it's mostly at the expense of rich people's ignorance toward minority and vice versa. And I never thought I'd ever say this about a Will Ferrell movie, but GET HARD is clever and I'll explain why.Will Ferrell plays millionaire James King who's nailed for fraud and he request the help of the man who washes his car, Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) to prepare him for life behind bars. That's essentially the plot for GET HARD. Quite simple and straightforward. The humor isn't always funny, the racist jokes aren't always spot on. It would've been one thing if they were, after all comedy almost always gets a pass for everything, so I wouldn't have been easily offended either, but what GET HARD lacks in its ability to get you to even chuckle, it makes up for in its clever concept.To me, GET HARD is a satire on the one percenter, in one of the scenes, Will Ferrell's James King tells Kevin Hart's Darnell Lewis that hardwork, not handouts, pay off. But then there's another scene in which Will Ferrell's James King teaches urban black folks how to play stocks correctly and create wealth for themselves (even though the business they're in is shady) and that to me goes to show the mindset that one percenter has, they quickly dismiss the rest of us as lazy, when in fact sometimes all we need is just an investment to get ourselves started, sometimes all we need is somebody to teach us how to create wealth as well. The skills that these few rich claim to have, can be taught, they can be shared, they can be distributed, there's nothing exclusive about them. I don't remember having seen a comedy that tackles that, so I find myself pleasantly surprised by GET HARD. If that doesn't get you impressed, then what can do the trick is GET HARD's many ways of re-creating prison scenarios. It may not crack you up but it's interesting to see how a Bell-Air mansion gets transformed into a prison cell, prison yard and much more and they utilize the maids, the gardeners, the servants, posing as prison inmates, it's very creative.Will Ferrell is in his usual self, butt naked, crying loudly and hysterically, I really can't get myself laughing at his being himself anymore, and Kevin Hart, the man who pretty much fills the void that Eddie Murphy left behind, is also in his usual self, banking on his being short, black, and a fast-talker, and so GET HARD pretty much presents all you already know about both Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, but the concept is a hidden gem.Read more at Ramascreen.Com",Get Hard
71,gavinp9,"Enjoyable, simple comedy",7,2 January 2018,"'Get Hard' is a straightforward comedy film - rich white guy gets sentenced to jail for fraud, asks black associate to help him prepare for prison life, hijinks ensue. Obviously, it helps when you have two great comedic leads - Ferrell as James, the meek banker, and Hart as Darnell, the car-wash operator trying to support his family. Hart's on a bit of a roll, film-wise, but this was not quite as enjoyable as 'The Wedding Ringer', but much better than 'Ride Along'.The two stars work so well together, with ultra-short Hart's hyper-energy toned down a little and ultra-tall Ferrell playing a meek, polite man-child. It's not too crass, but there is a bit of swearing as Ferrell tries to learn 'smack talk', which is hilarious. Also - too much of his butt, but that's why it's funny I guess! It's at least counter-balanced by Brie (Annie from 'Community') looking great in a corset.Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments as the 30-day countdown until his imprisonment proceeds, with some nice play on stereotypes throughout. A decent support cast - needed more Ron Funches! - not too long and just ridiculous enough to not get too stupid. Not the best comedy you'll ever see, but far from the worst.",Get Hard

Go see it if you have an unlimited card and an afternoon to spare or save your money for something funnier with a bit more substance.Not in any way racist or abusive it ambles along in it's own quirky way but sometimes drifts away from us with silly sets and unbelievable plot holes. Warner Brothers are just cashing in with this WF vehicle and don't usually put their money into a plot hungry and slightly juvenile piece.

74,troyputland,Get Soft,4,14 April 2015,"Get Hard is ridiculous and absurd in every sense. Clichés and stereotypes consume this comedy, relying on class, light racism and dick jokes just to squander a feeble laugh. Will Ferell's James King, a stock-broker at a finance company is the 'upper-class white man', wrongly accused of fraud. He seeks the help of Darnell (Kevin Hart), the 'lower-class black man' who owns the car washing company at the bottom of the same building. Believing Darnell to have served some jail time in his life, James asks Darnell to teach him how to 'get hard', so he can handle himself in prison. See where this is going already? Their backgrounds open up a film's worth of cannon fodder, purposefully setting us up to pity those who don't deserve to be. Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell's background and class differences aren't taken advantage of. Darnell asks James to start a fight in the park, but when he fails to prove his muscle, he resorts to other, cringe-worthy means. The script doesn't live up to the talents of both actors, they struggle to click unlike Ferrell and Wahlberg in The Other Guys, or Hart and Gad in The Wedding Ringer. The laughs rely heavily on what's said. Ferrell has gotten rusty with his style of humour and Hart puts the performance in but a poor script holds him back.Check out my other reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk",Get Hard
75,ghost_dog86,"Kevin Hart is nothing more than this generation's Chris Tucker, but",7,7 April 2015,"Stop me if you've heard this one before: A rich white man, oblivious to anything pertaining to African American culture, must team up with a financially struggling black man andcomedy ensues. Well not only is that the premise of the majority of 70's and 80's comedies, it's also the premise of ""Get Hard"", the newest film starring Will Ferrell; this time teamed up with Kevin Hart.Now this is going to be a film which the vast majority of critics will not look upon favorably solely based on the fact that it's a comedy which premiered in March. And while this isn't the funniest thing in the Ferrell filmography, it is undeniable that Hart and Ferrell make a superb duo, even if the ""rich white guy, poor black guy"" comedy trope has been done to death. Complementing each other like (no lie) Gibson and Glover, there are a plethora of moments when, despite the early negative critical response, had me wildly surprised with the level of comedy (no matter how tangential and sophomoric) ""Get Hard"" operated at.That said the film does begin to fall apart during the third act when the story leans a bit more towards the dramatic. As this happens the plot (or lack thereof) stands completely naked; essentially exposing the below average direction from Etan Cohen, as well as the simple fact that without the snappy chemistry from the two leads, ""Get Hard"" would've been virtually unwatchable.Final Thought: Highlighted by more than enough moments of high caliber comedic banter, ""Get Hard"" will never achieve the level of memorable ""comedy classic"" since the story itself seems rehashed, even though ""Get Hard"" is funnier than ""Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby"" and leaps and bounds above ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (a movie hipsters and journalists alike incessantly quote and foolishly claim to be the funniest movie ever made).",Get Hard

They play the same roles they typically do, with Hart being a pint-sized black man with a lot of bark and little bite and Ferrell being the big, lumbering air head who's innocence and ignorance somehow make him endearing and obnoxious at the same time. However, those roles blend together perfectly in this movie as the two have great on-screen chemistry. The supporting cast is also fantastic and this movie is, overall, a really good comedy that most people will likely enjoy.",Get Hard

79,CleveMan66,"""Get Hard"" works well as comedy and satire, but overplays jokes and could be seen as offensive.",6,26 March 2015,"After thinking for a while about which movie to go out and see first during the last weekend of March 2015, I decided I was going to ""Get Hard"" (R, 1:40). It's an awkwardly-titled movie with a double entendre that could get you in some trouble (or be pretty funny, depending on your point of view). Madonna once put out a book of explicit photos, simply titled ""Sex"". I remember asking a book store employee if she had Sex. She was not amused. Well, I'm more mature now (a little), so I was wondering how best to request a ticket for this movie. When it was my turn at the box office window, I simply said ""Get Hard"". The girl on the other side of the glass was unfazed. ""At 7 o'clock?"" she asked me. I let that one go. Then, as I walked into the theater, I was wondering, if this movie is any good (and/or makes a decent profit), what would they call the sequel? ""Get Hard 2""? ""2 Get Hard""? ""Get 2 Hard""? There are no easy answers.Sorry. Couldn't resist. Okay. Now that I got that out of my system, I think I'll actually review a movie Will Ferrell is James King, a wealthy and talented stock broker who is very full of himself and, except for his particular area of expertise, is completely out of touch with the world around him. He's Ron Burgundy, if his leather-bound books were a leather office chair instead. Or Ricky Bobby, if he knew more about stocks than stock cars. But James is smarter than those other two characters he has played in the past. Well, a little smarter. Darnell Lewis is pretty smart too, just not as successful. Kevin Hart plays the owner of a small car detailing business which caters to the rich and infamous, including Mr. James King. Darnell is working hard so he can afford to move his wife (Edwina Findley) and young daughter (Ariana Neal) to a better neighborhood – and his daughter to a safer school. But he's not sure how soon he'll be able to make that happen. He is, as he admits to his wife, desperate. That is, until James makes him an offer he can't refuse.James is going to prison. On the evening of his engagement party, right in front of his fiancé, Alissa (Alison Brie), and his boss (and future father-in-law), Martin (Craig T. Nelson), he's arrested for financial fraud. He protests his innocence, but is found guilty. In the eyes of the public, he's a Bernie Madoff type of swindler and the judge throws the book at him. 10 years. In the maximum security prison at San Quentin. Martin tells James his investigators will find out what really happened, but James knows that if they don't, he'll be headed up the river in 30 days. James is scared and on the verge of a nervous breakdown. When he next crosses paths with Darnell and blurts out his fears, James offers to pay Darnell 30-large to teach him how to survive in prison. Darnell has never even had so much as a parking ticket, but James assumes Darnell is an ex-con. Because, you know, Darnell is black. And he ""only"" washes cars for a living. And one in three black men spends time in prison at some point. James just did the math. In his mind, 1+1+1 = thug.Darnell needs the money, so he lets James hold on to his stereotypes and his assumptions and sets out to give James his $30,000-worth. Alissa has since dumped James (natch), so Darnell uses James' big house to help prepare James for THE Big House. James' tennis court becomes a prison yard and his wine cellar becomes a prison cell. Darnell makes James work out, treats him like a convict and even stages a mock prison riot, all with the help of James' household staff, who seem to enjoy putting him through the wringer. James' fragile emotional state and lack of street smarts (or even common sense) forces Darnell to keep changing tactics, even taking James to see Darnell's cousin, Russell (rapper, producer and actor T.I.), who actually has done time, and is currently the leader of a neighborhood street gang. Through it all, James is comically game for all of Darnell's ideas and gives them all his best shot, while still claiming to have been wrongfully convicted. Eventually, Darnell starts to wonder if James really is innocent.""Get Hard"" functions well as both comedy and satire, but has a tendency to overplay jokes and portray situations in a way that some may find offensive. The film shines a light on racial and sexual stereotypes, but whether the results are funny or upsetting depends on your sense of humor. Same with the constant prison rape jokes. Whether you're up for those kinds of humor or not, there are plenty of other moments that should elicit a chuckle or two. I especially liked the recurring gag of James trying to toughen up by awkwardly picking fights with random large men in a local park. Ferrell's well-practiced talent for playing the well-meaning, but self-absorbed and out-of-touch knucklehead sells the story and most of the humor. Hart does his part pretty well, showing continued improvement in his acting, but still resorting to mugging a little too often. Speaking of the story, the sub-plot of whether or not James is really guilty makes for a nice narrative on which to hang the jokes, although the characters in that subplot often do things that don't make sense. But, hey, it's a comedy. And a Will Ferrell / Kevin Hart comedy at that. It's a bit of a good news and bad news scenario. I better just go ahead and give this movie my grade – ""B"". I don't want to overthink it. I don't need writing this review to Get Harder. Wait! That's it!!",Get Hard

83,stephendaxter,Funny moments but disappointing from this comedy duo,5,10 June 2015,"Get Hard is a comedy starring two of the funniest actors out there today, and having this duo of Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell you would think would make for an extremely funny movie, unfortunately it doesn't but it still had its fair share of good laughs. They had pretty good chemistry and most if not all of the good funny moments came from the interactions between the two of them. They played off the racial stereotypes for pretty much the entire film and as the film went on it got less funny and repetitive. The good moments of the film in terms of the comedy came in the middle of the film, thats where you have everyone introduced and the build up is over but you are also not yet exhausted by the repetitive jokes. In terms of their performances, there is nothing new here, it feels like they were both playing similar characters that they have played many times before in their previous films. But the characters did fit very well into the plot. The plot of the film was a little predictable, but at the same time i wasn't bored of following the plot. It didn't feel like certain plot points happened in order to get a few quick jokes in, everything flowed pretty well and i was still interested in seeing what was going to happen next. There is not much else i can say about this film, there is nothing new to see here from Will or Kevin, but the film does provide with some good jokes and an interesting plot that can get you through the film fairly entertained. So i guess if you are a fan of either member of this comedy duo then you will enjoy seeing them together in this film. - 5/10",Get Hard

I really enjoyed all the movies he made up to a certain point... For the past 2-3 years he comes back with one failure after the other. Although the concepts of the movies are pretty fair, somehow they come out to be really poor in terms of jokes and general sense of humor. This movie is no exception. It lacks a sense of humor and it goes for the easy laugh every time. With the same lines that Ferrel has done the past 3-4 years, over and over again, offering nothing new. I would rate it with 4 out of 10 but I did laugh in the end a bit, although I think these laughs were pretty much pulled out of me rather than anything else.

87,MUFCOK,Big let down.,5,6 July 2015,"On paper, Get Hard would be a perfect film for me as it stars Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart, who I find very funny. However it appeared that from the trailers that this film would not be side splitting, they seemed to put 80% of the gags in the trailer and it still appeared forced and not too amusing.Will Ferrell is a multi-millionaire, who lives with his super-model girlfriend and on his engagement party he is arrested for fraud and informed that he will have 30 days to get his affairs in order before he is sent to prison. Kevin Hart washes cars in the basement of Will Ferrell's office block; this is where Will Ferrell tells him of his recent conviction and asks how Kevin Hart survived prison, with this assumption being made merely because he is black! Ferrell offers to pay Hart cash if he trains him and prepares him for prison over the 30 days of freedom that he has left. Hart, desperate for money in order to send his daughter to a better school, accepts Ferrell's offer even though he has never committed a crime in his entire life, never mind undergo a prison sentence!Now I am not going to judge this film over the political correctness of it as modern day PC is on its backside, everyone seems offended by something these days and the internet and social media in particular are platforms for these things to escalate out of control. However this story does push the boundaries, it didn't offend me but It was obviously going to get under some peoples skin. A rich white man, goes to a poor black man and assumes he is a criminal who has been to prison and assumes he knows how to look after himself inside.Seeing Kevin Hart act tough and bully Will Ferrell is amusing at first and Hart does a great job of this, however this seems to be the only scenario, with very little variation. Sadly I felt it ran out of steam as the film progressed. The two contrasting stereotypes that they both played were funny and well done but the film needed much more than that to keep you hooked. Kevin Hart had his usual highly energetic approach which contrasted Will Ferrell very well. There are some scenes which made me laugh out loud but for me there were not nearly enough of them. Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell are both very funny actors in my opinion but this movie was seriously let down, not by the lead actors but by the direction and script. Ferrell and Hart didn't have much to play with, scenarios felt limiting and the jokes felt repeated and by the end of the movie I was feeling more than a little bored. It is one massive cliché with plot holes with some questionable moments.Overall, A film with Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart should have been much better than this, it will more than likely go down as a flop and I doubt it will be remembered for years to come. You must know what this film is about before viewing so if you know this is something that will offend you then why bother watching it? Just leave it alone!5/10",Get Hard

89,rjsf96,Semi-Hard,6,22 October 2015,"Before viewing 'Get Hard' I was optimistic whilst at the same time feeling nervous, worried and scared. I had good reason. Comedies have not been reliable as of late. It is with relief then that I can report that 'Get Hard' is funny, although not without a great many problems.James King is a millionaire and has a dumb, beautiful wife that is clearly out of his league. King is framed for a crime he did not commit and the judge sentences him to time in a maximum security prison where he will go there within thirty days. He enlists the help of Darnell Lewis whom will help King overcome the horrors of prison for a small fee.The best thing about 'Get Hard' and what it consistently uses to its advantage is the chemistry that Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart display. They bounce between each other and exude confidence on screen. If you cannot get enough of silly albeit crude comedies, then 'Get Hard' may just be the film for you. I understand that Kevin Hart will not be an actor that everyone will find hilarious, but for those of us that do, you can sleep easy knowing that he brings his A game to the mayhem that ensues. Ferrell as King is likable enough although not as well utilised in 'Get Hard' as he was in 'Anchorman', he still has charm to offer.The thing with comedies nowadays is that the majority of them are racist. Some people may believe without thinking that 'Get Hard' is, although I beg to differ. Hart's character wants King to be racist to fit in with other people at prison. King says no, but eventually agrees. I never felt that 'Get Hard' was racist; your mileage may vary as to how sensitive you are. If you are unsure steer clear.'Get Hard' in my mind never drags. I understand that comedy is more subjective than any other genre of film. So let's just say I love Edgar Wright comedies and despise most Adam Sandler films. That should give you an idea as to what I consider funny. 'Get Hard' is admittedly not as uproariously hilarious as '22 Jump Street' and lacks the subversiveness of the Cornetto trilogy. The annoying thing about 'Get Hard' is that most of its problems could have been fixed. King's wife is never less than obnoxious; it is no shock that she is a gold digger. The twist at the climax of the film completely kills the mood. You can see it coming a mile off so it's no surprise to anyone. 'Get Hard' is not a thriller, so it's ever so odd that in the last few minutes it tries so hard to be. Now this is where things get confusing. 'Get Hard' is never outright homophobic. But it is best to say that some of the ideas behind certain scenes are questionable at best. When you make a joke about a guy almost giving head you know you have stepped over the line.'Get Hard' is not a flawless comedy or even a great one, its merely serviceable. It's a shame as if it had aimed higher it could have pulled off grander, better and more tasteful jokes. I was however laughing almost non-stop, even if I was ashamed of myself for doing so. If that is any indication of its quality then you might want to give 'Get Hard' the benefit of the doubt. Just don't expect the wit of the Jump Street movies or the sophistication of an Edgar Wright comedy.",Get Hard
90,vistheindian,Expected but fun,7,10 May 2015,"Quickie Review:James King (Will Ferrell) is sentenced guilty for white collar crimes. Completely naïve to the world outside his mansion, he hires Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) to train and prepare him for the life behind bars. Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart have a very good comedic chemistry. The two personalities make the best of a predictable movie, and they are the reason why this movies works. More often than not it's a really funny movie but when jokes falls flat, it misses by a large margin. All in all, Get Hard is an enjoyable comedy simply because of the cast.Full Review:I love lot of Will Ferrell's movies, and I really enjoy Kevin Hart's stand up. So seeing this duo in a feature film should get me excited, but I wasn't. Mainly because I feared this movie would just be a collection of scenes that feel like skits. While that is somewhat the actual result, as a whole the movie was funny and hence I ended up having a pretty good time.If you have seen any of Will Ferrell's previous movies, you know exactly the type of character he is playing. Once again he is a bumbling idiot oblivious to, and out of touch with society norms. You would think that'd be a tiring gimmick, and you would be right if this was a solo Ferrell starring movie. Thankfully Get Hard still feels comedically fresh because of the addition of Kevin Hart. The best parts of the movie are the scenes dedicated to the two leads. They improvise a lot of these scenes off of their comedic strengths. Ferrell is great at delivering jokes that are borderline offensive but still likable because it doesn't fully cross that line. Meanwhile Hart is excellent with the physical comedy with his more animated body language. Special mention to T.I. who has a small role in the movie but steals the few scenes he is in.Although I enjoyed majority of the improvisation, it may also be the movie's biggest weakness. There are moments where a particular joke starts off well, but goes on for far too long. It starts to feel a little desperate, and if it isn't a good joke to begin with, it becomes progressively worse. Luckily this doesn't happen too frequently but it is noticeable. Additionally this movie is very predictable. I knew the exact beats of the story to expect within the first 15mins of the movie. So there is nothing surprising story wise, it follows the clichéd formula of comedies.Despite the formulaic story and few overstretched jokes, Get Hard was pleasantly enjoyable. It delivers on consistent laughs, nothing gut busting but still satisfying. If you are a fan of Will Ferrell or Kevin Hart this is definitely a must-watch. On the other hand if you're just a casual viewer looking for some laughs and a good time, I'd still recommend giving Get Hard a try (at least when released on VOD).Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Get Hard

And once you get over it, and just immerse yourself in the ridiculous-less that happens when Will Farrell and Kevin Hart get together, it is just pure fun and laughs the whole way through. ""Get Hard"" is about a stereotypical well educated, over-privileged middle aged white man, James King, and his friendship with Darnell, a well-to-do blue collar black guy trying to save enough money to get a new house so his daughter can go to a better school. James King is accused of fraud and sentenced to 10 years in San Quentin, a hardcore maximum security prison. Fearing what will happen to him in prison, King has one month to ""Get Hard"" so that he will be able to survive his 10 year sentence.What follow is absolutely hilarious.

The film is full of flat underdeveloped characters, that you never feel for, and the plot which had some potential falls flat, partially due to sporadic pacing. The film is driven by homophobia, and some misconceptions, but that seems like a necessary evil in this instance as a majority of people share these misconceptions, so they are an effective way to reach mainstream audiences. That being said the film has it's moments that are funny, and if you shut your brain off you can enjoy yourself, and Ferrell and Hart have great chemistry.",Get Hard
95,keithlovesmovies,Get Hard Review,5,23 September 2015,"When a crazy-rich hedge-fund manager James King (Will Ferrell) is convicted of fraud and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Realizing that he won't survive for very long in prison, he uses the month in which he has to get his affairs in order and turns to black businessman Darnell (Kevin Hart) for help. What James doesn't know is that Darnell is a law-abiding citizen who has never been to prison and he decides to use this fact in order to take advantage of James to get money for his family so they can have a better life. As Darnell begins training James, they both start to see that they may have been wrong about many things, including each other.Just like Mortdecai, I have been avoiding this up until now due to its reputation of being bad. Surprisingly enough, it is a better film. I will say that the story isn't that original and also a little predictable but it did keep me engaged. I also found this film a lot funnier than I expected. Most of the comedy from this film comes from offending several races, sexual orientations, and social statuses. In other words, it comes from interactions with one another and how each perceive one another. They demonstrate this through the use of stereotypes and caricatures and they take advantage of their 18A/R rating. I was also very disappointed because of this since I found the writing to be very lazy since it relied solely on what I mentioned previously. Although I get rarely offended by things, it is easy to see how one would be offended by this. I wasn't offended but I also did not find most of it funny at all. The parts that I found funny are the moments where Will Ferrell was being almost every other character he has done before and Kevin Hart was being almost every other character he has done before. I am not proud of this but I will admit to having laughed a few times. This goes back to the lazy writing and the performances of Ferrell and Hart. They were okay and they had good chemistry but I felt that they could have tried a little harder and gave us something more. I felt the story started off slow and got decent near the end after it stopped being offensive. I wish the subplot which led to that could have been explored a lot earlier. I also liked Alison Brie as James's girlfriend Alissa but I wish we could have seen more of her. Overall I thought this movie was okay but I was a little disappointed because it could have been more based on the comedic talents of the starts but those were wasted by the material and the direction.Score: 5.5/10 keithlovesmovies.com",Get Hard
96,kieranbattams,What you'd expect...,6,29 March 2015,"I love Will Ferrell in my opinion he is the funniest actor working today, I even liked Semi-Pro and feel it is severely underrated. When i heard he was doing a film with Kevin Hart i thought it was a genius idea. The trailers had me laughing.. the premise seemed funny.. until i found out what it really was. That being said this film is extremely racist in parts and the rape jokes really are too much, there comes a time when the line needs to be drawn. Although despite this there are some real laugh out loud moments and both Ferrell and Hart do a great job with their delivery in both physical and dialogue based comedy. When the jokes hit they really do hit.. but some jokes just feel kind of awkward.I wont go into too much detail because most of you probably already know the premise. Will Ferrell plays a racist stockbroker who assumes that because of the colour of his skin Kevin Hart's character has been to jail and he asks for his help to survive in prison so he doesn't get sexually assaulted.. and yes this is honestly the plot. I expected the film to have a fair amount of rape jokes but there really is a time in the film where i got tired of this and it gets a little uncomfortable. One of the more uncomfortable moments has Will Ferrell attempting to perform oral on a gay character.. to me it just went on way too long. That's not to say there is no good moments. The first half of this movie was actually really enjoyable for the most part. Seeing Kevin Hart train Will Ferrell in his own home was great and the set design was actually great. One scene in the film where Ferrell attempts to pick a fight in the park with some much bigger men had me laughing out loud for a while.A big problem with the film is that it completely changes course in the last act. The training scenes were fun to watch but then Ferrell and Hart enlist new people (Hart's cousin played by TI) to help him out and the film got slow and started to fall apart before we are treated to a predictable ending. The two comedians are on top form with what they are given and Get Hard isn't a bad way to spend 90 minutes, I didn't hate the film at all but I hope these two work together again some time in a movie that will have a bit more potential to be funnier. I felt we could have been given more but it is what you would expect.. plus the prison riot really was a well-shot and funny scene, more scenes like it would have been great but this film isn't terrible so there's that.",Get Hard
97,fluturoj,Amusing,6,3 August 2016,"This was a typical Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart since both they characters are what you usually would expect from both of them. I found that sometimes there was unnecessary use of racist jokes but sometimes the whole idea of the movie was based on those prejudices and stereotypical jokes. The movie had a good plot and story line. The only thing that I found a bit off putting was how easy they recognised that Martin was the bad guy and how easy they won the confrontation with him. However, since the whole idea was the relationship between Darnell and James, I think its a good idea that they did not focus on the fight with the villain and as much as they did in preparing James for prison. So well done on that front. Real-life lessons: Not much reflection about real-life can be done after this movie but this is quite understandable since the movie never aimed that in the fist place. Maybe the only thing is to realise how sometimes people are so narrow minded and actually do create beliefs about a person based on stereotypes. This movie is a good reminder why we should not do that. Character analysis: James and Darnell are both well developed characters and very well brought to life by Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell.",Get Hard

101,prospectus_capricornium,Offensive and Insensitive Comedy,4,29 April 2015,"Neither a pair of bankable actors nor an intereting premise is enough to redeem 'GET HARD' from the mess it created for itself. It's a movie that mostly tries to entertain, but ends up, nonetheless, bringing the audience to scratching their heads and arching their brows.The real problem here is not how it lacks enough good anecdotes to throw—because in fact it has a lot—it's the seemingly endless fling of jokes that usually undermine their subjects, that makes riding along its comic efforts, exceedingly unbearable. It's amusing and annoying at the same time how confidently it rolls its avalance of homophobic and anti-black remarks and still seemingly bounce back to its form to push for more. Get Hard deliberately mines these stereotypes in hopes to deliver something that can generate bursts of brittle laughter, but the result isn't even worth a chuckle.Will Ferell isn't in his perfect element here. I don't think I have seen him as often enough to make a proper assessment, but here he's not even close to a character worth caring about. The same can be said with Kevin Hart. Their initial drama summons affection for their characters. Both are tangled up with their respective misfortunes and troubles, which creates a poignant connection between them that is worth paying attention to. And while that doesn't eliminate its flaws, such poignancy sheds light to the tiny portion of the narrative that is better than the rest the script's own garbage—a part not bereft of insensitivity. Still, the entire output doesn't bear even the littlest of semblance to something deserving of audience's affection.It will be difficult to take GET HARD's intentions as merely attempts toh deliver fun and entertainment, as almost everything it presents take offensive forms. There's an overwhelming potential to create something that can be of more sense, but that's simply put into waste and never utilized for a better, tangible result. GET HARD lives up to its title by being as much insensitive as a racist heart could be, hence, it's waste of time. 4/10",Get Hard

And I'm sorry but in my opinion movies like Ride along, About Last night and Think like a man too just weren't as funny to me as The Wedding Ringer and Get Hard. Is it just me or is Kevin Hart better opposite white dudes? So Will Ferrell's character James gets caught up in a typical white collar crime and is soon to do jail time. Kevin Hart's character Darnell is in the process of trying to start his own business but is stuck being valet at James' office building. Naturally one night James vents to Darnell and the idea presents itself that Kevin should train him and make him ""hard"" for prison life. The problem is Darnell has never been to prison.He enlists the help of his cousin played by T.I to help him understand prison life and when training James seems impossible Darnell goes through his cousin's gang to try and get him protection on the inside. That is until Darnell realizes there's no way James could've committed the crime in the first place since he's so clueless. The two then come together to try and find out who actually did.There's a brief summary for you but the chemistry between Will and Kevin was very hilariously reminiscent of the chemistry between Tim Robbins and Martin Laurence in Nothing to Lose.

120,jerrywright15,Kev Hart and Will Ferrell are Comedic Gold,7,28 March 2015,"I am a huge fan of both of these actors and the things they are able to accomplish on the big screen. You've got the funny, slightly weird, everyman, Will Ferrell who constantly brings audiences to tears with his comedic work in movies like Anchorman, Talladega Nights, Step Brothers...etc. Then you have the rising box office movie star, stand up genius, one of the funniest guys in this GALAXY Kevin Hart who shines in buddy movies like Ride Along, About Last Night, The Wedding Ringer, Think Like A Man..so on. The pairing of these two actors on the big screen was a match made in the comedic heavens. It has been quite awhile since I have been able to sit in a theater and do nothing but laugh for a movies 100 min run time. From beginning to bittersweet end you will never find a period longer then a very few minutes where you just won't find something to laugh at. Although the way these two actors bring comedy to life may be slightly different, the play off each other exceptionally well in this movie as if they've been working together for years. Not to mention you get TWO very physical comedic actors who are not afraid to push subjects and themselves for pure entertainment. In my opinion this movie is far superior to Wedding Ringer or Ride Along, so if you enjoyed those, you'll love this. My only complaints for this would be that for a rated R picture, this was still very tame in terms of what these two ""could"" have brought to the table. The only thing that really seems to make this an R comedy is the mild language that really isn't that harsh and a large amount of the word ""dick"" and the actual showing of a penis. Other then that its your run of the mill comedy that brings me back to the days of an early Adam Sandler or Jim Carrey movie; with the laughs that just won't stop. I'd recommend keeping small children at home but other then that it really is a movie guaranteed to make the harshest of hearts smile. Hopefully from this we will start to see Kevin Hart take over as complete lead of a movie and put his acting to the ultimate test. As for Will Ferrell..well what can you say about a guy who pretty much conquers every single role he is offered, except for, I hope to see him in countless more roles. On a side note, for you rap fans out there. T.I. makes a substantial cameo in this movie and you can tell he still knows how to hold a screen from his ATL days.",Get Hard

This movie had my laughing from literally the first few seconds and the humour didn't let up till the end, in fact the plot became more and more ridiculous and hilarious as the movie progressed. The first movie in ages where the audience, myself included, were really laughing out loud while with our hands over our mouths in shock at some of the dialogue.Fantastic acting and some really fun memorable characters not only saved the otherwise predictable plot but made it a joy to sit through. Even though you kind of know what to expect next, the executions of each scene are so well carried out and fun that you really don't care and don't have a moment to be bored.

And as we learn at the end of the movie: this is also perfectly fine if it happens to the bad guys. It's so fine we can all have a good laugh about it.In a time of the false Rolling Stone mass rape story, in a time where rape culture is seen everywhere except when it happen to men, in a time where we have countless ""survivors of rape"" in a ""rape culture"", in a time where ""Hunting Ground"" was made....in this time it is perfectly fine to make a comedy that circles around only one thing: that it is normal and really funny to get raped as a man in a US prison.Definite, there is a rape culture in many countries. It is about how normal it is that males get raped in prison and how the bad guys earn to get raped. It's so normal that our society can make a nice comedy of that situation.Now, if you think I am exaggerating: try to imagine a comedy where a female is threatened to get raped every day for the next 10 years.

Some may not agree but, I call it like I see it. The previews make the plot simple. Rich Guy asks underling stereo typical Black Guy to teach him how to survive prison. The film then goes on a standard set of set ups leading towards the ultimate goal. There are a few laughs. I have been a little thrown off by all the ""Penis"" shots in movies as of recent. During a scene in the film, a situation occurs were a penis is shown more than once. Yeah....hilarious. To say this is the film I expected to see....I'd be lying. It wasn't bad! It was hilarious either. It was what I like to call a cookie cutter film. The previews show a lot of Clifford ""T.I."" Harris indicating there is a major role for him in the film. T.I. is in the film maybe 10-15 minutes.....towards the end of the movie. Punchlines aren't always bulls eyes. Some of the jokes seem last minute and fall short. Kevin does a decent job in his role. Will was OK. The problem to me leads to a question I have to ask...... Have Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell played their respective comedy cards too many times? I'll leave that to you to decide. Should you pay to see this in the theaters? Probably not. Maybe a matinée price. Would I suggest waiting the 3 months for the BluRay or digital release?....Yes. The film isn't bad but, isn't worthy of the steep price one pays to view in the first run houses.

Etan Cohen directed this trash and also co-wrote it with some equally depraved individuals who reveal a fixation on male anatomy and prison rape.Pop singer John Mayer appeared in this filth and actually sang a crass ""song"" on the Late Show with Jimmy Fallon, who was uncredited, but that did not help either one of them. The movie opened with Ferrell's butt shot and despite a couple of mildly funny scenes, never rose above its profane and ugly self loathing demeanor. Stereotypes are everywhere but the ridicule and disdain of white people took priority. Towards the end of the movie Ferrell's character actually ""joined"" a black drug dealer's gang to gain ""protection"" prior to entering prison at San Quentin for trumped up white collar crimes for which he was framed by his future father in law. Ferrell's character tried ""joining"" a white (racist) biker gang but was assaulted because he couldn't say the ""N"" word.Throw in a disgusting scene where Ferrell's attempting to give oral sex to a guy in a bathroom stall and on that alone you have enough to make you vomit and/or stop watching this waste of money and time.Director Cohen ought to stop ""making"" movies because if this is his idea of comedy, he is one sick fixated piece of work.

Enjoyed all of his movies especially The Wedding Ringer. Watching the trailer for the first time, I was insanely excited to see Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart working together! Finally I got a Saturday night show tickets to watch it and the movie was rather unique within its story in the beginning. Will Ferrell did what he does best with his over the top comic role of a millionaire, smart but naive character. Kevin Hart also did what he does best as a broke, vulnerable but funny confident character. Soon you find out that you have seen this before in buddy cop movies. Two very different personalities (status and attitude) get together to accomplish a goal and become best friends. It is a clichéd story which didn't live up to my expectations but they did have humorous scenes which got me laughing and isn't that the whole point?

There's something overly fictional about Will Ferrell (James) being sent to San Quentin for 10 years over some fraud money issues. The comical stereotype of Kevin Hart (Darnell) being black so he can help (James) ""Get Hard"" and prepared for prison is the main subject of this movie here. I am a huge Kevin Hart fan and him with Will Ferrell teamed up together seems completely genius for this well it wasn't. Will Ferell played your typical white guy who's scared of African Americans and just tried to hard in this movie. The fact he was scared of Darnell when Darnell just walked to his window was beyond dumb. I love dumb comedy, but this was just dumb.

His car washer, Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) is married to his wife, Rita and is trying to put their daughter Makayla in a better school away from the bad neighbourhood they live in. James meets Darnell when the latter accidentally frightens James in the parking lot because he assumed Darnell was going to rob him, when he just wanted to give him his keys. James makes a speech about how he got to his success, and to inspire Darnell to go for his. He pulls out a big wad of cash, only to pull out two singles as a ""tip"" for Darnell.Alissa hosts an engagement party for herself and James. She gives him an electric guitar as a gift, and she invites John Mayer up on stage to perform. James performs alongside Mayer momentarily until the cops storm in and arrest James for fraud and embezzlement. James's lawyer Peter Penny urges James to go for a guilty plea, but he refuses and insists that he will be exonerated. Instead, everybody that lost money in the embezzlement scheme is out for James's head. The judge finds him guilty and sentences James to ten years at San Quentin, with only 30 days to get his affairs in order. His assets are frozen and he is placed under house arrest. He cuts off the ankle bracelet and tries to flee the country. He drives to a country club to get Alissa to go with him, but she says she has left him and decided to move on. The police then show up and arrest James, who asks his boss and Alissa's father Martin (Craig T. Nelson) for help.Darnell encounters James once more in the parking lot, expressing his fears over going to prison. He asks Darnell how he managed in prison, simply assuming he was incarcerated because he is black. James then begs Darnell to teach him how to toughen up if he wants to survive in prison. Darnell demands payment in the form of $30,000, which James agrees to.Darnell, who has little idea of how to act tough himself, tries to put on a facade of his own to convince James that he can show him how to prepare himself. To start his ""training"", Darnell pepper-sprays James upon arriving to his home. He tries to get James ready for prison by intimidating with his ""mad dog"" face (James can only ""sad dog"" it), creating scenarios in which he must defend himself, and picking fights at the park (only for James to be beaten multiple times). James gets in touch with Martin and says he's getting help. Martin, who is the actual crook, thinks James is onto him and orders Peter and a hired gun named Gayle to take care of business.With little time left and even less improvement, Darnell figures that James has to learn how to perform oral sex in prison. They go to a gay hook-up spot for James to find a man to give a blow job to, but can't go through with it and tells Darnell (in front of the other curious and interested gay men) that he will keep going and do whatever it takes to ""get hard."" James starts to work out harder and faster, makes shivs, and learns ""keistering"" - smuggling contraband in the anus. Darnell simulates a prison raid with the help from James' personal workers acting as inmates. In the chaos, James gets a shiv stuck in his head. Darnell drives James to his home for Rita to get the shiv out. He has dinner and listens to Darnell make up a story of how he went to prison (which is just a retelling of Boyz N The Hood). Rita asks Darnell why he can't just find the real criminal to help James.Mere days before his incarceration, James and Darnell resolve for James to join a local gang, the Crenshaw Kings, to protect him in prison. James dresses in a ridiculous outfit that gets unwanted attention. Darnell's cousin Russell (T.I.) runs the gang and isn't convinced that James can pay him and knows that Darnell is lying about prison. James does help the gang gain interest in finance and stocks. Darnell drives James to a bar where the Allegiance of Whites gang is. James is unable to be a convincing racist, leading the white supremacists to think he's a cop. They nearly burn his face with a motorcycle tire until Darnell rescues him by bursting in with a flamethrower. Darnell realises James is innocent and they conclude that Martin is the crook. They sneak into his home and find the embezzlement records on Martin's old computer. Unfortunately, Gayle finds them and takes the computer back after telling James that Darnell has a clean record and never actually went to prison. Despite his earlier misjudgement of Darnell previously being in prison, James feels betrayed and leaves the parking lot.James returns to the Crenshaw Kings with the intention of joining. For his initiation, they want him to kill someone. Darnell arrives in time to stop him and convince him to catch Martin and expose him. The two find Martin's yacht and sneak on board. They grab the computer, only to come across Gayle and more hit men.Several funny and adventurous incidents happen then till the end.I absolutely enjoyed watching this great,funny and adventurous movie.""Get Hard"" is a must see movie for all adults and teens.",Get Hard

143,princemilo,Get Hard is a rock solid blue comedy,9,25 March 2015,"If you're offended by pasty white asses, full frontal male nudity and ridiculous vulgarity, do not bother with Get Hard, the funniest film I've seen in a while. This film declares its intent in the title and its opening frame, right after James King (played to perfection in a vehicle designed for Will Ferrell) cries his eyes out – more about that in a moment. Will Ferrell is a divisive figure. There are people who find him hysterical (I am unabashedly in that camp) and those who just don't see what's so funny. Again, if you're in the latter camp, don't try this film to figure it out. It's unapologetic Will being Will from reel to reel. Life is perfect for white man James King. He's a one percenter and about to become elite amongst even that slim group with his latest promotion to partner in his soon to be father in law's (Craig T. Nelson) investment firm. His fiancée, Alissa (Alison Brie) declares that he needs to have everything, including her body in every white way possible. He has no idea of the meaning of the silver spoon lodged in his mouth, espousing ridiculous platitudes about the value of hard work in front of all of those ""beneath"" him.On the flip side is Darnell (Kevin Hart). He's short, black and broke. He has a lovely wife and an adorable young daughter, who unfortunately goes to a very dangerous elementary school in South Central L.A. because Darnell can't afford the down payment on a house in a better area. It is this heart that makes Darnell immediately likable and grounds James' antics. Darnell owns a mobile car wash for executives inside of James' building. His need of James' money is obvious – and hilariously rebuffed. When things quickly go south for James and he needs something from Darnell, the backlash is equally hilarious. The odd couple setup is obvious and extremely well played, proving, once again, it's more important to execute than try too hard to be original. And, for the record, I'm also in the camp that everything is derivative (see ""everything's a remix"" for more), so when it comes to where to place one's effort, it should be in For a moment, I saw shades of an excellent comedy from about thirty years ago, Trading Places. Get Hard goes an entirely different direction and it's not nearly in the same class as Trading Place. But for front line, punch you in the face, over-the-top comedy Get Hard delivers the goods. There are few taboos the film won't touch – racism, homophobia, class-ism to name a few. Comedy has the ability to skewer, shed light upon and potentially even heal some of these ills. No, I'm not saying this film is on par with Dr. King's ""I have a dream"" speech, but, for the type of comedy it is, I was impressed by how well it plays the white/black divide angle with more nuance, intrigue and, dare I say it, poignancy than I've seen in a while. Homophobia gets a strong and positive tweaking, too, in Darnell's developing friendship with a gay man after a howlingly funny training scene at a local gay hot spot. For how homosexuality is often viewed in large parts of the popular black culture, it was a big deal to see Darnell having a legitimate, caring friendship on the screen. But enough attempts at convincing. It's a silly, low-brow, rude comedy by design. To complain about it for being such is like being mad at crocodile for biting. They don't hide their teeth – and neither does Get Hard.",Get Hard

It does have funny stupid humor, but there is also an unexpected vulnerability in the two main characters.Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart both portray good guys that are in bad situations. Kevin Hart's character, Darnell, has his own business, but bad credit and lack of savings keeps him and his family living in a rough area. Will Ferrell's character, James, has it all--beautiful fiancée, tons of money, lovely house. Sadly, James is framed for embezzlement and is sentenced to 10 years in a maximum security prison. Darnell, for a price, becomes James' tutor for prison life and hilarity ensues.Even more than hilarity, James and Darnell start to genuinely care for each other. Their bromance is one for the books. The two actors have great chemistry and an awesome height difference. I would totally watch another movie with these two, especially if Will Ferrell does Capoeira again.I also give points for originality.

148,harry_averton,Disappointing,4,29 March 2015,"A disappointing entry from director Etan Cohen, and writers Jay Martel and Ian Roberts. The only thing that i took from this film, was the amount of talent that was wasted, due to a poor script and lazy direction. You've got two of the funniest comedians in the world at the moment, in your hands, and you choose to put them in a series of unfunny, cheap and predictable gags, that only manages to get a few grins every now and again. A grin or a smile, is quite uncommon for a Will Ferrel flick, as I'm usually bursting out with laughter, in almost every scene. This wasn't the case for this film. Also, doesn't anybody want to mention Big Stan in their reviews? Get Hard is a complete and utter rip- off of Rob Schneider's Big Stan.",Get Hard
149,rentself,Very smart comedy,10,3 December 2015,"Kudos to Etan Cohen. This is not slap stick comedy, it is a slap in the face comedy. So many meanings and messages are weaved throughout and it will get to people. I was blown away by the cleverness and thoughtfulness. It covers so many topics currently causing ignorance in society. I see it as designed to reach people on a personal level. Whoever you are, you are always doing your best and deserve the best. Stop comparing yourself to others and take care of you. Kevin Hart played a scene I doubt many actors can pull off. I know nothing about Will Ferrell but will go watch his other movies now. I loved it all. True art right where needed.",Get Hard

She declines he gets arrested again. Now, in the real world, his band would be revoked-house arrest cancelled-he would be ordered to begin his sentence, and be facing an escape charge and likely receive 5 more years---instead, we see him arrested by Marshalls then cut to Kevin hart opening will Farrell's trunk in his underground car wash and is surprised to find him curled up in a ball in his own trunk?!--no explanation as to how he got there-why is he still free? And...apparently no longer on house arrest--it's like producers and writers are so confident with the talent, they got lazy and didn't bother to make sure the story makes sense--",Get Hard

154,filipovits,Worst comedy I have seen in a while!!!,1,11 June 2016,Just awful.After seeing the trailer I thought Id give it a go but unfortunately instead of witty humour every now and then what I expected it's just full of over used situation jokes.I expected way more from Will Ferrel and I admit he has made some fairly decent comedies but this one is just a plain disgrace for his career. It is probably just about pleasing the US audience which is apparently getting dumber and dumber.The acting feels amateur a lot of the times and the script is very badly written. Cant say anything positive about it.,Get Hard
155,edsittner,"This is only ""pour le connoisseurs""",10,4 August 2015,"Though Ferrell is acting his classic character, Kevin Hart tremendously plays a hard one. Over and above is Etan Cohen's highly professional directing as well as the movie's extremely smart screenplay and dialogs. This is a blue comedy to be seen by smart and perceptive people, who are able to appreciate and enjoy this kind of movie. Wholeheartedly recommend to watch it.I couldn't believe that this piece of art was only 6.1 rated on IMDb. Therefore I would respectfully ask users who undervalued it to go back to Batman and never try again the real modern cinema. They'll end up disappointed anyway.",Get Hard

This award previously went to Evil Alien Conquerors from 2003.This was a comedy that was not only not funny, but painful to watch!Spoiler Alert: How is it funny that a man is encouraged to perform a sex act with another person when he is clearly not attracted to that person. How is it funny to show graphic genitalia pictures as part of this funny scene while both parties are humiliated? The sad thing is that they had actual opportunities for humor had they chosen to make the characters more likable and not be as graphic. The only likable character was the girl who played Kevin Hart's daughter. If you decide to watch this movie, I suggest a sleep mask and earplugs.",Get Hard

When I first start hearing of Will Ferrell, I didn't like him as an actor but my brother in law kept bother me to watch Elf (2003) with Will F. ,So after a while I decide to see it and we (my Family) love him,then there is Kevin Hart also one of the grater in comedy so the two combine in a movie I was like OMG ,What a disappointment!!!! I know we are in 2015 but if you consider your self a great comedy person, you don't need all that stupidity of nonsense nudity about showing part and breast ,if I want to see that kind of stuff i'll get myself a x movie,come on!!

159,curtissettles,"expected a much better movie, I left the theater a little disappointed",3,28 March 2015,"This movie had a few dry spots...poor writing in my opinion.. I do like Will and Kevin but this fell way short of funny. Some of the scenes were drawn out for too long which took away the humor like wringing out a wet rag until its bone dry. Both Kevin and Will are much funnier than what was portrayed in Get Hard. In fact, when they appeared on The Late Show with Jimmy Fallon they killed it. Will Ferrell did his version of Beyonces' Drunkin Love and had my wife and I in stitches. Now that was funnier than most of the scenes in the movie, not to mention that was just a two minute performance. I don't want to discourage anyone from going to check out the film, but if you've seen the commercial then you've seen the best parts.",Get Hard

To enjoy this movie it could help to be familiar with the rap scene such as watching Boys in the Hood as there are a lot of references to the movie. It is also offensive so you need to know what to expect. I love offensive humor so this was perfect for me. Will plays a self absorbed racist billionaire who is trying to learn how to survive in Prison. Kevin plays his usual character acting like he knows prison and teaches Will the ropes. I'll say Kevin short jokes ""jumping to see"" are getting old and Genital shots are getting old.",Get Hard

One of the best Comedy's I've seen!,10,31 March 2015,"I had recently seen this movie with my mother and before I left to see the movie I looked at the reviews for this movie on IMDb and most of them were awful! I actually got scared to see the movie thinking I might waste my money, but this was simply not the case.This movie was so freaking funny that me, my mother, and almost everyone else in the audience were balling over laughing. It was so hilarious! I definitely want to see this again, the only reason I'm giving this movie a 9 is because the plot and the ending alike is quite predictable. But besides that it was fantastic. However yeah there are some discrimination/ racist jokes/comments in there but honestly it's a comedy! It's not suppose to be taken seriously! They have gotten all of the commonly known stereotypes and embraced them and made fun of them, people get so Butthurt about this. It's suppose to be taken lightly.

I would highly recommend not taking a young kid to see this movie I would also not recommend seeing if you were not a fan of such shows as family guy or any thing on adult swim. There is nudity in the movie but only will feral's butt and chest. Other then that this movie is a Certainly see again Also there is no only the trailer had the good parts Just about ever scene had funny parts It was not boring and was not movie you have to wait for it to get good I would say bring your friends,Get Hard

It was just TERRIBLE! I HATE IT, I HATE IT, I HATE IT!!!!! I would have been better off staying at home. Had fun with my friends, but HATED THE MOVIE.

It is that bad.I like Will Farrell and Adam Sandler movies, and expect them to be dumb. But I also expect them to be funny. This was just dumb.This movie is like watching ""Idiocracy"" come true in real time.Normally, I would say, ""If you like ____, then you'll like this movie"". I can't think of anything to fill in that blank in this case.I guess if you are so enamored with Will Farrell that you'd pay $9.50 to see him create a Jackson Pollock painting with his explosive diarrhea, then this movie is for you.It just isn't funny.

165,CinemaFox,'Get Hard will make you laugh',7,20 May 2016,"""Dick-ade doesn't sound like a significant improvement over dick.""I hate when people complain about offensive humour (talking to all the feminazis, SJW's, neckbeard MRA's and culture vultures) because it is mindlessly immature and funny in situation like this. To start, this movie had a decent premise, kevin hart has to teach Will Ferrell to survive in jail. Awesome idea for a comedy. Does this movie fulfil it's potential? Kinda. On one hand, the chemistry between the two actors is great, I love how will Ferrell has to fit in with the ghetto and I loved the amount of slapstick comedy this had to offer. However, there were some points in the movie where I thought it would be easier to just move the conversation along as nothing particularly funny was happening. Overall, Get Hard will make you laugh for the majority of your experience and is filled with offensive humour and stereotypes.67/100",Get Hard
166,jimhocn,Classic Kevin Hart's type of humour,7,26 July 2015,"Yes, I watched this movie because of Kevin Hart. It is a good movie, if what you expect is just some laughters after a long week.Hart shows his typical sense of humour in this movie, with the exaggerated lines and body languages. It is fun, but I would expect a little bit more from this famous comedian. I hadn't watched a movie acted by Will Ferrell before, at least not that I recalled. But he is definitely one of the reasons that you should watch this movie. He acts a wise man in this movie but behaves like a fool when he is facing that fact that he may not survive in jail, which freaks him out and shakes like a baby. You would be amused when he learns to survive in jail and amazed by the same guy when he realizes he should stand up for himself.All in all, it is a hilarious movie. The reason that I didn't rate it higher over 7 out of 10, is that the storyline may need more efforts. If you are an audience who values the logic of story lines very much, this movie may not be the best choice for you. If just for some laughters, I guess you just find yourself a good movie to show and give you what you want.",Get Hard
167,caroline_marino,Dogging of Pitbulls,2,9 August 2015,"I love Will Ferrell but once the dog breed of Pitbulls was portrayed negatively, I was mad. Let's stop the bad portrayal of this wonderful breed of animal. I have only seen one other movie with Kevin Hart who I had no knowledge of before recently. That was Wedding Ringer and it wasn't too great either. This movie was sad at best and when a dog breed is portrayed as mean or vicious just because the director writer doesn't have any idea of what that breed is, well, this movie is dumb. Gratuitous violence, language, sex, erroneous information. Dumb movie, bad plot, not sure what value this brings to society, etc. Very crude and rude.",Get Hard
168,spc-vanrijn,Very Entertaining!,8,26 August 2015,"Darnell wants to give James his keys for his car, but James refuses to look at Darnell and yells that he is being attacked. James only thinks this because Darnell is black and after he saw Darnell was just going to give him his keys he stepped out of his car and said: I would have done the same if you were white. The movie is about James King (Will Ferrell), a Billionaire who is sentenced to prison for 10 years because of massive stock fraud. James has 30 days to get his affairs ready and to ''Get Hard'' because San Quentin isn't exactly the best prison to be in. He then meets Darwell (Kevin Hart) who is going to help him to Get Hard by training him and turning his house into a prison. James chose Darnell to train him because James thought he went to prison just because he was black and had low education. This is one example of the many racist jokes. I found this movie very entertaining because it was really unpredictable and just at the end you would know who was the guy who got him sentenced for 10 years. The way James met Darnell was very funny too because Darnell was his car cleaner man when he was rich and because he is black so James assumed he went to prison. The plot was very good and unpredictable at the same time. Because in the last 30 minutes every other 10 minutes the enemies were winning and 10 minutes later James and Darnell Overall I think it is a very entertaining movie and I would definitely recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor and has a night off. This movie is best suited for men because of the racism, sexist jokes, cursing and fighting.I hope you liked my review. Thank you for reading",Get Hard

The movie is a disgrace and an insult to all movie makers who really try to entertain. Especially the performance of Will Farell is atrocious. The actor is not funny and cannot act.
