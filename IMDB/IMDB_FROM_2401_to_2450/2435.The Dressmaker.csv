0,SnoopyStyle,weird collection of characters,6,5 January 2018,"It's 1951. Fashionable Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) returns to her rural hometown of Dungatar, Australia. Her delusional mother (Judy Davis) lives in their rundown family home. Twenty five years earlier, she was banished for suspicion of murder which she does not remember. She seeks the truth and revenge for the guilty. Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) is a friendly neighbor. Sergeant Horatio Farrat (Hugo Weaving) is a cross-dresser.This is filled with a collection of strange characters. The movie is set to be a weird dark disturbing affair. I don't care that much about the dressmaking except for helping Tilly to solve the 25 year old case. I'm not always a fan of extensive flashbacks but this movie needs it. The most compelling aspect is the mystery of the boy's death. The movie is energized whenever Tilly starts solving the case. The present is less compelling than the past. The pacing does struggle at times. It takes a darker turn after solving the case. In a way, the movie starts anew after the climax which is often problematic. There are many issues. It tries to be quirky light comedy at times which fit uncomfortably with the dark material. This is possibly a better fit for a mini-series where the various twists can be given a cliffhanger and room to breathe. There are some great sections but it's bumpy ride.",The Dressmaker
1,kosmasp,Nice fit,8,8 August 2016,"This is really dark and I have to admit I did not expect it. Kate is really relishing the role plays here and she is really good in it (of course she's a great actress). The role she has to play has a past that she has to wrestle with. A past that is well hidden from the viewer and something that will be revealed in time.It's nicely told (and hopefully the major plot point is not revealed in the trailer, which I obviously haven't seen) and has a really good pace for a drama/thriller to it. Add a bit of romance to the mix and you get a really fine end product. Acting is generally very good (Hugo Weaving is another major standout, though it's really tough to pick favorites, they are all having a blast and it translates to screen) as is direction and design. Especially the clothing is phenomenal too. A really good dark and sinister little movie, that knows how to shock",The Dressmaker
2,lee_eisenberg,glamour comes to the Outback,10,31 January 2017,"With revenge depicted violently in Quentin Tarantino's movies, it's an interesting change to see it depicted subtly in ""The Dressmaker"". Kate Winslet plays a fashion maven who returns to her hometown in rural Australia to take care of her mentally unstable mother. But she also seeks to get even with those who wronged her years earlier.Winslet's character is the embodiment of 1950s high society, and so naturally when she returns to this podunk town they basically view her as a prostitute.* But it turns out that plenty of the townspeople have their own little secrets (namely the sergeant). The best part is the trick that Winslet's character plays on everyone towards the end of the movie. Judy Davis, as Winslet's character's mother, is actually the most interesting character in the whole movie. I got the feeling that the events of previous years had damaged her.I had never heard of Jocelyn Moorhouse before watching this movie. It turns out that she had directed some movies. Having seen ""The Dressmaker"", I'd like to see her previous movies, and I hope that she continues making these sorts of movies.*If ""trollopes"" look like that, then bring 'em on!",The Dressmaker
3,blanche-2,Living well should be the best revenge...,7,14 June 2017,"...but in the case of Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) a few things need to be straightened out.Thus, the stunning Tilly returns to her home in Dungatar, Australia, back to her alcoholic mother (Judy Davis) who acts like she doesn't remember her and is thought of as the town slut, and back to a town that considers Tilly herself a murderer. Tilly cleans her mother's house and throws the woman in a tub, and then tries to find out what happened fifteen years ago that caused her to be sent away. It is believed by the town that she killed Stewart Pettyman when they were both children. Why can't she remember it?Now a designer in Paris, Tilly soon attracts a clientele of local women who love her chic designs. She also attracts Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth), the town hunk.Slowly, Tilly finds out the town's secrets, which include a cross- dressing sheriff (Hugo Weaving). He's the least of it.This is a story of redemption and revenge, deliciously told by director Jocelyn Moorhouse and her dynamite cast. Everyone, including the town's old biddies, are wonderful. Sarah Snook, as the impossibly homely Trudy, gets one of the all-time makeovers and is a sight to behold.A few cultural references that weren't quite right: The film appears to take place in 1950 - Tilly, Teddy, and her mother Molly go to see Sunset Boulevard. However, they listen to the soundtrack of South Pacific from 1958 and OKlahoma from 1955. So when the film takes place is anybody's guess - I didn't read the book.All in all, a mixture of dark comedy and drama that is ultimately satisfying. Tilly proves that revenge is a dish best served cold, even in Australia's hot climate.",The Dressmaker
4,neil-476,Weird and wonderful,8,27 November 2015,"The tiny Australian town of Dungatar, which appears to be constructed out of corrugated iron and dust, is home to a small population of mainly picturesque eccentrics and poisonous women. Dressmaker Tilly (Kate Winslet) returns to Dungatar after being driven away when she was 10 for murdering a classmate. Her remarkable dressmaking skills earn her some brownie points, but the old wounds are far from healed.This extremely odd film defies classification. It is often very funny, sometimes mystifying, always intriguing, sometimes tragic, and boasts some terrific performances and some sights you never expected to see, most of them involving Hugo Weaving. And the story keeps you constantly interested and keen to find out what happens next. Liam Hemsworth does some shirtless stuff, if that floats your boat (and it floats a couple of boats in the film). Judy Davies, an actress I have never liked, made me cry. The dresses made by Winslet's character (and her competitor) are visually impressive and sometimes hilarious. The people who populate Dungatar are not believable for an instant, but they work wonderfully well as characters.This is a truly weird film, but I really liked it.",The Dressmaker
5,ferguson-6,drinking game - count the genres and subplots,7,29 September 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes we just have to give thanks (and credit) to a filmmaker for boldly stepping out of the Hollywood box and delivering a cinematic experience that is creative, interesting and downright unusual. Such is the case with director Jocelyn Moorhouse and her first film since A Thousand Acres (1997).We know immediately that we are in for something a bit different. A1950's era bus rolls down the dusty road and stops in a desolate little Aussie town with only a handful of store fronts. Western-style music accompanies Kate Winslet as she steps off the bus brandishing a Singer sewing machine rather than a Winchester or Colt. She lights up a cigarette, squints out from under her hat, and utters one of the more memorable first lines of any movie. We are hooked. (You had me at ""bastards"") What follows is based on Rosalie Ham's best-selling novel with a screenplay from the director and PJ Hogan (Muriel's Wedding, 1997), and features a most remarkable blend of slapstick comedy, dark humor, tragedy, romance, mystery, and revenge. At times the film has a Coen Brothers or Wes Anderson feel, while at various other moments it recalls the Keystone Cops, Chocolat, a spaghetti western and a spoof of  well it's difficult to say whether it's a spoof or homage to numerous genres.Ms. Winslet is in full lead mode as Tilly  the local girl who was accused of murder at age ten and banished from her mother and hometown. After 25 years, Tilly returns to Dungatar in an attempt to reconnect with her mom, gain a bit of revenge on the petty townfolks, and remember that fateful day that has been blocked from her memory. The tool of her trade is a sewing machine (and at times a golf club) and Tilly has the magic touch to transform the local ladies into more attractive and confident versions of themselves. She wields her Singer with every bit of danger as Blondie (Clint Eastwood) did with his revolver in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.Judy Davis (A Passage to India) is fantastic as Tilly's mother ""Mad"" Molly. In a role that would have been pure caricature in different hands (Maggie Smith), Ms. Davis provides a depth and humanity to a role that is truly the heart of the film. Also excellent is Hugo Weaving as the local Police Sergeant who has his own secret quirks and guilty conscience, and is one of the first to appreciate the talents Tilly brings to the small town. Liam Hemsworth spends the movie grinning and gazing in the role of arm candy Teddy – one easily recognizable as the female role in most movies (those not directed by a woman). The deep cast always features Sarah Snook as Gertrude and Kerry Fox as the villainous school marm Beulah (replete with devilish hairdo).While the story itself is relatively predictable, it's the manner in which scenes are staged that makes this such a pleasure. The offbeat combination of desolate Aussie town and near cartoon characters are set against the colorful and textured world of highly fashionable clothes, wicked twists, twisted humor, reconciliation and tragedy – many scenes combining more than a couple of these.Marion Boyce and Margot Wilson deserve special attention for costume design, as the costumes themselves play as characters to contrast the local atmosphere. It's startling to realize that such a coherent story utilizes such topics as domestic violence, spousal rape, misogyny, cross-dressing, murder, perjury, blackmail, Billie Holliday, South Pacific, cannabis brownies, and Sunset Boulevard in such creative ways. Though many critics will not agree, Ms. Moorhouse has delivered an entertaining and accessible movie despite its complexity with multiple subplots and various undertones. Let's hope she doesn't wait 20 years for her next film project.",The Dressmaker
6,HotToastyRag,Too weird for me,1,13 June 2019,"In this quirky Australian drama, a woman in the 1950s returns to her small hometown with a sewing machine and a grudge. When she was a child, many people in the town either participated in a great wrong done to her or stood idly by as it happened, and she wants to make them pay. While parts of the movie appear very fluffy and silly, it's always clear there's a very dark tone ready to surface at any moment.I didn't make it through the entire movie, as it became too strange for me to enjoy. Kate Winslet attends a rugby match and takes off her clothes, glad when the players are distracted enough to crash into each other. That's her revenge? She gives a homely girl a makeover only to show her ugliness at the right time so her boyfriend doesn't want her anymore. That's her revenge? Obviously not, and these events are just building to something more sinister later in the film. I didn't have the patience to see what sort of evil revenge scheme she really had in mind, but if you like those types of movies, you can try it out. It was just far too weird for me.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due mature subject matter, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",The Dressmaker
7,phd_travel,Something different,9,29 January 2016,"Delightful, exaggerated and fanciful, feel good and tragic, this movie set in an Australian small town is something different. The use of fashion as a weapon is quite hilarious especially set in the background of the podunk town. The scene with Sarah Snook's dance transformation and wedding dress incident are quite funny and amazing. There is a deeper more serious message about the small town mentality.A dressmaker (Winslet) returns to a small town that sent her away as a young girl after a young boy was killed years ago. She reconnects with her eccentric mother and the residents of the town.The acting is superb from Judy Davis in particular. She is fantastic is Mad Molly. Kate looks elegant if slightly plump in her couture outfits. Surprisingly she doesn't look too old for a bearded Liam Hemsworth who plays her charming if impulsive love interest. The accents aren't too thick so things are understandable.Kind of wished there had been a happier ending. Still worth watching - it will surprise you.",The Dressmaker
8,MOscarbradley,Daft and surprisingly dark,8,3 March 2017,"This surprising and over-the-top comedy-drama offers the likes of Kate Winslet, Judy Davis and Hugo Weaving the chance to overact with impunity so it's nice to see them keep their performances in check while it gives the youngest of the Hemsworth brothers (Liam) the opportunity to show off his eye-candy status while keeping his acting skills under wraps. It's both daft and darker than you might expect though ultimately it's Davis, as always, who lends it a touch of class. If director Jocelyn Moorhouse though she was making some kind of feminist statement she was very much mistaken; this is basically a period fantasy in fancy clothes, beautifully photographed by Donald McAlpine with a decent enough story that is just weird enough to make the whole thing interesting. For some reason it didn't take off with either the critics or the public but I have a feeling it could be heading for cult status within the next few years. Seek it out.",The Dressmaker
9,dromasca,dresses and death down-under,8,17 June 2016,"The Dressmaker brings to screen a successful Australian novel by Rosalie Ham who sets her 1950s story in a small dessert town in the middle of the big Nowhere which is the Australian wilderness. It's one of these 'out-of-the-track' films which generates extreme opinions and wins lovers and haters, because one needs to like films with weird characters and situations, accept a story that departs from the usual right vs. evil conditions, and stop considering real life credibility as a principal criteria to evaluate a movie.Apparently this is a story of home coming, of lost memory and revenge, with Mirtle 'Tilly' Dunnage coming home to imaginary Dungatar Many years after she was sent away ostracized for allegedly killing another kid at the age of 10. The ugly crying kid has turned into a beautiful and elegant woman (Kate Winslet) who not only attracts the stares of the male population and envy of the feminine one, but will also change their lives in many ways. She does not remember a thing about the crime that she is accused of having committed in childhood and will try to bring back the memories and put her life back on track.Director Jocelyn Moorhouse at her 5th film made after 18 years of interruption in her career chose a mix of styles and genres. Some of the ('professional') critics that I have read blame her for not picking and sticking to one well-known pattern. Is this film a comedy, a romantic story, a feminist drama, a revenge saga, a bloody action movie? I would say that the quality of the film resides in the fact that it is all of these combined and more.Then we have the fashion story. Tilly has become a dressmaker in Europe and will use her skills to change the appearances and the lives of the women in the village. The classic Greek saying 'The man is his clothes' better known in English by 'clothes make the man' (Shakespeare used it among other) was never better served. I found the idea charming, it also remembered me the story of a lesser known Israeli film 'Turn Left at the End of the World' in which it is cricket that changes the lives of the inhabitants of a desert town.The movie is enjoyable because of a few splendid acting parts. I especially enjoyed Judy Davis as the apparently demented mother of Tilly, and sparkling Hugo Weaving as the man of the law who secretly loves wearing dresses and ribbons. Kate Winslet is strong and expressive, but the miscasting of her handsome peer Liam Hemsworth was very evident. She seems to be a bit too old for her role, he seems to be a little bit too young for the role. But again, maybe even this miscasting is intentional, and the director gave us one more warning to take the story and the world she created in a non-realistic manner. Her world in its splendid isolation, with its characters that are rather archetypes that real life characters mostly in the comic registry reminded me another lesser know film - the Romanian 'Somewhere in Palilula'. Tragic death and violence will make their appearance, but terror is inflicted mainly by shooting golf balls, and eventually all falls into farce. Did I mention Tarantino?",The Dressmaker
10,cosmo_tiger,"A surprisingly great film. A type of murder mystery disguised as a movie about sewing. It had shades of Dogville, which I loved",10,22 December 2016,"""She's back! The murderess is back!"" Tilly Dunnage (Winslet) has just returned to her hometown after many many years away. When she returns, the memory of her murdering a class mate also comes back among the town. Little by little she begins to transform the townspeople with her sewing and style. Something's cannot be changed and revenge and redemption is on everyone's mind. This is a movie that is nothing like I expected. I was expecting something along the lines of a chick flick and sat down to watch without any really sense of excitement. Little by little that changed and by the end I was almost smiling and was very happy I watched this. I don't want to give anything away but the movie was very reminiscent of Dogville. I loved that movie and this one was almost as good. It is rare that I am as surprised as I was at this movie. Overall, not what I expected at all, it was much much better. A type of murder mystery disguised as a movie about sewing. I highly recommend this. I give it a A+.",The Dressmaker
11,tabuno,Not Since Dogville!,9,11 January 2019,"24 February 2017. The most intriguing aspect of this movie is its indescribability, like even more so than Dogville (2003). Is it a drama, a thriller, a mystery, or comedy? The cast of characters is varied and in some cases very stylistic, yet charmingly deceptive. In what might be considered one of the most difficult directorial and edited films, The Dressmaker abounds with treacherous tonality changes which could sink this movie by riddling it with psychologically conflicting backlashes making the movie almost impossible to watch.Kate Winslet offers up a superb performance and script twists manage to jar the audience with some amazing emotional transitions making The Dressmaker something closer to an entertaining psychological thriller with hidden mystery and whimsical humor. This is both a funny but darkly sad movie. The entire production is unique, well crafted and perfectly suited to the big screen. This is both a light but complex and intricate movie.Dark Shadows (2012), Margot at the Wedding (2007), Chocolat (2001) are other similar themed movies.",The Dressmaker
12,Reno-Rangan,Home is where the vengeance is.,8,4 May 2016,"A stylish Aussie revenge-comedy that is adapted from a novel of the same name. Just superbly built screenplay on a tragedy that occurred some time back, but the movie reveals it only in the third act. About a woman who arrives in a small town where she was born and slowly gains popularity among the young women who seeks her stunning costumes to impress their counterparts. The town divides over her return, but why all the hate is the mystery that the movie going to solve for us in its entire narration.The location and the settings were fantastic and it brought a western feel because of the Australians hot and humid weather. Kate Winslate was very good, her role simply reminded me Juliette Binoche from 'Chocolat'. I have heard people saying it was emotional, but I did not find it like that. Instead, I had fun watching it, not like I had the open laughs, but felt joy and satisfaction for the time I spent for it. My initial thought was it could be overrated, but after watching it proved I was wrong. This is one of the best Aussie movie I have seen in the recent years.8/10",The Dressmaker
13,Red-125,"OK--Kate Winslet is beautiful, but the movie isn't that great",7,12 October 2016,"The Dressmaker (2015/I) was co-written and directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse. It stars Kate Winslet as Tilly Dunnage, who has returned to rural Australia from Paris to care for her ailing mother, Molly (Judy Davis). We know from the first scene that Tilly is out for revenge. What it is that she needs to revenge, and how she goes about achieving revenge, is at the heart of the plot.Although, naturally, the acting of the two leads was excellent, the movie just didn't work for me. For one thing, it's too long. We get a climactic scene, and then some flashbacks, then another climactic scene, and more flashbacks. After 90 minutes I was ready for the movie to end. No luck--it was a big-budget film, and they were going to show it to us for two hours. (Kate Winslet doesn't give her talent away, and if she's starring in your movie, you may as well make sure that she has plenty of screen time.)The supporting cast was strong. Maybe, in the 1950's, people in rural Australia were as stereotypically horrible as the people in this town were portrayed. Maybe someone could return from France and wreak revenge on everyone. Or, then again, maybe not.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It will work almost as well on the small screen, although you won't appreciate the vast, empty countryside as well as you would in a theater. IMDb reviewers have given this film a rating of 7.1, and I agree with that level as appropriate. The Dressmaker isn't bad, but it's not great either.",The Dressmaker
14,leonblackwood,Thoroughly entertaining throughout! 6/10,6,20 March 2016,"Review: The first hour of this movie was really funny but then it seemed to go down a dark avenue of mysterious deaths in the little town of Dungatar. The storyline was truly unique and Kate Winslet (Tilly Dunnage) and July Davis (Molly) were great and it was good to see Hugo Weaving (Sergeant Farrat), parading himself in women's clothing again, as he did in the Adventures of Priscilla Queen of the Desert, but once the love story kicked in between Tilly and Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) the film seemed to slow down a little. The mixture of humour and intense drama, was great throughout the film and there is so much happening, which keeps the movie interesting. Its mainly about Tilly Dunnage, who is banished from her small town at a young age, after she is accused of killing a young boy, who is the town bully, so she is sent to boarding school, leaving her frail mother, Molly, behind. Tilly goes on to become a successful dressmaker in Paris but when she returns home to be with her sick mother, her troubled past is still in the villagers minds. Whilst building a relationship with her mother, who is suffering with selective amnesia, she starts to build a relationship with the people in town, by making them dresses for various occasions. She also builds a relationship with Teddy McSwiney, who she completely falls in love with but she still thinks that she is cursed and that bad thinks happen around her. After planning to run away with Teddy, her whole world apart, and she ends up losing everyone that she loves, including the trustee local police officer, Sergeant Farrat, who helped her prove that she really didn't kill the young boy when she was little. When she finally gets pushed to the edge, she takes matters into her own hands and then she hits the road again, with her sewing machine in hand. Its a truly inspiring story about a strong woman who goes out of her way to build a relationship with her mother but the whole curse side of the movie, went haywire after a while. I was quite shocked with the way the director changed the direction of the film at various points throughout the film, which made it entertaining and definitely worth a watch. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After starring in this biggest movie of all time, Kate Winslet, 40 has taken on very few projects which haven't really blown up at the box office but she has proved that she is worthy of her Oscar, which she received for the Reader in 2009. She was great in Holy Smoke, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Little Children, Revolutionary Road and Carnage and with Steve Jobs, Insurgent and Triple 9 yet to be released in the UK, she is slowly climbing back up the ranks to reach the stardom that she gained after starring in Titanic. Her performance in this movie was great and the chemistry between Kate and Judy Davis was brilliant, so it's good to see her back on the big screen after disappearing out of the spotlight for so long. Anyway, this movie was directed by Jocelyn Moorhouse, 55, who brought you Proof in 1991 with a young looking Russell Crowe, How To Make An American Quilt in 1995 and A Thousand Acres in 1997, starring Jessica Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer. Although this movie was pushed back a year because of Kate Winslet's pregnancy, it was definitely worth the wait and the costumes that were used throughout the movie were pretty impressive. Its one of those movies that have ""chick flick"" written all over it but from a man's point of view, I found it funny and entertaining. Budget: $12million Worldwide Gross: $19millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their dramatic movies starring Kate Winslet, Liam Hemsworth, Sarah Snook, Hugo Weaving, Judy Davis and Kerry Fox. 6/10",The Dressmaker
15,l_rawjalaurence,What a Disappointment,5,8 September 2016,"Jocelyn Moorhouse's work promises so much, yet delivers so little in the end.The plot is brilliantly set up; set in a backwater of rural Australia in the early Fifties among a small community too well acquainted with each other's social mores, it centers on the return of a prodigal daughter (Kate Winslet) to stay with her mother (Judy Davis) after a prolonged absence. Neither of the siblings appear to get on; in fact, the mother appears not to want to know the daughter.Life appears to continue on its own sweet way in the community; but there appears to be something wrong. No one really acknowledges the daughter Myrtle (aka Tilly's) presence, until they discover her remarkable talent at dress-making. In a series of sequences highly reminiscent of any drawing-room comedy, scruples are shed, as the local women seek to better themselves by ordering a series of increasingly fancy frocks from Myrtle.Through this comic structure director Moorhouse explores the often threatening influence of the past and how it continues to cast a blight over the present, despite Tilly's best attempts to contend with it. Both herself and her mother have historically represented challenges to the established social status quo, and they will never escape the stigmas attacked. The fact that villagers are equally morally culpable - although they stringently deny it - is but another layer of irony added to an exceptionally subtle piece.In the end matters come to a head at a village wedding, where the past is revisited and Tilly learns at last what really happened to her when she was a child, and why she was so cruelly sent away. At this point we understand just how limited in terms of scope rural communities actually were, despite their surface assumption of manners and their willing embrace of commercialism (as symbolized through the easy availability of gramophone records).Yet it is here that the film falls apart. Incident follows incident with very little narrative cohesion, almost as if the filmmakers are trying their utmost to forge a happy ending and allow Tilly to leave her hometown with her head held high and the demons exorcized for good. There is a particularly spurious sequence involving a rendition from Gilbert and Sullivan's THE MIKADO, followed by a sequence out of Shakespeare's MACBETH that would not have seemed out of place in a remake of BLACKADDER 3.The action is at least half an hour too long; by the end viewers are wanting for it to end.",The Dressmaker
16,paul-allaer,Nothing like I expected it to be,3,4 October 2016,"""The Dressmaker"" (2015 release from Australia; 118 min.) brings the story of Tilly (played by Kate Winslet). As the movie opens, we are reminded this is ""Dungatar, Australia, 1951"", and we see Tilly arrive in town late at night. ""I'm back, bastards!"", Tilly proclaims to no-one in particular. Tilly goes to her mom Molly (played by Judy Davis). Her mom's house is a total mess, to Tilly's chagrin. The next day we get to know a bunch of the town's characters, and everyone is in a tizzy about Tilly's return. Why indeed has she come back after all these years? Was Tilly somehow involved in the murder of a young boy some 20+ years ago? At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Australian producer-director Jocelyn Moorhouse, best known in the US for ""Muriel's Wedding"". Here she transposes the book of the same name onto the big screen. I wasn't all that familiar with the it, other than it involves some unresolved murder case. Hence I was expecting a crime drama of some sort. Turns out I was completely wrong, and in fact this is an all-out comedy, with zero drama. I knew I was in trouble when Winslet's character proclaims early on ""I'm back, bastards!"", tongue firmly planted in cheek. I couldn't get into the movie whatsoever, and was bored out of my mind, with zero emotional investment as to any of these characters. ""If I wanted to kill you, I'd break your neck"", Winslet's character comments later on, and I was thinking ""please do! maybe that will generate some much needed tension"", but alas, it doesn't happen. Some may think that this is a ""chick's flick"", and that may be the case, but I respectfully disagree that this is the reason I didn't like the movie. I came into the movie expecting a crime drama or psychological thriller or character study of some sort, and the movie is none of these. I recognize this can happen from time to time (I'd rather not know too much of a movie going in), and I've been pleasantly surprised on many occasions, but here it simply didn't pan out, sorry.""The Dressmaker"" premiered at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, yes, over a year ago. No idea why this recently showed up out of the blue at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati.

I really cannot recommend this movie, and the only reason that I give it 3 stars is because of Kate Winslet, whose screen presence cannot be denied.

17,robert-temple-1,"An uneasy mix, an uneasy story",6,30 April 2016,"This film based on a novel by Rosalie Ham is set in a tiny and extremely remote village in Australia in the 1950s. The central element of the story is the return of a young woman to this village which she left as a child. The main character is admirably played by Kate Winslet, with her usual shadings of emotion and her admirable skill. She has come for two reasons, to try to re-examine her origins and childhood, and also to wreak vengeance upon those who have wronged her. The main motif of this film thus resembles that of Friedrich Duerenmatt's famous play THE VISIT, which was so brilliantly filmed in 1964 by Bernhard Wicki, with Ingrid Bergman as the woman who returns, and Anthony Quinn as the male lead. That film has undeservedly disappeared from notice, but it was one of the most powerful films made anywhere in the world in the mid-sixties, and contains one of Ingrid Bergman's finest performances of her career. (The next time I watch it, I shall review it.) It used to be impossible to find, but it is now available on DVD, although so few people are aware of its existence that it remains little known. This new film entirely fails to exploit the powerful theme of a woman returning to her village or small town for vengeance. Instead, the director Joselyn Moorhouse (an Ossie by birth) makes excessive excursions into wildly over-the-top satire on small Australian communities (which are also portrayed as intrinsically evil) and attempts at broad humour which are also overdone. Perhaps the humour is some kind of local Australian gnomic humour which those of us who are not Ossies simply cannot grasp. But many of these attempts are just silly. Moorhouse was not cut out for making comedies, and should not try, because she clearly has no reliable comic judgement. The story is thus diluted, like a whiskey and soda with far too much soda and barely any whiskey. One knows the film could have been very powerful, but the focus was lost and it just does not make the grade at all. This is a great pity, and an opportunity wasted. The director clearly never made up her mind whether she was making a tragedy or a comedy, and since she is not Shakespeare (she also collaborated on the script), she could not successfully mix the two. So few people can that it is usually a mistake to try. Despite the best efforts of Winslet and of Judy Davis as her mother, with good support from others as well, the sprawling and blurred uncertainty of the director's intentions left one wondering just what her purpose in making the film really was. The film is entertaining because everyone tries so hard. But it does not actually 'work', and is like one of those inferior Chinese takeaways that leaves you hungry again five minutes later.",The Dressmaker

Not as much as I like Hugh Weaving in it, however. He was the strongest laugh I got from the film. So, it's suppose to be a comedy, but I did not laugh really.",The Dressmaker
19,iquine,Clunky Screenplay and Tone,3,4 October 2018,"(Flash Review)A woman returns to a small and isolated rural town in Australia wearing a fashionable dress and carrying a Singer sewing machine. You quickly learn this woman was accused of murder as young school girl and has returned to visit her mother who the town has never liked; perhaps that is why they were quick to accuse her daughter. The townsfolk are suspect of her return but quickly warm to her as she creates and provides dresses for the women so they can get a leg up in a cross-town competition; seemed like they were too easily wooed by some well-sewn fashion if they still think of her as a murderer. There is also a miscasting for the romantic angle with Winslet being way too old to rekindle a school girl crush with a younger looking Hemsworth, which aside from that was also feebly written. Overall, it had a grating soundtrack, jarring and abrupt story flow including an unconvincing mix of tones and not good character management.",The Dressmaker
20,jimbo-53-186511,Where do I even start? (MAJOR SPOILERS),3,19 March 2016,"When this film started my early impressions of it were good; we have Kate Winslet arriving back in Australia very much playing against type as a 'bad-ass' women seeking revenge. Upon hearing her mutter the line 'I have a score to settle here' I thought Yes this is going to be a really good revenge film. I really couldn't have been more wrong....Tonally & narratively The Dressmaker is a complete mess and it seemed obvious after about the first 20-30 minutes that the filmmakers seemed to be unsure how to actually play this film; from the outset it seems to be about Kate Winslet exacting revenge against those that have wronged her as a child - however this aspect is then ignored for large portions of the film and then starts to become a melodrama focusing on the fraught & rather strained relationship between mother and daughter. I realise that a lot of narratives will focus on different themes during their running time, but in The Dressmaker a lot of the time it's feels like you're watching a sketch-show i.e a series of unrelated incidents strung together with very little connecting these scenes together. This is OK in sketch-shows because that's the point of them, but in a film there needs to be some kind of logical flow and some sort of cohesion to connect everything together, but there is little evidence of that here. As well as purportedly being about revenge and self-discovery the film also throws in other random nonsense such as a wedding which had nothing to do with the story, one character who is a police sergeant who likes to dress up in women's clothing (which isn't particularly funny in the first place). The film also flits backwards and forwards covering the same ground which makes it also feel very repetitive - this isn't helped by the fact that the film flits backwards and forwards a lot whilst doing little to actually move anything forward!!!. The romance between Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth was nauseating and totally unconvincing - there was just no chemistry there at all and every time I saw the pair of them on screen together they made me cringe... Another issue with this film is that the people and the scenarios never feel believable. I mean the last time I saw that many crazy people together was when I watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest. There are some funny moments, but sometimes the filmmakers just go overboard and mostly create scenarios that seem more surreal than real. This set-up is amusing at first, but just gets more tiresome and less and less believable the further things progress....There were other things I didn't understand such as how come Myrtle/Tilly and her mother couldn't remember that she'd allegedly killed someone? And how come later they were able to recall the event? It's never confirmed that they've suffered amnesia or such like and we're not given any explanation for their lapses in memory or them suddenly regaining their memories.Although it generally seems like it's pointless the film does eventually start to make its point (about 2/3 of the way into the film). It throws in various twists such as the boy killing himself as opposed to Myrtle/Tilly killing him. The deceased boy being her brother and the dead boy's father also being her father. Despite the fact that it seemed to be trying to create a 'thought-provoking' ending about moral decency it undoes itself when we learn that Myrtle/Tilly's father sent her away to get back at her mum which in turn causes Tilly to exact her revenge on all of the locals??? Even with some of the clever twists it's still a very weak film with a rather unrewarding pay-off.Thankfully, some of the performances in this film are excellent and really help to raise this film from the doldrums; Judy Davis is brilliant as Kate Winslet's mother and rising star Sarah Snook was also very good. Hugo Weaving is normally a reliable actor but he was uncharacteristically poor here (but then look at what he had to work with). Hemsworth smiles a lot and takes off his shirt but contributes little else. Kate Winslet puts in an above average performance but she wasn't the star of the show as far as I was concerned.The Dressmaker is roundly a poor film but it does benefit from some very good performances and Judy Davis is responsible for a lot of the comedy moments which does make the film tolerable on odd occasions.",The Dressmaker
21,dierregi,All dressed up and nowhere to go,3,13 January 2019,"Some Australian movies can be very Australian, but easily exportable and loved all around the world (Strictly ballroom, Priscilla, Muriel's wedding). They mix great costumes and locations with social commentary and produce great results. The same cannot be said for this one.It starts well, with Kate Winslet as Tilly, going back home to her little village in the Australian outback. This is the 50s, but the scene works as a Western, with the hero getting off the train in a dusty town, armed only with his courage and a gun. Tilly is armed with a sewing machine. She is a great seamstress and she is here to rescue Molly, her mother, from the village and to find the truth about what happened during her childhood.So far so good, but then we're presented with a cast of equally despicable villagers, all bent to dislike and hate Tilly and Molly. The latter is played by Judy Davis, an actress I usually like, but found way over the top in this movie. Molly has allegedly forgotten everything that happened to her daughter and claims not to even recognised her.The whole ""revenge"" plot is then derailed into an unlikely love story, which turns out to be a red herring. Tilly is still bent on revenge, but I could not stop wondering why she wasted so much time to work on her revenge and why instead of buying into her lover plan to leave the village with her mother ,when they could have....The whole story dragged on far too long, there is way too much screaming and Hugo Weaving's police sergeant is too much of a caricature, besides being a major time consuming plot device. Excellent costumes, though.",The Dressmaker
22,kz917-1,Couture can be deadly!,9,3 April 2017,"Fantastique! The cast, the costumes, the story all of it was impeccable. From the opening line, ""I'm back you bastards!"" I was all in for this movie and it did not disappoint. Intrigue and mischief abound in this tale of revenge and maybe even love. Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth have the perfect amount of chemistry and charm. The tale does take some twists and turns, one in particular that had me shouting, ""NO!"" with about 30 minutes of movie left. At that point I was concerned with where the plot was going, but they righted the ship in the end and gave the viewers a satisfying ending. The entire film is quite charming and funny. I also enjoyed the slight homage to Priscilla Queen of the Desert with the opening shot of a bus traveling through the desert and then Hugo Weaving's character with a penchant for frilly hats and smooth fabrics - genius!",The Dressmaker
23,Blue-Grotto,Spell-binding Story,10,8 November 2015,"Banished from a remote and sparsely populated Australian town when she was ten, Tilly (Kate Winslet) returns many years later. Fresh from conquering the fashion world in Paris, Tilly's form fitting red dress turns heads immediately. Some say Tilly committed a horrible crime and was cursed for it. Tilly has come in order to better learn the truth about what really happened and to set things right. There are many things on her mind including determining her own guilt in the matter, her mother Molly who appears to be mad, lifting the curse, finding love and revenge, among other things.Battle lines form. Many want Tilly to be guilty and cursed. They work to get her seen in the worst light. The haters may even include Tilly's mother Molly. Yet there are many who believe in Tilly. As she sets up a dress making shop and helps create new and better characters for people, her allies grow. The dresses she makes change how people see themselves and how others view them. It may not be Tilly who is cursed, rather it might be the town for the judgments that they heaped upon a girl.At the heart of this wonderful film is the theme of how a few awful people make life so bad for others by their terrible and swift judgments. The film is set in the 1950s and is both serious and funny. P.J. Hogan is one of the best screenwriters. His stories are complex and full of amazing twists & turns. His insight into human nature, especially female characters, is spot-on. Added to the spell-binding writing is superb acting by Kate Winslet, Hugo Weaving and the others, the always intriguing back-drop of Australia, compelling themes and characters, and superb directing and organization. Of the 32 films I saw at the Toronto International Film Festival this year, this was the best.",The Dressmaker
24,Imdbidia,Wonderful Aussie film,8,11 February 2017,"The Dressmaker is a delightful Australian movie set in the imaginary town of Dungadar, in rural Victoria, in the 1950s. Tilly, the prodigal daughter of Molly, returns home in full glamour and as high-fashion seamstress, ready to attend to her elderly mother.This is a modern classic mix of comedy and drama, with a phenomenal cast ensemble,great characters, an awesome atmosphere, and a fair dinkum just ending. The movie has very witty moments, some unforgettable scenes, interesting archetypal small-town characters, and great performances overall.This is an chorus film, and everybody is good in it, even Liam Hemsworth, whose talent is wasted in Hollywood mediocre films, is good here. However, Hugo Weaving, Judy Davis, Shane Bourne, and the British Winslet are really excellent and show how versatile and talented actors they are. Despite the age difference, Winslet & Hemsworth make a great couple and have great chemistry on camera!The production is top-notch: Awesome dresses, gorgeous make-up, wonderful rural atmosphere, artistic lighting and cinematography, and a very lovely Spanish flair in the background music. The Dressmaker is a film both about revenge and wanting to fit, about how the hardships of life can take us to better and higher places in life. It is also about the effects of bullying on children and how they pervade adulthood and can brand people for life and make their social relationships a nightmare. Finally, it is also a movie about small group dynamics, how some small groups would never accept anybody different, would punish anybody that seem not to fit, and would never open the door to anybody who belongs to the group but is an individual, unless they can use the same person for their own benefit; if you have grown within a small community, rural or not, you will recognize many group attitudes, behaviors and human characters reflected on those portrayed in the film. That was, at least, my case. The main downside of the film to me is that the story wanders unnecessarily, that the different themes aren't always organically blended, and some of the characters aren't fully understood. For example, we don't know the real background of the McSweneys, or why the schoolteacher hates Tilly so much. Also, I would have loved a bit of more background on Tilly's wanderings through Europe and what exactly takes her to her hometown. The same can be said about Molly, I wanted to know what happens to her from being fully vilified to, apparently, fully accepted or at least not molested.The fact that the movie isn't pretentious and doesn't take itself too seriously adds another layer of charm to a film that is really funny, thoughtful and a great example of what Aussies can do when they take film-making in their own country seriously.Very enjoyable!",The Dressmaker
25,cdcrb,very dark comedy set in Australia,8,25 September 2016,"macabre. dark humor. bad things happen to good and bad people. violence. that's for starters. kate is a Paris trained dressmaker, who returns to her small Aussie town to get revenge on the very folks who betrayed her many years before and sent her away. her mother is still alive, living in squalor, to say the least and she doesn't acknowledge her daughter. kate begins making dresses for the local women, a rival dressmaker is brought in as competition and things go pretty much down hill from there. all the performances are topnotch. I hardly recognized hugo weaving as the local cop. kate is really wonderful, but by this time we come to expect that. this is not a film for everyone, but if you enjoy off beat very well made movies, go see it. the director, Jocelyn moorhouse made ""proof"" a film staring hugo weaving and Russell crowe, 25 years ago.

26,bregund,A film should be airtight from beginning to end,3,19 June 2018,"One false note and the whole thing collapses. Typically, scripts are edited and re-edited until your eyes fall out, and then re-edited some more. To draw you in, everything should be plausible and believable: Believable characters, believable storylines, believable situations. This film managed to keep its balls in the air until 1/3 of the way through, when our zaftig, middle-aged heroine waddles into the middle of a rugby game and distracts the players with a cocktail dress. More than likely these men would have been puzzled by the incongruity, not smitten with desire for a woman old enough to be their aunt. Okay, one sour note in the storyline, I guess I can keep watching. Then along comes the playground scene. Tilly begs her schoolmate not to tell where she's hiding. Come on, man. This is a town of not more than thirty people in the middle of nowhere, how in the world can she expect to keep hiding indefinitely? It makes zero sense. You people who automatically rated this film ten stars just because it stars Kate Winslet should have your head examined.",The Dressmaker

Diane was attracted by the subject matter: dressmaking in rural Australia while I knew nothing about the film. To be honest making dresses took a very modest amount of time but albeit several critical scenes in a complex story. The complexity of the film rolled out fairly quickly and then seemed to me to plateau before picking up speed and then continuing along slowly before the conclusion of the film. The interweaving of the characters of this very small country town was magical to someone like me who knew nothing about the story. I unashamedly love outback movies set in small country towns during a time set somewhere between WWI and the middle of the previous century.

More a dark- not quite black- comedy. Hits a few genres. It has one of the most hand over mouth omg no! moments I've had in awhile. Kate Winslet is good as always as the flawed angsty woman though it's hard not to notice she's much older than her supposed peers. Judy Davis is a treasure and a great character actor. Liam Hemsworth has that likability factor - lots of handsome blokes in this film- but again the age difference ( 15 years) with KW is pretty strange. They're supposed to be the same age. Still very good.,The Dressmaker
29,CineMuseFilms,This is pure pastiche comedy that has no intention of taking things seriously,8,11 February 2016,"If pure entertainment is your goal, then The Dressmaker is a very funny and engaging Australian farce. However, if you want authenticity in storytelling, accuracy of period-sets, and narrative believability, you might be disappointed. It's all about expectations: the higher you set them the further you fall. But you will enjoy the film more if you recognise this piece of Aussie silliness as pastiche comedy, a genre that has no intention of taking things seriously. It's like the painter who deliberately applies layers of paint too thickly, with exaggerated colours and bold strokes that produce caricatures not characters and a story arc in crazy loops without predictability or linearity. That's why opinions differ so widely about The Dressmaker. So just accept the incongruity of Dior haute couture in an outback shanty town, the endearing closet transvestite policeman, the parody of class bitchiness between respectable townsfolk and outcasts, and the quest for vengeance using the transformative power of female fashion. None of it is serious.It could easily have been made into a great Australian film that was understood by audiences around the world. But as an incoherent Aussie mashup, with lashings of bogan humour and echoes of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), Muriel's Wedding (1994), Strictly Ballroom (1992) and many others, it has been home-grown for our enjoyment and enjoyable it certainly is. Kate Winslet is almost upstaged by Judy Davis as her mum, and Hugo Weaving trumps them both in uniform or pink taffeta. Liam Hemsworth is a bit too hipster to be believable as a 1950s farm hand, but his eye-candy value adds another visual wild-card. The star-studded cast would have enjoyed the frolic and so will any audience if the film is approached in the right way.",The Dressmaker

Touching, witty, charming, classy, dramatic, loving... and sinister.

31,luke-a-mcgowan,The Dressmaker is one of the most utterly bizarre films I've ever seen,2,28 December 2015,"What on Earth did I just watch?The Dressmaker absolutely cannot settle on a genre. When Tilly (Kate Winslett) first arrives in town, it has the taste of a Western. There's also a mystery element added regarding an incident in Tilly's past. There's a romance in there, the abundance of costumes make it feel like a period piece, a few scenes feel like a horror. Ultimately, most of the film fits firmly into the category of comedy or soap opera. Many scenes in The Dressmaker is competently made, but when they are strung together, they so horrendously clash in contrast that the whole film becomes an exercise in incredulity. Moments after a tearful scene over a main character's body, we're laughing out loud at slapstick.The acting is the film's saving grace. Kate Winslett does absolutely everything the horrendous screenplay asks of her. Her mastery of the Australian accent is impressive and she is classy, funny, dramatic and utterly gorgeous. Judy Davis is very funny in all of her scenes. Sarah Snook cements herself as an exceptional Australian talent, portraying both the ugly duckling and the upper class socialite she becomes later. A look of haughty superiority is so genuine you will scrunch up your nose at her. Hugo Weaving rips his character right out of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, but is so much fun about it that you'll forgive him for his occasional overacting. Gyton Grantley and Liam Hemsworth round out the cast and do solid jobs, even if Hemsworth still isn't what I'd call a major talent. The gowns and dresses created for the film are breathtaking and the cinematography is also splendid. The writing is utterly atrocious, again due to the banal mixing of genres. The mystery is exciting to see unravelled but is ultimately based off a character doing something so stupid and inexplicable that it defies belief. Whenever Tilly's ""curse"" is mentioned I cringe. Winslett's bizarre memory loss exists only to support the mystery. Elements about Molly not remembering Tilly contributed nothing to the film. Late in the film Hemsworth and Winslett share sappy romantic dialogue and Hemsworth is forced to drop the awful line ""It can't be Superman. He's right here."" Its a credit to him and Winslett that they were able to get through even a single take of the film.The Dressmaker is one of the most utterly bizarre films I've ever seen. It's simultaneously one of the greatest and worst movies I've ever seen. That's the same category as Tommy Wiseau's The Room. Not great company.",The Dressmaker

33,Dunham16,a classy remake of Alfred Hitchcock's SUSPICION,9,23 January 2017,"The famous 1941 movie on which it is based seems to point to Cary Grant as the serial killer without of course being recognized or apprehended in the purposely enigmatic ending. This remake is set in rural Australia around 1950. Kate Winslet and Judy Davis step out of character as the leads to shine in brilliant performances.Rural Australia as filmed has a grit and grime intended by the author which of course is never the focus of a Hitchcock movie. The premise is Kate Winslet is seen as the victim in a series of magnificently shot and edited tales each one a delight. The crazy quilt of sequences is the only reason I give it a 9 despite of course enjoying every moment. One shot is soft porn, another bully hazing, another comic relief and another further trying to make the audience guess who is the murderer",The Dressmaker
34,ferdinand1932,Fairytale,5,23 February 2016,"Anyone looking at this and expecting a mature story will be disappointed. It's a child's fairy-tale which entails all the qualities - good and bad - that that genre carries.The story is minimal and at times strains the patience with its ridiculous flashbacks and enduring plot-lines from childhood. But it's a simple retribution and justice tale and so the ordinary rules don't really apply.That freedom of judgment has to be applied to the characters too: more like overly exaggerated caricatures than realized mature characters. The absurdity of a poor rural community dressing in expensive fabrics in the dry brown landscape is another fairy-tale touch.This form and genre may exhaust the patience of some and fairly so, but taken on its own terms, which oddly are not too different from an early Dickens novel, because it approaches life and struggles in the same childish fairy story terms, this is quite amusing: quite, but not completely.It is played broad like an amateur production which is tiring.

Jocelyn Moorhouse's latest feature is enjoyable enough and so unexpected, and let's be honest she also has a great team to help her achieve that.

36,Radu_A,Any ideas why this masterpiece was snubbed at the Oscars?,9,28 February 2016,"This is hands down the best film in the English language I've seen for at least two years. Not only does it do its source absolute justice, it adds a genuine, highly original Oz visual atmosphere to its themes. The cast is nothing short of amazing, with every single character bringing the utmost of their craft to the roles. Judy Davis delivers one of the best performances of her illustrious career, but Kate Winslet, Kerry Fox and Sarah Snook are also fantastic. Liam Hemsworth isn't just hotter than Chris, he's also the far more nuanced thespian. Hugo Weaving, one of the best actors of his generation, sinks his teeth into his beefy part of an exceedingly well-mannered cop in the 1950's Oz outback.Winslet is the mysterious stranger arriving by night whom he delivers her luggage to in the beginning of the film. He quickly recognizes her as the girl he sent away following the death of a boy her age 25 years earlier. The townsfolk, including her quick-tempered mother played by Davis, alternate between suspicion of the motives of her return and attraction for her stunning dressmaking skills and resolute character.Some people will find the meandering story, which constantly shifts between mystery, comedy, tragedy and romance hard to follow. It's their own fault. Everyone else will highly appreciate the original story, the excellent camera work and set design, the abundance of love shown in every frame for a project that took 15 years to realize. Its domestic success as the 2nd most successful film of 2015 after you-know-which-one could not be more deserved.One can therefore only wonder why the Adacemy snubbed this for the Oscars, especially if you look at the usual suspects which represent the contenders this year. And as justified as the #OscarsSoWhite debate is, this omission also reminds us of another group of movie artists which are all too often absent from the list of nominees: Women. For what makes ""The Dressmaker"" so highly enjoyable on top of its original story, local feel and excellent cast, is that it offers a feminine angle of storytelling which we do not get to see enough.",The Dressmaker
37,eyeintrees,"Unusual, surprising, conflicting and enjoyable.",10,25 December 2016,"I avoided this movie, even when friends were telling me to see it. I was terrified that it would be one of those ghastly, badly acted Australian movies that reek of cliché and wooden acting; a mix of bad 6pm soapie with a script for the comatose.Almost immediately, I was taken by surprise. Stunned that Kate Winslet had the Aussie accent so superbly nailed, I had to keep watching. Utterly delighted that Huge Weaving was not only his usual consummate superb acting self, but hilarious and moving.Judy Davis - what can I say... so darned good in her role as the mother - that woman is a force to be reckoned with, whether hilarious, as she was here, or otherwise.I read in another review that all the other actors where caricatures, and in a sense that's a bit correct... but it worked for this movie, because to have them otherwise would have turned it into bad soap opera and serious boredom, whereas the way they were portrayed gave them the lack of importance that they all deserved, although all of the actors were just wonderful in their roles.The twists and turns were on occasion a shock to the system, one occasion in particular, leaving me stunned. But it's important to understand that this is a quirky work from beginning to its very satisfying ending.I loved this movie. And for all those having a bitchfest about Kate Winslet 'showing her age'... get serious, and who cares... she was marvellous, and I was not a particular fan of her prior; but I certainly am now.Gloriously photographed, fantastically dressed!

38,ReganRebecca,A real Australian film,8,4 January 2017,"There's nothing quite like Australian films. Though they're all quite different there is a certain type of film, with quirky surreal elements and an easy mix of comedy and tragedy that always seems distinctly Australian to me. The Dressmaker fits within that category. The film focuses on Tilly, (Kate Winslet, sounding to my ear like a true Australian, but I'm sure those who know better will correct me if I'm wrong), returning to Dungatar, the place of her birth, in order to tend to her sick, alcoholic mother Molly (Judy Davis). The last time Tilly was in town she was ten years old, considered the joke of the town because her mother was unwed at the time she had her and her parentage was unknown, and was being escorted away because she had been accused of murdering Stewart Pettyman, the beloved son of the sinister councillor Pettyman. Many years have passed since then and Tilly is now an accomplished seamstress and designer, looking to gain answers into whether she really killed Stewart or nor (she blocked the traumatic incident from her memory).The thing to understand about the film is that it's really a comedy-tragedy western, only instead of a shotgun our heroine wields a sewing machine, using her creations to aid or sabotage as the case may be. Winslet and Davis are great here as a mother daughter pairing. Liam Hemsworth shows up as Tilly's dreamy childhood playmate who is more interested in her than ever now that they're both adults. The real star of course is the fashion which is absolutely spectacular. Just tons of beautiful outfits and Winslet has a dream body for those gorgeous 50s silhouettes which celebrate her hourglass figure. A wonderful return to form after a long absence from directing by Jocelyn Moorhouse. I can only hope that it isn't too long before she's back in the director's chair.",The Dressmaker
39,bogus-bogus-one,Inconsistently fun,7,29 February 2016,"As some other reviewers, I would describe ""The Dressmaker"" as a mostly fun fairy tale. I only wish our filmmakers could have maintained a little more consistency. The film included several awkward transitions and just seemed to wander off track throughout. I don't know if these little breakdowns were due to the writing, editing or both. The actors were basically caricatures and I was able to forgave the majority of over the top acting. The exaggerated behavior, circumstances and great visuals didn't always contribute or fit into the overall story. I got the feeling the director just fell in love with a few individual scenes and just had to be wedged in.

Liam Hemsworth as Teddy is handsome and a polite gentleman. The movie did not have any strong points. I hope this movie is not nominated in any category. 1 hr and 59 minutes of poor editing, mediocre direction and boring script. The only redeeming features of the movie are Kate Winslet's pretty face and Liam Hemsworth boyish looks. Kate Winslet was awesome in Revolutionary road, Steve Jobs and many other movies.

You can pick holes in the story like moths on a blanket - too many to mention.In some ways, it reminds me of Waking Ned Devine - a small town full of bizarre characters (set in Australia).

43,jasontheterrible,Wish I had Seen it on the Big Screen,9,10 December 2017,"When great care is taken with the cinematography and lighting, I want the big screen experience, but I avoided this film because the material did not grab me. It is immediately obvious they are using real film and that is rare, but what a treat! If one review had described the metamorphoses of the female forms and faces, I would have been there on opening night. That is no longer politically correct. The dress maker transforms rural hounds into breathtaking beauties with sexy dresses and super-hot make up. This happens in a backwards, rural town setting with a 1940's time flavor when glamour and man chasing was openly sanctioned. The story is good but the characters are the most fascinating bunch assembled in a long time and well played by all. Most will especially enjoy Winslet and Davis but all are good. The scoring is also great. See it for the sexual tension, raw beauty and love lessons.",The Dressmaker
44,ElliesWonder,exaggerating ugly,5,22 July 2017,"I want to watch a movie with logical epitases, and obviously, this movie goes so far. Over exaggeration and black humor, it is impractical, makes no sense to me, difficult for audiences to put themselves into character's shoes. All I can see are only lacking logic, pathological characters, and exaggerated crimes and vanities. I believe everything should happen for a reason, I can't see a good purpose from this work. No idea why would someone making such a fuss about an imaginary illness. Maximumly zoom and disclose the dark side of humanity? However according to statistics, and the law of averages, I believe good and bad are equal, mostly good take more advantage because many people like to act well. So the movie is isolated from the reality.Besides, who gives the dressmaker the right to judge and punish people? Who she thinks she is? An escaped criminal arsonist, no wonder she has troubled records.Lastly, stay away from someone you don't like, there is no need to go back to them.",The Dressmaker
45,verna-a,Over-the-top to the point of silliness,4,25 June 2016,"It's hard to call this movie a success although it starts off well. Basically it's overdone in most respects, can't settle on a mood or theme, and is bedevilled by hammy actors who clearly think this is their big chance to make an impact. Their parts should have been red-pencilled out or clipped onto the cutting-room floor. Kate Winslet acts her way smoothly through this as though she wasn't surrounded by a lot of substandard stuff going on. She is really getting a bit old for roles like this, however. Hugo Weaving shows his experience by taking a low-key approach to his otherwise potentially hammy role. Liam Hemsworth (""the Torso"") looks relaxed and mildly amused by what he finds himself in. I don't care for Judy Davis in this, as the character clearly invites her to ham it up and she does. As it's some time since I read the book, I can't say what the true mood of the story should be, but I'm sure a more restrained and consistent treatment of it would make it appear more adult and less childish. Just about everything in the film could have been improved by more subtlety and a surer touch. As it is the story and the minor characters become more and more bizarre and as a result I'd almost completely lost interest by the end credits. I can't believe it's only 118 minutes, as it seemed at least 45 minutes too long.",The Dressmaker

However, that was today's mystery movie for the monthly Camera Cinema Club in San Jose. If you'd told me that Kate Winslet could play the Clint Eastwood role in ""High Plains Drifter"" and that the movie would be reset to nowhere, Australia in 1951, I'd have said that would be an unlikely formula for a hit movie. I'm here to tell you that this is an exceptional and unusual movie with links to many outstanding films of the past, yet unique unto itself. Winslet has never been better in my opinion in this strong role and she's supported by a great cast with knockout performances especially by Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. This movie is filled with quirky characters sure to tickle your interest and funny bone. Yet it's not an all-out comedy. There's a serious amount of serious and a fair amount of tragedy. If you like your movies cut from a different cloth, ""The Dressmaker"" belongs on your must-see list.",The Dressmaker
48,ablack90,Such a fun film,9,4 December 2020,This film is a one part whimsical and two parts dark humour tale. The cast of characters are all excellent but Judy Davis as the eccentric mother really shines. Kate Winslet plays a fancy dressmaker who returns to her roots in Dungatar Australia in the hopes of answering some questions. The plain town folks soon find themselves calling on the dressmaker to liven their wardrobes. Their need for fashion trumps the fact the whole town blamed her as a child for the death of a boy.

The people, the setting, the behaviors all were just unsettling and depressing.We were watching on Amazon and wanted to check the length of time left.

It is a masterpiece with a wonderfully original screenplay, cinematography and direction - I've never seen anything quite like it. It feels like a cross between a Wes Anderson film and a Baz Luhrmann film, but toned down slightly. And then set in a forgotten era in a tiny outback town of Australia. But that hardly describes it. It is a unique, fresh, brand new slice of cinema that satisfies a craving you didn't you know you had!

But Liam was a wrong choice to play his role because he seemed too ypung to talk about 25 years ago because he is already 25!! I give importance to these details too much in a film.

52,mailes22,Amusing for the first 90 minutes,6,8 November 2015,"Kate Winslet and Judy Davis steal the whole movie. Liam Hemsworth is very nice on the eye. Everyone else is a caricature.The movie was surprisingly humorous for the first 90 minutes. Not all the one liners are in the trailer after all. But then the plot takes a dark turn and really loses its way. The book probably took its time to get all the characters to the end, but the last part of the movie feels rushed and really rather silly, in a slapstick kind of way. First the townsfolk hate Tilly then they love her, then they hate her, then they're back pleading with her to make costumes to save the town's pride ... Honestly, I felt like I was getting whiplash trying to keep up with it.The other distracting aspect is that Kate Winslet is looking her age and while she's still fabulous, Liam Hemsworth is 15 years younger than she is in real life, and it's just not remotely believable that they were children of a similar age growing up together. Winslet was probably wearing her first makeup and heels, the day Hemsworth was born.On the plus side, Winslet gives a flawless performance, including the Aussie accent, which is notoriously difficult to pull off convincingly. Meryl Strep's dreadful attempt at an Aussie accent in Evil Angels just proved how hard it is to do. All credit to Winslet. And it was fabulous seeing Judy Davis on the screen again. The fight between the two of them before the bath scene was hilarious.",The Dressmaker
53,manders_steve,"An effortlessly entertaining character based film, with unpredictable quirkiness",8,31 October 2015,"If you like quirky, character based films bridging the drama, thriller and rom-com genres, this will suit. And if you like condensed laconic Australian dialogue without lots of non essential words even better. Kate Winslet leads a large cast of mostly locally well known and competent Australian actors from film and stage. I had to check that she really was British, her accent is so good. The tight writing and unexpected twists and turns in plot, from a book by Rosalie Ham led to an effortless two hours of entertainment.Kate Winslet carries the emotional traumas of Myrtle / Tilly Dunnage returning to a tiny Australian country town she had left in uncertain circumstances years earlier, and Hugo Weaving as the police sergeant inhabited the conflicts of being the only police officer in a remote community. The transformation in Sarah Snook as Gertrude / Trudy Pratt was a marvel to behold. But Judy Davis made the most of enormous opportunities, and attracted the limelight to Molly Dunnage, Myrtle's mentally unstable mother throughout.The locations and cinematography really rang true, with the setting appearing to be the dry farmland with granite boulders on low hills between Melbourne and Geelong. I'm not quite old enough to recall the era, but the style and artefacts highlighted seemed convincing.I found this a really interesting film, with strong, unpredictable plot and well-drawn characters I could believe in and feel for.Give it a go!",The Dressmaker

'The Dressmaker' is charming enough and well acted (Sarah Snook steals a scene or two) but Kate Winslet's performance is as beige and dry as the outback fictional town the movie takes place in. Winslet's gift is her ability to fill even the most pedantic of characters with an oozing creamy ribald sensuality. Yet, there is little if any chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis are left to do the heavy lifting which they do admirably. A box office success when first released in Australia which begs the question: What do I know? Well, I know there is something missing. Maybe Hugh Grant? (I'd say ""or a Hugh Grant type"" but there isn't such a thing. We miss ya', Hugh.) The drama seems confined and forced almost as if the story would have been better suited as a metatheatre play. The result is just an okay little movie.",The Dressmaker

58,Sweet_Ophelia,A little Aussie marvel,10,5 November 2015,"Today I had the absolute pleasure of seeing a film I've been waiting about a decade for. 'The Dressmaker' is adapted from Rosalie Ham's bestselling Australian book which first came out in 2000, and I studied in high school about that long ago too. Ms Ham actually came and spoke at my school, and I can still remember her telling us that she was currently writing a screenplay of the book – but that she wasn't sure if the American production company would want the movie to be set in Australia or adapted to the bible-belt/deep south of America.Well. It's the year 2015 and 'The Dressmaker' is here – and it's spectacular and spectacularly Aussie. Indeed, I couldn't have pictured a film adaptation that took the Australia out of this country-Gothic dark comedy tale, and watching the film (shot around Victoria in Horsham, Little River and Yarraville) I got tingles when I saw the town of Dungatar on the screen – bought so precisely to life. The lonely white gum trees and rocky-red dust bowl look, the rusted tin-roofs and sagging clapboard buildings. The distinctly Australian setting becomes a character unto itself, and a stark background to Tilly Dunnage's unfolding tale of style and secrets I absolutely loved the book when I studied it in school, and I'm thrilled to report that the film is equally fantastic and one of the best adaptations I've seen. Kate Winslet is Tilly who returns home to look after her ailing mother (and town outcast) ""mad"" Molly  but she's also returned home to discover the truth of why she was sent away as a child. The town of Dungatar is sure that Tilly murdered a boy, and Tilly is half-convinced of the rumor too, and sure it's why she's now cursed. But she also knows that Dungatar never had any love for her and Molly growing up, and if she wants to get close to the truth she'll have to use everything in her arsenal to pry it out of them. Tilly's arsenal happens to be fashion. Haute-couture, to be more precise. Since running away from a Melbourne boarding school as a girl, she traveled from London to Milan and Paris, studying under the greats (Balenciaga!) and when she returns to Dungatar she's a veritable fashion powerhouse – using her Singer sewing machine to create Dior-inspired and Tilly-originals to coax the vile women of Dungatar into a false sense of individuality and specialness The cast in this film is fantastic. Kate Winslet and Judy Davis clearly have a ball playing contentious mother/daughter pair Tilly and Molly, and there's a beautiful balance of the absurd and heartbreaking between them. Liam Hemsworth as one of the few kind Dungatar townspeople who pursues Tilly romantically, despite her dire warnings of a curse, is at his charming best here – the role of Teddy McSwiney isn't much of a stretch for him, but it's lovely to see and hear a Hemsworth in a little Aussie role that suits him to a tee (and, look, at school my fellow classmates were dead-set on the likes of Beau Brady from 'Home and Away' playing Teddy so – Liam's wonderful!).The film is choc-a-block with Aussie stars playing dastardly villains or defeated characters in the town of Dungatar – Shane Jacobson, Barry Otto, Shane Bourne and Alison Whyte among them. Some of these minor roles clearly got a bit jumbled in the editing; there's a wayward flirtation between Rebecca Gibney and a shop-keep that just sort of goes nowhere  but then there's Hugo Weaving as the kindly cross-dressing Sergeant Farrat, making up for mistakes in the past by befriending Tilly and coming to her and Molly's defense – Weaving shines in the role and clearly had a ball.Another stand-out was Sarah Snook as Gertrude 'Trudy' Pratt, an old classmate of Tilly's who becomes one of her main clotheshorses. Snook is in everything at the moment (coming off 'The Secret River' adaptation, now in 'The Beautiful Lie') and she's just wonderful. In this film when the clothes are also characters as much as the setting, Snook is breathtaking in Tilly's Dior and Balenciaga. The film is set in the 1950s so it's vintage Dior and Balenciaga, darling – everyone looks like a Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn throwback, and it especially suits Snook with her luminous, luminous skin and enviable hourglass figure.Kate Winslet is truly superb – of course she nails the accent, that's one of her great strengths (remember 1994's 'Heavenly Creatures'?) – and she's absolutely stunning in all of the vintage couture. But she really does justice to Tilly, a complex and fragile character beneath all those breathtaking outfits like suits of armor.I t was great fun to see this story I've long loved come to life. Director Jocelyn Moorhouse has made a sumptuous film that frames the stark town of Dungatar as beautifully as she does the actresses swanning in the stunning gowns. The adaptation is one of the best I've ever seen, but then again Rosalie Ham had some great material on offer in her country-Gothic tale of ball gowns and small-town brutality. I couldn't believe how hard I cried in some parts, even as I vividly remembered having the wind knocked out of me when I first read the twists and turns in Ham's book all those years ago  'The Dressmaker' is a little Aussie marvel.",The Dressmaker
59,lbenot,The Messmaker,1,8 October 2016,"While the plot and storytelling probably flowed and entertained while reading the book, it doesn't while watching this movie. It tried, but what you'll spend 2 hours watching is a strange, surrealistic, and downright goofy tale told in a very clunky, forced manner: A dressmaker, armed with her Singer sewing machine, returns to the town she's from in order to use her ""dressmaking skills"" (?) to get ""revenge"" (??) against everyone for having wrongly banished her from the town for a childhood crime she could not remember and did not commit. (???)The central mother/daughter and protagonist/love-interest relationships are just as wooden, clunky, and forced.

There is the the talented dressmaker(hairdresser) ostracised by the local community of gossips and 1950s dressed women. Considered dangerous or even murderous, living in the strange house at the top of the hill. Okay they add some subplots but seriously, guys, 0/10 for originality.

65,organicsocial,Having To Seek Revenge Itself Is A Curse,8,25 August 2016,"What is it to be cursed? To be born in unfortunate circumstances, growing up in an abusive environment, failing to trust anyone in life. All these recipes of a cursed life are there in this movie. In this story you'll find the crooked, the manipulative and the kind - all living together in a town that is so God forsaken and utterly unimportant that no one cares if its literally named 'Dungatar'. As life progresses slowly in such places, bigotry is often a part and parcel. Social elite with all the power and connections go unpunished while they exploit the common folk for their weakness. Sounds pretty universal. Also, the women are particularly made to suffer more than the men. It is a hopeless situation but sometimes they exact revenge. Kate Winslet depicts it so elegantly as she returns to her childhood tormentors. Her travails have transformed her into the proverbial ""vamp"". She is armed with her looks, her thirst for revenge and... a skill that makes her the perfect femme fatale. The Dressmaker is more than a typical revenge story. It is a good revenge story! When tortured people use their pain for creativity, the result is mesmerizing. Their craft becomes their most powerful weapon. They don't need to use guns or physical violence to prove a point. That's the brightest part about this dark comedy. It gives hope to the viewer that some sacrifices are worth making. Although, revenge is an emotion that burns both the wrongdoer and the wronged, forgiveness is just not an option sometimes. Neither is running away. Not at least in fiction. Bad people will do bad things and even with all your efforts to set things right you can't escape it. This movie brings in a tragedy just in time to remind the viewer of that fact. Social behavior of humans is driven by deception. The Dressmaker points to the hypocrisy and manufactured perceptions that decide the social status of people. Insecure folks move in packs. They denigrate and ridicule others behind their backs. The guilty ones hide behind misinformation as they fuel rumors to avoid being pointed out. Individuals who don't manipulate are pushed down. Efforts to overcome such curses leads to unexpected casualties. Unfortunate, but educational. On a side note, this movie vaguely reminds of Edward Scissorhands especially with the location of the protagonist's house on top of a hill and the way the townspeople go about doing their day-to-day politics.The Dressmaker is a very women centric drama that never once tries to shove feminism down the throat. Men are both good and bad just like women are both enlightened and ignorant. There are selfish and there are martyrs. The worst are those who justify their wrongs through their bigoted worldview. Even if you manage to burn down the whole place for revenge... it is only bittersweet at best. Watch this movie for the performances of Kate Winslet, Hugo Weaving and Judy Davis. If you've watched Predestination then Sarah Snook's short role will further impress you.",The Dressmaker
66,david-rector-85092,A crazily woven tale that breaks the mould of genre.,9,6 October 2015,"This film will divide audiences and critics (as it already has; especially American and British ones), so it will be interesting to see whether it finds a market here in Australia. 'The Dressmaker' is the long awaited directorial return of Jocelyn Moorhouse. After 'Proof' was a major critical success in 1991, American features followed, but this is the first for Ms Moorhouse in nearly 2 decades. There is an audacious feel to this movie from start to finish and for me, an unexpected one. From the movie poster, this would seem like a period costume drama; well it is certainly set in a bygone era, and there is a panoply of amazing costumes, but this film is impossible to squeeze into a genre; making it a challenge to describe nor summarize.As I write this review, the film has not yet opened nationwide in Australia; but if the preview audience I attended was any indication, this film will be enjoyed by local filmgoers, but will it find a mainstream audience? I somehow doubt it. It is anarchic; indulgent, broad, implausible and loads of fun!! I enjoyed most of its 2 hour running time; but the final quarter did feel clumsy with a little too much plot shoehorned in; giving it a chaotic and lurching quality. Early on I sat wondering how this movie will fit into the already idiosyncratic reputation that Aussie films have; both at home and on the world screens. 'The Dressmaker' is ultimately going to be its own genre. As an adaptation from the novel of the same name; there are so many characters to depict and follow; and part of the chaos was the litany of quirkily filmed sequences with a who's who of local talent. This is easily the best cast ever assembled for an Australian feature; from stand up comedians to TV icons, to stage and screen legends; and new talent. Perhaps it will be the star lineup that will lure filmgoers into the cinema for this movie. Judy Davis, one of our most celebrated actors, virtually steals the movie from the British import, the amazing Kate Winslet. Davis is in top form here, showing a screwball comedic side; rarely seen in her stellar career thus far; perhaps only glimpsed in the Woody Allen films she has appeared in. With the blackened teeth; the haggard make up and hobo costuming, Judy is a riot as the mother to the story's protagonist. If Ms Davis doesn't get the AACTA for Supporting Actress, I'll be very surprised. And if the movie gets the right marketing, perhaps that elusive Oscar for one of the great unrewarded screen stars. The teaming of Judy with Kate Winslet works well; there are some riotous moments and tender ones too; which give the film not only respite from the breakneck speed but some gravitas. Liam Hemsworth is suitably the movie matinée idol; with his piercing blue eyes, his tall, muscular frame and that true blue Aussie drawl. Sarah Snook shows once again why she is the lady in waiting for the big time, and is racking up an impressive list of screen credits. There are so many great actors here: Sacha Horler, Barry Otto, Julia Blake, Genevieve Lemon, Rebecca Gibney, literally just naming a few, and perhaps best of all, a cross dressing Hugo Weaving, showing that there is nothing this great actor cannot play, and play admirably.The film is beautifully filmed and designed, and the strange world of this quaint little town in the middle of nowhere is perfectly captured and lovingly presented. So what are the criticisms? I was fine with the morphing of black comedy, western, revenge, love story motifs and styles; but I struggled a little with the matching of Kate Winslet, who at nearly 40 is way too old to have been a contemporary of the characters played here by Snook, Hemsworth et al. Winslet is nearer the age of the actors playing the parents of her and her contemporaries - Alison Whyte and Rebecca Gibney. As gorgeous and brilliant in the role as she is, it does seem as if the film, which was possibly funded and built around Winslet, has forgotten about this age difference. At 25, Liam Hemsworth, and Sarah Snook at 27 simply don't look right in the context of the main characters return after 20 years. That said, i mostly ignored this, and just enjoyed this caper movie for what it is.In reading reviews of the movie from overseas, and seeing the vitriol targeting the movie's 'mish mash' and 'mess', I reflected on which other films or filmmakers 'The Dressmaker' was reminiscent of. Wes Anderson's 'Grand Budapest Hotel' sprung to mind as well as the work of Joel and Ethan Coen and Quentin Tarantino. All of these storytellers dabble in an array of genres, rendering them difficult to categorize, whilst still engendering praise and an audience. Anderson's recent multi Oscar win, had a glorious cast, a beautiful design, and a similarly caper like quality: at times just silly, but handsome to watch and enjoyable in the moment, and arty for sure, but hardly earth shattering or deep and meaningful. I hope that Australian critics and audiences alike get behind 'The Dressmaker' as it is a caper movie; I don't think it believes it is making a weighty, earnest Oscar bait movie, but a roller-coaster of a cinematic kind; funny, biting, gauche, heightened,tense and raucuous; and at the end of the day, very very entertaining.",The Dressmaker

The majority of the characters were downright evil. I can't understand anyone writing such a story nor producing it into a movie. Kate Winslet was brilliant as usual and it was certainly a treat to view eye candy Hemsworth almost nude but other than that, I did not enjoy it. But the fashions she produced were fabulous as was the transformation of one of the young ladies; that was truly inspirational. The stark setting, although realistic, was boring as was the deprivation of most of the townspeople.The need for dental work alone in many characters was deplorable.

I love Kate Winslet, and her character suits her like Tilly's dresses. Molly and the police officer are absolutely great as well.

Her second feature PROOF is a modern masterpiece and this 2015 adaptation of a Rosalie Ham novel isn't far off that.This is probably Kate Winslet's finest hour thus far, playing the 'maybe' murderess Myrtle Dunnage, who returns to her vipers nest of a home town having reinvented herself as a purveyor of fine haute couture. Her return to the outback town of Dungatar is built upon the idea of exacting revenge upon a small population that wronged her and her mother (played with gleeful mania by an almost unrecognisable Judy Davis). The film opens like a Spaghetti western, and for good reason, for this is a jet black comedy modelled on HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER. Moorhouse has always had a blackly comic sensibility and fundamental affinity for the outsider. She is also that rarest of directors who is able to take risky tonal shifts in her stride. In THE DRESSMAKER things jump from the comic to the grotesque to the romantic to the tragic with all of the alacrity, poise and wit of a Preston Sturges or Rouben Mamoulian. The comedy is hilarious and the drama gut-wrenchingly harsh. Perhaps my only complaint with this slab of Australian weird cinema is that it has to end.",The Dressmaker
71,myignisrules,The trailer is misleading but the movie is worth watching,7,19 April 2016,"This trailer is a PERFECT example, of how misleading these things can be. What you see, is a romantic love story with comedic elements. A rom-com if you will. The Dressmaker is SO MUCH MORE than just that. As a matter of fact, it's nothing of the sort! This movie is more a dark comedy with romance and heavy drama thrown in. The acting by everyone involved is really spot on, with Liam Hemsworth surprising me the most. His portrayal of Teddy, made him seem much more mature/older than he usually is in movies, which in this case is very good thing. Kate Winslet hits all the right emotional notes as Tilly, a woman searching for answers about her past, but also fearful of her future, believing she isn't deserving of happiness. My only complaint would be the tone of this movie VASTLY shifts, from Act 2 to 3. Something major happens and without spoiling anything, it's so jarring that it made it hard for me to enjoy the rest of the story. It's not that it's bad story telling, it just caught me off guard and made me wish thing could've turned out different. I won't go into to much detail (all the non-readers out there will get bored), other than to praise the Directing, Writing and Visual beauty of The Dressmaker. A movie very much worth watching",The Dressmaker
72,gtyoshida,An Oscar Worthy Performance,8,5 April 2017,"Kate Winslet (Tilly Dunnage) gives an Oscar worthy performance in this fascinating tale about a dressmaker who returns to her barren hometown ostensibly to look after her ailing mother. Judy Davis and Liam Hemsworth also give commendable performances, adding worth to an already rich story line; Davis (Molly Dunnage) as the old, sick mother who can still teach her professional dressmaker how to sew and Hemsworth (Teddy McSwiney) the handsome athlete who schools the beautiful seamstress on the importance of a rugby game to her ""pile of nothing"" hometown. Give full credit to the actors, especially Ms. Winslet, but the backbone of this movie is the novel written by Rosalie Ham. A solid 8 out of 10.",The Dressmaker
73,elle_kittyca,"An okay attempt at Cohen brothers meets ""Steel Magnolias,"" good themes though",6,9 April 2016,"my reviews are designed to be short and sweet and without much attention to literary style...people can feel free to take them or leave them, as I know I am not an exceptional writer, but I know what I like. In my opinion, this movie could not decide if it wanted to be a weighty drama that considered important issues, or a light and playful movie like ""Oh brother, where art tho?,"" or Django Unchained. While some movies are capable of combining the two, I like a consistent reality and tone in a movie, and for me, this movie did not successfully achieve that. If you are less demanding of a movie in terms of expecting a certain consistent atmosphere, you might like it more than I did. But for me, it was like a serious drama filled with interjections of playfulness that did not quite work. These scenes were always signaled by music reminiscent of Django unchained or Kill Bill. This seemed really contrived to me, where they were signalling the time for comic relief and levity, even though it did not fit organically with the story. It seemed like the directors were using a formula designed to emulate those types of films, even though it was not suitable. The petty rivalries in the town are treated like comic fodder in such a way that they seemed inconsistent with the drama that I was trying to be engaged in. The second half of the movie works for me better than the first half, as the more serious aspects of the drama come into focus. There is an examination of prejudice, justice and personal transformation that at times is substantive. The merits of this film, in my opinion, lie in its attempt to look at those more substantial issues such as bias and personal tenacity. However, I like a movie that creates a tone and reality that holds together in a way that this did not. This reminds me of other movies, such as Mr. Nobody, where I enjoy some of the philosophical themes, but found the plot wandering and too torturous for me really to enjoy it much.",The Dressmaker
74,brendandevere,An Australian Classic.,8,29 October 2015,"'The Dressmaker' is not the type of film that instantly attracts me to the cinema. It's the wrong genre, (although this movie is difficult to place) the wrong story and it creates the wrong type of atmosphere. Leave this to the women and go and see something a little more.......you. How wrong I was and how glad I am to have jumped out of my comfort zone. It was a good excuse to take my good old mum and treat her to a midday-midweek viewing and some company with her first born or that is what I told myself when I entered the theatre only to find it filled with women and retirees excited to be out and about without the frightening hording masses that congregate on weekends.'The Dressmaker' has been dubbed as the long awaited return of Director Jocelyn Moorhouse to the chair since 1997 and she has delivered a film that will be remembered for some outstanding performances from Judy Davis, Hugo Weaving and Kate Winslet. I agree with the statement that this film doesn't fit into any particular mold but this peculiar inconsistency is what keeps the audience fixated on the screen. Just when you think that the story is heading down a certain path it quickly turns sideways, takes a detour before arriving at its intended destination. Some viewers may find this lack of direction annoying and even film destroying but I think this could be a little over dramatic.'The Dressmaker' holds a certain charm that never leaves it as it sways back and forth from one type of genre to the next. It can be billed as a 'black comedy' but it does allow the audience to experience an array of emotions. At times you will be laughing at the antics on screen and at other times you will be gripped by the drama unfolding.Based on the novel of the same name by Rosalie Ham, 'The Dressmaker' centres around Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) and her chaotic return to a small Australian country town in rural Victoria in 1951. Tilly's tumultuous departure years before were under controversial circumstances and the small rural community have not forgotten. She is everything the town isn't - sophisticated, stylish, experienced and worldly and she has come back for one reason......to reek havoc on those that callously betrayed her all those years ago.Kate Winslet rarely puts in a bad showing and her turn as Tilly Dunnage is made even more exceptional with a flawless Australian accent. The audience will forget that she is English as she seamlessly slides into the fabric of her surroundings, not once slipping up when delivering her dialogue. Judy Davis is the star of the show as Tilly's mad mother, Molly Dunnage. Davis effortlessly steals every scene she is in with outstanding engagement with a character that is a little bit off centre. Judy will be recognised for this performance with an AACTA and it will be thoroughly deserved.Hugo Weaving adds his superb presence as the cross dressing cop, Sergeant Farrat. His character grows on the audience with eccentric colourful manner, bringing the best out in Weaving that gives this wonderful film an extra element of charm. Liam Hemsworth provides the eye candy for the ladies in a solid role as Teddy McSwiney. Both Davis and Winslet are caught hot under the collar on numerous occasions. He is the stereo-typical tall, blue-eyed, rugged country boy who is the proverbial apple in his mother's eye and does exactly what Moorhouse hired him to do......stand there and look pretty. Good onya Liam.Joining the familiar talent is a who's who of Australian television that many international audiences won't recognise but they do give the film a more authentic Aussie flavour. Could this be the breakout role for Sarah Snook? Her character Gertrude Pratt is totally transformed by Tilly Dunnage only to treat the outsider with disdain when 'theories' are whispered throughout the town.I cannot see any reason why this film won't be enjoyed by the masses. It is Australian and its dry wit may not appeal to foreign markets which is a shame. The narrative is all over the place but don't let this put you off. Dig a little deeper and you will be rewarded with some brilliant performances.",The Dressmaker

79,pensive_englishman,A surprisingly good Australian film than many others,7,3 April 2021,"To be honest I wasn't quite sure if this is the kind of film I would like to watch as Australian films are largely second rate or even third rate compared to their American or British counterparts. Part of the reason I did choose to watch is the A-lister cast such as Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth.And I'm glad I made it to the end. Hilarious, ironic, surprising yet revealing are probably the most summarizing words I can use to describe this show.The storyline seems a bit flat at the beginning. Yet it starts to unfold as the show goes on. An apparently innocent girl was sent to exile for an alleged murder she has never committed only as a result of personal persecution by her birth father and various people who care only about their own jobs and who dare not speak out. The girl made a return to the town in her adulthood trying to win the heart and mind of the locals. Yet this is how the irony unfolds. People are all animals of stereotypes and once they make a judgment it's very hard to reverse that course. Unrelenting and ungrateful, isn't that we all are?There are many hilarious scenes in the show such as Gertrude running away from her initial dressmaker reminiscing of the Runaway Bride (1999), the melodramatic drowning of the chemist and the cross dressing sergeant. All add up to the spices of its comedy genre.One thing I must point out is that the surprising scenes and endings such as the sudden death of Teddy (Liam Hemsworth). I was expecting the pair would happily marry and settle for life after some courtship and romance. But I guess surprise is one of the many things movies rely on. And the burning down of Tilly's own house and the entire town thereafter comes as a total surprise to me as I would have thought the townspeople had moved on from their past wrongs. Oh well, nothing is impossible when it comes to movies, is it?Overall this film reveals the sarcastic human nature as I have summarized. And yet all the larger-than-life aspects of a film would never be accomplished without accomplished actors without whom the movie would look like a dry Valencia orange without juice. Hollywood juggernauts like Kate Winslet, Liam Hemsworth and Hugo Weaving together with Australian queen of the silver screen Judy Davies undoubtedly added a fair bit of additive on the plate. Winslet is so British and classy in Titanic (1997) and she obviously carried that on to this movie as a fashion designer. Liam Hemsworth is strikingly masculine and handsome just as his older brother Chris Hemsworth. What a seasoned movie family! And Hugo Weaving proves he can do more than Lord of the Rings and Matrix. Noteworthy is the local Australian actress Judy Davies. She clearly performed the volatile and at times morbid character as Tilly's mother very vividly.One last thing as I always review a show is its location. It is filmed in the outback of country Victoria with red rocks and bone dry earth which creates a very stark contrast to the seaside harbor city of Sydney where I live. It is such a beautiful visual shock.All in all The Dressmaker (2015) is a standout from its many mediocre or even inferior Australian peers. Well done team!",The Dressmaker
80,gloriahur,"Beautiful, Bittersweet Revenge",8,26 November 2016,"This film shows the power of beauty, strength, and grudge. The main character of the movie, Tilly Dunnage, is a beautiful young woman with a strong will to find out what had ruined her childhood and to take revenge. She is strong and independent, shown through the specific ways that she uses to take revenge, from the beginning till the end, using her skills as a dressmaker.Although Tilly ultimately succeeds in taking revenge on the people of the small town, the revenge isn't exactly ""sweet"". She is now alone- still independent and strong, at best. She seemed like a strong character from the beginning, leaving a strong impression on the town people with her dresses, but later on, we can see how she was only a little girl when she had to be strong. The traumatic experiences that she had as a child had caused her to be like that. But the weak part of her character, that she is still struggling with the memories, is later revealed to her closest people, her mom and Teddy, who embraces all of her and loves her. She hesitates on teddy's suggestion of just moving on and leaving the town together, which causes her to lose him, in exchange of allowing her to taker her revenge. The ending makes me question about what she really wanted and whether she is happy now or not. I would think probably not- she lost her most and only loved ones, her mom and Teddy, and she lost her childhood (which could be a good thing for her). But one thing for sure is that until the end, she stays beautiful, strong, and elegant.The casting was nearly perfect, since Kate Winslet is truly beautiful and elegant, and none of the acting of the characters were disturbing. Dresses and other props and settings of the scenes go well together also, creating an integrated themed film-work. Although all the places that the scenes take place is only in a small town, and only a few places in that small town, this actually makes story-line and the viewer's attention focused. One thing that I found strange in the story was how Teddy died- it was quite sudden and odd. The humorous aspects of the movie also adds to it, making the intense emotions and development of the story less heavy or boring. It also makes the mood quite cynical, eliminating elements of romance, passion, or anything too emotional before it gets in the way of her revenge. Her revenge stays complete, powerful, and beautiful.",The Dressmaker

82,timmyminh,"""You've never met the rubbish""",8,30 June 2020,"Every now and again I come back to watch this picture, it's very personal and relatable to me. I too used to grow up being the blacksheep of my community for my sexuality. Everybody in every nook and cranny hassles me and my family off for having a gay son, and mind you it was not a religious community, they just discriminated because they simply didn't like it. Then a few years later after I left that town, I became successful and have made a name for myself and going places, so I decided one summer to return back to that town to tend to my mother and grandmother still living there and still being hissed at by the local townspeople. Having seen me back, they saw clearly how much I changed inside and out, from the way I talk and think to the way I dress. Just like Tilly in the story, I was the one who stood out among the rest of the average folks in terms of how I look. And yet, my notoriety never left the local consciousness of them and I was being gossiped and looked at with strange mockery eyes. Still, I am now a grown up and wanted to contribute to this little town no matter how much they unreasonably despises me. They are now benefited from my success and financials and began taking advantage of me when it comes to asking for favor, but outside of favors, their distaste towards me never shifted. Just like in the film, my grandmother sadly passed away during my visit and my mom refuses to leave for she has become too accustomed to the town no matter how cruel they are. But I left and I brought all the benefits I helped for my town with me because I soon realized they don't deserve it. Just like the townspeople in the film, the townspeople in my town were also brass, shallow, gossiping, lustful for luxury, greedy, vindictive, malicious, and nasty (I even had a teacher like Miss Beula Harridene). I wish I could have left the town in sweet revenge like Tilly did in the film. But that's why, by and large, as you can see this picture really connects with me, a lot of the events mirror my own experience and I shared above. Some people dislike the picture understandably because they cannot connect with the character and the story, but I find it very empathetic because if the story speaks to you personally then it is much easier to connect with it.",The Dressmaker

Kate Winslet is inspiring beautiful and her acting is exceptional as ever. I have only seen Sarah Snook in a few films and had no idea that she was so hilarious. I had to rewind some of her scenes because they were just that entertaining. If you enjoyed Mean Girls of Devil Wears Prada, you may enjoy this film.

While all of the performances are outstanding, for me Judy Davis stood out. As Molly she encapsulates a woman who has been derided by her community, suffered loss, been mistreated by men and comes out the other side valiant and invincible. Her performance is a tour-de-force.

86,horsebeaverfoxman,If Tim Burton Were Trapped In Australia For A Year,6,18 November 2017,"The Aussie Outback is one of those lonesome frontiers, like the Arctic and the Southern American swampland, that we don't really see much in American cinema. We've had a few ""Max Max"" adventures and that 2008 film from Baz Luhrmann, but for the most part, its exploration is limited to indie films and foreign productions. And it's usually earnest and expansive, like ""The Rover"" taking on the wild Western genre, or it's scary and mined for horror, like in ""Kangaroo Jack"" -- wait, what was I talking about?""The Dressmaker"" drives Kate Winslet's titular seamstress Tilly out to the middle of nowhere, her way-out-back hometown where some unspeakable horror has occurred years ago. And supposedly, she's the perpetrator, though she doesn't remember. Neither does her senile, lunatic mother Molly (Judy Davis), who rambles about possums and presumably hasn't had a bath in years.There's weirdness afoot in town as well, where every character, from Hugo Weaving's delightful cross-dressing police sergeant to the hunchbacked chemist (mind you, it's the '20s), feels like a ""Twin Peaks"" small-town oddity on steroids.This is all helped along by the screwball execution of a rather dark story. Reminiscent of a Tim Burton film, there's slapstick antics and clever visual gags that shove a rocket up the ass of a considerably more somber tale of clearing one's innocence and seeking vengeance on some silly town gossips. Who says we can't have fun while we're exploring one woman's dark past?Well, the script, for one. Sometimes the story gets a little too deathly for its own good, and while writer/director Jocelyn Moorhouse knows when to slow down and let these moments breathe, much of the third act decides the film has been twiddling its thumbs for too long (it hasn't) and rushes forward with many shocking developments and hurried character beats.But what a strong first two acts! Moorhouse has a knack for zany scene construction, and the montages, arguments and introductions all bear the beautiful feeling of brevity. Tilly takes up the local trailer hunk (Liam Hemsworth) on his offer for a date. Fifteen seconds, tops. Tilly momentarily decides to give up dressmaking for good. Two minutes, in and out. Bam. Done. And while sometimes, this hampers the overall flow of the film, it sets up an exuberant tone out of the gate.The problems come with tone, and with how that energy can be kept up throughout the entire film. Moorhouse commits, thank goodness, to the wackiness, and she dials the Burtonosity of it all up to 11 for some inspired scenes on top of a silo at night, in a ostensibly innocent kitchen, or in a bride-to-be's frantic rush to Tilly's doorstep.The central relationships of Tilly with the hunky Hemsworth brother (sorry, was there more to his character that I was missing?) and with her mother are given ample attention, and we feel the weight they have in Tilly's life. Winslet's soulful performance cuts through her anxiety and fear with her smiles and her tenacity, which brighten up the first act and keep the fantastical, folksy machinations of the story as grounded as possible.But unlike Burton, Moorhouse knows when to pull in the reins. Her story is by no means ""Edward Scissorhands,"" though she tells it as if it were. ""The Dressmaker"" is as enamored with its endearing strangeness as it is with its characters and their history. Gorgeous shots of sunset over the Outback are given as much care and focus as the dresses Tilly crafts for the townspeople.The story itself, though, tends to divert its focus from where we want it most to be. The more fun townsfolk drop out of the story around the sagging middle of the film, and there's a sizable portion thereabouts where ""The Dressmaker"" suddenly doesn't have anything to do with Winslet's making dresses.But it's nothing Moorhouse doesn't try to overcome by indulging in her bizarre characters and screenplay. This isn't a bad thing at all, especially if, like me, you feel as if Hugo Weaving gets far too many serious roles and needs a good scene or two where he orgasmically heaves over fine fabric.",The Dressmaker

I don't really get what the point of the movie was - kind of a miserable and sad story.

It's a bit absurd and unrealistic but it has very charming qualities. The characters are funny, but sometimes a bit difficult to get into. I think that is because of the mystery, you don't get to know them straight away because their history is kept veiled for a while. The acting is amazing, the main characters and the side characters, they all shine. Liam Hemsworth is beautiful, but it's a little hard to believe Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth are the same age.

91,jsrobinson132,A Thoroughly Conflicting Night of Emotions,7,22 October 2015,"Well, that has to be the most conflicting movie experience I've ever known. I was invited to the premiere of The Dressmaker last night and I'm unsure whether I can say I loved it, hated it, thought it was hilarious, found it terribly sad, was frustrated because it was so weird or enjoyed it because some of the characters were so endearing - this movie caused all of these emotions and more. It's certainly entertaining - just so many roller-coaster sensations within the space of only a few minutes. A viewer will fluctuate continually between laughing raucously one minute only to find themselves experiencing deep sadness, anger, confusion or just plain asking yourself 'Why did they include this?' with the next breath. And they're a mix of the most quirky / weird / unlikeable / endearing / heartwarming characters I've ever seen / met. There was one character I didn't like at all, even though at some stages I still found myself laughing at some of their antics. I'm sure many readers will either disagree with me or think I'm referring to someone else - but that's okay, that's what makes us all different. The Dressmaker is definitely worth a look but not something I'd pay to see again - mainly because of the inclusion of that one character already referred to. This movie is very very dark in places and the ending is definitely not what you expect! The dialogue flurries and stubborn, though endearing, rapport constantly firing between Kate Winslet and Judy Davies are exceptional and certainly to be applauded. A very big hats off to Kate for a wonderful portrayal of an Aussie accent - you would swear she is a true blue Aussie. I have never heard anyone who wasn't born here to pull off an Aussie accent with such authenticity as she showed in this. Proves her calibre as an actress and the exceptional talent of Victoria Mielewska, her dialogue coach. Added to all of this, the budget must have been huge as every single person involved was easily recognisable from another movie or TV series - and most of them big Aussie names. So don't bother asking me whether you should go and see it - you'll just have to go along and see for yourself - but I can almost guarantee it's definitely not at all what you'll be expecting.

The stories have been uniquely Australian to be appreciated by Australian audiences but occasionally they become worldwide hits like Crocodile Dundee. It's the laid-back Aussie humour that international audiences sometimes just don't understand which prevents the majority of Australian films from crossing the cultural barrier. The Dressmaker has been successful at the Australian box office for it features a story where the underdog or misunderstood succeeds along with a story that promotes the Aussie dry wit with dialogue that appeals to the everyday Australian.Myrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) returns home to rural Australia after spending time abroad developing her fashion designing skills. As a child she was sent to a boarding school in Melbourne by Sergeant Farrat (Hugo Weaving) for she was accused of murdering a boy who bullied her. Her mother, Molly (Judy Davis) initially doesn't recognise her and isn't convinced she's her daughter. She eventually accepts her in her house and Tilly transforms it into a fashion factory where she makes clothes for the women of the town. In the meantime, she becomes romantically involved with Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) whom she has known since they were children. The town still hasn't forgiven her for apparently killing the boy and believe she is cursed. Tilly will virtually stop at nothing to exact revenge on those who did her wrong. The Dressmaker is a long way from being perfect but what it does offer is an entertaining two hours that is well-paced and beguiling. There might be a few too many flashbacks and slow motion sequences but the compelling storyline featuring a wide range of interesting characters allows the majority of the film to shine. Some of the depictions of the characters might be broad but that's just the perfect fit for quintessential Australians. A lot of the dialogue is witty and adds much to the Aussie humour on show. Davis garners most of the laughs in a performance which demonstrates her sensational acting ability. Winslet perfects the Aussie accent with this being her second time playing an Australian after 1999's Holy Smoke! Many of the scenes she shares with her screen mother are hilarious. Weaving also has his turn in the spotlight with a wonderful performance as the cross-dressing police officer. Hemsworth plays it straight in comparison to his co-stars and reliably fulfills his role as the love interest. Support actors such as Shane Bourne, Sarah Snook, Kerry Fox and Barry Otto also succeed in projecting the individual traits of their characters.Credit must go to the costume designs with the haute couture style befitting of the movie title. With the story being reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood western where the main character comes to town, mingles with the locals then affects their lives one way or another, the music score by David Hirschfelder has some resemblance to a western. It's an exciting score that perfectly sets up the moods of the characters and the theme of the plot. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine also enhances the look of the film, ensuring that the rural town maintains its 'western' appearance.Although clichés do affect the characters and story, the overall quality of the film ensures that most viewers will be entertained. Jocelyn Moorhouse (the director and co-writer) should be chuffed with her film's box office success even though not all critics have praised her work. Sometimes it's the majority you have to please, not the minority. http://mlaimlai2.wix.com/magical-movie-review",The Dressmaker
94,wisDOM87,Overrated mess,3,25 October 2020,"I've been on an Aussie film binge of late and came across this one which is supposedly a modern classic. It's actually an overrated mess - not sure whether it wants to be black comedy, a drama, a romance, or a quirky slice-of-life study that the Aussies do so well. It's all over the place and up being nothing, other than an overly long, confusing bore-fest. Boring 'plot', boring shallow characters, boring romance, boring twists and revelations, boring dialogue. Some of the dresses were nice and Hugo Weaving was intriguing as a cross-dressing copper, hence 3 stars. But I struggled to make it to the end and had completely lost interest about 2/3s in.

Populated by a swag of Aussie actors along with import Kate Winslet, the movie moves from lightness and comedic to something darker. The theatre was packed and the laughs were frequent and some of the audience were in stitches. Kate,the good dressmaker makes the most of her skill and if you are into fashion then you will really get a bonus. I was taken by Sarah Snook who looked luminous in her new rags - just shows what makeup and a smart dress can do for a girl.

The cast is fantastic, special mention to Judy Davis and Hugo Weaving who took their characters to town. Music from Australian composer David Hirschfelder (Shine & The Water Diviner) again outstanding! Cinematography from Don McAlpine was breathtaking, just gorgeous. Costume designs by Marion Boyce, the lady that dresses Miss Fisher Murder Mysteries has all the ladies in town dressed to kill.The Dressmaker is Australia's great novel in much the same way Great Gatsby or To Kill a Mockingbird is Americas and Pride & Prejudice is England's. I loved the book and was not sure whether it would translate into film accurately and do the book justice. Boy was I wrong. This is not a comedy, drama or tragedy movie, although there are some elements there, it's not solely comedy or drama or tragedy, it bears snippets of all these elements and so much more. It doesn't fit into any single genre and that's okay. I picked up immediately that some of the characters are in fact caricatures of small town people which is why they are over the top.I ADORE THIS MOVIE!!! It was worth every $ I paid and I can't say that about a lot of excruciatingly boring, unoriginal & lacklustre movies of 2015 such as Revenant and Spotlight. Watched the Dressmaker 5x at the cinemas.

106,maccas75,What did I just watch?,5,12 May 2016,"The problem with The Dressmaker is that it doesn't quite know what it wants to be. Feel-good Australian comedy? 1950s timepiece? Murder-mystery? TV-movie? Or a quirky revenge fable? It's inability to find a consistent theme and momentum is partly what leaves a funny taste in your mouth after viewing.How did the makers of this somehow lure the talents of Kate Winslet to the project? The cast is highly remarkable, filled with some of the most talented actors in Australia and abroad. It's just a shame their talents are largely lost in this screenplay.It features one of the most awkward movie-deaths of all-time. I hadn't read the book, so found it largely unexpected. I was struggling to develop a connection with the romantic element of The Dressmaker and just as I was beginning to, the bloke jumps down a hole and dies.After that and other story developments, I was half-expecting Kate's character to go fully-rogue. After pleading her innocence for most of the film, I was waiting for her to take to the town with a shotgun. Burning it to the ground was almost anti-climatic.This movie jumps around in time and tone so often, that I couldn't help but relating to the mental state of ""Mad Molly"" by the end of it. Unfortunately, a highly promising Australian movie once again falls flat at a time Australian productions are struggling for a consistent standard in quality.",The Dressmaker
107,karakovacs47,"Disappointing (very mild spoilers, I won't ruin anything though)",7,2 January 2017,"I was overall disappointed when I finally saw the film. I read the book ahead of time, which was much better, and that probably heightened my expectations of the film.To keep this brief, the 3 strongest parts were Kate Winslet's acting ability, the costumes, and the set design. The 3 weakest parts were the casting, the pace, and the acting of everyone else. GOOD1. Kate Winslet's acting: as always, Winslet was brilliant. She conveyed every emotion perfectly, and completely stole the film. 2. The costumes: this was massively important, as it is a central plot point. The dresses were spectacular, and they did a good job of making Una Stubbs' dresses ugly too.3. Set design: they perfectly captured Tilly's little cottage, the smudgy town, and the desolate landscapes. It was visually stunning, and I love the lavender on the porch. BAD1. The casting: this was the biggest problem for me. While Kate was phenomenal, no amount of good acting made me overlook the blatant age gap between her and her co-stars. Tilly is supposed to be a YOUNG girl- not 40. She was 15 years older than her love interest, Liam Hemsworth. Sarah Snook who played Gertrude Pratt, a girl supposed to be her age too, was about 12 years younger than her. It made it worse that they tried to act like they were all the same age, because they were clearly so far from it. It was distracting and off-putting. They either should have cast elder costars for Winslet or a younger actress to play Tilly Dunnage. Imagine Idris Elba playing a KKK leader- he could act perfectly, but his looks would make it hard for the audience to believe it entirely. Her body was also an issue. While she is a knockout, and has aged incredibly well, no one can pretend that she looks 25- or that her figure does. The idea that men would literally be stumbling and tripping over themselves because of her appearance at the rugby game was just not feasible. 2. The pace: the pace was choppy and unprofessional. The first half was pure comedy, and the second half all of a sudden became drama. They tried to include many plot points from the book, which made it feel more rushed and forced important details to be hastily shoved together. One part that they really shouldn't have rushed was the process of Teddy courting Tilly. In the book it took quite a while, where the movie version had Tilly going out with Teddy almost instantly. It took away from the suffering she had supposedly gone through in her past when she so quickly fell in love again. 3. The acting: I don't know if perhaps Australian films just have a different style, but as a Canadian watching, the entire thing felt overacted by the supporting cast. The attempted humour completely fell flat because no one knew the meaning of subtlety. I've seen descriptions calling it a ""black comedy"" and let me straighten that out right now-it is not at all. Judy Davis has gotten a lot of chatter on her role, and I will agree that her emotional parts were acted superbly. The ""funny"" parts, less so. However, I know what caliber of actress she is, as well as Caroline Goodall, which leads me to conclude that the fault lay with poor direction- not lack of talent. Overall, I was just waiting for it to end. If you are to watch it, perhaps you will not agree with my review, but I wanted to post it for reference regardless.",The Dressmaker

I actually liked the movie in general but just couldn't watch the half of it because the casting choices made it so incredibly unbelievable and awkward. And don't get me wrong, I love and adore Kate Winslet as an actress and she did nothing wrong. But portraying her as the same age as Liam Hemsworth and Sarah Snook, that's just silly! Minor spoiler (that is obvious within 5 minutes of watching); Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth are supposed to be each-others' love interest and known each other from when they were kids. But the 15 years of age-difference between the two actors make it a very weird and unsettling combination. If it was supposed to have a Mrs. Robinson vibe, I guess it would be fine, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't. Just to be clear; I hope to look as good as Kate Winslet by the time I'm her age, but 15 years whit the male as youngest, it's a gap that's hard to bridge. The story overall is actually pretty good, by the way!

The cast are brilliant and the dresses are truly, absolutely fabulous. I think my favourite scene is the women, wearing their fantastically out of place costumes, draping themselves in optimistically glamorous poses, in the main street. I don't care what the critics thought. I'm very glad I happened on this film and I can now watch it whenever the fancy takes me - depending only on access to a working DVD player.My DVD collection isn't large but it contains a mixture of comedy and historical drama mostly. Jane Austen dramatization dominate, TV series and films, plus some off shoots like The Jane Austen Book Club etc. CRANFORD, Wives and Daughters, are part of it too.

Wonderfully drawn characters and a story perfectly told through the sometimes very comedic caricatures of the residents of a dusty middle of nowhere outback Australian town.

118,irfan_meric,Loved how the story turned!,7,17 June 2016,"First of all, I really liked how the story blinked to clichés than said ""No, thanks. I don't buy that."" Poison of the society is something we struggle all the time and sometimes it becomes its the most destructive form. So, as a criticism of that, I liked the story's main idea... ""Small people's small problems bother those who can think of another."" I must mention Kate Winslet's performance was at a high level. She is truly an artist as an actress. (I hate sexist word seperations like actor/actress...What a lovely society!) Also her chemistry with his mother and the act was fascinating. But there were somethings missing. Visuals and places were well constructed but I have concerns about how the story from the book is adapted. The dark turn, which was out of cliché and well prepared, was rushed. I would expect all the characters to express their emotions, what they feel, what they think...There could be more scenes like a characters sits, express it with body language. But instead, to show characters' feelings the scenes were constructed like, ""something happens, another thing happens and another happens..."" I mean there should be scenes to process the story. The last 30 mins I was a little off the movie. Also, it was interesting to see the society's hypocritical choices about Myrtle's dresses. It was symbolic and a nice touch. And at the end, Myrtle burns the red fabric to burn down the whole town, which was also beautiful to express her feelings and to end the story. I should also mention the musical score. It was beautiful but in some scenes, it was not a font music, which was distractive. All in all, from the beginning to the ending, the story was the most important element and I wish we could see all the other elements of a movie werewell constructed in this movie. My heart is broken how the societycould be messed up by the people who cannot see themselves as an individual; sees some one shaped and designed by the community they live in. Teddy and Mrytle could be proud of themselves that they are not one of them. I wish all of our ""true"" personalities could manage to be free...",The Dressmaker

I'm sure it was meant to be that way, but it takes away from the characters in my opinion. I felt the movie spent lots of time pursuing irrelevant tangents and not enough truly developing the dislike we should have for the antagonists.

Part murder mystery, part dark comedy, The Dressmaker will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride, alternately making you lose faith in humanity, then regain it.Kate Winslet is breathtaking in her portrayal of Tillie Dunnage, a dressmaker with a mysterious past who grew up in a small, remote Australian town. Judy Davis is equally amazing as her mother, Molly Dunnage, an elderly woman over whom life has run roughshod. Hugh Laurie is his usual brilliant self, playing the town's policeman in public and a fashionista in private. And Liam Hemsworth is perfect as Tillie's love interest, Teddy, and manages to be both tough and gentle. The supporting cast did a fine job as the buttresses to the main players, believable characters all.The town is a veritable rubbish can of humanity, showcasing all of humanity's worst vices. The townspeople not only keep their secrets, they rewrite their history to cover their sins. Both Tillie and her mother have been victims of this self-delusional practice, to their detriment.

I don't know why, I guess it's probably since I haven't watched many revenge oriented movies. But oh gosh this was such a good movie:Kate Winslet (my favourite!) so brilliantly portrayed the character of Tilly Dunnage, with just the right attitude and that perfect accent. I knew she would amazingly execute her role.This movie is always moving. It's a very fast-paced story and includes so many twists you'll never know what to expect. I always like to predict what the next scene may be and this movie really surprised me at changing it's direction at pivotal moments. Yet every moment is so beautifully shown and watching this movie really excited me, in the sense that I felt so in the moment with the characters- thanks to the great cast that was chosen for this movie. There are characters you aren't supposed to like. I must say I really did hate them so much! But the good characters bring such positivity to the negative town of Dungatar that you really will love them!I have but one negative point. I didn't really feel the pain from the townspeople (those being, only the concerned people) I should've when watching a particular scene. For those who haven't watched the movie, you wouldn't know. But for those who have, I'm talking of the scene including Teddy and Tilly, when they lay near the silo at night.This movie gave me a very Grimm's Fairy Tale feel, with the raw fictional theme and with every twisted character. Also, the ending that really surprised me most definitely felt like a Grimm's ending!Overall , I'd say this movie was a big hit for me.

Although there is a great cast, Kate stands out with her amazing performance.
The only thing I find a bit disappointing, is that there is no chemistry between Kate Winslet and Liam Hemsworth, they were a bit odd together. At the movie, they supposed to be of similar age -or at least 3-5 years apart- but the difference between them is more than obvious.

In the beginning, I will say that costumes were nice and that the role of crazy mother was perfectly played.
Everything else just didnt make any sense.First thing is Kate Winslets age. She truly is one of the kind, beautiful woman but she simply cant pass as a woman of 25 who swoops the whole football team with her body. Also, its hard to follow the plot in which she is at least 10 years older than every other actor who is playing her former classmates.Second thing is the genre of this piece. Through the movie, its hard to follow whats happening (and to actually believe in it) because it looks like director couldnt decide whether to make drama, comedy or thriller so they decided to make all of it in 2 hours piece. In the end, it turned out into a movie thats neither funny, mysterious nor touching in any way.Third problem adds to genre and its storyline.
In the less than two hours, main character plans revenge and then all of the sudden wants to be accepted in community, finds out did she kill her neighbour in the childhood and then literally nothing happens with this info, gets boyfriend and he dies 5 min later but none of that interested me one bit because of horrible writing.

From bullying parts to little town's witch hunt The movie gives you more than just a few laughters. Sergeant's discovery process also adds some good spices. His love for details amazed me. The love story itself is so heart- fluttering. It also made me question why Academy pass this by. It could have a few nominations. So pity that It is ignored. At least It gets what deserved from local industry.",The Dressmaker

132,coloradosnowstorm,Unique and beautifully done,8,1 January 2018,"I loved the contrast in this movie between the beauty of Kate Winslet and her dresses and the ugliness and dirtiness of the town. The dry, subtle humor reminded me of what I loved in the films ""Chocolat"" and ""Edward Scissorhands."" The charming weirdness of the town and its occupants kept me engaged throughout. And of course, as always, Kate Winslet was stunning, authentic, and addictive. I only wish that they would have let Teddy live. But, I guess that would have taken away the opportunity for rage and revenge at the end, so I guess I can see why they did it. Overall, I very much enjoyed the movie and thought it was very well done.",The Dressmaker
133,Vytis,Not that great,4,3 November 2015,"This movie is a throw back to the 80s and 90s style of Australian film making. A spoof; quirky; Australiana. Really this type of film making should have ended with Priscilla. That was both mine and my partners impressions. But wait: separately one of my work colleges (mid 50s like moi) saw the movie with a friend and said the same thing!! We thought we were going to see a serious movie filmed in the style of ""Far from the Madding Crowd"". Nope.So what else was not to like?Kate Winslet being 15 years older (in real life) than all of her friends from school. Not very convincing. Especially as I believe Kate's character had travelled the world for 20 odd years. I suppose they needed a big star.Terrible and distressing storyline with really misogynistic men. If you do not like domestic violence then do not see this movie.A stupidly small made-up back lot town. Could they not pick a real country town from somewhere to make this movie? Like Hills End?Whats to like? The costumes. Ohh lah lah!!!So save your money and get this movie on Bluray or stream it.It could have been a contender.",The Dressmaker

But what makes it truely special is the combination of amazing acting (finesse and believable acting, even Kate's Australian accent!), cinematographery, ambiance/aesthetic and movie score.

138,craig-beard,Classic Australian Cinema at its Best - but it shows you how awful and just wrong many Critics are.,9,24 April 2016,"The Dressmaker is one of the best Australian movies since the golden age of Australian film making in the 80s and 90s. (The Thornbirds, Muriel's Wedding, Pricilla etc). But I don't understand the snubbing at the Ocars and the bad reviews from most of the critics some of the whom were downright insulting like @trim_obey a the Telegraph, ""the films biggest blunder...is mistaking Kate Winslet for Rita Hayworth"". (She wasn't cast as Rita Hayworth!) He goes on to say although Winslet managed to achieve the ""modest feat of managing a soft Aussie accent"" (that is not a modest feat; not even Meryl Streep could master it!) And just plain snide and idiotic ""the costumes are flat-out ghastly!"" errr, really?? Was Rita Hayworth's black satin dress in Gilda, one of the most famous in Hollywood history (to which you erstwhile incorrectly assumed Kate was actually playing Rita), ghastly?? Or did you mean Winslet couldn't fit in into the dress as well as Rita? To which she damn well did and was absolutely stunning (even though BOTH actresses just gave birth months prior to filming). And your review was full of errors: ""The local lads were playing Rugby"" (it was Australian rules or back then a local Victorian Football League final). If you're going to write a review and publish it in a quality paper such as The Telegraph, then at least watch the film without littering it with your own obvious prejudices, misogyny, snobbery and veiled homophobia.

139,jennifer-grimm,Such an unexpected and brilliant story!,8,23 June 2020,"You know how people sometimes say ""That movie is a bit like..."" well this movie isn't a bit like anything else. I will ramble on for a while here but since you probably are mostly curious about why I didn't give it a 9 or a 10 I want to start with that; it's just that for me it didn't spark very deep emotions. I'm a very emotional person and if I don't get the feels, I can't give it my top rating.Soundtrack is a big emotion trigger for me and I think this movie lacks a bit in that department. I can't remember any of the music - and I just finished watching it.Now I rarely write reviews, but this one just has to be promoted.
If you like movies with multiple twists this is a must-watch for you! I haven't read the novel (I didn't even know it was based on one until I came here) so everything in this movie took me by surprise.The actors were absolutely amazing, so was of course all the costumes.
I'm not one who is very into fashion, so I was afraid that this movie might be too much fashion-focused for me. But it definitely isn't like that.
Every character felt ""real"" and the actors really put their soul in their character.Now I can't really say much about the story progression without spoiling, so the only thing I want to say is that it kept me surprised and entertained the whole time. It's a real rollercoaster, and I love that.This movie is one of those that I will happily rewatch if it was to introduce it to a friend, but not one that I would watch over and over like I do for example Titanic.And on that note; Kate Winslet isn't only Rose in my head, now she's also Tilly.",The Dressmaker
140,lexiconby,"If you're a Kate Winslet fan like me, please proceed",10,9 October 2021,"Part way through the movie, three thoughts came to me. First, there's definitely an age difference in terms of how old her character should be relative to the story. Second, if not her, then which other actress could you cast in her place? Since it's an Australian production, one might thing that maybe there's a younger but still talented actress like say Margot Robbie whom I also think is a brilliant actress! Yes, it's possible that she could pull off this role...maybe. However, as I continue to watch the film, there are several scenes starting at around 1:28:19 which in my opinion cannot be delivered by anyone else besides the super talented Kate Winslet.This film gets 10 starts because it is a beautiful film with amazing acting by everyone. For all future film students, this film is an excellent example of the ""dark humor"" genre. It tries to elicit so many emotions out of the audience. Is this film realistic? No, but it sure is authentic, honest and quite rewarding!Go see for yourself:)",The Dressmaker
141,Kmurkve,Confusion,3,15 April 2017,"I made it 3/4 of the way through the movie before I finally gave up. I spent the whole 90 minutes wondering when I was finally going to start giving a crap. My biggest immediate issue was the range of ages in the casting. I'm all for women above the age of 35 being the lead in a movie, but not at the expense of believability. Kate Winslet was born in 1975, and she was supposed to be in the same age cohort as Liam Hemsworth who was born in 1990. Kate looks great, but she seemed like a cougar in this role.Like every other low reviewer, I had a hard time buying into any of the story lines. There's a murder mystery which is revealed to be a childhood accident (taking away what little tension there was in the movie), there is kind of a question of Winslet's paternity that is brought up when she is called a bastard and her mom a slut when she is younger (but honestly the way it was approached didn't even have me wondering who her father was), there is some curse that Winslet's character is supposed to have that is mentioned every once a while, there is a love story that is cut short in an important lesson to NOT JUMP INTO A SILO BECAUSE YOU MIGHT SUFFOCATE, then there is some dress-making that goes on because that's the title.Maybe the last half hour was redeeming? I don't know if I will ever find out. One star for the amazing outfits, one star for the sassy mother, and according to every Australian that loved this movie I should be giving one star for Winslet's convincing accent. Lack of stars due to poor editing, poor story telling, poor translation, and focus on giving personality to the townies. We get to see a husband rape his wife after he doses her with some sort of hysterical woman tonic, a cross-dressing law enforcer who will drop anything resembling ethics if presented with luxury fabric, and a bunch of other random crap.Apparently this was a book, and it should have stayed that way. Unless you're Australian, then you will probably love this movie for some reason.",The Dressmaker

Awesome and honest Australian setting, with totally memorable characters!

The adorable mother, Molly, who's memory is not too great but her outspoken ways are to the forefront; the flamboyant police officer who's 'love of good fabric' leaves us wondering just when or if he will finally make it out of his closet life.

143,collectivesylvias,Terrible and ridiculous,1,19 March 2016,"I'm absolutely shocked that this film has received such a high rating on IMDb. I think it's one of the worst films that Kate Winslet has ever done.The characters are not deep enough, the story is not believable and the sense of humour, or attempt to have some humour in it was pathetic and boring to say the least. Kate Winslet is not convincing at all, she seems to be in revenge mood but it's like she doesn't mean it. Not even the relationship with her mother makes you feel any type of emotion for them. Basically the film doesn't move you at all.Her relationship with the character who plays Liam Hemsworth is also dull and meaningless. Again not great love story here, just plain boring and I won't go into any details but it's almost laughable the way this relationship evolves. Then from then on you have nonsensical dramas all over, that never seem to end and make no sense at all. The police officer for example is OK but they try to make him funny but it just doesn't work. They're not funny. Predictable plot. Quite frankly I wanted to leave the cinema I just stayed because I paid a lot of money so I was wondering if it would pick up. But a total waste of time. The only positive side of this film are the dresses but apart from that, choose another film if you really want to enjoy a day at the cinema. You won't be missing anything if you don't watch it. And for Kate Winslet's standards her performance here is well below par.Silly plot and not what I expected at all. Totally forgettable.",The Dressmaker

146,amandapavik,Wake Up Call,9,27 September 2016,"Maybe it was the star studded cast, or perhaps the time period in which this took place, or maybe even the outfits that brought you to the decision of considering this movie. But what it really is going to be is the transformation of these characters on screen in this adaptation of a screenplay that P.J. Hogan was stitched together. It was every characters personal decisions that seamed the events and characters of this film in a jarring and exposed narrative of our human condition.The Dressmaker opened up the eyes of the viewer to how we can let people define our roles or how, with the support of loved ones, we can begin to define our own character. While the outfits were stunning (one for me please), what really spoke to me in this film was the handy craftsmanship of Kate Winslets character Tilly.We've all found ourselves existing in narratives that we have to fall in line with. Whether it is our family dynamics, our community, or even the era in which we live, The Dressmaker made a point to completely diverge from its norm, just like the transformations this small town took to ""wake up"" in the final act. That we as individuals also have to do for ourselves.Haunted by a moment in her life, Tilly finds herself back home in a small town that forced her out. And what the town had created was a magician who changed not only the fabric of their clothes and identities, but their lives forever. First settling in her traditional role within the town as the daughter of the ""mad woman"" and the ""murderer"" who lives on the hill during the first act; Tilly works her way with every dress to find out what exactly happened in her childhood that changed the fate of not only herself, but that of her mother's current mental state. The town is constantly shunning Tilly and the truth of her past, while manipulating her talents as a seamstress for their own betterment. At first Tilly agrees to this arrangement, but with the help of a local man Teddy McSwiney played by Liam Hemsworth , his love and striking attention for her begins to shift Tully's own role within the town. It isn't until her deranged mother begins to recognize, not only her daughter, but the power her daughter has, leads this heroine down a path in recognizing who she really is, and not what this town has made her.With a cast of this caliber and a story unique like this one, our conditioned minds crave for that ""happily ever after"" moment. That quickly cinders in a more real and tangible way, with every scene up until the end. If only all of us can take a good look at our lives like Tilly has, or even Sergeant Farrat played by Hugo Weaving. We can all take a deep sigh and move forward.",The Dressmaker
147,ladyevieg,Possibly one of the best movies of all time,10,11 September 2017,"Warning - Potential SpoilersIf you haven't yet seen this gem of a film because its flown so far under the radar, you should consider that initially The Shawshank Redemption did exactly the same – that is until audiences discovered it and placed it firmly in most everyone's top ten best films of all time.The Dressmaker is something true movie lovers should definitely consider (I defy you not to love it so much you rush out to buy it on Blu-ray immediately afterwards) but it does come with a warning. If like me you love a good drama with a serious emotional roller- coaster built in – you will need both a stiff drink and a box of tissues close by. Set in the 1950's the film centers around a dressmaker (Winslet) who returns from a successful career in Fashion Central Europe to her Australian outback home to face her past. Accused of murdering one of her classmates at the tender young age of 10 years old, she has no real memory of the event and is determined to discover the truth behind his death in order to clear her name. The premise may not be an original one but don't let that fool you. What unfolds beyond this point becomes one of the most gripping dramas I have seen in an age. Her hometown is perhaps so far away from reality it could be set in the 1900's let alone the 1950's and what becomes very clear from the outset is the underlying currents of hatred, prejudice and sheer malevolence that have poisoned the townsfolk. As the lies and secrets start to unravel, the shock starts to set in both on screen and with the audience as the only true innocent character in the town is killed. It is at this point the story turns a corner and there is absolutely no going back as more characters succumb to their fates. This film grips its audience with every emotion felt on screen, fear, hatred, love, sadness, with genuinely powerful performances from Winslet, Davis and (surprisingly) Hemsworth. If until now you have considered this young actor to be simply eye candy, The Dressmaker will most definitely change your mind.This journey will leave you bereft of every emotion but convinced you have just witnessed possibly one of the best movies of all time.",The Dressmaker

The ending is theatrical and effective. I enjoyed the movie, but then I read the book and realized that they butchered the plot. The original has so much more to offer! I understand that compressing a novel into a 2 hour movie is impossible and some subplots need to be sacrificed, but they dumbened the story up and removed some of the most important story lines, and all for the sake of what? To cater to dumber audience? To make things more Hollywood-like? To cheapen it by doing age old movie tricks?Why was it necessary for Beula to trash the child's life and to false witness? The story was complex, and now we have this Wizard of Oz style town crow that takes down a 10-year old ""I'll get you my pretty, and your little dog too!""? How primitive and cliche!That was very disappointing to me.They took a perfectly good story and turned it into a string of cliches.I didn't find Winslet as compelling as Tilly as some other viewers did. Molly was excellent, and many other characters stayed true to the original. Farrat was very good, though, again, I didn't understand the movie's twist on his story.

After watching it on Amazon video, I'm glad I didn't go through the trouble of paying 20 dollars for watching it. This movie is just a whole lot of ""What.... why? Wtf?...."" ""Uhhhhhh...."" I had hoped there was some higher meaning for the events that occurred, that there was a great underlying plot to it all, and maybe, just maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel, but, there isn't. The plot and ""moral conflict"" is so weak it can be barely called that. I like quirky movies, and no, a movie doesn't have to make sense for it to be enjoyed. But this movie has these events that seem random just for the purpose of being random. There is no higher meaning, no greater mystery, nothing at all. It would have been better if Tilly had never come back. A catwalk of beautiful designs would have been more enjoyable. (the dresses are the only reason it even got a 6) Where was the romance? There were more scenes of the old lady with Liam than anyone else. And what the heck was the point of him dying? To tell us she really is cursed? Okay. I don't feel sad for him, more of ""that's kinda random"" moment. The audience had not yet given the time or right amount of charm to fall in love with him before killing him.

Our heroine is also, very obviously, 15 (at least) years older than her contemporaries. She has come to town to get revenge on the townsfolk for a wrong done. Making dresses for the local ladies seems to be the way to accomplish this. Where does all this fabric come from? This is a tiny town out in the middle of nowhere and somehow all this fabric materializes (no pun intended) for all these dresses. Then out of nowhere another dressmaker shows up! Competition? Where is this story going? Romance? No chemistry there. He's handsome, yes. She's good looking. But wooden, both. He jumps into a silo of grain - we're shown this with the mice running around in it. Then we find out it was sorghum and he drowns in it. It's grain, then sorghum. Aaack! What else can happen in this screwy film? It could have been a good story with our heroine finding out what really happened when she was a child that caused her to be sent away, creating a relationship with a mother she's not seen in 25 years and maybe finding true love in the process.

Hugo Weaving was just brilliant, as he always is in roles. Shane Bourne was adventitious assuming a role that may change public perceptions about him. I found the plot twists rather jarring, and at times, what the actors revealed was personally uncomfortable to me. That said; there is great depth to these plot twists. Even some days after the initial viewing, I find myself replaying the movie in my mind and seeing more detail bubble to the surface. Give it ten years and Hollywood will remake this movie.

That they are both Australian, says much about our film sector and their ability to tell amazing stories.This film took Sue Maslin 7 years to get to screen, 7 years to get the $17m it took to make it, maybe that amount of time gave PJ Hogan, his partner Jocelyn Moorehouse and author Rosalie Ham to really create a wonderful script and for Sue to gather a company of artists who could bring the story to life.

I mean okay they didn't have a huge budget but the town was almost like a village with only 8-9 buildings and the main cast wasn't large, so they should had enough money to build a real set instead of using terrible chroma key compositing.In general acting was okay but I think Judy Davis made all the difference in old crazy bitch role. She was so real that for a second I doubted her sanity. I would recommend you to watch the movie just because her performance.

UNTIL they continued for another half hour and ruined it all. It was sort of like evil triumphing over evil. I felt sort of like when I was watching Downton Abbey and they killed off Matthew and piled heartache after heartache on Lady Edith. The Dressmaker was great - until it wasn't.

168,tonia_marshall,I read the book and wasn't disappointed with the movie,9,30 October 2015,"I took my 13-year-old son to see this with me and we both thought it was the best movie we'd seen all year. We laughed out loud for the first 30 minutes. I read the book last year and I wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Some parts were funny, some sad. The ending wasn't what I wanted to happen, but the characters were great. I loved the descriptions of silks and satins and needlework. I enjoyed the movie more than the book as I knew where it was going. The story is set in a tiny outback town in Australia in the 1950s. Tilly Dunnage (Kate Winslet) was sent away as a child and is now returning. She looks like Veronica Lake, all bright red lipstick and Dior inspired outfits. But it quickly becomes clear that she is not welcome. It is only when the locals realize she can make them look fabulous that they begin to tolerate her.There are flashback and hints as to what it was that forced Tilly to leave. I won't say anymore as I don't want to spoil the story. Believe me, it's a good one! Judy Davis (who plays Tilly's doolally mother) plays a great part; she reminded me of Maggie Smith. All the characters are larger than life, but it's a comedy. The part where Liam Hemsworth takes his shirt off (watch the trailer) had some of the audience cheering!",The Dressmaker
169,davestreelopping,Don't waste your time!,1,13 November 2015,"This was a disappointing film in virtually all respects. Strained acting, combined with a ridiculously unbelievable plot which was heavily overacted throughout. Don't get sucked in by flowery reviews if you are looking for an enjoyable, meaningful experience. This film lacks substance, struggles to be funny, and isn't consistent with the time frame that its set in. Rather it awkwardly tries to meld modern themes into a time and place where they don't belong and likely didn't exist! I'm 60 and grew up in Victoria so I have a pretty good idea. I Strongly recommend you look elsewhere for some worthwhile viewing. Maybe the late night movie?",The Dressmaker
170,julietb-01075,"Brilliant, funny, heart wrenching and beautiful",10,14 November 2015,"Brilliant movie. Kate Winslet as the star lives the role so perfectly you forget she is not a native born Australian - her accent is flawless, her acting is raw and beautiful. The movie is heart wrenching, darkly funny, shocking and confronting all in a delightful way. Judy Davis is brilliant - irascible as Mad Molly, you gradually discover her depth and beauty. Again flawlessly played. Hugo Weaving is fantastic as always - several laugh out loud moments with him. He is the consummate actor and where someone else playing this role would have just been a plain unlikeable weirdo, Hugo makes you love him and his quirky nature. Liam Hemsworth is sweet and very watchable. The townsfolk played by many notable Australian actors are well played also. All in all a wonderful movie that will touch your heart in many ways. Liked it so much, I will definitely go and see it again. It's THAT good.",The Dressmaker
171,hthivierge-61774,A Movie with Surprising Healing Power,9,27 February 2016,"Before deciding to write a review for The Dressmaker, I read a scathing review of the movie that called it a choppy dark comedy that was all over the place. I agree the movie is ""all over the place"", but it is for a very good reason. ""The Dressmaker"" is about facing one's past, and the Pandora's box of secrets and emotions that usually opens. It can also trigger new events, some great and some bad. It's how well one navigates through all of that determines how much said person heals when all of the dust settles, so that they can move on to their next chapter in life as whole a person as possible. And Winslet's character navigates well. I felt a surprising sense of healing after watching this movie. This movie gave me happy tears, and has helped me decide to finally go back and face my past. The movie is full of charm, wit, and obviously, style. My only gripe is the lack of Australian accents in the movie. I forgave Winslet's character not having one, as her back story explained why not. But there was no excuse for the other main characters. The only memorable Aussie accent in the movie is Chris Hemsworth's, who was born there.",The Dressmaker
172,martelgeorge,mind blowing on an intellectual level,10,5 April 2016,"THIS FILM IS INTENDED TO SHRED APART YOUR PRECONCEPTIONS!!! Do not go into watching this film with the idea that you are watching a tragedy. You may not connect with the majority of the characters. They may not feel entirely three dimensional. You may not empathise with them and you are not intended to. It is extraordinarily true that you do not get what you expected from the trailer of this film. However, what you will get will most definitely blow your mind whether you appreciate the artistry of such postmodern blurring of genres or not. It is important to note that many of the critics (but by all means all) whom have given bad reviews to this film, do not entirely understand the essence of genre itself. Whilst the Aristotelian theory of genre concludes that genre is a fixed ridged entity, whereby texts must possess specific content, form or features in order to belong to a selected genre, modern theorists understand that genre cannot be a fixed entity as these conventions are too narrow to classify all texts under. Genre is an extremely dynamic concept and changes or evolves along with it's context. Therefore, genre now - as a taxonomy of works - classifies texts according to their intended purpose, recurring priori actions as well as it's relationship with it's audience. Whilst The Dressmaker may initially present itself as a western film or even a Gothic film, this does not mean that the film is in that genre! The Dressmaker is a COMEDY. Indeed it possesses many MODES of other genres, however, the film intends to SATIRISE the attitudes modeled by many in 1950's Australia. And this - my dear friends ... and foe - is EXTREMELY CLEVERLY DONE!!!!! I have read many reviews of this film whereby the responder has said something along the lines of ""this film doesn't even know what it is"" or ""The mix of genres is a mess"" oblivious to the fact that this is the intended purpose of the film. The film combines elements of many genres and sub-genres including Gothic, western, thriller, crime, horror, tragedy, comedy, farce, satire, slapstick and black humour just to pinpoint a few. As a satire, the film uses absurd humour to highlight major issues within this 1950's society. Issues such as abuse of power, rape, deceit, sexuality, misogyny and hypocritical attitudes. The post-war 1950's is ostensibly known as a fruitful decade however Jocelyn offers a far more ignominious perspective on a time that was tainted with misogyny and hypocrisy, and the extend those guilty of such behaviours would go to in oder to save face. The essence of satire is to make you laugh as an audience and then make you question what you are laughing at! Whilst many have thought that this could only be the work of an uneducated lunatic, this mixture of generic modes is a quintessential example of the blurring lines between genres and adds an element of shock to narrative. The technique is intended to add an distinct absurdism to the storyline, and the deficiencies of the gross caricatures that are the townsfolk are distorted in order to draw attention to the cultural or social issues within society that are still contextually relevant today! Yes, the film exposes relics or icons that were not relevant to it's contextual time-frame, however these are intentional! They are supposed to make you question why the director has included them! Like how these issues are still relevant today on some level. Remember that everything placed in a film is intended to depict SOMETHING. I am an 18 year old year 12 student currently studying the notion of Genre in Extension 1 English, and this movie literally blew me away! It is just so so so so clever! Like the way it includes familiar or traditional narratives such as the revenge plot of a western film or ugly duck makeover of Gertrude Pratt, to then take those familiar narratives in an ENTIRELY different direction, so that just when you believe you know what to expect, you are presented with something completely different. Or the way the characters names perfectly reflect their personalities. Mayor ""PETTYman"" etc. What is even more interesting to me is the set design, looking like an imposed western saloon set on an Australian outback scene. This almost gives the impression that we are witnessing some kind of bizarre human experiment. This is intended to distance the audience from the characters. None is quiet life-like enough to be relatable, except for Tilly and Molly Dunnage and perhaps Teddy. However, whilst tragedy is intended to make the audience empathise with multiple characters, comedy does not require this. Therefore the audience is supposed to feel obscured from many of the caricatures in the film, and they are not supposed to be realistic or relatable, rather they represent an ideology, attitude or perspective. It is this distance between the audience and the characters that allows the audience to make their own distinctions about the insane situations that occur within the film. I could ramble endlessly about this film and it's effect on me, however instead I will just give a word of warning: When watching this film be aware of it's social and cultural context. Be aware of that which it is drawing your attention to, not only within the film but in the wider world. Be aware that the acting is exquisite that each character is intended to elicit a response from you. but most of all...be prepared. Be prepared to laugh, to question, to cry, to scoff and to be utterly shocked or even horrified. This film is an utterly beautiful piece of genius. Enjoy it thoroughly....or don't.",The Dressmaker
173,leotltd,"Beautiful, heart-warming movie of love, drama and fashion",8,23 June 2016,"The movie is great in general, with many spectacular scenes. The existence of accusation, murder, revenge, drama and of course, romance makes the movie worth watching. The best scene of the movie, I say, is when Tilly run away from the wedding, Teddy run after her and take her back to the place where the boy killed himself twenty years ago. The moment when Teddy help Tilly face her utmost tragedy. How it happened, what really happened, she remembers it now, she now faces it, that moment is gold. The scene when Teddy and Tilly on the bed together, talking about their future plan, about running away together, starting a new life, even bringing Tilly's Mother and Teddy's brother with them and away from the town. I feels like there are more than that and that happy ending is just not gonna work for the characters and the audiences. Teddy and Molly, they belong to the town. They are town people. But Tilly, she is a big woman, with a gifted talent; she can do much more than cleaning house, taking care of babies and family and making dress for local people. It's such a waste of her talent to spend the rest of her life in that town. The world needs her, she belong to fashion, like Paris and Milan. She is THE DRESSMAKER. So definitely, the idea of Tilly and Teddy running together for a happy ending just doesn't work for both of them. That's maybe a good idea for Tilly but not for Teddy. He's gonna be miserable and their love is just not gonna last. So right at that moment, I doubt the movie is gonna end with that ending. But I knew that Tilly, she's not gonna bury her feet in that town. She will definitely leave it when she finishes her business. However, I can't help but think about her loved ones, her mother and her childhood friend/lover Teddy. What's gonna happen to them when she decides to leave? The town seems to be small, so small that nothing really happen there in the past twenty years. Everything in the past is kept and told from generation to generation like folklores. Even people, they don't change at all. And that is the hardest thing, but as soon as you realize that truth, you feel more released inside. You can't change people, and your family and friends are the only ones you should spend most of your time with. Other people, they either don't know you or don't know you well enough to make your life miserable. Revenge, I say, is drama and I love to see drama on films. There must be more than just coming back home, visiting mom and neighborhood and then saying bye. Somebody is gonna pay for what they did. And yes, it happens like a chain of falling domino. And those parts of drama are the best in this movie, beside sweet romance and humors. It's funny, it's not too much romance, just enough to make you feel like falling in love, and drama of course. Most importantly, the movie makes me to think about myself, about life and my decisions. How the movie ends is just brilliant. At first I just feel terribly sad for good people who die, but then, I finally see it. It is the best option for Teddy, for Molly and for Tilly. Those people, they deserve more than that town. The ending for those characters are just logical and sympathetic. I have to say, movies like this get me in the heart.",The Dressmaker

Here, the people were living in a minute community cut off from bigger ones and jealousy, secrets, adultery, wife battering, vocal harassment and bullying amongst children were accepted as the norm. The one person who got away is the most sane one and we follow her fight to get to the bottom of her story as if she was our own off-spring.

It's got strikingly similar flavors, a disjointed reality, the ""setting"" views through the cameras and perspectives, the near-absurd characteristics and surrealism, with yes, an underlying set of personal stories often bizarre. I reckon the Australian ethos contributes immensely to the movie's quirkiness, at least as viewed from Texas. As I pay more attention to many of the scenes' visual framings, it is obvious how much genius there is in the director's eye. Many scenes could be images in a modern art gallery.

Winslet is too old for this role, even though she is beautiful and looks amazing in her dresses...as does everyone else who wears one of her character's creations.I've not read the book, but the characters in the film were as unbelievable as the plot. Tilly comes back for revenge armed with a....sewing machine? She was wronged by a town that believed she committed a murder she couldn't remember? Until she did, helped by an unbelievable heart-of-gold impossibly handsome guy? How convenient!The tiny town in the middle of nowhere was made of a lot of dirt, some corrugated tin, and enough wood to make it flammable. And the originally frumpy female inhabitants just somehow wanted to dress to the nines every freaking day? You know, right after the hated Tilly comes back wearing Paris couture fashion? Of course they would want to emulate someone they hated.Only two people witnessed the (flashback) incident when the boy died of a broken neck...and the one who remembered how it REALLY happened was the ""slow brother ""? Of course.And speaking of this ""slow"" brother of Liam's character...why does HE know what's in the silo (sorghum which apparently will not support a person but will swallow and suffocate that person), but Liam's character doesn't know this when he jumps in and dies, trying to prove to Tilly that she is NOT cursed? Who's the slow brother now? Sorry...a completely stupid plot twist, to me. And he wouldn't have jumped in and died had she only uttered ""I am not cursed!""...she has a few minutes of grief but no angst over guilt? Then she gets on with her revenge...sorry, just not believably portrayed.The cross dressing cop....come on! No one in the tiny dusty town knew? BS plot device.The Clint Eastwood style western music falls flat.

180,emilymayofok,Save Yourself-- don't be reeled in!,1,22 August 2017,"If there are light spoilers in this review, count it as a blessing, perhaps they will save you from watching this (**shudder**) film. The audience is introduced at the beginning (with inappropriately creepy music) to a supposed murder of a young boy committed by a young girl, Tilly (the dressmaker). Tilly is then, heartlessly sent away and becomes an incredible fashion designer, ooh la la. (Side note: the costumes ARE fantastic, but if that is all that draws you, mute this film). The Director must have had her fingers-crossed the audience accepts the notion that young Tilly was capable of murder, as both believable and interesting. Unfortunately it is painfully obvious it couldn't have been anything but an accident, largely due to the comedic tone of the film. The experience is similar to a fish being offered a plain, bait-less hook to bite and be reeled in on. The hinted darkness is eye-roll worthy. ""The Dressmaker"" is silly, silly, silly. Silly you say? But like, fairy-tale-esque? No. Is it whimsical?? If on a 1950's small-town-eccentricities end, then sure. This is well-executed by Judy Davis (the Dressmaker's ""mad"" mother, Molly) and Gyton Grantley (the Dressmaker's love-interest's mentally-handicapped brother, Barney). Those actors seemed to grasp the comedic tone the Director desired for the story. BUT ALAS! all their charm is marred by Winslet and Hemsworth's seriousness-- more fit for a drama. Their romance, BTW, is so inexplicable and poorly established that their tender words and emotions are laughably (and uncomfortably) devoid of understandable substance. Seriously speaking, the mother, Molly was more fit as a love-interest for Teddy than Tilly. But of course, the viewer was supposed to tick ""The Two Most Physically Attractive Actors SHOULD End Up Together"" box on their Film Trope List. As long as this box was checked, then the rough dirty boy Teddy and the fashionable damsel Tilly may be understood as deserving all the depth of love, emotional-intelligence and devotion previously established by love's literary superheroes, Mr. Darcy and Miss Eliza Bennett. There were about 3 different times the film could have ended and put us and the characters out of misery, but instead the yarn got away from the weaver of this story and it became more and more ludicrous. Let this be read with emphasis: NOT in an enjoyable B-Movie way. It is safe to say, Tilly should not have returned home and spared us this story. Do not bother watching.",The Dressmaker

I'll admit, though, that I watched the whole thing. It was like a bad train wreck that I couldn't stop watching. The story line and the characters are just plain awful. It reminded me of a really bad Peyton Place with a town of barely two dozen people where every single of of the town's inhabitants needs to be checked into a loony bin. One thing that isn't quite right about the description of the movie is that it's supposedly about a woman who comes back to her childhood town where she takes revenge on those that did her wrong. Well that is NOT what happens in the movie. The woman comes back believing that she murdered a kid when she was 10, but she has no recollection of it. It's more like she comes back to find answers. In the beginning struggles with some of the town folks, but they warm up to her because she makes them look pretty and fancy in our dresses that she designs and sews. But then all hell breaks loose when this evil old hag reminds the town that she killed a boy when she was 10 and even though it isn't true the whole town goes off on her. But then when the town wants to win some goofy talent show contest they come back to her asking for her help to make them pretty again and she basically tells them to get lost. In the end she helps the people from the neighboring town win the competition and while the people in her town are fuming mad and head back to town she in the meantime has set fire to the whole place and moves to Paris. So in other words she didn't kill anyone and yet she's made out to be the bad person and in the end she kind of was when she burned the town down. It didn't make any sense. Why burn the town.
