0,TheLittleSongbird,"Very good, very funny and charming",8,6 November 2010,"I have to say I enjoyed Parenthood. While a tad too long and a little leisurely, it is very funny and charming with a lot to like about it. Ron Howard does a very nice job directing, and holds the different story strands together really well. The film looks lovely and benefits hugely from a sharp script and a beautifully constructed and affectionate story. The acting also elevates this film to a higher standard. The supporting cast that consist of Dianne Wiesst, Martha Plimpton, Rick Moranis, Mary Steenburgen, Keanu Reeves and especially Tom Hulce all give fine performances, but it is Steve Martin in one of his better performances who has the acting honours. I also enjoyed some of the set pieces, Martin's cowboy turn at his son's birthday party especially was a complete hoot and by far one of the film's highlights. All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this film especially for the script and the acting. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Parenthood
1,SnoopyStyle,Great family fun,8,12 October 2013,"Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) tries to be a better father than his own unavailable father. It's the funny story of the extended Buckman family from Ron Howard. Mary Steenburgen plays his wife. Dianne Wiest plays his single-mother sister. Rick Moranis and Harley Jane Kozak play the uptight parents. Tom Hulce is the black sheep of the family. The great list of actors include Joaquin Phoenix, Keanu Reeves, Jason Robards, and Martha Plimpton.This is just a fun and insightful look at big family dynamics. It's got both pathos and comedy. This is possibly Ron Howard at his best. It would be easy to drive this multi character storyline chaos into an unmitigated mess. All the different characters could have been reduced to stereotypes. Instead these characters feel like they truly fit in a family. This is a great feel good movie.",Parenthood
2,mark.waltz,You've only got one life to live so keep your children out of another world.,10,8 July 2021,"This is really a comical soap opera, the combined stories of four siblings, the offspring of the emotionally distant alcoholic Jason Robards who spent more time drinking and living in his own fantasy world, favoring the youngest (Tom Hulce), the blacksheep, while dealing with the others (eldest Steve Martin and daughters Dianne Wiest and Harley Jane Kozak) through ignoring them or wisecracks. Martin and Wiest are equally neurotic, dealing with their own troubled children as best as they know how (sometimes far too nurturing and clinging), while the somewhat sensible Kozak is stuck with the uppity husband Rick Moranis whose advanced ideas of child rearing are far too bizarre to go into practice.Martin's oldest son, Kevin, gives him and his beautiful wife Mary Steenburgen a lot of worry as their concern over his excessive emotions has them debating their parental skills. Martin has a series of bizarre fantasies over how Kevin will grow up, but their issues are nothing compared to the divorced Wiest who finds that teen daughter Martha Plimpton is sleeping with a boy (Keanu Reeves) she can't stand and son Gary is resentful over being rejected by his remarried father. Wiest (Oscar nominated for her showy performance) and Martin try too hard to be good parents, unintentionally damaging them, although there are some tender moments with them as well, and a surprising one between Wiest and Reeves has a piece of wisdom I've heard from my own mother, although not quite put in the way Reeves says it.Eileen Ryan, as the mother of the four adults, and especially Helen Shaw as her loveable mother, offer a few scene stealing moments, and every moment with great grandma is a special one, especially each eye roll over her realization that her descendents are all idiots. Moranis and Hulce, fantastic in other films, are completely wasted here, their characters rather unlikeable and underdeveloped. Still with what is there concerning Martin, Wiest and to a lesser point Kozak (who really deserved a better career as an actress, even with her early appearances in contract roles on three soap operas), you've got a fabulous story of family and the types of issues that often question why we keep them around. The writing and direction are very special here with Ron Howard showing wisdom as well as heart. This is the type of film that you can revisit every couple of years and learn something new.",Parenthood
3,lee_eisenberg,Steve Martin and Ron Howard. Hmmm...,7,22 June 2006,"In ""Parenthood"", Ron Howard looks at the vicissitudes of having a family. Focusing on several families, the movie makes the most of itself. Steve Martin is the nominal star, but many other people show themselves to be just as capable in their roles, especially Mary Steenburgen as Martin's ever-loving wife, and Tom Hulce as the immature sibling. Some parts seem to have been thrown in for comic relief (like that one song), but the movie never gets idiotic. A particularly funny scene is what Steve Martin does at the birthday party (and specifically, how he explains his presence).All in all, this movie makes family life look scary, fun, weird, and insane, all at the same time. It's one flick that you won't find boring. Also starring Dianne Wiest, Jason Robards, Rick Moranis, Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves, and even a very young Joaquin Phoenix.",Parenthood
4,jboothmillard,Parenthood,7,10 March 2008,"From director Ron Howard (Splash, The Grinch), this is a feel-good family film that may not be suitable for young ages (it's a 15, for the swearing), but a good film for those who can watch. It is basically all about the joys (and otherwise) of bringing up children, i.e. being a parent, literally what the title suggests. Gil Buckman (Golden Globe nominated Steve Martin) and wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen) are having to cope with changes to the life of their autistic child. Gil's sister Helen (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Dianne Wiest) is raising her seemingly disturbed son Garry Buckman-Lampkin (Joaquin Phoenix, as Leaf Phoenix) going through puberty and daughter Julie (Martha Plimpton) who is having a sexual relationship and then marriage to nitwit boyfriend Tod Higgins (Keanu Reeves). Gil's others sister Susan Buckman (Harley Jane Kozak) has a sweet daughter with husband Nathan Huffner (Rick Moranis) who is arrogant and overly obsessed with making the daughter smart. Finally, Gil's youngest sibling brother Larry Buckman (Tom Hulce) has drifted into get rich quick schemes, and had ended up owing money to the mob, or face the consequences. Also starring Jason Robards as Frank Buckman and Jasen Fisher as Kevin Buckman. Many moments of laughs and giggles, but the highlights for me were Martin dressed as a cowboy for a birthday party, and Moranis singing ""Close To You"" in a classroom to win back his wife. It was nominated the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Song for Randy Newman's ""I Love To See You Smile"". Very good!",Parenthood
5,moonspinner55,"Director Howard brings it together for a sweet finish, yet most of ""Parenthood"" is woefully unsubtle...",5,5 April 2009,"Intelligently-crafted, though ultimately uneven and shallow mosaic of stories centering on the members of a large, colorful modern family. Director Ron Howard has a tough time getting the picture's rhythm going, and for the first two-thirds of an hour it does nothing but meander and flail away on stale jokes. The screenplay, by Howard's real-life pals Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (with help from Howard himself), isn't too wacky, yet the film is full of peaks and valleys. Since the writing isn't initially assured, the tone of the picture swings from comically-credible to cartoonish. The performances by the cast are uneven, too, ranging from fine (Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Tom Hulce and Jason Robards) to dull (Keanu Reeves and Martha Plimpton) to over-exaggerated (Dianne Wiest, who received an Oscar nomination and most of the critical plaudits). Ganz and Mandel aspire to touchy-feely, fuzzy family comedy, so it comes as a surprise that parts of ""Parenthood"" are actually rather crass, while Howard, as a director of comedy, needs to reel-in his penchant for cuteness. ** from ****",Parenthood
6,ComedyFan2010,A movie that is both touching and funny,9,3 May 2018,"I started watching it expecting it to be a silly comedy but it ended up more than that. It is funny but it turned out to be also deeper. It shows different type of parents and different issues that they face with their kids that many people can connect with. It never goes over the top and becomes unrealistic. Just portrays the issues we may have faced in real life in a really good way.The acting is also on top level. I enjoyed all the performances. And it was also great to see Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves and Joaquin Phoenix in their early years. The younger children who as I see didn't remain in acting as adults were also really good. Much better than one usually sees young children acting.It is nice how it goes into sensitive topics and doesn't exaggerate it. The characters develop in their personality. For example it was nice to see Tod talking to Garry when he needed a man in his life. This adds more depth to Tod's character and shows how there are moments when young boys need a man to help them out, even if he is not much older and mature as one would expect. The ending with the roller coaster metaphor is pretty clever and sums up the movie and the idea on how life is better very well. It was presented to us by grandma who was very well portrayed by Helen Shaw. It is interesting how she started acting pretty late in life and doesn't have that many credits but was really good. Although since I don't know much about her, maybe she did some stage acting before.I sure recommend it to people. I guess it may appeal even more to people who have kids since they deal with parenthood themselves. But even as a child free person I loved the movie.",Parenthood
7,michaelRokeefe,The joys of raising kids. It isn't easy.,6,15 June 2007,"Director Ron Howard co-writes this salute to parenthood. A heartwarming comedy that sneaks in the drama of being a parent and a grandparent. Parenthood can be thankless and like a battlefield. Gil(Steve Martin)and Karen Buckman(Mary Steenburgen)face every possible emotion and situation that comes with raising children. The story line features a college drop-out, a perplexed single mom and a high-toned couple dealing with an overachiever. And Jason Robards represents the older generation. The cast also features the apt talents of: Dianne Wiest, Rick Moranis, Martha Plimpton, Joaquin Phoenix, Keanu Reeves and Tom Hulce. Martin and Wiest were outstanding. On the other hand, I found Hulce just plain irritating. PARENTHOOD is to not be compared to a self-help book.",Parenthood

9,Boba_Fett1138,Excellent mix of comedy and drama.,9,2 May 2006,"This might very well be the most balanced- and excellent mix of drama and comedy I have ever seen. I already loved ""Parenthood"" when I was a kid and I perhaps love it even more now as a grownup, when I recently watched it again.Perhaps the greatest strength of this movie is in its realism. Sure every character and event in the movie are somewhat silly and over-the-top but yet they also feel like very real problems and persons at the same time. This due to the great portrayal of the drama elements in the movie. These are real, recognizable or not, family-issues portrayed in this movie. It handles some delicate subjects but never without a smile as well. It makes this movie both touching and warm to watch, as well as fun and amusing.Reason why both the dramatic and comical elements all work so well is also thanks to the cast. The movie has many well known actors in it. Tom Hulce especially impressed me and also Steve Martin was a great leading man, from the period when he was still funny in movies. Solid as always were Mary Steenburgen and Dianne Wiest. Rick Moranis surprisingly doesn't play a loser this time but he still is a nutty character in the movie. He shows in this movie that he also has some real acting skills. Keanu Reeves is also good in his role, from the period when he appeared mostly in just comedies. The still very young Joaquin Phoenix also plays a great and quite big role in the movie.It has some totally unforgettable moments in it, both comedy-wise as in its drama. It all makes this movie one of the most warm and subtle movies ever made. It doesn't try to be funny, it doesn't try to be melodramatic. The end result of it all is an extremely well balanced and crafted mix of drama and comedy that works on both levels. You can watch this movie as a drama or as a comedy, so fans of both the genre will be pleased with this movie that surely does not disappoint in any way.An early subtle Ron Howard masterpiece, that is criminally underrated here on IMDb.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Parenthood
10,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,True,8,15 November 2009,"They don't make 'em like this anymore. Not in Hollywood, and in general not enough. I hope that regular people will eventually stop going to the exaggerated ""comedies"", where we're supposed to laugh at humiliation, pain and things so absurd that we can't relate to them, only remain at a distance from them. It's the only way this kind of picture will be made again. This touches upon just about every single issue that a family of today can face, save for the extreme cases(you know, the ones that are treated in talk-shows). It all feels incredible genuine, and we can understand everything that goes on and become emotionally involved in it. The jokes and gags are often hilarious, and this doesn't take the material from the serious subjects. Instead, it comes from situations that we can recognize or imagine finding ourselves in, none of it comes from taking away someone's dignity, and it doesn't at any point try too hard. Every single character is a human being, a person, no one is there merely to be ridiculed. The acting is spot-on, every single performance. Martin and Reeves use their respective schticks some. Even the children are convincing. Howard directs it all beautifully, and there is not a single time where you're unsure if the intent is to be funny or to be dramatic and affect the audience. There is a bit of mild to moderate language, and sex is talked about in pretty strong detail(little is shown, however). I recommend this to everyone mature enough for it. 8/10",Parenthood
11,evanston_dad,Excellent Ron Howard Film (If Such a Thing Is Possible),8,4 September 2008,"Ron Howard has been directing such deadly bores for so long now that it's easy to forget he once showed promise. During the 1980s, he made his best films, because he wasn't trying to make them IMPORTANT. First came ""Splash,"" an utterly winning comedy that made a star out of Tom Hanks, and then ""Parenthood,"" a well-written ensemble dramedy about navigating the tricky waters of child rearing that features a fantastic cast.Steve Martin and Mary Steenburgen anchor the film as the grounded, reliable married couple at the film's center, with much of the comedy being supplied by Dianne Wiest, playing Martin's sister, and Rick Moranis, playing his type-A brother-in-law. Wiest especially steals the show as a divorcée at her wit's end trying desperately to keep her wild child daughter (Martha Plimpton) and recluse son (a young Joaquin Phoenix) in check.The film also features Tom Hulce, excellent as yet a fourth sibling with a gambling addiction, and the expert Jason Robards, as the tyrannical family patriarch.The film is episodic in nature, full of beautifully realized individual moments. The only thing I could have done without is Randy Newman's atrocious theme song.Grade: A",Parenthood
12,HotToastyRag,"Heavy, realistic family drama",8,11 September 2019,"As the title suggests, Parenthood isn't a movie for anyone who hasn't had his or her life ruined-I mean, blessed by children. If you've never been a parent, there's just no way for you to fully appreciate this movie. Sure, you'll laugh at Mary Steenburgen trying to spice up her marriage by giving her husband a treat while they're driving, and you'll identify with the family competition between Rick Moranis's and Steve Martin's marriages, but you won't really get the sacrifice, disappointment, and endless attempts to improve someone's life even when you know it's futile. Those come with parenthood.Parenthood is the only movie that not only do I not dislike Jason Robards in, but I freely bestow praise on his performance. He's the patriarch of the family, with four struggling children and seven struggling grandchildren. Steve Martin and his wife Mary Steenburgen feel strapped and trapped with three kids, and Steve finds himself falling into the cliché of becoming the one person he resented growing up: his father. Dianne Wiest is divorced and can't relate to her teenaged kids. Harley Kozak seems to have the perfect marriage with Rick Moranis, but they're hiding their problems and taking their frustration out in different ways. Tom Hulce is Jason's favorite, but he's easily seen by the audience as a loser. Among all the children, Tom puts Jason through the most grief-isn't that typical?If you watch the preview, this Ron Howard flick is marketed as a comedy. It's not a comedy! This is a serious family comedy rife with disappointments, frustrations, and the inability to communicate with people who are supposed to love you. This is pretty heavy, so depending on the relationship you have with your own parents or children, or where you are in the stage of your life, you might not even get through it.",Parenthood
13,Aaron1375,Took itself way to seriously.,3,4 April 2003,"This movie looked really funny in the trailers...I found, however, that most of the funnier scenes were already shown in the trailers show there wasn't much else to see.  All the funny stuff happens within the first 10 or so minutes into this one and after that there are just one or two more laughs scattered here and there.  For the most part I found this movie way to serious, and it wasn't entertaining to me.  I can see how others can relate to it, but I am a single guy with no kids or girlfriend...so I cannot really relate to it.  If you are a parent though it might be worth your while to ignore this review and go ahead and watch the movie.",Parenthood
14,namashi_1,Entertaining....,6,28 April 2010,"Ron Howard is amongst the best in the business, he's a legend! So any film of his sets new expectations and hype, his 1989 Super-hit 'Parenthood' is a yet another feather in his well-decorated cap. It's not a Killer film, but surely a good one-time watch.'Parenthood' talks about a family, a big family, The Buckman's, of which each have a certain problem going-on. It talks about how a Parent should behave with his lad, it talks about relationships. It's a film that has it's heart at the right place. Howard's direction is amazing, yet again. Donald McAlpine's Camera-Work also caught my attention, his job is good.In the acting department, Dianne Wiest steals the show. She's fantastic from start to end. Mary Steenburgen is another topper, she's exceptional. Steve Martin is okay. Rick Moranis and Tom Hulce are not in form this time around, both look restless and least interested in the goings-on. Keanu Reeves is awkward. Others are fine in their parts.On the whole, Watch this one... it will entertain you.",Parenthood
15,Smells_Like_Cheese,The joys of Parenthood,10,1 January 2007,"I babysit a lot and when my cousins have pulled pranks, I go home crying to my mom about how hard it is to handle them sometimes and she laughs at me and says ""Wait 'till it's 24-7"", 'cause I would like to have 3 kids one day. I think we all forget that our parents are people too every once in a while and I ask my mom and dad how they did it, but they always tell me there is no book to raising a child, you just have to do the best you can and Parenthood is a comedic and sometimes serious interpretation of what all parents go through in the greatest and scariest times of their kid's lives.We go through four siblings: Gil, played by Steve, who is trying so hard to be the perfect dad to his four children, but finds it to be too much than he expected. Larry, played by Tom, who can't seem to grow up and accept his responsibility to be a dad. Helen, played by Dianne, who has rebellious kids and she's a single mom learning how to handle her high school married daughter. And Julie, played by Martha, who's husband, played by Rick, won't stop taking over their daughter's possible fun childhood by stuffing her head with information she won't need until Harvard Law School.Parenthood is a terrific movie that really shows how hard it is to be a parent, but the terrific rewards that come with it. Not to mention that there is great humor to it as well, but it was so realistically portrayed that anyone could get into this film. If you are a parent or daughter or son, this is the movie to watch. It really is a great film and the cast just brought so much to over all a terrific film.10/10",Parenthood
16,MovieAddict2016,Those expecting silly slapstick humor will be disappointed.,8,9 May 2005,"The first time I saw ""Parenthood"" some number of years ago I hated it. I expected what was promised on the cover -- a silly slapstick-style comedy. Instead I got some sappy Ron Howard family drama with barely any laughs at all -- a serious film in the guise of a ""comedy."" However on second viewing I didn't have any preconceptions about what the film was going to be and as a result I enjoyed it far, far more. I was surprised at the level of maturity there WAS in the film; how well it balances the realistic family situations while remaining quite humorous.From the onset it's clear the film has a very dry ironic sense of humor -- adult, actually. The scene with Martin in the body of a child talking to the hot dog vendor at a ball game is classic stuff and a superb example of the style in this movie.Rick Moranis is really funny as the first-time father whose daughter is treated like Little Jack in ""Meet the Fockers"" -- he plays her classical music, teaches her advanced mathematics and grammar, and refrains her from playing with other children. The scene where Martin pretends to pull his thumb off and she freaks out is very good.Overall ""Parenthood"" will disappoint you if you're expecting a laugh-out-loud slapstick comedy. However if you want something a bit deeper and more poignant than your average Steve Martin comedy, this is a good example of how well Martin is at starring as ""straight characters"" and an honest examination of parenthood.",Parenthood
17,lasttimeisaw,dated placebo to the difficulties of parenting,4,7 June 2014,"What leads me to watch this film is Dianne Wiest's singular Oscar-nomination, how rare a mainstream comedy stars Steve Martin could generate an Oscar-caliber performance? Is it as wackily diverting as Marisa Tomei in MY COUSIN VINNY (1992, 7/10) or a rowdy and raunchy scene-stealer as Melissa McCarthy in BRIDESMAIDS (2011, 7/10)? Neither is the case here, thus the answer could only be that it is Academy's honeymoon period with Wiest, who has just won an Oscar 3 years earlier for Woody Allen's HANNAH AND HER SISTERS (1986, 8/10) and would harvest her second trophy pretty soon in another Allen's satire BULLETS OVER Broadway (1994, 8/10).However, skimming through the credits, it is a quite impressive ensemble here, besides Wiest, there are Oscar winners Steenburgen and Robards, the flash-in-the-pan Oscar nominee Tom Hulce with future leading man Keanu Reeves and Joaquin Phoenix, the burn-too-soon starlet Martha Plimpton, and it is directed by Ron Howard to boot, chances are the film might be more than a crowd-pleasing family fare, and again, I am so wrong!It is a big family, its patriarch Frank (Robards) has four children, the eldest Helen (Wiest), a divorcée with two children, the adolescent Julie (Plimpton) and the introvert teenager Garry (Phoenix); Gil (Martin) is the second, he and his wife Karen (Steenburgen) have 3 children, among whom Kevin (Fisher) is a school-kid has some mood issues and needs special treatment; Susan (Kozak) is the youngest daughter, married to Nathan (Moranis), they have one girl Patty (Schwan), who is under Nathan's unconventional upbringing method and on her fast lane to become a child prodigy; the most problematic one is the youngest son Larry (Hulce), a black sheep in the family, a ne'er-do-well addicts to gambling. Spoiler alert, this is not the end, the family is keeping expanding as if it is a blatant advertisement of unprotected sex. Not exactly an out-and-out comedy, the film sums up a menagerie of headaches of being a parent, all are laboriously entwined in a cumbersome plot, and even though, in the end, everyone is still fearlessly riding on the way to make babies, yeah, being a parent is sometimes irritating, but you know what, no one can escape that, 3 is never enough, 4 might be better, even though he or she may end up being a jerk like Larry. It might be edifying 25 years ago (low birth rate in the state I assume), but now, it seems shamelessly narrow-minded and self- pleasingly irresponsible, we don't buy that now, not everyone suits to be a parent, it is a demanding job and should need a certificate, paraphrasing the dimwitted Tod (Reeves) who expresses the most incisive remark which should be legitimized so that there will be far less lousy parents in the world. On a whole, the film doesn't age well, its content feels uneasily predictable, most of time it persists in stating the obvious and plugging a unified American lifestyle, the cast is inequitable, Martin, Steenburgen, Wiest and Robards all have their moments from time to time, but Hulce and Moranis are tainted by the crappy script. Even grandma's sensible credo (roller coaster Vs. merry-go-around) sounds jarringly self-important near the end, anyway, not my cup-of-tea, period.",Parenthood

Along with Dianne Wiest, Rick Moranis, Jason Robards, Mary Steenburgen, Tom Hulce, Martha Plimpton, Keanu Reeves and a very, very young Joaquin Phoenix!!The entire movie was filmed in Orlando in 1989 and was a highly publicized movie in 1989. Filmed around the Orlando area I remember the houses used in the movie, as well the baseball fields, the Publix, the schools and Orlando Speedway. Part of it was even filmed at the University of Florida.The movie is not with out sin, there are several scenes which could have been better, but overall it is an enjoyable movie.

20,videorama-759-859391,"Wonderful comedy, where underneath, lies many a drama",9,22 November 2014,"Parenthood is a great movie, in the fact, it addresses many issues of parenting we can identify with, it's sort of like a couple of episodes of a family drama, combined, but is wonderfully told in a near two hour film. The performances are great, even Reeves, as another sort of layabout, sponging boyfriend living with girlfriend (Plympton) in her mum's house. The mum, played by Dianne Wiest is such a likable character, but one I could identify with, as it's a very real character, resembling mother's I've met. We see the attitudes from all walks of people, the so common, and real problems that can't be brushed under the carpet, like Steve Martin's little boy, struck with mental illness. I liked the well drawn and different character of Hulce's as an addictive gambler. An interesting angle. He's so bloody convincing, I just now realized where is he these days? He comes back home, cause some bad dudes are after him, while later, would you believe, he pulls his Dad (the great Jason Robards) into one of his schemes. We really see how this addictions got him. There's so many wonderful performances where the film never dulls, as we go from one conflict to another, back and forth.

22,Spleen,Irresponsible propaganda,4,30 January 2001,"Is it REALLY a good idea to make a lavish, multi-million-dollar, two-hour ad persuading people to have kids?  Persuading people who already have three kids to have another one?  ""Let's make like they're doughnuts, and have a dozen,"" says Steve Martin sarcastically - but Martin and fellow comic Rick Moranis are in the unfortunate position of being trapped in a movie in which nobody, not even the director, takes any notice of them when they're saying something that runs counter to the message they were hired to preach. Moranis and Martin are voices of sanity, and the most sympathetic people present.  But the script keeps betraying them.Moranis plays Nathan Merrick, a father who wants his daughter to be an only child for at least five years - because this increases her chances of being intelligent and capable, and may even help her become a genius.  His wife is opposed to this plan.  Why?  Because, she snaps, their daughter is ""not some PRODUCT!""  -Okay, cheap retorts aside, why is she opposed to this plan? Because she wants another child, NOW.  Since the film is set in some weird kind of Catholic universe, in which any kind of procreative restraint is a sin, she gets her way.There's a scene that's meant to be amusing - to be fair, it IS amusing - in which Nathan is teaching his daughter the names of the elements while Mozart is being played in the background.  -Well, why not?  Mozart himself was a child prodigy who grew up on a healthy diet of Haydn; so was Beethoven. Anyone born today with the capacity to become as great would choke on The Wiggles, or some such.  Active steps are needed to prevent this.  Good on Nathan, I say.But this is a side issue.  The film's central goal is to persuade us - you, me, and everyone else - to go forth and multiply.  Pay no attention to the fact most of the film's running time is devoted to the down side of procreating.  It never looks at this down side very closely; and anyway, it's all a cunning ploy.  At the end, everyone has a spanking new baby, and they all look so HAPPY.  (Even an uncoupled widower who's ancestor to over half the cast already and who may even be old enough to be infertile finds himself saddled with a fresh kid.  What hope is there for the rest of us?)It's the roller coaster story that does it.  Don't ask about the roller coaster story.  I can't bring myself to repeat it.  ""A minute ago I was so CONFUSED about life.  Then Grandma came along with her roller coaster story, and now, everything's okay!""  When Steve Martin says this he's being sarcastic, but the sarcasm is only Ron Howard's way of disguising the fact that this really is what we're meant to think.  (Steve Martin is, as usual, funny, but on the whole he needed better jokes.  It's a shame.  Martin the performer is talented in at least three ways: he can act, he can be hilarious, and he can save weak material when nobody else in the world can. We've seen him at work on that third thing too often.)Ron Howard is far from being a great director, but when he made ""Parenthood"" he was clearly at his best.  A pity he chose that moment, of all moments, to preach.  And the sermon he chose could hardly have been more ill-judged.P.S.:  The title really ought to have been ""Fatherhood"".  Even the one female-heavy plot strand (he Lampkins saga) was as much concerned with fathers as with mothers.  Not that I'm complaining - the film is over two hours long as it is.  If, for every father, there had been an equally prominent mother ... well, let's just be grateful that there isn't.",Parenthood
23,Kamurai25,"Parenthood's a mess, enjoy.",6,10 June 2020,"Decent watch, probably won't watch again, but could recommend.Sometimes its good to get in the way back machine and see movies that really drove today's tropes, like the ""crazy dysfunctional big family"" trope.Steve Martin is always fun, if a little weird in this at times.This feels more like just a representation of how hard parenting can be because all people, including children, are different and have different wants and needs.Its a fun little adventure of a movie, but not much re-watchability.",Parenthood
24,PredragReviews,"He Likes to ""butt"" things with his head! ""How proud you must be!""",9,12 November 2016,"One of Ron Howard's earliest and most endearing cinema masterpieces. The movie tackles its title with tongue firmly planted in cheek and hits a bulls eye with almost every scene. The cast is to die for and their comedy timing under the sure hand of a situation comedy pro (does anyone question Opie's credentials in that regard???) like Ron Howard is bound to make merry mirth of marriage and kids. Look for a very early performance by Keanu Reeves. The great Jason Robards lets his hair down here a bit and Rick Moranis is a hoot. But of course, my heart is with Mary Steenburgen, my one true crush though out the eighties! She holds it all together (with much more than a little help from Diane Wiest as I recall). This movie's all-star cast does a remarkable job of portraying both the triumphs and the heartaches of being both a parent and a kid with very little sugar-coating added to make it go down easy. It let's you know that sometimes you've ""won"" if you just get to the end of the day in one piece. The best part about this movie is that I am sure it will put your own life in perspective when it comes to whether you are doing the ultimate ""job"" life has to offer right. ""Parenthood"" is a laugh-out-loud look at the perils and rewards of family. Everyone will recognize someone they know in the imperfect children, crazy relatives, and inevitable dysfunctional family member. The film's charm is its familiarity. And it's nice to see characters that don't react to every disappointment by trying to control everyone involved. The writing is sharp and witty, the editing perfect, and the acting superb.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Parenthood
25,jellopuke,Funny and relatable,7,22 February 2018,"If you've got kids, you'll see so much here that rings true. It's the kind of movie they don't make anymore, ""real"" situations, not high-concept, ensemble casts that have actual characters to work with, and an attempt at showing life instead of fantasy. 
Some of this doesn't hold up almost 30 years later since the whole thing is devoid of anyone who isn't white and middle class (saving the boy Cool) and it reeks of Reagan era propaganda encouraging the making of more babies, but you can overlook that because the moments themselves are real. 
Saw this as a kid and had that diarrhea song stuck in my head for days... it all came back!",Parenthood
26,oneguyrambling,Cowboy Gil. Gowboy Gil. Cowboy Gil. COWBOY GIL!,7,3 February 2012,"Parenthood follows the everyday trials and tribulations of up to 5 generations of the Buckman family, the centrepiece of which is Gil (Steve Martin) – in the film at least.Gil wants to be a better Dad than his own father (Jason Robards), than the well meaning but domineering Nathan (Rick Moranis), the negligent and unreliable Larry (Tom Hulce) and the non-existent former spouse of his sister Helen (Dianne Wiest) who has run out on his two teenage children. But Gil and wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen), as every couple, have their own problems with career demands, family issues and 3 young kids with their own idiosyncrasies and developmental problems.As you might guess the cast is quite stellar and probably wouldn't be possible in this day and age of inflated salaries and egos, Parenthood isn't so much an 'event film' as one which shows the various generations dealing with raising kids of various ages in their own ways.Some of the occurrences and developments in the film are quite serious in tone but obviously dealt with in amusing fashion. While teenage angst, sex and domineering parents might seem like easy targets for comedy they also manage to squeeze a chuckle or two from broken and breaking relationships and neglectful parents.The entire cast does well at providing carefully rendered characters, Steve Martin as always provides the deadpan laughs, the exception being the immortal kid's birthday party scene where he is allowed to run wild and crazy as Cowboy Gil the most amusing party entertainment on film.Hulce is unlikable as the fast talking deadbeat Larry – which is the point, and Weist is very good as the downtrodden and almost desperate single Mum Helen trying to juggle 2 growing kids and a moronic live in boyfriend/husband to her daughter played by Keanu Reeves, who at the time was still embracing his doofus image.It's hard to talk about Parenthood in more detail, the humour is created through the low key realistic situations and how those going through them deal with them. Aside from the Cowboy Gil scene there aren't too many laugh out loud moments but there are numerous chuckles to be had and the film quite accurately proves what Robards' character says near the end; 'once you start you never stop being a parent'.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Memorable and worthwhile, if not classic. Parenthood has dated quite well in 20 plus years and remains as relevant and amusing today.",Parenthood
27,ODDBear,Thoroughly enjoyable comedy drama,8,7 April 2006,"Parenthood is a thoroughly enjoyable comedy drama that you feel doesn't take as many convenient short cuts as many family movies do. Everyone has a colorful family to some extent; most (I hope) are full of good natured people but there are always rotten apples floating around.Director Ron Howard puts many lives on display and different challenges each one faces and every one of these inspections have something to offer. Steve Martin's reactions to his older son's adjustment problems are very well realized, with many humorous moments, to be sure, but at the core is a maturely handled and moving segment, and Martin has rarely been better.Diane Wiest's family drama consists of her inability to communicate properly to her two teenage children; the daughter a temperamental rebel with a ""loser"" boyfriend, the son a nearly recluse loner with raging hormones who thinks something is wrong with him (what guy hasn't been there at least once?). Superb performances form Wiest and (yes, surprisingly) Keanu Reeves really fuel this story which never loses itself despite seeing many humorous aspects in a rather depressing household.Jason Robards plays the family father who hasn't been all that good to his children since...well ever, and he faces a tough assignment when he has to admit to himself that one of his children, who has learned the most from him, is heading into disaster fast. The scene where he asks Steve Martin for advice is a moving scene in so many ways; it's never too late for an old dog to learn new tricks.Rick Moranis's tale of his insanely intellectual daughter is my least favorite but it does have a very charming conclusion. And that granny is priceless.Parenthood may be even better for those who have children and can identify with some situations depicted here but as for me, I think I can learn a thing or two for years to come.",Parenthood
28,sharky_55,"If she's so brilliant, why is she sitting in our neighbour's car?",9,1 July 2016,"Parenthood sees so clearly and honestly into the lives of no less than four generations of a sprawling family that each have their own various anxieties about life. The script, without ever managing to be messy or overly ambitious, deftly navigates their issues and gives each character the weight and attention they deserve. From here, Howard allows for the story lines to overlap and influence each other so that we can see exactly how the issues of parenthood differ from generation to generation. One core theme is the struggle between chasing your dreams and settling for a boring, monotonous office job that will pay the bills. Frank sees the two sides in his sons, and we see the effects of him babying and favouring one and being hard on another. Larry (the baby-faced Tom Hulce) has returned with yet another of his get rich quick schemes, and though he wears the persona of a hard, self-made man, the softer father in Frank cannot resist given him one more chance (as he has already done so many times in the past). But the film is also clever enough to not draw him as a complete pushover. When Larry once again proposes to skip town for a couple of months, we realise that he was never truly in mortal danger. And perhaps Frank knows this too, despite his everlasting affection for a son who has never held a stable job. This is why his character is wise enough to not to offer the money up front but set up an instalment plan, even as he knows what answer is coming. The film speaks so truly because it builds the lives of these parents and children and then looks for the comedy within, instead of the other way around. When Helen discovers sexually explicit photos of her daughter with the unapproved boyfriend, she is ready to explode, but does not do so overtly. She goes through a series of processes - first sarcasm, with a bit of underhand humour, as if she is almost trying to will the tricky situation away. Then she projects her emotions onto her son (""You've upset your brother!"") which easily betrays her fears of her already disjointed family falling further into disarray. This elicits a laugh because Garry is in that particular phase where one-word deadpan answers are the norm and he doesn't show even the slightest bit of concern. Then finally Helen levels with the hyperbolic threats of no return that many parents will utter at some time or another, but nearly never mean it. Weist makes this hilarious because no more than a split second later she is spilling out and regretting her outburst and embarrassingly revealing her concern for all the neighbours to hear. This is very funny, but also very true, and the film combines the two flawlessly. And the transitions are timed well - this scenes is followed almost immediately by a teary Julie who has broken it off with Tod, and when Karen decides to try out an idea of Susan's, the cut to the aftermath is telling. Gil Buckman is the one most under fire. He is caught in that relentless dad trap between the job and his kids, and is fully aware. Refreshingly, he is not the usual bumbling father that the poster would suggest. The film's great strength is that it does not throw these tensions between work and family as if they were merely contrived scenes from a screenplay designed to bring about an effect. Gil knows the potential stigmas associated with Kevin, is firmly against mimicking his own distant father, and puts in real, visible effort to form a bond and protect his son. The narrative does not yank his agency from the floor under him and create wacky, zany antics from improbably situations. So this builds the penultimate moment. Gil fumes and fumes and fumes on the unlucky timing of Karen's pregnancy and how it will throw the already precarious balance between his work and home into further chaos. And then he finally realises that if he can experience that brief spark of laughter and joy after a pop-up catch just once more, he would gladly go through another roller-coaster ride.",Parenthood

Ron Howard has created a masterpiece and it is possibly Steve Martins finest moment. His turn as Cowboy Dan makes me hoot!! Parenthood speaks to anyone that has kids or is part of a family. It can make one cry (Leaf Phoenix,now known as Joaquin, as Gary calling his absent father) and it makes one laugh out loud (Steve Martin as Cowboy Dan). The performances from the adult actors and the child actors are uniformly great-a special mention for the kid who plays Justin and Dianne Weist is fantastic. I am always disappointed when it finishes as, unlike other reviewers have said, this movie is not long enough for me.It says a lot about relationships within families and between parents and their children-whether actual kids or grown up progeny. I have introduced several people to this film and never has anyone said they did not really enjoy it. It has universal truths and speaks to any parent.

We have detours for many typical scenarios in America with some comedic moments, others are Rock Morinic, with a few poignant moments keeping the focus on the worthiness of a family life. Ron Howard and gang assembled a potent cast but went for absolute mass appeal in the face of divorce, contraception, puberty, gambling, irresponsible parenting, the blame game and life long grudges. It could have added up to more that the saccharine sweet ending we got. saw it as a single person when it came out and now on DVD as a Parent and it never managed to actually shed any light with the exception of Jason Robards who carries the message and I believe if involved more could have squeezed more juice out of this.

Set around an extended family's goings on; four siblings' families go through divorce, separation, genius children issues, dysfunctional children, teen pregnancy and seemingly inappropriate relationships, adolescence gone awry, loneliness and sexual frustration, senile dementia, unemployment and gambling addiction. A funny, touching and inspirational film with quite a few iconic truisms. It is gentle comedy, but laugh out loud in places, and has something for everyone.

I can take Steve Martin only for so much as he can be so extreme in his range of emotions that it really gets on my nerve a little. But here I had to make allowance and he really turns an astonishing performance. The whole thing feels so close to home it's hard not to be involved. I have watched this movie many times over the years, and every time I too ride its roller coaster as it goes, almost as if I had not seen it before.

Well-crafted and competent, the gentle pace and mild comedy will keep you amused rather than excited, interested rather than engrossed in the lives of people who are quickly forgotten once the final credits have rolled.Robards is easily the pick of the bunch, not that he's remotely challenged here. Martin plays down the slapstick and is all the better for it. Wiest & Steenburgen add to his slushiness & sentimentality. Keanu just carried on where he left off with Ted, but he shares a few good scenes with a young Joaquin Phoenix. Moranis doesn't shine, and Plimpton doesn't get a chance too - which is a shame because she shows great potential.It's a good example of it's type and I don't regret watching it, but I wouldn't ever want to watch it again.

44,Gideon24,A warm family comedy with a first rate all-star cast,8,12 December 2015,"Director Ron Howard nailed family dysfunction and the difficulties of parenting with a warm and entertaining 1989 comedy called Parenthood.This episodic comedy centers on the Buckman family, led by one Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) and his wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen), who serve as the centerpiece for a dysfunctional family that includes Gil's hard-drinking father (Jason Robards), who took Gil to baseball games as a child and used to leave him alone and pay ushers to watch him. Dianne Wiest plays Gil's divorced sister, Helen, who is the mother of two teenagers, one a horny high-schooler (Martha Plimpton) sleeping with her boyfriend (Keanu Reeves) and the other (Joaquin Phoenix) wants to live with his father.Tom Hulce plays the proverbial black sheep brother who has returned home with an illegitimate son and a get rich quick plan. Rick Moranis is effectively cast against type as a stuffed shirt married to Gil's other sister (Harley Kozack) who is raising his toddler like she's a sophomore in college.The screenplay by longtime Howard collaborators Lowell Ganz and Babloo Mandel might play like an extended sitcom, but it is a very entertaining one, that provides consistent laughs without sacrificing realism or realistic situations. The screenplay is insightful and clever and well-served by Howard's hand-picked cast, who give uniformly fine performances down the line, with a standout performance from Wiest that earned her an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.Thanks to a smart screenplay, sensitive direction, some offbeat casting, and some fun performances, this is a very special comedy that got by a lot of people but is worth checking out.

45,richspenc,Funny and interesting with a dose of reality,8,14 May 2017,"I found the first scene to be quite interesting and original. We see an 8 year old kid at the baseball stadium being looked after by an usher while his dad's walked off to do some sort of business. The kid starts talking like a sophisticated adult and the usher says he's not talking like a kid. The kid reveals he's really 35 and that he's just reliving a point of his childhood at the ballparks when his dad took him there and left him with ushers while going off to conduct business. He tells the usher he's really an algarhythm, a combination of different ushers he knew as a kid melded together in his memory. We then cut to the present with Steve Martin at the ballpark with his family. The whole thing was a playing in Steve's mind and memories. The scene was kind of a cool mind trick for the audience. I liked that. Then on the way home from the park with Steve, his wife Mary Steenburg, and his kids, one of the kids sings ""if you're sliding into first and you feel something burst..."" me and my school buddies all thought it was hilarious when I saw it the first time as a kid, even though he skipped the second base verse. And the kid said he learned it at camp, which I remember from being a kid was always the typical place for kids to learn things like that. The movie isn't just about Steve's immediate family. It's about the extended family and 4 sets of parents. Well one is just the mother, Diane Wiest due to the dad abandoned them. Diane's 14 year old son (Joaquin Phoenix) and 17 year old daughter Martha Plimpton both have pretty serious problems. Joaquin is reclusive and antisocial, hides things (adult tapes) from his mom (she was worried because she thought it might be drugs) in a paper bag he keeps carrying around, and he has a lot of anger and hurt towards his dad for abandoning them. Martha is bratty, always has her boyfriend (Keanu Reeves) sneaking into her room, she runs away at one point, and eventually ends up pregnant. Rick Moranis and his fiancée Harley Kozak have a gifted two year old girl who is constantly having her dad teaching her words through advanced flash cards. Rick and Harley have trust issues in their relationship. Steve's dad Jason Robards and Steve's brother Larry live together with Larry getting tied up in shady money making schemes to where he not only gets into serious debt, but has gangsters after him due to him owing them 5 figures. Larry attempts but is caught trying to steal his dad's antique car so he can pay them back. Larry has a son named Cool. Cool. (lol)Steve's dad and he have had abandonment issues also and don't see eye to eye. There were heavy drama scenes in this film such as dealing with the pregnancy and dealing with abandonment, and Joaquin smashes up his walked out dad's dentist office. Steve has issues with his son having a learning disability, and behavior issues such as when he loses his retainer at a restaurant. There were funny scenes such as Steve and Mary's reason for their fender bender, and Diane's reaction to receiving the ""wrong"" photos of Martha and Keanu. And there were heartwarming scenes such as Steve posing as a cowboy for his son's birthday party (due to a funny mix up where the company accidentally sends a stripper to the kid's party and the cowboy to the adult bachelor party), and Rick singing ""Close to you"" to Harley in front of her classroom. And I liked grandma and her roller-coaster story. And I wonder if Steve Martin and the film makers of this movie could see into the future. After learning Mary is pregnant again, Steve is upset because of how it'll mean more work than he can handle. He sarcastically says ""why don't we then just have another kid, and then another! Why don't we go for a dozen kids and call them donuts!"" That comment mirrors Steve's future 2003 movie ""Cheaper by the dozen"" when he really is the parent of a dozen kids.",Parenthood
46,pontifikator,A movie for grownups to see and laugh at themselves,7,24 September 2010,"This is a very good movie. Apparently Lowell Ganz, Babaloo Mandel, and Ron Howard got together and came up with the idea and story, then Ganz and Mandel did the screenplay, and Howard directed. The cast is excellent. Remember this is a 1989 movie: you'll see Keanu Reeves before anyone knew who he was, Joaquin Phoenix before he knew who he was, Steve Martin, Mary Steenburgen, Dianne Wiest, Jason Robards, Rick Moranis, Tom Hulce, Rance Howard (Ron's father), Clint Howard (Ron's brother), and Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's sister) (and you still don't know who they are). The gist of the movie is that Gil Buckman (played by Steve Martin) and his wife Karen (Mary Steenburgen) have three young kids, and they're driving them crazy. Now let me point out that ""they"" and ""them"" are indefinite pronouns with no clear antecedent. I'll clear that up for you. The kids are driving the parents crazy and vice versa. The pressure is on little Kevin to do well in school and on the baseball diamond, and the pressure is on Gil to do well at work, which means less time at home. Rivalry among Gil's siblings is rampant, driven by a sociopathic old man (Robards in a sometimes intense role as Frank Buckman) who favors one child among his four.The movie still works today, a testament to the screenplay, the direction, and the cast. It's full enough of laughs to qualify as a comedy, but there are some serious issues going on in the movie where we have lives of not-so-quiet desperation. I hadn't seen the movie since it came out, and I remembered it as good; however, I saw it recently and it was better than I remembered. The ensemble acting is very good. Hulce was excellent as Frank's wayward son Larry. Hulce showed that Larry's manipulation of the old man was built on genuine fondness and regard, exceeded only by Larry's narcissism and need for his dad's love and respect. This is the first role I noticed Dianne Wiest in, and she knocked my socks off. I think she was the best actor in the movie. Keanu Reeves showed his talent clearly in his role as the would-be boyfriend of Wiest's daughter (played by Martha Plimpton).Don't worry about the plot. There's not so much a story arch as a series of scenes for the characters to muddle through; it all ends with happiness, everyone having muddled through.

47,Chromium_5,One of my personal favorites...,9,22 November 2003,"""Parenthood"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I am almost 18 years old, and I know I will probably relate to this movie more if I ever have children myself, but even now I can see what a great job it does showing the different aspects of what it is like to be a parent.What I like most about this movie is how it shows various types of families, and in each one, the parent is trying hard to do a good job. Some of the characters are good parents, and some aren't, but they all have good intentions. In some places the movie goes pretty deep, especially the way it depicts Garry, a kid who has serious self-esteem issues because he has no father and is always hearing his mom and sister talking about how they hate men.But don't think this movie is all sappy and emotional. It's touching, but it is also very, very funny. Steve Martin is one of the funniest guys on the planet, and he is truly hilarious in this movie (especially in the ""Cowboy Gil"" scene). Rick Moranis is great, too. It is a funny movie that does an excellent job showing what parenthood is like. If you haven't seen it, you really should. I give it 9 out of 10 ten stars.",Parenthood

49,kaaber-2,Not just a movie - (mild spoiler),10,20 March 2011,"because beneath the humor of the truly brilliant script, layer upon layer of a highly philosophical take on the post-68 family structure unfold (which is subtly hinted at in Helen's ""I was at Woodstock, for gosh sake!"") and almost every line serves as the headline of some deeply-rooted problem in modern co-existence. Without feeling force-fed or lectured, we are presented with every conceivable angle of dysfunctional family life, from Robards' negligent father figure to the neurotically duty-obsessed Steve Martin (""My whole life is 'have to'!""). It is one of those gems that tend to get truer, the more you watch it. The acting is flawless all the way through, but in the final analysis, the true genius of the film lies in the script. And then it's so wonderfully unassuming! It strikes me as being one of those films like ""The Apartment,"" which seem like comedies the first time you see them, but veer still more towards tragedy with each time they're revisited. I forget the name of the space capsule that contained a message to whichever aliens we wanted to inform about human life on the planet Earth, but in any case: ""Parenthood"" is the film I would put on board.

50,ToldYaSo,Seeing a film with new eyes,8,9 May 1999,"When I first saw ""Parenthood"", in 1989, I was 18. I thought it was entertaining and funny, and didn't give it much thought beyond that.Being a parent was not in my immediate horizon. But I still managed to hold some idealistic views on how it should be done, and thinking that if I could just get the role of being a good father right, and if that was all I could do properly, then my life would be worth something extraordinary. My friends thought I was strange, and I thought I knew what I was talking about.It's ten years later, and being a parent is a very realistic possibility and it seems to be the next big life decision. We already have a house and a cat, which means there's only one forward move left.This film now scares me more than ""Alien"" or ""The Exorcist"". The film's tagline, ""It could happen to you,"" is terrifying. They're right. It could. It probably will, even. My wife and I are at a crucial stage in our lives where more than just the biological clock is ticking; it feels like a race against time itself to accomplish certain goals prior to parenthood, i.e. before it's too late. Frankly, we're both a little bit freaked out. The truth is, the sweetest sound in the world to me is a baby crying when my wife's around; I know that's good for six months birth control minimum.But this film is very good, with a great deal of heart and insight. At times you get a glimpse of what parenting is like when things aren't the best, and yet, you also get a sense of what makes all the hard work worth it, and therefore the film does it's job.It's also still very funny and charming too, despite the scary parts.",Parenthood

These worked well and I felt they were more reflective of the 20th century American Family.The movie is an easy watch.

Trying to make a movie of an everyday life is never easy, and let's face it - Ron Howard does a terrible job here. The characters are as annoying as they get, and as unbelievable as they get. This makes for an indigestible concoction - supposedly real life with unreal characters. And to be honest, I can not recall a movie with more annoying characters than this one. Every appearance of either Dianne Wiest or Mary Steenburgen on screen made me shut my eyes and mute the TV. There are three reasons for this though. The first one is the terrible script. The second one is awful directing. And last, but not the least, is the ridiculously pathetic acting. I was never a fan of Steve Martin whose acting abilities to me are as shallow as a puddle, but the rest of the cast make him stand out simply by being even worse. The only exception is, of course, Jason Robards who is in a league of his own here. Actually, in some of his scenes I felt like I was watching a different movie all together, a smart, touching, sometimes funny movie. And then it was back to Steve Martin and his crowd... One last point to make. (Here be spoilers). Could there be a more stereotypical, clichéd and silly ending? The boy catches the ball, the father gets the promotion, the marriages are saved, everybody happily procreates, and the family of morons lives on. God bless America. Wow.

All give phenomenal performances that were tailor made for them. Who else but Steve Martin could be Cowboy Gil? And who but Dianne Wiest could portray a tough as nails, but sweetly feminine single mother? And who else but Keanu Reeves and Martha Plimpton could have been the Romeo and Juliet wannabes Todd and Julie? Some of the situations in the film could seem far-fetched, but the likability of the cast is so immense that you just have to take it as it comes.

Now as a parent I most certainly can relate to a bunch of the issues in this movie, and when I in 20 years become a grand parent, I will bet you, I can relate to this movie again.The performances in this movie are overall great.

Keanu Reeves performance as Tod left a bad taste in my mouth that I still haven't been able to get rid of. Although I've never been a fan of his in particular this would have left me avoiding his future films had I seen it prior to Speed. Jason Robards was a high note in an otherwise flat movie. This film was a strain from the start, though in exaggeration it is realistic, parents should be able to relate to the feelings of the characters, it's not ENTERTAINING.

I don't remember it being a favourite at the time, but watching it now, as a parent, puts an entirely different prespective on it. As well as being genuinely funny, it's really astute and genuinely touching. It's a great ensemble cast and feels like a personal labour of love for Ron Howard.While I feel for Steve Martin dealing with his ' special son', his usual acting limitations are evident, the real pick is Diane Weist, an outstanding performance as a single mum dealing with the problems of her two kids.

Parenthood is a masterpiece. And I don't use that phrase easily, I think only 10 of the approximately 900 movies I've seen deserve this qualification. I'm someone's daughter, I'm someone's wive, and I'm someone mother. In every three of these capacities, I recognized the feelings of some of the many, many characters in this movie. Ron Howard gave us a mirror in which anyone of us can see herself or himself. And it's not only yourself you see, you also recognize a lot of people who played (or still are playing) an important part in your life. The fact that you can really relate to the characters is one of the great assets of this movie. I want to give an enormous compliment to the guys who wrote the script. There are so many important characters in this movie, it's amazing how they managed to give everyone of them enough attention, without letting the story break into little pieces. Everything just fits in perfectly! I would like the Academy to introduce a new award-category, namely an Oscar for 'the entire cast'. If there had been such an Oscar in 1989, the actors and actresses of Parenthood surely would have won it.

When the above scene happens, the parents at first try to prevent their child from disturbing the play. They then become resigned to the fact that it will happen and accept it with smiles on their faces.This is really scratching the surface and not delving in to what is really going on. The director wants us to laugh at this situation but all I could do is be upset for the teacher, the students, the parents and anyone else involved in months of work coming to an epic failure.

80,rwd4evr,A movie for all stages of life,10,28 March 2004,"This is an excellent movie, very similar to Terms of Endearment.  It shows how even in a close-knit family, each member brings his or her unique personality and perspective.  Jason Robards is the self-made patriarch, with strong opinions about the definition of ""success.""  He clearly approves more of his son Larry (Tom Hulce), a ne'er-do-well con artist who cannot manage his money or his relationships.  Larry talks his father's party line and manages to fool him until the final minutes of the film.  This misplaced favoritism is especially hard on the oldest son, Gil (Steve Martin), who lives his life in a super-responsible manner, taking on guilt for his own failings and everyone else's.  Gil is especially worried about his oldest son who, at age 8, is already neurotic.  Helen (Dianne Wiest) is Gil's divorced sister, trying to raise a teenage daughter (Martha Plimpton) and an adolescent son (Joaquin Phoenix).  The daughter is heavily involved with a good-natured slacker (Keanu Reeves), and Helen is terrified that she is not doing enough to keep her daughter from making an irrevocable mistake with her life.  These stories, and the other subplots in the film, are serious in nature, but Ron Howard, Ganz and Mandel combine their talents to make a fabulously lighthearted product that is also satisfyingly profound. 
Toward the end of the film, Jason Robards concedes to Steve Martin that parenthood is a job that never ends, no matter how ""grown-up"" your kids become.  This movie can reaffirm anyone of any age who is a member of any family.  /r",Parenthood

I like heart-warming, but it needs to be consistent For example, the Steve Martin family was muddling through with a child who might have to be moved out of his mainstream school, a child who struggled with baseball But what happens? The boy becomes a baseball hero! And that makes everything all right!

There's no denying that this is a depiction of American life - highly competitive, driven and full of aspiration and disappointment, but because it taps into so many archetypes, it really doesn't matter, the import and complexity really comes across.
If you haven't seen it, it's an absolute gem. If you've o my seen it once, watch it again, there's so much in the spoken and unspoken script and the cast - Jason Robards, Dianne Weist, Mary Steenburgen, Martha Plympton, Steve Martin - a wonderful mix of whimsy, slapstick humour and drama, a real opportunity to act.

But the main thing that appeals to me about Parenthood is the warm heart that is at the center of it all. These characters have nuanced, complicated, and not overly dramatic problems. Just like REAL PEOPLE, and unlike many of the one-faceted characters seen in movies today.And what better actor to play Gil than Steve Martin? A comedic genius, Martin is capable of playing anything from slimy to sincere, conforming perfectly to his role, and it helps that he's not a cynic. Also watch for great appearances by Tom Hulce, perhaps best known as Amadeus (poor guy, where'd his career go?) and a very young Joaquin Phoenix as Gary.All in all, a very funny and very sweet comedy that I will give a 9/10!!",Parenthood

The movie is so true to life about the joys, the struggles, the emotions of being a parent, yet does it with some absolutely hilarious scenes.  There is a great cast and the story flows so well, there are lots of laughs with never a dull moment.  I see my siblings and my parents in these characters and the ""roller coaster"" analogy of life describes my wife's and my outlook too well!What tops off this great movie is the ending.  I am frequently disappointed at how many comedies are very funny early, but once the gags are used up, struggle to find an ending.  The end here is both surprising and extremely satisfying.   As my kids get older, problems of their adulthood loom on the horizon, I am reminded of Jason Robards' words near the end of the movie about parenting...""It never ends, it never ends!",Parenthood

89,smwise3,I loved this movie!,10,4 February 2007,"Ron Howard did an amazing job with Parenthood. It's a movie I would consider allowing my kids to watch were it not for the sexual innuendos and suggestive scenes, but as adult-type entertainment, it never fails to entertain. The screenplay is witty and there probably isn't a family in America that could not identify with at least some aspects of the film, marriage, child rearing, career issues, etc. Steve Martin in a way reprises his role in Father of the Bride, but here he reveals more depth and generates more sympathy for his predicament. Mary Steenburgen as his wife and Dianne Wiest as his sister were standouts, as were Jason Robards as his father. Helen Shaw as the grandmother was a delight, and Rick Moranis was very much in character from his ""Blew Up..."" series. Oddly enough, in a movie about parenthood, other than mostly all the kids having some sort of problems, I didn't find them particularly lovable. Though the end has been called syrupy or corny, I loved it.",Parenthood

91,kentig,My whole life is have-to,8,30 June 1999,"This is a fine movie that is full of humor, as well as some real touching moments.  It's about how a family interacts not only in society, but with each other.  Every person's strengths and faults are on display, and the portrayals by this ensemble cast are right on target.  Steve Martin, as Gill, is probably the central character here, & he has to deal not only with the hypocracy in the work force, but with his tempermental and sensitive son.                                                 I thought that the storyline was well developed, and that the characters seemed true to life. Ron Howard did an excellent job of directing. The ending is very bittersweet, as even with the multi births and the happiness shown on the faces of the family members, you can also notice them in pensive poses, as though wondering what life will have in store for each of them, as well as the new additions.  A good, thought-provoking movie indeed.",Parenthood

On reflection, it is mainly about fathers and their relationship with their spouses and children with all the problems and challenges fatherhood can bring, but told with such a deft empathic hand that I am stunnned that this film does not appear in your 100 Best Films.   It is Steve Martin at his very best - both funny and humanly vulnerable - and with a cast of near-perfect performances from his fellow co-stars.  The scene where Diane Wiest's young son contacts his estranged father to try to arrange for a visit never fails to make me weep, or the line Keanu Reeves delivers with such brilliant pathos ... something like ""you have to have a licence for almost anything but you don't have to have a licence to become a father"".

It ought to be a ""10.""One of the aspects about Parenthood that makes it so particularly unusual and agreeable to the viewer's palate is the blending of humor and drama. This also works to make it believable, even as some things are (of course) over the edge. After all, it stars Steve Martin. It's of the best movies of the 20th century. Brilliant, Ron Howard!

Ron Howard has the magic touch and orchestrates the fine acting, solid script, and remarkable attention to details in the smallest things. The pacing of the direction is very smooth and astute. Steve Martin turns in a solid dramatic performance, showing his talent as an actor is often underplayed. I've watched this one close to 60 times and somehow never get tired of it.

The screenplay is hilarious and there probably isn't a family in America that could not identify with many of the issues touched on in this film. I think we all forget that even parents are people too every now and then and I ask my folks how they did it. I'm always told there is no book to raising a child, you just have to do the best you can. but it was so realistically portrayed that anyone could get into this film. If you are a any member of a family, this is the movie to see. In the end, Parenthood is a great comedy-drama of what all parents go through in the funnest and scariest times of their kid's lives.

Moranis and Robards are perfectly cast and Keanu Reeves is equally well cast as, well, Keanu Reeves - a role at which he traditionally excels!Not too schmaltzy which is a common failing with American family dramas and the kids were not ""cute"" in that bratty, obnoxious or sickly saccharine way that American kids are so often portrayed.Loved it!",Parenthood
102,bellabutterflye,The ending was just too cheesy! C'mon!!,1,18 September 2005,"I would have rated this movie higher but the ending is what spoiled it for me. Everyone has a brand new baby to raise. Yippee!!! The answer to all their ""problems, prayers, etc..."" Otherwise, if only one set of parents had a baby and the rest did not, then the others couldn't lead fulfilled productive lives with all that they had right then? Right? Is that the message here? More means better? I found the ending incredibly cheesy after watching this otherwise poignant, often funny, and as true to life of a ""parenting"" movie I've seen. Great performances particularly by Jason Robards and Dianne Wiest.I wonder what would happen if the Buckmans had decided on an abortion. Gee, that would have really been hard to keep the lighter comedic element going. And for those parents who have ""only"" children, the message is, that's just not good enough folks. The only child character of the Huffner's was only ""strange"" because of the parenting she was getting from freaky Huffner, played by Moranis. So, if his wife was so worried about how he's raising their child, why is she insistent they have another one, and soon!!! Where is the logic there? I realize this movie was intended to be more of a ""feel good"" movie for parents, and families, young and old alike. It was just too formulaic and predictable and the ending was the real kicker. The movie was called ""Parenthood"" for a reason and gee, I guess the only ending could be one with a new crop of babies for everyone!!",Parenthood

I don't feel it's telling anyone to have kids to be happy.  It's so much more than that.  It's about just being part of a family and how family members can support and disappoint you. It's about how difficult being a parent can be and the rewards.  It's about responsibility.  My favorite movie line of all time is when Keanu Reeves character, Tod, says: (*spoiler*) ""You know, Mrs. Buchman, you need a license to buy a dog, to drive a car -- hell, you even need a license to catch a fish.

Robards has 4 children---played by Steve Martin, Tom Hulce, Harley Jane Kozak, and Diane Wiest. The previous reviewer incorrectly stated Rick Moranis as one of Jason Robard's sons. This is not correct. In the movie it is Harley Jane Kozak who is the daughter and rick moranis is the son-in-law. All have their own problems within their families and this what makes it shine. Life is full of surprises and we basically see how each of the families cope with issues, problems and disasters. This ranges from Tom Hulce needing to settle a huge gambling debt to Steve Martin finding out from his son's school that they want to kick him out and place him in a school for special needs children.I don't want to give away too much of the movie but I will end with this....The classic moment is when the great grandmother shows up (helen Shaw). Harley Jane Kozak takes her to her house while they catch Diane Weist watching a porno flick.

So I was happy when it finally wended its way to the top of my Netflix queue. I am a big fan of Steven Martin, and I was hoping that this would be a movie that would showcase his dramatic side in the way that certain movies showcased Bill Murray as a serious actor.I was, as the title of this review says, sadly disappointed. It's a rare movie, I suppose, that manages to balance comedy and drama, and this one failed in that regard. The dramatic element seemed trite and exaggerated: it was hard to take the serious side seriously because it was so overboard (the Rick Moranis family, e.g.). Then, played off against this, the parts that did force a laugh seemed somewhat juvenile.
