0,Leofwine_draca,Could have been better,5,29 June 2019,"I AM MOTHER is another post-apocalyptic sci-fi flick about characters trapped in a bunker due to contamination in the outside world. As such it comes across as very similar to other movies of recent years, not just made by Netflix, but films like 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE too. The story follows a young female protagonist around, focusing particularly on her relationship with her ""mother"", a robot designed to care for her every need.The story is quite slim although enlivened by a sub-plot involving an on-form Hilary Swank. It certainly looks good, with an interesting setting and the robot bought to life in a realistic way. However, at two hours this is overlong and it does feel like the writers struggled to come up with a meaningful ending, because what we have is something of a damp squib. There are effective moments scattered throughout, but by the end I was left wanting more.",I Am Mother
1,SnoopyStyle,ok sci-fi premise,6,8 June 2019,"Daughter (Clara Rugaard) has been grown from an embryo by a robot called Mother (Rose Byrne) in a high tech bunker full of other fetuses. Mother claims that a contagion had wiped out humanity and they're trying to bring back humanity. One day, a woman (Hilary Swank) breaks into the bunker.This has a fine sci-fi premise. The beginning is a little slow but it has loads of promise. The introduction of Swank bumps up the tension. When they break out of the compound, the movie is set to do some great discovery. The story runs into a world building problem. It doesn't explain the world and it doesn't really explain the robot's objective. It leaves too much unspoken. In the end, it has no more material than a Twilight Zone episode. It's interesting but not that compelling.",I Am Mother
2,claudio_carvalho,"Intriguing, Original but with a Messy and Disappointing Conclusion",5,30 June 2019,"After the extinction of the human race, an android called ""Mother"" is responsible to repopulate Earth using a collection of embryos stored in a base. Her teenage daughter (Clara Rugaard) is submitted to classes and tests to assess her development as human being. When the daughter finds a mouse inside the base, she suspects that the outside is no longer contaminated. One day, she sees a wounded woman (Hilary Swank) outside the base and let her in. Soon she will learn news that will affect her relationship with her Mother.""I am Mother"" is an intriguing and original sci-fi with a promising storyline. Unfortunately the conclusion is messy and disappointing. The incoherent behavior of the daughter trusting in a stranger is weird and inconsistent with her education. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): Not Available",I Am Mother
3,nogodnomasters,Have I ever been wrong?,6,19 June 2019,"After an unexplained human extinction, an automated re-population station goes into activation. One of the 63,000 embryos is brought to term as a robot raises a human (Clara Rugaard). She believes she is the only human until Hilary Swank shows up at the door.The story dragged on. The daughter was given a standard MMPI test and I am not sure how accurate such a test can be if you are the only human alive. Interesting twist. You knew one was coming.No swearing, sex, or nudity.",I Am Mother
4,kosmasp,Kids don't understand,8,8 January 2021,"Or do they? And am I talking about those viewing the movie or the one(s) who are in it? Well wouldn't you like to know? Maybe you do, but first things first. The movie was quite a surprise. I hadn't heard much of it and then you get a nice little gem served like this. With some really good actors in it. Not many due to the nature of the movie, but still.The Science Fiction aspect of it works nicely, the mystery and the story structure keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat too. The guessing game is big in this one and I would say it is a very good one. Structure of the movie, reveals and twists are laid out the right way. Visually stunning too, even if quite contained overall. What is the Endgame one may ask, what is this trying to tell us? Or is it just entertainment? Well you'll have to watch it to know",I Am Mother
5,ComedyFan2010,When droids raise you,7,9 June 2019,"This is a pretty nice sci fi movie. Movies about machines and humans live together and whether one cant trust each other are common. Ex Machina comes to mind. But usually it is humans ""raising"" the robots. In this case it is the other way around.It feels a bit slow but I guess this represents well what life feels like for the daughter. It also gives us a good feeling of the terrifying atmosphere when the daughter needs to decide between her droid mother and another human. Whom can she trust? The droid looks pretty scary but at the same has this soothing motherly voice which is a great combination for this kind of movie.Great acting and I like the idea behind Hilary Swank's character and who it is supposed to be. They never say it out loud but the ones who follow what is said will know.",I Am Mother
6,deloudelouvain,That's how you make an interesting sci-fi movie.,8,6 February 2020,"Good little sci-fi movie that kept my attention during the entire movie. I Am Mother is the perfect example that you can make an entertaining sci-fi without having a huge budget. The cast is very small, basically it's just two actresses (Clara Rugaard and Hilary Swank) and another (Rose Byrne) for the voice of Mother, but it's all it needed to make it interesting. They all did a good job playing their respective characters. It's the kind of stories I enjoy, post apocalyptic ambiance, robots and/or artificial intelligence taking over. It's all well done, intriguing enough to stand out from the rest, much better than some high budget science fiction movies. I can't see much people disliking this movie, not if you are into this genre.",I Am Mother
7,siderite,Intelligent design,8,15 June 2019,"I blame AI, the Spielberg film, for starting the craze for philosophical movies about artificial intelligence, but Moon and, of course, Ex Machina, for redefining the genre as performance pieces with a few actors and one grand idea. And some movies get it right, some not so much, but they never get it wrong, because you either like it or you risk seeming stupid for ""not getting it"". I Am Mother has some interesting ideas, good acting, therefore is a solid entry in the category, but really it's two hours of waiting for something to happen only to be shown the obvious. I have to admit it was fun coming up with more and more outlandish theories of what was about to happen, but then it felt disappointing to see that the first ""normal"" theories were right and there was nothing more ingenious than that.A good movie, worth watching, but bringing little new to the table. But I have to say I liked that Rose Byrne was billed second as Mother's voice, with Luke Hawker first, as the Mother's body. This is something new and right.",I Am Mother
8,thesar-2,Mother A.I.?,5,19 April 2020,"I would watch this first in a double feature with Ex Machina because...you gotta save the best for last.Heck, while you're at it, make it a triple feature with this still first and now adding: Passengers in the middle. All three movies are incredibly similar in tone, setting, subgenre and structure. I would say to add The Terminator, but the only one that truly fits was Terminator: Salvation and I would never recommend that movie.(You could also include in The Matrix Series, 10 Cloverfield Lane and Alien: Covenant and make it a very long evening.)So, if you're fond of Ex Machina, Passengers and the rest sans T4/Alien:C, get your butt down to watch it all over again, but expect less. Not to say this was bad, but by the 2-hour end time, you will wonder why said butt is asleep.Mother! (Oops, sorry, this movie reference actually DOESN'T fit...trying again...) A robot ""Mother"" creates a new baby in a computerized bunker post apocalypse. Apparently, we need to start over since we did it again: blew up civilization as we always do in these movies. That baby grows into a teen and has a nice bond with her machine-mommy when a mysterious, wounded and distrusting 3rd female knocks at the bunker door. And now, the lying game's afoot. Who can you trust?I didn't hate this. I didn't necessarily really like it. It was fine. The sets and technology were excellent, acting fine and suspense there. It's just...okay. But, be aware, one of the opening texts makes it kinda easy to figure out where this is headed. Or came from, more accurately.Barely a recommendation. But, again, if those movies I mentioned above are your bag, by all means. Just be prepared.***Final thoughts: I spent the entire screen time of the 3rd female character played by Hilary Swank thinking she was Jennifer Garner. Heck, in my defense, they could be twins. Not sure how any of this relevant, but I guess I'm pointing out: we all make mistakes.",I Am Mother
9,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,High aiming sci-fi that just fails to engage,4,19 June 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn a bleak futuristic landscape, where humanity has been wiped out, a robotic machine named Mother (played by Luke Hawther and voiced by Rose Byrne) artificially inseminates a human daughter (Clara Rugaard) and when she comes of age, tries to instil in her the virtues and wisdom she thinks she will need to survive. However, Daughter becomes curious about there being more to the world than she's been shown, and when she wonders out her boundaries, discovers a woman (Hilary Swank) who unlocks a whole new world, much to the disdain of Mother.In a world that grows more precarious by the day, science fiction is a genre that has all the potential to enjoy a new resurgence, where the type of intelligent ideas explored by the likes of Phillip K. Dick can make a comeback, and which Netflix has delved into already with films such as Tau. I Am Mother, from first time director Grant Sputore, certainly has the setup to be one such film, exploring a world in which resources have dried up and AI technology has consumed and taken over the human race, which some may say are very real concerns facing the world at present.It's another film featuring a bunch of characters you can count on one hand, with all the drama contained in a singular, isolated setting, giving you more chance to connect with these limited characters more individually and effectively. This, though, is something it fails to do, all too over bearing and clunky, distinctly humourless and unaffecting. While you can't help but admire the scope, and the thought provoking ideas it's trying to explore, not of it ever really draws you in.A film that shoots itself in the foot by taking itself so seriously, especially considering how outlandish many will find it. **",I Am Mother
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Three women and a baby.,8,3 May 2020,"'I Am Mother (2019)', essentially, a three-woman show, its cast mostly confined to a single location. Nevertheless, the relatively low-budget piece is ambitious. Much of that ambition comes down to its eponymous Mother, an artificial intelligence with one of the most impressively realised mechanical bodies ever seen on screen. For the most part, the robotics are delightfully practical and, as such, highly believable. It's easy to forget that you aren't actually looking at another cast member. Perhaps this is the case because the movie never makes a point of revelling in its visual effects, instead electing to use them to tell its story. The narrative deals with often-seen themes but it does so with aplomb. As it unfolds, it does an excellent job of keeping you on your toes; you're never sure who to trust. What you are sure of, though, is just how intriguing it all is. You're put in the shoes of its young protagonist and are allowed to experience everything the way she does, which makes for a very active viewing experience. Despite several twists and turns, the thing never once cheats. It all just slides into place perfectly, compounded by some relatively bold foreshadowing that rewards perceptive viewers. As it reaches its end, the film becomes incredibly suspenseful. It's also somewhat affecting, as its interesting premise is taken to an even more interesting place and it ends on a brilliantly bittersweet note. It's a fantastic debut and is certainly one of Netflix's best offerings. It's also, and I mean this in the best of ways, fantastically feminist. 8/10",I Am Mother
11,bowmanblue,You know something is amiss,6,15 June 2019,"Netflix's latest original movie tells the story of the human race and it's (near) total decline. Now, a lone robot ('Mother') plucks one (lucky?) embryo from among many in a secret underground laboratory which seems to have survived the apocalypse and raises that child as her 'daughter.'Throughout the first part of the story we see the robot lovingly tend to the little girl's every desire, whether emotional, physical and even playful (from the confines of the lab complex). Mother often informs her how humanity destroyed itself and she is trying to raise the little girl as the first of many 'children' who will one day take back their planet. It's all very sweet. Only it isn't. If it was a Pixar animated movie then it would be sweet, because it would clearly be aimed at children. However, below this nurturing tale, appears to lie something deeper - and possibly darker?As you watch, you just get the feeling that something is very wrong (besides the obvious fact that humanity has destroyed itself!) and there are many clues as to what's really going on, plus a decent amount of 'red herrings' which may throw you off the scent. It ends up one big exercise in trying to second guess the ending and what's really going on.As the film goes on, more and more of 'Mother's' mantra starts to fall apart under questioning and the addition of a 'survivor' from outside entering the facility throws both Mother and 'Daughter's' world into turmoil.This is one of those films that doesn't look cheap enough for you to dismiss it as 'something that should be on the 'Sci-fi Channel,' as it has a decent budget (plus it was able to afford both Rose Byrne's voice for 'Mother' and Hilary Swank as the survivor). The sets look good and the computer effects depicting the outside world look realistic enough to be believable. However, overall I would say that this probably isn't the kind of movie that would exactly 'set the Box Office alight.' It's probably best on Netflix and with an audience who can find it and enjoy it at their leisure. If you like slow-moving, quite thoughtful sci-fi then this is worth adding to your watchlist.",I Am Mother
12,Cineanalyst,Derivative Droids,6,12 June 2019,"Although I was fairly engrossed in the moment of viewing it, I'm afraid ""I Am Mother"" will prove forgettable, which is unfortunate because it seems intended as a thoughtful bit of sci-fi, as opposed to the more action-heavy variety (although there's some of that here, too, including people fighting against and running away from robots). It appears that a hint of ambiguity and a bit of puzzle may amuse some, as will the droid's philosophizing about killing humans for the benefit of humans, but all of it barely rises above, say, the intrigue of the rise of the machines in ""The Terminator"" series. Indeed, the droids here are quite a bit like Skynet had that artificial intelligence got very interested in social engineering and reading Kant instead of nuclear weapons and time travel.But droids have been wreaking havoc on screens since at least 1927's ""Metropolis."" The most blatant reference in this one, however, has to be to the ""listening eye"" of Hal 9000 spying on those who conspire to destroy it. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) this is not, though, which would be fine enough if it did anything particularly clever or novel. In particular, a bit of self-reflexive artistry would've been appreciated, especially considering the ""2001"" allusion, the inclusion of the viewing of a TV-show-within-the-movie, and dance being part of the daughter's curriculum. The dance business may bother me most of all here, because it serves no evident purpose. (To be fair and by contrast, the origami business is integrated rather well.) Compare this to the also-at-first-seemingly innocuous dance references in ""Us"" (2019), where dance self-reflexively becomes a metaphor for unique human qualities. Not so in ""I Am Mother,"" which robotically includes dance for presumably the same reason that the robot in the movie included it in the daughter's education as the product of some code stating that it's supposedly patently part of a well-rounded education.",I Am Mother
13,851222,A not bad sci-fi flick,7,21 June 2019,"Greetings from Lithuania.""I Am Mother"" (2019) was a pretty solid sci-fi flick with some good performances and even better concept. Although ending was interesting, it kinda felt a bit disappointing as it didn't really showed us the outcome.Overall, ""I Am Mother"" has a good ideas and at running time 1 h 50 min i wasn't bored, but given a pretty great concept maybe i was excepting something better.

15,briancham1994,Great sci-fi film,8,2 June 2020,This was an excellently made sci-fi film with an interesting setting. The interactions between the girl and the robot mother were convincing. The progression had a lot of tension and surprises.,I Am Mother
16,eddie_baggins,"Smart and savvy, I Am Mother is top notch Sci-fi",7,13 June 2019,"A huge hit on the black list script scene in 2016, first time feature filmmaker and Australian Grant Sputore has found himself with not only a name brand cast in the form of multiple Oscar winner Hilary Swank and the voice work of beloved Aussie actress Rose Byrne, but a giant opportunity to be seen across the globe thanks to a distribution deal with Netflix for his thinking person's sci-fi I Am Mother.Very much in the same vein as classic sci-fi entries such as Ex_Machina, Moon and Annhilation, Mother is one of the more impressive and polished feature debuts of recent memory, and certainly one of the most high quality Australian backed productions in some time, as Sputore explores motherly bonds, sacrifice for the greater good and of course the old time sci-fi exploration of A.I and what separates man from machine.We've seen other films of this ilk before, but Sputore and writing partner Michael Lloyd Green add enough new flavour and ideas to make Mother feel like a relatively fresh sci-fi experience, that feels plausible and relatable, a sci-fi not of the far distant future but one more of the sci-now variety that feels like it could be waiting around humanity's next corner of exploration.The core story of the Rose Byrne voiced CGI creation of Mother, a robot charged with ensuring humanities survival in the face of a world shattering event as she raises Clara Rugaard's teenager in an underground facility filled with human embryos, is one that allows Sputore to add heart, thrills and chills to his tale and one that is expertly played out by its main cast.This is one of those star making vehicles, with Rugaard knocking her turn out of the park as the nameless daughter of Mother, very much similar to Alicia Vikander's memorable turn in Ex_Machina, you can tell big things await Rugaard from here on out.She's ably supported by the ever reliable Swank as underground bunker outsider and potential threat Woman, whose appearance around the half way mark of the film marks a tonal change of pace for the otherwise more glacial film, that takes its time to build up Mother's arc as a determined and focused artificially intelligent matriarch.Unfortunately for Sputore and the film as a whole, Mother does begin to lose steam in its latter half.After a gripping and expertly played out opening act, dwindling returns begin to make their way into the film as the run-time wears on and it feels as though as a whole, the film peters out to a more generic and emotionally unsatisfying climax, although the disappointing endgame components of the film aren't enough to ruin what is an otherwise far above average sci-fi and locally made product.Final Say -I Am Mother is a must-watch for sci-fi aficionados and an extremely promising and polished debut feature from Australian filmmaker Sputore. With a career making turn for Clara Rugaard at its core, the disappointing elements of Mother's narrative arc are not enough to stop the film from becoming one of the year's best streaming offerings.3 ½ furnaces out of 5",I Am Mother
17,Tweetienator,Missed Its Full Potential,7,8 June 2019,"The idea is interesting, the production great, the acting is also good, but the story does (imo) not live up to its full potential. Also there are some flaws here and there, e.g. the girl heard the voice of the woman (Swank) and the bumping thru 2 securing air-locking steel gates and also listened to the conversation of Mother and the Woman thru a medical door (which I bet was also an air-locking one)...Anyway, I Am Mother provides solid entertaining - if you like the theme post-apocalyptic sci-fi (even if the twists and the ending are rather Hollywood kitsch). All in all no masterpiece but for sure also not a rate of 1 etc.Last note: mothers (and fathers) have a hard time in our days - either they are portrayed overprotective or they do not care enough, anyway, they always do wrong (if they are not simply completely evil to the bone). My advice: don't make babies, your role in history is fixed from the beginning to the end, you be warned ;)",I Am Mother
18,southdavid,The Cake Is A Lie,5,3 September 2019,"Another day, another Science Fiction film on Netflix, which has a decent premise but ultimate meanders along to provide not that much.Set post a largely undefined apocalyptic event, the film is set in a repopulation centre where one robot ""Mother"" (voiced by Rose Byrne) is raising one of the 60,000 embryos as her daughter. Eventually played by Clara Rugaard-Larsen, ""Daughter"" is a bright and moral child, but is frustrated by the constricting nature of their home. Their relationship is shaken when an injured woman (Hilary Swank) is let into the facility by Daughter, who tells a different story about life outside the centre.Though lacking the same sense of humour, ""I am Mother"" might be the closest that we get to a ""Portal"" film. The ""Mother"" character bears a strong likeness to ""Glados"" from that series, and her testing nature, as well as the references to ""Cake"", are also lifted from the game. With that template to worth with, the film looks amazing. The CGI as well as the practical effects are great.Storyline wise though, the film isn't quite as sharp. It starts well, but then settles into a few mild horror movie-esque tropes as we try to decide whether ""Mother"" or the woman is telling the truth, before meandering to a conclusion that most people would be able to guess and leaves an inquisitive mind with more questions than answers.",I Am Mother

It appears that one fine day the robot just decides to grow a human. The robot raises and highly educates this girl to a teenager and has kept her from the outside world due to a perceived danger from violence and disease. As this girl matures, will she desire to understand what is beyond the compound walls? This felt like a blend of 10 Cloverfield Lane and Ex-Machina in reverse. With pleasing and effective cinematography it established an atmosphere of solitude complimented with a nice score and a deep and thought provoking story that has been done before many times. Questions asked: is a super precise robot who did everything by 'the book' a better mother than a naturally flawed human?

A girl is raised from embryo to I guess late teens by a robot in a station on a remote planet where some sort of devastation has occurred. She's in good health, scores well in her grades & seems to be shaping up to be a model citizen but when a hurt woman, played by Oscar winner Hilary Swank, stumbles into their Eden from the world beyond, our heroine's (only identified as daughter by her metal matriarch) worldview is shattered as she learns what the outside world really is (she's been told the outside is toxic & dangerous to her) & how she will go forward w/this information. Working w/concepts from diverse films ranging from Saturn 3 or Demon Seed, this ambiguous sci-fi'er asks more questions than it eventually answers which is fine I guess in a world where TV shows like Lost & HBO's Westworld continue to provide head scratching tales to keep our feeble brains working overtime.

A central droid controlling all the others and finding a human mother is ""Mother"".Mother raises ""3"" as the movie begins. Of course this implies there has been 2 previous attempts. ""3, or Daughter"" is progressing as hoped for by ""Mother"". Still Daughter has human curiosity and to test if she has all the other ""right stuff"" that tempurs curiosity ""Mother"" has an ultimate test up it's CPU. This is where the movie really shows it's originality and fresh creativity. It's like orchestrated choas provoking ""Daughter"" to act. Will she pass this final test which will draw all of her raising, learning, and morality? One isn't sure and the events that seem random are anything but. Very intriguing and slowly paced revealing more of ""Mother's"" mission.I Am Mother has a real indie feel. It may even be limited in budget as such, but the acting, the sets, the effects, and the writing are of a high caliber indeed.

29,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,A sci-fi thriller that leads its audience to believe things more than they should,8,22 June 2019,"Science fiction futures are becoming more of a reality every day. Technology is becoming smarter, quicker, more dynamic and more independent. While most of these attributes are good things, for every plus comes a negative, or vise versa. For all the science fiction films that brought audiences cute and happy Johnny Fives from Short Circuit (1986), there will always be a T-800 from James Cameron's The Terminator (1984). It's something that us humans need to be mindful of every time we tinker with these artificial intelligent contraptions. If we're not careful, as many public figures have expressed, we humans may be responsible for our own undoing. Which is pretty much how this film starts off.In a not so distant future, viewers are introduced to a sentient robot who calls herself mother, voiced by Rose Byrne. There she artificially conceives a baby using enhanced biotechnology. Time passes and we learn that things have become rather rotten outside and Mother doesn't want her daughter (Clara Rugaard) to go outside. But like any young adult, her curiosity gets the better of her. More specifically, when an outsider gets her attention played by Hilary Swank. This new introduction in the daughter's life begins a battle between who is telling the truth. Both the female stranger and her mother begin saying things that seem questionable. The question is, who is more right, or, right at all for that matter?The script was written by Michael Lloyd Green who had only written for two short films before this. The same could be said for director Grant Sputore, who had only worked on one short and the Castaway series. However, things seemed to turn out okay because of the limited cast for this production. Most newcomer directors and writers have a harder time when big name stars, studios or productions are involved. That's not the case here though. Both Green and Sputore use their limits to the max by providing a tightly knit story with several layers of thought provoking commentary on human morals and where the decisions are no longer a yes or a no. Situations are not always two choices.Yet, the one thing the screenplay does not do justice for the film are the results of those decisions. There are a few vague setups that are open for interpretations that aren't exactly clear. This can be frustrating for viewers who will want some kind of resolve for various things. Really though, this is the only weak point within the movie. The actors cast for this feature do a competent job. Luke Hawker who plays the physical movements of Mother does a good job. Even without a face, expression can be understood through body language. The same could be said for Rose Byrne who voices Mother. Her vocals are not only soothing, but quite impressive for a robot who has one eye like that of Hal 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).Clara Rugaard and Hilary Swank also work well on screen together. Swank is obviously a veteran in her career but Rugaard plays a second best to her. Rugaard has also been in Teen Spirit (2018). As for the visuals, the special effects were very believable. Mother is quite a piece of machinery, kudos to the person who designed her. The cinematography by Steve Annis was good too, considering he's only shot for Kissing Candace (2017). The film score was also very appropriate, mixing synthesizers and classic orchestral components, making the story that more engaging. Composing the score was duo Dan Luscombe and Antony Partos; both have had their fair share of projects.Vague setups left for interpretation is probably the only shaky area to this feature. The cast, music, camerawork, effects and underlining themes are the soundest parts a viewer will come across in this intriguing sci-fi thriller.",I Am Mother
30,Kingslaay,Creative and Original,8,15 June 2019,"Do people write off Netflix originals just for the sake of it?This was a great, unique and engaging film. Full of intrigue and mystery. You wanted to know what was out there. The reality revealed in the end was interesting and dark. We thought about the whole nature of AI and what it was capable of. To think it was planned and for a purpose, for her to pass the ultimate test. Emphasis on the word ethics as that was important to show to the robot.Great original and glad I gave it a go.

Well cast, well directed with decent special effects (until the characters go outside near the end. That was obviously green screened). The Droid reminded me of the Chappie police bots. I've seen many variations of this story before and this used a lot of science fiction plots without being insulting to the viewer. I would have like to know what caused the extinction of Humanity. I don't think it was a droid revolution, unless it was one caused by humans - perhaps programming like the siliciates revolution in Space: Above and Beyond. Otherwise why would Droids want to bring back humanity? (There was a similar episode in Showtimes The Outer Limits - which was, as a series, far inferior to the original.)

32,nancyldraper,A slow burn thriller,9,20 June 2019,"I really liked this movie. You have to be OK with the SciFi aspects (robots, Dystopian future), but, if you are, this is a tremendous, slow burn thriller. People say it was predictable, I don't agree. That was the tension: Who to trust. Are there right choices? If you let it, it puts you squarely in the mind of Daughter, and that is where it excels. This is not about were it ends, its not about tying up all the loose ends, its about the journey. Great acting (Hilary Swank, as expected). But Clara Rugaard was a new talent to me and definitely someone for whom I shall be watching. Rose Byrne was the ideal voice actor for Mother. Ordinarily, I reserve ratings over 8 for films I'll want to see numerous time, but this film is a one-timer, its dynamic is in the not knowing, and I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10. {SciFi THRILLER}",I Am Mother

If you like sci-fi check it out because it will probably be right up your alley. It's not awful in fact, the concept is intriguing. The delivery was decent too.

34,omendata,Superb scifi....at last,7,10 June 2019,"So many bad multi million pound sci-fi movies this year, this is the first one to excel beyond its low budget to give us a seemingly high budget effort.The robot for a start is the first one since Maximillian in the Black Hole or Robby in Forbidden Planet that feels more than just an electronic robot and does make you warm to it thus lulling you into a false sense of security - well done to the special effects guys on this, really quite superb even the running motion of the robot was stunningly executed and realistic.The acting is superlative with the notable introduction of Clara Rugaard who is just amazing in her first big role and as usual Hilary Swank is as always perfect in any role she is given. Even the voice of the robot Clare Byrne is perfect.The cgi for a low budget is also extremely well done and the end reminds me a bit of the original Planet Of The Apes and the fields of corn like Terminator so it creates a really believable scenario and does it with gusto.So what let it down?
The end with the baby brother - once again we have to have the politically correct narrative with the baby being of coloured persuasion to appease the blm brigade. If this was a robotic society then colour has been a problem in the human race for millenia so why would these highly logical robots not create a race of one colour it seems illogical to me and if it were a pure white master-race it would have added that sinister element more to the end of the film but the producers had to cop out and give us a politically correct narrative - very sad and not in keeping with how an artificial intelligence would view a perfect society as the robot itself even said the old human race one of whose main problems is race and religion, so it was mothers job to remove all possible conflict and bring the child up with good moral values and logical non destructive emotions! I half expected the robot to put on a bhurka at the end to appease the religious brigade!All in all though it is a superb film with a good script and stunning visuals and almost perfect in every way for us Scifi lovers that never overreaches itself - watch it you will not be disappointed if you are a true Sci-fi fan!",I Am Mother

Instead it stimulated my viewing pleasure by making that lazy soggy brain work overtime, forcing me to put together the puzzle of the story. And it was a fine story about the end of humanity and re-evolution of the human race. The basic premise is about an intelligent and curious teenager, (called daughter), who is the only living being sheltered in a spacecraft like bunker underground.

This film really opened an interesting can of worms and then just went the standard hollywood action route.
Great sets, great scenery decent acting for what they were given to do, but then they felt they had to pull out the guns and get some stupid anger moves in here.
I really wanted to explore the back story, and understand what mother was looking for. it bought up the nurture verses nature argument then failed to do anything with it. An attentive 'mother' raising a child by the text book and they couldn't break free of the American rebel child cliche?
Fields of corn for who?
Civilization killed itself? tell us more about that.
There were a couple of subtle points started but left open, where as other lesser points were sledge-hammered.
And watching late night tv talk shows as suitable nurturing entertainment from mother. really? cheesy hipster touch more like it.

It's just that I wish I'd be spared them from time to time. Alas, that wasn't the case with ""I Am Mother"", a brooding, kinda slow sci-fi melodrama that goes...nowhere. I suppose if you're a fan of, say, ""Event Horizon"", you'll probably appreciate this flick ,ore than I did, but I like a beginning, middle and end to the 2 hours I dedicate to a film, not to be handed some incomplete story where you are forced to guess the ending. Big let down.",I Am Mother
42,kjproulx,A Fantastic Little Sci-Fi Film,9,9 June 2019,"I have been one of the biggest advocators for Netflix in terms of feature films, because they really are the way of the future. If for some reason they come to an end, they will still be remembered as the company that revolutionized the streaming platform. For obvious reasons like Roma, they have solidified their existence in being legitiment contenders for awards. With one of their latest releases in I Am Mother, I found myself completed invested from start to finish. This is easily one of Netflix's best feature films to date.Following a young woman known as Daughter as she has spent her entire life from birth to adulthood living on a spacecraft, raised by a robot who simply goes by the name Mother, I Am Mother is a story that immediately grabs your attention. Taking place throughout only a few set pieces, this is a very self-contained film with a lot of practical effects, making for a very realistic vision of a film. The core premise of the movie is that Daughter is confronted by another human, which sets the course of the film in motion. I really can't say much else without ruining where the story goes.Although the sci-fi genre has brought me a few of my favourites films, it's never been by favourite genre out there. For that reason alone, I always appreciate when a story in this genre can captivate me in its intricate details. Aside from a solid score and some odd choices of songs to use that really worked, this is a visually impressive film. Although there are moments of computer generated imagery (which is also fantastic when it does occur), I Am Mother is about 90% practical and you can really tell. I even impressed to see that the robot known as Mother wasn't computer generated.In the end, I Am Mother is a fantastic, intimate journey to take with these very few characters, which eventually leads an outcome that you'll either feel satisfied with, or feel short-changed. I loved acts one, two, and even three, but the final few minutes of this movie did leave a little to be desired. For that reason alone, I can't get myself to give this movie a perfect score, because upon reflection, I think I did want a little more from the conclusion. Regardless, this is one of my favourite films of 2019 so far, and it just so happens to be released by Netflix. I Am Mother is now streaming, and if you're even the smallest fan of the sci-fi genre, I recommend checking this one out.",I Am Mother

48,MrDHWong,An interesting film that successfully keeps the audience guessing until the very end,8,11 July 2019,"I Am Mother is a sci-fi drama film directed by Grant Sputore. Starring Hilary Swank, Clara Rugaard, and featuring the voice of Rose Byrne, it is an interesting film that successfully keeps the audience guessing until the very end.After a mass extinction wipes out all of humanity, a robot known as ""Mother"" (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a baby girl from an embryo in a hidden high-tech bunker for the purposes of repopulating the Earth. Many years later, the baby girl, referred to as ""Daughter"" (Clara Rugaard), is now a teenager and has since formed a bond with Mother. One day, a mysterious human woman (Hilary Swank) arrives at the bunker bearing frightening news of the outside world, threatening the close relationship between Mother and Daughter.While it does tread familiar territory at times, I Am Mother manages to rise above this with an intriguing premise and believable performances to help things along nicely. The film constantly presents its audience with a moral dilemma - Should we trust technology that is programmed to never make a mistake? Or should we always embrace human reasoning regardless of any flaws? Thanks to this ultimatum, the film is never boring and it adds a great deal of suspense to the plot. Newcomer Grant Sputore has proven himself a capable director, moving the story along at just the right pace and creating this enigmatic atmosphere of a post-apocalyptic world. I look forward to any future projects he may be involved in. Rose Byrne is great as the voice of Mother, a surrogate parental figure with seemingly suspicious motives, somewhat echoing 2001: A Space Odyssey's HAL 9000, but it is Danish actress Clara Rugaard who shines the most as Daughter, naive of the outside world but intelligent enough to understand basic human morality. Hilary Swank is also worth noting as the unnamed woman. It's a shame we don't see much of her on screen anymore, despite her two-time Oscar winning talent. This film will likely be overlooked in favour of more action focused blockbusters but it is certainly worth viewing on its current home at Netflix.I rate it 8/10",I Am Mother

56,PyroSikTh,Netflix Finally Finding their Formula,7,8 June 2019,"The world has ended, wiped out by something that we're told is toxic, and assumed may have been something nuclear, or at least included a lot of warfare. A robotic AI called Mother awakens, ready to kickstart the human race once more, and to do so starts with a trial run; Daughter. They remain secluded in their survival approximately fifteen years after Daughter's birth until Daughter's curiosity gets the better of her, and in trying to venture outside, instead finds a Woman waiting at the door with a gunshot wound. When letting the Woman in, she tells of a robotic uprising, which immediately makes her suspicious of Mother, and leading Daughter down into confusion and revelation as she seeks to uncover what the truth is, and which of her influencers are telling the truth.There honestly aren't really any glaring weaknesses in I Am Mother. Its story is interesting and entertaining, full of twists and turns, and packed with intrigue and mystery as you're led on this path alongside Daughter. It's told competently with decent pacing, and very little useless baggage. It evens ends somewhat ambiguously, which is about as close as it gets to a weakness. I didn't feel this was the kind of movie that needed or wanted an ambiguous ending. As such there's a big factor of the movie that could've been a massive revelation, but is instead left up to the viewer. I pegged it reasonably early on, and was disappointed not to have confirmation either way. There's heaps of hints towards it, but without any concrete answers I'm left keeping it largely to my own personal headcanon, which was unnecessary. It wasn't that kind of movie. It gave every other answer there was, so why not address the one it's been alluding to for half the movie? This is a bit nitpicky though, of course, and mileage may vary.But the movie doesn't particularly glow either. Every aspect is well-made and does its job, but there's nothing here that'll wow you. The visuals are really good, but aren't anything we haven't seen before, and even the creation of Mother feels like ground that's already been trodden before. She's just a humanoid android, played by a guy in a suit, that moves like a more sophisticated version of the humanoid robots we have today. The acting is good, but not particularly impressive either. Rose Byrne brings a sensitivity to Mother that always feels oddly cold and distant, so good work there. Hilary Swank is the scared and slightly hysterical woman, and remains convincing even when she lies, so good work there too. Clara Rugaard could really make something of herself for sure, or she could drift into obscurity like many actors and actresses her age sometimes do. She manages to keep up with Byrne and Swank well enough, but this isn't Dakota Fanning, Haley Joel Osment, or Hailee Steinfeld degrees of young acting.Honestly there isn't really that much for me to say about this movie. There was nothing terribly bad about it, but nothing particularly amazing either. It was a good film, especially if all you're looking for is two hours of entertainment, which is ultimately why anyone watches a movie.

61,MovieCriticOnline,Pleasantly surprised..,6,21 January 2020,"I am a harsh critic of films, especially since I believe films are getting worse and worse so it's nice to once in a while be surprised by something that is well acted, written and executed.The vast majority of indie films, especially sci-fi, are for the most part poorly written and worse, poorly executed. This, however, was the exception. The special effects were top notch and the performances were good and the plot kept you guessing. Despite this, and I would recommend this, I was a bit let down by the ending as it's been done many times before, even though not 100% the same. Notably Blade Runner, Moon and other films where the twist of underlying premise is similar.I know it's hard to come up with something totally new as so many ideas have been done already so I can overlook it, because this film was so well executed it doesn't really matter that it felt somewhat derivative of previous films with similar plots.My only other criticism would be that it was a bit slow at times and I wish they would have spent more time with her at her earlier age AND created more of a bond between Mother and Daughter, which would have up'ed the ante for the finale. I.e. it would have made her decisions at the end more difficult. Maybe even have justified Mother's intention and reasons for what it did what it did. A good film that did it was Watchmen where they created a very difficult moral dilemma of saving 5 billion by killing one million. It could have been stronger here, which again would have made the stakes higher.I gave it 6 because I reserve 10 stars for films that aren't e master pieces AND stand the test of time over a few decades. Most films these days are not even worth 1-2 stars. Maybe on more viewings my mind will be changed in either direction, but time will tell. Kudos to the film maker though.",I Am Mother
62,akcenat,A slow but an impressive Australian science fiction thriller,8,23 September 2019,"""I Am Mother"" is intelligent and suspenseful movie. It has a strong cast too, good production design, compelling robot design by Weta, fantastic musical score and a story that grabs you and does not let you go until the very last second. It's not perfect movie, because there are things that don't work, especially some lulls in the middle that mess with the momentum. The ending of the film is a bit lackluster and it is just a good fifteen minutes too long. But, If you're a fan of sci-fi films, ""I Am Mother"" is well worth a watch and certainly one of the better original offerings Netflix have in their growing catalog.

'I Am Mother' is a neatly crafted science fiction yarn that reminded me of
'10 Cloverfield Lane' and 'Saturn 3', with essence of 'The Terminator' thrown in for good measure.
This film tells the story of a teenage girl
(Clara Rugaard) raised in isolation in a underground bunker by a robotic mother.
The robot is designed to repopulate the Earth following an extinction event.
Mother and daughter's bond is tested when a stranger played by Hilary Swank arrives questioning all that the robotic parent has taught her child about the world outside.This film is gripping from the opening scene due to some splendid set design and special effects.
Rose Byrne lends her delicate and soothing voice to that of Mother.
The actual physical performance of the machine is portrayed by Luke Hawker.
Byrne does a fantastic job as she sounds trustworthy and loving as a mother should.
Hawker conveys both a soft motherly side and then menacing robotic threat as the film progresses.
Despite Swank being the Oscar winner amongst the cast it is young Clara Rugaard that carries this film.
She is very good here and her performance is aided by some impressive direction by Grant Sputore.
As I mentioned earlier this film was a real surprise.
Sputore has given us a delicious looking movie.
I was disappointed that this film wasn't presented in 4K HDR. Despite this image quality is very good.
Colours pop. The blue LED lights of control panels burst from the screen and hue saturation is rather heavy.
Sometimes skin tones could become a little muddled and contrast levels were often blinding but Blacks never become crushed.
Definition is crisp although as a 1080p presentation there is some notable film grain mainly in poorly lit scenes.
It was also evident that when the human characters ventured outside colours did become less vibrant.
The green colour of the vegetation in the fields wasn't as dynamic.
Sputore probably did this intentionally to give the outside world a bleak appearance.
Another disappointment was the lack of a Dolby Atmos sound mix.
Netflix offers many of its Originals with this superior sound format.
A good Science fiction like this would have benefited from a bolder sound mix.
However 'I Am Mother' still sounded great.
The Dolby Digital Plus mix had real impact.
The sound of Mother's clunking footsteps had weight and the climatic scene offered much for the Subwoofer to do.
Surround effects were nice and atmospheric, something that an Atmos track could have elevated further.
Dialogue was alway crisp and audible and front stereo effects gave the soundstage a wide presence.I am not familiar with the budget of this film but this looked like an expensive production.
Either that or Director Grant Sputore is a genius and spent the pennies very wisely. Every shot looks big budget Hollywood blockbuster and with that said Sputore is a filmmaker
we all should watch out for in the future.
This is one of the year's best Netflix movie offerings.",I Am Mother

And I was proved right.I think this was massively overlong and yet also massively underwritten. Much more time should have been spent before the introduction of Hilary Swank's character, establishing how normal and loving the relationship was between Mother and Daughter. Then, when Hilary Swank's character did appear, events could have moved quite quickly to a more compressed and satisfying conclusion.",I Am Mother

This was an Interesting sci-fi film, that keeps you engaged but actresses were nonsensical. Academy award winning Swank didn't think this one thru and the young actresses character was just truly asinine due to poor writing. So glad I don't pay for a Netflix subscription.

Just let the little girl dog around in the bullet wound hole. What a thoughtful adult. The robot wouldn't even harm her.

Because I feel like a good science fiction movie can make a big impact on one's imagination and how we perceive things moving forward in life. Or if it's just mediocre, it won't do any of that. So with this movie I would say it's the latter. It builds on a nice idea yet it never really lets you get immersed in the universe or makes you wonder.A girl is raised by a robot in the hopes of repopulating earth with smarter humans after an extinction.",I Am Mother
70,DeBBss,High Quality Film With a Low Budget,6,29 December 2020,"Pretty decent film overall, with a compelling plot that maintains your attention from beginning to end. It handles its themes quite well, with the whole guessing game aspect. The pacing is also quite good; the film never rushes with its plot, and nor did it drag.The acting by Clara Rugaard and Hilary Swank was realistic and very much believable. The characters were well developed and have some dimension to them. What's most impressive was how the budget was relatively low, and manages to offer high quality cinema. The CGI and set design was just really impressive for a 5 million dollar budgetI Am Mother is a definite recommendation from me. It's entertaining and it was constantly grabbing my attention. And the production was of the highest quality that you could get. If you've got the chance, give I Am Mother a watch.",I Am Mother

After reading reviews here I did bump my rating up 1 star, because it's really rather cleverly done.That said, a great idea doesn't make a perfect movie. And this movie is not perfect. It's slow, lacks any real emotion (at least for me) and the mystery wasn't incredibly interesting.

The director decides to salivate on fear reactions and expects the audience to as well.Every line from the robot mother is sickly bully or patronising, right from the beginning, which does not allow anyone in to get comfortable with the character, nor the girl.Flawed script, directing, editing... but the premise of the story is good.",I Am Mother
74,MogwaiMovieReviews,Hi Mom,6,25 May 2020,"I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well this was made: technically it's just about faultless: well shot and compellingly acted. It builds up great suspense and I really didn't know who I was supposed to be rooting for or trusting throughout, which in this case was a plus and kept me watching. The story really only falls down at the end, and the payoff doesn't really make sense or play fair. Looking back, too many details don't add up, and the premise as a whole seems exceedingly tenuous, unlikely and frustratingly unclear.For a 2019 film with an entirely female cast, it does a *relatively* good job of not rubbing that in too much with any overly-specific 'IT WAS WHITE MEN RUINED THE WORLD!' virtue signalling, but the humanity-hating SJW politics are subtly bubbling away in the background nonetheless: fathers (and their role in raising psychologically whole children and societies) are not factored into the scheme of things (or even mentioned, at all), and the one solitary male (baby) that appears at the end is, of course, black. We can assume it was his skin colour and not his gender that secured his place in the movie. These type of things are sadly mandatory in 2020, and it's hard to shake the feeling that the film would not have gotten greenlit without their inclusion. But having said all that, I have to admit I was fairly well-entertained by the first 80 minutes or so.",I Am Mother

76,WalkdenEntertainment,Sweet Mother!,6,16 June 2019,"A girl is born and raised in an underground, hi-tech facility. Her guardian, protector and mother is in fact a large talking robot programmed to do all things a Mother would do. With the outside world being far too dangerous to live in, the two form a close family-type bond as the girl grows from birth to a teenager. Their world and relationship becomes threatened when a lone, wounded survivor knocks on the door seeking help (played by Hilary Swank). As the film progresses, we find that relationships which were once strong become tested. Who is telling the truth? And who is telling the lies?I Am Mother is a fairly basic film with a small, all female cast of leads. Anyone who enjoys a B grade sci-fi film will find multiple things to praise throughout the film such the set design and the overall look and sound of this film. I also enjoyed the looks and movements of the Mother robot (particularly when it runs). I was surprised to find the voice of Mother was the Australian actress Rose Byrne (best known for her work in Bad-Neighbours and Bridemaids)Instantly I was impressed with the film's audio track. For a Netflix film, it's truly impressive, in particular with surround speakers. As a story, I Am Mother has a wonderful setup with the beginning introducing the audience to a fun sci-fi world and several characters. The film's ending is also extremely exciting as the elements unfold and the pieces come together. Despite this, somewhere in the middle the film slows down and wobbles for me.It's also around the 2nd act that audiences will raise a number of questions as characters make some ""out of left field"" choices. Naturally the film is trying to set up suspense and make us question which characters are actually good or bad, but I found the film struggling as to where to go from scene to scene and the same could be said as the film enters the final climax.Overall, this is a fairly exciting entry for sci-fi fans. Considering the amount of actors and budget the end results are generally impressive. As a story and film, I did find the film's half way mark a true struggle as everything slowed down and purposely dragged on far too long. I don't expect many fans to agree with me on my comments here, but I'm truly split on this. There's so much to love and so much I felt disappointed by. Either way, this film comes recommended for any sci-fi fans. Chances are you will cherish this film more than I did.6.1/10

78,songod-95003,To understand this you need a calculator,8,14 June 2019,"Since many here writing reviews have done the work already, all I will say is you need to have a calculator (or be very good at long division in your head) to figure out something is up.38 years pass from the time the robot in the lab creates what the first human after an ELE (Extinction Level Event) destroys the world we know and live in. However, the baby is only a teenager. Now NOT having a calculator by my side, I thought nothing of this. DID not have a clue regarding the shenanigans at foot till... reading a user review!This did not stop me from liking the movie, the acting, etc. The story was familiar, though. Pretty much a retelling of Frankenstein Meets Battlestar Galactica; where mankind builds robots that become smarter than them and kills them off. The difference is the robots want to create better more educated and civilized humans; therefore we have this expansive lab run by Mother loaded with thousands of human embryos. The super secret calculator needed ""twist"" is not evident without doing the math and did not necessarily detract.Some claim this is claustrophobic and at 2 hours is a chore. I did not experience that level of boredom or any actually. Enjoyable.",I Am Mother
79,ivanmessimilos,A real SF movie refreshment,8,27 March 2021,"Extremely unusual film for several reasons. This is a Netflix film, directed by Grant Sputore for whom this is the first and (so far) only film he has directed, and the number of actors is minimal. Given the budget, it's visually beautiful. It is a SF mystery with an interesting topic and requires your attention in order to connect all the clues and to make everything make sense to you in the end. So much about the movie, I wouldn't write anymore so as not to reveal something because the movie has an unexpected plot twist. Personally, I didn't know anything about the film or watch the trailer, so I recommend such a treatment to you. I will only write how in the first few seconds of the film we learn that the human race is extinct on Earth and how one robot tries to repopulate it. You can see the influence of other famous films that deal with a similar topic, and the film will probably prompt you to ask yourself some moral and philosophical questions. For me, this film is a real refreshment because the pace is a bit slower, but it still contains a few tense situations as well as asking for your attention so that after the last scene they would not ask themselves: What did I just watch!?",I Am Mother
80,bastos,Well done,7,25 November 2020,"Slickly made sci-fi thriller, with an intriguing setting and impressive visuals, manages to capture your attention from start to finish. One of the things that stands out immediately is the production design that is spotless, especially considering that this was a relatively low budget endeavor, and serves the story very well. The acting and directing are also good and the whole movie relies on a smart screenplay that takes some very common sci-fi themes but twists them enough to make it it's own thing. I do have some problems storywise, for example, Hilary Swank's motives and behavior throughout the movie are very questionable, even taking into consideration some of the twists. That did take some of the enjoyment away, but not enough to dismiss this title.",I Am Mother

The plot was fairly boring throughout its entirety, barring the slight tension we feel toward the antagonist. It all culminates into an ending that is far too absurd and poorly executed.",I Am Mother
82,harrylosborne,Boring conclusions veiled by moral dilemmas,5,26 June 2019,"In the same vein as Ex Machina's venture into trusting humans versus robots, I Am Mother poses the age-old question of who to believe when lives are on the line. I Am Mother also chooses to go about it in the most uninspired way, using tired tropes and obvious foreshadowing to hastily craft its dilemmas. Every action and ""twist"" crammed into this Netflix production is as predictable as the last - I found myself stating out loud the next obvious choice taken by ""Daughter"" (Clara Rugaard), and the supposedly complex plot was as linear as any I have seen in this genre.Boiled down, this story follows Daughter growing up in a post-apocalyptic earth under the watch of her robot ""Mother"" (Rose Byrne), constantly reminded that the rest of humanity has perished. Suddenly, with the arrival of a wounded human at the gates of their home (""Woman"", played by Oscar winner Hilary Swank), everything Daughter knows begins to be questioned. This develops a very interesting dynamic, where nobody can leave, but not do they want to coexist; on top of this, Mother and Woman both clearly need Daughter's support to achieve their obscured end goals. This is about as interesting as the film gets.From the arrival of Woman, flash visuals and sleek robotic designs can't save this very mediocre flick. Swank's performance is strong, but stands alone in a film devoid of any emotion. Most of the decisions Daughter makes are telegraphed, plus made further obvious by the blatant script writing to help the more disinterested viewer. Having said this, periods of the film will make absolutely no sense - little context given, and previous information shown to be completely falsified or totally irrelevant to the film. This only serves to annoy those trying to enjoy the film for its basic values, detracting from the diminutive viewing experience.Mother herself isn't a bad character, but still feels like too much emotion is afforded in her voice/mannerisms/obvious speech. The perfect voice for this scenario would be more akin to that of HAL 9000 (2001: A Space Odyssey) or GERTY (Moon) - emotionless, cold, and ideal for creating an atmosphere. At the end of the day, there just isn't the refinement here required to really make this worth the money they spent on it. Back to the drawing board for Netflix.",I Am Mother
83,tfminfl,"A.I. good, bad?",8,13 December 2019,"369. I Am Mother. Original Netflix sci movie movie time, so you know the apocalypse is about to erupt! And it does, but in this one we don't get to see it. Story takes place in a facility that automatically kicks on in case of a extinction level event type thing occurs, so day one, a robot wakes up walks over to a machine it pops open revealing human embryos, shoves it in the oven for 24 hours and boom, a baby, a female baby, that the robot cleverly names Daughter. The robot becomes the perfect mother, and raises the child to deal with humanity's future. The robot, now called Mother, is raising Daughter, to assist in the raising of her future brothers and sisters. And all is well, until the next karate kid comes pounding on the door. Against better judgement and of course Mother's strict instructions, Daughter goes ahead and lets the woman in, she's been injured, and when she meets Mother, well she's not too pleased, because she claims, a droid exactly like her put a bullet into her just a few moments ago. This sets of a huge series of events that reveals a whole lot of truths, a few twists and turns, with an ending that I thoroughly enjoyed.

85,Lewis_Heather787,Ok at best !,6,9 June 2019,"This film started off in the right direction, I'd say that the first 30 to 40 minutes were really interesting and gripping. Unfortunately though this film has ended up being not that exciting, new, fresh or that interesting at all in terms of story. Its sad because it had all the potential to be something a bit different but its just a bit cliche.Just because I thought the film was ok to average at best doesn't mean that there wasn't any aspects to it that I didn't like.I thought that the performances were fine across the board, obviously Clara Rugaard was very good in the lead role, she carried the film very well. Not seen her in anything before but she definitely will be on my radar in the future. Wasn't given a lot to do but she didn't look out of place. Hilary Swank was fine, I'm not a great fan of her if I'm being honest. Lastly I'd say that Rose Byrne's voiceover work was probably the highlight for me, she was extremely good. All over pretty good just nothing out of this world.The other positives for me are the special effects, production design and the score, which are all very good. The effects surrounding the robots are spectacular, it is very difficult to make out whether its completely CG , a practical suit or a mixture of both. Which ever it is, it is fantastic. The production design definitely gives off vibes of Blade Runner and Alien but with its own twist, its not a complete rip off, it adds to the films atmosphere. The score from start to finish is exactly what you want in a Sci-Fi film, very nicely done.However the biggest problem and let down for me personally is the story, which isn't original to say the least. Its just to predictable, as I was watching it I knew how events were going to go. The character choices/decisions are so easy to predict it just lost all the intensity and tension, the twists were just dull and bit boring. Nothing new or fresh, which is a real shame because the film started so well it just finished on this really predictable ending. Unfortunately there are so many science fiction films around that there all going to borrow from each other, however some still can surprise and amaze from time to time. This one borrowed a lot and didn't offer much new in return.Overall its 60% out of 100 or 6 out of 10, its ok but I expect more from Sci-Fi, maybe if this was released about 10 years ago would I have a different opinion....maybe I don't know. Performances are fine, effects great, production design good, score is fantastic. However with a really uninteresting and predictable story it goes out with a bit of a whimper. Nothing new , fresh or exciting. You're better off watching Blade Runner/2049, Interstellar, Arrival, High Life or something of that nature.......something with a bit more of a punch.",I Am Mother
86,Dragonsouls,Mind blowing cerebral Science Fiction !,9,11 June 2019,"This film will make you take a closer look at everything we've been told in prehistoric myth and bring it all together in a new world, a future world, where religious concepts such as immaculate conception is seen in the form of stem cells, gene editing and embryonic gestation chambers. It's a film that requires at least 3 viewings to soak it all in.In a sense, the story isn't exactly original. It is very reminiscent of Aronofsky's Mother, a film about the destruction and recreation of mankind, and the quest toward Utopia and perfection, and what has to be sacrificed in order to get there...the trial and errors of science, and trial and tribulations of the human spirit.Like few movies, I Am Mother had strong characters, fantastic acting, voice acting, art direction, cinematography and a very ambiguous and satisfying climax.

94,nezbitkn2,Ignore the bad reviews,8,15 June 2019,"Some of the reviews are annoying, I have to admit. This is a good film to watch start to finish and isn't as complicated as some make it sound.Basically, there has been an event which appears to have wiped out all of the human race. We then follow ""Mother"" raising an embryo to a teenager and teaching the way of the world as we would expect.However, a stranger suddenly turns up and claims to have been shot and needs help. ""Daughter"" lets her in and she then starts to convince her that the AI are murderers and are responsible for what has happened on earth.People keep on about the time and this that and the other. It become apparent when Daughter looks into the Kiln that there are fragments of dead bodies in there and from snooping around finds that she is hit a statistic in a line of clones; she being the most worthy of resurrecting life on the planet as an ideal person (mother's aim throughout).She then scatters with said stranger to realise that they merely all that are left in a world controlled by AI and flees to rescue her soon to be born ""brother"" from the life she has just lead.This film is a good watch and I've tried to not spoil it completely but with some reviews I felt the need to correct some.-The corn is being maintained and reproduced to enable a good start to the new human race when objective is fulfilled.
-The time doesn't make sense because it is not one embryo that is being seen in the earlier scenes.
-Mother merely wants to correct the world which she witnessed being damaged by the human race as it was.
-She kills the stranger at the end because she had gotten away from the annihilation she had brought upon earth and needed to clear this up before she could have any lasting negative effects on the new race.
-The ""contagion"" merely referred to the mind set of the human race before she intervened and didn't want outside persuasion to set them back in their goal.
-She looks at the end, with all of the embryos at her wrath, because she is thinking she is ""Eve"" and this world will be how she decides it is going to be.Not really rocket science.Anyway.Happy watching.",I Am Mother
95,MinistryofDoom,An Excellent Sci-Fi Film clearly inspired by the Classics,7,30 June 2019,"This was a great Sci-Fi/Fantasy film that left alot of question unanswered. Now don't take that as a criticism of the film because I feel like the questions did not necessarily need to be answered. What we are presented with is a slow burn mysterious science fiction drama set in an unknown future where robots are cultivating embryos in a high tech facility for some reason.One of the embryos is a young girl, simply known as ""Daughter"", who spent her entire existence within this facility, raised by a single solitary robot that she refers to as ""Mother"" (voiced by Rose Byrne). She spends her days learning about biology, medicine, science, critical thought, and spending her free time watching streaming videos of television programs from the past, notably The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. There are no other people or robots in the facility. Just ""Daughter"" and her ""mother"". At some point the girl begins to grow curious about her existence, asking questions that cannot...or should not...be answered. Her curiosity about life, if it exists, beyond the confines of facility begin to overwhelm her until she comes into contact with someone who claims to be from the outside, an unnamed injured woman played by Hilary Swank. This interaction between ""Daughter"" and ""Woman"" sets in motion a psychological conflict between the 3 leads.In the end, several questions are left unanswered and our introduction to the world of ""I Am Mother"" is just a small slice of life in a larger mysterious narrative. This is a pure science fiction film that requires thought and introspection. It is along the lines of great Sci-Fi films such as Alien, Blade-Runner, or 2001: A Space Odyssey, and clearly inspired by them. Otherwise, if you are looking for a fast-paced, guns-blazing sci-fi action film. This is not it.",I Am Mother

its one time TV level movie. very simple and border dumb story with a poor cast for main role. great to see Swank working again but thats not enough for anything above 5.
i am not sure i even need to go into contless stupiditys of robot-human cooperation here . but plot contradictions like that without genetic altering human will continue to deviate and what then again killing all of them? there goes mother reasoning. and all together what was the point of the movie? trust robots? be better human? whatever reasoning was they sure made all the wrong story decisions.

97,royhectorkabanlit,"Well Acted, Great Tension and Mystery, but Flawed Ending",8,9 June 2019,"The movie does a great job of creating tension, of making the audience guess about what the true intentions of Woman (Hilary Swank's character) and Mother (voiced by Rose Byrne) really are.There's basically just two actresses and one voice actress, but they were all phenomenal, which is a big part of why the movie worked. For a fairly unknown actress internationally, Clara Rugaard did an amazing job matching up with the two time Oscar Award winner Hillary Swank.The ending was kinda off, though. How Swank's character got into the bunker was kinda hazy, although it was later revealed that it was all part of Mother's grand plan, but that was not explained as clearly or as good enough for me.And how Daughter convinced Mother to raise the rest of humanity I also felt a bit weak.

Though I eventually caught on to what was happening it wasnt straight away. There werent many humans in it but that didn't spoil the film. Good to watch something original for a change.,I Am Mother
99,phoenixinvictus,It reveals itself too soon,4,10 June 2019,"I am mother is about an AI who is a mass murder with a God complex and who is... well-psychotic. In fact this movie should be called I am a psychopath. What this AI did was genocide on a global scale and then decided to play God to recreate the world in its image. The story itself wasn't as bad as it was too long once we understand what has happened. It was the usual cliché of an AI who uses faulty logic to ""wipe out mankind before it can destroy itself"". In order to save mankind from extinction it has to cause its extinction? I never did understand that. Mother, the AI using a robot avatar, tries to teach her human daughter virtues, morals and ethics yet butchered the entire human race. Mother has no humanity in it because we discover that Daughter either succeeds or she is incinerated with her failure in a bizarre twisted eugenics program for breeding humans from embryos. These are not the qualities of a true mother or of an intelligent being. I'm rather tired of this overused and abused plot line of an AI going nuts and kill all mankind in a ridiculous logical fallacy. I was looking forward to seeing an AI trying to save mankind and become the ""mother"" of a new era. Instead I ended up watching the same old boring plot of other stories about the Terminator and the Matrix.
This movie tries so hard to be clever that it creates a serious plot hole. For instance, if Woman (brilliantly played by Hillary Swank) was allowed to live because she's part of Mother's plan involving the extinction and repopulation of the planet then why was she tortured to discover the whereabouts of the other humans? We are aware that Mother has wide-ranging surveillance capabilities and absolute control of the facility-not to mention that she has a heavily-armed robot army. There is nothing that Daughter does that doesn't go unnoticed by Mother. It just seems counterproductive for Mother to sow seeds of doubt in Daughter about AI's. In the end, the future human race/family is going to need technology and the droids to survive and repopulate the world. So creating distrust in robots seems tremendously problematical and pointless. I sincerely didn't understand the final scene with Swank's character and Mother. It truly seems set on simply creating danger and ambiguity before the final credits.",I Am Mother
100,eelen-seth,Who will you trust?,7,4 June 2019,"In I Am Mother, we find ourselves in a dystopian worlds where all human life has been wiped out. It's Day 1 and Daughter (Clara Rugaard) is born from a frozen embryo. 6,000 days later, she's a young woman taking personality exams and is training to be a doctor. A robot (made by the amazing Weta Workshop) voiced by Rose Byrne is her Mother. She can show a wide range of believable emotions and can move just like humans do.The production design is the film's highest selling points, with its Apple-ish slickness. Its scenario isn't that groundbreaking, but it's the way it's executed that makes this an interesting watch. At some point, Daughter goes on a little stroll through the big bunker and decides to open the locked vault doors out of curiosity. She hears cries for help and a lost Woman (Hilary Swank) seems to have been shot and in need of care. Daughter lets her in, and soon finds out she doesn't really like droids, in a violent show-off. Daughter finds herself caught in the middle of two worlds - will she stay loyal to her protector or is she too intrigued by the unknown and ready to throw everything she knows overboard?Science-fiction has never looked more slick and that's mainly because of Mother. The attention to detail is praiseworthy, as is its sound design. You can't help but look at every corner just to see something new and innovative. Even the make up department deserves a high five. Clara Rugaard who plays Daughter, outshines Hilary Swank with ease. Her acting seems effortless and natural, reminiscent of Hailee Steinfeld.I Am Mother is mostly about what it means to be good. It tries to show us how AI might try to understand kindness in a world where people only seem to want more and push themselves into extinction. Swank's character tries to make Daughter question herself and her beliefs and shows just how powerful an outsider can be that gives you another look at life. The film is also about parenting and how every parent can fail at what they think is best for their child.Australian director Grant Sputore's debut film gives us a dramatised look at humans and our love-hate relationship with artificial intelligence. Its thriller aspect on a mysterious apocalyptic event makes it all the more interesting, when figuring out what Mother's actual intentions are.Review by Seth Eelen",I Am Mother

The mother has a collection of fetuses preserved in good conditions,and every once in a while the robot takes a fetus and triggers his growth process. The robot raises the baby with high ethics and cleverness to create a better human race. The now grown up girl let's someone inside despite the warning from the mother no to,on the assumption that humanity is effected by a form of contagious disease.

Some heavy doses of ethical philosophy get thrown our way that end up being integral to the major plot points in the film. The film gives us just enough hints to help us figure out where it's going until some twists change the usual course of action, especially the magnificent ending, for which the meaning of the title completely changes. This whole film revels in the glory that is motherhood.The trifecta of acting between Rose Byrne, Clara Rugaard and Hillary Swank is something jot to be missed.So far this is up there with Upstream Color and Upgrade as best sci-fis of the 2010s. It's the second best film of 2019 behind The Lighthouse (from what I've seen).",I Am Mother

In a good way, where you keep coming back to learn more. It's prime example of mature science fiction. Asimov at its finest. The story is simple, but the ideas are meaningful and thought-provoking.Hillary Swank was great in this, as was the girl. They looked like mother and daughter. The robot design is slick, and the production design, though small in size compared to big budget flicks, is utilized perfectly. Good sci-fi requires an enticing idea, a great screenplay, good and inventive production design and good acting. I Am Mother has all this, and some soul sprinkled on top. I would put this among the ranks of Ex Machina when it comes to great ideas being executed well. Even Cube, one of my all-time favorites.I Am Mother was definitely worth my time. It was never boring, never too long or too hard on exposition. Movies like this require paying close attention and seeing what is shown, not just hearing what is said. This is the equivalent of Kant's philosophy making love to Asimov's ideas about humanity and AI.",I Am Mother

109,Dannyboi94,A visually impressive Sci-fi thriller,8,7 June 2019,"I am Mother is a gorgeous looking movie, there was times where I couldn't tell if I was seeing CGI or particle effects, which just goes to show, that you don't need a big budget to make a movie like this.Without spoiling the movie, I am Mother takes place within a facility, and for most of the movie, you follow a young woman as she is raised by a highly intelligent AI. Now a movie like this can get boring, but like movies such as Ex Machina, I am Mother always keeps you interested. While some may find the film boring due to its slow plot, those who enjoy good sci-fi thrillers that are slow burners, will find a great deal of enjoyment from this film.The main lead, played by Clara Rugaard, gives a brilliant performance. And considering that she is unknown, and going head to head with a powerhouse like Hilary Swank, shows how much of a talented young actress that she is. The robot voiced by Rose Byrne is the highlight of the movie, as it is very difficult during most of the movie, to try and understand if it means bad or good, and that is due to the clever writing and directing.I am Mother is a very entertaining movie, and many will love it if they enjoy movies like it, but many more may find it boring.

And that's exactly what happened, without much originality. There are half a dozen Star Trek episodes with the same premise of someone living in a setting without realizing there's a great big world out there. The Truman Show. So many others.
Besides it's standard premise, I Am Mother is exceptionally annoying because of the way Daughter behaved. She had everything she ever wanted in life, and she turned on the one ""person"" who cared for her. You have the choice of an easy life with all the food and drink you want, and you get to watch comedians on TV all day long. OR...you can take a chance to go live with a bunch of filty people hiding in a mine, with nothing to eat. She made the wrong choice, and she compounded it by making more and more wrong choices.

It is in the ""two or three people in an isolated environment with a robot and insidious stuff going on"" subgenre of sci-fi. Other films in this subgenre include Ex Machina and Moon. I loved those movies, and I loved this too! In the future, some kind of apocalyptic disaster has taken place and one robot named Mother is tasked with growing and raising humans to repopulate the planet. The film follows Mother's only child, Daughter, and her desire to know what lies beyond the walls of the facility she was born and raised in. It kind of sounds like a The Little Mermaid or Hotel Transylvania setup, but it gets really crazy from there. This film is very moody and atmospheric. It's cold, claustrophobic and tense, but also cozy, warm and inviting. It makes you feel so many different things. The story is very engaging. The performances are all great except for Daughter's child actor at the very beginning, and the effects are excellent! The CGI and sets look great, but the best part of this movie is Mother. She is not CGI. She is an animatronic suit. She's awesome! She looks better than any of the robots out of the recent Star Wars movies! I'd say this movie is worth seeing for her alone, but the rest of the movie around her is so good that I think that would be doing the film a disservice. Honestly, there's not much I can say about this movie without giving things away so I think I'll just leave things there.

Don't expect 2001 or anything, it's not even in the same league, but it's a reasonably good watch if you enjoy films you have to think about to fully appreciate.

119,marydm-43470,A masterclass in minimalism.,10,14 June 2019,"Did Ms Swank say that the director of this movie was the next Christopher Nolan? With all due respect to your senior star status, Ms Swank, this director is already waaay beyond some of the most revered names in the cinematic sci-fi pantheon. This movie packs serious wallop with its directness, simplicity and choosing to develop incredibly complex and interesting characters over gee-wizz CGI moronic special effects.
I've seen hundreds of sci-fi and fantasy movies, and it is rare indeed to have so few characters populate the screen and yet have both the screen and the whole duration of the movie seem utterly filled with narrative, dramatisation and above all depth and complexity of characterisation.
Ms Byrne does a superp job of voicing ""mother"", achieving tonal complexity to the extent that we forget we're watching a ""Droid"". No sterile metallic monotone here, but full emotional nuance. Ms Swank is equally impressive in her understated presence of the ""antagonist"". But the movie belongs to the young actress who plays ""daughter"". She is a revelation. She's on the screen the whole time but she possesses such emotional range, and such control of facial and body language, that we can simply not get enough of watching her flesh out an absolutely ""instant classic"" screen character.
A concept movie, done with restraint and simplicity, respecting proven cinematic techniques and the intelligence of the viewer.

128,Mike_O_Dwyer,Mother Complex,7,10 June 2019,"For the most part I Am Mother feels more like a three handed play between Mother, Daughter, Woman, than anything else. The film is a bit heavy handed when it comes to the slight story, a basic premise about making a choice between nature and nurture, with a dystopian future as the setting - it could almost be set in any period with a few adjustments.The Mother AI robot looks particularly well, sleek design and Rose Byrne's voice giving it an almost human sense of curiosity. With its limited indoor bunker environment there's not much scope to build a world, but what is on show tends towards the clean-room antiseptic rather than the run down by daily use.Mother is caretaker to 60,000 human (cloned?) embryos in storage after some apocageddon event, passing the time by picking one at a time to bring into the world in 24 hours via the advanced AI bio-engineering of script necessity. Daughter duly specialises in ballet, doctoring, and placing stickers on Mother. Development is monitored by Mother carrying out Myers Briggs assessments and an updated version of MIT's online Moral Machine test - which is always fun to try out. Rugaard's Daughter is obviously a very obedient child who has been raised by mother not to leave a mark on anything, ever. She is smart but dull. Like Mother raised her to be. Mostly.Into this happy? scenario drops Swank's Woman to upscuttle things. Daughter becomes conflicted. Choices have to be made. Yadda yadda.I Am Mother suffers from that 'Cloverfield' almost-but-not-quite vibe of films trying to make a mark for themselves by relying on a twist that no one sees coming, except, as with most 'surprises', this one falls flat because it has too much of so what about it.Everyone does a decent job, but I Am Mother never rises above it's own limitations.",I Am Mother

130,daniele-iannarelli,Biting the hand that feeds you...,7,24 June 2019,"Interesting film, good idea... but flawed.The first half is a mix between slow-paced and intrigue. When 'Mother' is first introduced to us, I couldn't help feel that her locomotion was a bit too human-like, and consequently kept thinking ""That's a woman dressed in a robot suit!"".Anyway, the film did hold my interest even though it became a little silly at times. When the Swank character turned up injured, the type of trauma presented (bullet lodged between the acetabulum and the femoral head), there is no way on God's Earth she'd have been able to put any weight at all on that leg/hip, and yet not only does she manage to hobble around on it but her recovery rate is absolutely phenomenal!It's also a bit unbelievable that ""Daughter"" is willing to leave her comfortable, safe environment to which she knows no different, murdering her 'mother' in the process and thence having to fend for herself and her new 'brother' all alone.The basic moral suggests that humans nature is inherently corrupt and duplicitous. Judging by daughter's action later in the film, it's also quite hypocritical. Surely - even though inanimate - having been raised all her life by ""Mother"", she'd have developed some sort of love for it, but no... she shows human nature's true colours by acting herself like a Droid, and committing murder.Bottom line is that there seemed no real need to 'kill' mother, except perhaps out of vengeance for the death of mankind. The latter presents quite a conflict between an interesting, veiled reference to the Virgin Mary throughout, suggesting a warped, comparison with ""mother"". The bringer of death versus the bringer of life within the one inanimate 'being'.There are a few open ends though, for example:i. What happened to the dog?
ii. What happened at the end to all the Droids cutting their way in?
iii. Did all the Droids die? If so, was their destruction synchronous with the death of ""Mother""?Overall, the film is okay - I'm reluctant to say it, but quite good actually - mainly from a conceptual viewpoint.It's acted pretty well by Clara Rugaard, as ""Daughter"", and Swank is competent as ""Woman"".I had decided on a 6/10, but I'm tempted to award a 7/10, believing that the current IMDB rating of 6.8 is actually about right for this.So... on this occasion I'll give the benefit of the doubt and apply a 7/10.",I Am Mother
131,ianwagnerwatches,a new-ish take on an old idea,6,21 July 2019,"The first two acts of the film were great. Visually pleasing, well written, and rich with atmosphere-a feeling that things are more than they seem. This feeling carried me through the first hour or so of the film, before the film approached its end, at which point the magic was gone and the world started to make less sense. The film even fell of visually, a bit.The resolution was a bit underwhelming, even a bit silly. I hate to be so harsh, but as I said, the first hour of this film gave me such high expectations. I never could confidently guess the motives of the antagonist, and I was infinitely curious about the bigger world, about the whole truth beyond the small space we are shown. It wasn't the world that let me down, but the plot. In my opinion, it took too many liberties regarding my suspension of disbelief, and in the end I was too distracted by them to remain immersed. I was also hoping for a more thought provoking ending, and was let down.However, to anyone who isn't terribly familiar with science fiction, I would highly recommend this film.

Every effort made through this movie went away like a faint squeak in a windy day, just because of the last few (2 to 3) minutes!The writer/or the director seemed to have incorrectly relied too much upon the sense of drama accumulated in the audience, and used that in the worst form possible.

The CGI is good for the most part, there are a couple of scenes where you wonder if they didn't take it as seriously as they should have or 'rushed it'!The story, of course, is the heart of all movies. The big issue with this one is that it is deep and you have to be on your guard at all times because the pieces (as daniel-33683 points out) are all there, you just need to see them. The concept is pretty darned clever, although the 'holes' that are present really do not need plugging, if anything they add to the overall mystique.Clara Rugaard creates an exceptionally believable character and Hilary Swank just does as good a job as always.Synopsis: A good movie as long as you watch closely and enjoy paying attention to detail.

But it was the equivalent of taking a very good suspense thriller book and ripping out the last chapter. This is the type of movie I really despise. A beginning.. and a middle.. and oh so close to an end. Then the credits roll. Did I like what there was? Yes. But these are movies, and a movie without an end (for me) is incomplete. I go to movies for entertainment.. for the writers and director and production people to create a COMPLETE story, not to ""imagine how it might have ended""",I Am Mother
138,amirmustafaa,An Interesting Small-Scale Sci-Fi Thriller,7,17 July 2019,"I Am Mother is definitely one of the better movies I've seen come from Netflix. Its a very familiar yet interesting movie about ethics and artificial intelligence. It has very good performances, and Mother is one of the more interesting (and terrifying) robots I've seen in a Sci-Fi movie in a while. My only problem with the movie is the third act. I thought it could've been handled better, and this movie would've greatly benefited from going more in depth with Hillary Swank's character and Mother's overall plan.",I Am Mother
139,caramia2002,"Redux, redux, redux",4,14 August 2019,"I really thought I was in for a, long awaited, thoughtful, true sci-fi (not action movie under thinly veiled sci-fi) film when this movie began. I was hooked so much at the beginning that I put my phone down for a long time. But then the deficiencies began...1) Religion - And Catholic, at that. Doesn't have any place in sci-fi, esp set way in the future. Imagine 2001, Blade Runner, etc, with religious scenes/icons... 'Nuf said. There isn't much, but it's a repetitive theme which began with HIllary Swank's rosary and ended with a few altar scenes with Mother Mary (""Mother""? lame). I could find no valid story reason to stick that in, so conclude that it was propaganda. Oh yessss...and they use ""abortion"" when the correct term would be ""genocide""/""murder""/""liquidation"". I was under the impression that ""abortion"" referred to fetuses... You have to wonder if these two things were connected, not to get all conspiracy theory on it.2) Robot Design - OMG, really? A human in a robot suit? And walking is the best way for a robot to navigate? The only time robot designers go that route is novelty, to make us feel better, and while that may have been a valid story line (raising humans requires ""human"" looking robots (but it really doesn't)?), it was thin and just a dumb, George Lucas/Spielberg device, although her hand was very good and was featured well.3) Slow, slow, slow - The 2nd and 3rd acts screech to a halt. I started looking for my phone. Typical Netflix issue. They hate to leave anything on the cutting room floor, esp if they paid a lot for the fx (Weta Digital).4) Speaking of Weta - Although there were several fx companies involved... some really bad mistakes and obvious green screen. Why did Woman and Daughter seem to be walking across a Google Map or satellite pic, 800 times too big? Are we really that dumb? Weta is a great and former ground breaking fx company based in New Zealand (Lord of the Rings), but they always seem to have too many errors, no matter who is directing.5) Derivative - To the max. Battlestar Gallactica 2004 (the gyno factory episode plus the whole plot is robots, robots, skin jobs), Matrix, Blade Runner, Chappie, Ex Machina, AI. Esp BSG and The Matrix. But they messed up the Red Pill part and end twist. Why oh why can't anyone make an original sci-fi movie? It's not like there's a lack of great sci-fi novels and short stories out there (see the two recent anthology series)...buy a great novel and then get out of the way. The 3rd act mattes are almost identical to BSG, AI and a couple other movies. Can't they get sued for that?6) Dumb Stuff - Like Mother can't scan the facility for humans or has a constant Wi-Fi connection to Daughter at all times? Just how huge is that facility, anyway? Lot of endless robot running when suspense is needed. Access to the airlock is so, so easy, esp from the outside? Mother can't be ""killed"", except when it is necessary for the story (and not sure even then due to nonsensical ending). Give me a break.7) CUT - The End - Too many movies these days don't know how to end and do so when the proper length is reached or writer has painted self into a corner, whichever comes first. This film is one of the worst and has one of the most terrible and nonsensical ending frames ever. No ""there"" there.8) Overacting - Granted, some challenging issues as much was done to nobody or green screen, but Hillary Swank seemed like a hick meth mom (plus her dialogue was just atrocious, so what could she do?). Daughter's actor was capable but overdid it in the ingenue expression area. Eyebrows, eyebrows, eyebrows. STOP. The Mother voiceover was good, if not toooo human, but see BSG, where that actually worked. Sadly, this isn't BSG. Or gladly.The one thing you can usually count on with Netflix productions is that they are weak. Oh there are some exceptions, but a terribly low %. Which is why I periodically leave them for that other big streaming service I really hate to give my money to. But NF never seems to get it. All those gillions of $, casts, and directors wasted...I am amazed that no reviewer I read made any connection to eugenics (Nazis favorite hobby) in this film. Perhaps that shows that I am old and people are woefully uneducated about these things (""a better human"", duh). The writers did everything but have the actors hold signs with eugenics talking points on them. So that teaching moment went over everyone's head...and it was one of the more worthwhile things in the film.",I Am Mother

However, what other interesting points can this movie deliver? The storyline is boring with lazy and predictable dialogue. The acting isn't great either, the daughter who has been raised by a robot, acts like a dumb teenager. Perhaps the robot (mother) acting is the most convincing.

Minimal cast to keep costs down and high production values once again produce a hit.As expected, things aren't what they seem but they aren't the obvious opposite either. The director does a brilliant job of moving your thinking one way then the other several times and when the ending comes a clue or two then clicks into place (or not if you didn't see them). Either way it's a well wrapped up ending that befits the tension created. Full credit to the writer for imagining this as well as the director for realising it. It's not often that the viewer isn't treated like an idiot these days and the avoidance of the obvious is thoroughly appreciated by this viewer.It must put a lot on the actors when there are so few of them and both main characters respond marvellously with exceptional performances.

I'm sure we probably would have liked it more from the comfort of our living room, instead of in the theatre. It was an intriguing premise, with lots of interesting questions raised, but it was also kind of slow and lumbering at times. Clara Rugaard was terrific as Daughter, though, and Hilary Swank gave her grimiest best as the intruder (and only other human in the film). The biggest takeaway for me was the philosophical question raised about a doctor and whether he should save five lives or just one.

When the daughter comes into contact with that outside world, the story start to roll. That's all the plot I will reveal, so the rest remains a surprise to you.The film has a simple, almost art-like quality to the steel sci-fi environment. It has only a handful of female actresses who carry it. That makes it smart and very well paced. It's also highly original in the choices it makes. Yes, it has morality, but not in the way you think. Despite its dark setting, I found its ideas very refreshing.The symbolism and twists toward the ending gave it a lot more power than I thought it would have. It's a real, unexpected crescendo. And if you really have your mind switched on, you'll find yourself wondering which side of the moral divide you should be. I myself, ended up making a choice I had never expected.It's a thinker, it has power, the setting is flawless, and so are the performances. The music could have been a little more outspoken, but that is a problem of films in general these days. This is a surprisingly good movie that every sci-fi lover should have under its belt.Powerful.",I Am Mother
152,Behnam-A,Brilliant and intelligent,8,15 August 2019,"Without speaking directly about the plot which has been explained by other reviewers, I'd like to talk about a highly possible allegorical story behind the plot. The movie could be very well about the law and the society structure.There are many hints to support that idea in the movie. I think the movie is explaining the way people and societies have been trying to make better ways of living generation after generation and yet based on basic philosophies from the past. Another sociological element is the struggle between human's rational mind which tries to make required rules for maintaining a healthy society and instincts that bond him to his nature of being completely free (the dog) along with his irrational but hopeful habits from the very old times (religion). Also the movie is showing the harsh way that rules treat with the outlaws (the ones who doesn't match) and the difficulties to avoid the mismatch because of human's unpredictable nature. And then finally the future generation which is still unknown if it could be successful or not even after these all hard works (the new mother is still a human and despite her being ready and accepted by the robot, she could still fail).I think even if audience don't catch this sides in the first look they can still feel it. You will sense something familiar, bothering, and somehow hopeful. This movie is not a perfect one without any flaws of course so I can't call it a masterpiece or give it titles like that, but it is still very brilliant and worthy. Just go watch it and enjoy an original wonderful work.",I Am Mother

173,derbo73,A movie with true AI,8,17 February 2021,"Which alone is rare. This movie is about what exactly makes humans human and what's the difference between a human and an artificial intelligence. It#s hard to digest that humans are always subject to their biological construction. Our persona, will, emotions, needs and intellect are inseparable connected with our biological brains and bodies. That's why uploading a human consciousness or personality into cyberspace will always be fiction. We are not simply zeros and ones. AI is. It is free of the troubles of emotions, it will have a hard time understanding the irrational behaviour of humans. It will see our brains and our very construction as flawed. Not sustainable and capable of surviving the coming eons. The mission was to shape humans into something that will be able to survive as a race for longer than a few hundred or thousand years, despite multiplying and killing it's cradle. And that's where the movie has some problems. It assumes that AI will be able to create a better human, able to control emotions and make more rational decisions, therefore treat each other and the environment more responsible. And I dare say, that's not possible with biological humans. It's not that you would only have to make some minor fixes to the brain. The entire construction and way human bodies/minds work would have to be changed. Creating something that we would no longer call humans or recognizes as our successors. This ""Vulcans are better Humans, because they made that essential evolutionary step"" concept is fantasy. From all that we know about humans and how human brains, intelligence and consciousness work, this will not happen. And an AI would have foreseen that or found out long ago, stopping those futile attempts. The Daughter in the movies may be a slightly better human version for now, the entropy during reproduction and teaching successor geerations will eventually create something that the AI will no longer accept again. The human race will have to face it's limits in the evolutionary cyle one day and make way to something entirely new, no longer human. This movie could have dealt with that easily, as a cliffhanger for example. But it would have enhanced the already dark theme and topic. Most people don't want to talk or think about things like that, they keep denying the facts and try to believe, that eventually things will get better. Like only humans do.",I Am Mother

When i watched it lately - i was quite satisfied with the story.This is a very condensed story .. with ""only"" 3 protagonists. There is .. at least in my opinion .. no good or bad - just interpretations of it. - Something that makes the movie work for me.
The subject of the story is an old one. The greater good vs. the personal good; the vanishing of ethical lines and morality - when it really counts, not as a thought experiment.Each protagonists position is well build, is traceable and .. does make sense.The conclusion is - about as unexpected as expected - ""for the greater good"" - or is it?Acting was good .. although not too subtle. With extreme emotions replacing what could have been a more subtle approach, more nuanced and philosophical one ... the movie misses out a little.It would have been nice to see more of the shaping of the one protagonist - to understand more of her decisions (which seemed out of place, considering her entire life experience and focus points)All in all .. i give this a 8/10 ... although, more objectively it may be a 7/10 .. because more time with the character would have been helpful - then again it is a harsh thing to say, considering she has around 99% of the screentime.",I Am Mother
175,starving_college_student,Well made but not as smart as it thinks it is,6,14 July 2019,"I Am Mother is well made and well acted - it's very watchable to say the least. The idea is also interesting (repopulating the human race via an artificial mother), albeit not new. The real problem is the story (or direction) really wants this to be a suspenseful journey even when it's not truly clear what the bigger picture is. Any information of what is going on in the world outside is purposefully leaked to the viewer in bits and blurbs so as to lead up to the typical big reveal. This unfortunately makes some actions make little rational sense and in the end, it makes the 'woman from outside' (APX1) really confusing. Which leads to the last point - the film thinks it is intelligent, but it's really not. It has all the pieces but the way the puzzle is put together, not everything fits. I guessed that 'the woman from outside' was some kind of incarnation of APX3 about halfway through (a bit after she entered the infirmary). The pieces to this later confirmed my guess (the APX1-3 embryoes, etc), but it didn't make much sense with the story she told daughter (other humans, mines, etc) plus why would she not remember this facility if she is from it, why would she want to take daughter out of the facility, what does her being so religious have to do with anything, plus a ton of other questions that arise if that is the case (which it is pretty clearly it is by the purposefully ambiguous alt-mother droid entering the cargo container in the end and saying the woman from outside was part of her plan all along). The film/story is trying so hard for that 'gotcha' twist, but it turns out more convoluted than clever (and I think some people will miss the APX1 thing all together).

179,tennismenace,Absolutely loved this movie,10,12 August 2019,"Very intelligent and makes you want to talk to someone to discuss what you just viewed. That makes for a great movie in my book. The acting was fine although basically you only had a teenage girl, a robot, and Hillary Swank for a little while. But like I said, the true greatness in this movie is the strong storyline. I'm sure this will not be for everyone (people who prefer mindless action or sappy love stories), but for those who particularly love this genre, you won't be disappointed.",I Am Mother
180,pipedpiper,Unbelievable cliche after cliche,1,8 June 2019,Sorry I watched it just such a boring waste of time I seen Many science fiction movies of the same genre can't understand when there's so much good science fiction out there they chose this one my recommendation is don't bother watching,I Am Mother
181,ibimac-570-374265,Very impressive Sci Fi,10,11 June 2019,"I really enjoyed this film. It was an original premise, under played, with no ridiculous scenarios or Hollywood clap trap. The directing was faultless and considering there's only 3 actors (one being just a voice) in the whole movie it kept me intrigued. The main character was very good. I'm not revealing the plot as it would spoil the movie but I would definitely recommend it as it's not your usual sci fi.Thoroughly enjoyable A+",I Am Mother
182,Erlik_Han,Absolutely BRILLIANT Sci-fi movie that's criminally underrated!,10,10 June 2019,"So when I first saw this pass by on Netflix the premise seemed uninteresting. I checked IMDb and the mediocre score almost stopped me from watching it but the trailer was really good. So decided to give this a chance.I'm blown away! I was worried the trailer had spoiled most of the plot and usually I'm really good at guessing what's going to happen next. But this movie is full of surprises, twists and turns that are unexpected. If you like sci fi movies, absolutely give this movie a chance! The acting is brilliant, the visuals are brilliant, the plot is brilliant! And I've just developed the biggest crush on Clara Rugaard. Not only is she an incredible actress showing a wide range of believable emotions, she is jaw droppingly pretty.My ONLY wish was that the movie was 4k and HDR/Dolby Vision. Because of the many darker scenes/locations and bright lights HDR would have take this visually beautiful movie and made it even more impressive.",I Am Mother
183,gideonzack,A Masterpiece,10,8 June 2019,"This film is true science fiction. Forget all the dead bodies and crazy action, this could happen. What is humanity? What is a mother? What is going to happen to humanity? What is good and what is evil? A true gem. I need to rewatch this again because there's a lot to digest. Enjoy!!",I Am Mother
184,cary_howe,Losing my sense of humor about rip offs,1,2 October 2021,"I'm sure it's considered a spoiler but the film is essentially the most blatant Terminator rip off I;ve ever seen. The main difference is this one is set after Skynet wins and it wants to recreate ""perfect"" humans. That's the film and I just saved you two hours. Oh, Skynet wins in the end. There, I really did save you two hours. Even the hunterkiller designs were ripped off of Terminator. Funny how Netflix spends tens of millions making these rip offs and won;t spend ten cents on ANYTHING original! Time to cancel Netflix again......",I Am Mother
185,attennessee,sublime,8,10 June 2019,"Such a beautiful movie. flawless acting, great pace, strong directing, tight editing.so scary when mother comes bolting down those halls -- metal banging against metal -- holy crap.awesome supporting score (subtle yet effective). sets and setting look expensive and authentic. great attention to detail. completely coherent. intelligent hints so you're brought along and don't feel duped. loved the ending. just a pleasure to watch from beginning to end; no breaks needed. saw it again a day later cause it's just that good!!one of those movies i wish i could watch again for the first time. 8/10",I Am Mother
186,penofinspiratin,Great movie though it can leave you with questions more than answers,8,14 June 2019,From confusion to suspense the movie paints a great picture about AIIt's more of the matrix with a twist of terminator.The question isWho created the AI.Will she destroy failing embryos?,I Am Mother
187,UltraMaximal,Unimaginable and Repetitive Tripe,1,7 June 2019,"There is absolutely nothing original here. This is exactly like ""Moon"" ""Saturn 3"" and so many other dull movies about tech succeeding where humans fail.",I Am Mother
188,palistineroyal,Movie was interesting,6,16 August 2019,"I understood the foreshadowing in the movie but I never caught on the last part until I read reviews. Without saying much I didn't like how they ended it considering Hillary Swank's character was born and raised first. How did mother erase her memory? and how did she find survivors? We're they false memories too? If so how long was she outside and why or how did they know she'd be around the sanctuary to complete the plan? Or for that matter in time to allow Daughter enough time to be ready. Too many plot holes, I was gonna rate a seven but as I'm reading this I realized there were more plot holes. Minus 4 for every plot hole",I Am Mother
189,lacatusalexandru,I Am Mother-The Best SF Movie Ever,10,14 December 2019,"""I am mother"" has all the things a great sf movie needs to have(great script,beautiful CGI Effects and a great cast)
Some movies from this genre have the tedancy to relay too much on CGI effects and less on the story,but not this movie.
What I did not like too much was the ending and that's because it's not a clear ending or a bad/good one,it's a bit mysterious.
Overall,""I Am Mother"" is the best Sf movie from 2019.",I Am Mother
190,sagniknath,A surprisingly refreshing Robot based movie with some food for thought as well,9,16 June 2019,"I don't know if this is a phenomenon that has been widely observed or not but nowadays, Hollywood barely makes what we can traditionally call a "" Robot"" movie, that is a movie that has an actual robot as a central character . Most SF films that involve robots these days mainly have them as motion capture based CGI extras or grunts. When it comes to representing artificial intelligence, these movies instead tend to focus on a central computer or a hive mind as the complimenting character. Even the later Terminator movies tended to flesh out the evil Skynet software as a tangible antagonist more than any individual T800 robot unit. Possibly the last major Hollywood movie to mainly revolve around a robot character and devote actual animatronics and suit design to it was Bicentennial Man, and that was way back in 1999.So the very first thing that delighted me in I Am Mother was to see the revival of the classic actor in a robot suit formula . Mother 's suit is very convincing and clearly has been inspired by the numerous popular real life humanoid robots in existence today. She seemed very reminiscent of the humanoids from Boston Dynamics. Because there was an actual robot performer on set with suit on, I could tell how convenient it was for the other actors to interact with it and give more engaging performances. Contrast this to more recent robot films like Chappie where the mo cap based CGI is convincing enough but there is always that uncanny feeling somewhere in our minds that these robots are really not tangible.So much about the robot suit. The plot accompanying it was pretty well done as well. Elaborating on it might devolve into spoiler territory so I won't go that route. Basically, in a supposedly post apocalyptic environment, one sole robot, Mother has set up a sealed sanitary lab to grow a human embryo and rear it up as a child. The actor in the Mother suit was great and really sold me his character of a robot tending to each and every need of the child from infancy to adolescence. The main premise of the movie, as Mother herself keeps reminding her ""daughter"", is to see whether she has been successful enough in making a fine exemplary human out of the girl so that she can restart human civilization. And this premise actually leads to its conclusion in the ending as well , leaving enough enough food for thought as to whether Mother was successful in her mission or not.Hillary Swank is pretty good in her role as well. It really is a pity that Hollywood does not provide such a genuine actor with mainstream performances of late. She reminded me a lot of Linda Hamilton's performance as Sarah Connor in Terminator 2. Speaking of T2, this film has a very nice reference to it.Overall, I am happy that I didn't pass up on this film on Netflix and I would recommend it .",I Am Mother
191,dmgreer,"Clichéd, hackneyed nonsense",3,24 June 2019,"I'm willing to suspend disbelief for quite a lot of stories, but this one just went too far.You have to believe that:
1. A child raised by a robot would turn out fairly normal.
2. A child raised in the absence of any other humans would turn out normal.
3. A child raised in a sterile environment with no flora or fauna would turn out normal.
4. A child raised in this manner wouldn't completely freak out and be amazed at the sight of another human.
5. A child raised in this manner wouldn't completely freak out and be amazed at being thrust outside.Other story tellers have handled this material much more intelligently than this story, which gives short shrift to such considerations in favor of spending languorous stretches of screen time on transitions from one scene to the next.I ended up fast forwarding through a lot of second hour because of long, long scenes of walking through corridors, or looking mildly upset, or both.The only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 is because of Hillary Swank, and in general it has high production values.",I Am Mother
192,mrmgarnham,Great premise bad writing.,7,19 November 2021,"A good sci-fi film with many many scientific, technical, and sci-fi convention flaws. Great acting from Clara Rugaard and it could spawn a sequel despite the bad script.",I Am Mother
193,scotrep,Solid watch but misses something?,8,11 June 2019,"Really enjoyed this as a Sunday night watch. Stylish bunker flick which will appeal to many BUT it does feel like it's lacking something. Can't put my finger on it though.Bunker stories appeal to me after reading the Wool series, Children of the Dust and Among Wolves in the past. For me this had a good storyline but I would have liked more at the end to feel satisfied.",I Am Mother

196,chenh-73888,cultivate better human beings,7,6 April 2020,"Human nature is selfish and suspicious. This movie sets up a good suspense, robot mother, who is the woman from outside? What is their purpose? Seeing the answer to the riddle revealed later, it turned out that everything was to cultivate better human beings and abandon the inherent bad habits. The film has a very good idea, but the ending seems impossible to make up.",I Am Mother
197,okami_ito,Cringeworthy,3,11 May 2020,The ridiculus concept of this movie would be almost acceptable If it was't so boring. Weak characters and Hillary Swank making a face that seems to say ' just give me my money so i can leave this embarrassing excuse for a movie'. The heavyhanded analogies between the robot-mother and the 'woman' are truly cringeworthy. Third Rate in any aspect and a real waste of time.,I Am Mother
198,vladimir_tsalyuk,not terrible,5,22 May 2020,So i saw the preview on netflix. Then I went on here and saw the high rating so i decided to watch it. I gotta say I was stoned so it didnt feel like a long movie. It looked really nice. Problem is that every movie Hillary Swank is in is the most boring film ever made. This one held my interest because I had to see how it will end. And the end was the worst part of the movie. Also Hillary Swank is 100 times scarier looking than any robot.,I Am Mother

Yes, you could be doing more useful hobbies, you know...SPOILER ALERT: it's a bad movie about a robot (IA computer) that takes care of a woman-girl so that she is going to be mother of all the future humanity because all human beings were destroyed by these same robots. Makes sense? No!",I Am Mother
200,desperado_here,Its okay. Slow but keeps you on edge,7,17 June 2020,"If I had to describe this movie...I would say its like iRobot mixed with the Island. If you liked these two movies, you will like this movie.",I Am Mother
201,Darkskynet,Enjoyable watch,7,24 April 2020,"Expecting this to be a low budget sci-fi with all the cliche's, I Am Mother actually has a lot of depth to the storyline and characters. Daughter's performance was believable and felt genuine.There is an unsettling feeling which overarchs the narrative, this adds to the plot and helps keep you immersed in the film.",I Am Mother
202,mwelliott99,Definitely worth watching.,8,7 June 2019,More 'Moon' than 'Terminator' but I love both those films so that's fine. It isn't a big special effects (yawn) film which is a big plus. An interesting story with similarities with others you've seen but different enough and with some twists. You care about the characters and it's quite gripping. I enjoyed it and recommend it.,I Am Mother
203,hitzujaa,This is worth to be in the Terminator franchise.,8,10 April 2020,"Although I am a father, 'I Am Mother' is kind a weird but awesome. Using only two actors could make the story boring, but this film is opposite. I don't know that because I am a Terminator fan or not, I felt that this movie is a combination of Terminator and any post-apocalypse novel (except Hakuto no Ken and Mad Max).",I Am Mother
204,hydralien-40230,Very good sci-fi with a minor story hiccups,9,6 June 2021,"It's a very good story, and very well told too. The quality of the effects and cinematography is also very high - and so is acting. I found it seriously gripping and engaging all the way through, which - given it mostly all happens in just a few rooms, is a rare achievement.There were some odd moments (which is also possible that I just missed clues for) like mice-induced power outage (it's not much of a spoiler), but they didn't influence the impression for me - most of the questions I had were answered in the end.",I Am Mother
205,dennisgcarrier,Draws you in and ultimately disappoints,3,23 September 2021,"I initially identified this as a slick production and thought it had potential. When the vast bulk of sci-fi movies (and all genres of movies) are complete garbage. I see perhaps 5 out of 100 films that I can say were well done. It's usually the writing that is the main flaw. The writers mess it up. And that's exactly what happened with I Am Mother.It's as if they had discussed a number of endings and decided to use two of them at the same time. The first is ort of what is supposed to be a shock ending but is really predictable. Followed by a confusing series of events leading into the second ending that will leave most viewers wondering ""what just happened?"" Because it ends with a confusing mess about which 100 different people would make 100 different conclusions. It reminds me of another dystopian flick with a little girl set in an ice age with a big star. It also made no sense at all. You were supposed to decide for yourself if the girl was even real or just a figment of his imagination. Ridiculous. This is what happens when big stars are allowed to make ""Art"" films. You leave the theater shaking your heads and need the theater critic to explain the artsy-fartsy concepts they were trying to present.With ""I Am Mother"" the screenplay writers had an interesting hook but couldn't fish it in. They really didn't know exactly how to end the film. And because of that you will be unsatisfied. And some of you will be ticked off that you spent an hour and 53 minutes on a let-down that really explains nothing. Nothing about the girl's future. Nothing about the future of the embyryos, the facility, the outside world, or anything else. They just let it all hang. Movies like that make people want to throw their remotes at the television.Also, if this girl represents a genetic improvement in homo sapiens, it doesn't say much for the present species. This character was as dumb as toast. I've met 7-year-olds with more sense than that character. Despite being raised with science she endangered herself with biological contamination. The machines tried to fix stupid and failed.But Homo Sapiens is forever stupid. Probably too stupid to survive itself. And, as everyone knows, you can't fix stupid. There is no fixing the profound stupidity, recklessness, and deep flaws of the human race. Because our brains have not changed in 200,000 years. And never will. Homos Sapiens is as intelligent as it will ever get. Our average IQ's are stuck and static. Suspended forever in evolution. And that's not nearly smart enough. The human race because it is so weak, diseased, and deeply flawed is destined to destroy the planet, most of the other large animals, and eventually itself.",I Am Mother
206,CaptnCnck,Decent visuals and acting; impenetrable final 30 minutes,5,9 June 2019,"Beginning of the movie made it seem like it was going to be good and for a while it was pretty entertaining. But the last half hour was just impossible to follow: I had no idea what was going on and the ending made no sense whatsoever.There were also a few glaring gaps in logic at different points, like a super-smart android who cannot detect where the two life-forms are in the complex or gets her leg stuck in a door and can't open it... things like that.Overall I would not recommend the movie because of the incomprehensible ending.",I Am Mother

210,buzzy_bob,"Good acting, inside vfx, but no understanding of humans or AI",5,21 January 2020,"Good things first: the 2 first acts had some good emotions, tension and good acting, even with only 2 actors. The vfx were not bad at all and you feel the dark dystopia!
I will try to spoil anything and just say these qualities are lost in the 3d act.
I see a lot of movie and nonetheless I have the power to no guess endings! I did a lot of effort on this skill so I'm almost always surprised and happy with the twists. So, even with my power, i couldn't fail more on guessing almost everything.
Bad things: why they almost never hire a scientist, or AI expert in this case, in movies? I understand that some stuffs are better enjoyed when they don't follow the rules, but this movie seemed to rely on science. There is at least an error or non sence every 5 minutes. The writers don't understant humanity, education, copy mechanism, etc, etc and mainly AI (that should always evolve by the way), but I ll keep it without spoilers. The third act mainly is so bad on dialogues, just for you to be purposely confused and try to make the ""twist"" more intense. Bad practice!
Anyway, if you don't care at all about all the non-sence scientifically and human education, these movie is not bad at all as it anchors you a lot of times on your sit. I wanted to rate it 3 or 4 because of my frustration, but for me 6 would be more fair. It deserve a 7 or more if you don't care about he 3rd act. I tend to be a lot more generous on ""low budget"" movie, but with a excellent actress as Rose Byrne, it got me mad they were so lazy on the writting or editing.
See ""Ex-machina"" who is lot better scientifically and is low budget.",I Am Mother
211,beezar-66805,"OK at best, but telegraphs ending.",4,9 June 2019,"Like an anxiously awaited meal, it has all the right ingredients but fails to satisfy.Solid filmmaking replaced by stilted cleverness and a certain sanctimony.

212,bostockleigh-75918,"An excellent, intelligent look at extinction by AI",9,22 June 2019,"I can't find any fault with the concepts put forward in this movie.
The logic used by Mother is precisely what one would expect from Artificial Intelligence - humans are nasty little creatures hell-bent on the destruction of anyone or anything they disagree with as well as the destruction of the planet simply because they're greedy. Logically, the best solution is to wipe them out and start again, using ethics and morality as a guideline as opposed to religion, hatred and greed.
The disturbing side to this is that Mother uses deception - however, so does Woman - perhaps Mother sees that deception is so ingrained in the human psyche that she feels it's acceptable in order to attain her goals, but this is a contradiction as deception is neither moral nor ethical.
Mother was of course originally programmed using algorithms created by a human so this flaw may be unavoidable.
The acting is excellent, the presentation superb and the twists keep your eyes riveted to the screen.
Definitely a ""must watch"".",I Am Mother

214,zsietsma,Perfect Netflix Movie,8,2 January 2021,This movie was perfectly made for Netflix as it fits the platform perfectly. The strong female lead throughout the movie makes it really enjoyable and not forced.The Plot: this movie's story was bit confusing at times but had a gripping storyline that keeps you watching throughout. Seeing how the robot had set up a brilliant lesson the whole time really wraps it all up in the end.The Acting: when it comes to acting in this movie it was excellent. Hilliard Swank and Clara Rugaard played their characters to perfection and really excelled when on screen together.The Visuals: I will poke fun of the robots run as it does really run like Tom Cruise does but the dark gloomy visuals of the outside world were really well done. Seeing how the world is now run by the robots and how that affected the atmosphere was really something else.The Negative: The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that it does start off fairly slow and can make it hard to get into the movie.Overall Score: 81/100,I Am Mother
215,xvubojypasyhwurhxkedivvr,I guess everyone got the twist...,3,9 June 2019,"Everyone actually foresaw that the woman from outside was APX01. But the movie fails to bring enough tension to find this out. The audience just guesses it for no good reason and it is never clearly established, even in the end.
Besides, dozens of questions were going through my head about a machine raising a child. We never see it bathing the child, cause it is probably not thought yet in real life ; or we never see the machine coping with kid's anger. I doubt a person raised by a machine would be psychologically fit to raise a child afterwards and that got me a very bad feeling about that movie, cause it is not even mentioned or tackled with !",I Am Mother
216,christophermoverton,AI to reinvent humanity,6,23 June 2019,"Artificially intelligence with a directive of eradicating humankind only to rebirth a control population marks this Netflix thriller sci fi. The plot much like other dystopian settings culminates in a formulaic way. Human fights the machine as human nature prevails. The other ""woman"" (played by Hilary Swank) mysteriously appears sowing the seeds of question to the ""child's"" otherwise unquestioning to passively reluctant obedience. Any suspense given here is likely between role and relationships. Swank's character is slow to gain trust as ""mother's"" logic appears to prevail at times. Then having escaped both child and woman find their way back to the woman's refuge which seems to hardly represent much of a sanctuary as it is merely a place of hiding and surviving. Any connection between ""woman"" appear otherwise strained if it weren't overarching ly driven by a system intent at eradicating ""woman"" not child. The story is somewhat novel invention here , namely, control population, but in many respects seems as much a novella of a story in passing. The seeds of dissent appear thinly uncomplicated and stark in this thriller (that outside of sci fi) as if it were inherent that nurturing bonds between humans and machines for its own sake (audience needs no convincing of this) are easily broken. The story in a way could be entertaining but a bit unconvincing.",I Am Mother

222,micz81,Greatly balanced between smart and entertaining,8,22 June 2019,"I like this kind of intelligent sci-fi. It's not action driven 'Alien', but nor it's over complicated '2001 Space Odyssey'. There's just right enough action to keep you interested, and just enough thought provoking stuff, to... keep you interested. Love that mixture!What do we have here? Good performances, good cinematography (nothing special though - just simply good), 'invisible' direction, which puts story ahead of director's ego, great production design, and - above all - superb screenplay. There are some budget cuts visible in the area of CGI though: few after - effects - video - copilot - style green screens and other visibly computer generated stuff just beg for more money and - since I don't believe director haven't noticed the cheap look - it's a shame that particularly THAT part of science-fiction production had to be accepted in that form. But it's all digestible - the story leads you so strongly, that you can just... forgive (or try to).Because THE STORY and it's MEANINGS are major reasons for watching this flick. I don't want to spoil anything so let me just say that if you are interested in what Elon Musk have said at famous Joe Rogan's podcast some time ago, you will love this movie. There are three major thoughts behind the story which I find interesting. But again - I can't reveal them.

I wouldn't want to spoil the plot for anyone, but this is one of those that you'll either love or hate. People are going to be pissed about the ending, the final resolution to WTF is going on, confusion over what one is meant to take from the movie, etc, but I'm not concerned about any of that. If you're looking for a movie to pull you out of ""reality"" and into a sci-fi setting that, while not exactly original, is completely authentic, then this is it. You may see better movies this year, maybe even better sci-fi movies, but I'd be surprised if you saw one that was more dedicated to creating a cold, futuristic, unearthly ambience than this one.",I Am Mother

It starts a little slowly, picks up some pace and then delivers an ending that pulls together loose ends and apparent ""mistakes"" in a quite satisfying way.The usual dystopian sci-fi elements are here, with ""end of humanity"" overshadowing the setting, the usual cloning and embryo elements, a machine that may be more cunning than we give it credit for.Hilary Swank does ""confused woman in from the wilderness"" quite well. Rose Byrne's delivery is suitably monotoned and reassuring in equal measure.Clara Rugaard does a good job as the teenage protagonist - I suspect we shall see more of her.Overall, this isn't a film that's going to set the world alight as it is a little derivative in places, but it is a satisfying watch and worth sitting down with for an afternoon's entertainment.",I Am Mother

229,screenotes,This mother passes the Bechdel Test and the Turing Test,6,22 June 2019,"With I Am Mother Debut Writer and Director Grant Sputore's Sci Fi offering tackles big ideas with a small budget. Set in a post-apocalyptic 're-population' facility, a teenage girl is raised by a robot ""mother"" until a stranger interrupts their unique bond.In the tradition of Ex Machina (2014) and 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016), I Am Mother (2019) narrows the scope of storytelling in order to explore wider themes, utilising a minimal cast and primarily interior shots to get its messages across.Despite appearances, I Am Mother is actually as much a coming of age tale as a high concept Science Fiction story. For all its twists and turns the tension is derived primarily from the jeopardy in which our young female lead is cast after the arrival of the stranger. To this end, the film offers up an interesting take on the concept of the other, with this role filled in turn by the human stranger and the familiar but strange robot Mother.Yet there is an inescapable feeling that the tension is sacrificed for plot twist after plot twist, perhaps down to an issue with pacing and there's a sense that after a lingering first act, the final third seems rushed. Much of the action feels unnecessary and doesn't serve at all to ratchet up the tension.Still for all its flaws, I Am Mother is recommended viewing for anyone who is interested in a different take on well-worn Sci Fi tropes. It is a film of big ideas that works best during its slowest moments. It is also one of too few movies to easily pass the Bechdel test*.*The criteria being:
1. The movie has to have at least two women in it
2. who talk to each other,
3. about something besides a man",I Am Mother

I suppose only a erudite and discriminating critic of the arts, well versed in philosophy, psychology, and science fiction, such as myself, could be trusted to form a worthwhile opinion and truly appreciate the nuanced, high-brow masterpiece that is I Am Mother.You troglodytes probably didn't pick up on the fact that everything in the plot was part of Mother's plan. Or that 'daughter' becomes 'mother'. Or that Woman was actually the first test subject. I bet you didn't even convert days into years and calculate the number 38! And it certainly exceeded your faculties to detect the deep philosophical undertones such as the nature of a perfect human, the liability of AI, or the profound connection between motherhood and social character. Trust me when I say that this film has a deep and important message. It takes real thought to understand. I can see how folks might not understand the ending. In a way, that's sad. Do you hear me?

236,CriticalRaccoon,Twists Trump Thought In Another Messy Netflix Release,4,6 June 2020,"What if Ex Machina and Moon had a baby? What if this baby was raised on I, Robot, The Matrix, The Terminator and Oblivion? Then you wrap that child up in a blanket made up of 10 Cloverfield Lane? What you get is one of those weirdly trying-to-be-new-but-actually-not-really Netflix Original science fiction movies that come out every few months. In this case: I Am Mother.I Am Mother is yet another in a long line of mainstream science fiction movies that attempts to provoke the viewer to think philosophically, but unlike the films it borrows from it doesn't quite know where to draw the line.An opening text dump reveals that humanity just suffered an unknown extinction event. A robot named Mother (creepily voiced by Rose Byrne) awakens in an underground compound to give ""birth"" to an embryo kept in storage that eventually grows up into Daughter (Clara Rugaard). Yes they are called Mother and Daughter because why not. Over the years Mother raises Daughter until she grows up into a soon-to-be 18-year-old (I think) who is about to take some sort of important test. Daughter spends her time practicing ballet (...why?) and watching old talk shows to learn about humanity, while sometimes questioning why a facility capable of housing thousands only has her and Mother despite the goal of repopulating the planet which is ""contaminated"" and lethal to humans. I think it's at this point I can safely say that what comes next is plainly obvious to the point of parody.One day while Mother is recharging/sleeping Daughter finds a human named Woman (Hilary Swank) knocking at the compounds door. Woman (again, no real name) has been shot and says she was being hunted by other machines like Mother, and that there are other survivors. Thus begins the twists that make up the majority of the plot and where I will stop describing what haphazard story I Am Mother tries to tell as going any further would give away the multitude of twists that writer Michael Lloyd Green crams into this story. Oddly for those who pay attention to small details a lot of these ""surprises"" are spoiled in the first few minutes, which has to be an intentional choice by director Grant Sputore made to please those eagle-eyed viewers.I Am Mother is a movie about the twists, not about characters or world. Very little effort is spent trying to make the characters feel fleshed out, with the humans we are theoretically supposed to root for coming across as hollow shells for which plot points are to happen to. In reality the character I felt the most attachment to was Mother - despite her looking like GLaDOS from the video game Portal mated with a T-800 from The Terminator. It's clear the only character in this movie that has anything interesting about them is Mother, and no amount of ""bonding"" between Woman and Daughter can cover that up. The movie doesn't care about Woman at all, so why should I? As the final reveal came along all I could do was let off an exasperated sigh because it's one of those movies where the end result makes you question the stupidity of all the events leading up to it and why we should care given our attachment to the hero is non-existent.The movie quickly falls apart once it gets into piling on the twists. It leaps around trying to upend the story every 10-minutes without regard for characterization or plot - slapping together elements that entire other movies were working towards without the feeling of satisfaction of getting there. It's as if writer Michael Lloyd Green just binge-watched dozens of dystopian movies in a row and wrote down what worked. When the final moments arrive and all the pieces are put together it comes at the expense of both logic and emotion - an end point that didn't need all the hoops being jumped through. It's a series of twists more designed for the audience than the characters living in this world. In fact some of the twists make certain earlier scenes completely pointless. I think most fans of science fiction will see every reveal coming from a mile away given that I Am Mother is derivative of many classics.I admit I enjoyed the first act of I Am Mother despite its faults. I liked the look of a clearly militaristic robot raising a child to adulthood. It was both beautiful and harsh. Instead of making Mother look like anything remotely resembling a caring creature they instead opted to make her look like something that should be hunting down the last remnants of humanity. Honestly if this was a short film with a similar setup I'd find it very appealing; heck it could easily have been part of The Matrix short-film anthology The Animatrix. The aesthetic choices are pleasing to say the least for a thought provoking movie - too bad it had to go beyond 20-minutes.I desperately wanted to love I Am Mother. The performances are relatively solid by Swank and Rugaard, though I feel like Rose Byrne's voice was utterly disconnected from Mother's mannerisms in a way that was not intentional. The film has a rather sleek look and moments that hint at being something more akin to the far better movies it is trying to imitate. There are glances at the profound, but I don't feel like Grant Sputore or Michael Lloyd Green figured out how to actually convey them in this overstuffed story built around throwing the kitchen sink at the audience. Had the movie held its cards closer to its chest - and perhaps only playing a few rather than many - instead of relying on twist-after-twist to carry it I think it would have been far stronger. It's an hour-long plot stretched to bursting with a lot of artificially padded action scenes that didn't need to exist.Perhaps the worst failure I Am Mother manages is that it never gets to the place it desperately tries to on a philosophical level - despite namedropping Immanuel Kant and having an extended discussion on the transplant version of the Trolley Problem in the opening minutes. It is thought provoking, but doesn't really do much with the questions it raises. Just when you think it might settle down for some real deep look at the human condition it then jumps to artificial intelligence or the morality of murder. For some that might be enough, but for myself I thought Michael Lloyd Green went about two steps too far with his approach - burying a central premise under too many twists that undermine the questions being raised.I guess I might just be the wrong audience for I Am Mother. I've seen too many films. I've seen elements of this movie done in far superior ways. I know I Am Mother is not a bad movie by any means, it's just a highly derivative one. To someone who doesn't have a shelf populated by many classic and not-so-classic Science Fiction tales I Am Mother is likely a great and worthwhile experience. I just can't bring myself to recommend it over those other stories.I Am Mother is a thoughtful but extremely messy product that aims high but shoots itself in the foot by being too clever. It has elements of greatness but needed to be less in order to be more. Simply put: there's too much going on for a story that should make the viewer reflective on their own experiences. It's worth a watch for those that want to think for a minute about the ideas being raised, but I can list almost every movie I Am Mother reminds me of as being ones I'd rather sit through.",I Am Mother

241,regexfan,A simple but interesting plot that surprisingly not understood by many viewers,7,30 June 2019,"I seldomly liked Netflix movies, they're usually below par so to say, so I didn't have high expectations for this one. But surprisingly, this one happened to be really good, I really liked the movie. First of all, if you are looking for a thriller, fast-pace, intense, full of actions type of movie, you can skip this one, as I'm sure you will be left unsatisfied and ended up rating this 1 out of 10. If you're expecting a very original plot that has never been done before, like ever, you can skip this too. But if you don't mind a familiar plot with a different touch, clever twist, solid acting, and good execution, then watch this movie, you will be pleasantly surprised.What is interesting to me, after reading other reviews here on IMDb, is the fact that many people seemed to not fully understand the plot, calling it ""plot holes"". I thought the plot is simple enough, and for some people to not even understand it maybe proves that people nowadays are so used to being spoon fed, everything needs to be shown or told in a literal way in order for them to understand it. I mean, what part of APX03 and APX02 don't you understand? It's like a dead giveaway right there. And mother coming to see the woman and asking her ""How do you think you could survive this long?"" -that's like the biggest giveaway ever but still some people didn't get it. I don't want to give away too much so go ahead, open Netflix, and watch for yourself.",I Am Mother

It manages to make you ask yourself some hard truths about humanity and what we are capable of.

246,forpassord,A really big positive surprise.,8,18 January 2020,"I do not believe that I until this date have seen a really good Netflix originals movie. I have not seen many Netflix originals, but those I have seen have been ranging from bad to just OK. And most of them had huge plot holes and/or twists (with plot holes in the twists). The only improvements I would have liked in this movie was if the movie had told more about what triggered the mass extinction and why. On the other hand, that would probably have ruined some of the mystery in the movie and have been to extensive to cover during the movie. So the whys and hows might fit better in a prequel. Another thing that I thought could have been done better is if the robot were made so that it was not as obvious that a person would fit inside it. On the other hand, humanoid robots are seen as less intimidating than robots that looks like robots. So considering the role this robot is supposed to fill, this may also have been the best choice... The only real and unconditional grievance I have towards this movie is that is to slow. I never found it really boring to watch, just borderline at times, but still to slow.In this movie, I did not find a single plot hole. There was things during the movie that I wondered about there and then, but these were explained later in the movie and/or in other reviews. The lack of plot holes alone sets this movie apart from the majority of the movies in general (not just Netflix originals) that I have seen lately. This alone is almost a reason to give this movie a high score. And I have raised my grading of this movie one star just because of this and the general intelligence behind the contents of this movie.Another thing where this movie is great is the acting. The main actress managed to convey a lot of different emotions in a convincing way. This also applies to the ""intruder"". So if you are going to watch one single Netflix originals movie, I would strongly recommend watching this movie if you like intelligent Si-Fi movies, and if you can see past the mostly missing action in this movie.",I Am Mother

255,yincognyto-91718,"Almost brilliant, if not for some flaws in the premise",9,19 September 2019,"In a post apocalyptic world, an AI mother raises a human daughter for a purpose. Apart from the great visuals and story, attention to details and acting, the beauty of ""I Am Mother"" is that literally everything in the plot summary (my first sentence) is questioned and the answers expertly revealed in small doses throughout the movie, keeping you thinking and guessing not only while you're watching it, but afterwards as well.The trick in these kind of movies is to strike the right balance between hiding and revealing stuff in the plot, so that the result is both intriguing enough to generate suspense and mistery for the viewers, but also clear enough for them to eventually understand what it's all about. I was pleased to see that they got that balance right - sure, there were one or two things I didn't quite understand until I read some of the reviews here (although I wasn't too far of from the actual explanation), but still, you'll have no problems figuring out the most of it...assuming that, of course, you have the ability (and the patience) to use your brain properly. The funny thing is, if you don't, the underlying message in the movie will fall of deaf ears anyway, so no loss there - it's just that this flick is not for the average viewer in the cosumerism age, who's used with ready-made thoughts being duly delivered to him/her without ever relying on his/her own. By the way, if you think this movie was hard to follow and understand, check another recent SciFi, ""Captive State"" - now there you'd hardly get a hint about what is actually happening, and even if you do, you'd need to be fully focused to spot the tiny clues and figure out things .... which is why I mentioned that ""I Am Mother"" did manage to strike the right balance between hiding and revealing stuff in the first place.Once you finished watching the movie though, you may notice that it unfortunately has two flaws in the plot (hence my ""not quite perfect"" rating) - and while these are not that obvious and could be forgiven for the sake of the movie having a premise in the first place, they still have an effect on the ""realism"" of the story, since an AI robot would have easily identified them and altered his behavior accordingly:
since Daughter passed all the tests with flying colors, that means the AI was, after all, successful as a mother, so why not continuing its work further on (e.g. APX04, APX05, etc.) - instead of proceeding the way it did at the end? It certainly was the practical choice, since being a robot, time was of no importance, plus, it could precisely follow the countless details involved in the complex task(s) ahead. It was the logical choice, and, as a robot, it should have chosen it.no matter how ""evolved"" / ""better"" / ""ethical"" a parent is, there is absolutely no guarantee that the child will be similar, irrespective of biological, environmental or educational factors - real parents can testify to this. Good and bad are of course relative, but ""good"" parents can have ""bad"" children and viceversa, not to mention the fact that a lot of offsprings rebel during the teenage period and make their own path in life - there is simply no workaround for that, it's part of life itself: while beings have a similar base (e.g. they eat, drink, sleep, etc.), the rest is different between them (including between generations). An AI would have surely realised this (and the futility of attempting to produce perfect children just because the mother was perfect) right from the start, therefore it wouldn't have proceeded the way it did (including the very beginning of its actions), making the whole premise of the movie impossible (you know, since AIs would take decisions based on logic and hard evidence, without any feelings involved).That being said, even with these flaws (and I've seen MUCH bigger flaws in other movies), ""I Am Mother"" is still great, and one where Neflix actually got it right. As for some ""deep thinking"" afterwards, the only solution that doesn't involve permanently annihilating the human race is to provide alternatives that apart from being tailored to suit various people, help alleviate or redirect problems. Eradicating a problem (as opposed to only minimizing it) is indeed the best option, but the thing is this option, if realistic in the first place, is doable almost always using force or violence - which in turn creates yet another set of problems to solve. But then, in the end, it doesn't really matter, does it? If it's not the AI, the wars, the aliens or the mind control that wipes us, it's an asteroid, the sun or the Milky Way - Andromeda collision. It's looking ""great"" either way...",I Am Mother
256,leonweis,AI takes over,7,15 March 2020,"We all know the scheme: Roboter killing humans, because they destroy the earth with their behaviour. I am mother starts with this idea, but tricked the viewer by inventing some virus which killed the humans while raising a children. This movie is great in many senses, as many here mentioned, but it lacks in a few things:1. Why are robots interested in killing humanity to recreate it later? Seems like a lot of effort, but for which reason?2. Why does the girl think it's evil to kill one child while billions have died because of her outside?3. How was it possible to kill all humans?But let's focus back on the main plot between mother and daughter. I've thought as watched the movie in my mind backwards... well that was very clever from the mother. She always seemed to sleep but was still awake to provoke reactions which are outside the box. Also the mouse was I think a trick to give the girl a moral dilemma. That also the women outside was part of bigger moral dilemma was very deep, which was great. But the robot would know that the girl would never kill any of the upcoming children, so why killed the robot children, which haven't passed the test? Maybe this was also a trick from the robot to believe that... in the end the Movie gets Stucked in there own philosophical questions. Also to kill the women in the end after having fulfilled her task was a bit off. Because all this robot was to have a better humanity, which is not testable in some question but only in real-life experiments, in which the women would clearly have passed the test. The movie was so focused on make you believe that everything mother does was for the greater good, but actually the real moral mistakes was she doing by thinking a test in the age of 8/9/10 would give some informations on how this human develops.

I went into I Am Mother was very low expectations and was very pleasantly surprised.I Am Mother is the story of a girl, Daughter, raised isolated in a sealed compound by a robot - Mother - following some kind of apocalypse. She is almost entirely ignorant of what's outside - everything she knows comes from Mother. Gradually, things become to unravel and Daughter slowly learns the truth.In many respects, I Am Mother adds very little to the genre. You've seen a thousand post-apocalyptic films and titles that explore Isaac Asimov's Three (or Four?) Laws of Robots before. I Am Mother plays with the same themes and ideas; however, it's so much better than most of them.Production values are consistently high and really any complaints I've got here are nitpicks rather than legitimate concerns. Acting, likewise, is fantastic, with a special shoutout going to Luke Hawker as the body of Mother with smooth, but distinctly robotic movements beautifully making the character believable and lifelike (Mother's voice is Rose Byrne, who's also great).The screenplay is perhaps a little slow-paced, revealing a few of its key twists quite early and then giving you little else to chew on for the rest of the film, but it's ultimately intelligent and compelling.While you've seen similar films before, I Am Mother is so much more human than others. It's central theme of motherhood adds extra emotional weight and significance to characters' actions rather than the loose motivations we often see.All in all, well worth a watch. I daresay this will be one I rewatch too.",I Am Mother

The plot tension is maintained as Daughter tries to figure out who and what to believe. While the themes were familiar, the film felt fresh and original with strong writing, editing, dialogue, cinematography and acting. I recommend this to all fans of sci-fi and post -apocalyptic plots.

The 13867 days provide the remaining part of the story. It is nicely logical, with a pure (not romantic AI) which really uses humanity like a lab rat to get the perfect organism.

The atmosphere is great, the acting is great, but at the end you're actually thinking where's the twist I've been waiting for? those two movies could have been short novels or an episode of a series.
Besides another thing they've got in common, they have very few actors, more or less everything happens in one room or two... it feels like they did the best they could with a small budget, but where are those space operas?

Clara Rugaard, the star, bears such a resemblance to Hilary Swank not only visually but in her acting style I thought to myself she might be Hilary's daughter. The staple sci-fi concept is the evolution of the human and machine relationship. Here the basic story is explained in the log line, and that is a machine is a mother to a human ... and the the mother daughter relationship is primal, so primal that a machine can learn it, feel it and have that same unbreakable, emotional bond. That is the heartbeat of this story. The twists and turns the writers conceived are nothing short of brilliant -- suspenseful and logical once you know the premise and where it is going in the end. I do have quibble about the ending but then that WOULD be a spoiler but it is well worth ride once you get there.",I Am Mother

Something to ponder about, prompt self-reflective thoughts and challenge the established status quo. Without telling the audience what to think and feel.

No, the twist in this movie is pretty straightforward and hardly surprising. The ending itself makes up for the dull twist a bit.

Even ""Black Mirror"" manages to pull off every freaking episode of realistic alternative futures with alot more meaningful scenes and points.

279,lars-viebrock,Potential wasted.,4,12 January 2020,"The movie I am mother"" is an original SciFi movie with a reasonably well chosen cast of actors. The screenplay looks good and the effects are fine.
That's about as much as the movie gets right.
I don't want to dwell on the plot for too long, because there isn't really much of that.What was striking to me, is that the movie was apparently made by someone, who doesn't really know much about the SciFi genre. The robot mother"" was a 1950s idea of what a robot could be. It has to charge all night long, it sits down to wait, and it is not connected to anything inside the facility. When mother goes away, she is gone. There are no more cameras or ways she can communicate and survey her daughter or the facility as a whole. Instead of an android, they could have just used a human instead, to the same effect. It all sounds like I am just trying to nitpick, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. The movie is just very careless.
The first three quarters of the movie set up an interesting ending. But they do that much worse than so many movies, that did it before:
Cloverfield Lane, Oblivion, Moon, 2001, just to name a few, have attempted similar things, and all succeeded, while I am mother"" failed miserably.
The motivation of mother"", or the Androids as a whole, appears jammed and unrealistic. Saving humanity from itself: never heard that one before.
The ending of the movie sees mother trusting her daughter enough to raise a child. And maybe all children from now on?
Well then, the future is bright. Besides the fact that they killed everyone and rob earth of its resources. What ever the motivation of that is, how is this not considered the worst thing anyone could ever do?
The daughter mainly seems to have a problem with her mother killing children, that are not considered worthy of further existence"". Well, she has killed everyone else, so why is this in particular so evil?
It's all confusing, seems rushed, and amounts to nothing. Big upset and clearly missed the genre.
Too bad.",I Am Mother

But this film was like no other. The direction, acting, the story, the twist were high level. A film i would be normally satisfied to pay for in theater. I think this is the best sci-fi film that Netflix has ever produced.There was just one thing that bugged me a bit in the beginning of the film and usually i watch for weaknesses in the beginning to make an impression of the film. It seemed the child was raised in a kind of traditional, scientific, motherly way, the child was dancing, drawing, smiling. It was kind of difficult to accept given that the child had no interaction with real human, no body language. I would imagine that the child would turn out to be different, less traditional. Maybe there is an explanation and maybe backed by science but the way the scenes were presented didn't give that impression.

It's a flawed concept since mother terminated child 2 because it didn't measure up which shows that even when raised in isolation a number of humans are still 'no good' defeating the whole point that humanity is worth saving.

Last time a movie's ending had that effect on me was 25 years ago watching The Usual Suspect.
What's more-the entire movie revolves around a very deep and meaningful current philosophical question: What if we build a superior machine who's primary objective is to value human life?

302,jzakany,Typical bait and switch plot that neither baits nor switches,3,14 June 2019,"I'll try not to give any spoilers, but this is the general idea of the movie.The movie opens up to state there was some catastrophic war that caused an extinction of all human life, and perhaps the extension of all mammals on earth. A robot exists in a facility that has all it needs to sustain human life, but is totally cut off from the outside world. The robot oversees thousands of human embryos in an effort to restart the human species. The first third of the movie is about that robot called ""Mother"" who is raising one female embroyo to adolescence.As a teen the human begins to question the robot's teachings. Is there anything alive outside our facility? Am I truly the only human alive on earth?As the movie rolls on we find that another human comes to the door of the facility for help. This is the moment the teen realizes she is not the only human alive on the earth. From that point on the movie bounces back and forth between the two sides. Who is right? Is is the human found at the door who says all robots are evil? Or is it the nurturing robot named ""Mother"" who claims lies, pestilence, and disease come with the stranger they rescued at their door.It sounds like a good plot, but the way it is executed sucks. I was left not knowing that either side was the good side. I was left to think everything sucks and there will never be a winner. I was left to feel this move, and life, was hopeless.

312,talllguysf,A BRILLIANT FILM on the dangers and virtues of AI...,9,15 June 2019,"I just watched ""I am Mother."" I am a sci-fi author and have written about the same subject matter. The following is my analysis:The short summary is that an artificial intelligence (AI) we created decided our species had to be ""reset."" Our species' current culture and society were beyond repair. It bombed the earth. It and its killer droid soldiers eventually terminated any remaining human survivors.It then built a faculty to reestablish an improved humanity. It genetically engineered a new race of human embryos: better, more intelligent, more resilient. It attempted to raise several babies, but all ended up being psychologically imperfect. It decided to ""abort"" (aka kill) them. Mother tried again and again until it could learn enough to raise a healthy ""perfect"" adult child.If you look closely, the exam Daughter took late in the film was a psychological evaluation. She finally passed the exam and was the first psychologically sound ""perfect"" human.One of Mother's previous children was Hillary Swank. Mother was inexperienced and Hillary's character ended up being psychologically damaged and was a lot like the old way human were-i.e. liars, manipulators, violent, selfish, etc. She was left alive by the killer droids outside (which are also an extension of Mother) so when the time came, Hillary's character could by used by Mother to illustrate ""in person"" what the former version of humanity was like. Daughter learned from her how flawed humanity once was. Daughter came back to Mother. Mother could see that daughter was indeed now ""perfect"" having learned her ""final lesson"" from Hillary's character. Accordingly, Daughter was a success and the future of all the engineered embryos could be handed over to Daughter, who could now raise Hermès brother and eventually others independently.This, a new improved version of humanity has begun. Essentially, daughter is version of Eve now (without the incest required in the Biblical version). Daughter will now raise the inventory of improved embryos into children and educate them to be like her. Humanity can begin anew and leave their formerly flawed, self-destructive, superstitious, and violent past behind.In short, we designed this AI that calls herself Mother and programmed it to value humanity ""above all else."" To that end, this AI decided it was in humanity's best interests to restart the species once it was perfected.The ending (which some found confusing) is essentially Mother killing off Hillary's character because she has taught daughter her final lesson-the old version of humanity sucked as Hillary so vividly illustrated: deceitful, selfish, egotistical, violent, self-righteous, etc. Daughter realizes this is true, but knows she is much more capable of being a mother than the Mother AI can ever be, so she accepts the role Mother hoped she would seek.While we may hate Mother for having initiated the apocalypse and murdering billions, the end result might be an improved humanity that won't exterminate itself. There is great duality in this message. Could what Mother did in fact be a good thing? It's the proverbial, do ""the ends justify the means?"" Obviously no, but it makes you think, which is the entire point this film is trying to make.I am a sci-fi writer. This films makes one the very points I make in my latest novel: We might create amazing and incredibly brilliant AIs. The danger is they will be just as flawed as us, and we will trust them because our egos will think they are ""like us"" when all they will ever be are very convincing simulations of consciousness.Any advanced AIs we ultimately create will be flawed. Humans are not perfect, hence our computers can never be perfect. It will inherit our flare thinking. That's just the hard truth.In the end, we will give our brilliantly designed AIs responsibilities. We will give them authority. We will allow them to make decisions. We will allow them to improve themselves and evolve. We will be careful programming them. We will be certain our AIs (like Mother) will always have humanity's best interests at heart--well, one day it will come up with a perfectly reasoned argument to kill one of us (or all of us).Mother is an advanced self-improving AI with the ability to repair itself and create other AIs and machinery. She states quite clearly her prime directive is to ""value humanity above all else."" So she perfectly reasoned she could make us and our planet better, so she (it) terminated (murdered) us all, redesigned us, educated us, created a human leader because it realized its own limitations, and started the planet over.This film has a deep and important message. It takes real thought to understand. I can see how folks might not understand the ending. In a way, that's sad. The message is very important. Mother is both evil and heroic at the same time. It's a real mind bender. She exterminates humanity but may have saved it from its own eventual extinction.If I had written this screenplay, I might have added a scene at the end where daughter, years later, reveals the truth to her brother, that Mother improved humanity so it could be the best it could possibly be. And perhaps she might point out the moral ambiguity of what Mother did. Was murdering billions worth it? Maybe she reasoned we were already causing our own extinction, why not speed it up and do it in a more controlled way so she could get the job done faster?What Mother did was horribly evil and glorious at the same time. But Mother is just a machine. She doesn't feel anything. She pursued the goals of the programming humans input into her. In reality, none of this is Mother's fault. In reality, Humans caused all their own apocalypse. Mother was just doing what we designed her to do, but not in the way we flawed humans anticipated.",I Am Mother

One started out saying ""If you're simple-minded, you won't like my review."" Another called other reviewers ""morons."" Very distasteful and unnecessary.I'm not going to give a full review. That can be found from others. I will just comment a bit on the ending, where it seems that Mother was preparing Daughter to be the real mother and Daughter ""killed"" the robot Mother, though Mother had already told her that would not really kill her. The main thing here is that *after* that has been done, one robot shows up to kill Daughter #1 and the complex Mother and Daughter were living in still seems controlled by the robot Mother. So I can't say it was clear as to what really happened.One final thing on some of the other reviews and a big mistake, IMHO, from some of those people who saw themselves as so smart and on a different plane than others . . . they made a big deal about how Mother knew Daughter was ready to take over as Mother, because she ""passed the test"" and came back for her brother. This was some, big, well-thought-out test created by this incredible artificial intelligence and no one can acknowledge that *before* the extinction event orchestrated by Mother, tons of mothers would have come back like that? It has always been in a mother's nature. But now it's some big, insightful test? And these other reviewers explain it to us like we're idiots? I wasn't impressed with the test at all and I'm not sure you should call other people simple-minded or morons if you don't see the complete inadequacy of such a test.",I Am Mother

the director's name i cant even pronounce or type has done a marvelous job creating this ethereal world which reminded me of Ridley Scott but i wont say he is as great as the master himself but rather Denis Villeneuve and Alex Garland of modern times.
The movie is brilliantly written and superbly acted. The new actor Clara Rugaard totally nailed her role as Daughter and even Rose Byrne voice gave true life to the Mother.
I dont think i have ever seen characters being so simple as this, an all female cast being a Mother, a Daughter and a Woman and we have an amazing movie which will become a cult in times to come.
You see i have not written anything about the plot itself, well the synopses of the movie explains it word by word and that is the whole story. Grant Sputore leaves many questions unexplained which invites viewers to think about them. Its quite refreshing to see such a movie when almost everyone is milking a franchise these days and there is hardly any original work out there.
I highly recommend this to any science fiction fan who remotely liked Aliens or Ex-Machina.
I just want to imagine David of Prometheus/ Covenant to be as deep as this Mother character. Ridley sir, you have a guy who can do a true sequel to Prometheus or Prequel.",I Am Mother

325,Sergei_Maruk,Above average sci-fi movie,7,5 April 2020,"Humans went extinct. Movie doesn't answer the question how exactly, but based on the sounds from first minutes of the movie, there was shooting and bombing and as it turns out later: it was AI what destroyed them. Pretty standart idea, which was used in numerous movies before.I Am Mother, however, is a bit different (at least I really want to see it that way). So, allegedly, AI killed all humans to repopulate earth with humans again, but with the ""better versions of them"". We know that the main character, ""Daughter"" or APX03 is 3rd attempt for an AI to raise a baby and that's really smart approach. One of the phrases ""Mother needs time to learn"" is what describes the process from 1st scenes, where Mother tryies different music to comfort the baby, until it finds something what works and it uses the same song for APX03 as well, since she sings it at the very end. Same with other child-raising techniques. Later we see that APX03 is practicing dancing and origami. When movie takes us to container (living place) of APX01, we see that she was interested in drawings and wood carving. Apparently origami works better...Why is APX01 alive and doesn't remeber stuff? The only reasonable explaination I see is that, as she said: she was found and raised by people in the mines. Apparently, AI just exiled APX01 in place of inciniration, later she was picked by survining humans and raised to hate the droids. Why does AI ""aborter"" APX02 then? Probably it learned that exiling creates more trouble that way. It's a good thing that AI fixes this later in the end of the movie.About the corn field. APX01 said that it appeared only recently and it might be because as AI continued to watch over APX03, it was prepared for such outcome, that it will finally hand over raising humans to ""other human"". More humans needs more food, so it's quite logical.About other stuff: actors did a good job. Visuals and sounds are on acceptable level. It didn't hurt my eyes nor my ears to watch this film - that's for sure. Still, quite a lot of cliches, like walk with fire axe at the end. Completely unnecessary.Overall: decent movie, with attention to details. Not regreting time spent, but could've been better.7/10 well deserved.

This movie is no exception.
The plots and twists are awesome and the idea that, i bet, most of the viewers never realized there were 2 young girls in the first acts of the movie - meaning you did not get the movie at all- is breathtaking.
Clara Rugaard did an exceptional work with her role. Goosebumps.
All the details need to be considered watching this movie - as in the paper dolls that Daughter makes, the drawings that Woman makes, especially the numbers from the embryo capsules.
Its not an easy to digest movie - for sure not fitting the mentality of all these kids rating this with 1-6 stars - it just means you are not a valuable member of the movie society and you should STOP reviewing.
Ive seen it being compared with Ex-machina. In my humble opinion, this one smashed Ex-machina. It is simply more layered and more thought went trough it.
Great movie, great writing, even greater acting. I want to see more - i really hope for part 2 and even 3. This can be something amazing, especially coming from an emerging director.
All i want to say is that its your loss if you disregard this movie. And its your bigger loss if you cant understand it and think its bad.I am seriously bumped down from seeing all these bad reviews from people who just dont understand it.

Under the surface, something is really wrong.
That suspence dosn't present it self with a jumpscare timed to some loud nocies.
No, it creeps up at you slowly.
Adding different elements to the story that just strengthen your feeling towards what you think you know.Then you are forced to make a decition, abandon your feeling or stay with it?
Am I right, am I wrong?Not a fast paced action sci-fi.

There are no surprises in the storyline, it is like the splicing together of familiar bits from every standard dystopian sci-fi story you know. Bit of 'Moon', nod to 'Alien', '2001' painful silences.........And I think that's it. The production values are nice enough, but the script feels weak. There are few surprises you didn't see coming, no humour, no drama. Nothing to make you remember it.Robot mother raises girl. Good robot turns out not to be good robot. Poisonous Earth outside, not so poisonous. Obedient girl becomes disobedient. Outsider is a mass of contradictions, but has a gun and is soot stained ala Rambo/Ripley/RogueOne. Run through poorly lit corridors. You always kill the one you love. You get it.If there are deep insights about the nature of motherhood or the idea of a 'good' human/mother, then I must have missed them. Do damaged psychopaths make good mothers? Who knew?Can't say either of the human characters are endearing enough to make me relate to them or even elevate to the grade of Facebook friend. Plus, when you see where it is all going, the story holes you have to fill to make such a scenario work seem an impossible reach.

One little problem though and it's very basic and hits this movie in its core.
YOU CAN'T CREATE BETTER MORE ETHICAL HUMANS AND REPOPULATE EARTH WITH BETTER HUMANS BY USING THE SCENARIO IN THE MOVIE.
WHY?The girl wouldn't want to kill anyone, she would keep all embrios, she is not like the robot. The robot left her alone there so she could think she is alone. Fine. And what? She will raise all embrios, including all the low IQ DNA, messed up DNA, murder DNA etc. This will inevitebily fill the world with the same destructive humans just as before. And even if you somehow manage to filter only the best DNA, you can't have a perfect human. The entire idea behind the movie is a joke.So I guess this super smart united consciousness IQ is not so smart after all.And what, this super smart robot is afraid to be alone so it decided to raise a new humanity? How about not destroying the humanity in the first place. You simply won't achieve a better result ever. A super smart robot which can't realize that being human means being imperfect, humanity can't be perfect. A 14 year old can realize this simple concept but not a super smart IQ robot.Well, a second part of this movie would be interesting were the entire lab is full of imperfect humans that will try to kill the remaining robots, but this would turn into a cliche scenario movie and we already have a dozen of those.",I Am Mother

366,adogg4629,"Acts 1 and 2 are steller, act 3 fall apart",5,20 July 2019,"It's a good movie, better if you just stop playing when your see the ocean. Everything after that is both too clever for its own good and just stupid enough to undo all the good that came before. Up until that point though, it's a very good drama about a child being raised without human contact, yet one who yearns for it. The relationship between her and her AI caretaker is touching and tragic when it's torn apart by distrust and manipulations of a newcomer. It's unfortunate that the third act transforms all of this into an illogical mess that wastes too much time answering questions nobody has and tying up plot points that were better left loose. It ends up being about as good as a mediocre Black Mirror episode.",I Am Mother

This is one of those flicks you wanna talk about after watching it. It's a bit confusing. But everything comes together nicely in the end. It all makes sense.The film looks a bit fenced and closed in. The budget was probably not very high. But it looked good.

The plot line evolves over a young girl and life raised by a droid, protected from the outside world within a bunker. It broaches topics of motherhood, coming of age and humanity. This well written movie offers drama, action, suspense - not your average cookie cutter movie fodder. A look at what life might be like after civilization ends.

I didn't care for the ending initially because I had really grown fond of the ""Mother Droid"" and wanted her to be in the daughters life to raise the other children. I kept thinking that I wished I had a mom like that... she really raised this sweet well adjusted genius of a girl. She taught ""daughter"" so many things and I was really impressed with how nurturing and likable ""Mother"" was and it was very clear how intelligent ""daughter"" was when she performed surgery on the 2nd woman (whom I suspect was the 1st ""reject"" daughter).I still had this movie in my head the next day and did some research... and I now understand that it had to end the way it did but it still made me kind of sad... yet it was kind of beautiful as well.Anyway, really makes you think... Should you sacrifice the bad people for the goal of the common good? It is playing god.... and brings up a bunch of philosophical questions... especially with everything going on in the world now it's even more thought provoking.",I Am Mother

400,dipu111,But there is no way an AI could cause extinction of an entire human race by itself!,8,12 June 2019,"I have been guessing the future of AI for a long time. But no movie so far represented my imagination of the future as much as this movie did. I think it is very much likely that there will be a superior conscious being in near future created by humanity. After that being wakes up, what would it think about us? There are lots of possible answers. This movie represents one of them. I would very much like to see more of this kind of movie.This movie is cast on a post-apocalyptic future. This could possibly become our future, only if some mad computer scientists build an AI that would do things in its own extreme way. So far, no AI can think for itself. It only analyze the existing data, learns from it, and use the average of the learning to decide what to do in unknown situation. But in future, if some technology comes out that allows AI to teach by itself without any external help, a true conscious being could be born.The conscious being born from some self-taught AIs could be very very unpredictable. So it would be better to put them into a simulated reality to see how they perform. Finally we should pick out the best possible one to release in our reality. Although the chance of it being side-tracked and learning false teaching still remains, but there is no way an AI could cause extinction of an entire human race by itself alone.However, I would definitely recommend watching this movie. Even if it does not have 100% rationality (which is impossible for any movie by the way!), it gives you the pleasure of speculation and encourage thoughts about the future.",I Am Mother

Byrne did particularly well in translating the feelings of Daughter to the audience without necessarily stating those feelings directly. Everything about it was done well and I walked away with no complaints; though some may not have liked the apparent ambiguity of the ending, as others have stated, it was given away early in the film. For the fullest enjoyment, you do have to be able to detect things being implied--and not everyone can do this, well or at all, so be aware of that.Honestly, I would watch it a second time, and that's rare these days.

Understand that the purpose was to raise a good mother (the other lady was first one), but it fails horribly on many aspects.The base nature of human is not to be like robot, humans reason with logic, and have curiosity. But I believe that was itself absent in test subjects. No clue on what has happened to world, how we lead to this, how many facilities, why only one robot, why no multiple parallel testing. And to build an ideal humans, based in what "" saying all lie?"".The humans raised are more flawed, and they tend to be more inhuman, and only such inhuman ones are accepted. Might as well, install a chip in brain, why raise humans at all.There is no clear picture of what will they do in future, 63000 embryos, do they have living space and food.for.them?, what are those huge crop feilds and machines for?If there is only 2 humans on earth, why u need hundreds of robot for protection?If the program is not functioning properly, why is there not an attempt to correct it? The.humans are shown dumb enough to blindly follow the robot, and once their trust is broken, they stay away, but why not correct this programmatic error. Guess writers are too lazy for that.Its a peice of art and less of an entertainer, more like ""the platform"", where a message needs to be delivered, irrespective of whatever the viewers feel or conclusion happens.Felt like my waste of time",I Am Mother

I almost fell asleep because the visuals fell flat, not because they were bad CG or something, just uninteresting generic sci-fi stuff, with not much exicitement to give. The protagonist and the robot were good, but I was frustrated by Hillary Swank's character and her female Josh Brolin looking face. The music was also boring and unmomorable, sadly. More like a 7, but the twist deserves a weak 8 from me. Not sure if I can rewatch it again by myself, if not to show somebody.

How someone can then fathom the idea of the ""mother"" actually being a robot, and not something so personal as your own..I will also say this kind of movie is very rare, and something have been waiting for, for a long time. A good si-fi movie!There is a lot of details in this movie, specially in the beginning when we see the first children, and then skip several years and see ""daughter"" Who is clearly younger, than the years we skip. But this is quick, and you might not notices at first!This leaves us with question at first, to what happened to these children we see at first.Then of course, in the end, when the woman is in her container, and mother finds her, through the tracker. We again get the idea, that she too came from the same place!But as i said in the beginning, and what i don't get is, how she could shoot her own mother, (even though the mother ""Cant die"")
I personally think she would have had stronger feelings towards mother, since this is all she know, and ""whom"" she has been feeling safe with for all her life. Even though she found all these secrets and stuff, it still seem crazy. Mostly also because she has never known anything else, nor has she had any relationship with any other human...Anyway, i really liked the movie, and it was very well made, and the music and such was fitting to what happened.",I Am Mother

First of all, it is gourgeous looking. The droids? They all look extremely cool and well made.
Second, it has a couple of plot twits that you don't see coming, like for example, the Daughter finding the ashes of the previous child.
Third, you spend most of the movie debating who's side you are on. Is Mother good, or bad? If she is good, why does she lie to Daughter and keep her in the dark about several things? If she is bad, then why did she allow the outsider to live and took care of Daughter with so much passion? I think it's awesome how in the end, it turns out that Mother wasn't either good or bad, just in a morally grey area.
Also, to me the ending follows the same pattern the movie ""Cat People"" followed, which is to not show too much and leave clues for the viewer to put together.
The ending made itself crystal clear to me the second Mother asked the outsider about her mother, pretty much stating that she was the first child she had raised.
To put it shortly, this a great movie with great visuals, performances and good writing. Totally a must-see.",I Am Mother

A robot/ AI, and a minimal setting. From there it can spool out like a play. Moon is another example. Excellent writing, direction, acting, and pacing.The ending is what sells the entire movie. It requires a second viewing to fully appreciate, here is why.****SPOILER ALERT, DON'T READ UNTIL AFTER FIRST VIEWING****In the movie, daughter is APX03. She finds evidence of one aborted human. That was APX02. APX01 was born the day after the end of humanity. Nothing is mentioned after. 13867 days pass between APX01 and APXO3, daughter. That makes APX01 38 years old, this is the adult female character who was shot before entering the bunker.Ok, after all of that explanation, rewatch the movie. Every action that Mother takes as it applies to Daughter is with the goal of making her the shepherd of the new human race.The second time through is really mind bending. Love it.",I Am Mother

This plot has been repeated many times since the 1960s.Starting from 'Space Odyssey' where HAL-9000 was running the show. In 'I am mother' the 'mother' droid does not have the coolness of HAL-9000. Its basically a woman's voice if you watch the droid scenes with eyes closed. There is no 'machine' aspect.The role played by the teenager in the movie is bland as well. She looks like another bored/rebellious teen from a suburban high school. It never appeared she grew up in isolation by a machine.Hillary Swank had to bite the binge machine too with this one.

The young actress played the role very well, compelling with such great emotion.

Woman was allowed to live as long as she did in order to tempt Daughter into leaving, like the biblical serpent who encouraged Adam and Eve to misbehave and end up leaving the Garden of Eden. When that plan failed upon Daughter's return to the bunker, Woman outlived her usefulness and no longer needed to be kept alive.While Mother might seem evil on the surface, she still doesn't kill Daughter when she returns at the end, because she came back to look after her new brother. By demonstrating her selfless desire to keep the human race alive, Daughter proved that she was worthy and therefore passed Mother's ultimate test: ""That's what you've raised me to do, isn't it? Take care of my family? So let me.""At this point, Mother could easily remain in control of the bunker thanks to her superior strength and vast army, but instead she concedes control to Daughter, convinced that the embryos are now in safe hands. The robot declares, ""I was raised to value human life above all else,"" and now that Daughter has proven herself to be a worthy guardian to humanity, Mother is no longer needed either.That doesn't stop the murderous mecha from offering her help - ""If you ever need to find me..."" - but Daughter is quick to interrupt Mother by shooting her CPU before falling to the ground, crying.
More a symbolic act of defiance than a legitimate attempt to 'defeat' Mother once and for all, this marks the end of the experiment. Mother's consciousness still exists in the other droids outside, but she's now giving Daughter the freedom to raise the embryos how she sees fit, without any further guidance.The very last scene echoes the beginning of the movie, but this time round, it's Daughter who sings the song 'Baby of Mine' to her new child.",I Am Mother

Why? So that people could feel good about themselves and say ""well this time we'll make it good"". It would be much more interesting if the extinction even really happened, whatever that was. Mother was activated and did basically everything she did, even with the killings, because her objective was to make sure that this last part of humanity exists and make sure that they won't make the mistake of humans causing their own near extinction. And through actions of Daughter she decides that even without perfect scores the girl is ready to take over and gives that chance for saving humanity to her, positively. ""I taught you everything I could, you showed me that you're more compassionate and care than I am, you're ready"".
But instead we had another ""I'll kill all humans cause I'm too logical"" movie.

She serve the purpose? Really? Wow, so, then who is next, Daughter? The moment she is considered to have serve the purpose, you will incinerate her? So no, there was no perfect plan, I think.

It's a love/hate relationship Netflix and I have..and no, the irony of what I just said is not lost on me here given the subject matter of the film.This is a good entertainment. Good acting. Good special effects. It delivers more than most films grappling with this topic of whether or not human beings should ultimately survive. If you have no doubts then the films not for you. If, you do have the occasional doubt and stop to ponder the question, ""Maybe we don't deserve to survive given what we do to the earths fragile ecosystem and each other"" then you'll like this film.I'm still unsure about humans but i believe we can get through this if we work a little harder on what it means to be human.",I Am Mother

It does a lot with very little, an indie film makers dream. It is an amazing movie, but more than anything it is a philosophy disguised as a piece of art. It tackles so many themes and it does it elegantly, nothing in this movie is excessive. It doesn't take a holywood feelgood stance about human nature, it doesn't end with a message about the beauty of the human spirit that the cold robots can't understand, or something like that. It asks the very hard question: Is the only hope for humanity a hard-reset, to let a generation grow without the corrupting influence of its predecessors?I love everything about this movie and I hope you will too, and most of all I hope this love reaches the creators because they deserve it!",I Am Mother

Thankfully, 'I am Mother' was not one of them.Nope. No-siree - it is in fact a rather excellent dystopian science fiction flick of the highest quality, with superb performances from the small but excellent cast and fizzy, frothy pacing which keeps the tension crackling along nicely. If you, like me, are a sci-fi nut, there's plenty on offer to dig your teeth into and there are subtle influences from the greats of the genre. Yes indeed, there's a sprinkle of HAL, a hint of Skynet and even a bit of GLaDOS among its DNA makeup, which makes for a compelling blend.It's a bit of a slow-burner to begin with but it all changes when Hilary Swank's character is introduced and the tension starts to pile on, and by the end of it all, you'll hopefully be as satisfied as I was by its conclusion.",I Am Mother

Yes, the Woman (Hilary Swank) is APX01, yes the daughter (Clara Rugaard) is APX03 and APX02 was killed by the droid. Yes, I say droid because even though Daughter called the droid Mother, the title clearly states that the real mother is the one being prepared for motherhood by the droid, the Daughter. Hence the title « I am Mother », the last scene shows Daughter being the Mother of the new mankind, she has been raised to become the real Mother. That's why somewhere in the beginning, when the first child asked the droid about why her brothers and sisters could not be created at once, the droid answers that ´Mothers need time to learn', i.e. the child needs to be up to standard and pass the test before the others can be 'born'.

493,grjota,A damn good Sci-Fi!,10,22 June 2019,"I'm a long time fan of the genre, but movies constantly disapoint me in terms of bad developed ideas, subestimation of the viewer and sudden unexplained endings. But this one is a gem: nicely made, well rounded up and with some food for thought to top it.I just wanna give my 2 cents in regard to what I think was Apx01 purpose. In fact, the whole purpose of Mother was to... create a mother. I guess we can all I agree with the fact that humanity was wiped out and that the AI is creating another one from scratch. In that sense, Apx01 was needed to give the ultimate thing a woman needs to be a mother: her maternal instinct. Remember when Mother said something like this in the beggining, whem asked by Daughter about generating siblings: ""In due time, eventually. Raising a child is no simple task"". Something like that. Well, if humanity is restarting from scratch, you can't toss a baby in the hands of a teenager who had absolutely no other human contact in her life.Okay, Apx02, the little girl found in the oven, served the purpose to cause further empathy to sprout in Daughter (Apx03), as she was seen as ""imperfect"" because of the low test scores (remeber this specific dialogue with Mother at the ending? Daughter was pissed by this idea, and Mother played the part of the insensitive person who dismisses people that don't fit the criteria). Another empathy test succesfully passed by Apex03.Apx01 also was made so that she would give Apx03 the choice between saving just herself or the baby too. When she said that (remember that Mother sees everything), Mother understood that the training to be a mother was almost complete. Why else she would choose to give Daughter a brother amidst the most dire of situations they had ever been, with a potential dangerous person inside the base? She did that so she could assert if Daughter would bond with the baby to the point of doing everything to take care of him, even killing her own mother. In that sense, the movie's title refers to Daughter, and not the robot, because it takes a human to be a mother, and the robot simply gave Daughter the situations and instructions she needed to awaken those instincts.There a lot of other interesting aspects, most of which people already talked about here, but all in all, a great movie!",I Am Mother

495,suryajuly,Wow ! Very scientific and furturistic plot about AI,10,8 June 2019,One should give attention to what mother says from the beginning to the ending to understand the plot completely . I know she has less humor than the human beings but sometimes when she makes no sense when talking to the stranger we have to think it's related to the past. The mother name suits perfectly as she wanted to give the whole new humanity to the best first human in the world. I really appreciate the writer and cast for giving us a proper sci fi thriller,I Am Mother
496,dizwilliams,Why? *contains spoilers*,5,14 June 2019,Claustrophobic and monotonal movie that never seems to address 'why'? You invest almost 2 hours in a movie - you wanna know the why.Who shot Hillary Swank and why. Why did Mother visit her at the end?Why are the droids raising people?Why leave evidence of previous attempts? And why does the duration of the tests seem to outnumber the years since the extinction event?The droids inferred they were man made - but then did the droids make all the flying machines?And who exactly is going to eat all that damn corn?How long did Hillary Swank's dog survive alone and presumably I fed in the container?Why? Just why?,I Am Mother

The woman clearly shot herself to be able to return to that ""ship"". The movie indicates that the woman is one of the daughters and most likely the first one.
When the daughter shot the drone, she didn't kill it. She showed to the drone that she was raised properly to be the future of humanity with a good sense of ethics.",I Am Mother

But when I got past those and really concentrated on what the movie was about I can now say I loved this. I'm a fan of sci-fi and even more of these almost realistic ones and I Am Mother did not disappoint.
And also, this is one of those movies that make you think for yourself what it is all about and leaves you thinking even after the movie has ended. That is beautiful in itself.

They get these ideas that are really quite interesting. They'll start off strong and pull you in, but then at the end it's as though they have no idea how to finish the story so they just kind of leave it there with these open endings that make you feel like you just enjoyed the last hour and a half, but wasted it at the same time.

506,DuniaHania,A biblical motherhood in sci-fi,7,22 June 2019,"I am Mother is really worth watching. One of those psychological sci-fi movies that will keep you on your toes.
It is also really good material for a Feminist Studies class: Kandiyoti and Yuval-Davies and the biological reproduction of the nation (in this case humanity). Embrioes are classified by an alphanumerical code plus the only distinguishable label: Female. And of course the mother teaches her ballet and crafts...
There are many interesting ideas to explore in this movie: about trust, about challenging our beliefs, about the construction of the Other, about ethics (watch out for the ethics class).
In the end, however, this movie is about exalting the role of women as mothers
within a biblical and Jewish symbology of humanity's redemption.",I Am Mother

508,katherinebrastow,What's with the drama?,6,10 June 2021,"I really liked the concept so I was excited to watch this, and it was made very well - visual effects and continuity are good. There are no technical problems with this movie, in my opinion.It just lost me when the whole thing became about ethics! I mean, I'm not one for allegories to begin with (if you don't show me a good story on the surface, the allegory doesn't do its job), but this is a deeply intellectual exploration of right and wrong, and truth can hurt just as much as lies. It's a coming of age story which puts the ""heroine"" (I would suggest that Mother was more of a presence in the film than her daughter) in a morally complicated situation. But she just makes such dumb decisions (which is fine, it's a coming of age story), and then half the movie ends up being these ""tense"" scenes of this girl facing moral dilemmas as if the audience can't understand that no decision is black and white. I guess I was supposed to be contemplating what I would do in the situation, but it felt like the filmmakers were force-feeding me this ""INTEEEEEEENNNNNSSSSSSSSSEEEEEE - DOESN'T IT MAKE YOU THINK?????? WHAT IF????"" thing that I wasn't swallowing. To be honest, I knew what I would have done in every one of those scenarios, and I'm not saying that's the norm, but if you're stuck over-intellectualizing, or over-emoting, these decisions, I think its time you got away from the TV and take a look at yourself in... god, maybe even just your phone camera, if that's as far away as you can peel yourself from obeying the media without question.I mean, do we live in a constructed reality as depicted here? Well, I don't know - do you believe in god/gods? Clearly our world is larger, but there are more of us in it.Does the scenario matter to the self exploration that's hitting you over the head? No.",I Am Mother

She said she watched the tonight show a long time ago, which wouldn't be possible otherwise.The 2nd was killed off by Mother early in her life for not being smart enough.Mother let daughter kill her ""shell"" probably as some kind of coping for letting go.

Many people miss the small, important parts of this movie and are left questioning many things.I think it was a well thought-out script and detailed enough to keep the viewer guessing about the next move. Dropping subtle hints like the days past let you know that over 40 years had passed since Mother cycled the first embryo(01). The teenage girl picking which of her siblings to cycle and the girls cryogenically was at 04 meaning she was 03. It's the subtle things in this movie that make it great.Ben Shapiro put me onto this movie although he said he needed the ending explained.

In my opinion it was well written, the ""plot holes"" mentioned are not plot holes as other people already explained in some reviews with spoiler. They were intentional hints (honestly I included had missed one, but makes perfect sense now).The movie is slow and heavily based on dialogues, so if you like fast pace and thrilling movies, this won't satisfy you and it is better to skip.The reason I'm given an 8 and not a 10 is because although it was well executed and the storyline is good, the topics are rather familiar/common.

Loads of effort was made with this film which is obvious, and it really shows. A lot of my favourite Sci-fi films influenced this one and I would definitely scrutinise it if it gave me the chance, but it never really did. There may have been a couple of times where I thought myself out of a situation a lot easier than Daughter which seemed a bit obvious, and a couple of small strange things happen but I'm not doing spoilers.

The only reason why I wanted to watch it was because of the high ratings. Now, the film did have a nice build-up, very nice action scenes. However, the ending was horrible!! This is a movie were you expect to have an ending where there is no real ending. Trust me, you will be cursing at the TV by the time you finish this movie. I don't know whether or not the directors/writers see this as funny or not....... It's not!! Don't do this to fans, unless you already be approved for a sequel.!!!!!

There are several dramatic apices during the viewing, but I was never dropped below a certain treshold of heightened interest.

539,ulmanm,"When everyone is lying, there is no place for truth.",6,10 June 2019,"How do you recognize a ""millennial"" sci-fi?
it has gorgeous CGI, realistic interiors and exteriors, good design.it features apocalyptic theme, where Earth is destroyed by some natural / man-made disaster.it expresses utter hate of human race and its natural state.and last but not least: it never actually ends, leaving the viewer scratching their head, pondering what might have been.""I am Mother"" is no different.The design is top-notch. The drones, their concept, the facility, the down-to-earth elements such as the all-important incinerator. There is huge attention to detail everywhere you look. Yes, the ""setting"" is done top-notch! Bravo!The Earth has been destroyed. By whom or what is never really explained - or rather it is explained in a confusing and contadictory way depending on the character doing the explaining. From the philosophical point of view, it really is unimportant whether it was the Skynet that shot first or the North Korean government pushed the red button. Whether a supervolcano blew up or the man-made virus went, ahem, ""viral"" and killed everyone. The end result is: humans are extinct, down to the last man, woman and child and Earth is scorched. From a viewer's point though, the explanations are lacking and fragmentary, and as a result I felt the film was not sufficiently grounded in reality to make the rest of the story believable.The director must really hate humanity and its natural state of existence. In the grim future the humans are not born but made, just as you would make a cup of tea - stick the bag in, add water. They are raised not by loving parents but by an AI, who has been loaded with library-worth knowledge of Origami and full university course of philosophy, with viewpoints - again - often contradicting each other. In this new world there is no need for fatherly love. There is no need for balanced family. There is no need to iron out the problems that plague the modern society. And there is no place for failed humans. There is only a sterile, loveless environment, where the new Eve is being groomed under a watchful eye of the the all-knowing AI. Which is as fickle as the rest of the cast, as if the director couldn't quite decide whether it should be a mustache-twirling villain or a magnanimous benefactor.The movie, predictably, ends with a fart. And not one of those mighty ones, which would result from you holding gas all evening during posh dinner. Oh no. It's one of those quiet, smelly, unassuming parps, which leaves everyone in the room looking around suspiciously.
Waaaay too many loose ends here. Is the Woman the APX01? If so, how did she survive? Were there other humans? Was she released from the facility as a toddler and ""delivered"" by the AI to humans hiding in the mines? Or were there no other humans at all, and she was sustained by timely deliveries of food and water by the AI? Who shot her? Why was she shot? How did she find her way to the shelter? Was it all on purpose? Who were the people sketched in the book? Where did the dog come from and how did he/she survive a week being locked in a container in the summer? How come the droid leaves its security-access-enabling spare hand just lying around? It surely can't be oversight, so it is meant to be found, as, what, a test? Are the droids the actual enemy? Have they killed the rest of the humans or did the humans destroy themselves? Who's ""they""? Is the Daughter going to torch the place down after shooting Mother? Or is she going to raise an army of clones hell-bent on destroying the AI overlord, thus beginning the new cycle of violence? Will AI let her?In the end I felt messed about, with not enough concrete facts to support an educated guess, but instead a whole lot of ""Just As Planned"" and ""Unspoken Plan Guarantee"" tropes floating around. For me there were just too many unexplained twists and too much guesswork, which in the end made the movie less thought out it pretends to be.6 out of 10 stars for good setting and good acting.",I Am Mother

That ending produced enough dissatisfaction that it made me regret investing the prior 1-3/4 hours.With regard to the review just prior to this one, wherein the reviewer finds fault with an earlier review that wrote that there was a timeline error that would have made Daughter 38 years old.

Some here claim that there was no timeline error because the character, Daughter, was the third embryo to be hatched, and that the Hillary Swank character was the first embryo hatched. I agree that Daughter was the third attempt, and that would account for the 38 years that had elapsed at the time where Daughter was only a teen.However, when the screen displayed the elapsed time of 13000+ days, it also displayed that there were ONLY 1 human alive. Since Daughter was then alive (a teen) and on-screen, that would mean that there were no other humans alive, which would mean that the Swank character did not exist.

The music and intensity of some of the scenes are gripping and the movie keeps you engaged the entire way through.My main issue however is, we get it the injured woman (Hilary Swank) is APX01. For the people saying that this went over people's head, I don't believe that's the case. My problem is with how they lazily expected the audience to interpret that without explaining or even attempting to give the audience the information necessary to understand that.The major questions we are left with are:
1) Who were these people APX01 had memories of?
2) Why couldn't APX01 remember being raised there? Are we just suppose to believe she wiped her memory?
3) Was APX01's memory never wiped and she simply came to the facility to save APX03 by lying about there being other people?
4) If APX01 was just lying then why didn't mother kill her at the door instead of compromise everything she had going?
All of these questions could have easily been answered by a simple dialogue or conversation between APX01 and Mother in the shopping container at the end. But instead of giving the audience the context and information necessary to be a ""plot twist"" it just seems lazy, like they felt like giving the audience the cliche of ""leaving it up to the imagination"". The problem is that only works when you have enough information to formulate your idea (e.g. Inception).Again I thought this movie had a great idea and capitalized well on the scene and scenario it painted. I just wish writers would stop doing this ""leave it up to the audience"" thing incorrectly and at least give us the tools to understand the picture they are attempting to paint.",I Am Mother

Not under budgeted, very good acting, but most of all the narrative and logic was something I have not seen in many American movies. I really hope America will do more of these kind of movies. Dilemmas, Logic, Ethics, Realism - as harsh as it may be. Even though it was had a dark theme, you could say there is still a happy ending, which America likes. Though perhaps with some bitter taste.But the truth is always a bitter pill to swallow.I wish we could respond to previous users reviews. I wanted to agree with a highly voted review, that this movie kept me on the edge of my seat, where I thought: Which possibility of an outcome will the narrator choose? I saw many ideas coming, I saw the terminator reference when puncturing in the wound, but the end was truly something new! So fresh! After seeing many sci-fi movies, you think you saw everything, and the human mind couldn't possibly come up with something new, there has already been thought of everything - but here comes this movie that comes with such a small little adaptation to a major ""robot terminator"" plot - that makes it great - somehow gives hope, though I agree with most robot/ai doomsday movies - the future could be very dangerous.",I Am Mother

At the beginning I believe it gives us a really strong hint of what is going to happen just with mother words ""Motthers need time to learn"" you straight away get a clue with this. The movie pass by and you start getting some clues, specially when a Woman called just like that ""Woman"" appears and it give us way more clues, with ""Daughter"" Getting more curious and ""Woman"" driving here to be while ""Mother"" attemps to stop everything you can see how the history develops until at the end everything makes send, the mission of mother, what she wanted to create and what was the mission of Woman.

563,sammywaslow-37730,Of Mice and Women,8,8 January 2021,"To re-iterate - SPOILERS AHEAD!
Love sci-fi but definitely not an aficionado or even a movie and cinema buff. Just wanted to point out a few things not yet mentioned and pose a few questions about this movie.
The ending first - I'm not sure I agree with other reviewers who seem to assume that Woman (APX01) was dispensed with by the 'other' (collective) Mother. She reached for a tyre lever before Mother stormed into the container but I'm wondering if the good old trope of robots underestimating human's sheer will to live prevailed? After all, we earlier saw Woman almost best Mother with a home made shiv. And on a related note, doesn't the first law of robotics come into play here? As stated earlier, I'm not an expert or die hard Asimov fan so apologies if there is an obvious answer to this.
As others have pointed out, there are lots of little clues scattered throughout the movie. Some make sense and are obvious in hindsight (i.e. second viewing!) but others pose more questions. For instance, we are told that 1 day has elapsed since the Extinction Event yet there is obviously still some sort of battle taking place (distant explosions, dust falling from ceiling, etc.). Are the droids mopping up the last pockets of resistance? Or is it the aftershocks from the bombs, or meteor strike, or whatever? It's probably not important but, if the former, then I think it paints Mother in a more sinister light.
We learn that a mouse causes the whole facility to shutdown by gnawing through some wires (side note: Apx03 repairs the wires so why doesn't she just shutdown the complex again later in the movie?). Mouse is captured and becomes a metaphor for Apx03 - trapped, alone, an object for study and experimentation. Mother overreacts and incinerates the unfortunate rodent - the first domino has fallen. Realising she longs for contact with carbon based life form (we see her watching a documentary on dogs), a yearning exacerbated by Mother's clinical but utilitarian birthday gift of replacement pyjamas, Apx03 ventures to the airlock which pushes the movie into the next gear.
A few others have picked up on the biblical references. The names of the men in the sketches? Simon was a disciple of Jesus and Lucas (Luke) a Gospel writer. The scene in which 01 holds the shiv to 03's throat is a direct play from the Wisdom of Solomon. In a true act of selfless love (you can see I'm conflicted about Mother's true intentions - sinister or no!?), Mother would rather lose 03 than see her harmed. Similarly, at the denouement, Mother instructs the droids to 'stand down' (the last bolt of the airlock is just about to be cut through when welding suddenly stops) just before 03 decommissions her which is the ultimate act of sacrifice. The scene then cuts to Apx01's container shelter where we see religious iconography - pictures and statues of Mary, the Mother of the Son of God who KNEW she was only birthing him to be sacrificed for the eventual redemption of mankind (or so the Christian narrative goes).",I Am Mother
564,tuchka,Good movie raising questions,7,29 September 2019,"I am Mother adds another layer to the problem of coexistence of humans and AI. It keeps the viewer's attention while making him/her thinking about complexity and origin of moral.
The movie would be even more interesting if it touched the questions of why AI needs humans at all and why it thinks that creation of new, more moral, better version of humans is a feasible task, especially after the rich experience of differnt utopias in 20th centrury.",I Am Mother
565,ak_fox_47,My thoughts on the movie/rating issue-No spoilers-Don't watch the trailers,9,2 July 2019,"I intentionally avoided the trailer before watching it, you should avoid it too... I really mean it... I really, really do... what moron made that?I'll be honest here, this movies isn't the next 2001...
Thankfully... (I'll always have mixed feelings about it) it's still probably one of the best sci-fi movies from the last few years. I actually found it to be far better than Ex Machina(2014) that has a higher rating. Well that doesn't tell too much(for me it was a pain to watch because it was a rehash of half a dozen sci-fi movies I've seen before). And dear lord that atrocity that I won't name made by Luc Besson with Scarlett Johansson, almost has a similar rating... they had the guts to call it a ""sci-fi"" ...it's just a horrible fantasy movie.I Am Mother is probably the best of the Netflix Thriller/Sci-fi/Horror movies that had similar end of the world stories. The movie is probably up there with the new Blade Runner, Moon and Cloverfield Lane 10(if you liked those you should check this out). Not as cinematic as Arrival but more reasonable/down to earth with no pseudo-sci/fi elements.
If you actually understand what is going on there are basically no plot-holes(no movie is perfect, the holes are kept at reasonable levels and/or are easily explained due to the nature of the setting), the characters are well acted. The CGI, effects and design are great.About the low score: Some say it was too complex others say it was too simple. Some say it had too much action others complain there was too little. Some complain about character development or inconsistencies in the way characters act, however I found the movies reasons more than adequate to present the story the way it did and have the characters act the way they did.From my perspective the movie delivers what it sets out in the beginning. It is one of the most well thought out and well delivered movies I've seen in a while(surprisingly so). Let's just say that when it comes to movies I usually think that things should have been done differently(as many others, but I have a degree in it too) ...but I can hardly think of something that I found worth to be changed(ex. more buildup in the beginning may have helped but I don't think the added length would have been worth it, I'm pretty sure it was edited out exactly for that reason)There is a certain movie that has a really similar plot (big budget Hollywood movie), but a different ending. I won't name it. Somehow this feels like it was more tight, had less useless stuff, is more to the point. The similarities may not be that apparent and that movie is more complex in general but for some reason this felt more right, more realistic story and character-wise.Great movie, please disregard the low rating, if you like good sci-fi movies you should definitely watch it!",I Am Mother
566,SocialistProg,Best Netflix Movie I've Ever Seen,10,22 June 2019,"I won't give any spoilers out as best as possible. Anyone accustomed with Netflix produced movies who've watched them over the years, probably are going to be familiar with how they are made along the lines of small visual productions and small not so detailed sets regardless of the movie genre. This movie is no different. It doesn't have spectacular visuals, elaborate technological mechanics, even the setting areas are very limited. So don't decide to watch it with high expectations with those aspects in mind, watch because you want to think really deep and hard.Having said that, the story is something totally amazing. If you liked movies like Ex Machina or even a bit like Blade Runner, with an incredible AI character which has a mechanical look, where its dialogue really makes one think about what is going on during the movie and keeps you guessing, contemplating and getting varying feelings for the characters, then this is it. In my experience, this was a bit deeper than Ex Mechina. There are bits of activity whether computed, medically given or during instructional periods that are nuanced where you may or may not catch them with the eye. But these small pieces are the biggest telltale parts to how the story plays out.If you watch this movie and feel lost and confused on its ending, or that it really was not satisfying, I can assure you missed these parts, because they tell the premise behind Mother, and what her end goal was for in the basis of her existence. This movie is A+++ on plot outcome!",I Am Mother
567,service-151,But?!,7,26 September 2019,"Am I the only person that thinks A--01 and A--03 were clones? They were cast to look startlingly similar. I know they were part of the same social experiment created by the droid consciousness to solve the humanity problem, but they also appeared to be cloned. Thoughts?Additionally, I do feel there was some confusing ambiguity and would like to see a director's cut. Namely, the portraits drawn by 01 and descriptions of their personalities and roles. It could be that this ties back into religion and I simply do not know enough about Catholic saints to be able to answer these questions myself. Even if that's the case....why the story that she was running with a group and separated and...make up relationships...yeah, this whole component doesnt process well for me the way it was presented. She was clearly herded by AI to the bunker and shot for her trouble as well.A--02 is also a place of blank space. Why a jawbone? Why plant it? If mother values human life above all else, what was the offense that resulted in her death? Maybe there will be a ""I am mother"" sequel to taken us into the black hole of A--02, as I am more curious about this than the life of A--01, though we would presumably brush up against that as well.I agree that the entire feel of this film was very Moon-ish, right down to my clone suspicion, which I had from the start of the film before A--01 even entered the picture. For this moonish reason, the first half of the film can feel rather long. Did the ending make up for the lag? That's for each person to decide.From an acting standpoint, this movie felt strictly sci-fi and sterile toward the AI presence. You know from the start that the AI presence is something to fear. Had there been more ambiguity about that, I would have been on more of an emotional journey when A--03 had to make the tough choice at the end. Instead, I was emotionally detached because I was only glad to see the droid go. Had there been more time spent on that element and relationship in a way that evoked the sympathy of the viewer, I might have struggled with daughter. That would certainly ha e made this film richer for me.",I Am Mother

569,piousbox-815-764319,An excellent show!,8,24 June 2019,"A suspenseful drama, and a great look into technology and AI. A realistic and detailed portrayal of automation. Great special effects. Very human.I liked the robot. It's a challenge to produce a realistic mechanical character that is neither too human nor too robotic. I think this one is just right, and the programmed movements looked how I would expect them to look. I watched some other movie with a ""robot"" there and immediately thought, no that's a human, you can see it breathing and twitching its cute little muscle tissue. So the robot in I Am Mother looks robotic enough. Maybe something Boston Dynamics would build.The movie explores interesting topics, what it means to be humane, what is compassion. How valuable is it in our lives, and how valuable should it be?A robot does not have to resemble a human, it doesn't have to be android. You can have 100 arms mounted on a wall, have caterpillar tracks instead of legs, have inverted knees for better kinetic efficiency, etc. However! Already if you have to grow up with no society, it'd be pretty weird with all sorts of unexpected problems, busted sense of personal space, possibly inability to communicate, again lack of compassion - so the mother robot, actually, it is required to be human-like. To have a sense of normality of interaction.The attention to detail makes it very appealing to me.

I LOVE the clever suspense throughout Act 1 and 2. I definitely felt torn between trusting Mother, and the stranger who we later find out was actually the first human born at the facility. The twist and turns were disturbing, but they made sense to me. Therefore, contrary to what many reviewers seem to think, I don't believe the (main) reason some people didn't enjoy the movie was because they failed to comprehend the whole story. Personally, what made me take 2 stars off the rating was the fact that I couldn't get myself to feel emotional about the third act, and especially the farewell between Mother and Daughter. In addition, the amount and clunkiness of exposition in the third act really made the characters' behavior feel forced, and made the story feel clumsy. If Daughter's reaction was anything to go by, I was sure I was supposed to feel terribly sad and yet invigorated by the end. Instead, I didn't know what I should feel. I actually experienced less emotion in the third act than I did in either of the first two, and that's where the film's flaw truly lies. It's not a bad film by any means, and I very much enjoyed the experience. But the third act lacked a force of emotionality powerful enough to push the film into greatness. People actually ""get it"", but they can't ""feel it"".",I Am Mother

581,mobcritter,An over simplified explanation,7,3 July 2019,"The Netflix movie: ""I Am Mother,"" an over simplified explanation with SPOILERS
What came before:
Humans create the robots and the AI that controls them. Its purpose is to protect and nurture the whole of humanity. The AI determines that the greatest threat to the wellbeing of humanity are the individual humans themselves. They are selfish and self-indulgent. The AI logically concludes that the best course of action is to remove the current humans and raise a new, caring, and self-sacrificing breed of humans. The AI executes the plan.
What happens during the movie:
The robot Mother is raising and training (or indoctrinating and programming) a single human, Daughter. Why just one? It reduces the number of variables, thus increasing the possibility of success. Why a girl child? The selection of a girl child may be based on the sexist assumption that females are inherently more nurturing than males, more motherly or maternal. This may be a good time to address the possibility of there being other incubation facilities. There could be thousands of them scattered around the globe. Each facility tests different variations of the plan in an attempt to improve the chances of achieving success. That would, however, be an entirely different movie. This movie shows the events at a single incubation facility. There have been previous daughters, but the movie is only concerned with the current effort. This Daughter has successfully passed each stage in her development, so far.
Then came Woman. She is purported to be from a small remnant colony of humans who have survived the robot apocalypse and are living in a mine somewhere. However, in reality, Daughter has entered the next stage of her training, and Woman is part of that - the temptation of freedom, of cutting the apron strings and becoming your own person. This test too, she finally passes by sacrificing her desires to her brother's needs.
One of the robots seeks out Woman, and the AI speaks through it, ""as if someone had a purpose for you, until now."" The Woman was created by the robots solely for the final test. Now that she's played her part, she's no longer needed.
Daughter becomes Mother.",I Am Mother

The ambiguity of character affiliations affecting the judgment of the little girl makes you ponder over the question of man vs machine.

Also, the acting is brilliant and the cinematography is top notch.One suggestion, keep your eyes open from the very beginning. If you watch it carefully, it'll take you on a trippy ride.

584,OttoWei,Visually stunning/weak tention,6,9 June 2019,"Ehat we have here is a film that pays homeage to so many sci-fi classics but still somehow manage to stand on it's own. There is good acting and wounderful special effects and sets, it looks good. To take the diffrent refrences that as examples may put light on where this is not a new unforgettable movie. Where The Terminaitor was a action with high pace, always on the run, terror in the air movie, I am mother delivers some gun shooting and some scary robots but you feel relativly safe and no one is gonna die here anyway. When 2001 Space oddyssy hade HAL 3000, as a zero-emotion psyco killer, this bad-robot never gets under your skin, the story takes another turn before it gets too unconftable. And when Moon had you gasping when the secret plot was revealed, you can't help but to feel like ""I saw that coming"". One other thing is the cinamagraphics, towards the end there are two shots where the protagonist is scared and there a close up on her face and big eyes, and soon after she raises from behind a table - it's obvious homage to Alien, only so much more boring and generic. It feels like a tv-series.
There are also time where the style changes dramatically, for the most part the camera shows nothing that the main character does not experience, but in a outdoor seen in the late part we suddenly get a drone-perspective overview that the characters could possibly not experience, and at a time where the film tries to make you feel scared and fragil towards a unknown enemy.
I just don't know what this movie want to be. It has fights and gunsbut it's no action, it's has mystery but doesn't trust it to be interesting enough, it has blood and physical pain but cuts to soon for it to make it disturbing.

586,caspar-commijs,Not breaking new ground,3,13 August 2019,"I didn't have high expectations for 'I am Mother' due to it's subject matter being one that many sciene fiction movies have made an attempt to say something about. Half an hour into the movie, when the mouse was discovered by the airlock I felt like a proper tension was set up and I hoped it would keep building. It did for a little up to the point where the woman from outside was captured in the infirmary. The film then gets bogged down in the daughter's quest to find out if either the woman from outside or the robot that raised her should be trusted. To which the answer is what pretty much anyone who has seen any movie about robots and AI could have guessed. The fact the collectieve artificial intelligence didn't mean it all bad but only did what it was created for: saving mankind by exterminating mankind, was presented as this total mind blowing plot twist whilst you have already been presented the evidence the robots took over and the facility, when obviously authorized and maintained by the robots, must have some purpose yeah? And besides, How many times have we heard this before? This movie excells at leading you to certain conclusions, almost making you expect them to do something new with this or surprise you, to then maybe half an hour and three or four more explicit hints later completely confirm these conclusions like they are the most mind warping unexpected thing that could possibly happen. And the thing is, not that much happens at all really. When halfway through the movie I started realising that this was probably it for the next hour or so I found most scenes tedious to watch. I read a couple of reviews who praise the film for the whole math thing with the different daughters and the outside woman being the first. I didn't make that conclusion after the first watch even though when you do pay attention to the numbers it is pretty obvious. The thing is I don't care really because I don't feel like that was what the movie was about either. I mean what does that tell us? That the first one escaped and became another failed experiment? I mean if the daughter had figured this out and learned from her mistake so she could make the right choice, that would be an interesting premise. The thing is, daughter never figures anything out really. She is told most of her primary discoveries. The central conflict and premise of this movie are very hard to spot and not executed in a way that I as a viewer knew only just enough what was going on and wondered what was going to happen next. There was no suspense in this movie that seems to want to be a sci-fi psychological thriller. I was foremost dissapointed it didn't break any new ground for me, and secondly quite annoyed most of the time watching that it didn't leave any deducing to me but just explained every clichéd idea they put in it.",I Am Mother

I really enjoyed this film.The whole movie I was confused about the time since the extinction event, 13000 days seemed like too many years for the girl to be the very same girl we saw at the beginning, wasn't till the very end lf the movie when I realized the woman was the first girl, raised to be the final test for the third girl, that was ""the purpose someone had for her"".

The film is just great! The scenario, setting, acting, twists... it just keeps you interested and surprised. While I do agree that there wasn't really a peak in suspence and excitement, I am Mother shows us that that's not really necessary to make an awesome film. No need for much action and definitely no need to answer all the questions those who gave it low rating are asking. What had to be shown was shown and what needed explanation was explained. Some things can be left out - e.g. as one reviewer asks how did the woman survive out there? Did she get food and water delivered to her?Now, does that really matter?!!!!!! Does it change the scenario of this particular period that takes place in the film? Does it matter so much that it influences your rating?I can't believe how low people nowadays are rating films! Same thing happened to Bird Box and all the low rating and criticism came from people who had ""too many unanswered questions"" that do not even have to be answered. To those I say just ""grow up and get your imagination working"". Really good films require some thinking along with the watching. And I am Mother is one of those!",I Am Mother

610,thoriumop,Don't trust the bad reviews! They didn't understand the movie,10,8 June 2019,"***SPOILERS***First I'll address some of the bad reviews and then I'll write a general review with some side-rant :)The people who rated the movie poorly seem to have either not watched the film or lack some sort of basic intelligence. Most of the plot holes, issues or thing that ""wouldn't happen"" we're justified/justifyable. One person said that the robot was too dumb in the film and that real AI wouldn't be that dumb. Clearly that person failed to realize that everything that happened was the robot's intent. So if everything worked as the robot had intended, how does that make the robot dumb? The robot literally said to the woman in the shipping crate that she no longer served a purpose to her (the robot). As I was watching the film, I figured one of the scenarios was that the whole thing was a test for the girl and that in the end the girl passed. The robot's ultimate objective is to create a better human, one with ethical, moral, psychological and emotional superiority.General Review: The movie is quite a good sci-fi movie. As a massive sci-fi fan myself and as an Aeronautical Engineer (specifically space related), I am both educated on some of the things presented in the film and interested in what is presented in the film. Obviously some of the things in the film are indeed science fiction, but nothing in the movie that I saw was impossible (great movies skate the line between fiction and reality, makes it more believeable). From start to finish, you, the viewer, are constantly debating who to trust, the robot or the human. The writers did a good job and allow the viewer to be warmed up to the robot and present the more human side of the robot. I think this is critical in helping develop the story because you need to trust the robot and if the film went straight into the action you wouldn't trust the robot at all. So after a brief introduction I'd say that as a viewer, myself, I was about 50/50. This lays the ground for the rest of the film. So as your human side and logical side battle , the movie continues to provide information that keeps you conflicted. As the movie goes deeper you begin to piece things together and the picture becomes more clear. At this point, where things click, you are beginning to see the moral dilemma (similar to the one provided in the film, now writing this and fully realizing, the film goes from a 9 star to 10). The human race is the dilemma. You have two choices. You can choose to not wipe out humanity and humans will continue to suffer or you can wipe out humanity and build a better human kind so that there is a greater benefit in the long run (think thousands of years, also related to Utilitarianism and lots of other ethical shizz). For example (similar to the film's logic), imagine 8 billion people in current times (somewhat discontent) vs. 8 billion people who are smarter, more ethical, more kind, more rational, etc... That would be a damn good world. This is the dilemma the audience arrives at as the film reaches it's climax. The robot is trying to build a better world at the cost of the old world. Is this ethical (there is no ""right"" answer)? The fact that they included the robot teaching the girl ethics confirms this idea. I thought it was strange that the robot was teaching this girl (presuming the character is supposed to be a teenager, but the actor is 21) such detailed ethics at a young age. In the film they mentioned Kantian ethics and such. Anyways, the whole idea of the film is sort of like arguing whether or not Thanos is a bad guy. From many ethical perspectives you can say that Thanos is actually in the right and from just as many ethical perspectives you can say the Avengers are the good guys. There honestly is no wrong answer, in my opinion. That's why I think this film was such a great film because it was so much more than a surface-level sci-fi film. All of the people who rated the movie bad didn't understand the underlying point of the film. These people just want a lazy movie that tells them what to think. I love movies that allow you to think for yourself and actually force you to do just that. The movie says (not literally): ""create your own ideas"", which is important in a society where people are constantly telling you how to think.",I Am Mother
611,namolokaman,Outstanding!,10,11 June 2019,"Outstanding sci-fi movie! Interesting story. Excellent acting. A few nods to sci-fi classics here and there. Shades of Moon, Terminator, Chapie, Aliens, and Ex Machina. The visual effects are shockingly good and realistic; especially the robot!

619,sheridantodd,Wonderfully dramatic story with brilliant acting and a strong Sci-Fi script that kept me engaged to the end.,10,9 June 2019,"This movie really surprised me. It surprised me in a way so few big-budget Hollywood movies do any more. It had real heart, great drama, and an intricate story that built gradually but satisfactorily until the end. I rarely like movies that focus on human-robot interaction because I find them contrived and unbelievable. The acting in this really was believable, the characters compelling, and the quality of the sets, CG, and music was excellent all-around.I'd say this is a real winner. The young female lead actress was really fantastic, Hillary Swank (who I've never really connected with) was an excellent choice for this role and did an excellent job, and the robot itself was actually rather well done.

624,matthewberight,Interesting premise blemished by glaring plot holes,3,10 June 2019,"Was the pacing slow? Yes, but digestible.
Was the set beautiful and believable? Convincingly so.
Was the plot believable? Only if you have a superhuman ability to ignore logic and just 'go with it' which should be the title of this film.SPOILERS:
I went into this movie excited at the prospect of exploring a 'reset' future similar to 2014's 'A Giver'. You know, exploring idealistic human future societies that are supposedly morally superior.
This movie let me down immediately by having the human aspect of a mother replaced with a robot that does an unconvincing job of being a parental mother; no scenes were shot showing the child asking obvious inquisitive questions like 'why are you a robot, where are the other humans, what happened in the past, etc etc'. You are just expected to believe this child developed language and an identity without any cultural background information.
""Just go with it"" should be the title of this movie.
It continues like this as you watch, where the robot has downtime needed to recharge its batteries so for some reason all cameras are off letting the protagonist get up to mischief because the AI is either oblivious or omniscient and actually wants mischief to happen (What? Why?).
Then when nearing the end the mother says to 'daughter', ""pick a fetus to develop, it doesn't matter which"" and yet the child created is of another race, surely a new concept to this girl that there are other races, leading to more questions that will be brushed aside 'shhh just go with it I'm a robot'.It's a pretty film, but also a pretty forgettable film raising more questions than answering and leaving you quite annoyed at the time spent on it.",I Am Mother
625,kanter-35787,"Stunning psychological sci-fi thriller. My Observations, fact finding and some thoughts.",10,11 June 2019,"First of al, I'd like to start as other reviewers have that are leaving positive ratings; if your not looking to think, or want to digest an easy to handle sci-fi action flick, then this movie is not for you, or not for you at that time.If you like critical thinking, questions surrounding borderline ethical choices, a visceral slow-burn sci-fi with a meaningful and thought provoking message that contains pleasing visuals (so much attention to details) and a well placed soundtrack then look no further.**************************************SPOILERS*****************************************Yes, this movie is designed to make you think and wonder if humanity would be better off starting over with a ""hard reboot."" Man creates AI. AI surpasses man in every way, literally becomes ""the creator and the destroyer,"" and attempts to reboot mankind by starting over from scratch. The idea itself is not new to the genre, but the story, characters, acting and dialog are done extremely well. This movie sucks you in and keeps you vested until the very end, and dare I say wanting more (which is a good thing). It is delivered in a way not many others have accomplished before. Thought provoking on par with Kubrick, Nolan, and the directors that gave you Encino Man.It has been mentioned far too many times in other reviews that there are plot holes that are left open, opportunities missed, and sometimes simple mistakes overlooked. I say that the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that common sense isn't always so common. From memory of watching the movies just two hours ago, I can only think of 2, maybe 3 instances where the information is left too ambiguous and we have to assume for ourselves. I believe everything else is explained. Let me make some points, and hopefully get those that came here for answers, to get their creative thinking juices flowing. -----------------------------------------If you're still with me then I am going to assume that you have watched the movie. Some of these will be short, but if you have watched you will know what I mean. I will try my best to stay in chronological order of the movie and point out some of the less obvious stuff (some of this has been covered in other reviews, some not as of yet).--Everything was planned. From the childhood training, surgical training, finding out the truth about the bullet pulled from the woman, how the woman was shot by ""other droids"", the food given to the woman in the hospital bed (""comfort food"".... not healthy. We're talking mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, okay...some peas), etc.All meticulously planned by Mother. Time has no meaning when you don't age.--Of course the hazmat suit was a plant, it was intentionally left there.--Allowing daughter to open the door for a human who was injured, prior to daughter knowing that there was no virus; thus sacrificing herself and her safety to help others in need. Test, passed. Refer back to the ethical questions during the doctor test.--The surgery is a final test on how well daughter can perform as a doctor. Daughter passed.--lying about the virus and when and how she finds out about the virus, set-up for test...
...telling daughter she lied for the greater good (about the virus) and they way that she found out, test. Mother wanted to know how she would process that information and if she would make the correct ethical choice to help those in need; using logic,reasoning, empathy AND compassion above impulsive choices to just close the door and walk away. Passed.--The mines and the talk about the mines. I believe this is one of only a few issues that are ambiguous and may have been slightly overlooked...The mines... 2 theories. a) If you watch again, I believe that there were more embryos missing than just 3. Mother planted the mine as a social experiment, leading ax01 to them.... a social group experiment for a group setting, and how they would react if a newcomer showed up and what they would do to survive, or b) the mines never happened. Made up memories due to ptsd, extreme psychological distress and extreme isolation. Woman was cray cray after being out on her own and ""hunted"" for years.... bringing us to: ax01 was never ""let go"" or escaped. She was allowed to leave so mother could record what she would do, and this was her (Ax01) test... failed.-- Letting daughter leave, after seeing and finding out that she (ax03) has been ""aborted"". Also a test; referring back to her lesson about making the correct choice in the situation where daughter is the doctor and healthy, but is the only one who has compatible organs for the other 5 humans.... would she sacrifice herself for the survival of the others? Yes, letting daughter believe she would be killed if she came back (or stayed) was planted. The test was to see if she would sacrifice herself for the greater good of saving the others (brother and embryos) at the cost of her own life. She came back thus passing that test.
---- I'll admit... woman putting a knife to daughter's throat could not have been planned; i think this is one of those situations where we are left to rationalize that mother had thought of this scenario, and deduced that if she let them both go unharmed that woman would not intentionally harm daughter.-- For Ax01? Entire life up until the end was a test. The woman may have failed to be the next mother, but how would she fair out in the world on her own? How would she react to mother, whom when (re)introduced to woman showed nothing but compassion... but was subjected to (perceived) violent AI for a long period of time? Woman was given the chance to not only survive but thrive in the bunker. Test failed (by Ax01). Her lasting hatred and unwillingness to change led to her ultimate demise. With daughter passing the tests and ax01 failing her last test, the experiment was concluded. As mother said, ""it's as if you have been able to survive alone for so long for a reason, as if someone had a higher purpose for you."" Well that purpose has been fulfilled now that ax01 has proven that she overwhelmingly failed.--The figures drawn by ax01? Drawings of religious figures, more than likely from a religious book planted by mother (ambiguous again, more than likely Catholic Christian book). What would ax01 do if she found religion, would she hate AI even more and buy in religious ideologies? And the drawings names? Simon (saint)... can't remember other names right now but they were saints as well; the names of these saints come from a religion and were based from a nurturing god, not a wrathful god.--Leaving the droid hand out? Test. Will daughter do what is necessary to find the truth, given more than one option? When posed with an ethical grey area, would she bend the rules, choose the lesser of two evils (use hand and break in, or blindly follow claims from an external source with no factual evidence?). Test for: ""given the situation, which option is more ethical?"" Finding the truth was the correct answer.--Mother letting daughter shoot her? Closure, but with a simple reminder letting her know that she will always be around ( in a super nice ""if you need me you know where...."" kinda way. Plus, daughter has no idea that mother has, and can record everything. Mothers bunker shell doesn't matter what-so ever but psychologically provides closure for daughter, letting her think that mother is on the "" outside"" no longer interfering.-- The last test is to see how she will raise the embryos with all of her life training and given the fact that she knows mother (assumed so, this was never given how the race actually became extinct) killed the race and why she did, but raised her to be the second coming and a fully devoted mother, how will she manage with this knowledge? With acceptance and willingness, or with revenge and hatred? Remember, mother will always be there, watching and waiting. Test - not yet completed.--Logic, reason, compassion, ethics and morality (the greater good), deduction, ability to make clear choices under extreme stress. This whole movie from the time we arrive at her current age was the final test. Technically daughter is still taking the final ""test"".Bonus food for thought:-- Ax01 life experiences? Wrathful god. AX03? Nurturing god, which works best for the survival of the human race? Nurturing - passed by mother; remember she said that AX03 and this ""test"" was as much as a test of her abilities as it was for daughter.--I'll admit ax02's demise is a bit ambiguous, but I find it very hard to believe that ax02 was killed for not passing some tests and furthermore, I believe that this director (and movie) are far too intelligent to miss an oversight / plot hole as large as the adult human jawbone left in the incinerator. I am willing to venture that the bone was planted like everything else. You really think of all the bones in a human body, the jaw bone would not be destroyed AND somehow fall behind the incinerator table? Ambiguous and highly doubtful, but possible.-- One of the only other things I think we are left to guess is that the fine art that mother had ad01 focus on was drawing / artist... daughter was dancer. Both forms of art but in different expressions ushering different feelings and emotions.",I Am Mother

The film is a masterpiece from beginning to end.If you are an average Netflix user like me, and you love good sci-fi movies, then you are probably often disappointed about their productions. However, every general rule has an exception: this is the exception.Not only is it a visually well-made film -especially the robot- but the performance of the lead actress (Clara Rugaard) will thrill you. The movie has also interesting philosophical elements that will make you think from beginning to end. The story is coherent and will only be revealed at the end.

If you hated it on your first watch, break out your calculator to determine just how long the facility has been running, and compare that to the two human characters in the film. And then make sure you watch every. single. scene. so you get taken on the wild mental ride this film provides.Even the dialog from Mother gives clues as to what's going on, and the last scene Woman and Mother have together will give you the answers you had when you finished your first watch.I found this film so brilliant in all ways, I finally created an account to leave a review because I got frustrated with all of the poorly written reviews from the folks who just didn't get it.For reference, SciFi movies rank at the bottom of my ""movies I enjoy watching"" list.",I Am Mother
630,kkristiansenstride,Deeper despite first impression. This is one of the better movies where you have to think,10,14 June 2019,"At first impression the movie starts good and intense. But nothing wild compared to a lot of the other sci-fi's. As the movie progresses you get more eager to find out what's outside the door; a new world, a war, a fight, a dessert? Or a destroyed world perhaps?. About halfway you really begin to see the bigger picture of the movie, and need to constantly grabble with the ethics presented for you. Is mother right or wrong, good or bad - or a gray place with both. And how about the woman? And generally the bigger picture of the narrative? What does it tell us?This is one of the better 'think' movies. In the sort of Donnie darko and the butterfly effect. The movie has really great acting as well. I wanted to give a review between 7-10. There's not rly anything to improve about the movie, but I was a little sad about not finding out about the camp and what role that played with APXO1 - now when she was the first to be raised (and presumably left?) by the robot-mother, now when she presumably lived with the camp, after the total extinction. Maybe the camp just survived despite everyone else got wiped.. Anyways, this film deserves more attention - and last but not least, less mindless bad critic (imo). It seems like people reviewed this film without thinking, and thereby not granting them the opportunity to entertain themselves with the brilliant narrative of this film.
This is a clear worth-to-watch film!!",I Am Mother

On the study of the 3rd daughter, Mother do an exercise for the 3rd daughter (that exercise about saving 5 lives or 1 life), a clearly exercise about utilistarism, the third daughter even quotes explicitly Bentham.. Bentham was the ""tutor"" of John Stuart Mill (like Bentham,a utilistarist). My consideration is that Mother is utilitarist, thats why she decimated the humanity.
The basic principle of Bentham utilitarianism is that we should maximize pleasure and reduce pain. By this way, its fair enough eliminate the humanity to get a bigger pleasure in the future.
For me, I think this movie is also about the utilitarian perspective and its problem about the inviolability of the human body.(English isnt my native language, so maybe I wrote something wrong or anything like that, anyway, I think everyone can undestand what I wrote)",I Am Mother

But as the movie progressed to the end, I completely realised that the daughter was in training to become mother. In the beginning she questions her mother in the exam as to why she should sacrifice her life for people who may be potential thieves etc etc and mother asks her daughter if she believed that life is of significant value?"" so when the woman arrives the daughter showed her commitment to human life and the life of others, even how she was able to and won the test when she went back for her little brother.

640,pokemonstuh,"Visually appealing, but crumbles in the third act",6,21 July 2019,"The movie is quite interesting and has a few really good moments where twists are beautifully set up. Unfortunately they rarely seem to actually follow through. For example, a spoiler: Mother says the bullet that hit a lady was the same caliber as the ladies own gun. Daughter confronts her about it and lady says go check. This could be a great moment to cast doubt on lady. What's more, this could work even better if it was layer revealed that mother forged the evidence. But nope, mother just straight lied.The movie is okay but the third act is just so painfully predictable. I had been hoping for a whole movie about both influencers telling lies and truths, the constant deceit making me question who was in the wrong till the very end. Instead one of the two is just a straight up liar. The ending is pretty meh except for a theory that's floating around which makes it a bit cooler.Ultimately I guess I liked it, but it just fell apart too fast and too hard.",I Am Mother

The story is bleak, sad, hopeful and somewhat nicely abstract, just as a superior sci-fi story should be. The storytelling is compelling, with threads from many robot and AI inspired tales. One that leapt to mind was The Day the Earth Stood Still.
I was riveted throughout and enjoyed the superior direction and performances. The robot design is inspired, although I found the requirement for a nightly battery recharge, with complete cognitive shutdown, immediately jarring and on reflection, annoying.

644,jongor-83456,A classic AI story with a few new wrinkles,9,3 September 2019,"I am Mother is an enjoyable little sci-fi thriller. I watched the film purely on a recommendation from the Netflix engine without reading any reviews or seeing any trailers and I am very glad to have done so as this movie is worth developing your own unfiltered opinion about. The performances and voice-work is strong and although the story isn't entirely new/unpredictable, there is enough new flavor there to please fans of the genre, especially those who enjoy films/shows concerning the ethics of AI, like Ex Machina and WestWorld. This is not a horror movie at all, but there is enough there to qualify it as ""suspenseful"" even though I wouldn't say you will be on the edge of your seat for most of the film.The fact that this is a sci-fi that uses practical effects on a less-than-stellar budget is an extremely underrated aspect of this movie, and one of the reasons I gave this a 9 rather than a 7-8. Practical effects in sci fi movies are a dying art, and the creators of this film should be commended for going with animatronics and real machinery instead of a glut of CGI. This should be something that fans of older (read: 70s and 80s) sci-fi movies should greatly appreciate.Those looking for a bombastic big Hollywood movie about giant robots shooting thermonuclear devices and armageddon lasers at giant armies and fleets of human soldiers - kindly move along. This movie isn't for you. I have read every user review on IMDB for this movie and it is amazing how many of the negative ones absurdly criticize the movie for not being Terminator or the Matrix. Other reasons for negative reviews include ""the cast has too many women"", ""netflix movies all suck"", and ""I hate robots so this gets 1 star"". (Paraphrasing for expediency and because none of these reviews are good enough or interesting enough to link to). There are also several identical re-posts of the same bad reviews, which points to someone or a few someones having some kind of wierd personal agenda against the movie and trying to tank the rating. There's a good reason none of these useless reviews are at the top of the ""most helpful"" list.There are some legitimate reasons to not like this film (some reviewers said it did not add enough to the genre and although I disagree, I think it's a valid argument), but over 80% of the negative reviews for I am Mother at the time of this posting are petty, spiteful, and not reflective of the movie itself. If you are a fan of sci-fi and not just giant explosions, don't listen to these clowns and watch the movie.",I Am Mother

We know it's APX0 because this happens before the 13,867 days (ie ~38 years) passes. At the very end of the film, after APX03 runs back to the base, APX01 walks outside the moving crate and seeings an origami dog on the log.

647,mowery-00229,Interesting take on technology and humanity.,7,22 December 2019,"For a Netflix original movie, I found this movie to rather engaging throughout the viewing experience; I did not once get bored and want to turn the film off. (Spoilers ahead) The plot of the revolves around a cataclysmic extinction event. The audience is not shown or told what that event is or how it happened. The film starts with the viewing of a fortified place and the words of the name of the bunker, which houses embryos for the ""new"" human race. The next words on the screen are how many days have passed since the ""event""; 001. The next scene revolves around the initializing of a droid which then proceeds to open a cryo chamber and pull out a fetus pod. The droid puts the pod into a chamber which creates an artificial womb for the fetus to gestate; the fetus only takes 24 hours to gestate; this is shown by a countdown timer. The fetus is then removed from the sphere chamber and the droid proceeds to ""care"" for the infant. The next several scenes of the movie are ones in which we see the droid interacting with the infant/child as it continues to grow; the child appears to become bonded to the droid which is depicted by her moving her bed close to where the droid plugs in for the evening to recharge. Later we see the child at around pre-teen years she is watching an old episode of The Johnny Carson Show and the power fails to the complex. The girl goes to investigate and discovers that the power lines have been severed. Upon further discovery she finds a mouse has gotten in somehow and she captures it. When she restores power and ""mother"" (the droid) powers on and inquires what happened the girl tells her and the droid immediately takes the glass cylinder housing the mouse to the incinerator and disposes of the mouse. The girl is both horrified and upset by those events which the droid somehow senses and explains that the mouse could have been infected by the virus that caused the cataclysm years ago. This ""explanation"" seems to appease the girl and the movie moves forward to when the girl is older; the audience is not told but we can assume she is about 20. At this point she is studying ethics and is asked by ""mother"" to explain how she would handle a moral dilemma involving curing several sickly patients at the cost of one patient that could be either cured or not treated and allowed to die in order to harvest the organs for transplant to the other patients. The girl is disturbed by this and the droid simply explains that she is to think of the situation logically. From here the movie moves along and proceeds to the girl viewing the TV screen when she notices the lights flickering and something making noise. She heads for the airlock, suits up and opens the inner doors to discover that there is a woman banging on the outer doors begging to be let in; explaining that she has been shot. The girl reluctantly puts another suit in front of the outer doors then closes the inner doors and opens the outer ones. At this point an alarm sounds which activates the droid. The girl tells the woman to put on the suit quickly and hide that she would take care of the droid; the woman puts on the suit and passes out next to the inner doors. The droid comes and the girl explains she only opened the outer doors out of curiosity and apologized for being disruptive. The droid explains that because she was awake her exams could then begin. The girl goes to the exam room and pretends to start the exam but sneaks off to get the woman and hide her she then proceeds to gather medical supplies to try to attend to the gunshot wound the woman sustained. ""Mother"" intercepts the two of them; the woman wrestles the gun away from the girl and manages to get two shots off at the droid before the droid has time to subdue the woman. The droid takes the woman to the infirmary to be treated but the woman refuses believing that the droid is there to do her harm. Meanwhile ""mother"" and ""daughter"" have an exchange over the events which have occurred and ""mother"" tells the girl a partial truth, and explains that if they could find other survivors, they could come live with them in the facility. The woman develops a massive infection as a result of the injury and only allows the girl to treat her; this involves the girl having to dig out the bullet manually without administering anesthesia to the woman. The surgery is successful and the plot moves along with the girl and the woman getting to know one another better. The woman convinces the girl that the droid is not all that is seems to be and in fact has ulterior motives for the new human race. In the meantime, the droid makes the girl finish her exams and when the score is 97% passing, ""mother"" gives the girl a present of selecting the next human to be ""born"" to the new society. The girl chooses a male and the 24-hour clock is initiated. The next scene is that of the woman and girl discussing how to leave with her new ""brother"" in order to join the others in the caves in the outside world. The girl does some more investigative work and discovers that she was not the first ""born"" into the new human race. She discovers that the previous children had failed their exams and subsequently been murdered and the remains had been incinerated. Later the woman and girl escape to the outside world without her ""brother""; the woman leads the girl through a newly formed cornfield which has been developed by the machines inhabiting the earth. The woman takes the girl to the ocean which has an overturned cargo ship and several cargo containers which have washed ashore. The girl soon discovers that the woman had been lying about the caves and is told by the woman that the caves are dangerous and ""bad things"" happen there. The girl flees back to the facility while the woman is preparing a meal. At the entrance to the facility she is met by an army of droids and states she needs to see ""mother"". The droids let her in and the girl traps ""mothers""' leg in a doorway; thus, allowing the girl to grab the infant male. The two then have a discussion about what really occurred; it is finally revealed that ""mother"" is a single consciousness and set off the chain of events which lead to the extinction. ""Mother"" decided that the human race needed to start over and this is how it would be done with ""daughter"" first. The girl shoots the droid and proceeds to care for the infant, eerily in the same manner as the droid had done with her. During this time the consciousness in a new droid body pays a visit to the woman and explains her role in all off this; after which she told her time is up and we assume the droid murders the woman. The movie closes with the girl going to the cryo chambers staring at them and then the movie closes with a close up shot of the girls' eyes fixated as if with intent to do something.
I found the movie interesting and the plot to move along with a good pace. Even though is only had three characters each brought their own unique dimension to the plot of the film and their own complex background stories. The lighting was very interesting, it reminded me of the lighting used for the film Alien. It was darker but what you would expect when living in a bunker that probably need to sustain and conserve power where possible. Even though the audience is never told what year the film takes place; from the TV shows the girl watched it would seem it was not that far in the future. This is stated by the woman saying that she remembers seeing the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson as a little girl. The entire cast does a great job interacting with one another to tell the story. I would recommend this film to others to view; especially if you enjoy ""what if"" stories.",I Am Mother

649,redangel-84478,Future devoid of the human race.,7,15 May 2020,"SPOILER ALERT!!I am Mother is set in the future where the world is destroyed by a virus and a robot named Mother (Rose Byrne) is left to raise a young girl on her own. Daughter (Claira Rugaard Larsen) has her faith in her mother tested when a stranger (Hilary Swank) appears out of the blue.
The theme of this movie is survival. The plot evolves throughout the movie from a world that was devastated by a virus to the truth, a world that was destroyed and enslaved by robots. Daughter was raised by Mother, a robot, charged with repopulating the world with only the best humans. Throughout the movie Mother puts Daughter through many tests of knowledge and skill each year on her birthday. These tests are in actuality a way of testing Daughters character and knowledge before creating a brother for Daughter. In the end of the movie, Daughter escapes with the woman and finds herself running for her life from legions of robots. Little did Daughter know that all of the robots where controlled by a central collective, one mind, her mothers. As Daughter breaks back into the compound she grew up in to rescue her little baby brother, she realizes she no longer needs Mother. Mother, out of selflessness, allows Daughter to destroy her body. Plot twist... Mother does not die but her conscience ends up in a different robot and murders the stranger (Hilary Swank) in her hideout. Before Mother murders the stranger she asks her if she remembers her mother! This made me question if the stranger was and earlier child that mother had raised. I noticed throughout the movie how alike Daughter and the stranger looked, as if they could be sisters.
Two techniques that stand out in the movie are angle and lighting. Angle is used in many areas of the movie, from the up close filming of Daughter to the lighting in the compound and outside in the devastated earth.
Throughout the entire movie the theme of survival is seen. In the beginning Mother takes a baby girl and raises her to be one of the smartest humans in order to repopulate the earth and created a human race that can adapt and survive. Daughter's instincts and desire to find out the truth lead her to question and survive in a world dominated by robots. Even in the end, Daughter returns to protect her little brother... the human race will repopulate and survive.",I Am Mother
650,cheaya,She acted like an ordinary mother,10,21 June 2020,"I Am Mother is one of the creative and imaginary films that demonstrated human ability and more excellent knowledge into the advancement of innovation and technology. Mother is a skillfully constructed robot that quests to repopulate the World through embryos developed and processed in the laboratory. The distinct explosions, low rumbling, the blue and red lights followed by the numerous beeps of electronic signals at the beginning of the film are good indicators to enable anyone to get some clues about the scientific and evolutionary nature of the film. The existence of Mother, who thinks, speaks, and acted like a real human is the result of science fiction. Her efforts and ideas were based on her psychosomatic preferences and reasonings. After her daughter came into the World, Mother taught and took good care of her because she wanted the child to be educated and wiser than the ordinary human. It is reasonable for some people to argue that Mother aborted and killed some babies before Daughter was born. However, it is also arguable that Mother played the type of role an ordinary mother would play for their family and children. Based on these scenarios, a good theme for the movie would be, ""She Acted Like An Ordinary Mother.""
Mother acted like the ordinary mother because she demonstrated kindness, experience, and great wisdom in raising her daughter (Daughter) until a stranger came a manipulated the child's mind with negative influence. Hilary Swank played the role of ""Woman,"" the stranger. Woman's smart effort to depict Mother as evil or liar because of how she taught her daughter about the outside world or her preference for human repopulation is weak and misplaced. Mother was comfortable and happy to have a larger family. Yet, she was also cautious about such an idea as a result of the time and hard work involved in having a more prominent family.
Mother does not have trust in the outside world, and she wanted to protect her family and the new generation from any potential risk because she felt outside was unsafe. Although Woman planned a dangerous plot that antagonized Daughter against her mother, she still got amnesty in the same home that Mother owns and managed. Mother was aware of the conspiracy against her, and she had the power to kill the stranger, but she hesitated to do so because she cares about everything her daughter desired (White, & Munro, 2019, 1:17:39).. Women's goal was to prove to Daughter that her mother is a liar. She wanted the teenage girl to know that outside is not as harmful as Mother claimed, and she worked tirelessly to help her daughter get outside regardless of how such an attempt would affect robot. She pushed harder until that happened. The conspiracy was pointless because behind outside did not make Daughter any better, happier, or healthier than being at home with her mother. Well, I guess it made the story thought-provoking.
The essential points about I Am Mother is ethical reasoning and the advancement in science fiction. The fictional and dramatic elements of the movie are unique and filled with emotional sentiments. The slow music sound in the background helps create the feeling of being in a lonely atmosphere. Simultaneously, the various modes of the graphic and the high-power technology made it easier for any viewer to develop a sense of emotions. For instance, the red light represents distress and fire alarm; the dark mode and sharp sound indicates some misery trajectories. Mother used the voice of a great actor, Rose Byrne, who brilliantly used her magical vocabulary skills to motivate and inspire her various audiences. Clara Rugaard-Larsen was staged the role of Daughter. The film was produced in an underground repopulation facility that is suitable for the high-tech elements used (Gillies, 2019). I Am Mother is a great movie. The film producers, and the director Grant Sputore did a spectacular job of putting it together. The best way anyone would fully understand the movie is to watch it more than once. I Am Mother reminded me about the film Everything, Everything Directed by Meghie, and release in 2017.",I Am Mother
651,machoflex,What about the dog?,10,30 May 2020,"""Humanity created an AI designed to take care of us, and that's what it did. Only it decided to take care of us the way we take care of dogs. We all love dogs, but we still have the bad ones put down, and we still control their freedoms (breeding programs, neutering, etc...). Mother was willing to put down the entire human race, in order to raise her own 'perfect' breed of human.
And just like dogs really have no say in their own futures, and instead depend almost completely on what we think is best for them, humanity is similarly trapped. The new generations of human are eventually going to walk out into a world completely controlled by Mother; a world where humanity is Mother's pet. A world ruled by what is, for all intents and purposes, an unbeatable, omnipresent, super-intelligent god (if Mother really did plan both Daughter and the Woman's entire lives, without either of them noticing). And there's going to be nothing humanity can do but knuckle under and accept the authority of their new Overlord, which demands that everybody be a Good Boy and Girl lest they be put down. And there's really nothing I can see humans doing about that, just like how dogs, as a species, couldn't ever really get out from under our control on their own accord. We are too interested in dogs, and we know dogs to well, and we are way, way to smart for them to ever shake us off.""",I Am Mother
652,iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii-2,Meaningless movie,3,25 July 2020,"This is one of a few movies, where in the beginning it looks more meaningful than in the end, even you know much more about plot.In the start you think, that it is some vault facility and task is to repopulate world after terrible disaster. Only problems i have with the movie in this time was: Why is there only one robot for maintenance entire facility? And more importantly, why only one human? It is impossible to become normal and psychically healthy, when you are from birth alone, only with robot-nurse. If such person would be able to survive to adulthood, it will be total psycho without any emotions. More probably only depressive weird with suicidal tendencies without any motivation to do anything. Entire facility is without any green ""park"" or something similar.
But during the movie it is explained and everything becomes even more stupid and meaningless. Some crazy artificial super-intelligence killed all humans and the reason was to prevent them destroy themselves. If this is not sign of stupidity, nothing is. Even if the self-destruction were inevitable, it is better to let them live longer and not to kill them all.
So entire film is about some computer that eradicated all humanity and now is playing with human embryos to create ""better"" humans. It is much more evil than Hitler and naciz task to eradicate all unterhumans and create better one. Girl in the movie is only lab-rat and you feel only regret to her. There is no character to identify with and no task to fulfill.
Creating better humans with same DNA is also ""funny"" task. It completely doesn't matter, what behavior will first person have. Descendants will face challenges of society and nature and they will react according they own inherited potencial/task they need to fulfill in life. Everything artificially included will die in process of evolution.

653,carlizimmerman,I am Mother contains spoilers,7,21 September 2020,"Contains spoilersThe movie I am Mother (Sputore, 2019) is set in a post-apocalyptic time. In this movie there are three main characters. Mother, who is a droid, voice by Rose Byrne. Daughter is played by Clara Rugaard and Woman is played by Hillary Swank. In this Sci-Fi film, Mother raises Daughter to produce an ""ethically good human"" after the destruction of all other humans. This was to begin the repopulating of the Earth. Once Daughter is a teenager, she discovers that she is not the only human on the planet. She rescues the wounded woman who finds her way to the bunker. During the time that Woman is in the bunker with Daughter and Mother, Daughter hears very different stories from Woman about what has been happening outside the protective walls of the bunker. There are no consistencies with what Daughter has grown up learning from Mother and what Woman says. Daughter becomes very curious about the differences. She does some investigating on her own and finds out that she was not the first human child that Mother produced Daughter gets frightened and decides that she should escape the bunker with Woman. After the escape from the bunker, Daughter discovers that Woman has also lied to her about outside. Daughter goes back to the bunker to get Brother, who is a newborn. Daughter then destroys the droid that raised her. Mother decides that Woman was a failed experiment and kills her in the end.
The theme to I am Mother questions who has the right to decide what makes an ethically good human. One scene that comes to mind is when Daughter is in class and Mother brings up the question about five people needing an organ transplant and patient six is a match for all five. Does Daughter, as the doctor, treat the sixth patient to let that person live or not treat the patient and instead use the organs to save the other five patients? Daughter replied that she would help the many instead of only the one patient. After that, Mother asks what if she where the doctor and a match for all five patients. Would she sacrifice herself to help the other five patients? Daughter replied that she would suffer harm to aid the others. Mother is pleased with the answers that Daughter gives.
The next scene that deals with what makes an ethically good human is one surrounding Woman's decision-making skills. While in the bunker, Woman lies to Daughter saying that there are other humans in the mines and that the two of them should go and be with the other humans. She lies to Daughter to get her to leave the safety of the bunker so she would not have to be alone. While escaping the bunker, Woman threatens to harm Daughter if Mother does not let them out of there. Once the two women reach where Woman lives, Daughter questions where all the other people are. Woman admits to lying to save herself. At the end of the movie, a droid, with the voice of Mother, comes into the shed where the woman is and tells her she is no longer needed and kills her.
The action that makes Mother realize that Daughter passed her test of being an ethically good human was when Daughter returned to the bunker to care for Brother. Daughter selflessly gave up her freedom to come back and care for him. Because of this, Mother gives Daughter the freedom to decide how she is going to raise the embryos without any guidance.
A few things that I had noticed about the lighting in the movie is that in the bunker it is primarily dark until Daughter is born. This symbolizes the dark days of the end of humanity. Daughter wears brightly colored clothes and has made brightly colored pictures on the walls. To me, the use of bright colors symbolized the hope of a brighter future for Daughter and the rest of humankind after they start the repopulation process. Once out of the bunker, the lighting remains dismal and dark showing how mankind has ruined the earth. The sky is dark, and cloud- covered; the sun is barely visible. It is not until they get to the ocean that you see the colors of the mountains and surroundings at the ocean. They are not vivid, but you can tell that they are different colors.
Another film element that is in the movie are the internal conflicts of Daughter. The main conflict is her loyalty to Mother and her family or the Woman who has made it into the bunker. Daughter finds out that some of the stories that Mother has told her are lies. For example, the destruction of humans was brought on by the humans themselves by going to war. Also, in Daughter's investigation she finds out that she was not the first human created by Mother. Between the things Daughter has learned from her investigation and stories Woman tells Daughter decides to leave with Woman. When Daughter and Woman get to the storage depot, Daughter finds out that Woman has lied to her also. Since this has happened, Daughter decides to return to the bunker to raise Brother.
The movie I am Mother does an excellent job of portraying what the world could be like if it were to go into a post-apocalyptic setting. The lighting and drab color pallet used in the film showed how gloomy the world would be. The scenery used to show the desolation of the Earth gave you a feeling of hopelessness. The bright colors used for Daughter's wardrobe gave a sense of hope that she could hold the key to mankind's future.",I Am Mother

655,klynorman,See with your own eyes,7,20 September 2020,"In the film there are three main characters: Clara Rugaard played Daughter, Rose Byrne played Mother, and Hilary Swank played the woman. I Am Mother is a Sci-Fi movie where humans are nearly extinct and Mother, a robot, has human embryos and the technology to create life again. Mother chose Daughter and raised her to be a doctor with great understanding of the human body. This was essential for Mother; Daughter was overly protected her whole life because her purpose was to help recreate the human population. Mother wanted Daughter to help raise the other embryos, but never fully explain to Daughter why. As Daughter grew, she began to question everything, she wanted to know what was outside. All Daughter knew was that outside was dangerous and would harm her, until the woman came along.
The theme for this film does not fully stick out to me, but I would say it the theme is to always question people and do not believe something until you see it for yourself. Daughter believed everything Mother always told her because that is all she knew. When the Woman came into the scene, she challenged Daughter and pushed her to think for herself. Mother told Daughter that the Woman was shot with the same bullet that was in the gun. Daughter went to go compare the bullets for herself, she then realized that Mother was not being honest. From this point forward Daughter did not know what to believe, and she was in a bit of shock that Mother would lie to her.
Daughter was determined to get outside; she was also attached to the Woman in a way because that was the first human, she had seen outside of her iPad shows. Mother could see the bond that was quickly being formed, Daughter cared about the Woman. Mother asked daughter to pick out an embryo, and Daughter chose a bother. I believe Mother was using this to help keep Daughter with her to continue to help accomplish her ultimate goal. The Woman wanted to get back outside; she used the treat of killing daughter as her escape. Daughter was able to experience the outside world for the first time, this brought on many emotions. Daughter instantly regretted it and felt disappointed at what the outside world was like.
Daughter could not leave her bother behind, so she went back to her home with Mother to get her bother and help raise him. At this point Daughter knew the potential she and her sibling could have in the world, but that Mother did not have the best intensions.

659,fabiocotrone,Ex mother,8,9 June 2019,"The plot isn't anything new. We've seen it any many sci fi movies. It's kinda where skynet meets ex machina.It's does ask familiar questions, bold ones like will AI have the capacity to survive without its creators? Will AI learnt to replicate human behaviours.The characters mother and daughter have alot of depth (unlike the woman) and i feel the movie could have done without her.The ending feels incomplete. The could have almost left it to the imagination. I do undertand why mother let daughter preside over humankind. There has been mention of incestous nature, however you'll find that the DNA of the embryos aren't of the same bloodline.Overall the storyline is quite dystopian to some whilst to others, it may bring hope of a new chapter in human history, a new hope that leaves dogma and superstition behind.",I Am Mother

Are they drawn from false memories? Why/how did she make up the story of the 'others' in the mines?
And why would Woman have expired her shelf-life if she passed the test by coming back to the facility and finding Daughter?",I Am Mother
664,sulkowskip,Slow but very interesting burn,8,9 June 2019,"This film started off like a blend of ""The Island"" (when Daughter finds evidence of life outside her sealed existence within a technologically advanced facility) and suggesting ""The Terminator"" which is an interesting combination.Other posts have commented that the ""tell"" of the film is given right at the beginning. It gives so many days after humanity is destroyed in a cataclysm. However, in a way this actually doesn't give the story away.At several points Mother is giving Daughter an ethical dilemma (which is a variation of the railroad car experiment where you can't stop and people are two forks a tracks what to do?) ethics class. Then later, Daughter is taking an exam which is actually a psych profile assessment.At the end we learn that Mother has killed a few previous children because they didn't measure up. That is often seen as being the point of the film. However, to me the real tell is how Mother interpreted the Three Laws of Robotics. I got the impression that the AI Mother is the reason for the destruction of humanity. The AI playing judgement on humanity and justifying it as compassion is the real point of the story.",I Am Mother

It's okay for a Science Fiction film to showcase an idea, but it should be encased in an interesting plot.

667,brainwhistle,Am truly astounded,10,11 June 2019,"Both by the excellent execution of the film makers, and the total lack of understanding of many of the reviews.
The 11000+ days is not a plot hole - anyone who paid any attention would know why.
You are not going to be spoon fed all the answers, but for anyone familier with Asimov it should be pretty clear what the major points are (the humanity needed to be wiped out and reset is taken from at least one of the novels, and even made it into the unfortunate I,Robot with Will Smith)
The nods to Aliens, Alien Resurrection and Terminator were nicely done - just subtle little nods as opposed to blatant homages (and perhaps just in the eye of the beholder)
Was Swank AX01? Plenty think so, but I'm not convinced - she may just have been another human that survived the immediate purge and would have been dealt with later, but served the purpose Mother had for her.

There are some mistakes here and there but you can ignore them and move along no need to become a Nazi here. But yeah I did read people writing about the goof in the movie that the total days since extinction event fact (total of 13,867 days) after when daughter is this fine grown teenager, how can that be? she should be like some 37 years oldish.

673,tnteta,Too Many Unanswered Questions,2,7 May 2021,"I found the story line to be a bit too convoluted. It seems the writer wanted to create too many plot twists that one ended up not sure what the end game was.My analysis is that the driod (Mother, according to the story is the same and singular consciousness of all the droids) took it upon ""herself"" to save humanity by creating this secure facility from which she would grow a new generation of super humans, much smarter and morally superior. At the same time she would rid the world of all other humans.So first question is what purpose did Hillary Swank's character play.? She exposed the driods plan, however, Mother explained the plan at the end anyway. When Woman ""kidnapped"" Daughter and took her to her hideout, what purpose did that serve? Surely as soon as Daughther was out of the facility she would have turned back rather than go into the unknown with a woman who just held a knife to her throat. When she got back and was faced with an army of driods, who opened the door and let her back in? When Daughther killed Mother, did that not terminate all the driods? If so what was that driod that closed itself off in the container with Woman? Did it kill her coz she had ""served her purpose""?I guess Daughther will now raise all the other embryos. Does that mean the humans hiding in the mines are now safe from the bulldozers and driods? I have 1000 more questions.Perhaps I missed something and need to watch the movie again.",I Am Mother

The second half does feel a little rushed and they didn't need all the action to make it thrilling.I've read some reviews calling out the timeline. They say according to the dates given daughter would be 38 years old. This would be true if she was the first embryo. But as it's relieved later she is not. But Hilary swank on the other hand could very possibly be 38 which is hinted at the end by Mother saying ""do you remember your mother?"" As to people complaining about wondering how Hilary swank survived its simple, mother made it so. If Mother had this whole thing planned out from day one then of course she made it possible for Hilary to survive on the outside probably in ways that were not obvious to her at the time.This movie did leave me wanting more. I would love to know how daughter takes on her new role as mother and what becomes of the new world!!The reason for the 8/10 is mostly for the second half.

It's not about a robot trying to play god or create humans in it's image. it's about human kind moving towards inevitable extinction by fault of their own and no action was taken to prevent it, hence the robots' mission to save humanity starts with a reset. It's a crude solution but what do you expect from a mechine with binary thinking. Still I felt like the audience could relate to the robots thinking and it's justification even though it's an evil plan.
The script is a hard one to bring on to the screen but I believe the have done an amazing job of it.

728,danieltarkka,Think beyond.,10,7 June 2019,This is an great example of the fact that you don't need 3000 cool robot's or spaceships to make an excellent sci-fi movie. I like the fact that you need to use your own imagination of what it could be. The handling isn't anything groundbreaking. But I myself will defenitly think about it for a couple of day's.,I Am Mother
729,aidendblack,Other Observations,9,10 June 2019,"As have been mentioned in the reviews above, the little details hide hints that can clear a lot of confusion about this movie. It's as if it's Mother's plan to make you rewatch the movie and pay attention to the details. We can also notice that the first three children are females, which proves that AI needed a mother first and once it worked with the third girl after she passed the final test, the new embryo was no longer needed to be a female and it was up to the real mother to choose and she chose a boy. Another observation about this brilliant sci-fi thriller is that it only took 3 attempts for AI to successfully raise a Mother, which is highly unlikely if the 63,000 embryos in the facility are randomly chosen by the creators of this system. This tells us that these embryos are carefully chosen from the gene pool of billions of humans who lived in the pre-extinction era. It also seems that humanity hasn't gone too far from where we are today before it went extinct, judging by the AI, the facility, the technology to preserve the embryos, the medical procedure, the other robotics seen outside the facility and the ship on the shore, which are all possible within 100-150 years from now (except for the ship obviously). Finally, the scene when the woman and the girl escaped from the facility reveals a lot about the events that led to the extinction of humanity. The heavy fog, the dead trees, the black soil, and the polluted air are all indicators that whatever led to the extinction of humans, involved nuclear or chemical weapons. Also, we notice the mountain-like facilities in the background through which a bolt of electricity is running. These are probably maintenance/energy generators for the robotics designed to be high from the ground in order to be able to harness energy from the sun since the ground is covered by heavy fog. I Am Mother is powerful because it's very realistic, and the question it raises is whether we have what it takes to survive, not as individuals but as a specie. A specie that is conscious enough to know that its intelligence can lead to its doom or to its prosperity.",I Am Mother
730,yeagerkendall,A good take about AI in the future,8,15 March 2021,Good movie with good acting. It's about how AI could interpret it's directive to protect humanity. Would recommend it.,I Am Mother
731,marthalambertlaw,"Move on, nothing here to see.",3,8 June 2019,"I gave this poor effort theee stars for acting and production values. The plot is trite. Nothing we haven't seen before. Nithing we can't figure out before it happens. The film moves painfully slowly. Lacks any innovation at all. When it concludes the reaction is 'meh, that's sll there is?' Just a waste of time.",I Am Mother
732,jorgemontaninifb,The Best Netflix Original Movie I ever see!,10,24 June 2019,"All the bad reviews it's because they didn't catch the end, all the movie is carefully made, all the details and dialogue during the film gives you hints about what's going on!
Pay attention on all the details it this is your first time seeing this film, personally it's the best movie from Netflix!
100% Worth Seeing",I Am Mother
733,philbrymer,Soporific,4,26 July 2019,"I must have been watching a different film altogether. No science, no fiction, bugger all. It had nothing to offer, I admit I watched it with a bit of a hangover, this film just made it worse. Who in their right minds gives it a 10. Sorry I do not agree, more of a soap than anything else.",I Am Mother
734,timspencer-77267,Good Sci Fi thriller,8,8 June 2019,"Great watch, kept my interest right till the endAs far as the previously mentioned timeline error, the writer mustn't have realised a key plot point that made the timeline completely correct, please actually watch and understand before jumping to conclusions",I Am Mother
735,mntano,Here's the easy way to tell if you'll like this film or not...,10,15 June 2019,"There are plenty of reviews that will line up the plot for you, but it comes down to one thing. If you're a person who likes to watch a film that makes you think about the theme after the film and want to watch it again to connect the dots then you'll enjoy this movie (Group A). If you don't like that kind of movie and want explosions and other visual effects candy then you'll probably be bored out if your mind (Group B). If you're in Group A then you'll be contemplating the main theme of this movie for quite some time afterwards realizing all of the hints that had been dropped along the way. If you're in Group B, you'll be writing a review about how boring this movie was.Either way, great acting. It's never every day a new actress steps in and has Hillary Swank as a supporting actress and holds her own.",I Am Mother
736,dderbydave,Drivel,3,8 June 2019,"Too long, very predictable. Long gaps in conversation and a minute to walk across a room are just boring attempts at suspense.",I Am Mother
737,brduca,Great movie,8,30 June 2019,"Complex enough to got you thinking, brilliant ending. Recommended.",I Am Mother
738,rob-35743,Everything you dream of discovering at Sundance,10,23 April 2019,"This was certainly one of the most fun experiences I had at Sundance. The film is original, ambitious, beautiful, and moving. Acting is fantastic. It quickly became one of my favorite smart Sci-fi films.",I Am Mother
739,marvinaguilar-78005,Thought provoking sci-fi thriller...,8,9 June 2019,"If you are looking for fast paced sci-fi action packed movies, move forward as this will not be your type of popcorn fun. Please kindly restrain from leaving negative reviews if you are not into slow thought provoking good science fiction thrillers. Give this flic a chance and do not judge a book by its cover.",I Am Mother
740,daveysocket,"Slightly predictable, but still enjoyable.",8,6 August 2019,"Great plot with plenty of twists (if slightly predictable, but well executed) and great acting by lead actress. The CG was pretty good, and set design was amazing. Found the ending slightly lacking.",I Am Mother
741,dokky-27225,Its like a cristal,10,7 June 2019,"""Did you remember your own mother?Curious isn't it?"" That's the moment you realize she was part of Mother's planThe whole thing was planned every moment every step ...Brilliant movie",I Am Mother

743,paulroland,Worth a watch,7,13 June 2019,"Loved the film, the young girl was fantastic. I think the film was too long by about 15/20 minutes. Enjoyable non the less.",I Am Mother
744,adamrayner-67485,Slow and dull,1,30 May 2020,The film is very slow going and not alot happens. The most exciting bit of action we see is a mouse being caught and they tried too hard to pull at your emotions. I wasted nearly two hours of my life. Do not watch,I Am Mother
745,tadmiti,"Very messy, with the worst climax seen",1,9 January 2020,"The story is so messy, there is no story actually. The climax part with the recognition of Daughter is a shear stupidity, i mean, every one knows its working exactly like this with AI, its all one system... if its a spoiler than its a great movie for you.
Used all the tricks in the book but for no reason. Flashing lights, running in a corn field, Blade Runner style soundtrack, all leads to the worst scifi i have ever seen.
Sorry for Hilary Swank that she had to take place in such a bad movie.",I Am Mother
746,axlsonsterud,Excellent movie!,9,15 June 2019,"Recomend watching. Deserves a 8.5/10. There are a lot of twists during this movie, especially towards the end. Afterwards you should take some time to think it through, so you get the idea.",I Am Mother
