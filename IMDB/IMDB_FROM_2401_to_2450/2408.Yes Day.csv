0,SnoopyStyle,forced family fun,5,18 March 2021,"Free spirit Allison (Jennifer Garner) marries soulmate Carlos Torres (Edgar Ramírez) and they have three kids. Somewhere along the way, she becomes an over-protective mom. Her kids are not happy with her controlling ways. The school counsellor suggests giving the kids a Yes Day, a day when Allison says yes to her kids' every wish... within reason.It's not the worst premise in the world especially for a family film. Garner can do the hyper mommy type. She's also trying to tap into 13 Going on 30 but it's a bit more forced when it's 15 Going on 50. Now, most of this movie is random forced fun and that's not that much fun. It's definitely juvenile and I guess that's the point. The movie finally gets somewhere with the parents in jail. The last act is more compelling but that's not saying much. It's a safe evening for the family to watch together and that's worth something.",Yes Day
1,nogodnomasters,Kids changed my life.,6,15 March 2021,"Allison (Jennifer Garner ) and Torres (Edgar Ramírez) were very active people who said ""Yes"" to all kinds of adventures. And then children happened as ""NO"" became the new ""Yes."" Once it is pointed out how strict they are as parents, they decide to have a ""yes day"" for their kids with fun and heart warming results.Good film for family night.",Yes Day
2,classicsoncall,"""You should say 'yes' to a Yes Day"".",4,21 March 2021,"Rating the film higher than I did would be a disservice to all the other pictures I've reviewed and rated, but if you're a young family with kids, it's not the worst thing in the world to watch together as a unit. I see a similar sentiment expressed by others on this board, so I don't think I'm being too critical. There's a lot of buffoonery and silliness going on in the story, pretty much to be expected given the premise of the film, to allow the kids in the family an opportunity to have all their fun requests allowed under the guise of a 'yes day' where anything goes within reason. I thought the 'windows open car wash' a stretch even for the most permissive of parents but what the heck, it's only a movie. A feel good moment occurs in the final segment when Mom (Jennifer Garner) finds her daughter (Jenna Ortega) at an amusement park concert she wasn't allowed to attend with her friends unsupervised, and it makes for the picture's message of families staying together by playing together. At just under an hour and a half, this could be one of your 'yes day' activities.",Yes Day
3,Edvis-1997,5,5,12 March 2021,"It's not bad movie but it's not for me. I found plot very clique and when you can guess what's going to happend in entire movie what's the point to watch it? Talking about acting, parents did decent job but kids, well, let's say they've tried. Plot didn't make lot of sense. If kids can do everything they want, they would love to eat junk food,go to cinema, play video games, go to theme parks. But,somehow, these kids decided to do pointless things. It didn't convince me at all. Some scenes were pushed to the limit to show how cute and adorable family is and I don't like that extra sugar. I wouldn't recommend to watch this movie for people without kids, if you have them, yeah, give it a go, maybe they'll like it.",Yes Day
4,cruise01,"Yes Man movie for kids which has jokes, humor, and only aiming for a certain audience",3,15 March 2021,"1.5 out of 5 stars.Yes Day is a pretty bad family comedy film which has a similiar idea to Jim Carreys Yes Man movie which is more entertaining than this. Yes Day aims for the younger audiences with its dumb, quirky jokes, and eh acting with the cast ensemble. Not really much is delivered with this film.What worked? The concept idea is a missed opportunity which could have been so much more. Yes Day is similiar to Yes Man. Which this time. Kids call the shots with there parents and parents have to say yes. Which only leads to disaster.What did not work with the film?The plot is dumb. Its about parents who once was adventurous. But now they are strict with there kids. Edgar Ramirez is the fun father. Jennifer Garner is the bad guy parent. When they give there three kids a yes day to make the plans and they say yes. It can only lead to mayhem.The cast ensemble performances are terrible. Jennifer Garner and Edgard Ramirez are great but there performances are shadowed by bad acting. Along with Jenna Ortega.The script is filled with atrocious dialogue. Bad jokes and dumb silly humor which kids would love. But adults may find it boring.The direction is cliche. Evantually there is conflict with the parents and there kids. Which they separate and things get out of hand.I will say this is one of the worst films this year.",Yes Day
5,lisafordeay,I found it hilarious. Love Jennifer Garner,7,12 March 2021,"Yes Day is a 2021 family comedy starring Jennifer Garner,Jenna Ortega and Edgar Ramirez. From the director of Alexander and The Horrible, Terrible,No Good Very Bad Day the story is about the Torres family who have to say yes to everything for 24 hours. With some hilarious consequences will it last?.What drew me to this film was Jennifer Garner as I watch anything with her in it. I've always loved her spunky childlike personality and she comes across as a very down to earth woman. 13 Going On 30 is probably my favourite movie off her resume. If you loved Yes Man(the one with Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel) or even Alexander And The No Good Very Bad Day then you will like this movie. It also marks Jennifer Garner's Netflix debut. Did I forget to mention that she actually sings in this film near the end of the film. Singer H.E.R makes a cameo.Will definitely watch it again.",Yes Day
6,DarkVulcan29,Pretty entertaining family film,8,21 March 2021,"Very strick parents(Jennifer Garner and Edgar Ramirez) feel they are looked by there kids, cause they seem to lack any feeling to have fun. So decide to have a yes day, to let there kids to decide what fun stuff they can do, but will they make it through the day?
A family for all to enjoy, it's very funny, and tells stuff about about being a parent and dealing with our kids growing up. The only real problem is Jennifer Garner and Edgar Ramirez has a couple, they just had trouble selling me there a couple, some parts they where good, other parts not so much. But they where still good anyway, so where the kids.",Yes Day

8,kwenchow,"Another worst film! Full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Avoid at all cost!",1,18 March 2021,"This film start with the narrator talking about Carlos, and the introduction of the Torres family scene! As turnout, this film is about Torres family need to spend the so called ""Yes Day"" together one day! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the driving scene, overuse of the singing scene, overuse of the eating scene, overuse of the drinking scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the calling names scene, overuse of the partying scene, overuse of the playing with foam scene, overuse of the shouting scene, and overuse of the arguing scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Allison, and Carlos fighting with a woman to win the gorilla doll! At the end, after cleaning the foam, the foam still flooding the outside house of Carlos! Still have a post credit scene! The referee been throwing things by the contestant! That's it! Another disappointed film!",Yes Day
9,r96sk,Rather unoriginal,5,12 March 2021,"Rather unoriginal, though the cast make it more likeable than it would otherwise be.'Yes Day' is exactly what it says on the tin, you will not be shocked to find out what the plot is. It plays out in the most predictable way possible, even the hearty moments are a little too sickly at times. With that said, there are some minor decent bits.Jennifer Garner (Allison) and Édgar Ramírez (Carlos) work well enough together, though Garner definitely stands out more. Jenna Ortega (Katie) does alright in her role, one that isn't too dissimilar to Isabela Merced's in 'Instant Family' - as is the whole film, in actual fact. 'Yes Man', ft. Jim Carrey, also holds slight similarities as you might expect. Both those films are far better, fwiw.Not one I'll be revisiting, but I could see families in particular having a fine time with this. Each to their own, of course.",Yes Day
10,ks-60500,Naught kids,4,11 April 2021,Kids fantasy transformed in a movie and I don't against the concept for relaxing once a while. But literally kids have judgement on what's right or can do? Really no! This movie tried to tell even a yes day could be a nightmare. I can't take it even when watch they behave in the movie.,Yes Day
11,questl-18592,No Day,5,3 May 2021,"Super generic family comedy is super generic. Couple decent performances offset by some massive logic leaps I just wasn't willing to make. Don't let your kids watch this, it will give them way too many awful ideas. As an aside though? I love that this was a mixed heritage household and they never once made a thing out of it. Garner is obviously a white woman and she's married to a (what's the appropriate parlance these days? Is it latino? Latin? LatinX? My apologies if I get it wrong) Latin American man who speaks Spanish and English during the movie. In so many other movies they would've done a whole thing about that and I kind've love that this wasn't even mentioned, it just was what it was and that's awesome. Movie is still super generic but I dig that.",Yes Day
12,Abdulxoxo,A harmless cute family movie,7,12 August 2021,"Yes day is a comedy family drama that shows what it will be like if parents were to allow their kids to have a day where they can't say no anything they ask, well of course there are some exception. This film looks nice, especially the suitably picturesque location work and the photography is never too drab or garish. The acting performance was pretty good; Jennifer Gardner was clearly having fun with her role as a strict yet lively mother of not one but three kids. Edgar Ramirez was also good as the passive yet loving father. The three Young actors also played their part well. The mother-daughter dynamic was the main conflict, and although it was unoriginal it played really well and helped maintain the film's emotional level. Furthermore, while the script is not always sharp enough and has moments where it is forced much of it is highly amusing and smart. It also didn't seem as cheesy or as sappy, or at least it didn't go too far on them, as other family drama films. Although the story is admittedly very predictable and has a lot of cliches, both deliberate choices with both being two things that the film is poking fun at, it for the last two acts is full of energy and charm.",Yes Day
13,saadgkhan,"Fun premise, terrible execution",4,13 March 2021,"Yes Day - C+ (Flawed but Worthy)Instead of heartfelt realistic execution, the director went all Tiffany Haddish or Melissa McCarthy (in her husband's movies) on the idea. Unrealistic, loud and screaming or should I say screeching kids.Jennifer Garner was the only one kept me watching this till the end. She tried her best but the rest of the cast has no energy or charm to match her.The girl playing the eldest kid, Jenna Ortega's agent must be working extra hard getting her all The most Annoying Teen parts on Netflix. First in YOU season 2, then Babysitter 2 and now Yes Day. Playing same irritating hyped up kid who is too smart and grownup for her age etc etc. we get it, you got angst.Can't believe that a movie about hour and half can get soo tedious. Kids may enjoy but parents have to suffer.",Yes Day
14,btreakle,Family movie,7,26 March 2021,Typical family movie with family values and lessons of life. Definitely worth the watch with younger children.,Yes Day
15,MuviFan73,It was kind of nice.,6,13 March 2021,"Had my hopes really up & I was looking forward to it as it came from a real writer. The thing is its whats the word nice would describe.Targeting mother by her kids and turning it into a yes day story for me was not at all cool. Yes, yes day is a real thing. Googled it!Most of the fun events fail to connect with the audience. One of the obvious exceptions, the part containing the nerd nature.",Yes Day
16,Sir_AmirSyarif,Good-natured and generally likeable family fare,5,16 March 2021,"Good-natured and generally likeable, Miguel Arteta's 'Yes Day' is a harmlessly bland family fare that's competent enough to be watchable, but destined to be forgotten as soon as you're done with it. It's got its moments of humor, but it's not funny enough. It flirts with cleverness, but it's nowhere close to being clever enough. Fortunately, the cast is good enough and that helps overcome a lot of the movie's flaws. The whole cast - kids included - is wonderful here.",Yes Day
17,Movi3DO,Just Stupid and Harmfully Unrealistic,2,15 March 2021,"Umm no way Yes Day in this Asian household. Two parents made a yes day, where for 24 hours they say Yes to everything (most of them) their three kids asked and created.The movie was supposed to be ridiculous but fun for the family. However, I think this would be for sure fun for the kids but not the parents.At the beginning the movie was actually pretty fun and enjoyable. There were things that were questionable in logic, but I was willing to ignore because the movie was for kids. However, about the second half, this movie let go of logic and turned into an unfunny and just stupid mess. I just could not smile or chuckle at the dumb stuff and void of logic that I felt could be harmful without parental guidance.The most annoying part of the movie was that it showed how the Yes Day turned into an ugly mess, but somehow the movie wanted to tell the kids that Yes Day is supposed to be good. I'm sorry but the parents got into jail at a point.I don't like to get mad at a movie, but this one was just not it. 2.5/10",Yes Day
18,legobuilderpro,No day,4,13 March 2021,"The reason I didn't rate it lower was because I can see other people liking this.But I know this isn't the movie for meThe kids were annoying, bratty demons and the first like 20 seconds was hard to watch, I was more on the mom and dad's side mostly through it.",Yes Day
19,raybennetthays,Heartwarming family fun,10,13 April 2021,"It's got lots of heart, lots of laughs, lots of character development, and lots of good acting, how many times does a movie have a scene where people go through a car wash with the windows down? I love this movie, it's great.",Yes Day

21,trinaboice,Family-friendly fun,9,12 March 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
I love the idea of a Yes Day! Parenting is full of ""no's"", so it's important to show our kids that we can be fun and spontaneous too. The family-friendly film is based on the book Yes Day! by Amy Krouse Rosenthal.It's not going to win any film awards, but it's a charming movie your whole family will get a kick out of, especially if you have young kids. It's sure to spark some conversations and ideas about what your own family can do to get out of a rut and have some fun together.THINGS I LIKED:
I adore Jennifer Garner. She's so gorgeous and just doggone charming. I'll basically watch any movie she's in because I love her that much. In this movie, she actually sings! Well, I'm pretty sure that's her real voice and not someone else's dubbed in. This is her first Netflix movie, but she has another one coming soon called ""The Adam Project"" with Ryan Reynolds and Mark Ruffalo. Yay! Director Miguel Arteta also worked with Jennifer Garner in Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day (Theatrical)
Edgar Ramirez makes a handsome husband for Jennifer Garner's character. They had a chemistry that was very sweet.
Fans of H.E.R. will be thrilled to watch her perform at the end of the movie.
The film features a family that sometimes speaks Spanish to each other. I thought it was really sweet that Jennifer Garner's character (the mom) isn't Latina but has made the effort to learn the language so her kids can appreciate and honor their cultural heritage.
The activities the kids choose are pretty creative. Speaking of the kids, all three of the child actors are pretty doggone cute. Jenna Ortega brings a fanbase with her, and Julian Lerner and Everly Carganilla are super cute.
Nat Faxon provides some random humor with his quirky character.
Wow, I was super impressed when the parents agreed to drive through a car wash with the windows rolled down! I used to fantasize about what that would be like when I was a little girl. I suppose it's a lot easier to say yes to that if your car is a piece of junk!
I was impressed that so many kids stuck around after the party to help clean up. That rarely happens!
It's lighthearted and fun. You'll definitely catch yourself smiling and laughing.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
I don't understand why parents think it's so horrible to look at their kids' phones. The parents are the ones who bought the phone in the first place. Every now and then, I would do an unscheduled phone check on my kids' phones when they were younger. They knew it could happen at any time, so they kept their communication clean and appropriate. As a parent, it was very educational and always provided fodder for deeper conversations with my kids. Yes, I understand the importance of respecting each other's privacy, but parents don't have the luxury of being naive when it comes to their kids' cell phone activity.
Some of the situations and dialogue are super corny and cheesy.
Some sequences lasted too long.
I usually get a kick out of Fortune Feimster in movies, but the humor in her scenes just didn't land for me.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Some Spanish is spoken, sometimes with subtitles and sometimes without
No profanity
Talk about having a ""Yes Day"" with your own kids! As the movie showed, you'll definitely want to set some ground rules before the day starts though!
Also, talk to your kids about the bad behavior illustrated in the movie and why it's not acceptable.
Head's up for parents who don't know: ""Fleek"" means extremely good, attractive, or stylishYou can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Yes Day
22,gab-67599,Fam movie,10,13 March 2021,"Cute, funny and definitely a great family movie. One that makes you feel good at the end. Feel good movie :)",Yes Day
23,Just-A-Girl-14,NO!,6,12 April 2021,I thought the idea was good and I liked the beginning of the movie but it got lame really fast. I don't understand why movies show kids doing stuff no normal kid would ever do. If you decide to give your kids a yes day it shouldn't be a contest of trying to force you parents to say no. It should be a fun day for the kids in which you do fun things that the kids want and let go of the rules a little bit. It shouldn't be about being cool. Why do everyone have to be cool nowadays? It's not a popularity contest. Parents should be good not cool! The whole movie was forced and annoying. Definitely not funny. Horrible example for children and a really missed opportunity for a fun family film.,Yes Day
24,waqassaleem-85201,Family friendly,6,2 July 2021,An incredibly fun film for the entire family. Teaches a good lesson towards the end of the film. Definitely worth a watch.,Yes Day
25,jakethesnake-42007,It's a great family film,5,18 April 2021,First off it's a family film and he's aimed at families and kids. I don't have kids and I'm 34 but I found it a cute film yes it's annoying but it's a family film.,Yes Day
26,faer_kr,Nice try,5,14 March 2021,"A generic family comedy.
It is about a family that adopts to live one day to all Yes to look cool and try to connect with their children, after they are classified as dictators.
Quality.
Entertaining
Crazy.
Jennifer Garner being the same character as always.
Incongruent nonsense.
Light jokes and sarcasm, sitcom and flatulence.
With many nonsensical moments, such as where they take out their clothes to change if they do not have anything in their hands or how they steal things from the school.
A good message raised but poorly developed and the worst thing is that the whole idea left at the end.
They try to talk about how difficult it is to be a father and raise children, about being a son and how unfair parents are, but that premise is never balanced in an hour and a half of the movie, they only brush strokes without closing.
Sunday to disconnect the brain.",Yes Day
27,Mcduff3601,A wonderful reprieve from watching Frozen 2 for the 1000th time,10,2 May 2021,"This movie was awesome! It had real life people that talked to each other, there were NO animated characters or songs or super heros or super villians.This movie was about a family going about their day to day lives and realizing they needed to spice things up with a YES day where the parents have to do (within reason) what the kids want.I genuinely found the movie to be charming and less painful that some of the other reviewers found it. I can totally see if I didn't have kids this movie would not have been for me.But it was an amazing movie for me that didn't have Pepa Pig being a spoiled brat. I didn't have to sit through another round of inane dialogue between Ryder and the Paw Patrol... I mean WHY IS A KID in charge of emergency services for Adventure Bay... does this make sense... I FEEL LIKE I AM TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!!!I would recommend this movie to any family that is looking to change things up with a movie they haven't watched before. It's not the greatest movie you will every watch but it isn't Cars 3 on the 934th viewing either.",Yes Day
28,joeyford-55342,Fun popcorn flick,8,21 March 2021,Kid movie but we liked it. Funny and light hearted. Worth the look,Yes Day
29,zac-04879,Stupid Family Fun,8,14 June 2021,"This is honestly just an excellent family comedy all about dumb fun, silly humour, and a huge mix of terrific ideas. Due to these childish elements, Yes Day is... unexpectedly fun. Although young children will find it all hilarious family fun, which it is, teens and adults will likely engage with the more responsible perspective of the parents. Anyway, spend some time to relax with your family and pick this light, entertaining slapstick comedy.For everyone, this Netflix comedy presents several handfuls of positive family messages. The foolish humour it provides is mainly positioned for young children and undeniably gives the impression of being simple stupidness, which it is, but it's actually fairly fun to witness. The crazy mess is just a pleasure for a family movie night, although the kids get a little irritating at times and it isn't too satisfying.The crazy mess is fun, but it'll leave you feeling unsatisfied after the credits have rolled. Therefore, it's completely effortless to understand how many teens and grown ups will find this movie a load of stupidity. The silly material and rude, babylike humour is constant.In Yes Day, there's two perspectives to view it from: ""This family comedy is childish and completely stupid"", or ""This family comedy is childish but honestly fun"". What mainly makes Yes Day an awesome family-friendly comedy, is how surprisingly entertaining the film is. There's plenty of good laughs and fun feelings to hold you through it.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Yes Day

34,koofasa,I live Jennifer Garner but...,2,21 March 2021,"Don't you love it when school teachers tell parents how to raise their children? When a couple of teachers tell a set of parents that their children are complaining that their parents are strict, the teachers convince the parents to change how they parent their kids. This is one more case of the establishment diminishing the importance of parenting. Perhaps this is why our millennials are still living at home now that they are nearing middle age. A few too many yes days. Just say no, grow up, get a job and be an adult. Does anyone else remember their parents telling them that the reason they say know no is because they love them. I recall hearing 'If I didn't love you so much..."" and it always ended with a no. I ended up having a ton of respect for parents because they didn't do the easy thing but always made sure that I knew they loved me.",Yes Day
35,LiveLoveLead,Go into this knowing it's meant for kids...,6,21 March 2021,"This is a silly, cheesy, predictable, family-friendly film... When parents who have forgotten how to let loose and enjoy life decide to give their frustrated kids a ""Yes Day""...well you can imagine the crazy that ensues. Jennifer Garner is fun and energetic. Edgar Ramírez is sweet. The acting/script goes a smidge overboard and manic at times, and the kids are a bit ornery, but that's the point. The Yes Day events planned by the kids are pretty tame for the most part. There are some morals taught, that could have presented a bit better for sure... but if you want something corny and fun for the family (mostly 10-years and younger) to enjoy, grab some popcorn, build a fort, or pitch a tent in the living room and enjoy. As an empty nester, it was still enjoyable enough, IMHO!

36,stermix501,"some 1 review users, rated 1....",7,14 March 2021,"...and without reasoning entitled it ""Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen"".
Everybody knows what is the target audience of any movie. So if you watched a family movie while what you wanted was a horror one, then don't blame the movie. And if you blame it, explain why. Unless you are a morron watching whatever the streaming platform brings you without choosing, which is also impossible, because platform's A.I. wouldn't be so silly to propose something you wouldn't like. So, anyone giving this 1 star have something wrong.To the movie now, it's a cute family movie, some family issues, some family jokes (without the gross ones seen in Vacation movies), and some white thread plot. Nothing new, nothing bad either. I personnaly found it fine",Yes Day
37,Doublej20005,A Mediocre Comedy,5,2 April 2021,"Not a terrible comedy - the performances are fine, some of the situational comedy is enjoyable, the police officer dude is really funny and the less than 90 minutes runtime keeps the film at least fairly entertaining - yet it never really amounts to anything besides a bland and ultimately forgettable family comedy. The only real laughs come from the police officer, who basically saves the second half of the film - except for that it's only a couple of light chuckles at best. The plot is predictable, the ending is lazy and the script is ultimately nothing noteworthy. There's definitely a lot of potential for a film with a silly concept like this to be really entertaining, but it just never got to that level, and I was left underwhelmed overall. It's not offensively bad - it's just a mediocre film.",Yes Day

39,daisyisabaker,Misleading Trailer,2,18 March 2021,"Predicable, crazy, messy.
I watched it the whole way through waiting to see which scene the song ""Good Time"" would show up on... but nope. It isn't even featured in the film at all.. Where was Carly Rae Jepsen or Owl City?!?The whole point in the premise is that they have ground rules about what they do:
-has to be legal
-has to be fun
-cant be overly expensive
-has to be fulfilled within that day (can't adopt a dog cus that obviously is a long-lasting thing)
-has to be local
-have to say YES to all challengesyet each character says No multiple times, they break the law by joyriding in an ambulance and giving them a lift to an amusement park which is really far away.
All of the ground rules get literally thrown out of the window and they end up destroying their house (which they clearly can't just fix in only 1 day.)
Special Cringe mention to the singer H.E.R.They mention her every 5 mins throughout the film.. literaly celebrity version of product placement and in the finale scene, she makes an appearance...
It's so forced and obviously none of the cast actually know any of her songs cus they try to ""song along"" by mouthing the words that they clearly dont know. 😬
(I'm surprised that her songs weren't being played throughout the trailer)The only decent scene is when they play Capture The Flag with Kool-Aid filled water balloons.Jennifer Garner's back must be broken cus she literally carried the whole film. Even though her Spanish accent was really bad",Yes Day
40,GavWaskett,Yes Day or 40 going on 13!,7,12 April 2021,"Jennifer Garner is a very underused actress, Jennifer Garner is an incredibly underused family comedy actress! She is perfect for this role as a Mum who is no longer considered cool by her elder children and has turned from a daredevil twentysomething into an overprotective parent and I suddenly realising this. Edgar Ramirez is her husband who gets to be the good cop and fun Dad, which understandably is pissing Garner's Allison off.After an incident at school, a plot device, sorry guidance counsellor, mentions the idea of a Yes Day - a day when the parents have to say yes to the children, within a legal and non-life-threatening reason. Allison wants to be the fun Mum, so is talked into and carnage ensues.Actually, this is a good fun family films, Garner is immensely likeable and engaging lead. The kids aren't too annoying. Jenna Ortega, who voices one of the characters in Netflix's Jurassic Park - Camp Cretaceous, is maybe a bit old for the 14-year-old role but is showing signs of being a future lead.Expect lots of parents being children and children trying to get one over on parents, there's also plenty of silliness for the kids (and big kids) and laughs as well as a good moral compass and code.",Yes Day

43,chrisstetz,A sign of the times,4,13 March 2021,"This is an indication of family 'comedies' for years to come, the end result of a movie that has been passed through every filter possible to ensure it cannot possibly offend anyone, of any persuasion, anywhere. Which is obviously now the priority over (god forbid) making something entertaining.What a wonderful world.",Yes Day
44,tmansreviews,Painfully basic plot,4,22 March 2021,"The colorful visuals will grab your attention, but the lack of substance will disappoint. Overall however it accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to be a quirky family comedy.",Yes Day
45,mujali-48677,Terrible,1,17 March 2021,"This film tries so hard to be charming but fails miserably in every aspect. There was not one genuinely funny moment in the entirety of the movie, it all felt contrived. None of the characters are that likeable, but they are annoying. Predictable plot but I'm not really fussed with that, I just expected some belly laughs but it was as if the script was written by someone to whom comedy does not come naturally. As a result, I was relieved when it was over. On the plus, it's not a rude film so is family-friendly. So if you have loved ones that are easily pleased for family movie night and are truly out of other options, then this might be for you.",Yes Day

I stress that this movie suits parents and kids so if you don't have kids you might not be able to relate or like the movie at all. That is why you would probably see very low ratings from some.",Yes Day
48,mayurpanchamia94,Nice n easy.,8,16 March 2021,"Nothing new here! A simple and secured parent vs kids, comic movie here. Feel good, charming at times and definitely comes with a message in the end.Jennifer Garner is beautiful throughout the movie and so is her family. Biased towards the mother of the family being ""dictator"" or boring in Indian terms she and her husband decide to have a ""Yes day"" where they basically can't deny anything, or say ""No"" to anything obviously comes with a set of rules like a Yes day has to be earned etc etc..
End is kinda untasty but still finishable. H.E.R is there in it too for a cameo.Kinda easy and nice. Can be watched on Netflix in a ""boring"" summer afternoon with family over popcorn and cheese sticks with some fresh lime juice/soda. Btw Amul buttermilk also helps.",Yes Day

52,jimwaldothefirst,Hate is a reflection of yourself,9,14 March 2021,"I won't go into details or the plot.The children acted like children
The parents acted like parents
The random stupid adults acted like adultsI think the majority of reviews are hating this movie as the ""YES Idea"" is a rip off from Yes Man with Jim Carrey. Maybe if this was a sequel with Jim Carrey and Zooey Deschanel as the parents it may have been received better.The chances are you will hate the movie if you are single and hate children; this is why you hate children. So in that case they acted amazingly because they made the characters real!! - I am single and hate children...
I have many friends who act like the parents in this movie aswell, so also they did a good job.Its a movie.
Movies, unless based on real events, well, THEY ARE NOT REAL.
If you review a movie as bad because its not for you, its not realistic, you don't get the jokes, or its not a genre you like, then that is a reflection on you, not the movie. Movies don't need to be inspirational or ground breaking, they just need to be an escape from the twisted reality we live in.In general,
My advice for every movie, even if its a sequel or a remake, watch a movie for what it is, with 0 expectations. Sometimes I'm disappointed, sometimes I'm not, and I'm one of those geeks on these ""how many of these 500 movies have you watched"" normally score around 490...",Yes Day
53,downthehobbitholeblog,"A great family fun watch from Netflix, if you enjoyed...",9,12 March 2021,"Based off of a children's book and a growing trend, Netflix's Yes Day is a fun family comedy starring Jennifer Garner as a mom who is struggling to both relate to and parent her kids. The movie isn't for everyone, if you are not a fan of cheesy family comedies, avoid this one. But it's also not just for parents or kids. If you enjoy comedies, have ever felt frustrated by the mundane tasks of being a kid or adult, and want a good laugh- this is a great watch! The premise is that the kids are in charge and that the parents have to say yes to everything they want to do- with some solid boundaries. A break for both the parents who have to say no 'a million times an hour' and the kids who feel like they are never in control. The main goal- a fun family day of connecting and hilarity. Will it go according to plan?? Looking for guidelines for your own yes day or a fuller parent review? Check out our full post on it at Down The Hobbit Hole Blog Yes Day. Netflix is doing a great job with the family movies. I think this will be one of our favorites, along with Animal Crackers. If you like the Pacifier or My Spy- you'll enjoy this one!",Yes Day

To start on a positive not, I didn't hate it. The actors definitely give it 110% and without their passion this would have been even lower. Also, there are some decent scenes in there. The five-step plan was pretty fun, especially the balloon war. There are just so many decisions in this movie where I think: WHY? There is a short movie where the mother is being compared to dictators, there is a crowd chanting daddy, a cop that just lets kids go without checking... It's so incredibly frustrating. I don't get why this movie is even green lit in the first place, but the decisions in the movie are far worse than the story itself. Also, the movie tries so much to be relevant to kids, that it just hard to watch at times. The music is the typical teen tunes and the jokes are more childish than a six-year-old. I know this movie is meant for families and kids, but even for them, it's too much. It's not bad, but just very annoying and frustrating.",Yes Day

The story line was boring and it got predictable fast. Perhaps if I was still 6 years old I would think otherwise, but even that I'm not sure of.By the end of the movie, I was left with one lingering question. Why was the ""Fleek Fest"" concert a furry convention? Maybe it's just me who thought that was weird. Anyways, the movie isn't worth your time, take my word for it.

Duh, good parents do the right thing regardless of other peoples' opinions. That 15 yr old lied and was IN NO WAY MATURE ENOUGH TO GO TO THAT CONCERT ALONE.

For starters the cheesy name to all the stuff like: Fleekfest, Kawosnsjeow ( I have no idea how to say it), etc. The acting is incredibly bad and surrealist. Besides Jenna Ortega alone on the music festival, every piece of acting is incredibly exaggerated. The two kids act terrible. Don't come with the excuse that they are just kids, because there is plenty of good kid actors. For example Millie Bobby Brown, they had just a few guest appearances in other shows, before playing Eleven. However this is a child's movie that must kids will find funny.

Now, everyone is entitled to their opinions and freedom of expression, however, who ever rated this a 5 or higher should be disallowed from giving any more movie ratings or reviews for a while.
It's possible that this is just a silly family viewing attempt, but it's storyline is quite corny: having a ""yes"" day, from parents who always say no, with clownish consequences. It is not really funny, unless, perhaps, you are under the age of ten. Even in the genre of low comedies - and it's questionable if this is a comedy - the characters have to be likable. Yet the characters are not that likable, especially the children, and it's hard to relate to any of them - parents included. Jennifer Garner is not at her best, and the directing comes across as feeble.
So, essentially, a somewhat tedious kids movie to possibly pass the time away.",Yes Day

The kids didn't really love it either, although obviously they weren't as disappointed in it as we were, partly because the concept is great. They love the idea of having a yes day.

106,satriaadhika,"""Yes Day"", When You Are Allowed To Do Anything In One Day",8,1 July 2021,"This film takes a theme that is quite relatable to today's family. Where families who used to be full of adventure, go here and there, but because they have had children for a long time, they are getting busier and busier.Like families in general, mothers are always considered as ""monsters"" who control all their children's activities. Maybe because the father is in the office more often, the mother in this film plays the role of the mother who takes care of everything, so that the children feel bored and think that their mother is not fun.Finally, her mother can also prove that she can be a fun mom. After going through various challenges in ""Yes Day"", his mother was finally able to show that she too can be a fun friend for her child.Each character in this film is described very well. Allison, who has 3 children, is described as a mother who is fun and exciting but still firm and very dear to her child.We can understand why Allison often says no to her children, because she has great concern for her children.The eldest child, Katie is described as a 16-year-old teenager who begins to experience teenage conflicts. For example, wanting to be free to play with friends, wanting to be free from their parents, thinking that they could be fine without the help of their parents.The second child, Evan is described as a child aged around 9-10 years who likes science. He has a great curiosity so he likes to make experiments, but because his mother often does not allow it, he becomes a child who likes to argue.The third child, Ellie is described as a child aged 4-5 years who is innocent and doesn't really understand what is allowed and what is not. He just followed what his brother did. Naturally, he was still small and did not know anything.The character of the father in this film is also clearly described. Viewers are told the reason why his father often says yes to his son and is always a fun dad.It turns out that in the office he is someone who is often considered unattractive and often interferes with the enjoyment of his employees due to work factors. Despite the complexity of the work he does, when he comes home, he can release his burdens by playing with his children.The ranks of the cast, such as Jenna Ortega, Jennifer Garner, Edgar Ramires, and others, successfully brought the characters of each character well.The writer can see their natural acting, so the writer feels that they are like real family. There is no acting that feels stiff. The feel given by each character is also conveyed well and is able to build a warm atmosphere in the film.Behind the excitement and warmth presented in this film. The author himself feels that there are some things that don't make sense in this film, such as visiting various places in one day, then going out of town using an ambulance just to do ""Yes Day"", and the people in this film seem to participate. Celebrate their family's ""Yes Day"".But indeed, it is also what makes the characters in this film develop. How did the children finally realize the reason why their parents often did not allow them.The development of the father's character in this film is also very pronounced, where in the end his father can become a firm father in several ways. Because not always being assertive is bad.The film's ending was closed warmly and succeeded in causing a sense of emotion in the eyes of the audience. How can mothers finally show their love for their children? The presence of singer H. E. R also enlivened the atmosphere in this film.This film proves that sometimes, we need a day where we spend time with family, so that there are no rifts and misunderstandings.Children actually only need friends, and when parents can be fun friends for children, then the family will surely be more harmonious and fun.Every parent has their own way of educating. But behind any way of educating them, the goal remains the same. They just want to be good parents who can educate and protect their children from the dangers that are outside. The family is the protector as well as the main foundation in building a child's character.That's my review of the film ""Yes Day"". Do you also want to try doing ""Yes Day"" with your family?Overall, this film is highly recommended to be watched with family. With its unique theme and supporting cast, this film is one of the must-watch family films in 2021.You can watch this film on Netflix. With a duration of 1 hour 26 minutes, it seems this film will be suitable if watched at night with the family.For those of you who want to watch a light, fun, and entertaining film, you must watch this film!",Yes Day

It was fun too to see some new faces in the dad and children and after a long day it was nice to sit down to a sweet, fun family movie.Of the plot, I liked that even though the premise is 24 hours of yes, by the end of the move the kids have realized that boundaries are important and parents aren't always trying to be fun suckers. It was cool too that the parents even learned something through the experience; the dad learning the importance of supporting and partnering with his wife in the ""bad"" moments and the mom learning to choose into peace when she feels tempted to worry or try and control the situation.All in all it was a good movie. It's not on the same tier as some of my favorites, but I definitely enjoyed watching and would recommend it to anyone else needing a small dose of wholesome, joyful, fun.",Yes Day

112,dellanaron-674-571154,Cute Movie,6,15 March 2021,"I read through reviews before deciding to try and watch and many are so off the mark. I thought this movie was cute. I generally enjoy Jennifer Garner, so that was a plus. Edgar Ramirez was enjoyable to watch, too. No, the kids were NOT annoying. I watched this with my husband. We are both in our 50s and empty nesters. I do agree there could have been a few more laughs, but at least they didn't drag out the juvenile, crude humor so many of these movies do. I think my favorite scene is when the oldest daughter finds herself in a situation where she realizes that she's not as grown up as she thinks and just wants to go home to her family. Some subtle good lessons in the movie. As for all the complainers and low star reviewers - they've all become so desensitized to ""mature"" content that they don't think a movie is good without so called ""adult content"". You know, nudity, sex scenes, profanity and at least one ""f"" bomb. Blows mind how lazy scriptwriters have become; they can't seem to make a movie without it anymore. Do I think this movie could have been a little better? Yes, but it wasn't bad. Just cute.",Yes Day

The film has cringy moments and Pop culture references that are just cringe. The whole film is as well TBH. The inclusion of H. E. R felt unnecessary and she was only there for a cameo. The movie trys to make the mother (Jennifer Garner) the bad guy but it fails. The dad has no purpose being there, and the kids are just brats, who make it out like there parents are bad. The Comedy is very Childish. The acting is average and not outstanding or worth mentiong. The film is really just average.",Yes Day

It's a family movie, intended to be silly, not something competing for a Palme d'Ore. Maybe if you're watching a Netflix movie where the premise is parents have to say yes to everything their preteen kids want to do you should dial back your expectations about the plot?

126,gianmarcocibella,Made me write my 1st review.,1,29 March 2021,"When you watch a movie you have some expectations. Let me be clear and say right away: the finest thing you can expect from this movie is a decent, forgottable moment watching this with your children at home. But if you are looking for something more than just another cliché Netflix project to fill it's catalogue this movie is definitely NOT for you. No cinema lover could possibly like something about this movie. I have watched a lot o bad movies in my life and i can say this is the most predictable movie i've ever seen, i mean you knew where the story was going miles before it happened. The dialogue feels terrible overused and annoying and i couldn't stop thinking about how much Miguel Arteta tried to include latin culture to this movie at the point it felt forced.Perfomances? Not a single member of the cast did something remarkable. Of course, i wasn't expecting much more from the unexperienced cast and the caracthers they had to play. I wasn't expecting much from Garner either, considering i've never fully enjoyed a perfomance from her. The biggest dissapointment i can think of it's Edgar Ramírez. Since he got attatched with Netflix he hasn't be the same. Bad caracthers, bad perfomances, horrible movies. I can't even recognize that guy from a few years ago with a promising carreer. The guy just want's money.",Yes Day

128,CC2021,"Loud, annoying, not funny, not realistic",1,21 March 2021,"Outdated lines and parenting, No chemistry between mom and dad, everyone is overexaggerating everything. As a mom myself, I can tell you that none of my three kids enjoyed this movie, my 11 year old got a headache from it within 30 min in and went off doing his own thing, my other two ended up making forts and only asked for the gummy bear song. That was the literal only thing they cared for in the movie, the song at the beginning. So instead of giving a parents opinion only, which is really what parents actually overuse the word ""no"" now days. It is so outdated. There are alt routes to saying no, its called helping your kids understand the theory as to why, they cannot have or do XYZ at the moment, and then engage them with something else. She is known for saying ""no"" so they have a yes day. But in all that saying no's, she never disciplines or set rules and boundaries other than yelling and more yelling of no. It's senseless. But then the stereotyped children then go above and beyond doing chores and getting better grades for ""yes"" day. I'm unsure about everyone elses kids but I have not experienced or witnessed kids that changed things overnight, taking responsible, all for a future reward. That's something that comes with age and maturity. By day three of that bet, most real kids would already give in expecting more immediate rewards for their change in behavior, listening, better grades, chores, obv the whole premises of this movie bothered me. It's like retraining what you have taught your kids their whole lives in one day, for one future reward. If your a parent and following what I am saying, then maybe that will make some sense. Even my 11 year old hasn't wanted a party or anything crazy as the movie goes. If we did have a yes day, he would probably still do the same things he does now. Because as a parent, giving yes's on a regular helps them find themselves, I'm not saying yes to the things that are beyond unrealistic in this movie. This movie for me, was cringeworthy, loud, and outdated. The husband, and the kids are horrible actors. I have never cared for Jennifer's ""innocent and perfect"" character. As a kid or an adult, I did try. But never again will I watch any movies she tries to act in, they are always annoying, especially with the 1000 weird facial expressions. Maybe the horrible insurance commercials don't help her image but I cannot help but be annoyed with the plastered fake smiles.",Yes Day

186,mcs_wi,30 Going On 13,3,20 March 2021,"I thought ""A comedy with Jennifer Garner? What could go wrong?"" Well, I was mistaken! First, she's' a 40 something mother of 3, with a wuss for a husband, a group of kids who are sooo stereotypical! And, shall I ask how she can keep herself and her husband looking so good without a gym membership? And WHY would she want to go back to work, when they are right in the middle of some of the most critical years of growing up - practically for all 3?! Is she going to get a nanny? Because their oldest daughter doesn't look to have the scruples to handle it. Or, the dad, who gets beat up at work by millennials, is he going to be a stay at home dad? Like the Seavers?! And when Jennifer dressed up like a reprisal of her 2000's movie. I turned it off.",Yes Day
187,camtravel,"Disgraceful, boring and stupid.",1,28 March 2021,"Jennifer Garner's career has to be over after this. Some of the worst film making, bad CGI, fake acting Ive ever seen. Hope the budget was under $100k. Possibly the least entertaining film Ive ever seen.",Yes Day

189,rodrigogomesalmeida,Stupid movie that clearly chose a side,1,6 April 2021,"Everything annoying is about the mother. She doesn't let her children do anything and is surprised when she does, even if it was all years of curiosity and desires being discharged. Even though she claims to have no time, she curiously wins at Kowblowley's matches by doing an acrobatics that a person who doesn't have time EVER knew how to do.The film wants to blame everyone but her. In the father, since he ""is the hero of the children"" - even though he is the villain in his work and the children are an emotional support. In children because they are stupid and don't know what they can't do - because they never did anything, in fact, no one really left.Stupid film that only causes stress, it should have a much lower grade than that.",Yes Day

194,ady_you_rock,"Oh, just no.",3,12 March 2021,"I was really excited to see this movie after watching the trailer which looked really nice. The movie, not at all. It is uninspired, full of bad jokes, boring scenes, very unrealistic, poor acting and a total lack of humour. Children under 14 would probably like it, but it is definitely not for adults.",Yes Day
195,carltonblue09,This hurt my soul,3,12 March 2021,"I watched this without kids present, which was my first mistake of many with this film. A first issue I had was that the opening scenes give away the whole story (cool woman gets boring when she has kids, then realises she has to be cool again to win their respect back). Let's be honest, the parents are terrible characters and let their kids get away with downright dangerous activities. Even on the 'Yes Day', the kids do their best to hurt everyone involved. Script and acting felt forced throughout, I won't be recommending this to anyone.",Yes Day
196,redeyedcutie,Worth one-time Family Fun,6,31 May 2021,"I don't grade anything 7 or above unless I really feel like I'd enjoy a rewatch or at least get more out of the movie on a rewatch. This movie was fun and silly, and if you can suspend your disbelief, it does a great job of raising the stakes to compliment the premise. I would recommend parents talk to their kids about any parenting opposition your kids have. This movie is a great jumping board into that subject. I know I was most frustrated with parents when they didn't tell me WHY they drew a line. The idea of earning a Yes Day is really interesting.",Yes Day

I promised them that if they ate good food, they could eat anything they want on Saturday morning. The idea has been a success for a few years but NOW THIS!! AMAZING! Great writing and ideas. I'm so impressed by those incredible little actors. My daughter is an actress on the Punky Brewster reboot and I know exactly how much work it must've taken to create such perfectly timed and funny scenes I hope we get to meet some of these actors in real life because I'm sure they're even more fun than the characters they portray.",Yes Day

208,vargfran,"Spoiled characters , hard to relate to. Truly soul crushing",1,2 April 2021,"I can see how wealthy (ish) families may enjoy this film specially in the US where people seem to be a bit excessive and uncaring of consequence ?Coming from a poor 3rd world country watched this with parents, partner and my younger brother who is in the same age group as the older sibling in the film.It was extremely upsetting and hard to understand. Was a completely different world to our upbringing. How could the kids be so mean when constantly given so much , and the ""no's"" where small and reasonable , anyways we both died a bit inside. We all found it very hard to relate to even my brother whose is in his early teens couldn't handle it.I agree with the premise some yes and some reward here and there is ideal but this film takes first world , rich , American spoiled kids and takes them to the next level of brat-hood, it was truly soul crushing , can't imagine what the carbon emissions of the YES generation are gonna be seeing so many parents liking and defending this film.Also I'm Venezuelan, was so sad to find out the actor and character for the dad is too ... Was excited when the film started of with arepas and from then onwards it was the 9 circles of hell.If you are from a down to earth background and have struggled in the past, regardless of the family context I don't think you will overly enjoy the film, my mum looked like she wanted to cry, but again I think it really depends on culture / country of origin wether you can relate or not.",Yes Day

I watched It with my mom yesterday and absolutely loved it. It was outrageous and campy just as expected. Obviously Jennifer Garner shines as Mom but I also thought Dad and the child actors did a great job too! If you'd like to watch a film that doesn't require too much thought and is fun for the kids too, I'd suggest this one! Will definitely watch again in the future! :)",Yes Day

A totally useless dad who realizes he is a parent and that it comes with responsibilities when his daughter is already an adolescent, a mom that has to take 100% of the responsibility in a supposedly 2-parent household...
We watched it with our 9-year old and had to pause at times to comment on the extremely old-fashioned situation portrayed and how that is not ok. Can't believe this movie is from 2021, seems more like 1951.",Yes Day
