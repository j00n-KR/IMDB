0,Leofwine_draca,"Looks fantastic, at least",5,12 April 2019,"THE LOVE WITCH is a fresh-feeling mix of comedy and horror with a quite wonderful look to it; the director has gone for a 1960s camp approach and as such this is vibrant, colourful, and wonderfully old-fashioned in terms of the visuals. A shame, then, that the story is so slight and really dragged out to a two-hour running time when it didn't need to be. A series of quirky performances tell a story about a lovelorn woman who turns to black magic in order for the men in her life to love her; of course, things don't go according to plan. It's an old story, utilised to make some nice comments on the issues surrounding feminism, but I found the story a bit too sexualised and the actual content a bit too light - even if it does look fantastic.",The Love Witch
1,claudio_carvalho,"Overrated, Unfunny, Tacky and Annoying",3,8 February 2017,"The witch Elaine (Samantha Robinson) moves to a small town expecting to find her prince charming. She befriends the local Trish (Laura Waddell) that introduces her husband Richard (Robert Seeley) to her. Soon Elaine seduces Wayne (Jeffrey Vincent Parise) but her spell is too strong and the man dies. When Trish travels and Leaves Richard alone, Elaine seduces him and he does not resist to her charm and commits suicide. Detective Griff (Gian Keys) investigates the case and stumbles upon Elaine that believes he is the love of her life. Will Griff resist to Elaine's spell?""The Love Witch"" is an overrated, unfunny, tacky and annoying film by the unknown Anna Biller that tells the story of the nymphomaniac witch Elaine. It is impressive that after 180 minutes running time it is impossible to laugh of any scene. The film and the acting are so bad that probably these are the jokes. The colors and the locations are tacky. The makeup is so heavy that it is not possible to know whether the lead ""actress"" is beautiful or not. At least she has a beautiful body and maybe this is the only attraction since she is naked most of the time. The music score is absolutely annoying. The best way to see this movie is using the fast forward button to find Samantha Robinson half-naked. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Love Witch
2,nogodnomasters,I give you the rainbow,4,5 August 2017,"Elaine (Samantha Robinson) leaves San Francisco following the death of her husband to arrive in Eureka, California. She is a witch who makes love potions. Things don't go well for the people of Eureka.This is an homage to 60's films. The font, cinematography, style, art, music, cars, etc. are all throwbacks to the ""B"" films of that era. It also captures accurate names and customs of modern Wicca rites, kudos on the research. The film moved slowly, with long conversations that can put you to sleep. Elaine's seduction scene was repetitive. The plot dragged. A fluff film for people who think themselves cool.Guide: Sex and nudity. No swearing...like most films in the genre.",The Love Witch
3,kosmasp,Throwback in the now,6,3 October 2019,"If you were to judge the costumes, the make up, the over-acting and other things you might find yourself believing this is a movie set in the 70s. But it is not. While the characters do act and give out a 70s vibe, this is in the current time (technology is one of the give aways).Unfortunately that also brings logical errors. Which may have been included to stay in line with the movies of that period. Because if you like the style you will obviously love this way more than my 6/10 is telling you it is worth. Staying as objective as possible is tough. Because I also do like what they do, but the flaws in character especially and decisions (ending) is failing in a way. Strands are being left unanswered, which may leave you dissatisfied. Nudity will not be able to change that to the better I reckon",The Love Witch
4,gavin6942,A Darn Fine Vision That Runs Much Too Long,6,17 July 2016,"A modern-day witch (Samantha Robinson) uses spells and magic to get men to fall in love with her, in a tribute to 1960s pulp novels and Technicolor melodramas.Making its Canadian premiere at Fantasia on July 16, ""The Love Witch"" swooped in to Montreal with high recommendations. Hollywood Reporter has lauded it, as have the New Yorker, Rue Morgue, Chris Alexander for ShockTilYouDrop and Jason Coffman for Film Monthly. With everyone who is anyone in the world of film criticism coming out behind it, who could dare disagree? Writer-director Anna Biller knew exactly what she was doing when she attempted to make this a throwback to the classic sexploitation films. Shot on glorious 35mm, the colors are vivid and absolutely striking, both in the film's overall look, and in the costuming and makeup. The set design even captures what I picture the West Coast in the 1960s must have been, a world of witchcraft where Anton LaVey would have felt at home. (Some critics have grumbled about the blend of 1960s and modern vehicles and cell phones; I can appreciate their desire for purity, but that was never really the point.) Although the art direction and cinematography are what capture the look, the acting completes that illusion. The acting is terrible, but in the most wonderful way. Presumably, the actors were forced to watch an endless loop of trailers for films from Something Weird Video until they mastered the stilted language and mannerisms. Although Samantha Robinson is obvious the star and carries every sequence, Jeffrey Vincent Parise (GENERAL HOSPITAL) as Wayne was really the high-water mark for over-the-top melodrama. All of the characters had something a little off about them to make them endearing. And I love that the lead detective in the film is named Griff. I'd like to see this as a nod to the films of Sam Fuller, though it's probably just a coincidence.Not to sound like a carbon copy, but just as much as I agree with the film's praise, I also follow in line with some of the negative observations. Frank Scheck of Hollywood Reporter says the film ""might have benefited from some trimming, with several segments depicting wiccan rituals going on a bit too long."" Where I differ is that I would go much further on this point, as Biller's editing is the real downfall of the film. Presumably, after all the hard work of writing, directing and decorating, Biller (now wearing the editor hat) didn't have the heart to trim her hard work. And this is a real shame, because after the first quarter to a third of the movie, the pace feels increasingly slow and the film as a whole comes off as awfully long. A half dozen sequences could have been cut entirely, or alternately a solid 20 minutes could have been removed to pick up the pace. A film this brilliant and visually sumptuous should not be risking putting its audience to sleep, but that's precisely what ends up happening.And that's the long and short of it. Whether this film actually has a feminist message or is a film for women as Biller claims, I couldn't say. But it is unique, and a ridiculously successful throwback to the exploitation films that genre fans (myself included) are passionate about. When the film opens to a wider audience this fall, I expect it will hit home with a wide variety of viewers and may achieve minor cult status. However, if Biller (or someone else) trims a few minutes here and there between now and October, this could go well beyond cult and be a mainstream hit.",The Love Witch
5,paul_haakonsen,A rather interesting movie...,6,14 June 2017,"First of all I must admit that it took me two attempts to actually get through this movie. Not because this was a bad movie, don't get me wrong. The first time I made it some 25 minutes into it before I had to leave it, as my wife wasn't impressed with what was transpiring on the screen. So I returned to the movie some two weeks later by myself, because I thought that the movie definitely deserved a chance, because I was entertained by what I had seen so far back then during the first round......And I am glad that I did return to watch ""The Love Witch"", because this is definitely an interesting and entertaining movie. I fear that this might be a movie that will be grossly underrated or overlooked, because it is definitely not a mainstream movie. If you happen to pick up this movie, you definitely owe it to yourself to take the time and sit down to watch it.So ""The Love Witch"" is set in a modern age, yet there is something very 1970's about it, from the way that people dress, the make-up and the hairstyles. So was the movie supposed to take place during the 1970s or what? If so, then they sure did fail to get the authenticity correct with the cars in most of the scenes where there were cars, as they were cars of newer models. So was this set in the 1970s or modern age spiced up with that unique 1970s wardrobe? That was a little bit confusing.Samantha Robinson was really great in her portrayal of Elaine, the witch character. She had a particular presence and charm to her which instantly made her the center of attention. Plus it really helped a lot that the costume and make-up department got the character spot on with the wardrobe and cosmetics. This was the first time that I got acquainted with Samantha Robinson and her talent, and she definitely seems like she could be very well on her way for bigger and greater things in Hollywood.The cast in ""The Love Witch"" was actually quite good, and it was especially Samantha Robinson who carried the movie. But the cast in general were doing good jobs with their given roles and characters, and the talented performers were nicely cast for these characters.""The Love Witch"" has an alluring and very fitting music score that really accompanies the movie quite well.Writer and director Anna Biller really had managed to conjure up something quite magical here with what she did with ""The Love Witch"". Ranging from dialogue and characters to mood and atmosphere, then it was all a great combination that definitely had been put a lot of thought and effort into.The visuals effects in the movie were also very 1970's, having a very psychedelic feel to it, it terms of color, appearance and function. This was working very well in favor of the movie.Labeled as a horror comedy, I somehow failed to see the horror aspect of ""The Love Witch"". It was more of a dark magical comedy of sorts - if there even is such a genre.Being a movie that revolves around a witch who uses magic to obtain the love of men, there is of course some occult and supernatural aspect to the movie as well. It is done with enough grace and respect without delving into being too much of a focal point for the movie.""The Love Witch"" can be somewhat of an acquired taste, and I think that you must indeed have a love for the world of cinema to truly appreciate ""The Love Witch"" for what it is. This is not your ordinary mainstream movie by any means.",The Love Witch
6,trashgang,"a delight for lovers of sixties, early seventies horror",6,17 March 2017,"This is a difficult one to review because it isn't really a horror. There's nothing scary about it and I can understand that a lot of geeks out there rejected this throwback to the sixties early seventies.If you watch it in that perspective then you will like this a lot because the way the cinematography was done is clearly an ode to those days. In fact, the score, the editing, the lighting, the colour grading the way of acting and speaking, it's all done in a sixties style. Maybe for some clocking in at two hours is way too long for some and I can understand that because it's all talking and talking. But it do offers some 'magick' when the witches arrive. It's so beautifully done and it all looks like a real coven. The nudity, the rituals, everything.So if you are into witchcraft then this is one to pick up. If you are into very old horrors with talking and talking it's your stuff. If you think you are going to see gore or even red stuff, forget it.

7,christopher-underwood,The soundtrack is great,7,28 March 2017,"From the director of Viva, this has the same attention to period detail, with so much loving going into the interior detail and colour and the lavish costumes and make-up. I enjoyed this one but not as overwelmingly as the previous film. There is no lesser an affection for the genre, 60s/70s sex and witchcraft, but I don't think the genre has quite the same potential and the earlier sex and drugs homage. Clearly Anne Biller is totally fascinated with the period and whilst it would have been easy to make a comedy making fun of the films she has rightly resisted but we are left with something somewhat unfullfilling. Many have suggested this is too long and this may be so because without a strong storyline, it is difficult to get by, just on imitation and attention to detail, however successful. The soundtrack is great, much Morricone of course, and this helps and not least the fantastic performance from Samantha Robinson who gets it absolutely right in every scene.",The Love Witch
8,Red-Barracuda,A bold and seductive retro-styled horror melodrama,7,20 June 2016,"The first thing I have to say about The Love Witch is that it is one of the most beautiful looking new films I have seen for quite some time. Shot on 35mm it is sumptuously photographed, with exquisite use of colour and costuming throughout. It's a treat for the eyes, clearly going for the look of a film made in 1971. It achieves this very successfully, except perhaps for the presence of background modern vehicles and a scene with a mobile phone. Director Anna Biller – who also impressively wrote and produced this as well as scored some of it and made a lot of the great outfits – says that the film is supposed to be set in contemporary times but to be honest it never feels this way! This feels like it's circa 1970 all the way and, quite frankly, all the better for it. This extends to the acting styles, lighting and compositions, which all hark back to the styles of this earlier glorious cinematic era. Topping it off, there is some music taken directly from the 1971 films The Fifth Cord and A Lizard in a Woman's Skin, both composed by soundtrack genius Ennio Morricone. These bits of avant-garde mood music are full of tension and female sighs and really fit into the feel of the film very well. The fact that the music also comes specifically from Italian giallo films cannot also be a coincidence. These stylish pulp thrillers hit their peak in the early 70's and much of the visual feel of The Love Witch felt like it was at least partially a homage to the delirious colourful approach these movies embraced back in the day.The story is about an urban witch whose ultimate aim is to get the perfect man. She moves to a new house and immediately starts ensnaring men in her deadly web. Newcomer Samantha Robinson plays the title role and she is very impressive. She certainly looks the part with her great outfits and outstandingly provocative eye make-up. Her performance is lightly erotic and humorous. There are in actual fact several somewhat funny moments sprinkled throughout the movie with all of the actors successfully contributing. Unusually for a film of its type, it has a feminist message interwoven into it. Biller made the quite valid point that if you want men to listen to feminist ideas in a movie then you really have to include them in a film that they are liable to pitch up to in the first place. To this end we have a film featuring, on the one hand, a gorgeous seductive sensual witch, while at the same time, some feminist theory added to the mix – so everyone's a winner basically.It could probably be argued that at two hours it's a bit overlong. But I loved the ambition and, in particular, the visual beauty of the thing. It's certainly one of the more bold and interesting genre experiments of recent years. Clearly it is going to divide audiences, as it will be too much for some folks to fully get behind but I think if you have a particular love of the early 70's strand of exploitation cinema then this one has a pretty good chance of rocking your boat.",The Love Witch
9,paul2001sw-1,Reconfiguring reality,7,13 July 2020,"'Love Witch' is an audacious movie. A coven of witches dedicate themselves to giving sexual pleasure to men, in order to ensure true love between the sexes; but it doesn't tend to work out too well for the recipients. The film is visually rich, yet seems to take place alternately in the present day, the 1960s, Victorian England and the Mediaeval period; I'm reminded in some senses of Malcolm Pryce's wonderful noir-detective stories set in Aberystwyth, which take place in a similarly altered reality, imaginatively reconfigured from the real world. Kudos should go to writer-director Anna Bellin for bringing such a world to life on screen; and just as Price stylistically nods to Raymond Chandler, Bellin's movie plays clear homage to Hammer horror movies. Of course, underlying the absurdity is the fact that actual accusations of witchcraft were often associated with charges of (and fear of) ""loose"" morals in the female sex; and the real world is still very much one in which women are put under enormous social pressure to both express and repress their sexuality. Possibly, 'Love Witch' is a little long; for all its inventiveness, after a while we have the joke. But one has to admire its originality, provocativeness, and visual splendour.",The Love Witch
10,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Visually stunning, but narratively weak.",4,11 May 2018,"'The Love Witch (2016)' is without a doubt a shining technical achievement, the visually stunning sixties stylings are a sight to behold and the general throw-back vibe is almost pitch-perfect. Sadly, the script and story are lacking, to say the least. That's not to suggest it doesn't have a point, in fact it seems to be making some sort of misguided commentary on gender and sexuality in several scenes that stop the 'plot' to become preachy. This is made more head-scratching when you realise that the 'satire' is supposed to be serious, with the philosophy of the piece portrayed entirely earnestly on the part of the director (who wore many hats on this production). The feature just meanders about for far too long and doesn't really provide much in the way of character or narrative. Thus, I was actively bored for quite a while. 4/10",The Love Witch
11,clanciai,A deep dive into the abyss of the occult and its modern manifestations with great aestheticism,9,22 May 2017,"I expected no good of this film but was prepared for silly new age nonsense and weird sex play of kinky nature and was greatly surprised by the high artistry of this very modern film which nonetheless hits a timeless character. Everything in it is good, it's a fascinating play with imagination, the story develops constantly into more ingenious innovations, in spite of the dominating occult ingredients it's very logical all the way, the actors are all good and convincing although they more often than not go over the top, and especially the music is very well made. The wedding scene tops the film and establish its character of almost Shakespearian timelessness, like in the forest of Arden, and although many would find the finale objectionable and unnecessary, it can at the same time be seen as inevitable.Above all, it offers a very interesting insight into occult developments of the present world with the revival of ancient paganism, which is a very dynamic movement occurring all over the world today, maybe as a counterpoise to the threat of Islam, and the several ritual scenes are among the best in the film. This was a fascinating experience and something quite out of the ordinary and the more appreciated for its originality.",The Love Witch
12,Thanos_Alfie,Overrated...,3,15 June 2020,"""The Love Witch"" is a Romance - Horror movie in which we watch a young woman uses magic in order her perfect man to fall in love with her.I did not like this movie because of its boring plot, poor interpretations made by its cast and a below average direction. I also believe that it's an extremely overrated movie and I do not recommend anyone to watch it because I am sure that you will lose your time watching it as I unfortunately did.",The Love Witch
13,Tweetienator,An Unique One,9,21 September 2017,"First time I watched the movie it was a stunning experience, the tone of strangeness, the fine music, the ""coloring"", indeed, it is a strange movie. And for the first 15 minutes, till the movie got me, I didn't know what I watched, what I should expect.The Love Witch I guess will split most of the audience into two groups - one group will find the movie extraordinary and genius, the other group will be bored or will maybe feel that the movie is too artificial. I for certain belong to the first group.I guess it helps for understanding the story if you have some knowledge about occultism, there is a lot of stuff more going on (not only the obvious like potion making etc.) and if you know some basics about magick you will understand more of what's going on then the uneducated ""muggle"". Or at least your mind will trick you to find such stuff and connections ;)Anyway, this movie is imo a very special one: adventurous, daring and experimental. And the 70s style of Technicolor-coloring is really an eye balm and a very hypnotic experience (I don't understand why it isn't used anymore, looks far better at least for certain genres as the modern, digital stuff) and well supported by a fantastic and strange soundtrack.And like the almighty Arnold once stated: ""I don't play Conan, I am Conan"", for me Samantha Robinson is the perfect Love Witch.Last words: if the movie making industry would deliver more of such experimental and daring movies, that would be just fantastic. Well, wait a moment, maybe I should do some movie magick! ;)",The Love Witch
14,paul-allaer,Anna Biller's labor of love is a unique film experience,8,5 December 2016,"""The Love Witch"" (2016 release; 120 min.) brings the story of Elaine, the self-proclaimed ""love witch"". As the movie opens, we see Elaine, in a bright red dress, driving her bright red Mustang convertible, on her way to a friend's apartment (turns out Elaine's luggage is also bright red). It's not long before we realize that after Elaine's husband Jerry left her ""I died but then I was reborn as a witch"", and now Elaine uses love potions in her quest to attract Mr. Charming. Unfortunately (or perhaps fortunately for us the viewers), these love potions are at times too strong. At this point we are not even 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: first and foremost, this movie is nothing short of a labor of love from Anna Biller, who previously brought us ""Viva"". Let me count the ways: Biller writes, produces, directs, designs the costumes and set, and composes the original score for this. So yes, this is an ""Anna Biller Production"" from A to Z. Here Biller uses witchcraft and femininity to bring a visually rich, even at times over-stimulating, story about ""women empowerment"". Even though the movie is set in today, the movie's tone, style and overall vibe is deeply rooted in the 60s. The photography's color palette is deeply striking as well, where bright colors are jumping at you. I must admit that during the first 20-15 min., it all seemed like a giant pastiche or send-up of 1960s movies (not unlike the Austin Powers movies), but once you get beyond the initial surprise, the movie actually settles and is far deeper than just a joke or a send-up (even if you'll find that plentiful in the movie of course). Special kudos to Ms, Biller for the exquisite set designs, in particular keeping in mind this movie was made for a nickel and a dime (certainly by Hollywood standards). My comments would be incomplete without mentioning the outstanding performance by Samantha Robinson (whom I was not familiar with before this) in the title role. Beware: there is quite a bit of nudity in the film, so if that bothers you, you may wish to stay away from this movie. Bottom line: I can honestly tell you that this movie is one of the more unique films I've seen this year, but ""The Love Witch"" delivers, and then some.I had seen the trailer for this, and recently ""The Love Witch"" opened at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so (about 10 people altogether), but those who were there clearly enjoyed it quite a bit, with frequent laughing and hollering (especially from the women in the audience!). If you are in the mood for a truly unique film that is ""way out there"", if not beyond that, I might suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""The Love Witch"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",The Love Witch
15,Stevieboy666,Beautiful use of colour but too long,6,9 June 2019,"This is the story of a beautiful witch called Elaine, well played by Samantha Robinson, who uses spells to get men to fall in love with her but every time she finds one it ends tragically.
Fantastic use of colour here, in particular reds, pinks and blues. It is also an homage to the style of the films from the 1960's of the likes of Hitchcock. Plus it does serve as an interesting insight to the world of witchcraft for those who are not learned in the topic, in particular wicca or white magic.And it has plenty of nudity. However, after an engaging first hour the second hour is unnecessarily long and sadly lets the film down.",The Love Witch
16,dfranzen70,That eyeshadow is always on point.,4,23 April 2019,"I fully appreciate the *look* of this movie, for starters. It's got the sheen of a late-60s/early-70s thriller mashed with an Italian giallo, minus all the blood and gore. It's very fab. And the performances, particularly by lead Samantha Robinson, are fantastic. Even the makeup deserves quite a bit of praise, it's so on point. Everything seems to be in place and just so, except for the plot. The surreal air that envelops the proceedings masks a fairly pedestrian plot, that of a witch who cast spells in order to find her true love, with the help of her cult, er, fellow witches, some of whom are routinely naked. Like I said, the movie has all the feel of a period piece, but there just isn't much there, and after a while the viewer may become as bored as I did. Which is unfortunate, given the level of effort and talent.",The Love Witch
17,dar0417,Better than people give it credit for,7,24 June 2020,Better than people give it credit for. Beautifully shot and acted. The late 60s' theme works great.

18,jfgibson73,Perfect Love and Perfect Trust,7,8 December 2019,"It's hard to believe this was made in 2016--they've done an amazing job recreating a late 60's/early 70's vibe. Visually, this movie is wonderful to look at, and all the costumes and sets feel like they are from that same era. However, I would be hesitant to recommend this to many people because the story requires you to be all in on the concept. It's a throwback, as I said, and you can't expect it to have modern sensibilities about pacing or content. That said, I enjoyed it all the way through. It kept me guessing what would happen up to the end. It did go a bit long but that didn't bother me. Everything tied together eventually. Worth a watch.",The Love Witch
19,TdSmth5,Lovely but noncommittal,7,15 April 2017,"A girl named Elaine moves to a new town and a new place. The real estate agent befriends her and invites her for tea to some fancy place. They talk about relationship and love. Elaine is single after the death of her ex and is desperate for love. The agent has been married for years and doesn't understand Elaine's need for love. Turns out Elaine is also a witch. She starts making products for witchcraft and selling them to a local spiritual store. In flashbacks we learn about her ex a bit; we also see her ceremony of initiation. At a strip joint she runs into her witchcraft masters, some couple.Soon Elaine meets a professor who instantly falls for her. He takes her to his cabin where she cooks for him, does a little strip dance and he goes completely crazy for her, gets sick and dies. She does some witchcraft with her urine, a used tampon and some other stuff and buries the body.When the real estate agent travels out of town, Elaine hooks up with and seduces her husband who also goes mad for her and ends up committing suicide.Meanwhile, the cops start investigating the disappearance of the professor and find the body and the witchcraft. Soon they find out about Elaine and interview her. Elaine immediately falls for the cop in charge. They go out on a date, end up in some goofy renaissance fair organized by the witch couple who do some binding/marriage ceremony for the two. With that the investigation into Elaine is dropped. When the real estate woman goes to Elaine's place she finds things she shouldn't and provides it to the police. When Elaine meets her guy at the strip joint, the patrons want her burned. They manage to escape. And Elaine won't be able to help herself in regard to her new guy.The Love Witch does have the look and feel of a late 60s early 70s movie. It also has a certain timelessness. It's not clear how much time goes by in the movie. This is enhanced by anachronistic elements like contemporary cars and cell phones. Some people object to it, I find it fine. Male left-brain thinking won't get you very far with this movie. It is true that the movie is too long and a bit too kitschy. The cheesy marriage thing in the woods should have been removed altogether.One does wonder though what the message of this movie is. In that regard it's a success though because one expects something of a message. Our witch pretty much only talks about love and has interesting things to say about relationships. She says she's addicted to love, but once she has men madly in love with her, she ends up...killing them. She doesn't like men who cry, but the tough men she likes aren't the ones who fall in love with her, as usually happens in life.Our witch to some extent represents some old-fashioned view. She dreams of preparing meals for her man, of satisfying his needs, something the real estate agent finds outrageous and beneath her. She represents the current view which is all about equality and power. Of course those two are mutually exclusive. And sure enough, while Elaine is conducting her seduction ritual she cooks and completely sympathizes with her victims much to their astonishment. They've never met a woman who understood them.I appreciated this unabashed femininity by Elaine and the movie as a whole. The problem is that it's not clear whether the writer/director is celebrating or mocking it.The lovely Samantha Robinson carries this movie. While others complain about her stiff acting, she's not the only one acting this way in the movie, which suggests it's what the director wanted. A movie about a witch in that era should have included more nudity, especially by our lead actress, but it's another area the director isn't quite sure. There's plenty of Tarzan nudity with actresses wearing underpants and their hair covering their chest.There's a lot to like about The Love Witch but it's not entirely satisfying either. But in a time that celebrates transactional relationships and where partners are seen as an aspirational accessory instead of as companions, this movie is much needed.",The Love Witch
20,s3276169,Homage to 70's sexploitation horror flicks,7,5 February 2017,"Love Witch is a homage to 70's sexploitation horror flicks.There's nothing even remotely pretentious about this film. Its unselfconscious in its camp, cheesy, 70's style, B grade, sexy horror schlockiness.That's not to say this is a bad film. Viewed from the perspective of a satirical take on mostly long forgotten, horror flicks in this sub genre, its actually quite good. There's a polished corniness that can been seen in Love Witch. Real care has been taken with the puerile voice overs, the colorfully crude visuals, the over stated, heavily scripted, almost monotone dialogue, cheesy 70's set pieces and the films absurdly misogynistic tone. Samantha Robinson is perfect as the Love Witch. She takes a role that's far from straight laced but plays it with such straight laced conviction, that it convincingly draws you in. If you were not around in the 70's this film may seem a little inaccessible. That said, if you remember this decade, even a little and some of the truly awful, lurid horror films that came out of it, you may find Love Witch a chuckle worthy nostalgia trip. Seven out of ten from me.",The Love Witch
21,truemythmedia,Perfect,10,21 August 2019,"Everything about this movie is 5 Star quality.The production design is the first thing that grabs you. The retro 60s/70s vibe it gives off lends a fairy tale quality to the entire film and suggests that the movie you are in for might be a little old fashioned but in the best way possible. The colors are vibrant and meaningful and the costumes are actually used quite deftly to reinforce the themes of the film.As Elaine begins a new life in a new town and reacquaints herself with an old friend, that old fashioned quality continues to rear its head through Elaine's ideas and conversations about needing men and how to get them. By giving them everything they could possibly want of course.This old fashioned, sometimes not-so-old-fashioned attitude, gives Elaine tremendous confidence that she will be able to woo a man, even her friend's husband, but keeping a man is another story. Her elation and frustration with men forms the meat of the tale which ranges from play marriages conducted at a renaissance festival to the seduction of a detective investigating the mysterious ritualistic murder of a man from Elaine's old town.Again, I find myself lost to pick stand out moments or scenes from the film because it flows seamlessly between witchcraft driven sexual rites (remarkable tastefully done), afternoon tea, and internal monologues about men, women, and the sexual games, power dynamics, and longing for relationship they invariably seem to engage in with each other.These themes are what makes the film a 5 Star film. Without them, sure the move looks great, is well and stylistically acted, and excels at creating a fairy tale dreamlike atmosphere, but without anything to say, who cares about all that, or at least, I would care very little.This film is a strong piece which embodies and relates feminist viewpoint. As a white formerly-protestant male, that isn't always my cup of tea. Often, I can walk out of a movie with that sort of a POV and feel like I am somehow all that is wrong with the world. What I loved about this movie was that even as it comes from that point of view and features a protagonist who murders men she is unhappy with, I never felt like it was attacking me.That is a very difficult thing to do and not something most filmmakers bother to even attempt. Then again, that isn't the only thing Director Anna Biller does for this film that most filmmakers don't attempt. This film was in production for years because she designed every set, costume, and piece of artwork in the film. Such a personal touch from a director is unheard of in any world other than the indie film scene, usually without much success.This film, however, is a triumph that owes everything to Biller and the weaving of the many threads of film production which she personally spun, creating a vision totally unique to her.",The Love Witch
22,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Throwback,8,26 March 2019,"This was a film I heard about on some podcasts when I first started listening to them. I was really confused from the title as it doesn't sound like it would be a horror film. Technically I would say that this isn't a horror film, but it does deal with as the title states, witches. It also has murder and magic as well. The official synopsis is a modern-day witch uses spells and magic to get men to fall in love with her.We kick this off with a woman driving along a coastal road. She is Elaine (Samantha Robinson). There is a voice-over narration informing us that she was in love with a man named Jerry (Stephen Wozniak), but he broke her heart. The way she tells it, he died of natural causes, but it looks more like murder from the images that are flashed throughout the film. She is then pulled over by Griff (Gian Keys). She is quite nervous around police, which we learn is because of her being a suspect previously. He gives her a warning and sends her on her way.In town she meets with Trish (Laura Waddell). She is the interior decorator for an apartment of her friend. She is going to stay there while she is in town. The two of them go out for lunch and tea. It is here we learn more about Elaine. She is a witch and she really wants to find love. She actually has a skewed view of life and thinks that a woman's only job is a please a man. This bothers Trish, who is more of a modern woman, where the two of them are equals. It is here that we meet Trish's husband, Richard (Robert Seeley).Elaine meets Wayne (Jeffrey Vincent Parise), who is a local professor. She falls for him and he is intrigued by her. They decide to go to his cottage in the woods. It is there that he comes on to her and she makes him slow down. She does give him a love potion and they finally go to his bedroom. He gets quite emotional though and ends up dying of a broken heart.This saddens Elaine as she continues to look for the love of her life and no man is safe from her and her spells. We also meet more from the coven as well, which some of the townspeople don't really like living in their city.Now when I heard this was coming to my theater because of a podcast that is based here, I was quite intrigued. I saw the trailer a few times and decided I was going to be in attendance. I should point out as well that I watched it on a 35mm print. What really struck me was the film has a surreal vibe. I think a lot of that comes from the fact this film is set in modern times, but the way the characters are dressed makes it feel like 1970's. It also really felt like it could be a Hammer horror film with the sets and the vivid colors as well. It was really trippy, but I dug it.This film is really a feminist film as well. Elaine is really trying to set women back. She is so concerned with finding a husband and she thinks that women should cater to all of their needs. As a male, I wouldn't like this to be honest. Trish actually has it right though in that it should be a partnership. This does create problems though as Elaine gives men the fantasies they want. She really wants a strong man, but her potions and how she treats them breaks them.With the magic used, there is this weird aspect of the coven. Gahan (Jared Sandford) is the leader along with his wife Barbara (Jennifer Ingrum). The odd thing though Gahan really reminds me of the Church of Satan founder, Anton Lavey. I'm betting this film being a parody is doing this intentionally. The thing this coven is teaching women though is really good. It is them knowing their self-worth and using what they were given to get what they want.Something I'm really surprised by with this film is that despite the 2 hour running time, it really didn't feel like it. The film moves along at a good pace and it is interesting seeing Elaine move through these men as she is looking for the love of her life. She is quite selfish and despicable, but I still found myself rooting for her. I will say that the ending is a bit abrupt, but it wasn't where I thought they were going. I would have preferred something else to happen, but what we got I thought was good. It really sums up the film pretty well actually and is probably better than what I thought, as that would make her martyr.The acting for this film is interesting. Robinson killed this role. I found her to be absolutely beautiful and a lot of that is her make-up is always on point. She has a great smile and I loved to listen to her talk. Now her character is completely crazy and horrible as well, but I thought she brought the role to life. Her body was great to boot. There is a hint of something more there, which includes low self-esteem. All of the men I'll lump together as being solid. They are distinct, but meet similar demises. I thought Waddell was really good as the sane, counter balance that I end up feeling bad for. I also thought Sanford, Ingrum and the rest of the cast round out the film for what was needed as well.Now there's not a lot in the way of effects, but I do have to commend the film for the visual effects we get. There's a moment where Wayne is on drugs and there's odd light around Elaine. I thought it was good to put us in the feeling and seeing what he is. The sets in the film are great. There was some blood which looked good, but that was about it. If you couldn't tell, I thought the film looked beautiful as well.The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack, which is again amazing. There were such differing songs, but they fit and enhance the scenes. Some of these do not feature dialogue or we will go stretches without it. The music then takes over to set the mood of the scene. I also like the voice-over narration in the few places we get it to fill in things that we otherwise wouldn't know.With that said, this film wasn't necessarily what I was expecting, but I liked it. The film has an odd 1970's feel and aesthetic like a Hammer film while being set in modern times. That helps to give it a surreal feel. There is a lot of deeper meaning in the film, which I really enjoyed. Mixing in the witchcraft and what not was also a good touch. The acting I thought was good, especially from Robinson. The visual effects look good as do the little practical effects we got. The film was shot beautifully and music fit exactly what they needed. This film isn't for everyone, but I definitely dug it. I think overall this is a good one to check out in my opinion.",The Love Witch
23,Kingslaay,Different style and left field,7,18 December 2019,"The Love Witch was quite an interesting and different sort of film. Hard to describe or put into words what it is watching it. So much is bizarre and intriguing at the same time. The female witches are beautiful creatures capable of all kinds of spells and magic. One in particular is focused on love but goes about it in an unusual way. One could say one of the lessons is magic will only go so far, true love cannot be manufactured. Magic led to damage and the loss of life and sanity yet we are taken in by this strange and unusual Witch. Even among fellow witches Elaine stands apart.",The Love Witch
24,larrys3,Just Doesn't Work,2,15 March 2017,"This fantasy tale just didn't work for me on any level. It is highly erotic and colorful, perhaps bordering even on resembling a soft porn flick. I imagine much of it is intended to be a tongue-in-cheek fantasy film but almost all of these intentions fell quite flat, in my opinion.Samantha Robinson stars here as Elaine, who after a troubled marriage becomes a witch and begins to utilize erotic potions on men in the hopes of finding true love, but all it leads to is disastrous consequences. In my opinion, this movie came across as being quite anti-male, utilizing many male stereotypes. There's tons of nudity in the film, an explicit sex scene, various erotic seductions, plus a couple of rather gruesome bloody scenes as well.Overall, the movie, written and directed by Anna Biller, can be sumptuous to look at but it never came together for me as anything more than that.",The Love Witch

The colours were vivid, the dialogue was at times absurd and an endless supply of victoriana; the movie could be set in Transylvania but everyone would drink tea and speak the Queen's English. This is the essence of The Love Witch, a parody of all things Hammer, not as some might think Italian giallo. The trouble is the humour, even to those in the know doesn't last and the story isn't worthy of even a poor Hammer production. Nice try but the end result is mediocrity.",The Love Witch

27,rockman182,Th Love Witch (2016),7,5 February 2017,"I still can't believe this film was made in 2016. I only just heard about the film today but thought it was right down my alley. I love films that are innovative in style and films that pay tribute to an earlier decade. The Love Witch is about a femme fatale-esque woman who tries to find true love. She gives men potions that make them fall in love with her. Things usually take a turn and they end up dying somehow. It can be said this film offers more style over substance but sometimes it doesn't act as much of a detriment to the film. I feel like that is something that applies here.Anna Biller calls back to the 60's with films of the Technicolor era. You won't even realize that this film was made last year. Everything from the camera techniques, picture quality, costume design, background music, and even the acting make you feel like you are watching a B grade campy, erotic, horror film. If you pay close attention though, you will realize the film is actually set today. Its a fantastic presentation of an earlier era. The shots are full of color, almost Argento-esque and its an absolute joy to look at. All the technical aspects of the film are really a giant reason as to why this film should be seen.Samantha Robinson is gorgeously convincing as a flirty modern day witch. She is alluring to look at all the way through. She's a sexy character but in control of her own destiny. She controls the men she hooks up with. This is actually a strongly feminist piece, despite the film involving stripping, scantily clad appealing women. Sometimes the themes are a bit too overt and on the nose but it's not really a problem (mostly because I'm obsessed with the visual beauty of the film and was distracted by it).The film clocks in at 2 hours and the film feels like its length. The first hour is great. I'd say around the time Elaine meets the detective and goes to the renaissance fair we get a bit of fluff and padding story-wise. It's not too big of a problem although the film is very aesthetic so I don't think the film will be for everyone. However, if you are a film lover like me I think you will appreciate the sexy look of erotic B-movie madness on display.7.5/10",The Love Witch

There really isn't even joy, so they couldn't be laughing with joy. Then there's the whole idea of a woman needing to be married to be happy. That play marriage at the fair, during which the ""groom"" acted so happy but he actually hated the idea of marriage, so why was he so happy to play wedding?

This was not a horror at all. It is save to say if a bid had to have a label for this movie to go into, it would say ""Other"". They did the 60's/70's beautifully and that was about it. When Trish used her new age phone to call Elaine, I rolled my eyes.

Elaine (Samantha Robinson), is a beautiful young witch determined to find the man of her dreams to fall in love with her. She lives in a gothic Victorian apartment complete with a laboratory where makes spells and potions, then picks up men and seduces them. But her spells work too well, leaving her with a string of dead victims. This movie embraces the camp of 1960s horror, and explores female fantasy and the repercussions of pathological narcissism. Director Anna Biller is a feminist filmmaker whose take on cinema is influenced by feminist film theory. She also wrote, edited, produced, and scored this bizarre movie, which goes beyond camp to ignite the pulpy surfaces of its tale and produce a smoke of bad-dream sexiness and scariness. Does it succeed? Well there's a lot going on, and it does kinda threaten to collapse under the weight of all of it's individual layers, meaning like a lot of the Love Witches unfortunate victims, this is not a potion fit for everyone, but for a select few looking for something different, the movie offers up some powerful magic.",The Love Witch

I felt it would most likely have an empty plot and a poor sense of humor, but I could not have been more wrong. It's actually a complete genre masterpiece.It's one of the most loyal replications of the editing, cinematography, aesthetic, and acting styles of psychedelic films from around 1963-1973. And it's lead actress Samantha Robinson is absolutely stunning, absurdly captivating, and her beauty and seduction bleed right through the screen. I guess writer/director Anna Biller did the majority of the set design herself too?! Everything about this movie impressed the heck out of me. It's a ton of fun. Wow. Wow.

33,coreyjdenford,Love is a beautiful thing,8,7 March 2017,"This review of The Love Witch is spoiler free**** (4/5)""WHAT YOU CALL love is a borderline personality disorder...or worse."" If there was ever an awards season like the Oscars for originality in horror, then The Love Witch's writer-director and editor Anna Biller, will take every category home with her. It presents itself like a 1960s-70s film that happens to be coming out this year, its delivery is Stepford Wives but its execution is off-kilter indie and it's wonderful. Biller's love for art is clear here presenting her main character Elaine (Samantha Robinson), whose favourite colour is red driving down the freeway in her red convertible, talking about her life and love in a timely narration giving the audience an unblinking eye. Her story is simple yet exceptional, we learn within the first few minutes' film that she had a husband who adored her, but after his death she was resurrected as a love witch. She has strong emotional feelings towards men, she even has a dream of finding her prince charming, having a garish wedding and riding into the forest on a unicorn. She's essentially a counterpart into the family values of 1987s The Stepfather, pointedly making her fantasies almost become realities. She finds a lot of men in her journeys, there is a technique which Elaine uses, she seduces men by using sex and love spells by mixing fruits and hallucinogenic herbs which she just happens to be carrying in her inventory, along with her 70s-esqe bric-a-brac. You have to credit Biller, for populating her character with a heart for men but also giving her emotional heft, only few actors can deal with the depression of losing someone close to them and give brazen performances it looks here that Biller had her heart set on Robinson. Who looks the part with her lavish apartment covered in her paintings of 'brutal love' but also dressing up in transparent clothing and flawlessly looking like a fluorescent pink princess from the 1960s (which Biller also designed). The film's concept sounds simple enough, and it is, but there is a bigger picture as Elaine soon finds out that love cannot be forced or going by the soundtrack which Biller wrote ""Love is a beautiful thing."" Sure there is a lot to take in but each scene is exceptionally lavish, each moment is pulled through an excellent degree of goodness yes; it's weird but with something this good there's just no turning away.However The Love Witch isn't perfect, there is a flaw, there is a beautiful pictured mock medieval wedding scene that outstays it's welcome, but other than that it's fair to say that this film couldn't be timelier and what a time to come out.VERDICT: Aesthetically colourful, beautifully presented and artfully mastered.

34,youngcollind,"Pitch perfect visuals, imperfect storytelling",7,21 September 2021,"It can't be overstated how visually stunning this film is. Obviously an homage to the films of the 60s/70s, it is amazingly detailed in it's recreation of the period. Everything from the film, to the lighting, to the set design, to the effects, to the costumes, right down to mannerisms of the actors, has been painstakingly crafted, mostly by the multi talented Anna Biller, to be unmistakably authentic to the era. This technical feat cannot be overlooked. Outside of this though, the actual story in the film leaves something to be desired. Essentially boiling down to a beautiful quasi witch who chews through men on a quest for love. It's a pretty simple premise to digest, and it bumps through some slow bits and redundancies that weigh down it's impact. While the feminist undertones are evident and admirable, I may be too much of a knuckle dragging man to be overly impacted by them. There may be some truth to not letting the director also be the editor, but Anna Biller has otherwise done such an amazing job wearing so many hats that it's easy to forgive.",The Love Witch

36,scythertitus,Cursed,6,20 February 2017,"The thing to keep in mind about this film is that it might be entirely satire, like Black Dynamite, where the acting/writing/directing/story and effects are all bad purposefully as a homage to the cheap grindhouse movies they are styled after. However, whereas Black Dynamite is pretty on the nose about this satire, presenting things that are clearly meant to be bad, this film gives less away and never really winks at the audience to let them know that the people behind it aren't just nuts who are legitimately obsessed with the sexploitation movies of the 60s and 70s.There are little hints like music not matching and just simply a lot of scenes that are generally ludicrous, and if it is the case that the whole film is a satire on these movies, then it is pretty accurate and well done. If all of this tacky terribleness is by design then not only does the film perfectly emulate these trash movies in style, but also in tone and content, right down to purposefully terrible acting by the lead when her facial expressions almost never match the mood they are supposed to convey.This is where things get complicated, because as well as most likely being a satire of these movies, it is also an essay on the unevenness of gender politics, although its exact conclusions on the subject escape me. There are mixed messages abound that are at once aided and hindered by the faux cheesiness of the style. When the lead actress conveys what are meant to be looks of lust with instead looks of disgust, this could be interpreted as a commentary on the dual nature of love and desire, or it could just be a pointless joke about the actresses in those movies being terrible, hell it could be both! This film either has too much going on or not enough and it is impossible to tell. I would say give it a watch since it is certainly interesting if nothing else, but it probably could have used a bit more signposting to let the audience know exactly what its aims are.",The Love Witch

39,ReganRebecca,Campy throwback masterpiece,8,7 March 2017,"I still remember the first time I saw stills for The Love Witch. I was shocked I'd never heard of this 70s film... until I checked the release date and realized it was a 2016 film. First things first: director Anna Biller is an absolute genius. She not only directed the film but also made the sets and costumes and edited the film herself, assuring total creative control. The film really looks and feels like a complete camp 70s throwback and that's absolutely due to the behind the scenes care Biller but into her masterwork. The film's titular Love Witch is Elaine (Samantha Robinson), a young woman who mysteriously departs San Francisco after her husband Jerry ""left"" her (the film reveals in flashback that Jerry actually died). Elaine is desperate for love and believes if she subjugates herself completely by cooking and being the perfect woman, that she will eventually earn the love of her ""prince"". Elaine also practices witchcraft and uses potions to try and get the men in her life to love her. But once they do and become weak, needy and dependent, she finds them repulsive and can't wait to get rid of them. This is a film that wears its influences on its sleeve (seriously, there is a whole scene in a bar where the thesis of the film is basically discussed by the characters). But that doesn't make it weak. Instead the whole thing is incredibly tonely consistent. This wouldn't typically be my type of thing, but it's impossible not to watch and come away with great respect for Biller as an artist and filmmaker in complete control of her own vision.",The Love Witch

She creates potions and tries to induce Love for her in the men she bewitches but it never works out as she hopes.The Love Witch is a quirky movie, to put it mildly. There's this romantic 60's retro-thing going on with the look and feel and then we also have a kind of time warp perspective on the roles of the sexes. Overall, it feels a bit muddled and doesn't quite manage to be as charming or clever as it could be but it is enjoyable for the most part.It feels more Russ Meyer and early Roger Corman than Roman Polanski. At times I felt I was watching a classic Star Trek episode even. This is its main selling point but the idea wears out eventually and we're left with a bit of a thin plot, albeit with some nice stereotypical genre characters who are played well respectively. I should also add that it is perhaps a bit too long for its own good.I can see this movie having a strong cult following but probably for the wrong reasons.

Screenshots of the film rule the feed of the wannabe witches of social media. I finally got the chance to watch it today and it's quite an experience.We'll start with the positives and the main reason I gave this 3 stars. I like the costume design, set design, the film filters. It's done up to look like a film from the late 60's - early 70's. Even starts with the ""filmed in CinemaScope"" logo but with a ""creepy"" twist. I love the actresses' makeup all throughout the film. However just like the main character, the film is pretty to look at but there's nothing else to offer beyond that.The story had promise but it was comically executed. Like everyone else who watched this, I'm wondering if this was intentional or they really can't act. The only actor I saw give effort in his performance was the African American detective who was trying to catch the main character. Wasted effort on his part though, guess he counts for the three stars. If the director's intention was to make this as cheesy as a B movie from the 60's or 70's then they succeeded.The dialogue is hilarious. No one talks like that. Nearly every line delivered had me laughing, not cos it was meant to be comical (I don't think it was) but from how bad it was.

43,ryanpersaud-59415,"Weird, Sexy and Unbelievably Cool Looking",8,14 November 2021,"The Good: This is one of the most visually striking and memorable films I have ever seen. The Love Witch resembles the films of the 1960s and 70s, but not by digitally created film grain or anything lame like that. It's the set design, the costumes, the editing, the cinematography. It's the warmth of the film grain and the pacing of the story. The way the characters speak and act reminds me of low budget erotic horror films from the era. Every frame is teeming with color, interesting visuals or something to notice. It's just an awesome movie to watch from a style standpoint and one I'll recommend to film nerds for that alone.Samantha Robinson is awesome in this movie; she's funny, creepy, infuriating, sexy...all at the same time. You totally buy her weird character from the get go; as odd as her decisions are, I understood why she made them, and that's all that's really necessary.This is a pretty political film, and it isn't subtle about it. But, for once, I think this is an asset and demonstrates a good understanding of the mid-60s/early 70s. The feminist politics of the time were quite concerned with sex and sexuality and challenging norms in the context of relationships. The politics weren't subtle at the time, and this film NAILS that.I also have to applaud this film's audacity. It's so weird and unconventional, that I just have to appreciate the filmmaker's bravery to make it the way she wanted. It's not accessible for the sake of it and avoids contemporary Hollywood anachronisms that we see time and time again about the 60s.The Bad: That being said, this movie makes the unfortunate decision to effectively confirm that it takes place in the modern day. We see a character call using a cellphone, 2000s era cars and hear about ""DNA"" testing. Frankly, it sucks. The entire movie presents this odd revision of the past - where witches seem to be a part of society - and then just ruins it with anachronisms. I honestly wish they didn't do this, because I'm sure it took basically everyone out of the movie.But this isn't The Love Witch's biggest problem. While I appreciate the use of an untraditional, dream like narrative, the film lacks the meat and potatoes of an impactful story. The plot seems looser than it needs to be, the characters don't seem to act quite right for the situations they're in, which can be quite frustrating. (I get this is part of the presentation, if anyone's watched a movie from this era, you know this is common) There are some meandering scenes that sort of just end abruptly...and it takes away from the film. Unfortunately, substance loses out more often than I'd hoped.The Ugly: The Love Witch isn't for everyone; it has a lot of sex and nudity, a dreamlike vibe and frank conversations about men and women that may make people uncomfortable. There's also a scene towards the end that might...um...not be great for everyone to watch. But, if you're fascinated by the aesthetic of the era, want to see something unique and different, give this one a shot. We need more movies like this.",The Love Witch
44,derek-duerden,Why all the hate?,8,22 December 2018,"I loved this film and, given all the comments here, I am not alone - but there are also quite a few along ""worst film ever"" lines.
I guess this comes down to taste and preferences, but in my view the amount of love and care that has gone into the making of this film comes across very clearly in almost all aspects and I'm sure that Anna Biller and Samantha Robinson must be very proud of the result.
Suspend any disbelief and just go with it - in my view this kind of fun is what films are for.",The Love Witch
45,pcsarkar,One word: Surreal,8,13 December 2017,"I don't exactly recall what I was expecting when I saw this film. Horror? Soft porn? Witchery? or Nothing? Anyway, the movie rolled on the frail shoulders of the lead actress, Samantha Robinson. The sets were colorful, the period setting confusing.. (we see 70s style cars and costumes.. we see someone holding a 90s style cell phone), the props were Barbie Dollish and the overall plot was simple, but confusing. And yet, the movie as a whole was eye-popping, from Samantha Fox, sorry, Robinson, to the lush backgrounds, the sex scenes and a subtle message. This message, although lost in the general atmosphere of sex and wiccan rituals, was that in modern society, men and women are moving apart from each other, failing to understand each other, and becoming bored with each other. Why? Because neither sex, particularly the females, make any attempt to understand their male partners. Now this premise may not be palatable to feminists, but I subscribe to it. There is nothing wrong with the two sexes cooperating with each other, rather than competing with each other. And this message is sought to be brought out by Anna Biller - who has apparently created this surreal masterpiece on her own, on a tight budget. Kudos to her. The treatment had several loopholes, no doubt.. but why discuss them. Let the viewer discover them on his own. My favorite sequence was not of Samantha in her lingerie, rolling about on a pentacle.. it was of her renaissance style wedding, which fully brought out the pagan practices of the wiccans in detail and the fantasy elements of the film as a whole.My personal compliments to Anna Biller for her painstaking efforts in bringing forth a lost era with such cinematographic detail.",The Love Witch
46,axapvov,Drowning in Estrogen,7,26 January 2018,"It´s been said, ""The Love Witch"" is technically brilliant. The imitation of older genre films is perfect. It´s not only the visuals, the scenery or the costumes, the sound design is just as good and every single character seems to be taken from another era. Even transitions from scene to scene are excellent. Anna Biller has a complete understanding of the movies she wants to emulate. It´s almost witchcraft.From a feminist standpoint, it isnt´t subtle. I´m not sure if it should be taken entirely serious. I find it deceitully simple, though, and quite clever but it does at times seem taken from another era as well. The truth is i don´t get it completely. This film, feminist or not, is certainly feminine. The most feminine film I´ve ever seen. It´s a woman´s art, a woman´s idea, a woman´s everything. It´s absolutely drowning in estrogen.The question is, if ""The Love Witch"" was actually a late 60s film would it be any good? I have no idea but I´m guessing it´s irrelevant. Revivalism is a crucial element. It uses older esthetics to prove a point now. The comedy works better in a 21st century context. It might be too long and slow, I´d recommend watching it in the morning, not a popular time to watch movies but a lot films work better that way, and this is definitely one of them.",The Love Witch

In all honesty it felt like it was quite disrespectful towards women in general. I did break a laugh here and there but of awkwardness...However one thing to realise is that the movie is set in modern times, it isn't the 1970's. For whatever reason the people in the movie behave like they are in the 1970's alongside people that are not, including mobile phones and latest modern cars. This means that no you won't see 1970's bushes as someone pointed out.

53,pseawrig,Intriguing but a Little Too Too,5,19 September 2019,"This movie's central story of a beautiful witch whose hunger for love drives her to dish out love potions, which variously drive unsuspecting men to their deaths, is clever. Also, the movie looks great! Its retro-sixties fashions captured with a vibrant technicolor gloss are eye-popping. So are the film's notable set pieces, such as the protagonist's garish Tarot themed apartment, her favorite anachronistic tea room, and her participation in more than one witch's sabbath. All of this really works!Unfortunately, this movie's direction and script don't rise to its premise. The tone seems much too arch, in a nothing-matters-and-what-if-it-did kind of way. As a result, the characters feel remote, and there is practically no drama. This severe de-dramatization appears to be purposeful. The dialogue is ridiculously exclamatory, and the actors deliver it as if they are about to wink into the camera. Lots of critics seem to love this super meta story telling style. Imo, it's a little too twee. Too bad. It would have been really fun to be dramatically engaged by a cinematic world that looks this kinetic.Btw, the script trades in some pretty silly pseudo-feminism. Several critics apparently see the movie as a critique of patriarchy: you know, patriarchy's warped gender norms have created the love witch. Maybe. To my way of thinking, this movie is a little too concerned with artifice to be very serious about anything, much less to be a serious critique. But, hey, it looks amazing!",The Love Witch

There is little plot with nothing resolved by the end. Felt like they left it open for a part 2 which I would never watch. You are just glad this too long of a movie finally came to an end. While there is a bit of nudity, the two female leads are never truly nude. There is a scene with a number of men & women completely nude with full frontal, yet the two female leads have their breasts covered by their hair and wearing bottoms. It just seems so out of place to the point it's distracting from what is going on. There is no reason I could recommend wasting two hours watching this movie.",The Love Witch

Even so, this story is actually set in present day, occasionally you will see a smartphone and a modern BMW among a few other things. I would rather seen that the movie was set in early 70s since it looks and feels very retro. When it comes to the story it suffers from a mediocre script , and it's just a little too lengthy, they should had kept it at 90 minutes, not 120. The acting comes of for the most parts as awkward, except the star of this movie the love hungry witch Samantha Robinson she absolutely nails it in this femmen fatale role. But overall, The Love Witch comes of as more style than substance, it a gorgeous movie for us who loves the retro style, but it's definitely not a movie for everyone, probably only a very few.

58,Uwontlikemyopinion,Weirdest Feminist Movie Ever,5,3 April 2018,"Elaine (Samantha Robinson), a seductive witch, moves to California to start life anew after her husband dies. But something's amiss about the husband's death, foul play might be a reasonable culprit. Quickly, we figure out that poor Elaine is a complete psychopath (or is she a sociopath). Also, the men in her life can't get enough of her vivacious sexuality, at least they get their just desserts afterwards.I want to love this movie, but my intellect and emotions are at an impasse to enjoy this movie. Emotionally, ""The Love Witch"" imitates exploitation pictures from the 60s and 70s (it's so-bad-it's-good), specifically sexploitation (and Mario Bava movies). There's more than meets the eye, Anna Biller (the director) accomplishes in spoofing feminism and, more importantly, the male gaze (think of all the voyeuristic shots of Elaine dancing and sitting in lingerie). The film criticizes masculine behavior by warping the femininity of Elaine to cheap tawdry sleaze that only men can consume which removes her femininity. Meaning, everything turns on it's head when femininity is achieved by her victims and Elaine must either leave or destroy that feminine maturation. Essentially, this film embraces the changing perspectives of gender and sexual politics within men and women all the while being self-aware. That's no mean feat from Anna Biller who directed, wrote, produced, edited, and designed the sets and costumes. Intellectually, Elaine battles her desire and the way love appears in real life. Several films have examined this plight from ""Leave Her to Heaven"" (I wish I could find this movie) to ""Black Narcissus"" to the feminist masterpiece ""Jeanne Dielman."" To me, these films are more insightful and have a lasting impact. Scenes in the movie drag from slow-pacing to narrative structural problems. Obviously, this film's humor is an acquired taste with constant cheesiness which detaches me from the narrative and truly engaging with the material. Although the director loves her material from this story, a different editor could of helped with overlong moments and unusual pacing. While some may fall under ""The Love Witch's"" spell, I didn't.",The Love Witch

But then I started to notice the modern sedan that one of the characters drove. It wasn't meant to be on that era. That's strike one. I thought to myself that I should still give this movie a go for the effort they've given. So I kept on watching it. But then along the following scenes, I realized that this movie isn't just adopting the old days fashion style. But also the way actors and actresses have done their so called acting in the early days. Which is robotic, corny, cheesy, and kind of over the top. That's strike two. Yet even though I was bombarded with the type of acting that I hate the most, I still thought that this movie isn't that bad. That maybe it would get better halfway through. Boy, was I wrong! The movie kept showing amateur sex scenes with such unnatural reactions and over the top gasps and moans. It feels like I'm watching a 70's soft core porn that's only meant to tease me without giving any real satisfaction of a porn. And that's strike three. Which is exactly why I only gave it a 4 stars.

71,Style_is_Substance,Artistic Aesthetic and Muddled Messages,5,15 March 2017,"The Love Witch is apparently supposed to parody/mimic technicolor melodramas and stories from pulp magazines, but it seems as if it follows a certain aesthetic so closely that it doesn't seem to offer any insight or perspective into the aesthetic itself. As a result, it gets old pretty fast. I have read that some people find the film to be pro-feminist; I could see it as pointing out flaws with the patriarchy but that's about it. Every grain of feminism within the film comes across as incredibly shallow. The film allows itself to have an excuse to be shallow and basic, however. The film sets itself up with a defense mechanism so that it can avoid criticism, as people can respond with ""It's part of the aesthetic."" I don't really see anything particularly funny, and definitely not empowering about using satanism as a plot element, especially one for laughs. One doesn't have to be religious to agree that human sacrifice, including infant sacrifice, is evil. The film does not feature infant sacrifice, but it does reference human sacrifice and depict a glamorized version of witchcraft in a campy manner. The film is so messy that it seems like it is making women out to be works of the devil. One could easily respond to me and say ""you don't get it, you are missing the point, it is the exact opposite of what you are saying. It is satire."" If this is the case, what is the subject of satire, with what means is it satirizing the subject, and what is the purpose of it satirizing in this manner? I would say that by subverting relatively outdated tropes and aesthetic while being campy and humorous isn't all that far from the realm of satire. Taking the viewpoint of the femme fatale in this case just leads to muddled politics regarding women rights. There is nothing particularly empowering about Elaine that isn't synonymous with evil. The film seems to suggest women are also inherently evil and the road to achieving equality is by harming the oppressive gender. I would say that even though I don't really care for the film at all, it is one that may call for some interesting discussion.",The Love Witch

77,Exeter79,Feminist hate: men just deserve to die,4,27 August 2019,"""The Love Witch"" counts as another production carrying out explicit messages of radical feminist hate and male bashing. The leading character in this movie is a beautiful witch who creates love potions and uses them to make all men in a small town fall desperately in love with her. The results are disastrous, as all the men, who are already married, go crazy and in the end die, either by committing suicide, or by stroke and other apparent accidents.Behind the idea of maybe critizing the hypocrisy and conventionality of middle-class marriage and family (do we still need that in 2016? I mean, both have been in a deep crisis for the last 30-40 years at least), the witch is making clear statements, predictably blaming men for preventing women from living their lives in freedom blah blah blah. Judging from her actions, it would seem that freedom means going around having sex with any married man in the neighborhood.What is worse, the only man in the movie who resists the witch and tries to put some reasonable limit, like for example arresting her, since he's the town's sheriff, gets stabbed to death by her. The end of the movie portrayes the witch as a heroine, and the poor sheriff as a monster who well-deserved to be murdered. His unforgivable guilt is, first of all, not responding to her love interest. I found some similarities with this year's ""Midsommer"": if you are not what women want you to be, you must die. Women need freedom to do whatever they want to do, men don't.A pity, because the movie is beautifully shot and the actress strongly reminds of classic Italian 1960's/70's celebrity Edwige Fenech.",The Love Witch

I carried on watching. Carried on watching for the whole 2 hours. Even though I had enough at about an hour in.OK, let's talk good points. The film was absolutely stunning to look at, with beautifully rich, vibrant colours and a good looking cast. Yes, it certainly had that homage feel to it. A little bit of 60s, but mainly 70s. It looked and felt like it could've been a lost Hammer film, recently restored to its full glory. Really nice set pieces and costumes. Even a touch of a eurotashy type score. Even the acting, as its meant to be, nice and cheesy. They had that spot on, if indeed it was meant to be a homage or actually set in the 70s (I'll come back to that later). That's really all the positives I took away from it. You could say it's style over substance. Anna Biller certainly tried to add something of substance in there which just ended up being one long joke. A very long, 2 hour joke. First of all, let's touch on the 70s vibe, remembering that I've only seen the one trailer (I don't watch many trailers or clips for the same film due to the amount of disappointed when watching the film) and read no other reviews, till that 10 minute mark anyway. My first gripe and probably the major one, with the way the movie looked and felt, if you're going to make a film so overpowered with a 60s/70s feel then set it in the 60s/70s. Seeing a very small amount of modern cars mixed in with all the old (the opening scene - the police car. Shortly after - the BMW pulling up outside the house) ""classic"" cars really throws off that feeling.The other and only issue, a big one as a whole. The whole film was one big kick in the balls to men by a female director that's clearly one of these modern third-wave pseudo feminists (that's had a few bad experiences, but don't worry, her and her 10 cats will live happily ever after together)! Quite frankly it ruined the film turning it into, one big joke. It ended up being a 2 hour long feminist propaganda film. It ended up being a mess, not deciding what it wanted to be. A Pagan Witch film? A Hammer film? A homage film? Set in present day film? A sexist film? A feminist's wet dream? It's ended up being nothing more than a spoof.You can read my full review on Maven's Movie Vault of Horror.",The Love Witch
81,AaronDSimpson,Message Undermined By Delivery,5,3 July 2017,"Even though our society has moved beyond a collective compulsion to burn at the stake, or drown in the nearest body of water, the women who intimidate or confound us, it is still commonplace in our language to discuss femininity in terms of magic and sorcery. One needs only think of the amount of times that we have been described a romance as synonymous with falling 'under a spell', or, the amount of times that dalliances have soured and relationships described as 'curses'. Considering the ease with which these bromides occur in our discourse, it comes as no surprise that Feminist director Anna Biller should want to investigate the seriousness of taking this terminology at its linguistic value.For example, in Elaine (Robinson) - the eponymous 'love witch' - the viewer finds a young woman that wants only to love and be loved in return. However, a bad experience with her ex-husband Jerry (Wozniak) leaves her with a broken heart and in doubt of men's capacity to love. Elaine turns to magic, using the comfort of Tarot and the structure of other practitioners to re-establish a sense of order in her world turned upside down. Believing, as Biller does, that men can only go so deeply into love and struggle to substantiate lust with emotion, Elaine begins to use 'sex magic' to create 'love magic'. She quickly realises, however, that her magic is too strong and that the combined agency of her eros and her philia is too much for the, newly-dubbed, weaker sex and causes their deaths. Through these interactions Elaine becomes something of a serial killer, dispatching each man that she encounters with the intensity of her love. It is often unclear throughout the film how responsible she is for the deaths. Whilst it is true that she gives Wayne (Parise) a homemade alcoholic concoction including hallucinogenic herbs which contribute to his expiration, it is presented on the screen that his death was the fault of his inability to contain the complex emotions he was developing for Elaine. It is not until her final victim, the police officer investigating the trail of deceased men, Griff (Keys), that her murderous inclinations are exposed, as she drives a knife into his heart in ritualistic homage to the painting that she has on her bedroom wall.The message that Biller has for us through The Love Witch is a potent one, and Elaine is a figurehead for the conflicted woman of the twenty-first century, both an empowered female, yet one in possession of ingrained misogynistic discourse. Biller demonstrates that men criminalise and fear women for their sexuality and their self-empowerment in much the same way as witches were centuries ago, and shows that women can use their oppressed position to gain leverage; yes, provide men with what they want but in a way that allows you to engineer what you want from the situation.Whilst the director's criticism on gender relations is something to be taken seriously, it is difficult at times to view The Love Witch as more than satiric farce that undermines the seriousness of the film's subtext. For example, the film is full of all of the over-acting of a B-Movie compensating for a small cast and low production budget, extreme close-ups that create suspense in spite of the dialogue, pretending to drive cars against backdrops, gaudy sets and garish costumes, and sneaking phrases of Für Elise into the soundtrack. If it wasn't for the fact that Biller claims all aesthetic similarities to 1970s films were accidental, except for instances of lighting, then The Love Witch could be considered a masterclass in vintage framing. However, if these style choices were unintentional, it serves to suggest an instantly outdated quality to the film, or an unusual creative direction, that fails to appeal to a mainstream audience.There are many of us that have a secret passion for B-Movies, and could learn to appreciate the aesthetic that The Love Witch offers in the same way that we accept The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), only without the music, and everything according to the colour scheme of a Tarot deck. It seems likely that even fewer could appreciate the static characters, and the incongruous scene changes. Moving from a hard-boiled detective segment, to ridiculing the police investigating a 'witch bottle' and revealing that they have never seen a used tampon, to a medieval renaissance fair and mock-weddings, the film invites you on a roller-coaster ride of satire, whimsy, and independent scenes that would have worked better as sketches or as short films.One could argue that all of these characteristics were intentional and contribute to the symbolic meaning of The Love Witch; the shallowness of the plot to reflect the perceptions of women as superficial creatures, the episodic manslaughter to demonstrate the criminalisation of femininity during acts of self-empowerment, and the incongruous scene changes to create a sense of confusion and nonsense to comment on the representation of women in contemporary society. Whilst all these things may be true, and certainly should be factored when absorbing and meditating upon the film's message about gender relations, it does not constitute good cinema. It is difficult to be dismissive of a film that is clearly offering something important to society beyond the entertainment of Hollywood Blockbusters, and yet, what is the value of the message if the film is presented in a style that is unappealing to its audience?Read extended reviews like this at 'The Cineaste Review' on WordPress - thecineastereview.wordpress.com",The Love Witch
82,speakers,Sumptuous and bold,8,2 January 2018,"There are some excellent reviews on here, so i am only going to try and add to them and not repeat, nor will I go over the plot.To the casual viewer, the first impression may be that they are watching an old film, this is quite deliberate; the lighting, the colours, the make-up, all hark back to the 60s and 70s. Then someone pulls out a mobile phone or you notice that Trish is driving a modern BMW. The dissonance is striking and adds to the undercurrent of unease.The acting is very deliberate, much as it is in Twin Peaks; the subtext is not as convoluted as it is there, but it adds to the old-fashioned texture. Unfortunately, this causes a major miss-step when you can't tell if the acting is bad or if that's the way they were told to behave; I'm looking at you, crowd scene in the strip-club. Which reminds me, there is nudity in the film; really not sure why some people are making a bit deal about it, it's pretty innocuous.The overall theme is suffocating love, embodied in the glamorous form of Samantha Robinson, pitch-perfect as the horribly self-involved witch of the title, living in her insane fantasy life. She is ably supported in this by all the main actors and the director herself, who created the costumes, the amazing rug, the spell book and so much of the background.Maybe 2 hours is a little too long, but I really enjoyed this film and look forward to more from this director.",The Love Witch
83,dimi-05948,It's a good movie,8,16 May 2019,"But i find it very contradictory that the woman who plays the witch is very sexy and beautiful, why a woman like this needs witchcraft to find a man, when she can do it just standing still!? lol",The Love Witch
84,ThingsAreLookingUp,"Visually stunning movie, perfectly pays homage to the movies of the 60s, and an equally good story.",8,12 July 2021,"A masterpiece! If I hadn't known this movie was released in 2016, I absolutely would have believed it was from the 60s / 70s. This film is very beautiful visually, and very very well done! The actors, the costumes, the sets, the script and especially the way the film was shot are absolutely reminiscent of the time, I admire the sense of detail and the work provided for this film, especially the tributes to the great films of the time that were just as visually beautiful. I would also like to salute the talent of the lead actress Samantha Robinson, who in addition to being gorgeous, was exceptional! Her expressions and her way of speaking were just on point!",The Love Witch
85,sunintended,Great film but you need to appreciate the Director's intent.,9,17 February 2018,"This film is inspired by the glamour of past classics and tries to tackle the enforced masculinity of those films. It is a film for women to recognize the predicament of being a woman in a society mostly run by men for men.The woman is seen as a child, a Lolita, the other woman, the wife that cooks and
cares for the spawn of the man and finally becomes surplus to needs and finally a spinster.The man cannot see past his own biological needs which are embellished in culture and media because they sell so easily.Consider the man who preys on younger girls but then holds his own daughters due to their virginity. He protects them like possessions to be ""taken"" by another man.Consider the man who chases a girl, has his way and then decides she is not that great anymore.Women are a vessel for mens needs but they are so much more.Woman have their own needs, dreams and aspirations yet are forced to conform to this society of masculinity that is so flawed yet seems to be sustained.This film is an expression of woman and not popcorn chomping material.",The Love Witch
86,PatrickPlantana,A well done film loaded with 60's Nostalgia,8,9 September 2019,"Beautifully shot and very stylish! The entire realm of the feminine ideal is captured very well from multiple points of view. Various exaggerated characters and modern stereotypes shed light on these points in a comical and direct way. It also gives great examples of how differently men and women love and the vicious cycle that often incurs. A gorgeous female lead, plenty of sexual imagery, tons of homage to the 60's films of this genre, and a modern warning to narcissistic lovers and beta males alike all give this movie originality, with a familiar feel. Even some of the lesser acting adds to the style and love child era ""feel"" of this film. My only true complaint is that it tends to drag on a little bit too long. Still worth a look, especially if you like nostalgic cinema.SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONYou have the narcissistic, love sick maiden, Elaine, whom is the focal point of the story with an abusive past chronically seeking fulfillment in love. To no avail is she ever pleased through her turmoil of not knowing what she wants and losing interest once she gets what she believes she is after. Nothing anyone can give her is enough to fill her void, so she remains the hopeless romantic. A modern twist to the hopeless maiden is done here as she is a love potion, spell conjuring (slightly unstable) witch.I love how they portrayed the boring soon to be housewife who seems to share the mindset of most modern women who possess an air of entitlement and a lack of comprise within their relationship. The housewive's counterpart, the bored soon to be husband, is also well depicted as a successful, caring man who loves his wife, but feels he is missing something from their relationship. He bears a cross of being undervalued and neglected by his fiancee. A feeling most modern men undoubtedly experience.The traits of the two men that fall wildly in love with Elaine are deliberately over-exaggerated and drive the point home perfectly by demonstrating the hatred women have for weak men. You have two successful, motivated men with their lives in order until they fall head over heels for an enchanting woman. The first gentleman, Wayne, is a good-looking, intelligent, Casanova type that has typically done well to guard his heart from his multiple sexual encounters with women until meeting Elaine. Upon drinking her potion he turns into a sniveling, helpless beta male which Elaine immediately despises and finds bitterly unattractive. The second man (the bored husband) though a successful pilot, is for the most part a beta male at heart who settles for a safe, but unhappy relationship. After drinking her potion a wild affair with Elaine takes shape. He becomes fiercely in love with her and becomes sniveling and helpless once the Witch loses interest in him also.Elaine finally believes she has found true love in the white knight police detective that begins investigating her. A tall, well chiseled handsome alpha male. He begins a romance with Elaine and against his own judgements becomes temporarily distracted and blind to her madness. He has a brilliantly scripted epilogue during a scene with Elaine where he describes falling in love with a woman as turning a man weak and how men lose interest once a woman becomes more attached to him. He bluntly uses the term ""suffocating."" I found this part of the movie to have a strong feminist undertone trying to make men seem selfish and impossible to please. I'm not sure if the undertone was deliberately ironic, but I found it almost hypocritical as the leading character was deceptively manipulating men into falling in love with her only to discard them once they did, remaining unsatisfied once she got what she wanted. Again, I don't know if this was deliberately done to prove a point, but I found it interesting nonetheless. However, the police detective eventually does pull away from Elaine and sees her for who she truly is and sticks true to his alpha male nature by not falling for her tricks. My favorite scene hands-down is towards the end of the movie when he is scolding her in the bar and describes her perfectly, calling her out on her actions and mentality.One other character, only briefly shown throughout the film, is Elaine's ex whom she was passionately in love with. One particular scene seems to sum up the entirety of her attraction to him as you hear him being critical and rude to her about her looks and womanly duties. Saying quote, she ""needs to step it up"" in their relationship. This gives a perfect feel for how men perceive women as only going for the jerks or bad boy types (Alpha males), men that put them down and constantly make them chase their validation and hold them accountable for everything. This scene is immediately followed by the sound of her father's voice speaking to Elaine when she was (what I perceived to be) a child, cruelly poking at her weight and putting her down. Further proving the point that women who are abused or neglected by their fathers grow up with ""daddy issues"" and a fear of abandonment that they constantly struggle to fill with promiscuity, deception, obsessive love seeking, and codependency in relationships.Overall, I found this movie to be very well done between the beautifully nostalgic shots, the gorgeous lead that never gets tiring to look at, and a well written story filled with modern issues and perspectives on love, sex, narcissism, behavioral disorders, and feminism.",The Love Witch
87,Jane-doe66,Extraordinary,6,27 July 2020,"I dont think i would ever expect to see a movie made in 2016 to feel like it was shot in the 60s.

I don't know a lot about witchtcraft and i've never been really interested in that but i really loved the atmosphere and the visuality of the film. The cafe where they went to drink tea was my favorite location for sure, it was like a fairy tale. I think there was a lot of remarks about feminism. If i look at the story of the film i couldn't really get Elaine's story and the movie didn't really get to the point. I couldn't figure out Elaine's emotions towards the men she was with especially to Wayne. And the scene with her and Wayne in his house was unnecessarily long. But overall it was visually satisfying.

I was dead wrong and I'm happy about it. I didn't know this movie was lauded by critics and had so many enthusiastic fans. Somehow I feel validated. But enough of poor old me.
The Love Witch is cleverly composed and beautifully filmed. The colors have the bright, rich feel you never get in movies anymore. Anna Biller took great pains in making this homage to exploitation films, and really every frame shows. The acting is well paced and clever in that everyone captures the stilted awkwardness so common in these movies.
I think the movie works because it is a clever horror story delivered in an old school style, but still a good story.
I'm glad there are people willing to get out there and make movies like this.
Samantha Robinson is beautiful through and though in this movie. I have to note that.

.. and there lies the problem.. when one person does everything, unless they are a genius, there's no one to say ""hold on, this bit needs more work""Shot on film for the 60s aesthetic and designed to have the 60's look, that part is fine, but I think she's a poor writer and an average director.
I get that it's a pastiche designed to comment on how women *and men* are in these imaginary roles of knights on horseback and Disney princesses.
But big deal, there's nothing new in that and she doesn't make a funny/insightful/devastating commentary on any of it.One comment I read here suggests we are within the character's damaged mental state by the end of the film but it has no impact.

The story line was nothing special, but not bad. The actors did a fine job with the script. The witchy imagery was fun. There was a semblance of the standard ""be careful what you wish for"" moral in there too.The only real drawback was how 60s they went. I was reminded of Casino Royale (1967) or The Pink Panther (1963). The pacing was uneven, occasionally coming to a grinding halt so a character could give an extended monologue. There were plenty of long intervals of scenery and watching characters doing mundane things not really relevant to the plot, contributing to a long run time. There's plenty of style, but not much substance, so it can definitely become boring for someone who isn't going in with enthusiasm.Overall, a good watch if you're into movies about witches or movies from the 60s.",The Love Witch

96,d5454,A Sheep in Wolf's Clothing,2,22 December 2020,"I completely understand the appeal of a vintage style. ""The Love Witch"" achieved what it was trying to do with its homage to 60s-70s camp horror cinema. However, it was at the expense of a good product.This period of filmmaking was often cursed with horrible acting and writing, and as it happens, this movie also contained horrible acting and writing. It remains to be seen if that was actually the intent, or if the style was an attempt at covering up its flaws. At any rate, it simply did not work. Many sources claimed this movie was classified as a ""comedy."" It was certainly laughable, but I am positive that was not what Anna Biller intended. The humor was merely a side effect of a poorly conceived arthouse drama. Everything in ""The Love Witch"" was cringe inducing, right down to the themes. How could one make the statement that women are only good for their looks, and then shame men when they are not attracted to them enough? It is an impressive endeavor to preach both feminist ideals and a problematic contradiction to those same ideals, all at the same time. This movie was far from being as progressive and thought provoking as it intended to be. It was just brainless, and I would advise Biller to change her approach for her future work.",The Love Witch
97,johnnyrev,Witty and beautifully shot gem,9,27 February 2017,"I'm happy this time-culture clash exists. The Love Witch is a pitch-perfect pastiche of late 60s, early 70s exploitation movies. A witty examination of shifting attitudes toward gender politics, sexual relations and male-female desire from a vantage point 50 years on by a female director with an obvious affection/obsession for genre and a deep knowledge of the source material. Visually, the look and feel of the era's style of film is perfectly recreated. So much so, as I watched I sometimes had to remind myself that this was made only last year in 2016. The occasional (and very intentional) glimpses of modern cars parked on streets, and characters talking on mobile phones were, probably, intended to shake the viewer out of that particular delusion. Perhaps, this was a budget constraint cleverly used by Biller to the movie's advantage, as self-reflexive moments like these seem to serve as reminders of the artifice of cinema and cultural style.Although The Love Witch is a 'feminist' movie, it's not polemically scathing or mean-spirited. In fact, quite the opposite holds true. The Love Witch is gentle and playful; at times sympathetic and forgiving. It is often satirical and ironic and, on occasion, just plain bonkers and laugh-out-loud funny. The dialogue is suitably stilted and the cast's deadpan deliveries are in keeping with the straight/jokey dichotomy of the initial set-up. As for the design and look, Biller (who had several jobs on the crew) really does nail it. Sets, lighting, costumes, hairstyles, photography, editing, acting, story, script, soundtrack all converge and conspire to recreate several genres and sub-genres popular in their day. However, ultimately The Love Witch is more than just a nostalgic exercise in style. It's a playful tribute to genre movies that actually has quite a lot to say for itself.

People were sitting in the floor just to watch this film And around the balcony edges. Everyone seemed to love it and when the film ended people were clapping.

106,amberapple-1,Sumptuous Homage and Neo-Pagan Expose!,9,19 October 2016,"A young, beautiful witch moves to a new city in northern California in search of love..does a love spell to attract a man...befriends a woman and seduces her husband...and all havoc breaks loose! Sound like a cheesy 1970s horror flick? It is! In glorious technicolor! This film is downright visionary and beautifully made. Shot in gorgeous 35mm (who does that on a small budget these days?) with a wildly delirious color palette and painstaking attention to detail (well, there are a few modern cars in a few shots, but I forgave that against the rest of the film's visual perfection), this is sure to be one of the most talked about cinematography achievements of the year. Watching this homage to 1970s horror thrillers is very much like turning on a made for TV movie in 1974 or so: the pacing, the acting styles (somewhat stiff and arbitrary), the camera shots, the music, and the only anachronism I noticed apart from the cars was one character's use of a smartphone. This begs the question: were these anachronistic elements intentional? And if so, what kind of homage are we looking at here? But, the seamlessness of the gorgeous visuals aside, the film is also a fascinating take on neo- pagan spirituality (modern witchcraft and Wicca), with a surpassing amount of insider-derived knowledge of rituals, jargon and trappings. (Ask me how I know...) I have no doubt the film will cause some controversy in the pagan community, mostly due to people taking this as literal narrative and not a form of satirical commentary. Elaine is a fascinating character, at times seeming to be shallow and two-dimensional and at others very intricate and surprising. There's a great deal of subversive feminist messaging here as well, with clever references to iconic films like THE ACCUSED and THE STEPFORD WIVES, among others. Feminism is a central theme and yet dealt with in a very unexpected manner, seeming to celebrate stereotypes while simultaneously bashing them. I've seen the film a number of times and see something new with each viewing, as it has many layers of complexity. Definitely one of the year's, if not the decade's, most interesting films. A delightful addition to the horror genre.",The Love Witch

However, that was all as far as anything worth seeing, and let's face it, there are a ton of good movies out there with attractive women as well as men (for the women out there) who can actually act. I don't know - maybe with a better script, direction and production values things might be different. But the bottom line is that this movie was a waste of time that I never would have watched if not for the relatively high IMDb review score and the picture of the lead actress (Did I mention she is beautiful? But that isn't enough to carry this awful movie.). I recommend people avoid this film.",The Love Witch

Poor story and dialogue and I couldn't see any worth while point this film might or might not have been trying to make, I can't even say it falls under the umbrella of ""it's so bad its good"" or ""it's so bad its funny"".....

110,elanavital-70230,Disappointed! (from a real witch),2,26 March 2021,"I will preface this with the declaration that I am a practicing witch. This film theoretically was meant to show an insiders view of witch craft. Instead it comes off as a vintage show-and-tell of a woefully dismissive, skimming-the-surface summary of the craft wrapped in a blanket of pseudo nonfeminist-feminism and a terribly generalized view of gender. The visuals are glorious and there is no denial that Biller is a talented visual artist, producer and director. But her out-of-touch storytelling and point of view makes one wonder if perhaps she might be a one-trick pony; make a movie vintange, stylized, put on a tiara and white dress and ride that poor old Nostalgia pony into the dirt.Perhaps what ruined the film for me was learning a bit more about the creator's philosphical perspective in an interview. For sone reason, we're supposed to feel sorry for the witch ""who just wants to be loved""? After killing 3 people and intentionally ruining her friends marriage? Oh, but SHE'S not a killer, the men just died bed they ""loved her too much""...Egotistical wish fulfilment anyone?In the interview, Biller makes statements that ""ALL"" women want to be a femme fatale and ""ALL"" men are out of touch with their feelings...ridiculous generalizations of an extremely nuanced subject matter SOLELY based on Biller's personal evaluation of things. What about women who are attracted to women? Men who are attracted to men? People who are attracted to neither? There are women who have no desire to be a cold hearted 1970s suburban witch that controls, manipulates and demeans men. There are men who are in touch with their feelings and do great things for others. As for the references to witch craft, I was at first pleased with some of the fun factoids of spell work that Biller included (yes, witch jars are real and sometimes bodily fluids are used! Fun!), but after a while it got...BORING. I'm a witch myself, but I'm not here to listen to a 30 minute lecture on how energy work functions, or why evil men burned poor poor women at the stake for practicing witch craft and being a female (A historically inaccurate account, because many of the most brutal witch hunts were driven by politics and the accusations of other women!).Biller, WHY did you have to equate the craft with Satanism and baby killers? Did you want it to be an accurate depiction of witch craft or a freaky horror movie? Pick one, because in pretending to do both you just spread more misinformation about us. We've been trying to debunk that stigma since the Satanic Panic of the 80s. You can't brag about the film being based on real rituals then say we killed a bunch of babies for Satan. Just...please don't.I just wanted to watch a cool horror flick, and the only good kill is at the very end. And despite the pretty visuals, I got bored and annoyed at the ideology behind the story.The Love Witch starts out interesting but then becomes a long winded, confusing wish fulfilment self-insert (yes, Biller, I know how you like to feature a sexy, idealized version of yourself in pretty much every main role...Thought you could slip that one by everyone, huh?)Would have given only 1 star but I dig the actress.",The Love Witch
111,maubreyhampton,"The Love Witch is a powerful brew of politics, passion, art, philosophy",10,18 June 2016,"The Love Witch, by writer, director, editor, composer and designer Anna Biller will be the most unusual and exciting film you will be lucky to see this Summer. It is impossible to describe in the space allotted here, except to say that it is an allegory about being female in society cast in the guise of type of thriller. What makes the film so unusual is its serious and fearless project of using devices associated with classical Hollywood narrative and bringing them up to date in a way with themes that seem as applicable to today's 24/7 social media as any previous era. There are things in this movie that today's audiences are not used to seeing, everything from older lighting and acting styles, to rear projection, (special mention should be made of David Mullen, the cinematographer, who crafts a visual style that apparently has not been used in decades!) to carefully story boarded shots. A truly independent film in every sense, The Love Witch, though it does have humor and eroticism in it, is in the end a kind of tragic drama, whose intent seems to be to get we in the audience to think more for ourselves about matters of consequence. In fact the film is so dense that it is worth revisiting more than once. Everybody involved is excellent and the film's star Samantha Robinson should be one to watch. Her performance brings pathos as well as beauty to the film and helps us to actually identify with the kind of character who is not normally represented in either studio or or independent productions. I hope this film gets the widest attention and opens up an equally wide conversation about the cinema and life.",The Love Witch

114,mysticalfredo,Burn the Love Witch!,2,12 June 2016,"I recently sat down to watch the ""Season of the Witch"" for the first time. It's an early 1970's film by George Romero that follows the exploits of a bored, neglected suburban housewife as she becomes involved in a world of witchcraft and murder. It was an entertaining slice of its era, and could probably be described as an early-ish feminist horror film. With it fresh in my memory, I was looking forward to seeing 2016's ""The Love Witch"" - directed by Anna Biller - which seemed like a perfect companion piece. You could almost copy and paste the synopsis for ""Season of the Witch"" and substitute it for that of ""The Love Witch"", but instead of a suburban housewife, our protagonist here - Elaine, played by Samantha Robinson - is single, already a witch, and she wants a man. A perfect man. And she isn't afraid to use all the witchery in the book to get him, but things just seem to keep going wrong, and the men usually end up dead.On its surface, ""The Love Witch"" is a throwback to those bright technicolor melodramas of the 60's and 70's with occult themes like those in Romero's film. I'm not familiar with her previous work, but one look at Biller's filmography shows that she's made a habit of paying tribute to exploitation fare of the past, and visually she nails it.Shot on glorious 35mm, ""The Love Witch"" makes one hell of a first impression. The colors are vivid and absolutely striking. The costuming and makeup are dead on, invoking flashbacks to the 1970's more successfully than most films that attempt a retro look. The set design is wonderfully garish and when you realize that Biller herself did just about everything - from directing to writing, costumes to makeup, production design to editing - it's hard not to be impressed.I was totally on board at the beginning of the film. Elaine captures her first male victim in a long-winded but amusing sequence. There's a revealing, groovy sex scene, but the immersion is broken when you realize that the 70's bush is missing. Come on, the pubic hair should have been growing down their legs like gnarled thickets! And with an inexplicable lack of hair, things start to fall apart. The downward spiral begins.You begin noticing the strange on screen mix of vintage cars and brand new models. Is this the 70's, or some bizarre modern visual pastiche? Why? Things aren't quite gelling together as they should visually. There are a couple of shots that make use of the style and setting laid out so well in the first 25 minutes, but you can tell the production is quickly running out of steam.Then... it happens. The movie stops dead in its tracks for a long, drawn out scene of dialogue that does nothing to further the plot. In fact, at this point in the film, there IS no plot. There is no drive. The audience might as well go home. Everything creaks to a halt as we watch and listen to flatly shot, mundanely written yammering that means absolutely nothing to the story as a whole.I wanted to get my scissors out and trim this film for Biller. Sure, she's a one-woman cinematic army, wearing all the hats in the production - and I get that it takes a lot of effort to do that - but there's a reason why directors and writers aren't usually given the right to edit their work. I know, you wrote and you filmed all this stuff that in your heart is great, but you need to cut it down to make the movie watchable for us plebs. At two hours long, ""The Love Witch"" is disastrous.The script needs to be firing on all cylinders for this to work, but it never is. The proceedings are completely witless and droll. As the film drags the audience through long dialogue scene after loooooong dialogue scene, Elaine becomes insufferable. She really is a wretchedly selfish and unlikable protagonist. Her stilted, sedate line delivery and bemused look are frustrating to the point of disbelief, and the people around her wander through scenes like denizens of a poorly acted dream.Ostensibly, the film is about the hold that women have over men with their sexuality... but you know what they say? Beauty is truly skin deep and the old adage applies to the film as well. The appeal of the visual style wears out its welcome by the halfway mark and what started out as unique, vivid, colorful and endearing becomes ugly and distasteful. It's like eating too much candy - the first few bites are great, but after indulging too selfishly, you end up with a stomach ache, which is usually followed by projectile vomiting and violent diarrhea.About 20 minutes from the end, when you feel like the movie MUST be wrapping up soon, you're subjected to another long, tensionless dialogue scene, and it hammers home just how much time you've wasted watching this thing. When the end mercifully comes, it's mind- numbingly (and I hate to use the word) pretentious, but would you expect anything less after all that?Go and watch Romero's ""Season of the Witch"" instead. It's not his best work, but it's not... this.In closing, all I can say is... burn ""The Love Witch"".",The Love Witch

With its stylized technicolor palette and the glamorous looks of Elaine, much of the mise-en-scène is very satisfying. Despite this, I found the storyline to fall incredibly flat. The plot was incredulously slow and the messages on modern femininity were lost in poor pacing. At times the acting, which is meant to stylistically exaggerated, feels wooden and stiff.

It's a complete waste of time.The clothing looks homemade, the acting is almost none of the actors took any classes, the dialog is just pitiful... it's more 'we need girl power so let's make some drugs' No magic takes place. She literally is killing men, who adore her to begin with, in search of 'love'.This movie is crying out that modern day women need more power and to do so we need that perfect man in our life. When he doesn't work out, kill him. Meanwhile, the male witches, warlocks I guess, literally kiss the females feet. In Honor.Around 50min in, during the little witch get-together. She's suppose to be naked...you can clearly see the straps of her...strap on..even shows it up close getting her arms tied. Later, during another get together with more of the witches, and more naked people. You can't hardly see any strap ons. So, it's not an attempt to make it ""old fashioned"".

Horror movies where the subject matter is about the occult, magic etc. I dive into that stuff with as much of an open mind as I can muster.But the whole Wiccan thing, at least to me seems to be more of psychological dominance rather than anything. Who is in control? Can an individual reach out to *a* reason why they want, do, enact whatever because of sheer will? Will? Really?So we are re-telling the hubris thing again? A HUMAN with power that doesn't exist. At least not in the fictional manner of any narrative/production that yields it's self to us.But it is only cleverness, sexual appeal - and until argued and proven other wise, the average of Men, their sights on which turns them on is exactly that. They ""SEE"" what it is that a man acknowledges to himself that blood flows to one's genitals.Women ""CLAIM"" that they are more than that. ""Women"" claim that as long that the modern paradigm is a man's paradigm, they will always desire more and more.But that isn't the case so far in The Love Witch. At least that I can see so far, 33 minutes into the movie.So the copyright is 2016? But I am to believe it is nostalgia? An Era where Mork and Mindy is a brand new source eye-candy? Possibly a movie that was made shortly after The Sound of Music? Well, the movie succeeds in that regard. House of the Devil by Ti West aimed to do the same thing. It was a little more hyperbolic in recreating an era. Or a style. As if either of two films were made in an analogue fashion. I think The Love Witch succeeds in that aim.However, it is obvious that the film maker researched Cultish, Wiccan, Magic stuff as it is perceived in 2016. And the film maker nails in communicating what how magic can only be defined as. Making stuff happen by sheer will. It can be created out of no where because one wants it and wills it to be created.It is just done through logical means that takes not only space but time to create. But it isn't hocus pocus. It isn't saying abra cadabra nor any other incantation that creates and/or eliminates by holding one's arms out and believing it can be done without process.The moment I thought this movie was smart was when the main female who wants, desires - nay. REQUIRES to be loved. And then there is a so-called ""witch"" who literally uses a wig. Not a spell or charm. But within her own privacy, has to add a man-made manufactured THING. And then physically dawn it in order to stare at a person from across room and have them stop talking to a woman and direct their attention to someone else?Well, then that is a narrative worth exploring.

The acting and cinematography really subpar and reminding of some cheap, trashy 70's p*rn. Maybe it's because I'm a woman watching this and it seems quite the male gazey thing to watch but just like p*rn with a ""storyline"" there really is not much substance here except for a pretty, often nude girl.

It takes itself very lightly while managing to incorporate some thoughtful dialog about feminism and the symbiotic relationship men and women ideally have. Additionally, there is some amusingly dry tongue-in-cheek dialog along the way. The cinematography is a spectacle, a delightful feast for the eyes. Stylistically, the movie has a retro feel. The period is mostly ambiguous, as most of the main characters drive vintage cars, but in any given frame we see modern cars as well; nearing the end of the movie we see a cell phone for the first and only time. The story, although one-dimensional at times, is refreshingly simple. Elaine is a white witch who wants nothing more to find a man and be his every fantasy, utilizing the aid of some witchcraft in her search. That's the most one can say without spoiling anything. The movie, although paced fairly well, goes on a tad too long. If they could have dropped this movie down to 100 minutes, I think it would improve the experience.

129,cola-vision,Over the Rainbow with THE LOVE WITCH,10,20 March 2017,"THE LOVE WITCH (2016) Anna BillerOVER THE RAINBOW WITH THE LOVE WITCHElaine, played by the stunning Samantha Robinson, is seen driving along a sunny seashore landscape filmed with back projection recalling Melanie driving across the landscapes in Hitchcock's The Birds. She is pulled over by a cop along a lonely road that also recalls Psycho. With director Anna Biller referencing Hitchcock, she brings to attention the realisation that we are about to watch a 'film'.After arriving at a wonderfully creepy looking mansion and being greeted by Trish, played brilliantly by Laura Waddell, Elaine settles into her garishly decorated apartment. Later, alone at home and making a love spell, her repetitive cry of 'love me, love me, love me' signals that she feels a part of her is missing.Elaine soon meets Trish's husband Richard & Wayne a university professor where games of seduction soon follow. After meeting detective Griff does she finally feel she has met the man of her dreams.Shot on 35mm film, The Love Witch looks glorious with it's eye popping colours shot by cinematographer by M. David Mullen. Anna Biller not only designed the sets, made the costumes, wrote, produced and directed, but also scored some of the music and edited the film.The film's design evokes the feel of the late 60's and early 70's but functions in it's own Filmic universe. It is so far removed from the 'sexploitation' label sometimes given that references to Jess Franco, Russ Meyer or Italian Gialli is completely missing the point. These films rely on the male gaze and set pieces revelling in sex or violence which has little in common with the films of Anna Biller. The Love Witch has more in common with filmmakers like Demy with his clear colours, elaborate costume or to the subversive cinema of Buñuel. Also Sirk and Fassbinder for their classic melodrama and Hitchcock for his psychological character studies and beyond. Like the Pied Piper's hypnotic music, the films visual beauty is also it's deadly trap. This highly sensual illusion with it's shimmering textures and jewel like colours is a smokescreen that is both seductive and dangerous.If we are to believe that the pathological actions of Elaine are a result of an 'objectified abused woman', then the whole film can be viewed from another angle. From Elaine's sudden flashbacks to the satanic ritual scenes being stripped and ordered by the quietly creepy Gahan, played by Jared Sanford, to the strip teasing Elaine performs in front of her lovers, there is something slightly uncomfortable and out of place. Though Elaine seems to be in control it feels as if she is going through the motions with her body but not in mind! In one scene, Elaine during an erotic dance, takes her rainbow lined jacket off and hands it to her dizzy and lustful lover Wayne. Viewed from his point of view through a 'rainbow' filter, it gives the impression that Elaine is consumed by a hypnotic drug herself with rainbow colours swirling about her. The image of Elaine is further split into several images, by filming her through a kaleidoscope filter, that literally shows her with a 'fractured psyche'.Elaine's dissociation is further witnessed during the scene where Trish expresses her sadness in finding her own husband dead. Instead of showing any kind of genuine sorrow towards Trish, Elaine demonstrates an odd blankness, with the numbing of her emotions a further sign that she is suffering from some kind of trauma.These blank stares are also witnessed with the Gemini Twins, Moon and Star. They perform in an awkward erotic dance on stage like a single person split into two, a mirror image, again reinforcing signs of dissociation. The cheering and lustful men ignoring the women's oddness is also a sad reminder of some men's refusal to acknowledge women in mind, body and soul. The idea of transformation is also a fascinating insight into the film. At one point Trish, alone in Elaine's bedroom begins to take on the look of Elaine by donning a black wig and applying the same make up. In an attempt to feel and look like Elaine she begins to lose her own identity and for a brief moment of fantasy becomes another person. This could be seen as a reference to the transformations seen in Hitchcock's Marnie and Vertigo. The final scenes showing Griff refusing Elaine's love results in her exploding with the ultimate expression of rage and ridding herself of oppression by stabbing Griff to death. Suddenly reverting back to her earlier wedding fantasy with Griff, Elaine subconsciously escapes for a moment from her painful reality. We see Elaine led away by her prince on a white horse, the sadness in her face a reminder that her story is stuck in tragic dreamy limbo.If art is an expression of the artist then depending on how personal The Love Witch is to Anna Biller then incorrect criticisms and dismissal of the film's important themes could be viewed as a personal attack on the director herself and not the actual film! The Love Witch doesn't offer easy answers, but shows that the transforming of darkness into something positive is a cathartic process that can also offer viewers an opportunity to explore their own complexities. Not only made with care and passion and with a 'cinephiles' eye, it demonstrates the wonderful possibilities of what cinema can actually be. Combining dream logic in a sensuous fantasy world in which anything can happen, The Love Witch is a film where real emotions and psychological truths are presented with determined honesty. If you are willing to ride it's lustrous waves and explore it's darker themes then The Love Witch is a film that has much to discover and enjoy.Shaun Cola",The Love Witch

It was lovingly crafted on 35mm film, capturing the color and abstract nature of 60s and 70s Gothic Horror.
The score and sound design are an alchemy not seen in modern cinema in decades.
The director brought amazing, nuanced performances out of the actors that let the camp and comedic moments bloom, and caused the harrowing ending cut you to the quick.
My husband and I are cinephiles, that have dug deep into decades of film, and we've noticed a trend in the last 5 years we're calling 'Brave New World.' Movies in this class of cinema, look back lovingly at classic films while bringing a fresh, nuanced language that's so desperately needed.
I'd place this movie in that hallowed group, with others like A Most Violent Year, Lady Bird, The Florida Project, or the Shirkers, with a lighter yet just as meaningful touch.

135,naughtyneko,A Multifaceted Critique of a Society that is Failing Us All,9,15 January 2017,"The Love Witch is storytelling on so many levels, one watching of the film is simply not enough to take it all in. The premise is simple- a young woman, unlucky in love, seeks to turn the tables by invoking witchcraft to add to her considerable physical charms. By the end of the film, however, you realize that this story is really only the starting point.First, to really get the most out of the film, it is important to understand that it is operating on at least two distinct levels. Anna Biller does not so much ask us to suspend disbelief and join the characters for an immersive experience as she asks us to float over the top, watching the action unfold from an almost clinical position. Think of The Love Witch as a gloriously detailed dollhouse from the late 1960's or early 70's set up in an observation room behind a two-way mirror. A modern-day child is moving the dolls through the rooms, and it is our task to watch not only the story the child creates with the dolls- but the child herself. If you do this, parts of the movie that could otherwise be vexing fall into place. For instance, the anachronism that people have commented on- the juxtaposition of the very groovy 60's vibe and the modern cars and technology that creep into the frame more and more frequently as the film goes on- is not a flaw in the movie making or an indication of low budget. Rather, it is one ""level"" or reality of the story subtly intruding on the other. Things fall apart in The Love Witch from the perspective of the characters, but that is simply the action of the other reality manifesting on screen.The movie uses this device often to deconstruct the many themes it explores. Its treatment of witchcraft particularly makes use of the duality of narrative. In the ""dollhouse"", we see the characters acting out the scenes of ritual sacrifice and ""sex majik"", but the child moving the dolls occasionally turns to us with a knowing smile and says, ""Of course, I KNOW magic isn't real, and that it is actually the poisonous plants in the potion that are deadly. But still, isn't this fun?""The Love Witch isn't a movie filled with symbolism. It is symbolism made into a movie. Everything on screen, from Elaine's rainbow-lined dresses to the obvious foreshadowing-in-a-painting artwork is not meant to be a literal, functional object. It is a token in a dream, a stand-in for the thoughts and ideas that hum and flow just below the surface. In the end, this is a story about mental illness. It is about the illness of Elaine, the main character, and the reality she creates in order to survive the illness of society- an illness that is profound, complex, and ultimately overpowering. This is a movie about the toxicity of gender roles and unrealistic expectations. This is a movie about manipulation and rape and insecure attachment. This is a movie that asks us to be the clinicians, for us to diagnose and to treat. This is a movie that knows full well that the patient is already dead, leading us through this exercise in the hope that our journals and notes might help save the next desperate child who plays out her story with the dollhouse.",The Love Witch
136,greendirl,The Love Witch Was Horrible!!,1,26 July 2019,"I don't mind period pieces, if you are doing that, but new cars in the background,and the cop that pulled her over was in a circa 2000's cop car. But everyone is acting like it's the 1960/70's. I can't, just can't. I have it till about 35 minutes in. And low and behold, IT STILL SUCKED!!! BAD ACTORS, LOOKS like first timers with the way it was filmed..... Please help!!! And the theme is horrible and garishly bad decorations for her place are burning my eyes!!",The Love Witch
137,ensabahnour,A soft-core porn movie without star nipples!!,1,15 March 2017,"This movie is exactly a soft-core porn movie that pretends to be otherwise, while the star is ""unprofessionally"" - can't stop laughing here - is trying to hide as much of her nipples as she could. Yet they dub this a Hollywood 6.4 IMDb-rated movie. Total crap.I tell you what, the lead female Samantha summarized the whole story for this movie making in her scene with her friend's husband: She is the love witch that seduced all those critics into high-scoring this porn-failure, managed to get many others to share this deed with her and to get away with a 6.4 IMDb false rating. Perhaps these were just the words that Ana Biller were saying to herself!!!!Waste of time.",The Love Witch
138,pipelespaul-09396,Visually Stunning and Fun,10,28 March 2017,"I absolutely love the layers and movement in this film. It is shot and lit sublimely. The direction of sets, costumes, casting, fresh viewpoints, and subject matter...it is a classic amongst everyone I've turned it on to. I saw it in a theatre first. In buying the blu ray, and a second watch; I realized the score is also pleasantly unique. On top of all this, Samantha Robinson is very nice to watch as well! Enjoy!",The Love Witch
139,bbgunnisart,Genius Direction,10,31 March 2017,"Anna Biller not only directed this film, but wrote the screenplay, designed costumes, painted set pieces, recorded music, and even wove a pentagram RUG! This movie is a labor of love that exceeds the expectations of low-budget projects. If anything, this film is more beautiful than anything released in the past 20 years. Oh, the story, acting, casting, everything really, is 100% perfection.",The Love Witch
140,moonfan11,This great Love Witch will only become stronger,10,5 April 2017,"As someone who has seen this film from start to finish about half a dozen times I highly recommend multiple viewings. Because we're almost never offered filmmaking on physical film these days the nuances are not as easy to catch because it's easy to be dazzled by the world class cinematography of M. David Mullen, the beautiful cast, exquisite love scenes, the costumes and of course the unrivaled directorial style of Anna Biller. Subsequent viewings will yield a much more serious film where the retro and mise en scene recede somewhat and the very dramatic and tragic nature of the story comes to the forefront.Anna Biller is one of the world's greatest film directors with a criminally underrated selection of excellent earlier work.Those complaining about the length please consider that we've all seen Clockwork Orange multiple times which of course is a masterpiece within cinematic history. Thus we've all had to watch Alex sign forms in triplicate and march around the prison to Elgar once he's admitted. Perhaps Kubrick could of cut that lengthy sequence too but he didn't because it was his work of art. It just isn't about fitting everything into a 90 minute format or into some mass brand feature. A director has a specific vision. I don't see how the musical and Lord Summer-isle castle sequences in the once derided (and now wholly sacred) Wicker Man have any time variance to the Renaissance or strip club scenes in TLW. The scope of the mock Renn wedding is important because it feeds Elaine's delusions that she's achieving her goal of being loved. Back at the tea room she's showing off the fake ring like it's some pre engagement ring. (Spoiler alert) Most importantly after literally savoring Grif's death, a clinically insane Elaine wholly transports back to the wedding to relive her dream of being loved, married and riding away fulfilled on a white horse. My own take on the end is that like the last ten minutes of Lindsay Anderson's ""If..."" the film starts to break into surrealism. Just as Anderson has the ""dead"" head master pulled out alive from a filing cabinet to shake hands with the student shooters we all know that Grif would not have gone back to Elaine's flat after helping her escape the lynch mob in his patrol car. She has killed him in some other way and is perhaps institutionalized? Seeing how mentally ill Elaine is over weddings and fanfare makes the length of the movie as is, even more essential. But that's not to say this film isn't a lot of fun! In fact a complete delight with some Black comedy among its many genre defying elements. Splendid performances were coaxed out of the actors by the director, specifically the Anna Biller perennial, Jared Sanford. An exceptional actor with a beautiful speaking voice, Sanford plays Gael, a character not that far off from one of those Dr. F***/ Laurel Canyon types that migrated to Sonoma County in the 80s. Reborn as a New Ager, practicing their craft with utmost sincerity while still hitting on girls a 1/3 their age. Gain Keyes who turns in a brilliant performance not unlike the two leads in the Reincarnation of Peter Proud (Michael Sarrazin and Tony Stephano), English actress Trish Waddell and the Michael Chabon-like Jeffery Wayne Parise round out the stellar cast.Ultimately The Love Witch screenplay is about all women who've tirelessly created a relationship with a partner and found failure after failure; abuse after abuse and abandonment after abandonment. The fact that the lead actress is exquisitely beautiful is not that remarkable because we all know beautiful women don't have a guarantee of a perfect life with men. Lead actress Elaine (played by the staggeringly talented Samantha Robinson) decides that she's had enough of abuse and she takes charge by using witchcraft as a vengeful talisman in attempt to be loved. From start to finish The Love Witch is a masterpiece which will only grow more in stature as years progress.",The Love Witch
141,kingsoft-31994,Amazing work of art.,10,23 July 2017,"Excuisite work of art, not knowing this movie was made last year surprised me even more. Beautiful color, costumes, the little details in the set, and the main lead. The plot's slow, exactly like old movies, some people who are accustomed with fast paced movie plot of course cant enjoy it, to me watching this movie is like reading a book, it's relaxing. Once again amazing cinematography, there're some movie that tried to copy old style cinema, ""the artists"" for instance, it didn't feel classic at all, the main lead, the forced black and white color & mute dialogue, it doesn't come close to the classic technicolor feeling like this artistic movie.",The Love Witch
142,bobbysjones,You certainly wont forget it.,8,30 August 2017,"I haven't seen a film this divisive for quite some time. I saw it with a group of friends and the reaction was pretty split down the middle. Half seemed to think it was an utter work of genius. The other a self indulgent bore. Personally I have a foot in the 'genius' camp. The whole experience was completely hypnotic. The cinematography, the design, the score and the central performance are so deliciously stylized I couldn't help but being entranced- which is pretty apt given the material. However it is these very idiosyncratic elements that may conversely put a large section of the audience off. If you have an affection for Camp B-movies from the 70's you will be in Nirvana. If not you might find yourself in hell. One thing is far sure is you are going to have a strong reaction and this wont be a film you will forget in a hurry.",The Love Witch
