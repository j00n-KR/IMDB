0,Leofwine_draca,Pass the weedkiller,7,27 February 2011,"A surprisingly decent pulp horror outing with its roots (no pun intended) purely in the 1930s: this is based on a contemporary novel which I'm convinced must have been inspired by the Clark Ashton Smith short story The Seed from the Sepulchre (coincidentally one of my favourite stories ever). The story is simple, an age-old tale about naïve teenagers on a holiday from hell, not dissimilar to PARADISE LOST in its own way. Once the characters find themselves trapped in an ancient Mayan temple and at the menace of a most unusual monster it really picks up.The horror is a neat mix of slow-building fear with graphic surgical gore, a la HOSTEL. It certainly doesn't pull its punches, with one graphic set-piece particularly difficult to forget afterwards. There are plenty of other chilling moments, like the bits involving mimicry or a later scene that literally gets under your skin. The youthful cast is typically dull, with only the German character provoking interest, but that doesn't matter when the story and pacing are so well achieved. It's amazing what a little originality can do: compare this to something like the exceptionally dull PROM NIGHT remake and you'll see what I mean.",The Ruins
1,SnoopyStyle,the plants are interesting,5,19 May 2016,"Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Stacy (Laura Ramsey), and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) are friends on vacation in a Mexican westernized resort. The two couples are befriended by Mathias (Joe Anderson) who leads the group to a Mayan temple ruins with his friend Dimitri. Mathias' brother Henrich is doing an archaeological dig inside the temple. Mathias uncovers a hidden trail. The group is confronted by Mayan locals. Dimitri is killed while the group escapes up the temple. The Mayans are gathering. The phones don't work and the group has no supplies. A phone is ringing inside the temple. Mathias falls down the shaft into the temple. They discover the locals are actually afraid of the vines growing on the temple.It's a really slow first third. It's a bunch of young people without much tension. The temple is fine but it's not until the moving vines before it gets truly interesting. The Mayans need to be scarier and they need to be trying to kill the group. That would keep the tension higher. It's a bad sign when the plants are the most interesting aspect of a movie but it does lead to some nice body horror scenes.",The Ruins
2,claudio_carvalho,The Mayan Ruins and the Climbing Plants,7,8 July 2008,"While on vacation in a resort in Mexico, the Americans Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), his girlfriend Amy (Jena Malone), her best friend Stacy (Laura Ramsey) and her boyfriend Eric (Shawn Ashmore) befriend the German Mathias (Joe Anderson) in the swimming pool. Mathias invites the group to visit the ruins of a Mayan temple with his Greek friend Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas) in an archaeological field where his brother Henrich and his girlfriend are camped eighteen kilometers far from the resort. They hire an old taxi and when they reach the spot, they are surrounded by Mayan villagers armed of revolver, rifle and bow-and-arrow that kill Dimitri and do not allow the group to leave the place. They climb a construction covered of creepers with red flowers, and remain under siege of the locals. When they hear a cell phone in the bottom of a well, Mathias decides to seek the apparatus using a rope that breaks and he has a serious accident breaking his back. Amy and Stacy go to the bottom of the mine to rescue Mathias and they find many corpses covered by the climbing plants; further, they realize that they had been lured by the plants that are vibrating with the sound of a cell phone. When they are attacked by the carnivorous creeping plants, they understand the reaction of the Mayan villagers.""The Ruins"" is an original horror movie, with a different and creepy story, good performances of the young cast and great special effects. The beauty of Laura Ramsey is impressive, and the great actress Jena Malone performs an annoying character. The scene of the amputation of Mathias legs is extremely gore and gruesome. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Ruins
3,kosmasp,Rebuilding,6,20 August 2013,"I have to admit, I was positively surprised by the movie. Now I'm not saying this is good by a high standard. The CG effects are bad to say the least. But you shouldn't expect otherwise from a movie with a tiny budget like that. The acting is below average I guess from most, but it actually adds to the fun you can have while watching it. I wouldn't call it a ""trash"" component, but it is just right for the movie.The movie is predictable, but you can still feel how much fun they had making it. So what it boils down to, is if you can watch movies with small budgets that can be considered bad, but are good in being exactly that. There are better horror movies out there, but this can serve as party movie, you and your friends can enjoy",The Ruins
4,jboothmillard,The Ruins,6,11 October 2013,"I had heard this title a few times and I knew it was a scary movie, I assumed it would be something set in an old castle or ancient grounds or something, I was very close, and I satisfied my curiosity. Basically four American friends, couple Jeff (In the Valley of Elah's Jonathan Tucker) and Amy (Sucker Punch's Jena Malone) and couple Eric (X-Men's Shawn Ashmore) and Stacy (The Convenant's Laura Ramsey), are in vacation in a resort in Mexico, and wanting to see the sights they are invited by German tourist Mathias (The Grey's Joe Anderson) to explore the ruins of a Mayan temple with his Greek friend Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas). They trek through the jungle hoping to find the archaeological field where brother Henrich and his girlfriend are camped, they go on a hidden track further into the trees and shrubs, and they find the Mayan temple, but they are soon surrounded by villagers armed with guns and bows and arrows. Dimitri is killed by these people trying to get away, but the other five climb to the top of the ruins to avoid being shot, the top is covered by plant creepers and red flowers, it seems they are trapped as the villagers remain at the bottom waiting for them to come back down. They survive on the food and drink that remains in their bags, but they have the chance to get help when they hear a cell phone ringing in the well next to them, but an accident occurs when Mathias tries to reach the pit, the rope snaps and his back is broken. The others build a backboard and lower with Amy and Stacy hanging on to help the German onto it, they manage to get him out, but they are still trapped at the top of the ruins, so they try again with the backboard to go back down and find a cell phone. They hear the ringing again and the girls go into the well to try and find it, but they realise with the light in the darkness further down that the ringing is in fact the living plants vibrating, and these deadly vines try to attack and kill them, so they race back to the top. The villagers were obviously afraid of the plants, and will kill anyone who has come into close contact with them, as they are predatory and carnivorous, during the vines eat flesh from Mathias's broken legs, and the friends are forced to amputate them, but Jeff is convinced because they were not seen leaving the hotel that they will be searched for and rescued, so after arguing they agree to stay and wait. Stacy has some living vines get inside her leg and the other help her get them out, Mathius is suffocated when the plants go down his throat, and slowly Stacy becomes slowly more crazy, due to other plants inside her, thinking she is hearing love making, and she mutilates herself trying to get them out. Stacy in her madness accidentally stabs and kills Eric, she begs Amy to kill her, she is killed eventually, Jeff realises they will die if they remain, so he helps Amy to escape, he lays her like she is dead on the ground and gets the attention of the villagers, she crawls away while he is shot dead, Amy runs through the jungle and reaches the Jeep and speeds away, other people are seen approaching the ruins. Also starring Men in Black's Sergio Calderón as Lead Mayan, Balder Moreno as Mayan Horseman and Patricio Almeida Rodriguez as Taxi Driver. The cast all do well being freaked out, terrified and slowly maniacal, being based on a novel apparently critics say it is not as tense as the original text, but to me it doesn't matter, because you have possessed shrubs with long tendrils clasping and creeping their way around, and there is a good amount of blood as they savage the victims, a creepy and graphic horror thriller. Good!",The Ruins
5,Woodyanders,A surprisingly good and upsetting horror chiller,8,4 March 2010,"Four friends vacationing in Mexico go check out a remote ancient temple located deep in the jungle. The quartet discover that the ruins harbor a lethal strain of sentient vines. Trapped on temple by a fierce band of Mayans, the foursome eventually succumb to despair and paranoia as their dire situation goes from bad to worse as the days unfold. Director Carter Smith, working from a dark and uncompromising script by Scott B. Smith, does a bang-up job of creating and sustaining a creepy and intense atmosphere of sheer skin-crawling dread and unsettling hopelessness which becomes more increasingly bleak and nightmarish as the narrative progresses towards a startling downbeat conclusion. While the premise about killer vines sounds absurd and laughable, it's made potent and disturbing thanks to the grimly serious tone, a refreshing and admirable dearth of silly humor that would have only diminished the severity of the harsh and unpleasant horror, a generous helping of extremely nasty gore (a revolting moment of self-mutilation and a sequence with an infected man having both his legs amputated rate as the definite stomach-turning splatter highlights), the excellent and convincing special effects, a substantial amount of claustrophobic tension, and the overall impressive and proficient execution. Kudos are also in order for the uniformly sound and credible acting by the able cast: Jonathan Tucker as the amiable, noble Jeff, Jena Malone as the whiny, selfish Amy, Shawn Ashmore as the easygoing Eric, Laura Ramsey as the sunny Stacy, Joe Anderson as hunky German tourist Mathias, and Sergio Calderon as the fearsome head Mayan. Darius Khonji's sumptuous widescreen cinematography astutely captures and conveys the isolation and vulnerability of the lush tropical setting. Graeme Revell's spare shuddery score hits the spine-tingling spot. Well worth seeing.",The Ruins
6,rmax304823,Ruins is right.,2,19 January 2009,"I don't know. What happens when a film like this is produced? Do they start OUT to make another meretricious horror flick, making sure they hit all the necessary marks -- innocent kids partying, high hinks in isolated location, mysterious threat, resentful autochthones, exploding head, half-naked woman, something crawling under the skin? Only this time, somebody suggested they might as well do it while on an Australian vacation since nobody was going to put any effort into it anyway? If you find this appealing, then you've probably seen it in other, better configurations.The beginning is okay. A group of college kids have a drunken party on the beach of a Mexican resort. The next day they team up with a young German tourist to visit some ruins that his brother is digging up. A pick up truck drives them to the bushy and desolate wasteland. Native Mayans show up shouting unintelligible orders and warnings and finally start shooting arrows at the terrified youngsters and wind up blowing off half the head of one of them. The kids retreat to the top of a Mayan ziggurat where things only get worse. The German kid falls down a hole and breaks his spine. The vines turn out to be sentient and malignant. And then -- well -- so it goes.Nothing wrong with the direction, which is at least functional if not in any way innovative. And nothing wrong with the performances either. All the kids do a reasonably professional job. Laura Ramsey as Stacey (are they still hanging that albatross of a name around the necks of helpless baby girls?) is beautiful and sexy. Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German visitor, has a slyly crabwise control of his German accent. Queensland does an equally good impression of Mexico. And Jena Malone as Amy is really quite good, much better than this material.What are they doing in this by-the-numbers goose-pimple-raising junk that overflows with blood and horror. Who enjoys watching a handful of nice white rich kids get slaughtered? I wouldn't go so far as to press for a moral, but can't the film at least have a REASON for being?",The Ruins
7,BA_Harrison,Here's a little holiday tip for ridiculously hot teenagers taking a vacation: don't stray off the beaten track.,6,16 July 2008,"The Ruins is yet another teen horror flick that reinforces the old genre cliché that to stray off the beaten track means certain death. This time around, it is four stupidly attractive Americans (a couple of very sexy chicks and their buff boyfriends), who wind up wishing they had stayed by the pool-side sipping Margueritas whilst topping up their tans.Instead, they choose to join a couple of German guys on a trip to an archaeological dig at a Mayan temple hidden deep in the jungle. Unfortunately for them, after locating the ancient weed-covered ziggurat, they are attacked by locals who force the travellers to the summit of the ruins (well, all except one of the Germans, who is shot with an arrow and has his brains blown out), where they face a new danger: killer plants that burrow into your flesh!!!I doubt very much it was the makers's intention, but The Ruins is so silly that it is freakin' hilarious, and therefore actually pretty entertaining. Technically, The Ruins is a very slick film, with reasonable direction, solid performances from its young cast, and some very effective special effects (including some truly nauseating gore). But the plot is another matter entirely...Apparently, the natives have taken it upon themselves to prevent the deadly weed that covers the ruin from spreading; they achieve this by clearing the immediate area of foliage, salting the earth, and quarantining anyone who touches the plant, killing them if they attempt to escape.This all seems like a bit of an unnecessary hoo-ha to me. Wouldn't there be the constant danger that animals and birds could come in contact with the creepy vines, thus making their job almost impossible? It is a jungle, after all! I'd either buy a truck load of Weedol, torch the bloody thing, orhey, here's an ideacall in the authorities. Job done!And the teenagers act almost as dumb as the natives, following strangers into uncharted jungle on a whim, taking virtually no provisions (one bottle of water and some tequila), and using an old, knackered rope to lower themselves down a deep shaft! Still, I guess that all this plot-hole ridden silliness does mean that the film is never dull, and is perfect for a laugh with a few like-minded friends. There are some brilliantly chuckle-some moments that have to be seen to be believed, including the bit where it is revealed that the plants can mimic almost any sound (why? who knows), an impromptu hand-job scene amid all of the terror, and a messy double leg amputation using a rock and a small knife. Plus there is eye-candy aplenty for viewers of both sexes (I was more than happy with both brunette Jena Malone as the tasty nerd type, and blonde hottie Laura Ramsey, who obligingly strips off at the beginning of the film).By no means a particularly good movie, The Ruins still gets a very reasonable 6/10 just for being able to keep me interested 'til the end, and providing me with a few giggles along the way.",The Ruins
8,Quinoa1984,Italian giallo in American mainstream clothing,6,10 April 2008,"The Ruins takes place in Mexico with four college-age kids (Tucker, Malone, Ashmore and Ramsy) and another guy (Anderson), the latter who takes them to a Mayan temple where his brother is working supposedly on a dig. When they get there, a bunch of angry Mexican-Myans attack them, they scurry up to the top of the temple, and are basically quarantined with a host of virulent, monster-type plants and vines, who in typical horror fashion kill them off one by one. That's the basic premise, anyway, and if you know that and have seen the trailer you probably took a guess whether this is up your alley. For me, I was as intrigued by the trailer as I was who I found out wrote the screenplay, and subsequently the book of the movie's title- Scott Smith, who also wrote the morality drama A Simple Plan. What would these two works have in common at all, or to put it another way how would the same guy who wrote one wrote the other? Maybe it comes down to how I interpreted it through the direction (Simple Plan had Sam Raimi, and made it one of his best films, this one has Carter Smith, someone I've never heard of before as it's his feature debut). But, basically, both works, and this one in particular, are about seemingly smart and resourceful people acting really stupid in crunch-time. The college kids here are more or less cut-outs as characters, with some making stupider decisions than others (i.e. Malone's character basically killing off some characters thanks to her incessant lack of logic). Normally this would be just a given, but it's interesting to see that the actors don't do a half-assed job playing them- especially, surprisingly, Real Cancun star Laura Ramsey, who acts just high-pitched enough to get her plight as she's infected by the vines- and the ambiguity involving the vines and the tunnel and the Mexican-Mayans at the bottom guarding the outer rim is pretty well done.It's a shame then that the horror comes best only in short spurts, mostly as Malone and Ramsey are in the dark recesses looking for a cell phone that isn't really there, and some visceral horror involving a character's leg amputations. Mostly, it veers a little one way or the other with these vines: they hearken back to Little Shop of Horrors and even the first Evil Dead movie, but it's not very goofy. At the same time, the screenplay doesn't evolve these characters too much past their point of no return. In the initial scenes, then the build-up, I was reminded of some Italian horror films (can't think of one right now but it'll come to me sooner or later), only here of course not dubbed over. It is fairly creepy, and it does provide stock characters, and it gives you that double-whammy of an ending that is half happy and half ""oh darn, there go some more"". It is what it is, and it isn't much more, depending on the fan of the genre. It probably works best with a bunch of friends who may or may not like it as a legitimate horror flick. 6.5/10",The Ruins
9,Coventry,Think twice before becoming a Vegetarian!,6,31 August 2008,"Initially I didn't have the slightest interest in watching ""The Ruins"", and this only because I vaguely read half of the plot summary's first sentence, which said: ""Four young and attractive American tourists on holiday in Mexico befriend a German guy and together they embark on a journey to visit a hidden Mayan pyramid deep in the jungle"". Right there I stopped reading and promptly lost interest, as I was convinced this would turn out another typical gross-out torture flick in the trend of ""Turistas"", ""Live Feed"", ""Hostel"" and all those other nowadays horror movies where dimwit Americans fall prey to sadistic foreigners. Later  and sadly when the movie already left theaters  I learned that ""The Ruins"" actually revolves on murderous flesh-eating plants and some websites and reviews even made comparisons between this film and ""Day of the Triffids"" (which just happens to be a huge personal favorite of mine), so I couldn't wait until it came out on rental. ""The Ruins"" is indeed refreshing and more innovative than the aforementioned so-called Torture-Porn flicks and contains a handful of powerfully memorable highlights, but in general it's still a lacking and mediocre movie. ""The Ruins"" opens with fifteen minutes of dull and clichéd footage of American tourists partying abroad, but then on their last day they set out to visit a hidden Mayan pyramid that isn't even on any of the tourist maps. Once there, a tribe of seemingly petrified Mayans chase kill one of their newly made friends and chase the rest of the group to the top of the pyramid. Unable to leave, they quickly learn why the aboriginals are so scared. The inside and top of the pyramid are infested with deadly parasite plants that slowly surround the remaining survivors. The screenplay and tone of the film are very uneven, as moments of genuine terror and sheer suspense are interfered with truly imbecilic plot twists and implausible relationship conflicts. How are you supposed to interpret a movie that features menacing Maya-tribes and eerie subcutaneous vegetation, but then suddenly also suggests that certain monstrous plants are capable of imitating the sound of a ringing cell phone? If it wasn't for a couple of really stupid and disappointing elements ""The Ruins"" could have been a modest sleeper-hit, especially because the psychological decay of the lead characters is grimly illustrated and also because the gory parts are effectively repulsive. If you have a weak stomach or sensitive nerve system, I wouldn't exactly recommend the scenes involving an icky leg-amputation and a relentless Maya execution. Carter Smith does a good job directing his first long feature and the acting performances are more than adequate enough for this type of film. I didn't expect the promising and talented young actress like Jena Malone would go on starring in horror flicks, but at least she opted for a remotely decent one.",The Ruins
10,michaelRokeefe,Disturbing vacation goes from bad to worse.,7,20 July 2008,"Gut-wrenching and not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. OK, maybe not that horrific; but you will immediately check for any opened wounds. A group of college friends are on vacation in Mexico and they meet a German traveler who is going to meet up with his girlfriend that is an archaeologist on a ""dig"" near a Mayhan ruin. He talks the tight-knit group of Americans into tromping through the jungle; and away they go and stop on finding the grounds of a former Mayan temple. What they discover is that the ruins play host to a diabolical plant life that feeds on human flesh and invades its host by way of cuts, abrasions and opened wounds. Some scenes are definitely disturbing and will make your skin crawl. Special effects are pretty realistic. The cast includes: Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Dimitri Baveras, Laura Ramsey and Shawn Asmore.",The Ruins
11,hitchcockthelegend,Nothing ruinous about this crafty chiller.,7,5 October 2012,"The Ruins is directed by Carter Smith and adapted to screenplay by Scott B. Smith from his own novel of the same name. It stars Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Shawn Ashmore, Laura Ramsey and Joe Anderson. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography by Darius Khondji.Two young couples on holiday in Mexico make friends with a German tourist, Mathias (Anderson), who tells them of his missing brother who had gone off to view a Mayan ruin deep in the jungle. Their interest piqued, they agree to go on the adventure the following day. Once arriving at the remote ruin, though, they all find more than they bargained for....Hot young cast in horror film that follows a stagnated formula? Well no, actually. It has all the hallmarks of being yet another in a sad long line of horror movies that con the faithful into watching it, only to disappoint with an unadventurous plot, making a quick bit of cash before disappearing in the stale popcorn tinted wind. The Ruins has generic moments, certainly the first half hour is your standard meet and greet your young protagonists stuff, but once we get to the ruins of the title the film shifts into a different world. Our fears that this is going to be just another case of guessing what order the young holiday makers are going to be sliced and diced, are quickly vanquished, this is a tale of survival, of a youthful group dynamic under severe threat, and bonus here is that the antagonist is something very different to what normally stalks these genre movies.This really could have been a cheese fest, an unintentionally funny film, using gore and nudity to hide shortcomings in the screenplay, but it's not, writer Scott Smith has provided director and cast with material that pulses with an unexpected bleakness, a facing up to mortality at a young age, and crucially the characters do viable things given their circumstance, and that's mighty refreshing in a era of horror bulging with stupidity. It helped me personally that I knew next to nothing about the film before viewing it, and unlike some film lovers I'm not overly familiar with the young cast, though Joe Anderson is always on my plus list after his turn as Peter Hook in Control. But while it clearly didn't revolutionise horror as a genre, it at least had the gumption to veer in a different direction, going deeper in basic thematics than similar big budgeted films have.Tension is deftly mounted, what blood and body horror there is (and a couple of scenes are genuinely wince inducing and well staged) is not cheap and exploitive, while the finale doesn't cop out. True, there are some unanswered questions that leap out when the end credits roll, and anyone expecting a fast paced thrill ride are right out of luck. Yet for those who lean towards a good psychological horror then this is very much recommended. 7.5/10",The Ruins
12,Theo Robertson,Body Horror Meets Torture Porn In Memorable Shocker,7,12 July 2010,"A few years ago the word "" torture porn "" became a more and more common phrase involving cinema . With the exception of PASSION OF THE Christ they seemed to revolve around a formula of "" Backpackers meet up abroad , get kidnapped by indigenous nutters and get explicitly tortured to death . The end "" On the surface THE RUINS may be just another horror film where horny teenagers get bumped off one by one but dig a little deeper and you'll find something different . Oh and isn't that last sentence appropriate as to happens to these characters ? Set in Mexico some American backpackers meet a German who suggests visiting an ancient Mayan temple which the backpackers agree to , only to be attacked by some locals who kill one of their party and chase them up to the top of the temple . Why do they do this ? Strangely this inciting incident is never really explained but this shouldn't be taken as a massive criticism because it's an enigmatic horror film that whilst having some truly stomach churning effects never really talks down the audience . Both the director Smith and the screenwriter Smith combine to tell the story via the characters situation . By this I mean the audience are never one step ahead of the characters . When a plot turn - of which there are many - happens both the audience and characters see the revelation on screen at the same time . Certainly the whole premise of people being murdered and mutilated by semi intelligent flora is ridiculous but it's written , directed and acted with such conviction that the laughable becomes very credible within the film's running time . What THE RUINS sets apart from other films in the sub genre of torture porn is that there's a strong element of body horror along with character's optimism being crushed . These two aspects are summed up with one of the characters finding out that there's vines growing inside her . She has them graphically cut out "" Ah she's saved "" gasp both the backpackers and audience . She screams that they're not all been purged and cries that there's one inside her head . Sure enough a small bulge in her forehead moves around . Hopes are built up and quickly dashed in this pessimistic shocker All in all this is a rather memorable horror film . It's a film however that will not appeal in any shape or form to those who don't like gore . Interestingly enough I once had a conversation with a professional film critic that the banned video nasties of the 1980s are often tame compared to more mainstream horror films of the early 21st century and he agreed . You'd be very hard pressed to name a more stomach churning film than THE RUINS but that said it also concentrates on suspense and mystery and struggling against natural adversity which while perhaps not making a great horror certainly a very memorable one",The Ruins
13,Hey_Sweden,"""Four Americans on vacation don't just disappear!""",7,11 November 2012,"Scripted by Scott B. Smith based on his own novel, ""The Ruins"" at least has a somewhat interesting if not entirely novel premise that helps it stand apart from other modern horror films. Granted, its characters have the potential to grate on the nerves of some viewers, but their situation is a grim one indeed and compelling in its disgusting little way. It may get under your skin just as the people in the story find their bodies invaded by an insidious natural force. Two couples - Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Stacy (Laura Ramsey) and Eric (Shawn Ashmore) are on vacation in Mexico when a new acquaintance, amiable German Mathias (Joe Anderson) convinces them to accompany him to an ancient Mayan temple that's the sight of an archaeological expedition. Once there, they're accosted by hostile locals and flee to the top of the temple where a much worse danger awaits them. As it so happens, the plants here are aggressive meat eaters - and pretty darn clever to boot. As things go from bad to worse throughout this movie, it's hard not to wince and feel a moderate amount of sympathy for what our protagonists go through, even though they get annoying at times. The special effects are quite well done, and we get to see the plants envelop our hapless quartet and force themselves down their orifices. The gore in the unrated version is very juicy as one character goes utterly crazy and mutilates herself in her attempt to remove the offending vegetation. The location shooting (actually done in Australia) is excellent and the atmosphere is therefore quite effective. The acting from all concerned is pretty good, with Anderson standing out in the most sympathetic role of the bunch. Horror fans looking for something a little different may find this to their tastes. It's played very straight, with no winking at the audience or obvious self-conscious genre references. Overall, a good effort. Seven out of 10.",The Ruins
14,preppy-3,Good but not great,7,10 April 2008,"A bunch of college kids (Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey) are on vacation in Mexico. They meet a friendly German man (Joe Anderson) who offers to take them to a Mayan temple that nobody else knows about. They go...but soon find themselves in terrible danger. SPOILER!!! The vines covering the temple are alive--and eat people!!! END SPOILER This is about 70% better than most of the horror films we've been getting. It has characters we know and care about; it doesn't have any of those stupid 'jump' scares that every horror film today seems to have; it has next to no nudity (only very briefly) and it doesn't rub gore in our faces. This movie has only two really gory scenes--and more is heard than seen. That, of course, makes it even harder to watch. I was literally cringing in my seat during these scene and it takes a LOT to get to me! With the sole exception of Tucker (he was WAY too calm) the acting is very good, the script has people reacting exactly how people might react in this situation and it's very well-directed. My only complaints are that this movie is a good one hour movie stretched out to 90 minutes. Sometimes it does get a little dull. Also it's never explained exactly WHY the vines are doing that. And how about those people who won't let them leave the temple? Why did they let them get there in the first place? So these questions kept nagging me and somewhat lessen the film.

15,dbborroughs,Creepy horror tale will stay with you,8,27 April 2008,"One of the better horror films of recent years, is creepy and scary and the sort of thing that makes your skin crawl. Its a simple story- several tourists go to a temple in the Mexican jungle that happens to be off the beaten path. There is of course something there and the locals are not happy about visitors. I won't say more since I'm going tempted to tell you way too much...which would be too much since the plot is simple. Its almost too simple. The reason the film works is that the film has decent characters and it does things that are decidedly not your typical horror movie choices. Its short, its sweet and it works. Its not perfect, there are one or two things I didn't like, but on the whole its a very good very creepy film. Frankly while Brazil got upset about Touristas a year because it might make think people about going there, Mexico should worry since this film will make anyone think again about going into ancient ruins.

I really expected a Saw-type film, and got a huge surprise when it turned out to be a thriller with an edge I have not seen done before.Now I'll be honest; I was certainly hoping for more of the lovely Laura Ramsey, but she did make the movie worth watching for her performance.

17,zardoz-13,Just Another Vine Mess,1,6 April 2008,"The scariest thing about freshman director Carter Smith's new horror movie ""The Ruins"" is the closing credits that list comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What was Stiller thinking when he sank his bucks into this chiller about cursed carnivorous undergrowth that creeps up on its victims and devours them. Oscar-nominated scenarist Scott B. Smith of ""A Simple Plan,"" adapting his own bestselling novel, sticks steadfastly to the standard clichés and conventions of all twentysomething scary sagas where reckless youth do everything but tote signs begging the forces of evil to eat them. Were cretinous characters not enough to contend with in this nihilistic nonsense, we're treated to yet another film where American tourists find themselves in jeopardy simply because they are Americans. Furthermore, unlike really good horror movies that explain why the monsters have a need to feed, ""The Ruins"" provides no explanation for the supernatural shenanigans of its villainous vines. The set-up for ""The Ruins"" resembles the 2006 horror movie ""Turistas"" where slimy South Americans trapped brainless American backpackers and harvested them for their internal organs. Indeed, ""Turistas"" generated some legitimate thrills and chills. ""The Ruins"" spawns nothing in the way of either thrills or chills. A malicious mastiff that suddenly lurches on-camera to snarl at our heroes is as close as it gets to a thrill. The rest of ""The Ruins"" borrows from another movie: ""The Descent,"" a superb, 2006 chiller about a bunch of babes plunged into a nightmare experience when they get lost in warren of caves inhabited by albino mutants with a blood lust for murder. A couple of other movies that served either intentionally or unintentionally come to mind, too. They are the straightforward 1968 Hammer horror classic ""The Lost Continent"" about murderous vegetation that menaces innocent bystanders in a sea of derelict ships and the Roger Corman cult class ""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (1961)about a New York florist that grows a man-eating plant in his shop.. ""The Ruins"" unfolds in the scenic, sunny Mexico where four frolicking American college kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of the ""X-Men"" movies), Stacy (Laura Ramsey of ""The Covenant""), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of ""Sleepers"") and Amy (Jena Malone of ""Pride & Prejudice""), are wrapping up their tequila-soaked spring break. Stacy loses a prized earring in a motel swimming pool, but a helpful Teutonic, twentysomething tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson of ""Copying Beethoven"") recovers it, and the group embraces him as newest best friend. These people live to party, and they have already made friends with a trio of Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his wayward brother who has accompanied a cute female archaeologist to a remote Mayan pyramid that isn't listed in any guidebooks. He offers to take them with him and they accept. First rule of horror movies: if nobody knows about the place where you're going, you'd be well advised to avoid it. Since they have only one day left, and they haven't done anything adventurous, our two couples along with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend, Dimtri (newcomer Dimitri Baveas), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid out. They catch a bus into the interior of Mexico and look for a taxi to take them on the next leg of their journey. A cabbie glances at their map and warns them to stay away. Second rule of horror movies: when the natives warn you to steer clear, you steer clear. A crisp twenty dollar bill helps him change his mind, and he hauls them off to their destination and then he skedaddles in a heartbeat. No sooner have our heroes found the mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth that looks suspiciously like a variation of Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than superstitious natives appear. They know that the pyramid is haunted, and they kill Dimtri without a qualm when he tries to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists scramble to safety atop the pyramid while the paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Eventually, the vines slink out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, ""The Ruins"" turns into ""Bug,"" the recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid movie about insects that get under your skin. Before long our heroes are carving each other up in a futile effort to extract the vines from under their skin. One particularly gruesome scene shows the Americans lopping off the German guy's legs to save his life. By comparison, it makes the tortures of the Spanish Inquisition look tame. ""The Ruins"" ranks as just another vine mess with nothing to redeem it.",The Ruins

Five tourists, four American and one German, go to an ancient Mayan temple to be devoured. By what you ask? The local vegetation. Yes, plants. The last time I saw flora attack someone was ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" but at least that was funny. The creators of this movie didn't have the sense to be funny, so they pump out a lame scary movie in which the shrubbery has a thirst for blood.",The Ruins

Lackluster big-screen take of Scott Smith's bestseller about four young Americans on holiday in Mexico who get talked into checking out a remote tourist attraction by a fellow traveler , wind up being sacrificial fare for an ancient strain of man-eating vine the locals are only too happy to oblige. While the material by Scott (who actually did the adaptation) is original and tense the horror is handled with muddled direction by newbie Carter Smith, and the end results are tersely frustrating. Even though it is ably acted by its principals the characters are seemingly homogenized cut-outs for the genre at hand.",The Ruins
20,neil-476,Rattles along nicely after a slow start,8,25 June 2008,"Four American college kids (two girls, friends from childhood, and their boyfriends) on vacation in Mexico decide to accompany a couple of German guys and a Greek bloke to view a Mayan temple which is off the tourist maps. What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot, it turns out, starting with the old geezer who turns up at the pyramid temple brandishing a gun.Normally I'm fairly happy to slip in spoilers galore, but I'm reluctant to do that here. I was expecting this to be a fairly generic teen horror and, while it certainly respects the conventions of the genre, it nonetheless goes off in some unexpected directions. You can easily find out what they are if you're minded to, but I'm not going to tell you.The cast is pretty unknown - Shawn Ashmore (Bobby Drake in the X-Men movies) is the best known actor. The film is a little slow to get going - the set-up could have been dealt with in 15 minutes rather than 30 - but once the central situation is in place, the film is quite gripping and moves along nicely.The opening scene is something of a red herring - you expect it to appear towards the end of the film, but it never does. It's as if it wasn't part of the film at all.The performances are all OK - whining starts off being the prerogative of one of the girls, but shifts to the other. The characters are stock, but that doesn't matter. The pyramid/temple is so convincing that one wonders if it was genuine rather than a set.For what, at first sight, appears to be a low-budget generic teen horror, this movie actually has quite a lot going for it. I enjoyed it.",The Ruins
21,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly underrated effort,9,24 November 2015,"Taking a vacation in Mexico, a group of friends arrive at a Mayan temple only to be trapped there by the locals afraid of the vines constantly surrounding the group and must try to find a way out of the situation.This was a highly enjoyable and entertaining affair. One of the better pluses is the fact that there's an incredibly menacing and fearful threat in the film, which are done through the rather creepy vines into a great threat with several really big parts toward them. One of them is that they're literally everywhere in here, covering just about all the surface area possible at the temple and given the reaction that the natives have toward them it makes for a really great threat. Their actions are also worthwhile in making them feared, and those scenes are really well-done here the big with the alive vine wall, which is just utterly creepy and very original as the set-up with the wailing voices coming from the area is nicely handled, the location of being underground in a dank, darkly-lit temple with little to no light provides a ton of atmospherics, and once the twist is revealed about what's actually down there, the whole scene is paid off nicely. The absolute best, though, is the original scene where they find out its powers, snaking out of the shadows to devour and consume fallen parts of a mangled body in front of everybody showing the vines as forces to be reckoned with. This also manages to feature two incredibly brutal scenes that are simply uncomfortable to watch. The first is the leg amputation, which is mainly due to the crudeness of the operation and the visuals and sounds presented make it a really good moment. The other big one where an operation ends up removing vines from several body parts at the same time is also great, as there's the visuals of the vines being removed and wriggling around along with the blood from the wounds, and the endless screaming and brutality make it an extremely uncomfortable scene. That's also the film's other big plus, the blood and gore as this one is quite bloody in its kills and wounds as well as another scene where another victim starts to cut themselves all over the body resulting in a severely bloodied body from head to toe that is quite grotesque-looking. Coupled with a furious pace, this one is a lot of fun since there weren't too many flaws with this one. One of the biggest ones is that there's a distinct inability to have the natives react to the dangers of the vines in completely different ways in similar situations with two key scenes involving characters touching the vines. When one trips and falls into them, despite not knowing what they are, leads the natives into high-pitched yelling and screaming and leading the group up the temple which gives the natives several opportunities to get a shot at killing that one yet nothing occurs. Later, when one of the natives' children merely touches it through absolutely circumstantial means for a shorter amount of time, the child is shot at point blank range without mercy. It's a shocking scene, but flies in the face of their earlier attitude towards the vines. The only other flaw is the failure to explain the history of the vines as there's a crack about animals avoiding it, but nothing else even comes close to explaining them, or what the native's connection with it really is with all the back-stories to this never given and left a mystery. These here are the real flaws to this one.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and scene of strong child violence.",The Ruins
22,Aaron1375,"Not really the killer plants that get you, but rather the dudes on the perimeter.",4,13 January 2010,"I watched this movie and have to say it was rather boring for me as I wanted a lot of blood and gore and maybe some nudity. I get virtually nothing except to think these kids deserve what they got and I kind of can not really pull for any of them to escape. Most of the movie is the character's just arguing and stuff of that nature so really there is not really all that much entertainment to be had here. There is not really all that much in the way of a good attacking creature either as the plants are alive and killing the people who are rather stupid enough to let themselves get attacked by a slow moving vine. Hence you have the reason why they could not just have the vines killing the people, no add to that the people who set up a perimeter around the pyramid trying to prevent the spread of this vine even if it means killing those trapped inside the area they set up. So you have these young people not only having to survive the plants and their incessant bickering they have to survive the sane men outside who know what a problem these plants could cause if left unchecked. Might have been a better movie with more of the stuff I like in a horror movie, but I will not say do not watch it cause it may work for you.",The Ruins
23,Wuchakk,Much better than the mediocre reviews would indicate,8,21 February 2015,"Scott B. Smith, writer of ""A Simple Plan"" (the novel and the 1998 movie), also wrote the 2008 novel & film ""The Ruins,"" which is about two college couples vacationing in Mexico who hook up with a German and visit an unknown Mayan pyramid off the beaten track. They are terrorized when local Natives surround the pyramid with deadly weapons, refusing to permit them to leave, and more horrified by the reason why!""The Ruins"" refuses to make the mistake of too many conventional horror flicks by not going over-the-top with the situation, the ""monster"" or the horror/thrills, which makes these films more goofy than horrifying. For instance, take the ending of ""The Ruins"" (which is different than the book and, in my opinion, better): In a typical horror movie there would've been a wild (i.e. thrilling but totally unbelievable) vehicle pursuit by the Mayan descendants; not here. It's the BELIEVABILITY of ""The Ruins"" that makes it effective, which is reinforced by the notable acting of the five protagonists.Speaking of which, I don't normally notice acting performances, but I found the acting stellar by the main protagonists – Jonathan Tucker as Jeff, Laura Ramsey as Stacy, Jena Malone as Amy, Shawn Ashmore as Eric and Joe Anderson as Mathias, the German. The two girls and Tucker (Jeff) especially stand out.I found these protagonists likable and fairly fleshed-out for a 90-minute horror flick. For one, they're not the typical frat trash you see in so many horror movies. Secondly, we see signs of character again and again, which I detail below.Some complain that the non-human antagonists are decidedly un-scary, but that's one of the main points of the movie. Like 1963's ""The Birds,"" it takes something we see every day and are NOT scared of and turns them into a source of horror.One memorable scene is when Stacy and Amy are in the dark bowels of the pyramid searching for a cell phone they keep hearing. What they discover is equal parts shocking, surreal and amazing. More on this below. Another memorable sequence is when Jeff & Eric are forced to perform a gruesome operation. The ending is also well-done and suspenseful.While the story takes place on the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, it was surprisingly shot at Gold Coast and Tamborine Mountain, Australia, just south of Brisbane, which is on the East coast. In any case, the locations are spectacular.BOTTOM LINE: ""The Ruins"" really surprised me in light of the inexplicable mediocre ratings and incessant panning. It's an adventure story mixed with psychological horror utilizing something common and un-scary as the ""monster."" It features quality gore, excellent locations & props, top-of-the-line performances and quality filmmaking in general. Plus it takes advantage of the presence of Laura Ramsey and eschews the overdone cartoony-ness of too many horror flicks, which are more funny than creepy or horrifying. In other words, ""The Ruins"" delivers the goods.The theatrical version runs 90 minutes and the unrated version 93 minutes. I viewed the latter.GRADE: B+ or A- ***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read further unless you've seen the film) The plants that live on the pyramid and what they are able to do spur a fascinating point: The animal kingdom spans the spectrum of worms to human beings. What about plant life? The plants at the Mayan ruins are obviously from the higher-developed end of the plant kingdom – they work as a team to obtain sustenance and are able to mimic sounds, like human voices and the ringtone of a cell phone, etc.I've heard complaints about how the protagonists constantly make the wrong decisions. Answer: The foursome had befriended Mathias and therefore trusted him. They wanted to experience some Mayan history off the beaten track. When the Natives suddenly arrive on the scene and brutally shoot one of their members in the head the only place for them to safely flee is the pyramid. At that point they're stranded because the Natives have the ruins surrounded. How is any of this a wrong decision? Besides, show me a list of the most popular horror flicks and I'll be able to cite way more ridiculous decisions by the protagonists than seen in ""The Ruins."" Someone complained that the youths never attempt to escape the pyramid until it is basically too late, which supposedly defies logic. Answer: They're only on the pyramid for two nights and were waiting for help to arrive. Their only other recourse was to make a run for the jungle, which was impossible because the pyramid was surrounded by Natives with deadly weapons who already proved they would kill without mercy anyone infected by the plants. As such, the most logical thing to do was to wait for help and only make a run for it (to the jungle) if they absolutely had to, which is what happens. Sounds logical to me.I've heard the criticism that the protagonists are imbeciles with little character development. I found them likable, as noted above, and there are numerous examples of character: They desire to experience the culture of the area and not just utilize their exotic vacation to party, like the average one-dimensional spring-breakers. Also, they refuse to leave Mathias for dead in the pyramid and the girls risk going down the same dubious rope that resulted in his fall. Moreover, Jeff insists on performing the gruesome task of cutting off Mathias' legs and Eric agrees to help even while the primitive operation causes him to vomit. Lastly, Jeff willingly sacrifices himself so that Amy has a chance to escape and she makes a bold dash for freedom. All this sounds like character to me.Needless to say, the criticisms leveled at the film are mostly invalid or easily explained.",The Ruins
24,The_Void,"Feels like more could have been made out if it, but still a very interesting modern horror flick",8,27 December 2008,"On the face of it; The Ruins seems like it might be just another teen horror flick to throw on the pile with the rest of the plodding slashers and brainless gore-fests; but it appears that some actual thought was put into this one and while it's true that certain opportunities were missed and the film is not quite a modern day horror classic; it's a very well made and inventive little film that I'm sure will be appreciated by the 'serious' horror crowd. The plot begins with a group of four friends on holiday in South America. They meet a German guy and get drunk before the five of them decide to go off into the jungle looking for some old Mayan ruins. They find them eventually, but they also find a Mayan tribe who is not happy with them being there and after shooting the group's guide - chase them to the top of one of the ruins and then wait at the bottom. The group are relieved at first to be alive...until they realise that the flora at the top of the pyramid is more of a threat than the tribe below.Full credit has to go to The Ruins for originality; it's certainly not the first film to feature killer plants, but it's not exactly a common plot line and this blends extremely well with the idea of a superstitious tribe and the beautiful South American locations. First time director Carter Smith builds up his atmosphere nicely and allows things to simmer until the killer plants finally make their appearance. By then, their threat is mixed with boiling emotions within the group itself and the hopeless situation developing at the top of the central location becomes completely gripping. The director also treats us to some pulsating moments of gore - an impromptu amputation being the biggest highlight. The plot is where the film's problems come in - it does feel uneven at times and I also got the impression that more could have been made of the central idea. Still, this is a good film that works well. I consider myself a 'serious' horror fan, and I saw it with a group of people who have only a vague interest in the genre and by the end we all agreed that The Ruins is a good film.",The Ruins
25,zetes,"Not great, but better than one might expect",7,6 April 2008,"I was in the mood for a horror flick, and the trailer to this one was quite spooky. I was pretty sure I could read through the advertisement to see the movie beneath, but I figured, eh, what the hell. Thankfully, while the movie doesn't quite match the eeriness of that preview, The Ruins is a moderately successful horror movie. It's not too stupid, and it delivers some good scares. Nothing to write home about, but it's pretty rare even to find a decent movie in this genre. The movie starts out pretty unremarkably, introducing us to a bunch of vapid college students on vacation in Mexico. They meet a German backpacker who asks them if they want to help him look for his brother, who went to visit an archaeological site and never came back. They arrive at the base of a pyramid, and a bunch of natives with guns and arrows drive them to the top, and then don't let them leave. Of course, there's something even worse than natives up there. Unlike most modern horror films, The Ruins doesn't reveal everything straight away. It allows us to see stuff moving in the background, but doesn't introduce us to the real danger until quite a way into the picture. The acting is a little better than this kind of movie usually has. The wonderful young actress Jena Malone is the biggest name, and was, in fact, the reason I finally decided to see the movie. Laura Ramsey is surprisingly excellent for an actress who began her career with the MTV ""documentary"" The Real Cancun. Jonathan Tucker and Shawn Ashmore play the two American men, and Joe Anderson the German backpacker. It does end poorly, but I enjoyed it.",The Ruins
26,trashgang,Not ruined after all,6,4 October 2008,"Well; this flick had a lot of promo. So everyone was waiting to see this new horrorfilm moving away from the Saw/Hostel kind of movies. Even Fangoria was giving away a lot af attention, two issues about The Ruins. Once it was available at the cinema's it became a huge flop. Thriller fans left off because it was too bloody and horror addicts felt that there wasn't enough blood. I watched this with my girlfriend and she stopped watching due the hardness of the film. For me it was a real good movie especially the leg scene. The story itself, well , this couldn't happen but it was all made that you would believe it was happening. an open end so The Ruins 2 could be on his way but after the failure I don't think this is going to happen.

Amazing special effects which make the film . I like the surprise problem, of what or who the movie antagonist is. Why was it there. To protect the sight? What happens when someone leaves the sight. There is a whole lot of questions. Too bad the viewer could never understand what the villagers were saying. The Mexico vacation bit with the drunk girlfriend is way too real. I like how the movie ends. 7 out of 10 tropical drinks for The Ruins. Rent the Ruins or go out on date night. A lot of fun. I think we will see a few of these actors in many more films.",The Ruins

I have been waiting for movies after his books since forever. This is the closest yet. That doesn't mean it doesn't have its flaws, mainly the victims who almost made me hope for their early death.Bottom line: almost of the same caliber as The Descent, but a bit more psychological than that, without being any less disturbing. Certainly worth a watch. And if there is any sequel, maybe set in a town this time, I would like to see it.",The Ruins

So I didn't hesitate to see the movie today; I'm actually a little disappointed. Now with the pro's, we've got an awesome plot, it's a little unoriginal with the gore and the shock(ever since Hostel came out, it's hard to get a little more shocked) but the plot works and makes the movie extremely disturbing and makes you move around your seat and uncomfortable. The only problem I had was the characters, they were either very dis-likable or didn't even have any depth, so you didn't care wither they lived or died. It's a typical horror movie mistake, characters are neglected and we are left guessing, but this is still worth the watch for the non-stop scares.A four friends are on vacation in Mexico, just enjoying the time, getting drunk, dancing, the usual stuff. But when another man, a Greek named Mathias, invites them to explore the famous ruins of the land, he's also looking for his brother who disappeared there, so he wants to see if he's still there. When the group goes there, they are confronted by a tribe who cannot speak English or Spanish, and when one of the guys touches the vines, he is shot and killed, the others are told to get up onto the pyramid that's covered in vines. They have to figure a way out while being trapped there by the armed tribe, but something has gotten ""under their skin"".The Ruins is a decent horror movie, the best I've seen? For the year, sadly, yes, which I'm hoping there will be some promising horror movies to come up. I'm just disappointed with the characters and their development, the girls were obnoxious and the guys were stupid. But the effects were cool and creepy, I think we all have that fear of these flesh eating viruses, so this concept worked. I also liked that it wasn't so jumpy and it didn't try so hard to scare.

32,KineticSeoul,"Weeds don't only make you delusional and crazy, they also kill",7,23 October 2009,"Well it fit my expectations, there were some parts that was actually somewhat intense and difficult to watch in a good way. But maybe it's cause I watched the unrated version that has scenes that was deleted from the original. Two couples who are vacationing in Mexico and few others they meet up with in the beginning of the film decide to go on some excavations to some ancient ruins, but instead of the fun they were expecting they get a whole another dose of excitement where the weeds growing on the ruins has a will of it's own to infect and kill anyone that comes near the ruins. I got just about everything I wanted out of this film which is a plus, but you can't help yourself but keep asking, why? Why? Why? Cause a lot of what the two couples do doesn't make sense and is stupid at times, the actions of the people that try to quarantine the couple in the ruins don't make sense as well, but I assume it's to move the plot along. It was sort of a nice touch to make the humans more brutal, violent and graphic than the weeds in the ruins that kill people although they do it out of the intention of trying to help one another. This wasn't a original film by any standards but it was a nice change of pace even if some of the deaths were really stupid and for a non comedic movie such as this it don't really work like that decapitation scene and the aftermath. But all in all it's one of the better horror films out there and it also has a Laura Ramsey nude scene although it was brief she is hot.7.5/10",The Ruins
33,sddavis63,Pretty Good Suspense Flick,7,19 November 2009,"I thought for the most part that this was a pretty decent suspense.horror movie - one that certainly had enough of both qualities to keep me watching all the way through. Admittedly, there's no doubt some plot problems involved with it. The basic story is that a group of young people on vacation in Mexico go to see the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple, and end up being the victims of some local tribesfolk who don't want them to leave the temple and are willing to do whatever it takes to make sure that they don't, as well as of the real horror - flesh eating vines of some sort. The movie opened with a terrified shot of a woman trapped in the temple, leading me to assume that this was going to be a flashback type of movie explaining how she got into that situation. Instead, it seemed to be an opening that established a cyclical nature to what's happening. The opening, combined with the main story and a brief closing, tell us that apparently group after group arrive at the temple and all suffer the same fate. That the tribesfolk apparently have a standing protocol of sorts for dealing with these situations also indicates that visitors are not uncommon. That's one of the plot problems I mentioned, though. This is supposed to be a distant temple that few people travel to. If true, though, how do people keep showing up there to be victims for these vines? Curious. I also thought the story about the tribesfolk was a bit hokey. Perhaps it was a necessary plot device. If they weren't there how would you keep the victims of the vines in the temple? I understand that, but still found that part of the story a bit strange.For the most part, the actors in this were unknown to me, but they did a pretty good job creating the feeling of the increasing desperation the group would have felt as the chances of escape became more and more remote, and as the mystery of the vines became clearer to them. Amy's fate was left a bit ambiguous. She apparently escaped the tribesfolk, but still another group showed up at the temple in the closing shot. One would have thought that she would have told the story had she escaped.Plot problems aside, though, it's a story that draws you in. 7/10",The Ruins
34,lost-in-limbo,This wasn't on the holiday brochure!,8,6 August 2009,"Contemporary horror has been complained about being largely unoriginal and uninspired in recent times, but if you look hard enough and look beyond Hollywood presentations you'll find some surprises in the woodwork. And for me the low-budget project 'The Ruins' was one. What I thought was going to be a simple-minded creature-feature aiming for some laughs while picking off a young cast turned out to be actually more, although still a simple layout that formed in to a tearing psychological gripper that relied on building upon the characters and disorienting situation they were in a serious manner.A group of college friends and a German man visit a hidden site where a Mayan ruin stands, but the local tribe knows something they don't and soon they realize they won't let them leave the ruins alive. However they are the least of their problems, as something far more dangerous waits.Director Carter Smith draws upon a taut feel of growing dread and despair leading to a manipulative channel of anxiety and suspense, as the humidly exotic locations (caught by beautifully expansively widescreen photography work) go onto suffocates the air of hope. Scott Smith writes the inventively slow grinding screenplay (taken off his own novel), as we interestingly watch the characters slowly begin to lose their wits, fearfully turn on each other and battling the natural elements (there's a twist to that) to survive. Some moments do get a little repetitive it what can be seen as virtually a waiting game and the idea felt a little untapped, but it holds strong due to its solid momentum that can suddenly can strike up a nail-biting intensity and capable performances by the likes of Jena Malone (in an impressive turn), Jonathan Tucker (quite a sure-footed performance where he holds his own), Shawn Ashmore, Joe Anderson and Laura Ramsey. Concise editing helps it move along briskly and the score creepily hums through. Even with its sedate style, its violently graphic (with very good make-up FX) and emotionally scarring to make you cringe because you feel everything that these characters are encountering.'The Ruins' is a nightmarishly muggy and pressure-induced remote horror trek.

35,Robert_duder,Terror Horror at it's finest...another new spin on an aging genre,9,13 April 2008,"I am a horror fanatic so I give big kudos to any film maker or writer who can find a way to make a new spin on a very old and often considered worn out genre and for that The Ruins gets HUGE kudos. I thought it looked cool and that I would enjoy it but I was pleasantly surprised!! The Ruins is fast paced, intelligent with some really, truly breath taking performances. One of the most brilliant things I think about The Ruins is with the exception of the 15-20 minute introduction the entire film, all the horror, the monster, the legends, the story all takes place in a camp site on the top of an ancient Mayan temple that is maybe a couple thousand square feet and barely leaves that area and yet you aren't bored for a single moment. The action keeps coming, the horror is blood spewing and gritty and really makes you shudder and there are even some cheap scares...things that jump out at you or happen suddenly to keep you riveted into the story and ready for anything. I think despite how short The Ruins is you do get attached to the characters and the thing is they aren't heroic or particularly Hollywood but they all seem very real and they each have a very distinct personality and some of them you might not like but it's just the way they are and they are all in this horrifying nightmare situation.Jonathan Tucker is a bit of the leader. He's level headed and far more sensible than the rest and he is also the optimistic one. He tries to hold everyone together and Tucker really does a great job. You feel his struggle to hold on to sanity and save everyone else as well. His character is far more depthy than you'd initially think. Jena Malone has come a long way from her Stepmom days. This is most definitely her first full fledged adult role and she does well. The thing is...her character Amy is not necessarily one to like. She is whiney, and scared, and afraid to do anything, self involved, and a little shallow and Malone does a perfect job of carrying out that role and yet still enabling you to feel some sympathy for her character. I think this role could launch her career as an actress out of childhood. Shawn Ashmore perhaps gets the most laid back role as party boy Eric. He's straggly and you get the impression he doesn't necessarily know where he's at in life, maybe a little jealous of Tucker's Jeff who has a goal. Although his performance is a little quieter he still adds something significant to the foursome. As far as I'm concerned Laura Ramsey gives an award worthy performance...yes I'm aware that will never happen. Regardless she is absolutely amazing. One of the best performances I've seen this year. This role should make her a star. She goes from composed, fun, wild, to insanity, fear, pain, emotion and she is absolutely captivating and completely terrifying. A scene with her standing completely cut up by her own hands while she screams might be one of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen hands down.Love Horror? Science Fiction? Drama? Terror? A pinch of teen slasher but with a completely intelligent story that will leave you paralyzed to your chair? The Ruins is so much smarter than one would think looking at it. I think it most definitely exceeded my expectations because I just thought it would be your typical torture horror along the lines of Saw series, Turistas, Hostel one and two and so forth and it has a little of that feel to it but it is far smarter than any of those and the horror is gory and blood splashing and yet works into the story. I have never read the book but I am intrigued now by this writer, Scott Smith who wrote the book and the screenplay and this young Director Carter Smith who took this story and the small setting and just really made something dazzling. I hold The Ruins on the same pedestal as The Ring, Shutter (most recently), Saw, and so on. You don't want to miss this and ignore all negative feedback because this is one smart movie. 9/10",The Ruins
36,bowmanblue,A competent little horror flick,7,29 November 2014,"It's amazing that there are any teenagers left in America. Every time they seem to venture more than five miles out of their home town they seem to get picked off by Rednecks/Werewolves/Undead serial killers (take your pick).In The Ruins, we see your average bunch of plucky American teens (i.e. far too good looking to be believable) taking a well-earned holiday (sorry, vacation) to Mexico. All is going well until someone suggests venturing off the beaten paths to look at some... you guessed it, ruins.And, before you can say 'teen horror' our poor, hapless heroes are knee deep in (of all things) killer plants! Hardly the most fearsome for every to play its part in decreasing the population of an American High School, I hear you cry. But, to make matters worse, our young models are stranded on top of some ruins, surrounded by the feral fungi and they can't get off because the locals will shoot them if they do.All in all, it's a lot of silly fun - as is most mainstream horror these days. There's some nice gory scenes and plenty of things that happen even though any sane person wouldn't so that. But it's horror, right? So we're happy to suspend our disbelief.Give it a go - it's very watchable, plus, if these kids ever make it back to civilisation, they will get a guaranteed A+ for any 'What I did in my holiday' essay.",The Ruins
37,dromasca,Mayan horror in the shade of Solaris,4,9 September 2012,"I wonder if director Carter Smith and other folks involved in the making of The Ruins have seen Tarkovsky's Solaris. I like to believe that it's mandatory stuff in any school of cinema but I cannot know for sure. I am asking the question because 'The Ruins' is based on a very Solaris-like idea - a monstrous Thing that is alive and mimics the behavior of the human beings it comes in contact with. Here we have a horror story and the Thing is replicating sounds before penetrating the bodies and destroying the humans from inside. We never learn why, did it feel threatened? did the four young American trespass some sacred borders? but it does not matter too much, the fact that we are in Maya country must be enough for an explanation.The movie was made in the period after the Blair Witch Project conquered screens and captivated audiences (and their dollars) with the adventures of teens in a tent in an hostile environment. Suddenly everybody was making films with the same story structure, putting much more money in them, relocating in exotic places and providing variation on the theme of the monsters out of the tent. This is another one of these and it does not succeed as most other failed also to generate the thrill of the first time Blair film (which incidentally I see it has dropped to a 6.3 grade in the IMDb rating).Carter Smith does a reasonable job directing a team of young actors who start by looking like vacationers, then like participants in a 'Survivor' show and last assume the role of minced meed in the wheels of the horror show. The film has its good moments (a few) and its ridiculous moments (more of these) and overall will be enjoyed mostly by aficionados of the genre. The rest of us looking for some quality will remember just the few gems. These who remind Solaris.",The Ruins
38,MLDinTN,Vines that come alive...,7,14 December 2008,"not as stupid as it sounds. I thought this movie was a pretty good horror film. It starts out with 4 college kids on vacation in Mexico. They meet Mathias, whose brother has gone to an ancient Mayan ruin with a girl he met. Mathias plans to go the next day to meet them and invites the college kids he just met along. The group takes a taxi to the boonies and from there it's a good hike to the ruin. When they get their, some Indians show up and seem to be threaten. They kill one member of their group, and the rest flee up to the top of the ruin. What they learn later is that the Indians were afraid of the vines that cover the structure. At the top, they find some tents set up and think they hear a phone at the bottom of a tunnel being used to dig for artifacts. Mathias goes down first, but the rope breaks and he is badly hurt, and it all goes down hill for the group from that point on.They learn the vines are alive and appear to be growing on their clothes and in wounds. It causes a nasty scene with Mathias, and it drives Stacy crazy. She does something that is most disturbing. There is some blood and good gore shots, like chopping off legs and sticking fingers in wounds.FINAL VERDICT: Ancient vines can be deadly too. I thought the movie was decent. Better than a lot of horror films that have come out the past couple of years. I recommend it.",The Ruins

Soon, they find themselves trapped on top with lethal vines similar to ""The Evil Dead"" surrounding it. This starts off ok, but drastically becomes depressing rather than tense. The girls are also a bit annoying, but still cute and I like the remote settings.

43,FiendishDramaturgy,"Giallo with Depth...Not bad, But Not Great...At All.",6,8 April 2008,"Hi there. I'd like to start this by saying that there were a grand total of four (that's 4) people in the theater where this was showing. Too true, that it was the 4:30 PM showing on a Monday, but all things considered, there were 2 couples, one of which I was half, and that was IT. Honestly, depending on the mood, that can take away from a movie as much as it can add to one.Overall, ""The Ruins"" runs like a beefed-up alternate version of King's previous skit, ""The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill,"" in which Stephen King himself takes on the part of Mr. Verrill. It is a segment in the original ""Creepshow"" of the 1980's. You may remember it...a meteor crashes onto a nice bit of farm land and suddenly everything (and every ONE) is covered in a green Chia Pet-like substance, until finally it takes over all life.That's basically what you have here, only without Stephen King or a meteor. Well, that COULD be true, except we are not given a beginning; nor are we given an ending. We are never told how the killer topiary (of which King seems to have a fondness bordering on obsession - see The Shining, Lisey's Story, Creepshow, etc.) comes to be on this planet. Moreover, we are never clued in to the choice of location, and we are never given a proper conclusion to the excerpt they branded as, ""The Ruins."" In between the non-existent beginning and the non-ending, the excerpt we ARE given is entertaining, but in a total ""The Mist"" kind of way. I say that because of the level of despair generated by the work itself. While the endings are vastly different, the meat of these works is similarly defeatist, yet at the same time, they offer hope for those with the desire to find it.This work seems convoluted and abridged ... like a short story, which wasn't quite finished before its commitment to film. It leaves the viewer wondering how one third of a movie made it onto film in the first place? All in all? This is great entertainment for thriller fans, the horror element, and what seems like a good conceptual idea, although it is not developed adequately to allow us to really know.It rates a 5.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Ruins

Like other B science fiction movies, this one, I think will become a classic. I'm surprised that an actor who prefers to play a comedic role have taken on to produce a picture like this one. 8/10 for the quality of production, and additional 2/10 for the most insightful plot to come in recent years.",The Ruins
46,dee.reid,"""The Ruins"" review",8,6 April 2008,"""The Ruins,"" coming to us from director Carter Smith and screenwriter Scott D. Smith (from his own novel of the same name), is a lot smarter than the average horror film, despite a few flaws along the way. Rather than serving up relentless scares, pointless blood and gore and gratuitous sex and nudity, we instead get a careful examination of a group of people who find themselves in a horrifying situation and later going bonkers as a result of the pressure.The film has a simple enough set-up: Set deep in the Mexican jungle, a group of American tourists - Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), his girlfriend Amy (Jena Malone), Eric (Shawn Ashmore), and his girlfriend Stacy (Laura Ramsey) - are invited by a German archaeologist named Mathias (Joe Anderson) and his Greek guide Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas) to explore the ruins of an ancient Mayan temple.Things get hairy when local Mayan natives corner off the group, and they are forced to take refuge at the top of the temple. Praying that help will arrive soon and with dwindling supplies, the natives soon set up a perimeter at the base of the temple, threatening to kill them if they try to leave. What they don't know is that the natives are the least of their worries, for something even more terrifying, more horrific, is hiding in plain sight around them. I won't spoil anything by telling you what ""it"" is, but this malevolent force - whatever it is - is everywhere and nowhere, and it's looking for some warm human flesh to grow inside.There aren't too many moments in ""The Ruins"" where characters wander off down dark passages while we scream to ourselves, ""Don't go down there!"" For the most part, the film is set in broad daylight, one of the strangest moves for a horror film. But, Carter Smith manages to keep up an ominous mood throughout the entire picture - in light and in dark - that ensures you'll keep watching.In terms of gore and special effects, much of that doesn't take place until nearly an hour into the picture. When it does come, it allows for some pretty disturbing sights and sounds, as well some genuinely frightening moments. Smith does have a nice taste for horror imagery; our first sight of one of the ""things"" is sure to haunt us until the credits begin to roll. This great ominous force that terrorizes the main characters in ""The Ruins"" is not the slightest bit expected, which makes ""it"" even more terrifying as it causes them and us to realize that maybe they shouldn't make it, because, what happens if it has the chance to spread? With the things ""it"" causes the main characters to do as its infection spreads - cutting themselves open or removing limbs to rid themselves of its presence - is especially chilling. In that regard, the characters should be thinking about their containment and just waiting for all this to be over with.""The Ruins"" is an above average horror thriller that does manage to genuinely fright and disturb the viewer with its many sights and sounds. In a wasteland of run-of-the-mill horror flicks and with all the ""Saws"" and ""Hostels"" of the world (Ok, so I'm guilty for liking the ""Saw"" movies), it's good that we have at least one of ""The Ruins"" to break this dry spell the genre seems to be trapped in.8/10",The Ruins

49,parry_na,Spoilers follow ...,8,20 January 2017,"'Once there was a girl who got so drunk one night she stuck her tongue down some guy's throat,' relays one character to another member of his group of friends, eager to stir up some bad memories for Amy (an initially fragile performance from Jena Malone). Therein lies the first dilemma for this bunch of pretty boyfriends and girlfriends who, whilst holidaying in Mexico, allow themselves to be talked into investigating some ruins by fellow tourist, German Mathius (Joe Anderson). Although the friends are fairly appealing, their typical perfect-teen dramas in paradise are far from enthralling.But stick with it. As is often the way, when the poor blighters begin to suffer – and when they do, your heart genuinely goes out to them – then things become a lot more interesting. Of course, you wouldn't expect their obligatory cell phones to work deep within Mayan territory. And, unless you have read the novel on which this is based, you almost certainly wouldn't expect the antagonists to be malignant vines that grow throughout the temple's architecture. These spitefully lethal tendrils are a terrific surprise and a welcome break from sleek-jawed vampires and ubiquitous zombies who have for years made their presence felt in cinema. It is the way they are realised and what they do that makes them horrific – crawling over sleeping bodies during the night, entering the various wounds the youngsters have picked up and flourishing under their skin. They emulate sounds, their flower-heads singing like birds, simulating the chirping of a distant phone signal or, even more cruelly, copying the shrill cries of human distress: mimicking, even mocking the group they are infiltrating.'Four Americans on a vacation don't just disappear,' says Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) optimistically and with conviction. Whether his is right or not is a spoiler I'm not going to reveal. Infection, amputation, possession – it's all here. Recommended.",The Ruins

The group meet a German man named Mathias at their hotel, who invites them on a hike into the jungle to an archaeological dig at the site of ancient ruins. When they arrive, they are immediately confronted by violent locals, whom they are unable to communicate with, and after a violent confrontation they end up on the top of the vine-covered temple. What ensues is a bloody struggle to survive, as the friends are quarantined atop the ruin, and one by one become infected after coming in contact with the strange plants that cover the entire temple, which the local people appear to be extremely terrified of...I was skeptical going into this movie, thinking ""How much can be done with the story?"", but was really pleasantly surprised at how well-made this movie was, and I ended up loving it. Based on a novel (which I may have to read now), the storyline may appear to be a little out-there, but I can assure that most horror fans will enjoy this flick. The entire notion of the ""killer vines"" may sound corny and very un-scary (I was expecting it to turn out ridiculous myself), but the way they handled it prevented it from becoming over-the-top or cheesy. The CGI is pretty convincing here, actually, and there are a few scenes involving the vines that were actually pretty frightening. It's kind of a phantasmal idea, but if you can suspend your disbelief and remember that it is a fictional story, then this idea of plants retaining memory and coming to life can be pretty damn freaky. Put yourself in the characters' shoes, how would you react to something like that?Our characters are well-fleshed out too, and the psychological aspects of it after a few of them become ""infected"" by the vines were really interesting. They seem like fairly real people and it's easy to care for them. The cinematography is great here, and first-time director Carter Smith shows some talent. There are some great shots of the Mexican jungle, as well as the breathtaking views from the top of the monument (where the majority of the movie takes place). It has that tropical, exotic setting that contrasts with the horrific things that are happening within the story. This is quite a gory one too, which I wasn't necessarily expecting. There are more than a few cringe-inducing scenes (going as far as shocking leg amputations and graphic self-mutilation) that show quite a bit, but unlike 'torture' movies like ""Hostel"", I felt the violence was there for a reason. It wasn't just violence for violence's sake, and it actually served a purpose in the story.The acting was good as well, and it was surprising to see Jena Malone in a horror movie, but she was great. Jonathan Tucker (of the ""Texas Chainsaw"" remake), Laura Ramsey, and Shawn Ashmore make up our main characters, and all turn in solid performances. But above all things, I really think this movie deserves some credit for being something refreshing to the horror genre. It seems like all we're seeing lately are remakes of Asian horror movies, and a bunch of generic slasher flicks. The genre is running dry and there's very little originality anymore. However, ""The Ruins"" is unlike any horror movie I have ever seen, and in that respect, it's phenomenal. It takes some solid steps in the right direction, and it manages to dodge typical clichés, having you wondering what's going to happen next. It was really nice to go to the movie theater and see something different from what is the usual. The ending to the movie was a little off if you ask me, but the run-up to it was consistent in its intensity.Overall, ""The Ruins"" is a solid movie. If you are able to suspend some disbelief and take it as a story, then this can be a very rewarding and unique horror film. Some of the ideas are a little out- there, I'll admit, but it's handled well, and you'll be able to say you've never seen anything like it before. I myself was initially skeptical about the idea of 'killer vines', but I ended up loving this movie, if that tells you anything. There are some good scare scenes (and plenty of gore for all the gore-hounds), nice cinematography, and an unusually original plot. This one is definitely worth seeing, and is a prime example of creative, almost fantasy-laced horror at it's best. Surely the best and most original horror movie to hit theaters so far this year. 9/10.",The Ruins

This movie is based on the book by Oscar-Nominated Novelist/Screenwriter Scott B. Smith (A Simple Plan). Which he wrote the screenplay from this feature, although i never read the book. It seems that Smith wrote an somewhat completely take from his novel. Which most movies are, when they are adapted from book to screenplay. The cast are giving good performance, which some of the cast members especially Tucker (The Virgin Suicides) and Malone (Donnie Darko) done good pictures before. Rasmey is the standout here, which her character is completely paranoid and the most suffered as well. For a low-budget movie, this is extremely good looking feature. Which it was made for $8 million bucks.The R-Rated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes an enjoyable commentary by the director and editor of the feature, deleted scenes with optional commentary by the filmmakers, three featurettes and the original theatrical trailer. This was a modest hit at the box office, this should do much better on DVD and Blu-ray. ""The Ruins"" must have looked great on the big screen with Darius Khondji's terrific widescreen cinematography (The Beach, The Ninth Gate, Panic Room). One of the highlights also is the Production Designs by Oscar-Winner:Grant Major (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Frighteners, King Kong ""2005""). Which his sets are completely realistic looking. I couldn't say ""The Ruins"" is a great film, since Scott's screenplay does have its problems at times. But it is quite entertaining for a Horror movie that isn't dumb. It takes itself seriously unlike ""Cabin Fever"", which at times it does remind me of that movie. The filmmakers certainly payed tribute to the early works of Canadian Filmmaker:David Cronenberg.I only seen the R-Rated Cut, which it only has the R-Rated Cut at my local video stores here. I heard the Unrated Edition has an completely different conclusion and it is 7 minutes longer with the same bonus features. I am a fan of horror movies, i will probably pick-up the Unrated Edition of ""The Ruins"" sooner or later. ""The Ruins"" is certainly one of the better horror pictures of 2008. It is certainly worth seeing again. In someways, this was hard to believe that actor/comedian/filmmaker Ben Stiller (The Cable Guy, Reality Bites, Tropic Thunder) was one of the executive producers. Since Stiller was the original director of ""A Simple Plan"" at one point with Oscar-Winner:Nicolas Cage as the lead.

In the end they go, some more reluctantly than others. As they arrive at the foot of a pyramid nearly covered with bushes they are greeted by locals screaming in their native language and wielding guns, machetes, and bows and arrows. During an altercation, a local boy has some of twigs of the plants thrown in his face and that gets him shot on the spot. Horrified, our group runs up the pyramid. The locals in the mean time set up camp at the bottom, wives, families and all.Meanwhile on the top of the pyramid things start getting ugly. As the tourists look for a way out in vain, are attacked by the ruins, they get progressively get more desperate and mad. Any other movie would have turned our four teens into lunatics screaming at each other for an hour, ever since Blair Witch and reality TV defined entertainment as filming a bunch of fools insult each other. But this movie doesn't do that. On the contrary, one of the most enjoyable and realistic part of the movie are the relationships between the characters and how well the characters's personalities are developed. Especially delightful is the lovely Jena Malone's character. It was a joy two see the two girls interact like normal people.Things do get quite gory and brutal as the teens get infected in various ways and start losing their minds. There's some nudity, too. The story does stay away from some clichés, like a fiery conclusion or the anorexic girl hero who saves everyone by beating the bad guys to death.

54,fertilecelluloid,Horror with some depth,7,17 April 2008,"In ""The Ruins"", a dumb, selfish, hysterical b*tch (played by Jena Malone) indirectly causes the death of a German tourist, a little boy, and her own boyfriend. What is the inclusion of this character saying about women? Ask director Carter Smith, whose cinematic resume favors films about boys who like boys. Interestingly but not surprisingly, the male protagonists in this movie are strong and reasonably rational. Two American couples and a German follow a secret map to an old pyramid in Mexico. The pyramid, an impressive monument smothered in vines, is unofficially guarded by superstitious locals (Mayans, perhaps?) who don't take kindly to tourists. After Malone's ignorant behavior causes the German to get shot by the locals, the tourists retreat to the top of the pyramid where they face a different type of danger; their efforts to survive in a limited space make up the remainder of the movie. The enemy here is green and tentacle-like. It burrows into gaping wounds and has the ability to mimic sounds once heard. What could have been very silly in some hands is pulled off effectively here. Containing echoes of the Japanese masterpiece ""Matango"", this studio horror pic preys on our fears of bodily corruption and invasion. There is nowhere for our heroes to go, so we are invited to watch them as one would watch rats in a maze filled with traps. The prosthetic effects are convincing and extreme, and the performances are credible. The Malone character invites no sympathy because she's such a stupid waste of skin and bones; she's even depicted cheating on her boyfriend early in the peace. Why her friends didn't push her off the pyramid or leave her down the well she descends into at one point is anybody's guess.

Even worse, the youngsters soon realize that the vines that cover the pyramid, inside and out, are very much alive...and murderous, to boot. These vines can imitate the sounds that humans and cell phones make, and they have a nasty habit of devouring people, sucking out their blood, carrying them off, and crawling down their throats. Their spores, once inhaled, cause the plants to grow inside the human body, as well! What follows is an escalating exercise in horror and suspense that is most assuredly NOT for the squeamish viewer. There are indeed several scenes that are a bit hard to watch. In the first, one of the kids must have his infected legs amputated by the others; in another, one of the women must have her body slashed by a knife so that the plant life within her can be removed. The four leads--Jonathan Tucker, Jena Malone, Laura Ramsey and Shawn Ashmore--are all very effective here, and director Carter Smith does a wonderful job at ratcheting tension. My stomach was in knots by the end of this 90-minute thrill ride, a sure sign of an effective film and a job well done. As one of my reference books, ""Horror: 333 Films to Scare You to Death,"" puts it, ""Not since the seedpods of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' has chlorophyll been put to such terrifying use."" The film comes more than highly recommended by yours truly....",The Ruins
56,aharmas,The ruins are ruined,5,9 April 2008,"Somewhere there must be a director's cut of this, or an alternate version, or an extended version that must make more sense that the disjointed, chopped up, quite tame version of a book that seduces, ensnares, and repels you sometimes simultaneously. It's truly disappointing because the casting was pretty impressive, in particular Malone. There is some very impressive camera work, and a couple of moments where the audience is bound to jump, but the soul of the book is lost because the monster of the film is as scary as a plate full of cilantro.The beginning of the film is quite promising, and knowing the author adapted his own book, one keeps hoping it will retain its spirit, but when the first character is dismissed, in a very shocking manner, one wonders why the rest of the cast wasn't dispatched pretty much in the next two minutes, saving us some listless sequences.When reading the book, the scenes in the tunnel are some of the most horrifying and claustrophobic in memory, as we witness tragedy after tragedy, and some very horrifying moments. We've seen how scary scenes in these setting can be. For example, ""The Cave"" plunges you into hell, as darkness is as scary as anything can be, when well timed suggestive flashes can be. In ""The Ruins"", it looks like Christmas Trees were used to attack the girls, and let's not even go to the flowers' looks and sound special effects.I was wondering where this film was made since the humidity of the Yucatan peninsula seemed to have dissipated along with any signals of common sense. Is Hollywood capable of doing something right, even with original material? Or is it easier just to pillage what worked in the cinema before and do a half-hearted remake? On the other hand, if this works, maybe someone will make a sequel and fix everything that didn't work here. Now that sounds like some original thinking.",The Ruins
57,Jonny_Numb,The Doomed Generation,7,20 July 2008,"Of the many problems I had with Scott Smith's ""The Ruins,"" the biggest was the feeling that the book was little more than a bland, overextended B movie put to paperreadable, granted, but written in such a coldly technical style that I felt locked outside the characters throughout. And with no one to latch onto and sympathize with, the novel quickly became a droning descent into predictability, complete with an ending out ofyou guessed ita second-rate B movie.Heck, even the novel's central villaina superhuman tangle of carnivorous, flowering vinesfelt like '50s drive-in fodder (see ""The Return of Dr. X"" or ""Cthulhu Mansion"" for more instances of Plants Gone Wild), which would have worked had the book been going for a tongue-in-cheek tone. In a sense, the flatness of the human characters had a perfect match in the equally stoic foliage.But as strange as it may sound, my less-than-favorable reading of Smith's overpraised book led to an optimism toward the film adaptation. While Filmdom has trashed many a literary enterprise in the oft-clunky transition between page and screen, it seemed possible that a printed B-movie like ""The Ruins"" could only be elevated by the medium. And novice director Carter Smith (alongside an impressively capable cast) has delivered the goods: downbeat, desperate, and frequently horrific, ""The Ruins"" is a welcome challenge to a horror marketplace that has grown fetid with the blood of torture porn.One of the film's biggest pluses is its finely condensed screenplayrunning a relatively lean 93 minutes (in the unrated version), Smith himself has trimmed the fat of his own novel (including the wise elimination of one particularly worthless character) and amalgamated characterizations and plot developments into a satisfying whole. In turn, director Smith transforms the script into a deliberately-paced descent into sun-dried paranoia, where the titular Mayan locale is truly the last stop on a vacation into Hell. And the fact that happy-go-lucky spring-break tourists Jeff (Jonathan Tucker), Amy (Jena Malone), Stacy (Laura Ramsey), Eric (Shawn Ashmore)along with German Mathias (Joe Anderson)are so likable and rational in the face of an almost otherworldly adversary makes their individual descents (both physically and mentally) all the more harrowing.While the vines are a relatively spare instance of CG crossed with practical effects, and invoke warm memories of such other creepy-crawlers as ""Alien"" and ""The Thing"" (with one of the most squirm-inducing concepts paralleling the vine writhing inside a vulnerable body to venereal disease), the two Smiths don't allow it to cross the line into absurdity; instead, it is a mere complement to our vacationing young adults' dwindling hope as their numbers diminish. While the vine is painted as the primary enabler of the surgical amputation, self-mutilation, and murder on display, there are subtler implications of a lack of nourishment and too much sun doing the body and mind no favors when it comes to making well-reasoned decisions.The cast is quite deceptively composed of a group of up-and-coming lookers that portend a greater intelligence and emotional vulnerability that is refreshingly free of pop-culture savvy: while prone to outbursts of jealousy and panic, the characters remain level-headed and survival-minded throughout, which grows more stomach-churning as the days pass. Tucker's Jeff becomes an example of stoic cool dissolving into desperation as the situation deteriorateshis face becomes a horrifying mask for what is being held at bay inside. Malone and Ramsey, in addition to dirtying their good looks, avoid the conventional trappings of females in horror films, and are just as independent as the male characters.",The Ruins
58,truemythmedia,Sort of Funny...,4,30 October 2019,"The Ruins really just feels like a high budget SyFy channel production, with bad writing and underwhelming performances. There's no twists and turns or subverting of expectations, it's a straightforward, kind of boring survival film with not much to offer in terms of theme or insight.

The straight up evil a$$ plants or vines slowly make their presence known and that is about the time this movie gets fun. If there were a few more dollars pumped into this movie, as well as a good script scrubbing and DEFINITELY a different director, this could have been a much better film and maybe even a timeless cult classic. The vines are honestly super refreshing in these times we're living in where zombies, vampires and etc are pretty played out. This is an ""only if"" kind of movie.

61,raulfaust,Boulevard of Broken Dreams,8,3 February 2015,"Well, the last horror movies that I have recently seen proved to be really bad, and I couldn't remember the last time I enjoyed watching one of them. ""The Ruins"" is what made me believe in the genre again. The story is very surprising, avoiding the genre's clichés for most of the time. For instance, the awkward introduce between the four friends and the German guy would mean, in most films out there, that the German guy is going to lure them into some real trouble-- ""A Perfect Getaway"", ""House of Wax"" and ""Ghost Ship"" are classic examples of this. However, once they get in the ruins' ambient, we discover that there is no bad guy in their group. They're just a bunch of adventurers who try something new and end up fighting against their worst fears. The actors involved in this project are very professional, and it feels hard not to feel their pain, since there is a lot of panic in this story, and the actors portray it with their hearts. Overall and photography directing are also well executed, delivering beautiful scenes in the beginning-- and horrifying scenes in the ending. Furthermore, the people that portrayed the natives were very well chosen, and another reason why this movie feels so real. All in all, ""The Ruins"" is a GREAT unknown project that deserves a better rating, and it's surely a surprise for those who expect it to be another clichéd and campy teen movie.",The Ruins
62,Rob_Taylor,Not a bad effort!,7,21 June 2008,"I'm not really a big horror fan, so I don't normally watch the likes of Saw and its ilk. Though I'd hardly call those types of movies horror, more like gore movies. So it was without too much enthusiasm that I went to see the Ruins.Based on a book and adapted for the screen by the author, I imagine its a fairly faithful reproduction of the literary version. Of course, no one expects a movie to ever contain the depth of a book regarding plot, settings or characters, so I'm willing to ignore the questions that arose in my mind during the watching of the film. I'm sure the book answers those, and I'm sure one day I'll probably read it.And that, really, is probably the best praise I can heap upon the movie....that it makes me consider going out and getting the book to fill in the gaps left by the cinematic version. How are these plants the way they are? Why haven't the natives ever told anyone about the danger and (most teeth-grittingly) why hasn't the structure been spotted from the air or by satellite when it stands out in a little clearing. A clearing which is maintained by the aforementioned locals.Despite these questions (which, for all I know, are not answered in the book) the Ruins entertains fairly well. I admit to not fully paying attention to the early part of the movie, at least right up to the moment when the natives kill the first of the group to make the point that no one is leaving. Then I began to get more interested.Though the majority of the film is a little clichéd and obvious the whole does work surprisingly well. It entertains, which is more than I expect of most such genre offering. Though straying into the gratuitous gore field more than once, the film never loses sight of the human drama unfolding. What's more the main characters never do anything really dumb, which is of course what one normally expects from such films.A couple of things do spring to mind, again hopefully cleared up in the book I'll one day read. Firstly, why do the characters never think to try burning the vines? They have the means to do it. And secondly, if the natives are willing to kill to prevent the vines spreading, why do they simply not just kill the tourists who happen on the temple automatically? The vines do a handy job of disposing of bodies, so it could be seen as a mercy.These point aside, the film is worth a watch and the subject is fresh enough to give it a merit all of its own anyhow. Just watch out for the sequel (hinted at) if it does well at the box-office.",The Ruins
63,Sandcooler,"Makes no sense whatsoever, but some cool scenes save it",6,21 January 2012,"Horror/mystery hybrids like ""The Ruins"" always seem to come down to the exact same thing. The first half is going to be very intriguing and filled with chilling moments, the second half just sorta bails out and takes every possible shortcut to make the plot vaguely coherent. The makers seemed to have moved heaven and Earth to keep this show on the road, but ""The Ruins"" is still filled with the typical ""why don't they just...""-moments. The acting is also pretty weak overall, particularly the lead just has no facial expressions whatsoever. Is he scared, angry, bored? Who the hell knows. Fortunately you can manage to forgive the movie its shortcomings because it's so delightfully disgusting. People bleed a lot in this one, usually for far-fetched reasons but I'll take it. A visit to a slaughterhouse would probably be more child-friendly than this movie, but please don't try that out.

64,screenman,Little Crop Of Horrors,4,21 January 2012,"Well - it's another teen horror movie, so leave your brain at home.There's trouble with weeds. Ain't they a nuisance? They're just so-o-o persistent. Here, instead of checking into homicidal hostels, waxworks, or places inhabited by dream-demons and sundry psychopaths, our group of adolescent schmucks have wandered off into the jungle somewhere in central America. It's so dangerous being a teenager that I wonder any survive to keep our species up and running! And you just know this bunch are for the chop because there's pouting babes and macho guys. Hell; one of 'em's even wearing a baseball cap back to front, so you know his cards are marked from the start.The titular 'Ruins' are a single Mayan pyramid affair that's got a lot of weeds growing on it. But the weeds are polite, because they've left a gap on the staircase for doomed schmucks to ascend. The ruins are also surrounded by an even bigger bunch of Latino rednecks who force our schmucks onto the monument and won't let them leave on pain of death. As they would. In doing so; the movie sets itself up as a blatant piece of racist crap. Basically; if you're a central-American redneck; you're only good for superstitious terror, irrational behaviour, and murder. And if you're a Yank abroad, you're victimised innocence. Yeah; right. It's the underlying psychology to the USA's foreign policy.Up on top, there's been others. And it gradually becomes evident that the weeds have made a meal of them. So; you're either vegetable fodder or you get shot. And you can't afford to sleep or the plants will get you. Cue The Bodysnatchers. So now we spend some time going through all of the set-piece adolescent nonsense mixed with scenes of gratuitous horror and a whittling-down to one.Questions like - Where do the weeds come from? Why do they only live on the ruin? Why don't the rednecks drain a few gallons of fuel from their trucks and burn them up? Why not pop into town and get a couple of gallons of Paraquat instead of murdering itinerant tourists? Well; these belong in the same bin as - Why did I bother watching this movie? In my case, the emphasis is on 'watching' because the script is so banal and predictable that I just muted the sound for the last third. That's the way with teen movies; they might as well be silent for all the script is worth.It's said that the budget was just $8m, so I suppose in that regard it was at least value for money. But that's about the only thing that can be offered in its favour. I've heard it said also that adolescents actually think differently from the rest of the human race, and watching this movie is powerfully persuasive. Especially if they find it entertaining.The moral of the story is: if you're going in the jungle keep a 'flit-gun' handy, and keep away from rednecks of any persuasion. Better still; if you're adolescent, don't be a pouting babe or a macho dude, always keep in the company of sensible grown-ups, and never, ever wear you baseball cap back to front. Avoid these vices and you may grow up to join the long-term unemployed. Blessings upon you.",The Ruins
65,moviewizguy,Terror Has Evolved,9,13 April 2008,"A group of friends whose leisurely Mexican holiday takes a turn for the worse when they, along with a fellow tourist embark on a remote archaeological dig in the jungle, where something evil lives among the ruins.Yes, I have read the book and it was one of the few books that I read that were actually really good. Amazingly, this movie have pulled it off: It's better than the book. Probably because the book is nothing like the movie, yet the movie has some similar elements and gist of the book. Judging from the trailer, you might think it's another dumb, teen horror flick. This is where you're wrong. In fact, this movie is much more of a psychological thriller than a horror flick.For those who have read the book, you may feel upset that they changed it up so much, but I think otherwise: The movie changed up some flaws that were in the book: The characters are much smarter, things that I wanted to happen in the book, like the characters doing something differently, happened in the movie, and there's an alternate ending, which I think is so much better than the book so it really doesn't matter if you read the book first and then saw the movie, or vice versa.But, of course, this is my opinion. Unlike many horror movies, even as an R rated horror movie, The Ruins relies much more on tension and suspense than blood and gore, even though there is blood and gore in the film. This is one of the best movies created this year and one of the best horror film ever.However, I do think the characters in the book are much more sympathetic and lovable than in the movie. The movie is like 85 minutes and the book is 510 pages. Of course, the book added much more character development and other stuff than the fast paced movie. Still, I don't mind, because I still felt the characters were sympathetic and lovable. They're given great dialog and much more than 2-dimensional characters you see in most horror movies these days.Whether you have read the book or not, you'll be surprised at what is to happen in the movie. Some might call the ending a cop out, after what just happened, but I liked that ending much better than the one from the book. This messes with your head. This movie will not satisfy everyone, but it surely did for me. I just found the movie unfairly picked on because people, I assume, expected violence, gore, and nudity. The movie is better than that and it is.",The Ruins

67,Vomitron_G,Gripping and tense,8,12 August 2009,"THE RUINS... Not really a review - more some thoughts and comments that might be useful or fun if you've already seen the film. Or maybe not.Not that there was anything wrong with the brief character introductions during the first scenes of the film (they even were surprisingly decent for this type of film), but as soon as they arrived at the temple, the movie got me. It grabbed me, pulled me in and didn't let go. That doesn't happen too often, especially with the recently made horror films I've seen (I recall something similar happening when I watched Marshall's THE DESCENT for the first time). What struck me perhaps most about THE RUINS, is that it's not so much a film about killer vines (as we learn little about them), but much more about survival and how the characters react in their present circumstances. Kudos to the cast too, as they made their situation and actions believable. None of them even did or say anything remotely irritating (to me, at least). Kudos to Carter Smith also, for deleting that ""let's drink away our desperation"" scene (have you seen the extra's on the DVD?). That was exactly the redundant, clichéd thing I did not want to see in this film.I was actually thinking up a third possible ending, right on the spot as the final scenes unfolded. Now she escapes with the car. We see the Greeks, unknowingly reach the temple. End of film. I was thinking: Let her brutally crash the car and have the movie end abruptly. A brutal & sudden crash (like driving into a ravine or something), so the viewer is left baffled and with the sudden crash still resonating over the first seconds of the end credits. Leaving the audience a bit more shook-up this way, in a ""suddenly no-one survives after all, but not because of the killer vines"" kind of ending. No Greeks. The Greeks made the film somewhat end on a slightly funny note. After her boyfriend just having been arrowed to death, and her fleeing by car in a state of shock, the film didn't need that funny note at the very end. But then I saw the alternative ending (have you seen it on the extra's menu?), and I actually liked it better than the one with the Greeks. I can imagine some people calling the alternative ending too predictable & unoriginal or clichéd & uninspired. I say ""no"" to that, and think it's a great traditional way to end a horror film. They could have pulled it off, by having her crash the car against a tree or such, hitting her unconscious and fading to black (so the viewer has no clue if she's alive or dead for a few seconds). Then have the funeral epilogue-scene at the cemetery (alternative ending) come on.Sorry for this rather long assessment, but I just had all these thoughts about the ending stuck in my head.I'll quickly tell you something else. Something so idiotic, I was scratching my head while I read it. I know I'm not supposed to comment on other user-comments, but look at what one guy wrote in his summary line for his user-comment: ""Italian Giallo in American mainstream clothing"". I doubt if he knows what a Giallo film actually is, as he failed to point out any possible Giallo characteristics in his review. So maybe he got the word from this other guy, who wrote his user-comment 2 days earlier: ""Giallo with Depth...Not bad, But Not Great...At All."" Now, this guy is even funnier. Instead of elaborating on why exactly he's calling THE RUINS a ""Giallo with Depth"", he goes rambling on about Stephen King, comparing THE RUINS to several King adaptations. Next thing you know, he'll be saying King writes Giallo novels.Sad thing is, those two fellows don't even realize they might lead Giallo laymen up the garden with their improper use of the term. Sorry, and I'm not insulting anybody here, but I felt it appropriate to point this out.",The Ruins

LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. THE HILLS HAVE EYES. THE EVIL DEAD. And from the past couple of decades, HOSTEL. TURISTAS. WRONG TURN. JOY RIDE. And of course, the film to which THE RUINS will probably get the most comparisons, CABIN FEVER. Except instead of being set out in the middle of CHAINSAW territory, now it's an ancient sprawl of Mayan ruins. The fact that Four Beautiful Gen-X'ers are involved is about where the similarities end. Mr. Eli Roth, I'm sorry to inform you that you got served.Because just when you think that THE RUINS is really nothing more than just another yawn-inducing slasher movie, it takes this turn into THE OUTER LIMITS that you don't ever expect it to. And it's so much the better - and more terrifying - for that.Jonathan Tucker (HOSTAGE, Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR), Jena Malone (BASTARD OUT OF CAROLINA), Shawn Ashmore (the X-MEN series) and Laura Ramsey (LORDS OF DOGTOWN) star as two best friends and their respective boyfriends on vacation in Mexico, for a period of beaches, booze and ""knockin' da boots"" before Tucker's character, Jeff, takes the educational equivalent of the Bataan Death March: attending med school. The whole nightmare starts pretty simply, as nightmares often do in these things. The two couples meet cute with a German tourist, Mathias (Joe Anderson), whose own girlfriend, an archaeologist, has gone to her latest dig with Mathias's brother. He invites his new friends to come with, and since there's not much more excitement to be had, other than getting fit-to-puke drunk on too much cheap tequila, they take him up on his offer.Really. Bad. Move.The Fearless Foursome go to the dig site with Mathias and his friend, Dimitri (Dimitri Baveas) and nothing too alarming or remarkable happens along the way. It's when they get there that the fajitas really hit the fan. Because this set of ruins is no ordinary dig site. And if you have prepared yourself in advance for the ghost of some ticked-off Mayan god ready to rip out the hearts of these intruding Americanos, you are way off-base, my friend. What they find is more insidious, horrific and literally creepy than anything you've seen in a long, LONG time. Kudos must immediately go to Scott Smith, the author of A SIMPLE PLAN, for adapting his page-turner of a runaway bestseller into something that should make Stephen King green with envy. The core idea is not an original one, but the way Smith uses it and his depictions of how it affects the characters involved is Grade-A 100% pure classic horror. Director Carter Smith, with his major movie debut, is great at ratcheting up the scares and the gore quotient as he wrings some pretty genuine performances from his cast.But the nasty creepiness and dread are just the black frosting on this rotting cake. Dig underneath and you get some super bonuses: one scene that will forever make the ""hobbling"" scene from MISERY seem like a Sesame Street cakewalk, and one unbelievably goose-bump raising sequence that will forever have you getting freaked out about your cell phone. I can't tell you why...because the less you know about it, the more terrifying it is. Yes, the creative forces here make the most of milking the themes of isolation, hopelessness and impending death. But it's the HOW, not the why that sets THE RUINS apart from any other movie of its kind that's been made before or since.Right now, I would rank this one right up there with Neil Marshall's THE DESCENT as one of the Top Ten Best Horror Films made in this decade.Gee, in spite of all the remakes still ongoing, maybe there is still some hope for horror after all. I can promise you this much: THE RUINS is as good a description for what your nerves will be like by the climax, as it is the title of a very good horror thriller.",The Ruins

Was I wrong!This movie had me literally jumping in my seat more often than ""Deep Blue Sea."" Starting with the false alarm involving that cab driver's pit-bull. Right up to Jeff's self-sacrificing diversion for Amy. In between, I half-buried my face in my hands. Especially, in the scenes where Jeff, the pre-med student, has to perform those amputations.I didn't know whether he was being ruthlessly practical; a self-serving coward; or a little of both.The scariest moment of all, however, is the Big Reveal. The moment the audience gets to see--just like I did--that the vines in the temple's main tunnel aren't plant-like bugs. They really _are_ man-eating plants!!!And, the talent for mimicry they exhibit isn't as implausible as most people might think. Sundew plants have these bright yellow spots that look (and possibly smell) like nectar to passing flies and such. But, when they land, the stuff proves as adhesive as glue! And, the more the insect struggles to free itself? The more these little tentacular stalks pin it down until the sundew totally digests it.Now, I do have to warn you: the cast isn't made up of big names. Which is the reason I can't give this a perfect ten. Shawn Ashmore, who plays Eric, is hardly recognizable beneath his beard. And, Sergio Calderon (the Mayan chief), I haven't seen since he played a Central American river pirate, nicknamed ""the Coffin,"" on a rerun of THE A-TEAM!But, for those who like a well-balanced blend of suspense, terror, and gore?

They befriend a German tourist who invites them to join him to search his friend who had gone to a Mayan temple site, located in deep remote forests. They accept the invite and when they reach the Mayan temple, they are cordoned by a group of local Mayan people who do not want them to leave the site. On the site structure, the group of teenagers encounters the weeds, wildly growing on the temple, which can make any sounds they hear, can enter human body and can even consume humans in flesh and blood. One by one our teenagers are exposed to this terror and after many gruesome scenes we are at the end of movie  with only one survivor. Probably an indication of part 2! The cinematography of the movie is fantastic, there are also a few good (in-between) silent moments in the movie that the director Carter Smith has weaved in. There are also this curious moments in the movie that does not bore you to death.But the two biggest drawbacks are  one, why again a group of young teenagers? Two, I am sure the American youth is not as dumb as presented in the movie; there are scenes and dialogues did I really hear what this character said with you confidence and conviction  it simply makes you close your eyes and laugh loud? There are numerous moments like this that are literally stupid, dumb and mentally retarded, and poorly mostly goes to the mouth of central character  the hero  Jonathan Tucker, who  when he rants out his lines - looks a crack - straight out of an mental hospital.Overall, just for the new attempt of creating horror, I would go withan average rating.(Stars 5 out of 10)",The Ruins
75,stevelomas-69401,Rather forgettable,5,30 June 2019,Took me 30 minutes before I realized I'd seen this before. It's an utterly forgettable romp where identikit tourists get what they deserve. Also for some strange reason all the women's (and only the women's) clothes fell off. I think they should've complained to their tailors.,The Ruins
76,LazySod,Bad in any way a film can get bad and then some more,3,5 May 2008,"In the middle of a dense forest somewhere in Southern America there is a ruin of an ancient temple. A couple tourists on their last days of vacation want to see it, their curiosity triggered by the fact that the temple isn't listed in any books nor visible on any maps. After a wild night of partying they are led there by their guide and from there the film starts rolling.History has seen more films just like this one. This is after all a pretty standard recipe for a horror film: a number of ignorant people end up in a place where they shouldn't be and bad things start happening to them. And when I first saw the trailers for this film I knew it wasn't going to be something great - but it might have been good enough. Alas, when the film started it was clear from the word go that it was never going to use anything besides the well known clichés that make for the bulk of many of these films and that it wasn't going to use them well.Pretty poor acting, mediocre effects at best, laughter when fright is needed instead, plot holes as deep as the grand canyon. You name it, it was in there. All of it.3 out of 10 films that should never make it to the cinema",The Ruins
77,Rickting,Doesn't live up to its poster,4,30 August 2014,"I watched this one because I thought the poster was really creepy and effective. The movie? Not so much. This follows 4- believe it or not- likable young adults who along with 2 foreigners visit an abandoned Mayan ruin. They are quarantined there to prevent spreading the evil of the ruins. And the evil is, wait for it.... vines. Yes, vines. In the end, even though it's apparently based on a really good book this is just another horror film. It's not a terrible film, but it lacks anything remotely memorable. The only surprise is the cast, who give convincing and intense performances which make the film more powerful, and there are some good shots here and there throughout the film. The cast own the movie and the vines aren't used too much, preventing the film from falling into the B movie territory it nearly falls into when the plants start imitating the humans. But then there's a plot hole: Why do the vines only attack the humans from time to time? The problem with the movie is that it's quite disturbing and unnerving, but it isn't scary. Sorry, but it really isn't. The jump scares can be seen from a distance, while the various gory scenes and self mutilations make the film more nasty than enjoyable. The script is nothing special, and the film lacks structure, lacks proper tension building and there isn't really a finale. It feels a lot of the time like it's just vines screeching and chasing people, and this jarringly clashes with the dull script which takes itself way too seriously. The film has its moments and it's a good concept, but it's a nasty horror film with a jarring mix of B movie elements and horror conventions that lacks suspense. Does anyone remember this movie? 4/10",The Ruins
78,Nightman85,Much better than your typical pretty-kids-in-peril horror movie!,10,10 July 2008,"Spine-tingling survival horror film based on the novel by Scott Smith is one effectively shocking thrill ride.American college students on vacation in Mexico become stranded on an ancient Mayan temple where their lives are threatened by a surprising and deadly force.The Ruins surpassed all my expectations. When I first saw its trailer months ago I thought it would be another silly teen horror schlock movie, but after hearing so much praise for the novel it's based on I decided to give it a chance. I am very glad I did. The Ruins is a solidly disturbing and gruesome tale. Its story is nicely plotted and builds to fantastic suspense, bloodcurdling chills, and some squirm-worthy gore. Smith does a good job of adapting his novel for the big screen. Carter Smith's direction also lends the movie a dense atmosphere of dread that only enriches the creepiness. The Australia filming locations are lovely too and make for an exotic setting.The cast isn't bad either. The show is really stolen by leading man Jonathan Tucker, but Jena Malone is also memorable as Tucker's guilt-ridden girlfriend.All in all The Ruins is a winner for the horror genre. It has a kind of old fashioned sense to it, it reminds me of David Cronenberg's classic parasite horror films of the 70's. Yet, there's plenty of original qualities to enjoy in this gripping horror film. See it horror fans!*** 1/2 out of ****",The Ruins
79,danielmanson,I just didn't really see the point in the plot,4,4 June 2019,"As the title suggests I just didn't see the point in this film. It did not pull me in one bit, characters were hardly likeable and the villain. Killer weeds? Oh come on....No back story to the ruins, these vines, the characters or anything really. Nothing seemed to make sense!The killer weeds almost felt like a comedic gimmick. Nothing horror esc about itThere's a good amount of gore in this film, but beyond that I'm struggling to find any other positivesTo be honest 4/10 is quite generous and I'd probably give it a miss if I was you.

I noticed people saying the book is way better, not sure if they realise the screenplay was written by the same writer at the same time as the novel, which is interesting.

A bunch of stupid young people do stupid things and pretty much get themselves trapped and killed. It's one predictable situation after another, without a single surprise, and it ends with an anticlimax. There is just no payoff here.A note on the premise:
So the premise is that there is some Mayan pyramid on which killer vines grow. They infect you on contact and eat you from within. Now, the locals know about this. And what do they do about it? They don't tell anyone. They don't try to isolate the site. Instead, they just kill anyone who decides to hike there. And they bring their kids along. One of them has to be killed on the spot because it gets in contact with the vines. Oh, and none of them speak Spanish. Makes you wonder how they purchased their clothes, guns and ammo. It's just stupid. And the rest of the film is equally stupid.",The Ruins
82,ClaytonDavis,It Ruins the Mood,5,12 May 2008,"The 1st half of the year provides, very rarely, some touching motion pictures but no one should expect the ""guilty pleasure"" that is The Ruins to provide such a feeling. The Carter Smith directed film tells the story of four friends, out on a Mexican vacation when they meet a group of European students who stumble upon a map to visit one of the famous ruins. When they get there, they are bombarded by a secret society of natives that chase them up the ruin, (where there is a tent, rope, and everything they need to live for a few days) where they're surrounded for some strange reason. Performances are horrible, script is ridiculous, the concept is even more ridiculous and the ending leaves it opens for more ruins to come. Starring Jena Malone, in the most annoying performance ever in a ""horror"" movie, a nearly unrecognizable Shawn Ashmore who is even more pointless as he is acting at the moment, and a bunch of B-list nobodies that will probably show up for the sequel even though we shouldn't expect them to. As preposterous as the story is, we can expect no less.Past guilty pleasures like Showgirls and Candyman who have no character depth and go a whole lot of nowhere have the same premise and effect on the viewer. The gore is extra as I ever seen which makes the film kind of cool if you're in to that kind of thing but no dramatic chops to carry out of the theater with you.**/****",The Ruins
83,Shattered_Wake,Above-average modern horror that needed more risks,7,14 July 2008,"The film has a lot of things going for it before it even started. Between Jena Malone, a Mexican setting (filmed in Australia), an excess of gore (supposedly), and a few Americans in peril, it definitely stood a chance to be good. Also, for someone (like me) who dug Turistas, which is apparently crap to the rest of the world, this seemed like it would be an easy one to like.The Americans in question, obviously extremely trusting idiots, are enjoying their Mexican vacation when they meet a curious stranger (Joe Anderson) who tells them about an archaeological dig his brother went on. The group agrees to go with him (a dozen miles from civilization, mind you) to 'the ruins.' There, they come across a violent group of men who drive them into the ruins where they discover the vine-covered corpse of Mathias's brother. As their trip of horror continues, they discover more dead, leading them to realize that the secret lies with the murderous vines of the Mayan ruins.I'll admit. . . while the idea seems a bit ridiculous, the thought of murderous plantlife is pretty damn cool. Not exactly terrifying, as a few good shots of herbicide could probably help out a great deal. . . but, still cool. However, the weak script often cuts away from the suspense, right when it starts to get heavy, and turns instead to something else (like screaming flowers). The brunette couple (Jena Malone, Jonathan Tucker) put forth good performances, as I've come to expect from them. But, the blondes (Laura Ramsey, Shawn Ashmore) simply were not very good, so I would've preferred some of their peril to be placed upon the better actors. But, the effects were good, as was the direction. . .But, to be honest, I'm getting a little sick and tired of all of these 'horror of man' films, the ones that use the 'monsters' as the subplot and the 'true turmoil' lies within the good guys. It's being done far too much lately and this is another one. You're being attacked by murderous vines: your greatest enemy is not your friend. So, I wish writers would stop doing as such.Anyway, encompassing all elements, 'The Ruins' is a fairly well made modern horror with a few genuinely cool and scary elements. . . but, due to some poor writing, iffy acting, and lack of risk taking by the filmmakers, it ends as a mostly forgettable film. Not bad for a Friday night, though.Final verdict: 6.5/10",The Ruins
84,frankblack-79961,The bad reviews make me laugh. Solid horror movie.,8,12 April 2021,I haven't seen one negative review that isnt just someone whining about privilege or other nonsense. This is a solid gritty horror movie. Has all the elements and doesn't pull any punches. This kind of reminded me of Cabin Fever. All in all it delivers. Give it a watch.,The Ruins
85,hellholehorror,Too annoying,4,30 December 2017,It looked nice. The blacks were crushed and the whites too hot but that seems the style now and it looks fine. I would have rather seen it in high-def due to the lovely landscapes but I'm not that arsed. I liked the sounds actually. The sound effects were convincing and the music was unnoticeable (so it must have done its job). It has the slowest pacing. The most shocking scene is where the guy is shot but that takes place early on and is soon forgotten amongst rather boring plant attacks. To be fair there are some gross bits but it is not enough to stop is being boring. The characters are too annoying and you want them to die. There is no emotional attachment. It reminded me of Hostel (2005) in structure. For a horror film it is not scary. It's not even that gory or anything. It is boring though!,The Ruins

87,nitzanhavoc,Good and original basic idea. Unrated version has too much gore.,5,24 November 2012,"Being the Horror freak that I am, I always prefer watching Unrated/Uncut versions of films, so I can get the full experience. After watching The Ruins' Unrated version, I might refrain from doing the same in the future. I am not a gore fan, so I can't tell you how (or how not) the medical porn was exaggerated and pointless to the point of stupidity...The idea of the film (based on a book from what I hear) is nice and original. Unlike most horror films where the ""villain"" is either human or superhuman, in the Ruins the villain is part of nature itself. I likes that, and I think the film would've been just as good without closeup of an amputation surgery in field conditions.The view is remarkable (for all you nature fans), the acting is fine, but it feels like the idea wasn't capitalized on enough, and the potential wasn't used to its fullest. The gore simply attempted to disguise or deny the fact that this film, while having a good idea on which to be based, simply wasn't all that horrific.Then again, I did enjoy watching it and did find myself curious as to what would happen to the characters and how the story would end. I think I might even want to read the book. So basically, I can't really recommend that you watch The Ruins nor that you avoid it. It has its moments, but it definitely isn't one of the best.",The Ruins

(I haven't seen the other versions).But it was immediately clear what was going to happen as soon as the best-looking young man (as usual) was killed. Never be the good-looking guy in a horror film.But what I didn't expect was that the effects would be so ridiculous. It's an over-reliance on CGI just because it's there. The plants, whether in the ruins, or inside someone's skin, were like from the 90s. What bargain-basement software did they use? And their mimicry of technological and other sounds was not believable. While a plant might do that, it probably wouldn't flutter its stamens at you. I actually broke out laughing. It should have been done with the leaves somehow, or some new structures, or just omitted altogether, because you don't really need it for the story (not even the cellphone thing).As others have noted, our heroes didn't bother to attack the plants or defend themselves in any common sense ways. They died because they were stupid. That's not much of a horror or psychological thriller.",The Ruins

This really tried to be good and the actors did the best they could with the terrible script. Don't watch this unless you want to be scared of plants, that's right plants!!! Sorry I realize that is a spoiler but that is it folks a vine is what you are supposed to be scared of! I might have read the book that supposedly Stephen King thought was good. I hope he skips this joke of a film. Try watching some good horror movies. Oh wait they are all PG-13 pieces of garbage. We finally get an R-rated one and it blows! I don't know when we will get a good Horror film again, but I sure hope Clive Barker or Wes Craven can come up with some NEW horror material. That' right I want some NEW material, but as long as all these dang kids keep going to watch all these re-hashed flicks, the rest of us are going to have to continue to endure them! It is because of terrible movies like this that remakes keep happening. Although I didn't like this (at all) I was glad to at least try out a NEW horror flick.

As they reach the ancient pyramid overgrown with vines, they are unable to find Mathias's brother and almost immediately are confronted by some very angry locals, presumably Mayans hell bent on preserving their heritage. A small bribe is offered to the Mayans in the hope it will placate them, but financial reward is not what they want. Soon they find themselves trapped on the pyramid unable to escape, the Mayans seem reluctant to climb the pyramid, so that means our tourists are safe, right?wrong. Yet another tourist in danger flick, damn those foreigners why can't they just be nice. The Ruins though has a twist in the tail, a preposterous twist that none the less, I found rather enjoyable. The film also boasts some decent gore which I didn't expect from it at all. There is the usual annoying teenage banter you might expect, but that soon disappears when the action starts. Visually the film is excellent, taking great advantage of some pretty stunning locations, not the best film of the year, but an enjoyable way to pass 90 mins.",The Ruins
92,Scars_Remain,I Am Shocked That People Like This Movie,1,5 April 2008,"A 7.3?!?! Really?!?! Did I see the same movie?!?! I absolutely cannot figure out what people saw in this atrocity. I truly am utterly blown away after reading the reviews on this site and seeing what people on the horror board are saying about it. The consensus in the theater seemed unanimous since everyone was laughing at how absurd the premise and everything was. I truly don't get it. I feel like the script could have been written by someone in junior high, and probably was.Where do I start? The acting was nothing but terribly sad, there's nothing more or less I can say about it. The story was idiotic and the dialog was even worse. The characters were so unbelievable that it seems like no effort was put into them at all. I would honestly love to see the Mystery Science Theater 3000 guys tackle this one because the jokes about it could go on and on, much like they did in the theater I was in. Usually it bugs the hell out of me when people are talking in the theater but it didn't tonight because I didn't care about paying attention to this travesty. And lastly, this movie had pretty much no suspense. Isn't that what a horror movie is supposed to be based on? I guess the producers didn't know that, along with a lot of other things.Don't make the mistake I did, just say no to this movie. Don't ever see it.

93,gary-444,"A Dismal, Empty Effort",2,30 June 2009,"This is Director Carter Smith's debut full length feature and that inexperience destroys this film.87 minutes is the ideal running time for a Horror, but in truth there is barely half an hour's worth of material here. The premise of the story, the eponymous novel by Scott Smith is simple and fine. But Carter Smith is wholly unable to translate the layered horror of the page onto the screen.The Ruins follows two American couples, just out of college, enjoying a pleasant, lazy beach holiday together in Mexico as they go off with new found friends in search of some remote Mayan ruins, site of a fabled archaeological dig.However the characters are underwritten, and the performances lack depth. Frankly we don't care whether they live or die.Once stranded on the Temple, a relatively small pyramid style structure, there quite literally isn't anywhere to go, and as this happens early on in the film this is a problem.Graphic, horror gore quickly replaces plot in order to create any impact or momentum.The basic Horror principles that what you don't see is more horrific than what you do see, as is the threat of what MIGHT come, are eschewed out of sheer desperation.The climax to the story is so clichéd all dramatic tension is lost and the final frame would have been thrown contemptuously aside by the Tutor of a first year film studies student.Lush photography and a fine setting do not compensate for a feature length failure.",The Ruins

And when there, thats when the plants decide to take them out, mimicking cell phone noises, humans, and ancient Mayan dead people.Nothing was really scary about the movie and was not even entertaining.

95,PoisonKeyblade,An incredible descent into madness,10,6 April 2008,"The Ruins by Scott Smith was one of the most disturbing and intensely terrifying books I've ever read. It was a major page-turner and I just couldn't seem to put it down. From beginning to end, the novel captivated me with its extremely well-developed characters and its theme of human nature getting the better of people. Obviously, I had majorly high expectations set for the film version of The Ruins after I read the book; it was a book so stunning with its vivid detail that it would make the perfect movie. Not only did the film meet my expectations for an adaption, but it completely surpassed them and ended up being simply incredible, another masterpiece of modern horror that should fit snugly beside the likes of Grindhouse and The Descent. Jena Malone (Donnie Darko), Jonathan Tucker (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003), Shawn Ashmore (X-2: X-Men United), Laura Ramsey (She's the Man), and Joe Anderson (Across the Universe) are the main players in this character-based survival horror/thriller.Even though I knew the movie was in good hands when I saw the author of the book had written the screenplay, I was still a little unsure as to whether or not The Ruins would make for an amazing movie because the best part about the book was the character development. If we didn't care about these characters, then really, what was the point? I was quickly proved wrong when really the first forty minutes or so consists of just character development. The book gave each character all sorts of little quirks, and seeing them so wonderfully displayed on the big screen just gave me goosebumps. Fans of the book will probably either love or hate this movie, depending upon whether they can accept some of the changes that were made. The ending is different, and the fates of all the characters have been switched around, but it is largely the same story general focus as the novel. In most scenes, it was better for the changes, and there was really only one scene in particular that I was a little irritated they changed. It was overall very effective, and it seems like even the movie would keep fans of the book on their feet. Scott Smith's script is top-notch, with dialogue, characterizations, and everything. He did an awesome job translating his book onto the big screen.You know when you see a movie, and as you're watching it, you just know that you are experiencing a one-of-a-kind classic? The Ruins is one of those movies. It's smart, it's sassy, it's disturbing, but best of all, it's one-of-a-kind. As mentioned before, The Ruins shares vaguely a few similarities with other films, and it has something of a Lord of the Flies vibe to it since the book also did, but it's an incredibly original movie. The reason it works so well is because all of the aspects that are needed to make a phenomenal horror film are intact here. This isn't another one of those run-of-the-mill slasher movies where a group of teens are stalked. This movie feels real because of how well the characters are written and how believable the actors are. The concept is far-fetched, but because it is so grounded in reality its all the more terrifying. These are real people in horrific situations, and what they do to survive are all incredibly human actions. They all lead to their own downfall; everything else is just a factor. That is what makes the movie amazing: the survival factor. I also loved that even though it is played completely serious, that the film really was a huge throwback to the 70s and 80s horror films, loads of fun and extremely graphic. It was also really cool how the audience knew only what the characters know, except for of course the very beginning of the movie. In the book, that was one of my favorite aspects, and I thought that the movie did a really great job of capturing that. There was never too much explained, and the movie really kept to the book's general tone of hopelessness.The main characters, aside from being expertly scripted, were also expertly acted. Jena Malone probably gave my favorite performance of the movie as Amy, who on the surface seems to be a whiny crybaby, but she is actually an extremely layered character who grows internally as the situation on the Mayan temple gets more and more out of control. Jonathan Tucker, who is one of the most underrated actors of the decade, was a great choice for Jeff. Laura Ramsey probably had the most difficult role as Stacy, who was an incredibly likable character towards the beginning of the movie, but then is much more difficult to play in the second half. She pulled off the role as good as she possibly could have, with all the gusto of a young Jamie Lee Curtis. Shawn Ashmore couldn't possibly have been a more spectacular choice for Eric, who was one of my favorite characters in the book. Joe Anderson, a fan favorite and up-and-comer since last year's Across the Universe, was barely recognizable (and in a good way) as Mathias, who actually had a much larger role in the book. His accent was spot-on, and I loved him to death once more. He has a certain charisma about him, and when you see him in pain, you almost want to just burst out in tears.I simply cannot reiterate enough how much I absolutely loved this film. If you haven't yet gotten the chance, seek out one of the best, most intelligent, and most original horror films in years, The Ruins. It subtly creeps up on you and, after the movie is over, you feel almost as if you're covered in bugs or plants. It makes you just want to hop into a shower. I know I'll never look at vines the same way again.",The Ruins
96,jmbwithcats,If the plants don't kill then the movie will,3,8 April 2008,"So I saw that new installation of the ""Kids lost in a dark cavernous place"" horror genre entitled ""The Ruins"" this week and here's what I thought.I must admit I went into this movie expecting a pretty stupid movie and it delivered in spades. I've become somewhat jaded by the Hollywood horror community over the last decade, and this movie was no exception.The movie begins in a Cannibal Holocaust style fly over the jungle, sans the amazing theme music the former had, but I digress.The story takes us to some ruins which the people of the area are intensely superstitious about. Going so far as killing one of their own simply because he touches a plant from the area of the ruins.The group have no recourse but to go into the ruins, not only to escape the unapproachable natives, but because two of their friends have fallen in while investigating and have been hurt. A rescue ensues, which leads the group deeper into the ruins.I for one have never been a big fan of movies that take place in dark caverns or ruins, simply because I watch a movie to see what's going on. A movie that's all dark and hazy is not my idea of entertainment. Raiders of the Lost Ark was a great balance of these elements, alas it is not a horror film so I digress yet again.I don't however remember ever seeing a movie about plants (who interestingly look a lot like marijuana plants with red flowers), that so stealthily penetrate the victims, growing on clothing then branching out and inward to effectively constrain, eat and kill their prey. For that I really liked the originality of the premise. And it begs the question, what is it about these ruins that cause these plants to be, and what they are exactly, and how our characters can possibly escape.Sadly this is not only not explored, neither are the ruins explored. In the final analysis the ruins are nothing more than the stage for our little play, nothing more.The last movies i watched that had to do with dark caves of this genre was The Descent and The Hills Have Eyes 2. The Descent while very good and well developed, better developed than The Ruins had a profoundly unbelievable enemy, but I let that go because the movie was excellent. The Hills Have Eyes 2 was complete trash. So I ask myself, in the trilogy of recent horror films of the cavernous excursion series, this would fall just below The Descent but well above The Hills Have Eyes 2.What saves the characters of this film are the decently talented actors: Jonathan Tucker (The Virgin Suicides, 100 Girls), Jena Malone (Donnie Darko, The Ballad of Jack and Rose), Shawn Ashmore (X-Men), everyone does an exceptional job, those I didn't mention I simply have not seen in other titles and feel I am not qualified to speak about them. They however all do a terrific job in the movie, I mean honestly who knows how anyone would respond in such a situation? There are many questions raised by this movie, and none seem to ever be answered and that is this films only real flaw. There just is no story.Remember how I mentioned Cannibal Holocaust earlier? That film also had an amputation scene and that person died very soon after giving the film a rather cosmic futility effect. One might surmise that The Ruins is hugely inspired by Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust. At least there are some strong parallels.Honestly the only thing The Ruins lacked was any semblance of a story. It was an exercise in self mutilation and self annihilation.I would imagine the natives would not ever have left the place so accessible be but rather build some kind of barrier around the place, I mean why is the place so accessible anyway, and what keeps the plants from attacking en masse throughout the film? And why would the natives even bring children anywhere close to the place? Honestly one must sympathize with the natives, after all if any spores got away from the ruins they could and would likely cause the extinction of mankind very quickly.For a movie so lacking depth or logic, it was somewhat enjoyable on a brain dead level. In the end though one is left with the feeling that one has just endured quite possibly the most pointless exercise in the horror genre of film in the last decade.",The Ruins
97,eddax,Killer plants that aren't silly.,8,27 May 2009,"I had been so looking forward to this movie ever since Stephen King started raving about it (it's on his Top 10 Movies of 2008 list) that I almost felt cheated when it started out as though it would be yet another gorgeous-college-kids-doing-stupid-things-that-get-them-killed horror. But while the movie does come dangerously close to that line a few times, the actors and characters manage to generate enough sympathy that I felt bad for them, as opposed to wanting to hasten their deaths.Killer plants can either sound really cool or really silly, depending on how much of a horror fan you are (or at least, how much of an optimist you are). I'm a huge horror fan and I'm glad to say that the plants don't disappoint. The effects are solid and the creepy creepers get in some good scenes, with one particularly memorable one being about its flowers and the kids down a deep, dark, temple shaft - I shouldn't say more.There is gore, and it's gross, but not in a bad, gratuitous way, like with torture porn. It's appropriate gore (lol) for the premise, and it's disturbing to look at but hard to turn away from.The actors are really hot, which isn't necessarily a good thing for horrors as it might lead to stereotyping the movie as ""B,"" but surprisingly, the two leads had just come off solid turns in acclaimed movies (Jonathan Tucker, from In the Valley of Elah, and Jena Malone, from Into the Wild) and I can't help but to wonder why they took a step backwards in their career (well okay, it was probably for the money).I could guess how the movie would end long before it did, so that was kinda disappointing. Maybe that's what Stephen King likes, since I knew exactly how The Mist (which he wrote) would end too. Predictable conclusions are so deflating; I always think one should come out of a movie with a high but such endings pretty much reduces the high to ""meh,"" and it takes a bit more effort to remember why I liked the movie (if I did).",The Ruins
98,ebossert,Hollywood Simply Cannot Make A Good Horror Film Anymore,4,29 August 2008,"I had a small window of down time inbetween my East Asian movie rentals (the only countries that make consistently good films nowadays), so I rented a few American products this week as filler material. The first was ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) (a hopelessly overrated trainwreck that started off well but ended horribly) and the second was ""My Sassy Girl"" (2008) (a disgraceful remake of the single greatest romantic comedy ever made). I must be a glutton for punishment, because I decided it was time for a third excursion into the realm of bad film-making  enter ""The Ruins"" (2008). Anyone familiar with recent trends in American film-making knows that the horror genre has been on life support for a few decades. There have been a few good ones, but the States have been mostly producing heaping quantities of excrement, leaving other countries to pick up the slack. I heard mostly favorable reviews about this movie, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I'll give ""The Ruins"" credit for one thing. At least it tries to do *something* different  killer plants that sing cell phone tones is most definitely not a cliché, which is a good thing. The problem is that this movie ends up duplicating too many aspects of poorly made horror films. 1. College kids getting into trouble on vacation  are there any dangerous places *within* the U.S. anymore? Apparently not. 2. Typical college morons who drop sexual innuendos and puke in the morning after getting drunk  are these people really that narrow-minded in terms of having fun? There are other things to do in this world. 3. Evil ""foreigners""  are there any good people that live *outside* of the U.S.? Apparently not. 4. Reliance on gore and blood derived from superfluous, unnecessary events. 5. Character stupidity. These clichés easily overpower any novel elements in this movie because the filmmakers take the premise and go NOWHERE with it. It would have been nice to have a bit more strategy between the protagonists, the killer vines, and the human protagonists. Fire could have been used to fend off the vines (which should have used more interesting, effective, and numerous attacks) and the plants themselves should have been used more often by the protagonists to attack those ""evil"" village people. Other than the ""cell phone scene"", there's nothing here that's memorable. This movie spends WAY too much time showing make-shift surgery scenes to fix injuries to the characters. This gets very old and very boring because its lazy film-making. There are a million different possible scenarios you can do with killer vegetation, yet you waste almost all of your time on torture scenes? That's incredibly STUPID scriptwriting. As such, ""The Ruins"" does not deserve the distinction or label of an ""innovative"" movie. It uses heaping quantities of genre clichés and abuses an interesting premise as a mere gimmick to lure people like myself (who like novelty and general weirdness) to watch it. Even so, as a brainless slasher flick, this could have been good. There are some nice gore shots where characters get their limbs slowly severed, but that's less than 10 minutes of a 90 minute film. The other 80 minutes are rather boring.This film treaded mediocrity during the entire first hour in the sense that I didn't feel completely irritated by it. Then the psychological twist happens. If there's one thing Hollywood simply cannot do, it's an effective psychological twist (primarily because it requires some thought to execute properly). This movie is no exception. One of the girls inaccurately ""hears"" her boyfriend having sex with the other girl, then she goes ""off her rocker."" This sequence is vintage Hollywood in its lack of style, its use of crude vulgarity (i.e., ""I heard you fu*king! I heard you fu*king!""), and it's complete avoidance of interesting themes and concepts. After that scene, I was completely irritated. On a side note, I find it very interesting that so many of these recent ""vacation death"" films (e.g., ""Hostel"", ""Turistas"", ""The Ruins"", etc.) play off of your typical American's xenophobic fear of other cultures. You see, my fellow Americans think that ""different"" means ""evil"", which is why they don't like to read subtitles or watch movies in other languages. Hollywood knows this, so they churn out movies like ""The Ruins"" that take that fear to the next level. I'm just waiting for another crappy horror film that blends xenophobia with a Japanese remake  perhaps a film where the characters watch a cursed non-English movie with subtitles, then die seven days later. I'm sure that Roy Lee and all of his talentless buddies have it in the pipeline somewhere. To be honest, I really am sick and tired of people who extrapolate the incompetence of Hollywood horror movies across the entire world. The horror genre is arguably at its strongest level in its entire history. Sure, you don't get many Gialli or Exploitation films anymore, but if you look into recent releases from countries like Japan, China, South Korea, Thailand, France, and Spain, you'll find a MASSIVE selection of good horror films (see my User Profile for examples). We're talking HUNDREDS of entertaining titles that have been released from the mid-1990s to present. It's a real shame that the horror genre is dragged through the mud by a bunch of hacks from Hollywood, because it truly is the most dynamic and intelligent genre of film that exists today.",The Ruins
99,Jacques98,Doesn't the horror genre deserve better than this?,1,3 September 2008,"My review is divided into questions that you really should ask yourself: 1. Plants eating people have been done HUNDREDS of times. It's been used by Nintendo in everything from Mario to Zelda to Metroid Prime. It's been used in plenty of low-budget 50's movies, on par with the lowest of the Godzilla franchise. And this brings it to a whole another level of cheese with plants that TALK. I've known no one who walked out, but I know a lot of people who absolutely broke out in hysteric laughing during parts of this movie. I was one of them. Doesn't the horror genre deserve something a little better than this pile of laughable crap? 2. The characters easily could have been copy/pasted from Hostel or Wrong Turn or Wolf Creek or any other movie with collage kids with bad luck. Yet it's called ""characterizing"" when the movie takes hours of your time to tell you clichés that hundreds of characters before have had? Don't you ever wish a movie had characters that weren't just forgettable pieces of meat with legs? 3. This was not gory. A guy cuts his skin off. Oh, my! (Not.) A guy gets his legs broken. Oh my! Gasp! (Not.) I have shown movies like this to my mother who hates everything to do with horror because it makes her sick, and she said: ""I've seen PG movies worse than that! Why was it rated R?"" So, why was it rated R? 4. Here's the only plot the movie/book has: collage kids drink, have sex, get naked, cruse, bleed, and eventually die. This is possibly the most typical example of a cheap, thoughtless horror movie, yet people call this ""mature""? What the . . .? 5. I do not think I have ever seen something less original sense I watched A Beautiful Mind. Haven't you ever sat there and wished the horror genre, easily the most diverse genre out there, would do something . . . well, diverse? Something truly original?I just wish more horror movies would have actual horror, not just cheap collage parties put on film with a few splatters of fake blood tossed around.1/10",The Ruins

It is made for entertainment and oh boy! It entertains throughout its ninety minute run time, provided one doesn't take the movie too seriously. The Ruins is a typical movie teens would fall in love with.The choice of shooting location for the movie was excellent, as it makes The Ruins almost believable, err ok not almost, I agree. Screenplay though filled with loopholes, punches above its weight to keep things interesting most of the time. Cinematography is par. Production design, costumes and music is good considering the budget. Makeup is is top notch if one puts in a keen eye on the happenings. Editing is very good, thanks to the editor for keeping it short and neat. Acting surprisingly is not bad at all for a movie of this type, though nothing is on the extraordinary side, it's practically decent.Overall, if one wants good entertainment and is willing to turn a blind eye on some spectacular logical loopholes, The Ruins will definitely work in your favour. Though the movie is made for young people, it wouldn't be a complete disaster if one doesn't expect too much out of the movie. Grab some popcorn and get ready for a crazy ride for some B grade entertainment for 90 minutes, that won't leave you disappointed.

103,Mr Parker,Heartattack and Vine,8,4 April 2008,"Well, let me tell you... I had a feeling this movie was going to be good. I did not expect it to be as good as it turned out to be. This movie has it all and has it in spades. You want gore? Check. Suspense? Oh yeah. Scary? Let me put it to you simply: this is a movie that will make you think twice about going to Mexico and doing a little sightseeing in the forest. It's a very grim movie and not for the squeamish but still it doesn't stop this from being one of the most entertaining times I've had at the movies this year so far. The acting though, is what makes this one head and shoulders above most other fright flicks I've seen in years. There was not one bad performance in this and it really helps to sell a premise that could've crashed under its own weight at any second. The idea of it might sound a little silly but I was totally engrossed in it from the moment the crap hits the fan in the film. You feel the despair of the characters in this story and you really, really want to see them make it out of this in one piece. In the end, you know how I know this movie was really good? What kind of proved it in a weird way? The audience's reaction. I saw it in a packed theater tonight, filled with dozens of teenagers and none of them, not one, had any smart ass comments during the film. You know how a character in a film will deliver a heartfelt line of dialogue only to be received by the audience with snorts and yells of disgust? It didn't happen once. When I glanced at the audience behind me, all of them were grabbing their dates or the armrests of their seats. This is one to see in a dark theater with a crowd.You may have noticed I was a little light on story details with this review. Trust me, the less you know going into it, the more you'll dig it.

104,Quebec_Dragon,Stupidity ruined the Ruins,4,11 June 2009,"I certainly hope the book this is inspired from is better than this poor attempt at an horror flick. I remember a quote from Stephen King on the cover saying this was ""the best horror novel of the new century"". The movie makes me doubt that very much but who knows. Books are indeed almost always better than their film adaptation. The funny thing is that the screenplay is attributed to the writer of the book, Scott Smith. My main beef here was that the characters, particularly the girls, acted too stupidly. Some of it can be explained away by nerves or growing insanity but still. My other big problem was with the menace of the ruins. I didn't buy it. It felt ridiculous. Perhaps it's less of a problem imagining it while reading the book, perhaps. There were a couple of horrific scenes that worked really well (one medical involving legs) but a few effective scenes do not make for an overall satisfying horror experience. The acting was mundane with the actor playing Jeff being way too stiff and unemotional. This is worth a rental at best when there is nothing better left to see in the horror section.Rating: 3.5 out of 10",The Ruins

106,happyendingrocks,"The book is better, but this film certainly does it justice",8,3 October 2009,"The old adage ""the book is always better"" seems like a no-brainer in the case of Scott Smith's masterfully-rendered The Ruins, which I devoured over the course of two nights of chain-smoking. Smith's tome is one of the best horror novels I have ever read, and certainly the best piece of genre pulp thus far this century. With such an original and genuinely terrifying story in place, it would be pretty hard to screw up a movie adaptation, unless the film-makers chose to change crucial pieces of Smith's immaculately constructed puzzle.Thankfully, another timeless adage, ""don't fix what ain't broke"", comes into play in this film, and by sticking almost doggedly to what Smith already fleshed out in his tense and brilliant pages, the movie is guaranteed to be a successful exercise in horror. While The Ruins doesn't accomplish the impossible task of surpassing its source material, it remains faithful enough to the book to please fans of the text, and presents most of the salient elements in a way that should effectively lure in non-readers.Since one of the main characters in this piece is the titular Ruins, location is key. On that score, the film-makers capture exactly what I had envisioned while I was reading the book, and the secluded set is a perfect locale for the supernatural happenings within. It's best not to divulge too much of the horror our hapless backpackers encounter atop and within said Ruins, but the film does a great job of bringing even the most fantastical elements of Smith's text to visual life. The spot-on casting and locations and the well-shaped mythology bring a sense of realism to the affair, and though most of us have not ever had occasion to be afraid of plants, there is a genuine sense that what we're seeing could conceivably happen under the circumstances our characters are plunged into.The presence of the Mayan natives and their cold but necessary vigil was a genius aspect of Smith's book, and helped elevate The Ruins beyond a standard ""and then there were none"" monster story. That thread is rendered magnificently here, and, again, the authenticity of this scenario elevates the fundamentally realistic nature of the tale. Since The Ruins deals with an implied folklore set within a distant locale far removed from the safety of the viewer's easy chair, we have to concede to the possibility that these Ruins may well exist somewhere, and the idea of a malevolent life-force dwelling amongst this temple is certainly no harder to swallow than many of the religious mythologies so many people base their lives on.Of course, the time constraints of a film make some careful editing necessary, and since the film-makers opted for a lean and tidy 90-minute scare-fest, some of the more intriguing elements of Smith's book are left in the cutting room. The vocalizing of the vines, for instance, is only touched on here, while the book wrings several well-plotted scares out of this device. The film, in fact, makes this issue a bit confusing, and viewers without the benefit of knowledge of the original story may scratch their heads a bit when a noteworthy scene from the text involving a perception of infidelity is merely glossed over here.Also, our characters aren't nearly as well-defined here as they are in the text. No surprise there, but it's a shame that the film relegates our two female leads to standard horror film hysterics instead of exploring the more human and complete range of emotions showcased in the book. It's also frustrating that the idiocy of one of the two women ultimately leads our sextet to their doom. I'm pretty sure the catalyst for the horror in the book wasn't a girl angling to take a picture of one of the Mayan nobles while he's shouting at the group trying to protect them. I'll admit I could be mistaken about this, but if this sequence is as crucial in the book as it is here, it certainly didn't read as ridiculously as it unfolds on the screen, where we're supposed to consider taking a photograph a rational reaction for a woman to have when a burly stranger with a gun is shouting heatedly at her and her friends in a language she can't understand.These are all rather small complaints, and the fact is, even without the benefit of the book, The Ruins is a satisfying horror film with a great story, original twists, several gruesome scares, and some truly unsettling violence to please the gore-hounds in the audience. We can only hope that Scott Smith's wonderful tale is left alone after this, though. Smith never explains WHY or HOW the hideous presence is there, and the film wisely carries his ambiguity. This sense of the unknown makes the whole ordeal that much scarier, and any subsequent exploration of the being dwelling in The Ruins would undoubtedly deal with these elements, which would strip away the myth-based trualities that drive the terror. So, note to direct-to-DVD film producers: please don't ruin The Ruins by making it a franchise.Yes, the book is far superior. But if you only have an hour-and-a-half to spend with this haunting tale, The Ruins is a great ride, and definitely not an embarrassment to the tome that spawned it. As any Stephen King fan will tell you, this is a rare enough accomplishment to merit recommending this film wholeheartedly.",The Ruins

Whether a movie ever lives up to the book is always up for debate. Some of the things from the book are shifted around and changed but it does still keep its framework and essence.""The Ruins"" is the story of four American college kids who are vacationing in Mexico, when they decide to go with a few others to visit some ancient Mayan ruins. These ruins are covered with a green flowering plant that seems to be alive. Director Carter Smith and the filmmakers had the tough job of making these plants scary. With any horror movie it's only as scary as your killer, case and point Jason, Freddy, Michael Myers. So how do you make plants scary? Sound effects, CGI, and some pretty decent acting.As the group reaches the sacred ruins they are surrounded by a bunch of angry and armed locals who since they came in contact with the plants are not allowed to leave. The locals scream at them in a language they don't understand. Just like in Eli Roth's Hostel movies, the filmmakers really make the point that today's young Americans that venture into other countries have this cocky air of invincibility. When things start to go wrong they basically think, somebody has to be looking for us, were Americans. And people wonder why some countries around the world hate us. They are suppose to be meeting there German friend Mathias's brother, who is researching the ruins. His stuff is there but he isn't. There is a pulley system to lower people down into the darkened abyss of the ruins and when they hear a cell phone ring, Mathias is convinced it's his brothers. As he is lowered down the rope breaks, we then come upon what I've said before is my favorite disgusting injury, the compound fracture. This is where the real horror starts as they wake up the next morning to realize that the plants vines are slithering into their wounds. The vines act like parasitic leeches drawn to blood. They move just under your skin like worms. Eeeewwww! Then the real blood and gore is put into motion. They cut of Mathias's legs with nothing more than an over-sized pocket knife. Another girl is obsessed with cutting out the vines from her body, making a horribly bloody mess of herself. Being in the deep jungle these civilized people slowly turn into barbaric savages who will do anything to stay alive, with little or no hope of rescue. They did tack on a typical Hollywood ending that will allow for a possible sequel. Overall this was a pretty decent movie, the gore effects were top notch, and I've got to say they did a pretty good job with the plants. I mean who isn't afraid of homicidal parasites.

I will of course not spoil it for anybody.Four friends vacationing in Mexico have their trip turn for the worse when they and some friends go to visit and ancient Mayan temple where something evil lurks. I will not give away what that evil exactly is, but once you see the movie you will definitely be feeling queasy afterward when you realize what the horror really is and what it does. The idea is definitely something different and the whole concept of the story is almost original when you compare it to the overload of horror remakes we've been getting for so many years now.The acting in this film is rather competent, and the character's aren't complete idiots like some of them seem to be in the novel. They do a few things that make you wonder, but those scenes are few and far between. I think I counted about two that might've annoyed me a little, but not much else.The evil thing in the movie and novel is also somewhat original, and it does things in the movie, like in the novel, that I didn't think would come across well on the screen. I can't really explain what those things are without spoiling it for those who haven't read the novel or seen the movie yet. All I can say is that what it does actually works well on screen as it did in the novel. I'll say no more.The Ruins is one of the better horror movies to come out this year. The characters are developed to a point, and the gore is there for all the gore lovers. It's not the perfect horror movie like an Alien or Jaws, but is there any such thing anymore. Some of the weaknesses of the film would be that the director relies more on the gag factor without really delivering any suspense or build up.

There is violence and gore but none of it is pointless or senseless or there just for titillating the sicker viewers. It always has a reason.

It's a tightly constructed super-creepy thriller that everyone should watch!! It should easily be ranked at at least 7 - 7.5 so I'm giving it 9 to make up for the ridiculously low ratings it's been getting. :) Every little bit helps.",The Ruins
116,Horrorible_Horror_Films,This movie does not make any sense! VERY Stupid!,1,11 April 2008,"So, in this movie, (which COULD have been a lot better written and hence a very interesting movie but instead sucks) sets up like this: 4 douchebag whitebread college students go to Mexico. They go visit some Mayan ruins that are all covered with vines. Because they touched the vines that are all over the ruins, the crazy locals will not let them leave and force them to stay at the top of the ruin. The locals fear the vines so much they shoot dead one of their own children when one of the college kids throws a vine at him.They have ample means to make fire when trapped on top of the ruins, and they do make fires to stay warm. Also, they know how much the locals, who are their captors, fear the vines. So its pretty simple, if you are not a stupid moron, or writer of a really, really stupid movie, you take the vines and THROW THEM AT YOUR ALL OF YOUR CAPTORS JUST LIKE YOU DID WITH THE KID! You DO NOT sit around slowly dying of thirst and breaking your bones after trying to go down into the ruin! Also, you light the vines that cover the entire ruin on fire! Then you escape! That would have worked as a MUCH better distraction rather than what they did in this movie, and everyone would have had a much better chance to survive. OR what about the other freakin side of the ruin? They only were guarding only one side! And during the entire movie we ONLY see one side of the ruin! The movie does not explain simple logical things like this. You do NOT do all the stupid stuff they do in this stupid movie! What the hell was that? I have not read the book and I hope its better than this, but whoever wrote this movie is an idiot. And all you people that liked this movie are idiots, you probably like Titanic and Shia Labouf movies too.",The Ruins
117,kevin_crighton,A pretty good horror movie,8,20 June 2008,"Four American tourists agree to a trip into a South American jungle with a German tourist, to look at an ancient Aztec temple. Once they get there, they find themselves trapped on the temple by some locals. However, they begin to realize however, that they are keeping them there for a horrifying reason....On the surface, this is yet another movie about American tourists getting into trouble in another country. However, unlike for example Paradise Lost, the Hostel movies, Wolf Creek, and such, the threat here is not from a human source, but something else. It's a refreshing change, but that is only one of the plus points in this good horror movie. There are many more.The script, written by Scott B. Smith based on his own novel, is pretty good. The characters are well written, and the plot as it unfolds takes it's time to play out, which again is refreshing. Most American horror movies seem to want to rush through the opening scenes, to get to the so-called scare moments, but Smith takes time with his plot, as he did with his other script, the brilliant A Simple Plan. This movie isn't as good as that but it is still good. One of the key things is he never explains how or why the temple is doing what it is doing, yet you never really question it. He allows some intelligence in not only the characters but also in the audience watching. Again, a refreshing change.The performances from the cast are good. The script allows time for the cast to make their characters believable (for a horror movie)and as the horror and terror mounts, they react in different ways.The direction by Carter Smith is good. He creates a sense of dread as the the events play out. While the movie is not particularly scary, he creates a sense a good sense of dread, right up to the end, and also doesn't try and cop-out at the end, or allow for some awful twist. Again a welcome change.The movie does have some scenes that are bloody, or graphic and gory, it's not over the top. There is a reason for the violence in the movie, and also the blood and gore. It's not simply there to gross-out the audience (though the scene with the makeshift amputation will have that effect, no doubt!!).At a time when most of the American horror movies are either remakes or sequels, it's nice to see a horror movie that while not original at least is different. And for that reason alone, it's worth watching.",The Ruins
118,sitenoise,The girls give good performances but the film ends up flat.,5,21 June 2008,"And now for something completely different. An angry temple that eats people; no over-sized half-wit with a chainsaw in this one. Instead we have blood thirsty shrubs with the ability to reproduce sounds they hear like cell phones and screaming. They literally get under your skin and when you die they drag you away. If you scream they mock you.There wasn't much particularly scary in this film, but there were a handful of squirm in your seat moments. I like the trend in recent horror movies to keep the gore less gratuitous and more necessary to the plot. Quality over quantity. Give the the special effects department some props.J Tucker was a little miscast, I think, but the two girls were pretty good. A couple other bearded guys played meat puppets. They all suffer while we look on. It seemed a little odd that the group of kids would witness the vines kill and drag one of them away, and then the rest of them just go to sleep in a tent and get up the next morning ready for some more worries. Aside from that ....",The Ruins
119,Dragoneyed363,A really cool and underrated horror film,8,17 July 2008,"The Ruins was an impressive achievement and all out great gory fun, in my honest opinion. While the characters aren't really likable, the movie itself is so entertaining and interesting that it makes up for the obvious solid plot and professional development it lacks. While it's certainly not a masterpiece, The Ruins is just an instantaneous breath of fresh air. It's clever in a sense, creepy to the bone and new with an insane entertainment level that it keeps your attention and doesn't let go.I found the ""creatures"" an effective and nice, sinister twist to deal with next to the other conflict of being stranded upon the Mayan ruins away from all civilization except the natives who are hellbent on letting them die up there, and I thought while the characters were stupid, that was the right way to handle the situation considering that most people would lose their wit in situations like that after some time, and I always like it when horrors try to make their characters believable, because that makes up for them not being special. It was so compellingly good just to watch what all happened, and I really enjoyed the scenes and thought that it had excellent suspense and a wonderful atmosphere of claustrophobia and paranoia.Yes, it gets a little bland around the edges, and like I said, it's not like it ranks among the greatest films of all time, but I truly do think it is a satisfying taste of what effective, legendary horrors could do if they were made with better care, because it has all the right substances, but just falls flat a little with it's slight mediocrity. Regardless, it is nonetheless very amusing and indulging. I praise the creators for coming as far as they did with a poor direction, and for toppling over a lot of horrors that have been made in the past decade. Too bad more people didn't see what I did, because it is quite underrated and under appreciated, I think.",The Ruins
120,joestank15,"Mediocre, though not without a few decent ideas.",5,17 December 2008,"The Ruins - A bunch of young sexy teens are vacationing in Mexico and decide to go to an ""unmapped"" (i.e. death sentence) archaeological dig. Stranded with not a single working cell phone and quarantined by some angry gun toting locals, the group finds that the ruins are not to be trifled with. I'll be honest. I wasn't expecting great art. But I was hoping for something a little more psychologically traumatic than plants. I mean, really? Plants? Looks like The Happening won't be my ticket either once it arrives on Netflix. I get the whole ""man vs. nature"" idea, but to rip the silliest part of ""Jumanji"" out as the star attraction for a horror movie is kinda, well, dumb. Bottom line, it wasn't very scary. There are a couple of cool ideas involving said plants thrown in to be fair. The rare fans of non scary horror have got a film they might like. Steven King liked it, but he is getting on in years and doesn't seem to be trying too hard with his books anymore either. Moving on...That's not to say ""The Ruins"" isn't gory. Yes, oh yes it is. There is lots of exploratory surgery and a hideous scene giving you the ""How Not To""s of moving someone with a broken back. It's disturbing, not scary. And I think the two terms and emotions are being confused for each other a lot these days. It is feasible to have one without the other.What I did like about the film was the character of Jeff (Jonathan Tucker). He actually reminds me a bit of a young Christian Bale. Even though he is the one who puts his friends in this hideous situation, he completely mans up to it and does his best to help the rest survive. We automatically support the stronger characters in horror films because it's how we hope we would act in that given situation. Ironically it's the scared characters, how so many of us actually would act, that we wish will just get on with dying so we don't hear the incessant sobbing and screaming. And I liked Jeff, but couldn't have cared less about the other three kids. There's the jerk (played by Shawn Ashmore of the X-Men films), the stupid slutty one and the ditsy pretty one. I'm not even going to bother with the names. It doesn't matter in these movies unless you actually give a damn about the people. For the most part, I didn't, and the film just wasn't scary.

Sometimes this can be a good thing, but, in this case, it wasn't.Basically, if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the whole movie. There's nothing more to it. Honestly. A monotonous piece of crap that goes on forever, but leads nowhere.The idea is kind of intriguing, but the script - inexcusably poor. There's zero character development, nothing that peaks your interest, and nothing at all scary or suspenseful. And did I mention how boring and predictable the whole thing is? Well, - very.You keep waiting for something (more or less) interesting/scary to happen, but it never does.They're trying to compensate for the painfully obvious lack of decent writing by throwing in a lot of unnecessary gore and a couple of cheap and predictable ""thrills"" (ex. someone's leg's amputated and plants making mobile phone noises). It's just annoying.They've cast a bunch on no-names, because no self-respecting actor would agree to participate in this disaster. The best acting came from the village people, whose screen time is about 2 minutes. The lead characters were well below par. It's neither a thriller, nor a horror movie. You can't really tell what it is, but it's not very good. Potentially, they could've made this movie so much better, but they chose to ruin it instead.",The Ruins

It gives you very little reason to care despite the interesting plot.

124,quinnox-1,"Hilariously bad, had me laughing",4,19 May 2009,"This is one of those horror movies that it is so bad but really funny at the same time. Here are a few choice scenes that had me chuckling: The German dude is lowered into the pit and the rope breaks so he drops down to the ground in the pit and breaks his back, so they send the blonde girl to rescue him, after they lower her down and she is around 10-15 feet from the floor, the rope runs out of cord. Then all of her fellow travelers start shouting ""Jump!"" as if it is no big deal and she goes ahead and plunges down and almost breaks her leg in the process. It was so absurd but funny.Then later on they send the other girl down there and send a makeshift stretcher for the injured guy but this time the rope is long enough to come within 3 feet of the ground!? I love it.So this guys back is broken and the girls try to be smart about it and talk it over about how they are going to pick him up and put him on the board/stretcher, so then after that they pick him up and just about bend him in half and he screams in pain and one of the girls in exasperation says ""Just get him on the board!"" LOL And the Indians are funny too with this big old fat guy tribe leader waving them up the temple ruins as if to say, you better get up there otherwise there won't be a movie!, and then the whole tribe comes to have a camp out.And the leader of this group of idiots is studying to be a doctor, but is about as dumb as a box of rocks and is like the last guy you would want to depend on to lead you out of trouble. And I won't even get started how the blonde girl after seeing a guy get shot in the head is crying and traumatized, but later on at night seems to get horny with her boyfriend, which in the circumstances is ludicrous.This is a good movie to put on for laughs, but don't expect real horror or suspense.",The Ruins
125,Sci-FiHorrorFan,I think This Film is underrated,7,20 November 2012,"I quite liked this film i thought it was quite entertaining and interesting and i liked the idea of having killer plants in the movie that move and infect and kill a person i thought it was a pretty cool idea! so i don't understand why so many people moan and complain about this film and say it sucks i really don't understand that because i thought this was a pretty solid film! and i liked the people that were in it especially Shawn Ashmore i think that guy is a great actor and he played his part well.now i will admit i found the blonde girl in the film a little annoying at times but even she did a good Job with her acting. I thought they all did and i think Shawn did the best Job out of the lot And i'd say the only thing that bugged me about this film were the crazy people at the ruins that wouldn't let the main characters leave because they thought they were infected by the killer plants when they were not and they couldn't have been because they had only just arrived at the ruins and the killer plants were at the top not at the bottom where they were standing! so they obviously were not infected, but the men obviously just couldn't take the risk and let them go which i guess is understandable because they probably didn't know they had just arrived so for all they knew they could have been there longer.So the situation with the men at the ruins is probably the only thing i didn't like in the film but the rest of the film was good and i liked the idea of all the teenagers being trapped up in the ruins and looking for a way to escape it made the film intense and i thought the killer plants were pretty creepy especially when they made those weird noises.I thought this film was pretty decent and i thought the acting was good from the whole cast and i'd say this film deserves a little more praise and less stupid remarks from people. At the end of the day this film is what it is and people should just enjoy it for what it is a Horror survival story,this wasn't supposed to be a big film and no one ever said it was going to be a master piece! which it isn't but i like this film for what it is and i liked the story and i thought it was a pretty Damn scary situation those collage people were in! so if i were them i'd be scared too! so i don't blame them!.

It surprised me and sucked that the Jeff character(Jonathan Tucker) was killed.It surprised me that the writer would do that after enduring so much to stay alive.I hope an alternative ending was filmed for the DVD! He was my favorite character in the film and felt he really carried the film.I think since he died in it,then they all should have died! Or at least had 2 survivors instead of the ""typical"" female character always surviving at the end. The movie had a somewhat believable plot with a fair share of gore and some interesting and tense moments in that remote jungle.The ending implied a sequel may be in the works.If so I hope the same people who made this one do it also.

But it had a clean, slow-paced directing style that reminded me of some of the great 70's slow-burn horrors or perhaps of Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"". Unfortunately, by the time the actual horror gets going, the characters have all either said, or done, something so irrationally stupid or annoying that you find yourself not really caring about any of them anymore.

Two Mayan kids just watch the travelers walk into their death path without saying a single word, is this deliberate to demonize the Mayans?

132,mrush,Run of the mill stuff,5,19 July 2008,"This is another horror film where the trailers and the DVD box looked way better than the movie itself actually was.This was watchable but that is about all.Nothing new or interesting was accomplished here.Five people on vacation decide to leave the beach and visit some ancient Mayan ruins that they have heard about from a newly acquired friend.They set out through the jungle and find a pyramid covered with vine and soon after finding this pyramid the five are surrounded by some native people who make it very clear that the five visitors can not leave the ruins.The five are driven to the top of the pyramid and soon find out what evil lurks there.I guess the hook or catch to this film is that the evil comes from an unexpected source.This film has some graphic gore,pretty cool stuff,but there just isn't enough of it to really impact you.The film is slow to get started and once it does the payoff isn't all that terrific either.Early in the film there is a quick scene of some pretty amazing breasts but other than that there isn't any more nudity.I can't discuss too much of the film without breaking my vow never to use a spoiler alert but suffice to say there are a whole lot of questions about events in the film that just didn't make sense.If this place was so dangerous why were the visitors just allowed to stroll up to it? Put a freaking fence around the thing instead of waiting for people to find it and then having to contain them.And would the evil have been that hard to kill?Who knows,nobody tried. It boils down to maybe a badly written screenplay or a weak premise or both.Like so many horror films today this one left me sort of wishing I had rented something else.Once again a cool looking trailer got me to the rental store and then a neato looking DVD box hooked me into renting another mundane 90 minute horror movie.I keep promising myself I won't let a DVD box hook me but then I'll have a weak moment and pull something like this off the shelf before I can help myself.During the closing credits I saw that Ben Stiller was one of the producers.I wish I had knew that before I rented it and then I would have known that this thing,like Ben,wasn't anything special.Maybe worth a 2 buck rental but certainly there is no reason to buy this thing.",The Ruins

Then I rented ""The Ruins"". It started out as the usual plot line, moronic Americans trying to buy their way through foreign countries to roam and pillage as they like. Soon things go wrong and people start dying. From obvious directing mistakes in the first 15 minutes of the movie, to lame acting to hysterical special effects, this falls into the pit of another bad horror flick. There's one point in the movie when the characters think they hear a cell phone. So, of course, being smart horror movie characters, they go deeper into the ruins that have killed everyone else so far. Soon they find that in fact there is no cell phone and the vines are ""singing"" the cell phone tune. I started laughing, expecting the vines to break out into a chorus of ""It's a Small World"".

135,jamhorner,A Pretty Good Horror Movie,9,20 April 2008,"I will be honest and state that when I went into go see this movie, I had low expectations and I prepared myself to walk out of the theater in utter disgust, but surprisingly that wasn't the case. It was probably one of the best movies of the 'killer plants' subgenre that I have ever seen. This movie has some pretty intense horror scenes as well as primitive surgery; it has some top-notch acting and a very out of the ordinary plot line to drive it. This movie is based off of the novel written by Scott B. Smith and tells of the story of a group of college kids who travel, with their newly found friend, to an ancient pyramid on an archaeological dig. The problem is, the natives trap them on top of it while an ancient evil lurks within it. So the kids are screwed either way but nonetheless a good movie.To begin, this movie had a great amount of gore and horror to it, which I did not expect to any stretch of the imagination. The gore in this movie should mostly be attributed to the primitive surgeries that the kids had to resort to in order to rid themselves of the deadly plant worms. In one scene, they had to break, cut off and cauterize a character's legs. There are many scenes that involved skin removal and vines growing into people's body. I honestly did not expect any of this to be in the movie. As for the horror, you'd think that flowers that can imitate a cell phone ring would be campy, but they manage to scare you by tricking you into believing it would be funny scene. I think that most of the actual 'jump out scares' are within the temple and involve the creeping vines but as far as that, the only thing that is scary is the repulsive the med-school surgery.The acting in the movie was outstanding and seemed as though it was natural dialogue. I think that the two most notable and, for me, the most memorable is the performance by Jonathan Tucker (Hostage & The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and Laura Ramsey (The Covenant). Their performances were so incredibly realistic it's almost as though someone was actually there with a camera recording this tragedy. Other great supporting roles came from Jena Malone, Shawn Ashmore, Joe Anderson and Dimitri Baveas. Again, a notable scene that shows the great performances is the pre to post-surgery scenes and the scenes when the characters become very paranoid.What I actually found interesting was the subtle elements within the story. So in essence I'm talking about the book rather than the movie. There have been many movies that have revolved around killer plants (Creepshow 2, The Double Garden and The Land Unknown). However, what they all have in common is that the plants are just plants and they are not intelligent. The one horror/musical that comes to mind that has a smart plant is ""Little Shop of Horrors."" The plants in this movie have flows, that if they vibrate in a certain way their pedals and ovary resemble a sound close to a cell phone ring or whispering. It sounds cheesy and stupid, but it's not. The story focus a lot on the plants, but it also focuses on the paranoia that the kids have as well as their sanity break down. This is effective because then the whole movie does not rely on the plants as their main ""scare factor."" Overall, I think this movie is going to be one of those films that will be overlooked as just another stupid plant-dumb-teenager-vacationers horror movie when it's not. It's a clever and witty blend of ""Turistas"" and man eating plants. There are outstanding performances by the actors and actresses, some gritty and gory surgery scenes, great scares and some very interesting story elements. I think that any horror fan should watch this film especially those who love jungle themed or surgery theme horror movie. This is a teenage oriented horror movie so if you like teen slashers or teenage-vacation-gone-wrong movies, you'll love this movie. As for me, I thought it was one of the best executed adapted story from a horror novel.",The Ruins
136,robertallenandersonjr,A very entertaining horror movie,9,9 April 2008,"The ruins was a very unique and original movie. It was very different than most movies you will see. Some of the reasons it was different were because the plants were the things who were killing the people. This movie also had me kicking the seat in front of me because I was getting so frustrated with the characters. The only actor that I really liked a lot was Jonathan Tucker who played Jeff. I loved what he kept doing for his girlfriend. He trusted her and did anything for her. His girlfriend Jena Malon who was played by Amy on the other hand was a little bit annoying and needed some work. Laura Ramsey who was played by Stacey was Erics girlfriend who was played by Shawn Ashmore did very good jobs acting as well. Stacey became a little bit crazy toward the end. This movie really makes you think what you would do if you were one of the four up there. I really liked some of the visuals of the place they were staying at. The place the movie took place at was Australlia. This had some very great gore scenes as well. I honestly haven't seen some of the gore they showed in this movie. It was way more gore than I thought. Their was some nudity which they didn't need. They always throw it in the horror movies anyways. Overall this was a very well made creepy horror flick. There were many different scenes that will make you jump. In my theatre the first time I saw it I jumped a couple times. The second time I saw it there were more people in the theatre and I knew what was coming but everyone else jumped and screamed. I saw this Friday afternoon and it had like 5 other people in the theatre besides me. I was hoping that this movie was going to do really well but it didn't. There were more people in the theatre on Monday when I saw it for my second time. I think that half the reason it didn't do as well as they hoped was because all of the young teens wanted to see this and they can't since it's rated R.

137,Lando_Hass,Pretty cool.....I guess.....,7,3 April 2008,"I just screened The Ruins and didn't think much of it beforehand. I thought it looked cool, but didn't really expect anything bad or good. All in all, it was better than most movies of it's kind, and could've easily been worse, but could've been just a little bit better too.Of course, it's about a group of young people that, by chance, find their way into the old ruins of some old Mayan pyramid thing. When they get there, they're ambushed by the (Mayan?) locals, and pretty much held at the pyramid/ruins against their will. The locals won't let them leave, and stakeout the outside of the ruins with guns and arrows and all that cool stuff. So, really, what's one to do in such a freaky, crazy situation? There's not much to do other than survive, which is what these people struggle to do throughout the movie. Not only do they have to worry about surviving from hunger or dehydration (five people have only ONE bottle of water to ration, plus a a tiny bit of food), but they also have to worry about not only the crazy ass killer vines/foliage that inhabit these ruins, but they also have to worry about staying sane.Everything that can go wrong pretty much does. The worst things happen to these people. Really. I was watching and every few minutes, I just said, ""Wow, that's a bitch. That sucks."" Not only do they have to worry about freaky killer vines, they also have to worry about themselves, because one of them starts to go insane and one of them is seriously injured.I know what you're thinking. The whole notion of killer plants/vines sounds completely stupid. I thought so, too. How was this going to be scary or even kind of freaky? Personally, I thought they handled it pretty damn well. What could've ended up being ridiculous and stupid ended up being kind of freaky. It's not really the vines/plants themselves that are scary, it's just the idea of what they are and what they do to these people that's kind of scary. The scenes inside the pyramid, where it's just wall to wall of this scary crap, was a little creepy because they were everywhere and it was overwhelming and claustrophobic at the same time. The scenes inside the actual pyramid are scary because it's so dark and it's such a confined space that these vines actually were kind of freaky because they were pretty much wall-to-wall. It was an abyss filled with these plants, that mimicked the noises around them, making them that much more creepy.Of course, the movie's filled with blood. Lots of it. The violence is great because most of it didn't come from the vines like you'd expect; most of the crazy crap was a result of the characters; the presence of the vines just made things worse and nastier. None of the gore is there to really shock you, it's just there, it just makes you cringe instead of yell in excitement, like most movies of it's kind. There's a really nasty scene involving a guy, legs, a hunting knife, a rock, and a hot pan...and it's nasty....The only thing I was missing from the movie was that it didn't really pack much of a punch. It was just there, there wasn't that much to it. A lot of what happens is sad and effective, especially how a lot of these characters get screwed over, but I would've preferred if there was just more to it. I thought it would've been better if the movie was just an all-out downer, even though nothing really positive ever happens. The characters act like you'd expect, too. They go through every decision rationally and logically, and opt not to do things that they know will get them killed. They react just as you'd expect someone to react in a situation like this.It's a cool movie because it doesn't take the easy way out like most horror movies do. Bad things happen to characters that you like, even though you kind of hate to see it, because all these characters are pretty likable and interesting. I thought the ending could've packed more punch, because it ended up being too bland for my taste, but that's just me. Even though some unexpected stuff happens, it still could've used some more punch. But eh. Who cares?This was a pretty cool movie. Could've been a little better, but could've ended up a lot worse, too. Pretty damn entertaining, and some pretty crazy violence. Score: 8",The Ruins
138,brettchatz-1,A horror film that grips you and rips you apart,6,2 May 2008,"Here's a flick that'll have you trembling in your boots. It's riveting entertainment right through until the very end.A group of American tourists decide to take an adventure trip in Mexico in search of some ancient ruins.What they find is a little more than they bargained for. A voracious and demonic vegetation  vines to be precise  has it in for them.It's not long before an angry mob of zealots attack the tourists, forcing them onto the sacrificial alter that is the pyramid.The acting is below par; the script is lame and the effects are low budget. What the film does offer is a way of entertaining that's good until the end.The story  while flawed in every way  is captivating.Kudos to a low-budget horror crew for an exciting little bloody romp!",The Ruins
139,rlange-3,Creepy!,7,25 July 2008,"Heh, OK, pun intended. Still this was a remarkably good movie and far exceeded my expectations overall. I mean how likely is it that a plant is going to succeed as the monster in a movie? Even Body Snatchers had human help, and Little Shop was mostly tongue in cheek. This one was human vs plant and managed to be both eerie and exciting at the same time. You've got to give it points for making the most out of a rather long shot.It's got slightly more gore than I usually like but enough to keep fans of gore entertained, and too much screaming by the women but there's pretty good reason behind it. There are parts of the plot that are contrived but not very. (The idea that only the guys could operate the hoist is off, and you might have thought they would be smart enough to check the rope before sending someone down the first time but these are hardly egregious.) Acting is decent, the screenplay is well done, it develops and proceeds at a good pace after a somewhat longish introduction, and leaves you with a feeling that really is rather... creepy. No pun intended this time.",The Ruins

This is the framework that so many movies turn around that it by now can be called a Genre. Only rarely do we see this kind of movie with more mature characters - like in the legendary ""Deliverance"" starring Jon Voigt and Burt Reynolds. Maybe we are more easily scared when it is younger people who are being victimized. Or else it's a matter of the simple fact that these movies targets young people who more often goes to the cinema so that they can identify with the protagonists. Either way it's always interesting why a specific theme appears and is being repeated almost endlessly in different movies. I think that these movies stirs some hidden fear in us and that's why they are produced en mass.""The Ruins"" has some good scares but a story that is seriously under-developed. The worst part being, that none of our young protagonists tries to verbalize what is happening. Didn't they feel a need to communicate to each other what was going on and to try and form a theory that could explain it? Well, we knew that they would eventually die and the thrill is nothing but how this would happen and in which order. We really didn't hope they would make it out alive and I could go so far as to claim that we would have felt cheated if they did.If you want a mainstream movie with serious gore, a very predictable story, that is easily digested then this might work for you.Regards SimonPs.

When Lisa asks ""Dad, how did you do that"" he scoffed and replied ""its a plant!"" The story of ""The Ruins"" works if you believe that plants can move with great speed, mimic the sounds around them (such as conversation, screams, cell phone ring tones, etc...) quite literally minutes after they can be heard, and you reject that whole well established scientific idea of photosynthesis and roots and all. In other words, its about as practical as you or I having coffee and a bagel on Saturn's outer ring next Friday afternoon! To summarize the story in approximately 60 words: 4 American students in Mexico for a spring break head off to ruins with a German they just met; when they get to the ruins they encounter some locals who force them to stay on the ruins until they're all dead. The plants can 'talk,' move with great speed, and eat them while they're alive, but preferably while they're dead.Lots of gore, but it becomes lame the more you think about it, and I couldn't help but chuckle afterwords.

""we are 4 Americans stranded on a holiday, the world just simply can not forget about us"" ; or how the locals are portrayed as willing to shoot their own people but NOT the American ""citizens""; or how the four main characters are the typical spoiled brats, like every American teenager is a ""paris Hilton"" or wanting to be(!?);or how the 4 friends are interacting with each-other. Awful and quiet irritating at times; if an average Mexican citizen will watch this feature he/she might have a smile or two, unlike someone north of the border living in a state of paranoid fear, and that even is the movie tries to twist that as being the other way around... it is quiet sad to see gross cultural ignorance displayed here but not forgetting the sex clichés; yuck.

From the writer of ""A Simple Plan"" complete with a good looking cast who have enough talent that they are more than just faces(and bodies). Some neat aspects to the horror part. Nothing that has been done too much and not a typical horror theme. But when you get near the end and the climax happens. You know, where Sigourney Weaver is running through the self destructing space ship, or Jamie Lee Curtis character is in a mad dash to escape Michael Myers, or where Naomi Watts is down that strange well and the body appears there? That doesn't happen here. There is no heart in the mouth chase from unspeakable horror. The show doesn't actually have a climax. It's like they ran out of money or accidentally cut it out. I could think of a number of ways the inside of a labyrinth like pyramid might be used to give a film an exciting climactic finish. Apparently the director couldn't.

148,MWNiese,Unimpressive Regurgitated Plot,5,14 March 2009,"FIVE OUT OF TEN STARS While the ""Ruins"" is a fairly well polished production, it suffers terribly from it's tired storyline. I mean really, the film never really seems to hit a peak. I was left wondering: What was the climax? Honestly though, the acting was decent and the directing was adequate.... It was a technically sound production. I should also credit this production for shooting this film on location in Australia. The cinematography is quite beautiful, and stunning at times. The problem is, is that I didn't rent this movie from Netflix to see exotic locales, I rented it to be scared. The problem is the story: A group of beautiful, educated, young, white, yuppies on vacation in Mexico decide right before they are ready to return to the States, that they should visit an ancient and mysterious pyramid that is legend ed to be cursed. How original! I seriously laughed at the reviews that praised this movie for being, ""So original"". Are you kidding me? Did I mention the pyramid isn't on any maps and located dangerously close to nowhere. This is supposed to be new and fresh?Once these cookie cut-out white people reach the haunted ruins, they are confronted by an angry local tribe, that force them to take refuge atop the haunted ruins. How quaint! The tribal group is never explained or utilized to enrich the story; aside from acting like animals and blubbering in gibberish about something we're never clued into about. Thanks production staff! So with the tribe keeping the pretty white kids stuck on top of the ruins, which is never explained, we're led down an unimpressive road to nowhere. Really, this movie goes nowhere: The white brats get stuck on top of the ruins, the naked locals stand at the bottom and drool, and the brats are forced to fight blood sucking vines. That's it! I mean, you call that a movie? The scariest aspect of the film, inside the pyramid, is never utilized; and we are left having to chew on a half baked story that's been retold in previous films one hundred times. Oh boy, and wait to the acidic plants start dissolving the bratty spoiled med students. Please, I could have cared less for the death of these yuppie scum balls. The movie had potential, believe me; as I said, it was a fairly well polished production. But you have to take my word for it: The idea that we're supposed to be scared by killer plants on top of ancient ruins in glaring sunlight, and root for rich white kids in medical school? Hold on, I need to throw up!""The Ruins"" is another case in point of how desperate the American horror industry is for new ideas. Unfortunately, it's not that there aren't new ideas, it's just that the movie studios are afraid to finance the new ideas out there that are being developed by budding and talented filmmakers. So the bottom line? ""The Ruins"" has some quality production values but ultimately goes nowhere with a recycled bore of a screenplay.",The Ruins
149,jackbanister16,Attack of the killer plants...?,5,11 January 2014,"***Judging based on the film, never actually read the book*** I saw this movie in theaters back in 2008 and remember being disappointed, but watched it again a couple days ago on ""SyFy,"" so my review comes after a fresh viewing. This film gets three stars for a relatively strong opening act and two more for good cinematography and SFX. The beginning and buildup to the actual ""Ruins"" were pretty awesome! I enjoyed the actors well enough and thought that the foreboding nature of the story was set up well. I was actually fascinated with the film up until the plants came in. I now realize that this movie was based on a best selling novel, but it just did NOT translate that well onto celluloid. I never read the book though so I don't know how accurate or ""true"" the film was to the original story. I'm glad I didn't read it though because it probably would have made the film seem even worse.Like I said before, the film had my full attention up until the plants came in, then it just got bad...The brutal natives which killed Dimitri and one of their own children were VERY scary and I thought they were very effective. If the movie had been centered around a conflict between our heroes and them, it would have been MUCH better film. Instead they are thrust to the side for the mystical and murderous plants that cover the ruins. There was just something cheesy about the killer plants...When the character Mathias was losing his legs and you see what looks like hemp plants covering his legs all I could do was laugh hysterically. SO DUMB. I didn't know if the main characters should amputate his legs or roll them up in a blunt and smoke them! HA! The killer poison oak goes on to claim a few more lives before the two other mains, Jeff and Amy, decide to brave the killer natives in order to escape the ""murderous vines."" Long story short, Jeff sacrifices himself, gets shot down by the natives and Amy manages to escape. Basically, what could have been an enthralling clash of cultures horror film, ends up seeming like a SyFy feature of the week. I don't want it to seem like I'm 100% against killer plants or any other type of supernatural elements in movie plots, I'm not. In this case though, there was very little background or reasoning behind the plants. I'm sure the whole thing was fleshed out in the novel, but in the film it just seems out of place and cheesy.For me, this film boils down to one thing; Wasted potential. Started off strong, but ultimately ended up going in the wrong direction. Someone could make a killer remake of this which would involve the natives more and I would totally watch it. If you need a couple hours to kill and there are nothing else but infomercials on, watch it. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",The Ruins

It had a surprisingly original story, and not a clone of the so many awful horror films that seem to be churned out on a conveyor belt these days! The film is both atmospheric, claustrophobic and creepy (something you can't say for most recent non classic horror tales - i.e. the gross out ""SAW"" series), with great visual effects. One can feel the pain, and the terror our victims are going thru. The Mayan setting too is highly original for a horror film, the lack of communication between the day-trippers and the jungle natives also added terror as you feel their frustration for not knowing why they're being attacked! It did tend to start to drag towards the end, so it's a good thing, they decided to keep it's running time a bearable 90 minutes, with one totally gratuitous female nude scene. I'm sure the director convinced her it was essential to the plot!

This movie was incredibly entertaining (for a horror fan).The main concept is good, and it's all very well executed. The sound guys in particular have done a great job, and the movie has a grainy, distinctive look. I love it how the film manages to remain interesting to the very end, in such a small setting, and with such a little cast. I thought this was better than the overrated ""The Descent"". By the way, do whatever you can to watch the ""Unrated"" version of this film.Some things could have been better developed, like the relationship between the two main characters and the actors' sometime 'unrealistic' reactions at the bizarre incidents taking place. But these are not big flaws and in fact the first point I brought up could actually be explained as a smart red herring.There are supernatural undertones here, and while they are not fully-explored, it's enough to make you uncomfortable. There's a lot of gore for those not used to it, but it serves a purpose. This is at times a 'hallucinogenic' movie, and about a thousand times better than ""Shrooms"" at it.This movie gives me hope that the days of ""torture-porn"", scary Japanese children and über-gore are ending. Make it different, interesting and scary instead - The Ruins fits the bill. Judging by this movie, 2008 seems like a very promising year for the genre.Just one last word: Don't even THINK about using Entheogens after watching this. You know that Salvia extract and the Morning Glory seeds you ordered online? Give them to someone who hasn't seen this.

Correct me if I'm wrong but a pyramid has four sides right, ya I thought so. The ending feels to clever for these same characters to have thought up, where was this when their friends were dieing. With all that said the fact that there stupidity bothered me at least shows that I gave a crap about what was going on to these guys and that is more then I usual in movies of this type.

I was hoping there would be some crazy twist or, at the very least, it would be graphically shocking. And while the amputation scene was pretty intense  it just fell short in the end. I didn't care at all about these kids. In fact, at one point - after hearing Jena Malone's character bitching about everything under the sun one too many times - I said who cares about these people, they're deplorable: get on with the killing already - and start with her!

And I read some material on the website that made it sound like the filmmakers tried hard to create a good adaptation. They did try, but it wasn't enough.Finally watching the movie was an odd experience, because my hopes for it and my memory of the book kind of got tangled up with what I was actually watching. After giving it some thought, though, I have to say I'm a little disappointed.The story concerns a group of tourists in Mexico who decide to check out some ruins. Horror ensues. The cinematography is good, the visual effects are smartly deployed, the score is effective, the acting is good. I think the problem lies in the script and the direction. The opening scenes that serve to introduce the characters are rushed. The whole movie feels like ""this happened, and then this happened"", allowing no room for us to care much about the characters. And that is deadly for a story in which bad things happen to everyone.

160,mbworm,Book Fans Will Be Pleased; Horror Fans will Be Thrilled,9,2 May 2008,"For some reason I can't see that people who have read the novel by Scott Smith will enjoy this adaptation as much as those who have not, but nonetheless all will find this horror thriller extremely satisfying, especially gore lovers.Amy, Jeff, Stacy and Eric (Jena Malone, Jonathan Tucker, Laura Ramsey, and Shawn Ashmore) are on vacation in Mexico, relaxing and drinking by the beach and poolside before they all go their separate ways to college. When they meet a German named Mathias who needs to visit a site of ancient ruins in the jungle to find his missing brother, the vacationers, although reluctant, decide to tag along and have some fun on their last day. Boy did they have the wrong idea.Soon after they find the foreboding hidden path deep in the jungle, they stumble upon an abandoned archaeological dig amidst an ancient pyramid covered in vegetation. The local Mayans show up and after they shoot one of the other tagalongs and force the group up the trail, keeping guard around the pyramid, it becomes clear that the vacationers are being held hostage. Fear, hunger, and insanity begin to set in as over a three day period the group's mentalities begin to diminish. One by one, they fall prey to the evil vines that reside on the ancient ruins and it slowly becomes clear that they're probably not going to make it out of Mexico alive. Does this sound stupid? Sure. Killer vines, that's laughable. But during their stay you slowly begin to realize this isn't funny at all. It's hardcore chilling, and the vines are nothing to laugh at. They're used to a terrifying effect, especially in a chilling scene when Amy and Stacey descend into the pyramid and the vines try to kill them.As far as quality, the acting is top notch, especially from Jena Malone and Laura Ramsey. Ramsey's Stacy suffers the worst physical harm and her performance is the best as she clearly goes insane when some nasty vines nestle in under her skin. All of the actors are exceptional and the audience will feel very attached. It's especially hard to watch when they start dying. These are real people in a horrifying situation. This isn't a mild horror film, it pulls no punches. It's straightforward, and although it is about killer flowers, it's as good as a horror movie can get, and the tension that director Carter Smith builds through the great pacing is unbearable. Kudos also goes to Jena Malone, who has broken free of her childhood performances and is getting into much more mature work. She is promising here.I won't spoil the outcome of the character's fates but I will say for fans of the novel that the story is twisted around somewhat. Scott Smith adapted this from his book. The same events basically happen, but he's switched up his characters and the end starts to stray further and further from his novel. That's not to say that it doesn't work, for I think that it makes the experience better, you can go in expecting some new scares even if you've read the harrowing novel. I was supremely pleased at this take on the horrifying story and I was surprised to find myself shaken when it was over, particularly during the grueling scene when Stacy cuts into herself repeatedly with a hunting knife to pull out vines. This is one of the most unsettling scenes depicted in a horror film recently. You won't forget ""The Ruins"" and it's one of the best horror movies in a long time.",The Ruins

I got a bit more than I bargained for. I shared the confusion of the characters in the beginning, and as they figured out what was going on and why, so did I. Given the limited plot and the situation that the entire cast is at the same place during the entire movie during their predicament, they probably made the best out of it. It takes a while for the cast and the viewer to realize where the real danger comes from, and i liked that. Also it comes from an unexpected angle. The CGI is kept to a very minimum, unlike the remake of 'the thing', which, although entertaining, almost made me want to turn it off after seeing the first CGI...I liked this movie better.I would recommended it for fans of the genre.",The Ruins
164,Celluloid_Fiend,"Entertaining Horror Is What Is Ultimately ""Ruined!""",4,5 February 2019,"I'll admit right upfront, I've never read the book that ""The Ruins"" is based from. So, I can't really comment on how true the movie is to the original story. What I can say, though, is that this movie did nothing to make me want to seek out the book it is based on.I really wanted to like this movie. I've been so hoping for a good rated R horror movie for some time. All these remakes and torture films masking as horror, have really had me thinking maybe no one knows how to make a new and original horror movie anymore. I was praying ""The Ruins"" would change that feeling for me, but it has only intensified it.The film starts off well enough, with a couple of young college couples vacationing in Mexico, when they are given the opportunity to check out some ""off the tour guide"" ruins, before they have to leave. The first 30-40 minutes of the film is pretty solid stuff. You even come to like the characters a little.Once they reach the ruins, though, the movie starts to lose it. It never is explained exactly where these vines came from, or what the deal with them is. We come to see the nearby villagers are trying to keep them from spreading, but we don't know how or why. The whole threat the vines pose really isn't given any kind of explanation, which only leads to unsatisfying questions that don't get answers.There are a few really gory moments in the film, but most of it happens within the last third of the film. And by this point, you really just don't know what to make of anything that you care a whole lot about it. It just feels like gore for the sake of it.The only truly ""jump from your seat"" moment is when the girls first come to learn of the danger the vines represent, otherwise there is little in the way of suspense in the movie. In fact, the vines seem to do less damage to these tourists, than they end up doing to themselves. So they don't seem to pose much of a threat, after all. And when the lone survivor escapes, you are left wondering what this means for the rest of the world, since keeping the vines contained was made into such an important point in the film. And the ending of the film? Total rubbish, which is all I have to say about that.""The Ruins"" starts off like a classic horror film from the late 70's and early 80's, but soon degenerates into little more than a plodding and uninteresting film, that relies on some torturous moments of gore to try to shock you awake again. It almost feel disingenuous to call it a horror film, since the only thing to provide you with horror, is the realization that you aren't going to get the those 91 minutes of your life back. If there was a moral to this movie, I guess it would be to stick to the tourist traps, when you are in a strange country. But I'd impart the additional moral to stick to renting a good horror movie, over viewing this poorly done effort.",The Ruins
165,Sabalon,MUCH different (and better) than expected,7,22 June 2008,"When my wife and I saw the previews for this I remember her saying ""Who would want to see that?"" Based on the previews, it looked like something worth catching if a chance arose, but nothing to go out of the way for. Seemed to be some spooky shot of some Mayan ruins and some strange goings on.The trailer seemed to completely misrepresent this movie. Yes, there are Mayan ruins an strange goings on, but it's not a ""who's lurking in the dark"" movie. In fact, the horror element is pretty minimal. It is very much a look at people trying to survive in what is a pretty bad situation.There are not really any shocks or surprise twists in this...just a very straight-forward story that digs deep into your own mind as what you would do facing the circumstances. A bit gory at times, but not really for any shock value - it fits in perfectly with the story.I would say this reminds me of an Alford Hitchcock meets Alive style movie for lack of a better description.",The Ruins

167,georgebush,Day of the Triffids way better,1,12 April 2008,"This bottom of the barrel film was just about one gross out after another. The great science fiction film Day of the Triffids. This stupid film begins with the Americans making fools of themselves by being loud and low life in a resort in Mexico. It is these kind of loud vulgar types of tourist Americans that so many countries hate like France. So all of the main characters are jerks except the German.Then we get to see about 20 minutes of a graphic double amputation of legs. There are many more graphic scenes and the children in the audience seemed near hysteria. The only good acting came from the German, the bearded fellow and the old villain leader of the Mexican gang. But the best acting belonged to the cab driver who had one line which isn't saying much. This was not even a B movie.",The Ruins
168,piksplanet,gripping..,8,10 September 2008,"The Ruins is a psychological horror/thriller film based on Scott Smith's bestselling novel, and directed by Carter Smith. Scott Smith is best known for his novel A Simple Plan, his screen adaptation of which earned him an Oscar nomination in 1998. He has also written the screenplay for this film. The film stars Jonathan Tucker, Shawn Ashmore, Jena Malone, Laura Ramsey and Joe Anderson.Unlike the new age slasher films that come out of Hollywood in the name of horror/thriller these days, The Ruins differs. It will not disappoint fans and critics of the psychological thriller genre. It does not switch gears to become a slasher film. Like what D.J.Caruso did with Disturbia last year, Carter Smith does even better with The Ruins. Disturbia's shift to a slasher film was a huge let-down by the time the closing credits rolled. The Ruins stands out because of its independent nature. It does not depend on blood and gore to make you feel queasy. It plays with your head, your views. It churns your insides by showing you fear and pain instead of spilled guts and decapitated heads. The sounds, the silent breathtaking visuals, the close-ups; are the elements that make the Ruins work. The tension that it succeeds in creating halfway through the film never backs out. It remains throughout.The Ruins is a simple film, with a simple story. There aren't any digressions in it. It's all given to you straight. Take it, or leave it. The viewers are thrown smack in the middle of the situation. The popular nature of the film becomes evident after the introduction of the main characters themselves. A few 20 something's on vacation. There is nothing new in The Ruins when it comes to setting or characters, it's the technique that makes it stand out. It delves as deep as possible into the human mind as it can within its 93minute running time.Loved it. Love the song in the closing credits (Phenomena by Yeah Yeah Yeahs). 8/10!",The Ruins
169,teekieteekybirdie,"killer plants, that's it. so stupid.",1,15 November 2019,"Don't waste your time watching this garbage, it was a total waste of time. typical whiny annoying 20 something year olds venturing into an uncharted unknown place stupidly, and what happens? they all get eaten alive by talking moving cannibalistic plants! that's it. the whole movie is just about killer plants eating people. that's it. no suspense, nothing scary about this movie, total waste of time, so pathetic and stupid. one of the worst movies i've ever seen. seriously.",The Ruins
170,blackasp98,Yeesh a bad move,1,14 April 2008,"I have to say that this movie was not what i expected. Even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with. With the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. This is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most, but not a crocodile. Either way this film was like that, it entices you to think about ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect. But plants?.... come on, is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd?. As for this movie it will hit the 'b' list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see, but it didn't make up for the rest of the film. And a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed. I am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects. I do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense. The thing had a better story line than this did. Even the ring had me jumping for more, but the ruins is just that..... ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers. The premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder.",The Ruins
171,bloodymonday,Review: The Ruins,6,27 June 2008,"OK, what we have here is the killer vines. Yes I know, it maybe one of the most ridiculous monster you've heard (and that M. Night's killer wind is no different), but the thing is, The Ruins is surprisingly effective. It's like you can't help but laughing at the idea of girl with a machine gun attached to her leg in Planet Terror, but soon you realized that it can literally blow your head off right after you finished laughing.Like the most of your typical horror movie begin, The Ruins presented four reckless, clueless and absolutely simple-minded American students (Jena Malone, Jonathan Tucker, Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey) who are just having a good time in Mexico. They decided to add a little bit of authentic scent in their trip by accompanying a German (Joe Anderson) to find his brother in some ancient ruin. They know that it's going to be one hell of an adventure. But what they don't know that it's also going to be the end of their precious little life when something evil in that ancient ruin started to terrorize them.Even it may sound conventional as it is, The Ruins still able to create any necessary tensions that build around characters. The director (Carter Smith) understand his material enough to know that the idea of vile monster crawling around places will not going to sustain the whole running times. So he gives an opportunity to his actors to do their things along the way (more than just be moaning and whining). In your typical horror movies, they normally create cheap suspense by making us curious about who's going to die next? Or how awesome they're going to die? It's good to know that The Ruins was looking at the different aspect, just like a good horror flick The Descent, they made us wondered that who and how are they going to survive? (if any) From what we've learnt so far, The Ruins neither sound like J-horror turned PG-13 Hollywood remade craps where suspense created by editing tricks or how loud the volume were, nor like torture porn flicks that literally tortured humankind who choose to them (Captivity was probably killed the existent of torture porn heyday). But still, it gives you enough gore for just about your average horror flicks. It gives a little bit of skin crawling (no pun intended) moment of vines lurking uninvited into human being. And it also gives us one of the most stomach-churning amputations ever depicted.But no matter how good on its idea, The Ruins fell short on acting department and their inane dialogs. Especially Jena Malone whose once promising career is now on the crossroad, sad to say she picked a wrong road, because her acting is unwatchable (not to mention irritating). On the other hand, Shawn Ashmore (Iceman of X-Men 2) is unexpectedly good (for this kind of film), but his screen time was cut short when they decided to focus on Jena's character (which I couldn't careless).What happened in the ending is absolutely bollock (and absurd). To me, it's just another Hollywood ending that will probably make you feel really bad right after the end credit rolled. But beside that, The Ruins is like a breeze of fresh air in horror genre. It packed with considerable amount of suspense and horror that will indeed satisfied you more or less.",The Ruins
172,brandon_veracka,Terrible.,4,16 July 2020,"This movie is an unimaginative gore-fest. Everything about it is cliché and it does nothing more than turn your stomach. I watched the entire thing, and I wished I hadn't. Not at any time did I feel entertained or interested in what was going to happened. You can see the entire plot unfold in your mind right after the sixth or seventh scene. This is trash horror. Just because there are some really cute actresses in it doesn't make it any better, nor does one decent idea (it has both). Also, take note that this review is coming from someone who's seen HUNDREDS of horror movies. It may not be a one-star movie, but it's still rubbish.",The Ruins

So much pablum horror has been cranked out by Hollywood lately, any suggestion of intensity is welcome. Four friends vacationing in Mexico take a detour to an ancient site, thanks to a chance encounter. From there things get nasty pretty fast with a few nice shocks. The film follows some standard twists that many horror fans will be familiar with, but it's additions and surprises freshen it up. All of the actors are great at expressing fear and shock. The villain of the piece is pretty unique and was done very well. Some of the scenes are graphic and gory, but have a reason to be there. There are lots of ""I was on vacation and got the thrill of my life"" horror films out there but this one is different and fun.",The Ruins
174,tohkwongweng,Better than average scary movie,7,23 December 2018,This one has been in my collection for awhile and I finally got round to watching it. I remember reading the book by Scott Smith some years ago. Loved the idea of carnivorous vines preying on dead people and for the most part the movie managed to pull off the suspense factor although it wasn't all that scary. Lots of gore though to appreciate. Still it was highly enjoyable to watch even though the ending was a little predictable.,The Ruins
175,kyleallen_9,Cursed,10,17 February 2009,"I was so excited for DreamWorks release The Ruins and I knew that it would be an awesome flick because DreamWorks brought us Disturbia, The Haunting and the upcoming The Uninvited. I was shocked when I watched this movie, because I figured it would be just a creepy curse flick, I had no idea that it would be brutal and gory. Its pretty much about four close college friends Jonathan Tucker(Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Hostage), Jena Malone(Saved and Stepmom), Laura Ramsey(Venom and The Covenant) and Shawn Ashmore(The X-Men Series) and a few others, end up coming across a Mayan ruin site, where a few people vanished. Once they touch the site, a curse begins to unfold and attack the friends, who begin to die one by one. Once the friends become infected by the carnivorous vines, the only way to break the curse, is to die. This movie had some pretty intense and gruesome scenes that I haven't seen before, so i definitely recommend anyone who comes across this flick to watch it, you wont be disappointed. it.",The Ruins
176,em89072002,Interesting concept with a mediocre execution,4,8 April 2008,"THE RUINS is a mediocre suspense flick which has similarities to TURISTAS (2006) and THE DESCENT (2005).The basics are all there: the camera and audio work are competent, the film does have a story line, and there are a few gruesome scenes that would justify categorizing this as a horror flick. So, criticism pertains to the story itself.No subtle foreshadowing here; instead, the characters blatantly say things don't seem right over and over again. And, over and over again things go wrong just as they stated. This type of character narration is unnecessary --- it kills the suspense.The horror aspect is two fold. First there is the mystery of the ruins which is a bit of a supernatural, inexplicable, mild sense of horror. The second aspect is the manner in which the characters respond to the circumstances --- they basically create their own horror: self-mutilation, chopping off limbs, murder.Finally, the female characters in this flick are often portrayed as weak and irrational while the male characters are portrayed as men of ideas and action. These stereotypes are stupid and insulting; and, this makes for a dull film.",The Ruins
177,billpeter,"A good horror film, but may not be what it seems",7,28 November 2008,"This is a good horror film, because it has the following essential elements;1. A preposterous plot (more of which later) 2. Pretty young women, one of whom takes her clothes off 3. Ugly, revolting foreign peasants, just like in Frankenstein 4. Some gore and a painful death 5. The odd scary bitHOWEVER, the plot involves killer bushes that can talk, although not very well.

178,IMDBer100575,Something a Little Different,6,30 October 2010,"I decided to watch this movie after reading its description. I thought it'd be about possession or spirits or at least an ancient tribe. It was, in a way, all of the above.The ambiance of this movie was great. Lighting was well done so there weren't too many scenes that were too dark or too bright. I didn't pay attention to the music but I don't recall anything loud or obnoxious. The acting was as good as any low budget flick can get. All the characters were well played. I did get annoyed at some of the characters for getting over-emotional about their situation, so the actors / actresses did their job.The plot is a new one for me. Like I said, I watched this movie expecting some sort of spirit(s) in the the ruins or a supernatural creature. It was both: something supernatural in the vines. There was sufficient character and plot development to keep your attention. However, I really do feel that the writers got bored at the end and decided to just end the movie. It seemed very abrupt. Maybe they ran out of good weed or possibly even ran out of film? If you're bored, this movie is definitely worth a watch. Don't expect too much and just enjoy it for what it is...a decent movie about vines.",The Ruins
179,erostew,Tries but Misses the Mark,5,29 July 2008,"There are some fairly well-known names in the credits for this flick so I went into it with fairly high expectations. I was disappointed.This film does at least have a semi-original premise. Similar things have been done before but not with evil vines as the villain/monster. At least not that I can remember.And that's kind of the problem with the whole thing. The plants just aren't that scary. Which leaves any chills in this movie to the gory stuff. There were a couple of pretty gross scenes but not enough to balance out the lack of suspense.The other big problem is the writing. The characters are one dimensional and I really didn't care much about any of them. Lines like ""Four Americans do not go missing on vacation"" don't help anything either. The ending is clichéd and it's been done about 1000 times before.The whole premise of the story is kind of weak. They get off the bus and have 11 miles to go in a taxi and 2 miles on foot if I remember correctly. So this ""unknown"" Mayan temple isn't exactly way back in the boonies somewhere. But nobody knows it's there, or that it has an evil plant on it? And what's up with the hand-cranked generator that needs one crank and then they have electric light for the rest of the movie? The screenwriter (who also wrote the book) has one previous credit to his name that wasn't exactly a blockbuster, but was better than this.The director is a fashion photographer. Really. He shot 2 short films before this. And you can tell. Not because the actors look like models (they don't), but because he just doesn't do anything with this script. He lets the actors stumble around in the dark.The cinematographer is well known and quite talented. Unfortunately he doesn't add much to this film. That isn't really his fault, but it's a fact.Cgi is kind of lame. But honestly it's hard to make a killer vine look good I guess.Sound and score are the only 2 really good parts of the whole project. They are both quite creepy and effective.I can't really criticize the actors much because they just didn't have a lot to work with. On the other hand I have seen good performances in bad movies. Not in this one though.Conclusion: I didn't particularly enjoy it but I have seen worse efforts. If you have nothing else to watch I guess it could help you waste an hour and a half. I definitely will not be running to see anything new by the writer or director.",The Ruins

But not the contrived wanna-be movie like Killer Tomatoes, that was just dumb.The Ruins is not in the 10% of good movies, it is not in the 1% of excellent movies and it is not bad enough to be good. It's just like the wrapper on your hamburger. Functional, but disposable rubbish (and it leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth).Every other reviewer has covered the plot, the acting and the cinematography.

It worked far more successfully than Cabin Fever at this. So yep- a thumbs up from me, there are definitely far weaker examples in this sub-genre of horror.",The Ruins

Of all the creepy and disturbing scenes that The Ruins have, there is one that I felt through my whole body and I'm sure I will never forget this experience. You will know what I'm talking about when you see the movie.The movie has gore, but now I understand that's not the only way to do a great horror movie. Besides being such a great terrifying movie, The Ruins has a great cast that turns the film into a whole new level. The way the actors and actress acted made the flick much more interesting and realistic. And when talking about being realistic, the CGI did an excellent job doing that. The vines were scary, frightening, and smart too. At least, that's what I think. I never expected these plants imitating cell phones ringing sound and people's voice.

The film is very effective and is definitely the only horror film this year that left that uncomfortable knot in my stomach. When i think of a horror film, I expect to see a film that truly scares you and makes you uncomfortable. Horror movies nowadays do not do that. Heck, most of the time your sitting there laughing at the screen. The Ruins actually brought back that uncomfortable feeling but still made the movie entertaining. The acting is very good for a horror film. The only complaints I have is how fast the 4 Americans decide to join the German. It seemed like only a minute after meeting that they decided to join each other. Also, I didn't like how the film kept building up but the ending was kind of a letdown, not too much of a problem in the scheme of things. I still enjoyed it. Overall, the film is amazing and I do recommend it to horror buffs who are looking for a change in the horror genre. The Ruins is scary, intense, shocking, crazy, freaky, and downright horrific. This is definitely the best horror film of the year.",The Ruins

Because the evil in this movie is not something one is likely to ever encounter, those who handle horror movies poorly might actually be able to handle this one here. As a long time horror fan, I will be more than happy to purchase this when it comes out on DVD and add it to my horror collection. Long story short, this movie is good times. It was one of the more original ideas when all the horror movies tend to be crazy psychotic people who like to kill more than anything else. It was a creative breath of fresh air.

Based off the book, it blew the big one. They took the strongest characters from the book and turned them into the weakest and the weakest into the strongest. Plus, it has a happy ending, one of them gets away!!! No one lives in the book, I was thrilled to be seeing something with a dark ending that wasn't all Hollywood happy. Boy, was I disappointed. Also, I didn't understand why they killed Demetri in the method that they did since he's actually the one in Matthias's (sp) position. Once again, the strongest into the weakest. Matthias was an incredibly strong, intelligent young man who you thought might have a chance of surviving and instead they made him into the broken doll. Eric was the one who went crazy and Matthias actually dies at his hand and Stacey kills him because of the damage he's done to himself. ARGH!? Why were these events any harder to stay true to then what they did in the movie?! Oh yeah, I know why, happy ending and the chance to make a sequel.I didn't like the movie in the aspect that it didn't give the vines the intelligence that they had in the book. You kind of gather that they're a thinking entity but not really. Plus, the movie doesn't show how vicious these vines are.I could go on and on ripping apart the movie based off the book because the book was a fantastic and chilling read. It left you distrusting plants and thinking that excavation sites that are ""off the beaten path"" are worth avoiding. The movie had it's good moments but it was nowhere near as disturbing as the book. So, I recommend for the full experience, read the book but do so after viewing the movie.",The Ruins
194,husks,Your basic long scream of horror.,10,6 April 2008,"Based on a the horror novel by Scott Smith, who also wrote the screenplay, The Ruins is a harrowing tale about several American tourists vacationing south of the border who come across a monstrous evil living within the Mexican jungle. While not a masterpiece by any means, The Ruins is a satisfying horror film with enough gut-wrenching gore and genuine scares to please most horror fans.The setup is cliché horror (debaucherous white teenagers unfortunately stumble upon something that wants to kill them), until you see what lives in the ruins, which is much more frightening than any human or typical science fiction creature. That's all I'll say to avoid ruining The Ruins for anyone--just believe me when I say that it'll scare even the most hardened horror fan.Other then an unbalanced ratio of oily man chest to naked girls (you virtually no skin other than the buff dudes who seem to have some sort of freaking allergy to t-shirts), The Ruins is actually quite good. There are moments that are truly terrifying that do not use blood to get a reaction out of the audience, but there are also moments that are almost unbearably grisly, which is a good balance to have in a horror movie.Despite its shortcomings, The Ruins is an absolutely must-see for horror enthusiasts, and a reasonably faithful adaptation of the book that shouldn't offend those who enjoyed the novel by the same name.",The Ruins
195,AlanJ2,"One of the worst, if not the worst horror movie of the current run",1,3 July 2008,"I like horror and also the 'Paradise Lost' or 'Back-packer Horror' genre of which this is an example. The premise is OK and even a little original. But even so the film is so ineptly scripted it might serve as an effective teaching tool in how not to construct movies. The real shock is that a company like Dreamworks could put their name to such an amateurish effort. The story starts reasonably enough but once the threat begins nobody bothers with any story logic whatsoever. To give just one obvious example. A vital mobile phone is heard in a dark chasm. The phone is the group's only hope of getting help. People are lowered down at great risk to try and get it. One is injured in the attempt but they reach the bottom and....? And nothing at all! The phone is simply forgotten and they pull up their comrades and settle down for the night! No surrpise then that the ending is utterly feeble, indeed no attempt has really been made to mount any kind of conclusion. And what makes it worse is that the acting is OK, far better than this lame material deserves.",The Ruins
196,kanerazor,"Fun, sexy horror film",8,6 April 2008,"The Ruins is a tense, consistently entertaining scare flick that will give all horror fans their money's worth. The early scenes of the film don't add too much, b/c it's obvious where the story's gonna go, but none of the scenes are boring and it is necessary that we know the characters somewhat in order to care about their plight.Once the action shifts to the archaeological site, the intensity never really lets up. We feel the characters' nonstop fear, as they seemingly have no way out of their predicament and they're being attacked by something they don't know in ways they are virtually powerless to anticipate or prevent. While it does become a little easy to predict the story towards the end, that doesn't keep The Ruins from being a really fun popcorn flick.One thing to my fellow male fans: in this era of political correctness and PG-13 ratings, I have no qualms about lauding The Ruins for its nudity. The hot blonde girl shows everything, while the only male nudity is virtually subliminal:)",The Ruins

The concept of a horror movie involving ancient Mexican stuff is pretty cool and original. But that's as far as it goes. You never really know what's going on here. I can't give any information away, but the ""evil forces"" here in my opinion have nothing to do with ancient Mayan folks. And I ain't no Mayan but anyone equipped with a brain will agree. I'd stay away from this waste of time if you're in the mood for a horror movie. I guess I was maybe expecting a horror movie and maybe some crazy people running around like the ones in Apocalypto!!

I was quite interested in some aspects of the story but in the end it turned out to be quite a waste of time.The plot is simple (which isn't always a bad thing) and doesn't deliver much. The characters are quite flat and useless to be honest. They fall under the category of ""horror protagonists that can not do anything but complain and scream"".Overall, there isn't much to say about this film.

I stumbled across this and have to say I was greatly rewarded.I found the film engaging and when the film was beginning, you immediately can identify and empathise with each of the protagonists.The build up was perfect, based around frustration, misunderstanding and confusion. It builds swiftly at a great pace which reveals only what it wants when it wants and some great psychological twists to boot.This is a creative, straight horror film.

203,d-christianson-1,Better than your standard gore-slasher.,9,6 September 2013,"This is not an action packed movie constant gore, violence and blood. Rather its a journey into what creeps you out, having something sinister growing inside you. There's no psychotic killer, no giant evil monster, but an ever growing sense of unease and some well placed fx that is more unnerving than gory. Very little character development, but so what, the acting is good enough, and characters react realistically - but there is quite a bit of screaming, which grates on my nerves.If you're looking for a bloodbath, or extreme gore, stay away as you'll probably find this boring. I liked the psychology of what The Ruins has to offer - a new solid twist on horror. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was the very end - lame.

205,GodsPrototype,Creepy plants & a hot sun entwine to make a very cool Horror Movie,8,5 April 2009,"Firstly I wasn't too keen on seeing a horror movie about a plant that kills humans as I was never keen on 'Invasion of the body snatchers', 'Little shop of Horrors' or even 'Cabin Fever' which wishes it could have been as good as this film. So I saw it with an open mind and was well rewarded for my time. The Ruins is a damn good modern horror movie with an air of sexiness & coolness, surprising then that comedian Ben Stiller produced it.The set-up is a usual one as 4 American holidaymakers who are young and beautiful are led off the beaten track by a German explorer looking for his brother. Leading them to a supposed archaeological site at the ruins of an ancient Mayan Temple they discover that no one who sets foot on the temple ever leaves untouched by the horrors and the mysterious vine that is twisted all over the structure, not to mention the gun-wielding Mayan villagers below.The special effects team and production designers gave the temple a fantastic look and made the entire movie absolutely believable. I'm a big fan of horror movies set in the daylight as it makes the filmmakers work harder to scare you and The Ruins works well to portray a sense of fear and despair under the glaring hot sun.The acting is to a good standard and it was nice to see Jena Malone all grown up and ahemin a bikini. Laura Ramsey does a good job with hardly any clothes on for most of the movie and it makes the moment when she slices herself to shreds to remove the vine ever more horrific and somewhat saddening.The blood & guts is not as gory as one would expect but what it does do is make up for it toward the end of the movie in a segment lasting 10 minutes in which everything goes wrong for the characters. One moment in particular with the amateur amputation is particularly cringe worthy, it is one of the best 'leg moments' in film aside from 'Black Hawk Down' that I have seen in a while. I never thought cutting off a man's leg with a rock and a small knife would be entirely possible but the film proves otherwise.And to the vines themselvesit's not really explained why or what the vines are the way they are but it is commented that they may have been part of the Mayan's sacrifice practices. The special effects are top notch and the design and creation of the Vine 'Character' is very good. There are no ghosts, aliens, monsters or human killers as the bad guy in this movie is just an evil plant with unspoken motives.It shouldn't work but it does work, very well. The horror is not so much in what we see on screen but in the psychological aspect and the way the Vine affects the characters as their time on the ruins goes on and on. When everything comes together it all makes for a very sexy and cool horror movie that stands out from the rest of the pack.Hopefully they won't make a sequel so we can just enjoy this film on its own. Worth seeing as it is one of the better original horror films of the past decade. I still think the alternative ending was better though. Very good film. 8/10",The Ruins

207,SpikyRaindrop,Not entirely bad,6,21 June 2014,"This was not an entirely bad movie, nor was it a very good movie. The story was good. I really liked the mysterious plant idea and I don't care that after warts you don't know how and why. The only thing I am really bugged about is this. The Mexicans chased them ( in the begging) on the temple (because they where already infected). Why don't they scare them off before going into the infected area? It could have saved a lot of trouble and the people would still all be alive! But yeah, then you wouldn't have a movie. It's one of those things you think of after seeing the movie. It's just one of those holes you sometimes counter in a movie.The acting was okay. It's just the same group of teens you see in almost every horror movie except these teens weren't dumb, they where actually quite okay/smart for a horror movie.It was an okay horror movie.

It's almost like this movie was directed and written by two different people. It'll never be a classic but it did, by the skin of it's teeth, redeem itself by the middle. I particularly liked the ""bad guy"" and it's abilities. I won't go into details and spoil the movie but trust me, you'll enjoy it.

As someone else stated... not too many ""scary movie"" clichés and the acting was actually pretty good.So here goes, watch for spoilers.These college kids are on vacation. Right. In Mexico. Right. They meet up with a bunch of strangers and decide to go exploring in the middle of nowhere with them alone. Right. Seen it all before. Wrong.So the get to the ruins and are surrounded by Mayan guardians that apparently are trying to keep the evil that is in the vines growing on the pyramid from spreading. They WILL kill anyone that touches the vines... anyone. Once the kids find out they will be killed if they try to leave (due to one being shot already), they decide to wait it out on top of the pyramid. The rest of the film is pretty much them going into and out of the hole in the top, doing surgery with hunting knives, going crazy, fighting and trying to escape.... someone might get out alive, but they might not, I'm not going to tell you.Overall, the killer vines were done pretty well, not too much cheese, but the singing flowers were a little over the top... you'll see.I give a 3.5 out of 5 on the Gargamel Scale with points for nudity, explosion-and/or-gunfire, and story with a half point for acting and no points for car chase.",The Ruins

The five then decide to go to the ruins, an area not yet discovered. Following up to much movies like descent or the cave, the friends decide to journey and wind up being killed off one by one. Though it had some moments of gore and suspense, I have got to say that the concept was actually believe to where it felt like it could happen to anyone. The cast was great every actor did their job well and made me actually feel sorry and to survive.

211,Doctor_Mongoose,So predictable that it completely RUINS the film...,3,30 June 2009,"Basic plot summary is that 2 American couples decide to go on holiday to party and chill by the pool. One of the girls then somehow manages to lose an ear-ring which is coincidently found by a German dude who just so happens to be heading off the next day to visit some ancient Mayan ruins that hardly anyone has been to before. After talking to the German guy for 5 seconds the gang decide what the heck lets go with him. What could possibly go wrong? Despite being well shot, the film is just as stupid as the 4 main characters. All the characters are complete horror movie staples, such as the smart sensible quiet guy who comes out of his shell when trouble is a-foot. Other characters include the guy who is vaguely comic relief, signified by daft hair, the bimbo and the whiny useless chick. The situation they find themselves in is completely ludicrous and then when you realise what the main evil thing is you just laugh because it is completely ridiculous.Obviously being a horror movie the hot blonde has to get naked and then find excuses to take her clothes off whenever possible and there has got to be lots of blood and gore. The movie succeeds with both these tasks but in the most mundane routine way possible which leaves you completely uninterested in the plot and in the characters fates.In summary, its a below average horror movie that doesn't really make any sense and you know exactly what is going to happen the entire way through which just makes the whole experience feel old and overgrown.",The Ruins

Some young tourists are ""quarantined"" in some ruins by locals because of rather strange plant-like creatures that infect them. The creatures potentially are quite interesting, especially in how they mimic sound, but this hardly matters, since what we're treated to are a lot of unpleasant operations, where legs are cut off and knives are stuck under the skin to get the invading little critters out of their victims' bodies. I also had to scratch my head at why, if the locals wanted to keep the visitors from infecting the areas around them, why they didn't just kill them, rather than go to all that effort to keep them prisoner??What could have been a fun horror is, instead, grim, slow and tedious.",The Ruins

The plot is not original: the story of a group of friends who decide to visit a place – in this case old ruins – far away from the city and can't get out of there was used many times in cinema. Obviously, there are many scenes that may be a little hard to watch for those who are more sensitive – pure exploitation to get audience. There is, however, a big hole in the story – many things were left in the air without explanation.Who were those people speaking that strange language? What they wanted and what they were afraid of? Was that pyramid where the group of friends got stuck cursed? What kind of plat was that and why did it sound like a cellphone? Those questions were not explained and when the film ends, we don't know what all those things were about.'The Ruins' is the kind of movie that we have already seen many times and unfortunately continue to make the same mistakes.

Now, half a year later, I watched it privately. And I saw that my decision not to watch it in the first place was WRONG! This was a great, thrilling movie. It was exactly what I would have expected from a good, decent horror movie. I had a great time watching it. The story was very frightening and exciting.If I had to compare level of suspense, special effects, occult background, unknown origin etc. to another movie I'd recall the classic ""The Evil Dead"" immediately. Very great horror movie as well.Many commentators complained they were lost on the monster's features. Well, then they would have been lost on films like The Evil Dead as well. I wasn't lost at all. Without creating spoilers, I'd like interested parties to refer to a thing like ""Impatiens glandulifera"" or ""Nepenthes"". The movie did just exaggerate such things.I found everything in the movie quite consistent, logic and story driven. Very good plot! There was one very funny moment in the movie (I guess this won't be a spoiler): Someone in the group said ""We Americans don't just get lost!"". Very cool! - ""Ruins"" is an Australian movie. Nice reprise to the 80's, where in US American movies there was always one pathetic moment (""You are... American?

215,ricky_says_hi,surprisingly good modern horror piece,8,16 August 2010,"I went into this film not knowing what the main plot would be, all I knew was that it was horror and involved a set of Mayan ruins but it was definitely one of the best horror films I've seen recently.The plot follows four American tourists - Jeff, Amy, Eric and Stacy on holiday in Mexico who go with Mathias - a German tourist whose brother is missing - to an old Mayan ruin covered in vines. the locals in the jungle don't want them to leave and they end up trapped in the ruins. it's eventually revealed the vines covering the ruin are a carnivorous plant that spreads fast, hence the natives trying to contain it. the plant can mimic a sound and it can grow on anything. this leads to a truly unnerving scene where Stacy starts screaming in hysteria only to calm down and the plants then mimic the sounds of her screaming so the group are forced to listen to it.The characters are pretty well developed and likable enough (except for Amy who's a bit of a bitch) and outside the usual horror stereotypes. for example Jeff assumes control of the situation and tries to make most of the decisions for the group and they are realistic couples (ie not one slutty girl with a jerky guy and two nicer ones).the movie has its share of gore but does have some restraint and avoids going down the Saw, Hostel, Chucky route and having senseless gore everywhere. it only reserves the gore for when it's needed. the movie relies a lot on atmosphere to create tension and is more about how the characters deal with their situation. it avoids being the predictable horror film as it waits for a good while before characters start dying so you end up hoping a few of them might make it out.the movie does have some really powerful and freaky scenes, most notably where the Mayans shoot a little boy who touched the vines (Amy threw it at him) and another one where they find that the vines can start growing inside people which leads to Stacy becoming paranoid that the vines are inside her so she starts cutting herself up to try and get the vines out.overall, a good horror flick and don't be put off by the fact that plants are the main villains. it's done pretty well and should be fun to watch.",The Ruins

It literally got under my skin at a few parts and made me squirm, and that pretty tough to do to me. The story resembled a Stephen King-esquire short story. It was grim, unpleasant, and gory.

The gore was just about right. I did have an issue with character development, i think we got to know them but not enough to feel them emotionally. Physically i felt their pain as they chopped off legs and cut through skin, twas an eerie feeling. I think we didn't get enough action from the plant itself, only a feeling of possibility, ""what might happen"". I know Smith had to use the book as the guideline, but what he missed was that when reading a book, our imagination is left to its own devices, but when we see a movie, we are subjected to the directors/writers creation, so they need to bring the essence to us.

222,timharries,The Plant does not stay in the picture!,6,18 December 2008,"In the extras for this film, somebody points out the lack of ""killer plant"" movies that have been made. Though the individual neglects to mention ""Day of the Triffids"" (based on the book by John Wyndham) it is true that this particular specimen hasn't really been focused upon in the horror film.The reasons for this become gratingly obvious in ""The Ruins"", a truly unique mix of the viscerally grotesque juxtaposed with the bustling tendrils of a rather large plant.Unsurprisingly, the plant in question (and in its full glory is rather impressive, one has to point out) doesn't really have an awful lot to do. It is the human players that are the agents of barbarism here. The villagers holding them captive atop the Aztec ruin not only dispatch one of the group for little more than raising his voice, but they also turn their guns on one of their own children.The role of the plant then, is marginalized. It can imitate sounds rather well though. Playing tricks on the protagonists's already fragile states of mind, it provides a catalyst for some of the more fiendish scenarios that follow. Admittedly, it does also dispatch the incapacitated ""Mathias"", but with his legs broken and weak as a kitten, this hardly poses a great challenge.It's only other victim is really one of suggestion - at the sight of a few wormy tendrils lodged beneath her skin the poor girl in question quickly sets out, (in one of the film's most effective and truly unnerving scenes) at hacking away at her legs and face, causing far more damage to herself in the process  such brio culminating with her mortally wounding another of the film's key players.The message is clear then, riffing along the lines of the ""guns don't kill people, people do"", the real enemy in this film is us, the plant is simply the bully in the playground stirring up an already volatile atmosphere, the rest is left for us to tear down.Hardly the most original of statements, but orchestrated intelligently enough here, yet carried off so much more effectively in films carrying the same message as well as ""monsters"" we can be frightened of: ""28 Days Later"" ""Dawn Of the Dead"" (2004) and more recently ""The Mist"". Films that all tick the requisite boxes without losing the viewer along the way.The problem then that plagues this film, is in the choice of its ""other"" - in this case, an overgrown clump of poison ivy. The sad fact is that killer plants have never been, nor ever will be, scary...at all. Their daft, scuttling presence here simply jars with the other, more effective elements of the story - such as the rapid breakdown of order that takes place within the group and the truly awful decisions they are forced to make as a consequence.Should we try and put mutated plants into any sort of cannon at all then surely they belong to the 1950's cycle of ""atomic threat"" monster movies. Their use by turns campy (""Little Shop..."") or unintentionally amusing. (Day Of..."") Two states that more or less capture the full extent of their talents.That said, The Ruins has a lot to recommend it. The scenes capturing the gruesome are uncomfortably realistic and provide much of the film's gravitas, the performances from the key players suitably frazzled, as the true nature of their situation dawns on them and it is rarely dull -coming in at a lean 1 hour 30 minutes the film never outstays its welcome. Next time though, leave the twitching, singing legacy of ""Audrey"" out of the picture.",The Ruins

Something unchallenging and unpretentious to read inbetween your Dostoevskys and Nabokovs. When i read it I was already aware that there was a movie adaptation of it, so I decided to read the book before watching the movie, as I generally do (unless the movie's story strikes me as either too ludicrous to bother a read or written by awful writers like Chuck Palahniuk or Bret Easton Ellis, in which case I skip the book). The movie of course does not cover all of the situations that arrive in the book; everything is simplified and compressed or left out. Despite that, the movie does a good job of adapting the story, veering aptly from certain ludicrous situations that are described in the book. What pleased me the most in watching it, however was the fact that the characters and horrors that they experience are somewhat different form the book. What certain characters endure in the movie is not the same as the book down to the very ending of the film being completely different from the on the book. Which meant that, despite having read the novel, I still couldn't be quite certain which destiny each character would meet, therefore making a somewhat fresher experience and increasing the suspense significantly. I'm sure the screenwriter (who is also the author of the novel) did that to offer a fresher movieviewing experience to someone who had read the book and di so without veering form the plot outlines of the book. As for the direction, it was made with tact and seriousness, something not quite easy considering the source material. Overall a fun movie.",The Ruins
224,BSS,RUINED my night...,2,7 April 2008,"I have not read the book, but this movie is terrible. The plot was laughable and predictable. The acting was lame, as these performances made Steven Seagal look like Robert De Niro. Characterization was non-existent; it was extremely difficult to care about the characters because they were basically without personality. Surprisingly there was little effort to develop the characters and, as a result, they were extremely one-dimensional. As for the ending, it seems that the makers of this movie didn't really know what to do, so they just ended it! You'll find yourself asking, ""Is that it?"" Normally my ratings are pretty close to IMDb users' assessments of movies, but this one was not even remotely close. A total waste of time and money. I cannot put into words how bad this movie was.",The Ruins

Could be a ok/terrible but enjoyable backpacker horror movie about a cursed Mayan temple. All I have to say is carnivorous vines with marijuana shaped leaves that mimic cell phone ringtones.

Once again however I'm reminded of one thing: Don't ever get into an emergency or survival situation with millennials. These guys are the most out of touch, pampered, and self indulged nit wits in our country. The bickering that goes on especially from the useless girls is maddening. And when their friend has just been executed and they're at the top of the monument when the one guy suggests they save the water when the ditzy blonde grabs the bottle...the other guy actually says, 'Jeff....she's thirsty' LOL! But then I remembered that millennials think they have to hydrate every 15 minutes or they'll dry up and die.

228,dpo-6,Great flick for the horror fan!,9,6 April 2008,"I really enjoyed this film because it was finally a little something different. It was a first rate horror movie that really didn't have to show much horror to still make the audience feel uneasy. Anyone who read the book (which I loved by the way) would agree that the carnivorous fauna that covers the ruins and engulfs anyone foolish enough to touch it, was a major part of the story. However, the movie didn't play on the plants as much as it did the characters and the thoughts of being lost, isolated, quarantined. I am glad the antagonist was not shown too much so it was always a treat to see the nasty vines when they made an appearance. The young actors all did a fine job and the gore level was great, not too much, but very realistic and stomach turning when it was shown. I really liked this movie, the pace was great and the build up to the actual plot was fantastic, keeping you wondering what was going to happen. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good old fashioned American horror flick!",The Ruins
229,Nadrizzle,"Love the book, the movie is severely lacking",1,25 August 2021,"I guess killer vines aren't easy to translate onto the big screen. I have read the book over and over since it came out when I was in high school. I love it so much that I own two copies - a hardcover and a small portable copy. Many others who I have recommended it to really enjoyed it.That's why it is so frustrating to see what a failure this movie was, which is a shame since the author helped write most of the script. He swapped the characters around in the film and removed most, if not all, of their backstory. I understand a movie cannot fully embody the essence of a book, but while reading, you become familiar and somewhat attached to the characters, which allows you to relate with them in a chilling way that leaves you a bit unsettled when they're being tortured and killed off by this sentient plant. In the movie, I could not bring myself to care about what happens to these people as I have zero emotional investment to them, nor do I even gain any interest in them as they are the most bland characters I've ever seen in a film besides Twilight. They could have discussed the hardships of no food/drink, missing their families, or spoke more about their hopes and dreams for when they get back home; literally anything besides the wasted screen time of just staring at each other while showing limited emotional or realistic reactions to the events around them.What's worse, they not only stripped the characters of their personalities (and, honestly, the vine of it's personality in the book) but then shuffled them around for no discernible reason. It was done in a very forced way that didn't feel natural, especially when their fates and form of death were also mis-matched. In the book, the Greek is the one who breaks his back. This creates a haunting experience since we don't know what's wrong with him right away, because he can't speak English to tell the others how severely he is hurt. Extra unsettling is the fact that he cannot communicate with any of them to consent to having his legs amputated, creating a very squeamish and gut-wrenching chapter in the book. The film adaptation removes this horrific factor by making Matias the one to fall, they immediately figure out he broke his back, and then Matias begs the others to cut off his legs. That's only one example of many things that went wrong and caused this movie to fall completely flat. I won't even waste my time on explaining how disappointed I was that the vines were laughable at best, rather than the terrifying entity described in the book.Lastly, the fact that Amy survives is an absolute joke. In the book, there are no survivors- a very chilling ending to a depressing story. The whole ""we need a happy ending for the audience"" was the final unrealistic bow slapped on top of this flop of a film. If they were going to choose to allow someone to survive, then they should have included the unreleased ending which was MUCH more haunting and realistic, showing how deadly and intrusive these vines are.Overall, I'm disappointed in Ben Stiller and Scott Smith for failing to create a movie that even suggests a proper attempt of doing the book any justice. Translating a far-fetched idea onto the big screen is something that cannot be skimped on. You had the money to do it and do it right, but this was not it.",The Ruins
230,apetitefor,It can kill a viewer,1,12 July 2008,"Unfortunately with its pure and amazing dumbness. I don't like this movie at all, neither its special effects nor its actors. Everything is so messed up, with tuns of stupid dialogues that can get you so bored that you will probably start to enjoy more the nature in this movie,rather trying to understand why somebody created something like this. Most of the modern horror movies are not trying to come up with something interesting as and idea, they just want to put as much blood as they can, so the viewer can turn his head in disgust or for the hardcore fans,enjoy the cutting, the burning and the screaming of the victims. This movie is all that, but in backwards. I will need tons of virtual internet paper to explain why this movie ended being so bad, but its is no worth it, because after the first 5 minutes of it you will see it for yourself. Maybe I am way beyond the critical level or just another user that can't understand why this movie is so damn good for most of the views.

I saw this movie The Ruins a couple weeks ago at an advanced screening, and I gotta tell you it is awesome. The gore was great, the acting was a little above mediocre and the nudity was pointless as usual. I'm pretty sure that the critics are going to give this movie a bad rating because of the cheap scares the movie sometimes deployed but if you ignore that it can be really suspenseful and the other scares other than the cheap scares will scare you out of your seat! The vines can look a little cheesy at first but then it starts getting scary. I REALLY recommend this movie for you hard-core horror fans.",The Ruins
232,Michaelrsear,Good Film,7,23 September 2008,"I had low expectations for ""The Ruins"" but was pleasantly surprised. The storyline, while somewhat common to horror movies; i.e. Young people out to have fun and adventure find monster and thus are systematically eliminated in grotesque ways - had enough twists to be interesting. The cast was good, the acting good, the set good and the dialog good  overall, a good film. Even as a huge horror fan who thought he had seen it all, there were moments I couldn't watch such as amputations, and self mutilation. There were also disturbingly unexpected moments such as when a young child is shot in the head  which, while it was effective in shocking the audience, I could have done without. But on a whole it was a good example of an unexpected movie experience which these days, as far as teenage horror movies are concerned, is an accomplishment in and of its self. I would recommend it.Michael",The Ruins

The acting was serviceable, as was the atmesphere and the special effects. Nothing horrible. The whole thing just seemed mediocre. It certainly had its gross, gory moments, but the rest of the time it seemed like your typical, bland pg-13 horror flick. The fact that the exposition was many times more time consuming and really far better made than the throw away climax is really just an indicator that the director didn't really care.

236,alvinvigil,"""A decent enough thrill ride""",8,4 April 2008,"Just when you thought it was safe to vacation in Mexico comes the new horror film The Ruins, based on a pretty cool book (or so I've heard) by Scott Smith, who adapted his own book into the screenplay. Four attractive American college students, Jeff, Eric, Amy and Stacy meet a German traveler while on vacation in Cancun who tells them about a hidden Mayan archaeological dig site in the jungle he plans to explore. Do they tag along, of course they do. So off they all go after a night of heavy tequila drinking along with another attractive Greek guy. Almost immediately, they sense something is wrong upon arriving at the Mayan temple, inundated with vines and beautiful red rosy flowers. This isn't your typical Little Shop of Horrors vegetation, either. The ruins have an evil aura about them and the unsuspecting vacationers are suddenly trapped on top of the ruin, as some Mayan descendants make camp around the ruin so as to keep them from escaping the ancient temple. There's plenty of good stuff in The Ruins. Queensland, Australia substitutes for the mountains and landscape of Cancun (must be those extra tax breaks). And the young cast are good enough to add a sense of realism to the horror that is brought upon them. The Mayan cast, also, who ""quarantine"" the tourists on top of the Mayan ruin, are quite effective. First time director, Carter Smith, definitely brings on the chills and thrills in The Ruins. There's a psychological nature that plays well, but I've got to tell you, this movie is pretty damn gross. Smith goes straight for the gut-wrenching thrills. It's pretty graphic as far as graphic violence can go. You'll be squirming in your seat during a couple of horrific scenes when a traveler is injured with a broken back and another has these creepy-crawler vines inside of her body as they try to take them out using a hunting knife. Lots of gore and blood here, so in that sense, it delivers. The Ruins is a decent enough thrill ride that will make you think twice about visiting any type of ancient ruin yet to be discovered while on your next vacation in the jungle.",The Ruins
237,digginglife66-1,Good for it's genre,8,22 April 2008,"The Ruins has it's typical horror movie cliché's, but aren't really that big of a deal compared to the overall effect the movie has. The nudity scene is very short and not very explicit, the cheating girlfriend thing isn't that big of a deal either. The only corny parts in this movie I would consider mediocre and not that big of a deal.The acting was overall pretty decent. I've always been impressed with Ashmore since he played the only good role in the ""Animorphs"" TV series. I was also very impressed with Jonathan Tucker's acting. Malone and Ramsey through in great performances as well.The chills in this movie were real. My fiancé' was so disturbed during this movie that at one point he started biting my scalp. The movie also uses an excellent balance of silence and music in appropriate sections. And the fact that the audience is kept in the dark about some of ""why"" this was going on is also a big bonus. There isn't an overabundance of blood and gore, but it's great for this movie. Kudos for a horror flick that does it right!",The Ruins
238,IanHackbarth,Not at all a Bad Film,8,4 April 2008,"Well, I went into this thinking that it would be yet another American horror film. You know predictable and not even scary. And was glad to be wrong. While there were some predictable points I could not guess what was going to happen throughout the entire movie, as I normally can.The film starts in a Hostile-isk sort of way. Four Americans are on vacation in, I am guessing Mexico, when, the day before they are scheduled to go home, they are lead to a secret Myan ruin by a German guy looking for his brother. However when they reach the Ruins they find that everything is far from okay.Without spoiling anything I will just say that from the previews I guessed that the evilness or whatever you want to call it, was snakes. I was wrong. Instead the monster is something that I actually cannot recall being featured in any horror movie for at least a while. Proving that there are some original Ideas out there. (Even if they have to be taken from a book)One other piece of advise, If you have a weak stomach I would recommend that you don't eat anything during this movie.The only negative thing I have to say is that I did not like the ending. Again I will not spoil anything, but based on another review from this site that said the ending was good and not done very often I was expecting more.The bottom line is, you really should see this movie. It actually is scary, but mostly disturbing. And bravo to Hollywood for giving yet another reason to stay home.",The Ruins
239,Arenarocker05,Graphic and Disturbing,7,10 July 2008,"Could this be the best horror film so far this year? Well when you take a look at some of the horror films we see today like ""The Eye"", ""Prom Night"", ""Shutter"", and ""One Missed Call"", it damn well could be. Because lets face it; those movies I just listed flat-out sucked and I didn't even have to see them to find out for myself. However, this movie on the other hand delivers a couple of scares and some intensely disturbing images that will make you look the other way.The film focuses on four college students who are on a vacation in Mexico and then suddenly they meet a stranger who invites them to a place that is not even on the map, (So far there is already a typical horror cliché). Anyway, they go to a sight where an ancient Mayan Temple stands, hopping to find the stranger's brother who was missing somewhere among the ruins. Afterwards bizarre events begin to happen and the only thing left for these unsuspected individuals is to survive.In my opinion, this film is good for its genre. It does follow some patterns on how to make a successful horror movie. The acting is decent and the characters do a nice job holding it together, rather than just falling apart all at once. Now I don't know how accurate this is to the book because I never read it but I'm sure the book is just as graphic as the movie, maybe worse. So to rap it up, if your looking to avoid a bad remake of an original horror piece or some Japanese film turned upside down, give this film a shot.

I don't have anything against a movie having a low budget as long as the producer and director are creative. Several of my favourite movies from the last couple of years are actually in that category because they found creative ways around the monetary limitations.And I can see where they are coming from in this movie. They are trying to build up some tension with the dialogue and give us personal connections to the actors. However, they fail utterly. It's hysterical, stupid and very annoying. No, I can't feel sorry for you because you are American and you don't understand what they are saying. No I can't feel for you because you are stupid enough to go to that awful place that even a blind person could see was dangerous.This is one of the worst movies I've seen and I didn't even see the point to finish it.

244,nyFITguy,"A very strong and solid film, but definitely needed some more work",8,6 April 2008,"I've been waiting for this movie for a long time and have been excited ever since i saw the trailer back in January. When i first heard the storyline, i thought it was the dumbest thing ever, but the trailer really caught my attention. The cast looked great and it had a very psychological feel to it. It definitely came through, but there were things that weren't impressive.The Ruins tells the story of four friends vacationing in Mexico. They are approached by a native named Mathias who asks the friends to join him on a trip to ancient Mayan Ruins in the woods. The couples agree and are on their way the next morning. Before they know it, the group is shocked by local Mayans forcing them on top of the ruins, yet they don't know why. They have no way to escape of these ruins and don't know why they are being forced up there. What happens to them in the next couple days is unbelievable horror.Let's start with positive. The film really came through for me and i was pleased with the outcome. The cast was strong and i really came to love Stacy's (Laura Ramsey) character in the end. The characters did have their stupid moments at times, but were believable and you could tell they were desperate to get down there. The film has it's shocking moments and those come about halfway throughout the film. There was one scene that stood out and made me love the film more.OK, the more i think about it, the more negatives come to my mind. First, i would have loved more character development and transition scenes between the characters. i hear there was a bit more of character development scenes that were cut. Why? Next, i got a very different vibe from the trailer than the actual film. I was thinking this was going to be very minimal gore and i was not happy with what happened in the film. My rating would have definitely gone up if scenes of gore had been cut. I'm not a big fan of that. Not all gore was bad, but for the most part, it's not necessary. Finally, i'm sure this is the most talked about negative and that would be the ending. It felt rushed and quick. The truth is it could have been so much stronger of a film if it had more of a psychological ending. I was hoping for one thing to happen and something else ended up happening. That's my biggest disappointment for the film.Overall, The Ruins is a thrilling film and really takes you on a ride. For the most part, it's very strong and keeps you entertained, but it does have it's moments that many will not like and i can understand why. Casting was great and the plot was amazing. This is strongly recommended to see in the theater. it's a very good experience in the theater.7.5/10",The Ruins
245,brettmcneill,Good but could have been GREAT! (Spoliers),8,7 April 2008,"Generally, there are three types of people who will (or have) seen this film: 1. Horror buffs 2. Movie buffs or 3. people who have read the book. I fall under all three categories and after viewing the film I'm a little lost for words but I'll do my best to voice my opinion.The plot of the movie is a group of American tourists meet a German tourist who says he is going to an ancient mayan temple to find his brother. The other tourists want to see some ruins so they tag along with the German and his Greek friend. Went hey arrive at the temple they are surrounded by Mayan men who kill the Greek and force the rest up on the temple. The horror on the hill end up being a evil vine that eats flesh and can mimic sounds. Horrible events ensue.Now granted the movie's plot may not sound great (or even scary for that matter) but it is. i saw the trailer for this movie way back in January and thought, that looks way to scary to even sit through, but as time wore on i got more curious to what the movie was about (the trailer was very bland) so I decided to read the book. Well after I finished i thought the movie would be superb, especially since the author was penning the screenplay.Now I actually feel horrible because before I saw this I was telling my friends that this would be the next 'Exorcist' and would have people fainting and puking in their seats. Well on that front it fail miserably (thats my movie buff coming out). As an adaptation, it wasn't bad. All the deaths get jumbled around to other people but still have there effect as in the book. But the main thing about the adaptation is, IT'S TOO DAMN SHORT! The book was over 500 pages. The movie is a little over 90 mins. and you actually fell that its too short. Also the ending is abrupt and also (as many people has said) a cop out to the books ending. And I felt sort of cheated.But on as a horror buff I must say this movie is marvelous. the acting is a million times better than any other. The effects aren't cheesy. It actually relays more on psychological scares than gore (actually the gore is used psychologically) and it had one of the best premises in years but the problem it uses so many horror clichés (horror vacation, the sole girl surviving) but although they do this its actually logical and most things they do are very much so and, in a horror movie, logic is very rarely found.On the whole this movie was very good although it has its flaws but it's definitely the scare movie to see (I don't think next weeks Prom Night will top it.)

Characters simply swap fates. The Greek Demetri in exchange for Mathias the German. Eric for Stacy. Eric for Mathias And the ending is utterly altered to give the ray of hope American audiences crave. But what I usually would have found to be irritating became fresh. I no longer knew exactly what was going to happen while still having a vague feeling that it wasn't going to be good for anyone.

Simple premise to the story, cabin fever type, but well paced and well shot with special effects and musical score used sparingly added a little more realism.

And by the end of it, I knew it was great.The premise doesn't hold many surprises - the characters are just about the usual for a horror film, but they're not just victims for a slaughter. You get the sense going into it that they're regular people, and that makes it more nervwracking to see what they experience.The direction, scoring and effects provide to it - it's still a horror film, but it left me surprised - it dared to go to a slightly different place. It's intense, disturbing, violent and very bloody, but it doesn't back out. And by the end, your heart is still racing as you reach the end credits. The best horror film in a long time.",The Ruins

253,servoskull,Nip any thoughts of watching this in the bud!,3,22 July 2008,"The Ruins is one of those instantly forgettable horror films that Hollywood has literally saturated the genre with in recent years. You know the drill; a group of young adults played by sexy catalogue model types are picked off one by one at regular intervals thanks largely to some incredibly stupid decisions. You've no doubt seen it all before.Tourists trapped on a remote Mayan temple ruin overrun with flesh eating foliage is a premise that could have been something good but instead the film is predictable, very silly and definitely not something that will give you sleepless nights. I'd like to say there's one or two exceptional moments worthy of mention but there really are none. There's a couple of good gore moments but that's about it.If you're looking for some organic horror, check out Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Day of the Triffids and, to a lesser extent, Poltergeist and The Evil Dead instead.",The Ruins
254,Movielover134,Fun Horror movie!!,10,13 April 2008,"I saw the trailer to The Ruins back when I saw Cloverfield and thought, Wow that looks bad. As the release date got closer i started hearing good word of mouth and that the book was really good so i got excited to see it.I went and saw this with my dad and my friend and they both hated it said the plot was bad, the acting was OK, the vines should have been explained, but then again they both hate this kind of movie. I, on the other hand, thought the plot was good, the acting was very good, not every actor can make you feel horrible for them, the gore was very surprissing not half as bad as the trailer made it look, the deathes were well thought out, but there should have been one more character that got killed by the vines.All in all if you like this kind of movie you will love it, i did'nt read the book by the way, the gore isn't bad at all, and the ending was satisfiying. But if you don't like this kind of horror thriller look somewhere else this isn't your movie.",The Ruins
255,arghzombie,Yawn...,3,4 October 2008,"As much as I like the idea of a film that marches a clan of sexy, wealthy and smart tourists up a cursed hill side to be slowly tortured to death by evil ground-runner plants... Actually, no that's really crap idea isn't it. You can disregard all but the words ""slowly tortured""from that last remark (believe me, this was a process of torture that could only be described as slow).To anyone wondering what else to expect from this film other than the aforementioned, I can tell you that's pretty much the long and short of it - apart from a bunch of stereotypically uncooperative local military goons that for some reason had come to the conclusion that by letting the sexy tourists just get up and leave the mountain of vegetative death they could all expect to die with them!?! This is yet another of the string of lets-kill-the-dumb-Western-tourist films that may or may not have been spawned by the film Hostel, which was really the only descent one of the bunch. Frankly I'm sick of the concept, not because of any moral or inter-racial concerns. It's just become a total bore. This film, like all of the others, had characters spanning from one whiny character that didn't like being away from home to the cool outgoing character that loved being exposed to new things and welcomed cultural diversity. Why is it always the whiny character that's among the last to take the bullet in these things?Anyhow, apart from the occasional pang of mild nausea brought on by someone having an elongated piece of flesh dwelling, hyper intelligent vine dragged from under their skin, this film gave nothing by way of the sense of dread one might expect from a horror film that takes itself so seriously. The evil shrubbery was subject the typical overdoing of CGI and looked really stupid. Frankly I was more disturbed by the Little Shop of Horrors and I first saw that as stage production! I'm giving this film one star for each of the two descent gore scenes and two for the sexy cast (then I'm retracting one of those points for the fact that they had to rely on the sexy cast to sell tickets). If your thinking about going to see this one, do yourself a favour and buy yourself a houseplant with the ticket cost instead. Put some spooky lighting on it and you'll probably find it more frightening than this waste of film stock!",The Ruins
256,diki24,Good Horror movie after a long time,8,10 July 2008,"I am not a great Horror movie Fan. in fact i avoid them most of the times. However i somehow was attracted to see this one from the summary and description here on IMDb and more so because of some excellent stills from the movie. I can say that i wasn't disappointed at all. I can easily rate this as a highly above average Horror movie, with excellent Direction and Screenplay. Above average acting from all actors. Usually horror movies suffer because of pathetic acting, but this one scores very high on that front and i would say that each actor has done his part very well. Character development is given good space and time and you do feel the attachment. From the storyline angle, it is quite unique given the horror domain. Other aspect and to its advantage is that most of the film is in Day time and in spite of that it is able to create an atmosphere of chill and horror. There are few daylight scenes where i felt that ""Chill"". Overall, i would recommend this film to horror Fans and others alike.",The Ruins
257,brian_herm,Pretty good torture/snuff flick if you like that kinda stuff,8,5 April 2008,"I went into this movie not knowing what to expect. I like creepy, scary horror flicks. This one is murder, torture and mutilation, which I don't find entertaining. But it was very well done, the acting was good and the characters were very convincing. Not very many actually scary moments in the film, it's more of a ""what awful thing is going to happen to them next?"" It's quite realistic - there's no weird plot twists, no attempt to find out any secrets about the ruins or destroy the vines, or making elaborate escape plans, which I appreciated. The characters just try to survive (which they mostly don't). I think the nudity at the beginning wasn't quite so gratuitous. The contrast between the characters' liveliness and attractiveness at the beginning and their condition at the end was an integral part of the movie. Although I don't care for this type of movie, it was well done, and I could tell the audience was really drawn into it.",The Ruins

As a result of this, I was really excited to see it when it came to DVD. I thought that it was going to be a high-paced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a snail-paced predictable movie. It dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape, the ending was completely frustrating. I gave this movie two stars for one reason. This is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy slashing a bunch of people to death. The story makes this movie unique and provides a change for people who watch a lot of horror movies. Even though I don't like this movie, I recommend that all horror fans do see it at least once. You may surprisingly like it. As for this horror fan, all I can say is that I hope there ISN'T a sequel to this forgettable movie.",The Ruins
259,ibentmywookie244,One of the best horror movies I've ever seen---Major spoilers.,10,4 April 2008,"Going in to the Ruins, I expected mediocrity; the ads on TV sort of reminded me of the dreadful Turistas. I went to see it anyway, and it was fantastic: horrifying, disturbing, gory, and had moments where I even laughed out loud (after getting oral sex in the beginning--which you don't see--one of the main characters asks another why he seems so happy (afterwards), to which all he does is smirk). Then it begins to get eerie and ominous.A fellow tourist in the resort that these 4 Americans are befriends them, and asks if they want to go see some of the ruins--his brother had gone there with a girl he met and hasn't returned yet (their fates presumably revealed in the creepy opening scene). They go along, and after that, all hell breaks loose.Six people depart for the ruins, and when they get at the base of the temple, many of the locals surround them. Everything was fine until Amy steps on one of the vines, and the locals freak out, killing one of the group (someone that no one really knows)...The locals threaten the other five, and they go up the temple (where the locals wont follow them). Panicking, they try to think of a way out. Finally, they hear a cell phone ring coming from inside the temple. Mathias, the tourist whose brother has gone missing, notes that it is, in fact, his brothers cell phone ring tone. He volunteers to go into the temple via rope, but it breaks towards the top, and he falls down into the temple, paralyzed. Stacy goes down to help him, but finds that his back is broken. Amy goes down into the cave with a back board (so that Mathias could be brought up). Once they are back up on the temple, it is realized that the cell phone is the only way that they could help Mathias, as he is in a terrible condition.Amy and Stacy go into the temple to search for the phone, but find the source of the ringing, which, needless to say, is not actually a phone. Amy finds, to her horror, that the flowers, by vibrating the stems, can imitate sound. She touches the flower, and the vines begin to attack. They run back to the rope, and get pulled up.Stacy has a deep cut near her knee and Mathias is in terrible condition. They go to sleep, slightly frazzled and think they are going insane, and wake up to find that Mathias's legs have been completely overrun by the vines, and Stacy's leg is also covered, and a vine has entered her wound.That's where I will leave off with the summary, as it truly needs to be witnessed in order for the full effect of the movie.However, after this, the movie changes from just an ordinary, sub-grade horror film, to an actually intellectual story. Hunger, thirst, and paranoia set in (especially in Stacy--who wholeheartedly believes that the vines are crawling around in her), and she begins to descend into madness.This movie has two of the most disturbing scenes I have ever seen in a movie. I will not reveal what these are, but, trust me--after you have seen it you will Definitely know what ones I am referring to.It turns out, the locals were at first trying to protect the tourists, until Amy stepped onto a vine, when it turned into a quarantine. This is revealed in a chilling scene where Amy throws a peace of the vines at the locals, and it comes into contact with a young boy. The men tell him to get with the others by the temple, to which he refuses. The men reply with a bullet in his head. The vines grow anywhere--they even begin to grow on the tourists clothes.Go see this movie, it truly is a thought-provoking, stomach-churning, and disturbing movie. As I left the theaters I felt mortified (in a good way) about what I had just watched. It was spectacular, gory, intellectual, horrifying fun.",The Ruins

263,jhanse29,"A taught, fast paced horror flick",10,7 April 2008,"I recently finished reading the book in which this movie is based on. For starters, I am not much of a reader. I always have movies I'd rather watch and TV shows I have recorded that need to get caught up on to sit down and read. I went through The Ruins 506 pages within a week and a half. I couldn't put it down. It was suspenseful and claustrophobic and down right terrifying. I'd recommend anyone who likes a good horror read to get this book, even if you didn't care for the movie.Now onto the movie. The movie takes a lot from the book in it's short 90 minutes showing. A lot of what happened in the book is there in the movie. One thing the movie does to differ itself from the book, is it shuffles up the characters. Things that happened to the character in the book happens to a different character in the movie. Some people may not like this idea but for me it made the movie enough of a difference for it still to surprise me. The acting is great and the cinematography brings out the terror in the daylight which is somewhat unusual for a horror film.The one thing I felt this movie was lacking was the suspense and terror of being trapped onto of the ruins. The book really made you live the terror with these tourists. You felt there worry about water and food. The feeling of being stranded and desperate. The movie was so fast paced that it didn't evoke that same paranoia from the book. My opinion is the film could have been at least twenty minutes longer and really give the audience the feel of terror before the terrifying actually strikes.",The Ruins
264,chalcedonydream,It really isn't very good,3,12 June 2015,Flesh eating plants that can mimic mobile phone ring tones - really? I gave it 3 points because both Jonathan Tucker & Shawn Ashmore did a pretty good job (considering the low grade script and storyline). These are 2 pretty good young actors who have shown elsewhere that their abilities warrant more than this film allows. Sadly both females were harking back to the bad old days of horror where all women did was scream a lot. Hopefully they will be able to show more acting talent in future ventures.

However, if you've read it and then tried to describe the story to someone else, you probably had a tough time, right? Not too easy to convince people that a story about a killer vine could be a new horror classic. I think that problem is at play with the movie version of The Ruins. It just does not translate well off the page. Sometimes a book should stay a book, even when the author is recruited to write the screenplay. Do yourself a favor: Skip the movie and read the book. If you see the movie first, you'll never believe that the story you watched could be a good book, but you'll be missing out.",The Ruins

OK, I admit there weren't that many scares (maybe 1 that I jumped at) but the film keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The acting is superb and their emotions shine through, the death scenes were fairly gory and very depressing but the ending only slightly tips me off.Overall, The Ruins is a new type of horror that you should consider seeing, maybe once, but just a piece of advice: I recommend that you read the original novel by Scott Smith first before seeing the film.",The Ruins

270,pankoeken,Attack of the killer kudzu,3,22 December 2008,"Let me start by saying when I watch horror movies I'm willing to loosen certain criteria for what is needed for a good movie such as, logic, realistic scenarios, well developed characters etc...I saw The Ruins on cable with no previous knowledge other than having seen the trailer when it was released. At first it looked to be another crappy kids in trouble in a foreign country Hostel rip off a la Turistas. I never would have thought it possible it would suck even worse than Turistas.As I watched the evil vines slither towards their victim for the first time, I laughed out loud. I checked to make sure this was the same movie I had heard described as the scariest film of 2008 and based on the best horror novel in years. Yep. same one. Great to see hyperbole is still a replacement for a half decent film.As I continued to watch, determined to make it through this predatory plant fear fest, I was reminded of the segment of Creepshow that starred Stephen King. Its a great horror movie but that segment is easily the weakest part. Suddenly by comparison Stephen King covered by fungus didn't seem so bad.As The Ruins crept toward the ending just like the bloodthirsty begonias that was its scary monster I took comfort knowing it couldn't get worse. Wrong!!! The most annoying character, yeah I know its hard to pick just one, the whiny drunken, cheater scrawny chick is the one who lives???!!!

271,fetchmyslippers,Mediocre,5,5 July 2008,"When I first saw the initial previews for The Ruins, I'll admit I was somewhat enticed by the offering of a horror movie in which the ""bad guy"" is entirely an environmental element, for the same reason I enjoyed movies like ""Twister"", or ""Volcano"". Upon watching, I was given pretty much exactly what the preview promised, but really nothing more. The characters have been touted as believable, but I would beg to differ on several key points. The fact that it was the pair of girlfriends that first discovered the ""talking"" flowers, and yet then argued about suspicious sounds during the night regarding each others' actions, annoyed me to an extent. I would think that the both shocking and disturbing events of the previous day just might have possibly stuck with them a little bit longer, at least a lengthy enough duration that they might draw this connection between the two, ESPECIALLY after it's been well-established that they are the best of friends. I would expect more trust between the two.I felt that the ""character"" of the vines was not well enough developed, and they always seemed a little more like a slow, arduous plague than a creeping, living, thinking evil plant that devours humans. It felt a bit akin to getting your finger stuck in a Venus flytrap and just letting it sit there and suck the meat off your bones. True, the vines were all-encompassing and impossible to remove once implanted, but they still seemed to be too much an instinctual creature, and they never really worked out as a powerful element of the movie. I found that if anything, the characters seemed to kill each other off far more effectively than the plants. I would have liked to see a little bit more personality to the plants, especially following that tasty little introductory snippet, in which the girl with the cell phone is dragged violently into the darkness. A bit more time spent exploring the creepy, dank, dingy inside of the pyramid would have been enjoyable too, even if just to get a better sense of where these things originate.Overall, this movie is excellent for the stomach-turning bits of grit, grime, and gore, but poor development of the main character itself, The Ruins (and the vines growing over them), meant that this promising title turned into nothing more than an arduous siege of nerves as you watched the main characters kill each other in rather predictable, drawn-out ways.It should be noted though, that whenever now I meet somebody who thinks they truly have an iron gut and a will to match, I'll certainly recommend they try to sit through both the amputation and vine extraction scenes without cringing at least once. ; )",The Ruins

I think the movie does a great job of making you feel part of the action. As the protagonists, you try to figure out what the hell you would do in their situation.

There's 5 minutes of character development and then the rest of the movie is spent on the top of some temple in the middle of nowhere. They went inside it for like a minute. I want my money back.

And the effects are quite realistic as well. (That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your point of view).I'll leave out the plot details for those of you venturing out to see this on it's opening weekend, but to quote my fellow movie companions, ""I'm not sure there really was a plot"" to tell you about. The commercial for the film tells you basically everything.There are a few great intense scenes and the film is well shot. The acting is believable as well.So, not a bad movie, certainly not a great one, but if you approach this knowing what you're getting in to (an update of an old 1960's monster movie), you should fun for a couple of hours.Expect this one to open well and quickly disappear.

Like Hannibal, another promising movie that butchered the ending because of 'focus groups', The Ruins takes a classic ending and destroys it with the 'formula-proven' token girl survivor.

279,johngmiller,Where's Jack Nicholson when you need him?,6,5 May 2008,"By and large, horror fans are an undemanding lot. Oh sure, we appreciate fine acting and vicious plot twists. A horror film that contains these attributes is likely to be watched and pondered endlessly and then deemed a modern classic.But what really defines our interest is the disgust-o-meter; that subjective scale based on the level of depravity achieved in the key scenes of a film by which we rate horror flicks. The gore factor is the most primal reason we watch.Which gives us the sole reason that one might want to purchase a seat for ""The Ruins,"" the feature-length directorial debut for Carter Smith (VII). Any pretensions concerning innovative storytelling or creative plot development should be left at the door. Horror fans know who the star is.The film begins innocently enough (is there any other way?) on the last day of a vacation in Cancun for four college friends. They are approached by German tourist Mathias (Joe Anderson) who invites them to meet with his friends, who have gone to an unmapped site of Mayan ruins for an archaeological dig.The four friends are actually couples. Eric and Stacy (Shawn Ashmore and Laura Ramsey) are carefree and unpretentious, agreeing to the trip as a fun diversion. Amy (Gena Malone) is promiscuous and timid, agreeing only because everyone else wants to go.Her boyfriend Jeff (Jonathan Tucker) is intense and driven. He views this excursion as a chance to learn something. A prey-med student, he naturally assumes the role as the group's leader when their expedition starts unraveling. As the bizarre truth about these ruins unfolds, his medical training is pushed beyond its limitations in spectacularly grotesque fashion.Throughout, there is the requisite nude scene, the all-night drinking binge before the trip, the absurd stretches in plausibility (how does Amy outrun a village of native Mayans over two miles of jungle?).The acting, particularly Ramsey, is solid. Smith appears to have a firm grasp on how he wants his story played out. His actors show restraint in what could have easily been an orgy of over-the-top hysteria.But of course, we all know who the star is. The scenes on top of the Mayan ruins are graphic and bloody, a ringing ten on the disgust-o-meter. Truly splashy gore, they almost make it worth the price of admission.Had the ending been even marginally creative, we might even be discussing ""The Ruins"" as top-of-the-line horror fare, instead of the straight-to-DVD turkey that it is destined to become.But why quibble.

I was almost opposed to seeing the movie after i saw the TERRIBLE Shutter a week earlier but i was glad i saw it. The scenes were intense, grueling and eye catching. You can't keep your eyes off the screen. Like when Stacy goes absolutely insane and starts cutting herself open to get the vines out and when Jeff decides that they need to cut off Mathias's legs- truly eye catching and horrifying. I loved this movie- i thought it was shot really sick (meaning awesome) and i deff am going to buy it right when it comes out.",The Ruins
281,joannie575,Horrible,2,14 September 2008,"It had potential...it really did. But there is so much about the movie that was ridiculous and laughable. I'm a horror movie weenie and I thought it was stupid; as did my 13-year old! I was expecting to be at least creeped-out. And, yes, the gross-factor of the vines squirming in the people was there; however, the lead-up to getting to the ruins is just dumb, dumb, dumb.I mean really who goes on a hike...in a jungle... with a total stranger... with a little water and a few snacks...IN FLIP FLOPS, NO LESS?! Puh-lease! Better still who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or being able to speak a bit of the language? Are these people complete morons?The German's brother isn't heard from and he doesn't call for assistance? Who doesn't do that? He just finds some Greeks and Americans to go on a little search and find?",The Ruins
282,braindead-and-happy,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie,8,6 July 2008,"This movie is fairly original which is good. With all the boring, cheesy and downright bad horror movies that have been released lately, this movie was a breath of fresh air. It was a nice change from all the sequels/prequels that have been coming out. It had good horror elements which didn't draw on typical monsters, serial killers or chainsaw wielding maniacs. It didn't have the pointless sex scenes and It drew on peoples states of mind and not just hack and slash violence. This is definitely not for people seeking mindless entertainment as it takes more to appreciate this great achievement of a movie. 8/10",The Ruins
283,gbojar,Don't believe the hype!!!!!,3,13 April 2008,"Hey, let's all go deep into the Mexican jungle for fun with a German guy we just met whose brother is there but no one has heard from him since he went. That's no reason for concern first of all. Now let's get there and get trapped on an ancient temple by fairly well dressed natives who speak a non-existent language (when they do speak) but then let's run up hill really really really slow after they shoot the German guy's friend. Oh wait, this is just the beginning. Now we are amidst weeds that LAUGH LIKE CHILDREN, HISS LIKE SNAKES, AND RING LIKE CELL PHONES!!! I also have to agree with another user about the fact that there is no character development so the ""actors"" come off as very one dimensional. And what was up with the ""you slept with my man ... blah, blah, blah"" then all of the sudden it is though the incident never happened. Almost like the ending of the movie leaving you with a feeling of ... ""What just happened?"" I gave it a 3 because of the gore factor, but even much of that was way over done and not really necessary. Since when do gaping wounds just stop bleeding without stitches? Stacy (Laura Ramsey) cuts half her right thigh off with a dull hunting knife and barely bleeds! Come on. This could have been much better had they developed the characters more and cut out the cheesy sound effects. I do not recommend this movie unless you are a fan of evil plants that laugh, hiss, and ring, then you might like it.",The Ruins
284,John-H-S,What the hell?,1,19 July 2008,"I've seen my share of bad horror movies, but this one really tops the list. This plot would be crappy, even for a 'B' movie! The thing is, that when horror movies are this stupid, it turns out to be funny... But this didn't even manage to be funny! So the story is, that a bunch of students has traveled to Mexico for their vacation, where they meet this German fellow, who knows about some forgotten temple of the Aztecs, or the Mayans... But look out you guys, this temple is haunted, or cursed or something like that. So some people from an ancient tribe shows up, to keep the students on the temple, and now they are trapped... Now you're probably thinking: ""HEY!... That doesn't sound THAT boring...."" But wait, I am of course saving the best 'till last... This temple is haunted by nothing less than a plant. An evil plant, with the ability to copy sounds, like a ringing phone, and of course the ability to eat humans...Now if you by now are thinking that the plot sounds scary, and you want to see it, then by all means do it, but I'm just angry that I didn't know what the hell this was... The summary says ""BLAH BLAH BLAH Ruins haunted by something evil...."" Here's a quick biology lesson: Plants can't be evil!! So just a little reminder: Many thing in this world, and also not present in this world are scary... But one thing has been made perfectly clear to me now, plants just aren't!!",The Ruins
285,Moffmalthus,Started off okay until the plot fell off a cliff halfway through,2,16 July 2008,"The Ruins starts off with four young adults on vacation in Mexico were a chance encounter with a German tourist leads them to a mysterious Ruin. While the set up for the flick was okay once the group arrives at the ruin the movie quickly falls apart and becomes just plain silly. I was mildly interested to see what ancient evil force occupied the ruin and was shocked (not in a good way) to learn in was a giant ivy like growth that if touched would infect the body, eventually killing the hapless victim. At one point one of the female cast members encounters a flower chirping like a cell phone in an attempt to lure her into a trap. Clearly it was an attempt by the filmmakers at a ""scary"" moment which left me in tears from laughing so hard. The characters spend the entire time on the ruin waiting for help and make no attempt at all at trying to destroy or combat the ""evil"" plant. It seems so ridiculous on so many levels and in the end I was left hoping this film found its own way to a ruin were it will hopefully be forgotten for all time.",The Ruins

The plant can copy your voice, ridiculous, it can move a heavy human body, it can eat flesh faster then any animal, and it can grow anywhere, even within your body.This is ..... man. Worst end of the movie. The only girl, who made to escape, has that plant within her body, without any wound on her body. Later, friends of a person, died in the ruins,come laughing and smiling, like their friend is having a date with her girlfriend on the ruins with no response for the 4 days.

I found myself itching (pardon the pun) to find our tube of Calamine Lotion during this film.Other than being really impressed with how well they pulled off the special effects regarding severed limbs, etc., I was so not impressed with this film. From the bogus German accent of Mathias, to the very bad acting, to the pitiful vining 'villian,' this film stank.Frankly, the special features were more entertaining than the feature. I have not read the book, but after viewing the movie I am almost afraid to do so. I think that it would've definitely have helped the story a bit to have had an 'insider' explain to the characters what had happened there, what the beliefs of the natives were in regard to this place, the vines, etc. Since it ended the way it did, I am assuming there might be a sequel. I shudder at the suggestion.",The Ruins
289,BeachSPVB187,almost give the book justice,10,6 April 2008,"Dayum what a good movie!Going in I was pretty hesitant because I had already read the book and was excited when I saw the movie coming out. But at the same time I knew that most books fail on screen but The Ruins definitely holds its own! Differing from the book in many key plot points, the movie managed to keep me on my toes and unsurprisingly (you'll get it when you see it) this was the first movie ever to make me look away from the screen because it was so intense. I'm a huge horror movie buff and so is my friend and that was the first movie to ever make us look away because the images that were thrown at us were so disturbing. And trust me, we lasted aight through the Saw's and Hostel. This movie reminded me of a cross between The Descent and Turistas. It reminded me of The Descent because they were trapped with death surrounding them on all sides and Turistas just because the whole American tourists on a vacation gone awry.What this film did best though, like the book, was really show the emotional struggles of the characters. It really did not focus on the vine so much as how the characters were corrupted (not necessary in a bad way) themselves and would be their own demise. I mean, they were good people who couldn't handle being in a situation like that, I don't think anyone could handle it and the film really showed the psychological struggle of attempting to survive a deathtrap like the movie. It was damn good and I can't wait to see it again!Kudos for really showing the characters as they were portrayed in the book! Points off for rushing the scenario, could have made it longer!Overall, a fantastic film. 9/10!",The Ruins
290,melovemax,Waste of time and money,3,24 June 2008,"It started off quite promising but ended up being a very disappointing film. The only good parts in it was where the one guy gets shot with an arrow then has his face blown off.... when the other guy get his legs chopped off by the med student (the graphics are pretty good) and the last 10 minutes of the film when one of the females starts cutting herself open to try and remove the vines? (or whatever that plant was) that were growing inside her.Then they (the only 2 left alive)actually try(for the first time in the film to get away(they were being held in the ruins by local people, the reason is unknown until toward the end of the film)We are not told what exactly is going on, what the plants are and how they got there. We are left with a single escapee who, by the time she gets away, is riddled with whatever it was that seemed to enjoy eating human flesh.

291,pinkpeach47,I was pleasantly surprised...,6,4 April 2008,"I am definitely a fan of the horror genre, but over the past couple of decade these types of films have sort of become laughable. I'm not saying that by any means this film is a masterpiece of the genre, but I did walk out of the theater pleasantly surprised and satisfied.The story is about a group of course young white kids who decide to go on a little adventure to an ancient Mayan temple, ""off the beaten path,"" as Jonothan Tucker's character Jeffery proclaims. As an audience member I'm sort of sitting there thinking that this is possibly the most overly used cliché, having a bunch of stupid kids doing something that most of them know is a stupid idea anyway. A German tourist who leads the group is actually looking for his brother and this is where the movie begins to get interesting.I won't give much away, but its obvious from the trailers that the ruins are invested with killer plants and weeds. The idea initially seemed sort of like a modern riff on Little Shop of Horrors, but the result of this film is actually quite thrilling and even scary at times.I would say that the most intriguing aspect of the film was how the characters relate to each other when the situation takes its turn for the worst. There is obviously a lot of infighting and struggle over leadership and emotions.I thought the film was decently acted with the standout performance being Laura Ramsey. She brought the most chilling aspects to the film.Overall, I enjoyed this film. I didn't jump at any moment in the film, which is usually how I gage whether something is scary or not, but there where a few moments that made me uncomfortable, but in a good way. There also aren't a lot of answers given as to what the killer plant were all about, which I liked because it adds to the mystery. This film was a fun ride and I recommend it, but I don't recommend that they make a sequel or if they do, do it well.",The Ruins
292,skabrina,another excuse for Americans to drink and panic on a vacation,4,6 April 2008,"When watching the previews, and the commercials on TV, I honestly thought this movie was going to be slightly different than other horror flops.4 Americans go on a vacation to Mexico. You do the math: alcohol + European mingling + an unexplored region of Mexico = a disaster written all over it.An excuse for a sex remark at times, and constant complaining coming from an ignorant blonde.When the audience laughs more than they are scared, there's something wrong, and when you laugh during a crying scene, then you know the movie sucks.Absolutely awful, perhaps the $10 should have been used on Nim's Island or something of that sort, maybe Leatherheads?",The Ruins

I read the book before I watched the movie. It is probably one of the best books I've ever read, and it made me so happy to see that Scott Smith wrote the screen play because I thought it would be directly from the book, maybe skipping a few unnecessary scenes. Imagine how disappointed I was when I was watching this movie, or anyone who read the book before the movie for that matter!In the book Pablo, the Greek near the beginning of the movie, was the one to get his legs cut off. Mathias was supposed to live until the end. (This made me the most angry because Mathias was my favorite character, who is portrayed as a strong surviver. However, I think they picked a good actor to play him. Joe Anderson is an amazing actor.) In conclusion, I'd recommend the book before the movie in a heartbeat. They are completely different. So either way, there are a few surprises!",The Ruins

But what I underestimated about this movie when going to see it was the Psychological fear that it created within my body. Unlike most movies, this movie makes you feel like you are trapped with the characters in the ruins. You literally feel their pain. It's got a great story line as well, with a realistic beginning, a gruesome (in a good way) 2nd part. And a fearful ending. I highly recommend this movie to any lover of horror and slasher. The Camera work is brilliant, and the actors have been directed perfectly. This movie gives the book justice, and is one of the few movies that I can honestly say that I enjoyed just as much as the book. I would warn you though that if you have a soft stomach not to see this movie, as in several occasions this movie goes all out on effects. I was also surprised about how well the director was able to make daylight scary. In the end, I would give the Ruins a 7 out of ten.",The Ruins

Well, you tell me: Would you move your legless friend somewhere else to spend the night? OK OK, I'm drifting away. This movie was actually pretty good. Not very smart, but entertaining, funny and somehow interesting. You get involved, trying to figure out how you can escape from this freaking location.

My family watches movies that we don't want to waste money on, but might be interesting, when it comes out on pay-per-view because it is so much cheaper and you can watch it again if there are any twists. So basically there are some skin scenes for the can't get laid audience, but despite that it was great. The characters are typical tourists. Survival tip #1: if the locals avoid someplace something must be wrong. Anyway it had a 'it could happen to me' type feel. I love horror movies and this movie actually scared me. It had blood and gore but it wasn't some over the top 50 gallons of fake blood type of movie. The suspense was done perfectly it had me at the edge of my seat.

I personally prefer to see the horror movies which do have some stories,so that it keeps diverting attention from horror. Though most of the actors are new,they acted well. Screenplay is also good. If you have around 120 mins of free time and you don't know what to do,then I will recommend you to watch this movie.Don't keep high expectations. It's a typical horror movie like the rest.

Since they had fire..why didn't they try to burn the plants? Also when they first lowered the German guy down (can't remember his name) to get the cell phone the rope was broke like half way to the bottom of the pit. But later when the girls went down to get the phone some how the rope grew much longer. The ending was left open for a sequel I guess. It wasn't a bad movie. It had some scary parts that made me jump. The acting could have been a little better. I believe this was a book first. I would assume that the book would be much better then the movie as most books are.,The Ruins
304,ughmazing,The best horror film of the new century.,10,4 April 2008,"Warning: Many, many spoilers in this review. Do not read if you don't want to be spoiled.The Ruins is a disturbing, terrifying, and well-acted horror film. It's the best horror film of the new century, and it's truly an original piece of cinema that achieves the status of an instant classic.The opening scenes at the hotel were done well-enough, it established most of their personalities, and I immediately loved Stacy. It was kind of odd how they introduced Mathias, but it worked. After they go to bed, and Amy makes her failed pass at Mathias, the movie picks right up. Oh, on the nudity front: Laura Ramsey? You see everything. Not that I'm complaining, hehe. It's brief, she takes off a towel and puts on a shirt and underwear. On the Jonathan Tucker front, that seems to have become a hot topic on here: it's extremely brief, you see like.. half his ass through the clear shower curtain. Woopie.When they finally arrive at The Ruins, and are confronted by the Mayan's, let me say one thing: intense. It was done extremely well, you were on the edge of your seat wondering what was going to happen (even though I knew, lol). When the killing of Dimitri finally happened, several people screamed. It was very sudden, and very brutal. Once on the top of the ruins, all hell breaks loose.My favourite scene hands down would have to be the ""PULL US UP!' scene. It was done so effectively it's insane. It was extremely intense, and when the audience finally realized what was going on, there were gasps everywhere. The CGI plant mimicking the cell phone ring looked great, and when the vines were going crazy, it looked very realistic.The psychological aspect of the film was perfection. It really got in your head, and just.. wow. I still can't stop my head from spinning. The most effective part of the movie may by Stacy's fall. She starts off as this sweet, happy, optimistic girl who wants to have a good time. By the time the half-way point rolls around, she's just completely drained and deteriorated. I felt so bad for her, I just wanted to hug her, lol.The acting was top-of-the-line. Laura Ramsey shined, she was amazing. I swear I felt like crying when she was begging Amy to kill her, and when it happens, its thankfully off-screen. The vines begin mimicking her voice, ""kill me, kill me"" until Jeff finally does, and the camera cuts to the Mayan's down below the temple: silence. Some things are better off unseen, it was much more effective. But don't worry: very few times does the camera cut away. OH, before I forget: Mathias' death was extremely well-done. Very, very creepy. Anyways, the rest of the cast did a good job as well. Amy has hella-annoying at the beginning, and I didn't really feel she ""redeemed"" herself like some people said, but you wanted her to live at the end, for she had gone through so much. Seeing all her best friends die, watching her boyfriend sacrifice himself so she could escape. But the ending was still somewhat of a letdown. It was typical, and not original like the ending of the novel. Oh, well: the original ending will probably be on the DVD.When all was said and done, I can't help but say I was disappointed. Not with the quality of the film, it was fantastic. But that it was over. I had waited for this film for so long, and now it's just.. done. But I still feel great, because it was very well done. I highly recommend it to all horror fans, because even with the cliché ending, the rest of the movie is one of the most original, terrifying, and thought-provoking horror films in the past.. century.

It definitely belongs on a triple bill of high camp with Day Of The Triffids and Little Shop of Horrors.

I found this to be an incredibly average depiction of the events in the novel. I can say the acting is good and the gory effects are quite chilling. For some reason there just isn't the same level of panic and dread that slowly crept up on me when reading the book. There were some issues with cheesy dialogue and I felt that more could have been done to develop the characters before they end up on the ruins. Definitely a solid horror flick, but not a classic.

As an avid horror movie buff I feel this was a masterpiece. Filmed on location and actually in raw sunlight as opposed to most movies in this genre that use darkness to hide the lousy monsters or violent and hideous scenes. My four year old daughter found the leg amputations most educational and I believe she will be soon be trying out the methods shown on her grandmother. It was nice that my great aunt Maude brought some of her famous hashish brownies and of course Uncle Elmo would use his ever popular fart machine at the perfect moments. The cast was superb and very easy on the eyes. It was a bit disappointing that they seemed persistent at cutting off parts of their anatomies so eventually they were not that splendid to look at and the blonds attempt in loosing weight might have be a good diet opposed to removing the cellulite from her thighs with a small hunting knife.

309,flashgerling,Another pile of crap from cheap Hollywood,4,14 April 2008,"This is one of the all-around worst movies I have ever seen in the theater. All ""The Ruins"" proved to be was several re-hashed ideas from other bad horror movies over the last decade.Without giving much of the story away, imagine a 90 minute play combining Cabin Fever, Touristas, and Hostel where there is only about 4 pages of scripted dialog, no opportunity for the audience to connect with the characters, and no good resolution in the end.This kind of film has become a disturbing trend in the industry and has unfortunately led the horror genre into more of a ""shock horror"" line of crap designed to gross out the viewer. Little attention is paid to the story, characters, or even direction. The goal is strictly to use special effects to make the audience squirm in their seat. While one scene did accomplish this, it came well short of making the experience worth while.I was warned about the quality of this film before I bought the ticket, but I didn't listen.

310,darkangel6266,"Read the book, kind of impressed",8,18 July 2010,"i think they did a pretty good job of following the story line. i can understand why they switched some of the people around and why they killed off the Greek at first- it just doesn't translate as well in a movie. a stranger they just met and couldn't speak to would have made it less intimate. i think they should have kept the Stacy Mathias thing rather than making it Amy Mathias. Stacey was facing the identity crisis in the book. it was just a weird change. also the Eric leg cut. it would have made more sense to stick to the original plot a little more closely the only thing i was disappointed with was how superficial they made it. like the characters are REALLY intense in the book, and you can just get a really good picture of how emotional and intense it was. there were parts of the book where i felt like crying and i was really scared for them. i even felt totally hopeless. it was one of the books that just grab you and leave you with the idea long after you've finished. the movie, however, seemed more like a bunch of spoiled whiny college kids who got everyone else into trouble. i didn't feel quite as bad for them. i get the fact that the flashbacks and thoughts are very difficult to translate in a movie, but i was kind of expecting a little more. however, despite all of this, i think it was a genuinely good movie. it was entertaining, and pretty suspenseful. i went out and bought it. it's not a classic, but it's a good movie to enjoy late at night.",The Ruins

I had heard and read that it was a pretty decent movie, but since they didn't do a big media package with a lot of previews, I was concerned it would leave me asking why I wasted to hours.That being said, I was pretty impressed. It's a horror movie, not much is to be expected from the genre. This movies had some balls though. They had the balls to put out an R rated title. Most horror movies now fall under the PG-13 column so they can make more money. There was also some very gruesome scenes that left me shaken at some points.All in all, not a bad movies, it had balls and to any horror film wanting to go to the movies this weekend, I would bet the farm this kicks the crap out of the Prom Night slasher film.",The Ruins

All said and done, The Ruins is at best a 'also seen' kind of Movie. I saw it because I got a cheap DVD, however to be fair to the movie- it does excite once in a while. The suspense element is somehow very tame and the secret of the ruins remains till the end and the movie ends without solving the mystery. May be the Director and the film team never wanted to solve the mystery and leave room for a sequel. I hope that is happens for the good potential of the plot.on the whole- would give it a 5/10 for the chill factor and especially mention the one good scene inside the chamber where the flowers imitate the cell phone beeps. that was creepy. The CG is good and the plot is fabulous, but somewhere along the way, the film lost it.

Although I thought the book was overrated it was entertaining and kept me interested. The same could not be said for the movie as it doesn't follow the book in the slightest. There are character changes for everything important that happens at the beginning of the movie. Pablo is the one who is supposed to break his back, Erik is the one who jumps down and cuts open his leg etc. So although I didn't finish watching it, what crap I did see was a complete mockery of the book.",The Ruins

Well, I've been more careful.From the trailers and the print ads, I didn't have much hope for The Ruins, which left me with certain impressions of cookie-cutter CGI, gore, pacing, etc. A friend insisted I see it, and I went along.Good news. The gore is creative and well-shot to accentuate it, the grisly scenes are, well, cringe-worthy, and I'm not easily affected by on-screen gore. The CGI is largely creative, and off to the corner of the screen, accentuating the scene without distracting, most of the time. The actions of most of the characters are reasonable. The assumption of the kids being 'archaeologists' is thankfully false, they're just vacationing (not really a spoiler.) Overall, it was paced rather well, the effects were welcome and creative, the 'shock' factor was high and repeatedly effective, and the performances were neither thin, nor over-the-top.Great horror/date flick, if on the gory side.It looks like horror movies that take their time with their script, casting, and effects departments are making a comeback (hopefully.) I would suggest you see this in the theater.If not, I would highly suggest a rental.This is no typical teeny-slasher flick that's overdone, this movie is a rather refined horror feature. :)",The Ruins

Everything down to the Ruin itself is immaculately beautiful as well as the environment during the movie. There is some comic relief in the movie but to be honest I was rather too nervous to even laugh.Finally a movie that's not a remake of a Chinese horror movie and it has to be the best movie I have seen this year.

It absolutely has no logic, no horror- doesn't scare you, no suspense, not thrilling.. I mean I didn't find even one part of the movie appealing..I don't know what they were thinking when they made the movie.. You watch the whole movie to find out that, there is a plant that can walk around, drag human dead bodies and eat human flesh. Not just that but it can also talk i.e. imitate sounds, like a cellphone ringing or human talking... so its like, the plant makes the noise of a cell phone ringing, so they go after the cellphone and find out its a plant... how intelligent of the plant to setup an ambush.

322,achimpanzee,"The only thing in ""ruins"" is this film",2,25 April 2008,"What makes a ""bad"" film? I will never say ""don't see this film"" because that limits your creative comparisons to others in the industry. The rating you see above (6.5 during this writing) is the most inaccurate rating I have seen on IMDb. The Ruins is simply NOT a good film in any way shape or form.I have never been so extremely disappointed in a movie that seemingly had such potential as this. If I had a choice between seeing this again or Wicker Park (which I always reference as the worst movie ever). Even the nudity (yes, I am a male) was still unnecessary and just pointless. In fact the idea that I'm even reviewing it makes me angry!So anyway here is a very broken down review of the movie. I am not going to go over the synopsis there are plenty of well written summaries already here.Biggest Problem of All: Before you get to the details - there is about 2 minutes of the film actually IN the ruins. That's it. The rest is on TOP of the ruins. At the one-hour mark (which is after the last you see of the inside) I thought ""holy crap"". Astonished, bewildered and just plain depressed I continued to waste another 40 minutes of my life.Acting: Pretty good acting especially the female cast. Kudos to them on working with a horrible script.Plot: The ""idea"" of the film is a great setup. People interacting with a cursed ruins; not completely original but it peaked my interest. However, the writing was 0/10. I cannot emphasize this enough - the writing of this movie, as well as the direction, is some of the worst I have ever experienced (and I have spent years of my life watching countless movies good and bad). Please be aware I have not read Scott B. Smith's novel this is associated with, but if this movie is anywhere along the lines of the book then Scott Smith should be banned from the silver screen ever again. The reason is primarily inconsistencies, lack of climax, and extremely horrible ""resolution"" to the film.Character Development: Absolutely none. Even afterwards I don't know crap about who anyone is, nor do I care. You can't identify with anyone, and you don't even remember their names afterwards. Just plain bad!Musical Score: This is easy - there is none. Oh sure there is a cello here and a few drums there. But just listen during most of the film...silence. Music is what drives human emotion, it has been a part of civilization since the dawn of mankind. Why remove that from films? No idea. Ask Carter Smith and whoever else is responsible.Plethora of flaws: To make this short here are the major flaws I found in this film which is what destroyed its ability to ever be considered a decent film (please revisit after viewing): When their friend is shot in the first 20 min of the film nobody seems to care. They scream for about 10 seconds and then act as if it was 10 years ago. The girls shed a tear or two but the guys seem to say ""oh well"".  The ""doctor"" of the group knows all about infections, yet he doesn't give instruction to his friends who pick up the Greek with the broken back 3 feet off the ground by his legs/torso. I mean seriously?  Who goes to an ancient ""Mayan"" ruin without flashlights, radio's (non cell-phones dummies), water supplies, food and proper gear. I have never been to such a place but you better be sure I would at least have a flashlight and some batteries!  If I were a girl and I was sleeping on top of some ruins after my friend died and another man was paralyzed, I wouldn't sleep in my panties. There are all kinds of strange men with weapons around you - why would you want to sleep in next to nothing?  Apparently there is only one side to the ruins since there were about 15 guys out there, but no sign of anything on the other side. Guess production costs were too high and they couldn't construct a fully 3 dimensional prop.  Quote: ""Four Americans just don't' disappear"". Yes, I too am American, yet I would never even concoct that phrase in my head in time of crisis.  So they cut of a guys legs to ""save"" him, but then in the next scene he is laying there, with open wounds, while dust blows into what remains. Real smart Doc.  The horrible one liner ""Well at least we cut his legs off"" about 1 min. after the guy dies. Sigh...  So the guy that is paralyzed from the waist down gets a bit to bite down on while they cut off his legs, yet the girl they cut open with a knife just sits there watching and eventually screaming while the ""doctor"" sticks his dirty fingers into her wounds. Yea that makes sense.Ending: Very ""slapped together"" as if they cut it down after-the-fact just to rush production. 'Nuff said.In conclusion: see this film but only over a friends' house that treats you to the rental fee. I would still suggest you see something that actually makes your heart rate raise even 1 BPM over your resting rate. At least then you'll be 1 more above what I was during this film. I could go on for another 10 pages but if anyone is still reading this they either have a lot of patience or agree with me. If you agree with me, I am sorry to hear you wasted your time on the film as well.",The Ruins
323,kianlaw,Don't waste your time on this movie !,1,16 August 2008,"Do yourself a favor and read the book instead. A disgraceful adaptation of a brilliant book. The plot was changed without any obvious reason except maybe to please the American market by showing the audience that Americans are superior and stronger than stupid Europeans who should be shot right at the beginning of the movie. Maybe that's why one of them even survives by the end even though the book has totally different ending. Some may say that I'm dissing the movie solely because it doesn't follow the book closely. You are maybe right but that is only one among lot of things that is wrong about this movie. The characters have no depth and no real connection with each other at all. Amy and Stacy are supposed to be best friends for years but they are as strangers to each other as the German guy who've they just met. I did not care for one single character in this movie because they are portrayed too shallow to care about. All the gore and blood is there as a lame attempt to shock the audience but it takes more than just the buckets of blood and cutting knife to actually shock the audience. How about some real character emotions that serve as a foundation for all the gore and horror that comes later. I honestly have no idea what was director thinking while making this movie. Except maybe that Dimitri is more suitable Greek name then Pablo. In one word, terrible, terrible movie, even on its own without any book comparison. If you haven't read the book and you wanna see below average summer attempt to shock you, you may as well watch the movie. But you should be better of watching some decent horror movie instead. And if you read the book and you liked it, then don't put yourself through the misery and pain of actually watching this. Keep the memory of the book untainted.",The Ruins

The acting was awful, the storyline was similar to many ""horror"" movies of late, and the worst part of all was the plants. There are these plants that eat people, and just wait until visitors come and eat them. This is so illogical because A) people who have gone missing numerous times would lead to some sort of a search, and B) how would this massive plant survive for years between meals. It just made no sense, the story was extremely boring, and there was absolutely nothing enjoyable about this movie. It did serve some comic relief, however not intentionally.

326,Danthewiseman,How did it get such a great rating?,5,6 April 2008,"---Spoiler Safe Zone--- I considered marking my vote a 1 just to bring down the current rating but I decided to give it what I believe it should have (5). The acting isn't terrible and characters react in the way you would imagine them to. However, just like all horror movies they still make stupid moves that have to be made to keep the movie interesting. Not to mention it has a crappy ending. There were about two scenes that made me cringe a little but that's about as good as it got. In my opinion it should have only been 30 min long. I think the girl I was with jumped once. But, to tell you why it's a 5 I have to spoil the movie for you.---Spoiler Zone Bellow--- The reason why it's a 5 is because the plant growing on the ruins is the enemy and it doesn't even really eat them. It just kind of tries to get itself inside you which makes for one of the good (but short) scenes. Other than that it just drags away dead bodies because it's too weak to drag away living ones. It also mimics cell phones and other noises. So... Why don't they just run away from the plant? It's not because they are stuck in the ruins. In fact they are camping on top of them. It's because a tribe of people won't let them leave because they don't want the plant to spread. They just shoot people that try to escape. No cool deaths that way.",The Ruins

But during the first 10 minutes of the movie it captivated me. I WAS PRACTICALLY STUCK TO MY COUCH!!! Not only was the movie good all the way through it was a really unique plot and the killers were not who you would think they would be...those evil little plants!!! The screenwriter did a wonderful job making up the characters and he made the audience feel like we were the characters. He also made us feel sorry for the characters if something bad happened to them or they died (and trust me...a lot of people die in this movie) And my most favorite thing I like about this movie is that its not about the gore and blood but it has gore and blood when it needs to. I mean, other horror movies now days just overdue the blood and make it unnecessary, but this movie did a really good job in handling the blood and gore. Although it might have been unbearable to watch sometimes, it still hit you at the spot to why they showed it. And last but not least, the ending!!! OMG!!! The ending was awesome!!! The lone survivor drives away in the car thinking that she got away from the nightmare that had conquered all her friends and her boyfriend and then suddenly she realizes that the vine (which is the killer in the movie and it kills it victims by growing inside of them and other wonderfully unique ways like choking them, making them turn on each other, etc. THEY ARE REALLY DEVIOUS PLANTS) is growing inside of her!!! BLACKOUT!!! Then we see two men wandering into the Mayan temple where our main characters at the beginning were at and met their doom and then BLACKOUT. It leaves you satisfied and it also leaves you hanging in some way thinking if the two men went through the Mayans temple like our main characters did or did they just go back when the villagers told them to leave.

Granted, I can just about accept that it falls in the 'so bad it's almost good' category; possibly worthy or a night in with your mates a few beers and laughing and jeering at the screen. But let's break this down: this movie has a truly terrible and totally predictable plot, nonsensical character actions and motivations, periodically laughable acting and pedestrian directing. It is neither tense nor scary; you neither care for any of the characters (and in fact because they seem to have a death wish by performing the worst decision-making in movie history, you actually hope they do die. And quickly.) , it is bad bad bad bad. And I don't mean 'bad' in the 80's sense of the word, meaning 'good'. It stinks. Pure and simple.

The movie was different, though, but in a good way. Scott Smith, who wrote the book, also wrote the screenplay so he really knew what he was doing. I enjoyed how he switched up the book and the screenplay. In the book, certain things happens to certain characters. In the movie, he totally changed everything with the characters and it worked really well for the movie, and also gave those who have read the book a different way of seeing it. If you've read the book and seen the movie, then you'll know how much faster everything seems to happen on the screen (obviously). The book is very drawn out with details and what the characters are thinking. The acting in the movie was really great, too. The main characters consist of Jonathan Tucker (Jeff), Jena Malone (Amy), Shawn Ashmore (Eric), Laura Ramsey (Stacy), and Joe Anderson (Mathias). Laura Ramsey especially stood out to me in this movie. She really made you think that was actually happening to her.

Smith from his own novel of the same name.It has some moments that truly are novel - it does mix the standard trope of psychological horror with gore but the way the screenplay proceeds doesn't feel exploitative or cheap. The acting is decent and the characters don't make stupid decisions like in most horror movies.Overall, I felt this movie is really underrated (I hadn't heard or read about it) and is a good watch on a dull day.",The Ruins
340,kyledavisonline,A welcomed spin on an otherwise stereotypical story,3,27 August 2017,"The overall story-arc is your stereotypical mad-mad in the woods thriller. The plot contains various reference to the typical style we've come to love and hate in horror films. However, this movie places a nice twist on the sub-plot. Whiles the teens are up to something they should not be, the monster in the dark isn't quite what you except. We don't see a mad bunch of hillbillies, or creatures with no origin. It stays clear of a supernatural entity or a more basic mad man of the seventies era. We instead, see Mother Nature take her seeds within the story and character. A welcomed change. If you're looking for a good, suspenseful horror, then I would strongly advise looking elsewhere. The horror is scares to say the least. You would find more fright in a Scooby-Doo movie and more suspense in their long running TV shows, then in any part of this film. I found myself firmly planted back in my seat, and never coming to the edge of my chair. The films need it pass on moments where they could play to the suspense, leaves the viewer feeling cheated and unsurprised at the ending.The gore within this film is brief and used mainly to further develop the story arc. The scenes are plentiful in blood and certainly make feel the need to glance away from your screens. While the amputation scene leaves much to be desired, the film more than make up for it with one of the female leads slow battle with insanity and downward spiral into cutting herself. The sexual conduct of this film is split on me. While I enjoyed the placement of nudity and welcomed the change of not having to see every female nude, for god only knows what reason. This film places a brief nude scene, while implying sexual conduct. Having said that, there is one scene that raises more questions that answered, as a female leads, give a hand job to her surprised boyfriend, following events that make you question why? It severed no purpose to the story, nor showed nothing more than a hand below the sheets, and even came following character deaths. Overall, the writing felt bland, but at points creative. The characters where un-relatable and forgettable. If felt very much like a small budget indy film, and left the viewer wondering just what it all meant. With little playing to its intended genre, I would strongly advise watching, only as a last resort.",The Ruins
341,juri-wunder,Sh*tt* acting 'ruins' a descent movie,5,30 June 2008,"Okay first of all i can't get it why this movie has a rating over 5...I liked the idea of the 'monster', which is pretty original in my opinion and i really liked the scenery, camera-work and special effects. The temple ruin is pretty impressive and the gore scenes are exquisitely done.The story is also very intriguing. You are left in the dark for some time and ask yourself 'Hey what's wrong with those nice temple ruins?'. So all in all it's a good start for a nice, not very demanding horror flick.BUT: Who the hell thought up the crappy dialogs, told the two ladies to wince around ALL THE TIME!? Especially Laura Ramsey got on my nerves after 15 minutes and i was begging 'Please let her die first!'.I mean sure they are in a really, really bad situation but at some time you should calm yourself down for the sake of the group and don't worry about who exchanged body fluids with whom! The only one who shone through all the dirt was Jonathan Tucker. But his descent acting drifted into an absurd calmness because the two girls were running around screaming all the time.Also there are some logic mistakes in the movie for instance why does Heinrich have a bullet hole in his head and arrows sticking out of him if the villagers never step foot on the temple??? Or why is the rope too short at first and then its so long that the girls can easily get to the ground? And like always i found it ridiculous that a native English speaking person (Joe Anderson) tries to imitate a German. Come on guys our actors aren't THAT expensive...",The Ruins
342,diaz987,I loved it,7,26 February 2017,"I loved this movie, even if the actors are not always convincing. The only downside for me is that there is no explanation to explain to us why the ruins are cursed. It would have been nice at the end to tell us why the ruins are in this state. Finally, I did not much like the ending. There are two purposes and I find the second much more convincing.",The Ruins
343,Jester28,what a complete waste of time & RIP-OFF!,2,7 April 2008,"I knew that this movie would be a complete disappointment. I was reluctant to see it because I assumed that it was going to be just like the other generic horror movies. It had a WEAK PLOT, cheesy characters, and lame dialogue. If you saw Hostel or any of the Saw movies, then do NOT waste your time! This movie is similar to the previously mentioned, but NOT more gory than this movie and actually quite a disappointment. I would relate this movie very closely with TURISTAS. I think that the characters' deaths were G-rated. The only positive thing I have to say is that the actors did well for the lame script that they had to work with. If you gave ""The Ruins"" anything higher than a 5 then please do not rate this movie because it belongs in the IMDb BOTTOM 100!!",The Ruins
344,acbmusicx,"If you like gore, and grotesque scares...",7,7 April 2008,"Then this for you. I went into this movie with fairly high expectations because of how well done the novel was, and I wasn't disappointed. Let me start off by saying that if you don't like blood and gore, you should stay away from this film. There are multiple moments that made me cringe, and the gore was super realistic so stay away if you have a weak stomach.The screenplay was well done, but I questioned why a screenwriter would take so many liberties with his own book. Everything from the ending, to a couple of the characters names were changed. Don't expect to see the novel transported on screen. That said I think it was still well done. The dialog is a little thin at times, mostly the beginning, and the characters actions are questionable at times. That said, it is mostly believable. The acting was average, but more than sufficient for an American horror film. In fact it was leagues better than a lot of the horror trash we've seen lately.The special FX were very good. One of my main concerns was that the plant would look cheesy and not scary, but I was pleasantly surprised by how terrifying and beautiful the plant was. I like how the Mayan temple's atmosphere changed from impressive and beautiful when the college kids arrived, to oppressive and dark as the movie wore on. Bottom line. If you like the book, or like blood, gore or are looking for a casual, beautiful, but still claustrophobic psychological horror movie. Go see it, you won't be disappointed.

I constantly found myself thinking that someone couldn't possibly have pulled off the mix of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""House of 1000 Corpses"" better. I found myself, as well as the other 6 people in the audience laughing at this film, not for its comedic value, but for the fact that someone actually thought this was a movie worth making (which, in itself, is funny enough). I have serious questions about who wasted their money producing it. I guess I can salvage the fact that I only lost $8, and I'm sure they lost a house. Not to worry though! If your curiosity consumes you, yet you cant bring yourself to pay to see it in the theater, it will be in the $5 bin of DVD's at your local Wal-Mart in the next month or so. R.

I thought it was going to be one of those movies where the plot is really predictable. To my surprise, I was sucked into it within the first two gripping minutes. There was gore, but not the kind you see in a lot of movies where it looks really fake. You will cringe and feel the characters pain. There were parts where I wanted to cry, and also parts the made me jump. I did get a bit of a ""Survivor"" feel out of it. The only complaint I have is that I wish it would have had a more explanatory ending. Other than that, it was an excellent movie. Definitely worth the money to go see.",The Ruins

If I wouldn't of read the book then, I would of gave it a 7, buy after reading the book, and then watching the movie, I was really disappointed. Some of the things, that are missing, is that One of the Myan guys, had warned them not to go.

349,robamacaf-1,"Quite a decent ""Horror"" movie",8,6 April 2008,"I went and saw The Ruins on opening day because I heard good things about it. The buzz was pretty spot on. While I wouldn't call this a ""horror"" movie compared to some of the things that come out now and days it is most certainly a thriller.Starting out I thought it was going to be one of the ""same old, same old"". Within 5 minutes of the movie there is already a topless girl. But once the cast heads out to see the Ruins, that is where this separates itself from the other ""teen horror"" flicks.The people in the movie act in a way that a normal person would act. There isn't anyone going into a dark basement by themselves when the power magically goes off and there is a killer on the loose! There wasn't any real point in the movie where I thought, ""What are they thinking!?"" The Ruins does have some of the ""Boo"" type of scares that make you jump a bit but the most horrifying part of the movie is the situation they got into. There is a bit of gore but nothing compared to movies like Saw or Hostel. It seems the gore plays a good role in the movie and it isn't over done.Because I don't want to give much away I won't say that much about the story line besides that there are a group of people who go to see a uncharted ruin in Mexico and that is where the story takes place.

350,JoelHorton_1,The Worst!,1,15 April 2008,"God! Where do I begin? From start to finish, I could not help to hate this movie. Vines? Vines that make cell-phone noises?! Oh yeah, I'm so scared - I'm going to rid the weeds of earth! Come on people! The plot went nowhere, When the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! That whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), sawing off Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots first threw down the rope after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground.

At least Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was intended to be funny. If you like blood and gore, no story line, an absurd script, and loads of money to spend on drivel like this, then more power to you. Then add to it an absurd plot, one of the worst ""scripts"" imaginable and enough blood to fill blood banks for decades.

At first, I thought ""Oh, well maybe it's zombies?"" oh, no, far from it. If you get cut, plants get into your cut, and even when you rip the suckers out, they stay there. They mess with your head because the flowers can imitate cellphone rings and voices. Sounds kinda cool, right? Except it's a stereotypical horror movie. One girl survives, everyone else is killed by the plants. You see it coming. It wasn't scary to me in the least, except at first I thought there was a big spider somewhere.

The movie's flaws are so magnified when you compare them to the richer, and more suspenseful novel on which its based.The movie's tagline should be, ""Young, dumb pretty people get stranded on pyramid and attacked by vine. Usual formulaic horror movie ensues lacking any real sense of suspense or surprise.""Ultimately, everything is rushed in the movie. The movie suffers in part because it cannot display the psychological depth that the book did, which is what made it an effective and suspenseful read. This mostly involved the mistrust between the characters as time wore on and they became concerned about food and water and began fearing for their survival. This could not be effectively conveyed in the film and was further weakened by the events in the movie seeming to unfold so quickly. It was far too rushed. The characters were standard cardboard cutout horror film fodder with zero depth. It was mostly disappointing because the story had the potential to make for a quality horror/suspense movie if executed effectively. It's too bad it wasn't.",The Ruins
354,nj347306,"OK, not a real strong script, and no foreshadowing paid off. Spoilers!!",2,5 April 2008,"There were a lot of things about this movie that bothered me and I didn't like. First of all, in the beginning when it shows that girl in the dark screaming for help, I felt that was foreshadowing the end, somehow, when everyone else was dead and she was the only one left. So when Amy was running to the jeep, I was expecting her to fall in some hole, or something to happen to her and she would be the girl from the beginning, but nothing. She gets in the jeep and drives off. The girl in the beginning didn't really serve any purpose at all.Second, the shot that first shows Mathais at the pool, he is looking over at the four people, like he was watching them. Then her found Amy's ear ring, OK. Then he just invites them to go to these ruins with him. If you were on vacation, and this random guy you don't know came up to you and asked you to go in the middle of nowhere to these ruins, why would you go with him? So the whole time, I was tracking this guy thinking who is he and why is he taking these people out here. But there was nothing, he ends up dying.Third, there wasn't anything about the history of the ruins. There needed to be something about the history of the ruins, why the people were afraid of it. Something else that kind of goes along with this is when they first go down the hole, they pull out these lanterns. I know they had backpacks and stuff, so they could have lanterns with them, but they did show it. If they would have shown getting the first one out, I would have bought showing more.Another thing that really bothered me was when they were cutting off Mathias' legs. When the girls were told to go inside the tent, they should have shown then raising the rocks getting ready to break the bones and cut to a shot of the girls in the tent, trying to cover their ears or something. Because when you don't see something, whatever you can build in your head is so much more intense that anything you can see. Like a scary movie, it is more scary when you don't see the monster, because you can make up the monster in your mind.Another thing, when the blond girl is cutting herself up, and she slices that guys hand. Then her boyfriend goes up and she stabs him. He was kind of asking to be stabbed. If I saw someone just get cut by some girl going crazy, the last thing I would do is go up to the same girl with the knife. You're asking to get cut or stabbed.I also thought the acting was very melodramatic and over the top. Visually, it wasn't that bad. Living plants that eat you would have been really interesting if it was set up better.",The Ruins

I did not like the ending at all. Not sure why everyone said the ending was disturbing. Nothing in the film was enough to make me cringe or turn away.

More intelligent American citizens, and the rest of the world, may take this to mean that this film is just another contradictory, would be pot-boiler, and that your life is not going to be enriched, or even entertained, watching it. The best that can be hoped for is confusion; the combatants are on a Greek holiday(?) yet the action takes place at a ('Ruin'ed) Mayan temple! I may have missed some explanation for this so obvious continent misplacement, but frankly I was fast approaching the losing the will to live syndrome.

When you leave the coastal areas forget about that. It took a while to figure out the premise of the film, and when you finally did, there were too many unanswered questions.I would not recommend you take children to this, not much nudity, but of all the graphic mutilation that takes place.

The acting reminded of something out of a high school play, and the oh-so-over-dramatic lead character Amy just wanted the plant to eat her so she'd shut up. The psycho vine/plant is the scary monster? What? When I saw the previews I was expecting them to actually venture into the ruin...yeah way wrong. The entire film takes place on top of the temple. There were a few scenes that made me not just up and leave the theater. The vines crawling beneath Stacy's skin was actually pretty nasty looking, so props for the visual effects dept. When she starts carving herself up to get all the vines out, that was pretty gruesome, which her ability to pull of that scene was fairly impressive given the crap acting up to that point. There was absolutely no back story to these ruins or the plants...so in short its a demon plant that eats people...k. I suppose that i didn't understand why they didn't just throw the vines and hit all the villagers? Once they saw Mr. Man kill the kid, don't you think that would have been a sign...?

The plot line of the movie has been unsuccessful to catch me off guard, and to make me jump out of my seat, all because of the fact that it is entirely enshrouded with predictability. As for the genre itself, lately I have yet to see a decent one to come out so far. But who knows, a person might come out with one that will in a literal sense to scary the crap out of the audience.

I mean, while the tickets where free, persons should be paid to see the movie... it's that bad! The movie starts out just like any poorly written horror screenplay, with multiple shots of female breasts. To sum up the story line a group of drunken sex hound college students find a uncharted Mayan temple. The temple is covered with man eating marijuana plants that have the capability to mimic sounds somehow through their red flowers. Needless to say all but the annoying chick you actually do want to die, dies. Think of gore of Saw, meets Little Shop of Horrors, meets pure liquefied garbage.During the movie none of the main characters think about how they have access to multiple items that can cause fire and to apply said fire to the burnable man eating weed plants. Despite such a obvious solutions the characters did know advanced medicine, tactics, survival techniques, and human psychology. In this aspect think of Macgyver... except Macgyver has a brain tumor and dementia. The group of college students also are being quarantined by some unknown tribe that somehow has gone undiscovered... yet also has access to modern cloths and guns. Somehow we are also lead to believe that the man eating pot for some magical reason cannot leave the temple it grows on and is stopped by typical table salt placed on the ground.Overall the movie tried to make up for it's horrible plot by using excessive gross gore and allegories to sex. At frequent times during the movie the crowd was laughing at the inconceivableness of the storyline. I also witnessed at least 4 groups of persons getup and leave. I personally thought B movies where a thing of the 40's but evidently I was wrong. At the same time I'm compelled more to call it a C movie instead.

The suspense continues when the Mayans show up and force them to stay at the ruins.Then the movie turns from somewhat suspenseful to pointless. The amount of gore found in this movie did not balance out compared to whether it was truly necessary or used more for shock value.The fact that they didn't make any attempt to fight the vines from hell. They had fire and didn't try to burn it nor did they try to cut it with a knife to see if they could destroy it or not.

I won't spoil things for you by revealing what the menaces were but neither are worth the wait.I have nothing against horror films/gorefests but this doesn't have the same level of threat as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street and it doesn't have humour of Scream.And to think I could have seen Sex and the City...",The Ruins
369,pboorn,Scary?,4,10 May 2008,"I went to see this movie because a friend really wanted to. It started somewhat promising. When the first person died, it was a surprise. It went downhill from there. I never laughed so hard during a so-called ""Horror"" movie in my life!! It was so not scary that it was hilarious! I guess with Ben Stiller as a producer, I should have expected some comedy. The ending was pretty interesting, maybe there will be a Ruins 2, but hopefully it will not be so comical. An elderly couple sat in front of us and were laughing as hard as we were. If you want something that will scare you, save your money. This was no scarier than ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.""

370,iquoteron,Disappointing,4,26 June 2008,"This movie had potential within the first 30 minutes, but than it turned into another pointless Hollywood horror. Maybe it was the lack of funds or maybe it was the lack of imagination of the writers. If they make a 2nd movie they better use their minds and add some backdrop to why those damn plants attacked those tourists and maybe give some insight into the ancient civilization that lived there before, maybe some curse or some evil spirits mutated into those vile things! There was some pretty nasty scenes in that movie and the actors played fairly well, but still i think that its a poor movie. If you do rent or buy this movie, don't expect too much.

Oh yeah, I'm so scared - I'm going to rid the weeds of earth! Come on people! The plot went nowhere, When the group discovered the ruin, and the village people (no pun intended) came to warn them and brandished weapons in front of their faces, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! That whole scene really had me wondering why she didn't take pictures of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), sawing off Mathias (Joe Anderson) legs. When the idiots first threw down the rope after Mathias, how the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it eventually was able to be a mere two to four feet from the ground. I cannot begin to cover everything that was wrong about this movie, there is just too much to cover.

I will say, I really enjoyed the beginning where the first girl was sitting in the middle crying for help, and then she disappeared. That was a good part. I thought ALL the actors/actresses did a GREAT job. But the movie it self, wasn't good. Most of the time was spent on the top and freaking cutting legs off and digging in them selves. It just didn't thrill me. One thing though it was creepy when the flowers on the plants were mocking the ring tone on the phone. That sent a little chills down, but then the rest was predictable. There were too many unanswered questions for me and was not pleased.",The Ruins
373,ap_phonehome,A True Waste Of My Life,1,27 July 2008,"If you value your life in any way, shape, or form, you will do yourself a courtesy and pass by this seemingly ""interesting"" movie on the DVD rack.I know what you're thinking, ""I saw the preview and it looked GREAT!"" However, buyer beware, I fell into the same trap. One of my friends expressed certain reluctance to watching this movie, but I forced her to sit it out. Oh, how I regret that decision.Like most horror movies, the movie starts out cheerfully in a sunny Mexican resort where two couples are lured to an ancient Mayan Ruin by a fellow resort-goer. Upon arrival, they are disturbed by the appearance of two jungle people who are all but oblivious to their greeting shouts. As if this isn't ominous enough, the tour group casts aside large plant growth and declares an unused path consumed by wildlife a perfect route to their destination. I guess it wouldn't be much of a movie if they utilized rational decision making and turned around just then, but, well, this wasn't much of a movie anyways.After some hiking, the sixsome (the resort goer brought a friend) stumble upon the ruins and at once their doubts are dispelled by its beauty and history. That is, until frantic tribal people emerge from the jungle armed with a vengeance for no reason in particular, shouting in an indecipherable language. Since when are brutal verbal assaults assuaged by calm, patronizing language - don't ask me - but nonetheless, the cast tries anyway, to no avail, obviously. Suddenly, the sixth trail member, Dimitri, is punctured with several arrowheads from the Mayans and all hell breaks loose. A gunshot finishes the job and the horrified travelers retreat quickly up the ruin.Now, if there was ever a plot to this movie, it ended here. The introduction took at most 20 minutes and it was unfortunately the best 20 minutes of the movie. On top of the ruins, the now fivesome realizes they are stranded by murderous locals and proceed to make countless good decisions, one of them being to use a withered rope to lower one of their members into the bowels of the ruin. Needless to say, the adventurer is seriously hurt and then trapped within the ruins and the two girlfriends are gravely injured trying to rescue him.The rest of the movie continues plotlessly, with no real horror, only only blood and gore, as displayed when one girl yanks a plant growing within her out, gushing torrents of blood and then again when somebody's legs are cut off, only to have the same plat from within the girl strangle him later.My only satisfactions in this movie were observing the very attractive Jonathon Tucker, playing Jeff McIntire, grow increasingly more frazzled and distressed and sitting long enough to ascertain that almost all of the cast dies a horrible, gruesome death. Their simulated pain seems an adequate compensation for the time suck that was this movie.Supposedly, the storyline goes that the ruin is an ancient house of of dangerous spirits with an evil, flesh eating plant to ward off and consume unlucky visitors. Unfortunately, I got no such warning from screaming bloodthirsty plants and the only evil thing relating to this movie that I am truly horrified by is the script writer.",The Ruins
374,theruinswashorrible,Warning: You Are About to Waste 91 Minutes of Your Life,1,27 July 2008,"This movie was so bad my friends and I laughed out loud. It is not scary at all. The flowers that sound like cellphones ringing should have been my cue to turn this movie off..but I hoped that it would improve. First off, who wears white skinny jeans and flip flops to go on a 3 mile hike through the rain forest to a Mayan pyramid?? Ugh. Although the ""adventurers"" aka ""drunken tourists looking to find a treasure"" do not obviously speak Mayan, they should have realized that when the Mayan man was yelling at them and making hand gestures to stay away from the temple, that was an indication that something creepy was going on and they should turn back. The grossest part of the movie was when they amputate the guy's legs on top of an ancient pyramid with a bottle of alcohol and a rock and, no surprise here, he died....but anyone who has watched LOST would have known that is what happens.The movie just ends and leaves you unsatisfied, it doesn't answer any questions that you may have. The plot itself is one bad mistake after the next, and totally predictable. It gets to the point where you are yelling at the characters not to do certain things because it is just so obvious that they are going to die if they do what they are about to. There is no resolution, no ending to sum things up, it's just like okay the end. They see a rope on top of the pyramid and decide to go down and look for their German friend's brother Dimitri, who has disappeared from the temple (ominous anyone??)...so they lower themselves down with an old, thin rope which (no surprise here) cannot support their weight- dropping them onto the hard pyramid floor where they sustain major injuries. Common sense, anyone?? The description on the back of the box is so deceiving, it actually sounds entertaining, scary, and witty- the actual movie is none of those things. I am truly disappointed that it was as bad as it was. I did not lose any sleep being frightened from this ""horror"" movie. I apologize for all the people out there like myself who had expectations for this movie and were so disappointed.",The Ruins

I like horror movies, but fully appreciate that most of them are terrible, but had a bit of high hopes for this movie after seeing the reviews on IMDb.

If I had to compare this film's entertainment value with another's, I would say ""Wrong Turn"" for the same reasons as above: too many weak points.So basically, unless your planning on making out with your girl/boyfriend while this plays in the background, you can safely skip this one.",The Ruins

Most of the horror movies in 2008 were crap, so The Ruins shined. The acting was well done from everyone except Shawn Ashmore. Jena Malone did a job acting job as usual, Jonathan Tucker and Laura Ramsey surprised me. Laura Ramsey did the most amazing job when she went crazy. The suspense was really good even though I did read the book and some what knew what was coming. But the ending for the DVD really ticked me off I preferred the theatrical ending. Overall this movie did well with it's budget and made a good movie. The fact that ""Asylum"" was given $11,000,000 to make such a crap film makes The Ruins a well done movie.

If you want a summary I suggest you read everyone else's blog.The characters are under developed and the acting at times is very cheesy, i'm not sure if its the editing but when you see a friend of yours gunned down in front of you, you're going to care for more than 10 seconds.First off, if the plants are that dangerous why can't they get some household items like gasoline and fire and burn the plants away. While on the subject why don't the characters try to burn the temple and the plants they had whiskey and a matches let's burn something. Then the whole, I hear a cell phone so let's jump on a weathered pulley without checking it out so I can fall thirty feet or so and break my back. Then have a stupid woman follow and basically throw her body at the ground. Then the doctor is no help no pointers or tips even going down himself, he lets the two genius' go down and basically break his back even further. Then they realize the plants are trying to eat them and they leave the guy who can't move right on the edge as if they were daring them to eat him. And the one girl believes that there is still one vine inside her and so begins cutting her flesh off and then stabs her boyfriend in the heart with the knife(and there's no blood for some reason) and then she's like oh I didn't mean to.And finally I can forgive the fact that they traveled there with not so much as a flash light. But if you figure out the natives are afraid of the plants then you should probable use that to your advantage. If you infect everyone then I doubt they will be so gun happy.

383,archaipersonae,"Dumb all-American kids: Please, save them!",4,8 February 2011,"This movie is what you COULD call ""worth my time"", but only if your time has nothing more important on hold for your evening. A group of four (rather stupid) north American students go on a trip to Mexico after booze, beaches, sex and of course, ""fun"". And it's embedded in this quest for ""fun"" that they do decide to follow a complete stranger into the deep woods after a lost Mayan pyramid. To begin with, all the signs that their mere presence there is not welcomed are very clear, and still they don't quite see it. And when threatened by locals who don't want them to leave the place, stupidity comes from under their skins and well, all hell breaks loose. Oh, there is quite a lot of patriotism in this movie, of course. The European characters are regarded as ""sub- par"" to the all-American boys. Stock-ready Mexicans, well, let's not even go there. And of course, there is the hilarious moment when the ""golden boy utter the phrase ""Four American people just DO NOT DISAPPEAR like this. Some WILL come"". I guess he was betting on the CIA to drop from helicopters, just to rescue these proud Yankee youngsters in the middle of the jungle... That was it for the plot. Now, the execution itself is just... mediocre. OK, good visual effects overall, t's hard to make believe that plants are moving by themselves. As for the sound effects, my heart goes out, talking plants must've been a tough cookie to makeshift, but anyway, not good enough. Not scary enough. Not brave enough. Making it short: if you want to spend your time wathcing a movie about dumb chiseled-abs teens spending their time on top of a pyramid waiting to die without doing pretty much anything to avoid it, then this s your movie.

384,greenday-evans,Underrated [6.5],6,23 January 2012,"The first thing i want to say is that this film does not deserve all of the bad reviews it's getting. Sure it's not the best horror movie in the world, but compared to a lot of recent ones it's very good indeed.Basically it's about 4 American tourists Jeff, Amy, Eric and Stacy, on holiday in Mexico, whilst lounging by the pool they meet a German tourist called Mathiaswho invites them along to explore some Mayan ruins that are ""off the beaten track"" of course the Americans agree.Once they get there though, they find something sinister is afoot, angry Mayans surround them and will not allow them to leave and the plant life appears to be able to mimic sounds, mess with peoples minds and have a hunger for human flesh.Pros: The acting is very good here, particularly Luara Ramsey as Stacy whose character gets put through the most truama out of the 5, Ramsey pulls off her decent into paranoia, terror and delirium very convincingly, especially during her final scene, you can almost feel the physical and mental pain the character is going through, those few minutes contain easily the best acting in the movie.Despite about 80% of the film being in the same setting it still kept me interested and wondering what would happen next, also -unusually for a horror film- it is set mostly in bright daylight, and does not rely on darkness or shadows to build suspense, which is an interesting change.Cons: The aforementioned Stacy is pretty much the only character to be given ANY emotional depth at all, this is not the fault of the actors, all of whom did a good job, but if the script contains no character development then it doesn't matter how good the actor is,the character will feel one dimensional.There are a LOT of unanswered questions e.g.how did the vines come to be there in the first place? Their abilities of mimicking sounds and messing with the characters minds -like when they make Stacy think that Eric and Amy of having sex behind her back- are left unexplored. Likewise the Mayans remain a mystery too, they do not become violent until one of the characters touches the vines, it is unclear at first whether they wan them to climb the ruins or just leave, Also if they think that the tourists are infected then why not just kill them now, rather than force them to suffer the slow agonising death from the vines. The ending seemed a bit rushed and the problem of having no food or water- which was a big part of the book- is barely even mentioned.The frustrating thing is this film could easily have been so much better. Most of these problems could have been fixed just by adding an extra 30 minutes or so to the runtime, this would have allowed more space for character development and the development of the plot.Not the best horror movie ever, but still underrated and definitely worth renting at least.",The Ruins

I have grown up with classic horror films and perhaps it's just me, but I wasn't scared of some plants! I expected so much more violence and psychological distress, but perhaps you can't express this through films. Also, to see vines killing off party-crazed ""kids"" makes me question about where Hollywood's going with memorable originality. I'll give props for being creative both with the gory amputations, setting and concepts.

The Ruins, is not one of those that transcend the genre, but nonetheless, it is a very solid effort, if anything, because it is unique.The set-up is generic for a horror film. Sexy (and occasionally naked) college kids in a foreign place (in this case, somewhere in Latin America) where they do not speak the native tongue and decide to visit some Mayan ruins that are hidden well in the jungle.However the movie then takes some very unexpected turns. The movie becomes much more of a psychological thriller than a horror film, but the gore is still plentiful for the gore-hounds out there. Another unusual aspect, most of the film takes place in broad daylight. As a result, the special effects are fantastic.The film is eventually undone by poor directing (the movie would have been much more suspenseful if the director did not make each clue as to the secret threat obvious to any fan of horror film).Overall, this is a horror film that while not great (like the Descent or Slither) is worth the time, if only to see something different.

It is kind of strange to say, but this movie is actually really powerful and moving. The things the characters endure to try to survive is gut wrenching and intense and it really gets to you. You really feel so much for the characters, nothing like in any horror movie before and at parts, its hard to watch what they have to go through. The acting is great in this movie and everyone does an excellent job. But, Laura Ramsey definitely stood out. She was so completely and utterly amazing in this movie. She gave the best performance I have seen in a movie in a while, and gave the best performance I have ever seen in a horror movie before. She played her character with such raw emotion and makes the pain, confusion, and suffering her character goes through so unbelievably real that it gives you chills. You feel for her character so much, for her character is the one that suffers the most throughout the movie. She makes it so real it is hard to watch, and you are left amazed by her performance.

398,freakonaleash_lp,"Not great, so what?!",4,1 June 2008,"I saw this movie last night, not because I wanted to, but because of a lack of choice. I have but one thing to say: just because it's a slasher that's based on a slightly different premise than, say, zombies or viruses that destroy all humanity doesn't make it any good. Especially on a weak script such as this.The cast seems talented, but doesn't have much to work with. The pace is maintained throughout, but at many points in the movie, I was left wondering just where exactly the story was taking me. Cheap scares (like that dog in the taxi... wtf was that!?!) and unnecessary gore abound. As an interesting side-note, I finally managed to place Amy (Jena Malone) as the chick from Donnie Darko. She was cute in that one, and doesn't disappoint here.What I can't understand is that, if you admit the faults in direction, story and CGI, why would you rank this movie so high? I watched this drivel so you don't have to. Stay away!",The Ruins
399,oliviercspencer,Simply the worst film I have ever seen..,1,16 February 2016,"The time is currently 1pm, it is 16 hours since I sat through this film and I am still angry at how awful it was.The plot / storyline, characters and ending could have been written by an 8 year old and I assume that is who this film is aimed at.Imagine four stereotypical American students, looking for adventure in a foreign land. They come across an ancient Mayan temple, but there is nothing mysterious or spiritual about it, just a plant that for some inexplicable reason has decided to imitate mobile phone sounds and eat humans. Why it does this, rather than eating the plentiful supply of birds and small mammals that would be present in a jungle type environment, is never explained. Then in typical Hollywood style, the 'locals' are portrayed as gun wielding lunatics who attack the students (again for no clear reason, when they could simply make them leave) and force the four students to stay on top of (not within) the temple, until they are slowly eaten by the bizarre plant. Nothing else of note happens in the film.The film is only 90 minutes, but it feels more like 4 hours, as the wafer thin and boringly predictable characters stumble from one mistake to the next or just sit there complaining about their predicament.About 45 minutes into the film I was hoping that all the main characters would hurry up and die, so the film could end. Unfortunately one of them survives, which makes me very concerned that some deluded film maker may try to make a sequel at some point in the future.I can't believe that anyone funded, made, produced and released this film. With a few little tweaks here and there, this film could be a comedy, it really is that bad.",The Ruins
400,arkane8,Cliché Movie With Idiot Characters To Irritate You,4,25 May 2009,"When I saw 6.0 on IMDb, I was rather impressed and excited to watch this movie, as a 6 for a horror movie should be rather entertaining. At first I thought it was going to be some disturbing, unseen evil force (having not read the book) to terrify the audience -- but it turns out to be something rather mundane -- killer plants. Regardless, I am a rather open-minded individual when it comes to movies so I thought perhaps the movie would bring some kind of breakthrough spin on carnivorous vines.Unfortunately, it failed to meet my expectations due to the excessive amounts of cliché and lack of any originality. To top it off, the female lead character continues to annoy you off with her stupidity. Unless the movie is intentionally a bad B-rated movie that is entertaining in the hilarity of badness, no movie should ever ever ever have a main character irritate you if one expects the audience to care about the character. Such roles should be reserved for secondary characters. Characters were undeveloped, the monsters (plants in this case) left unexplained, and clichés were dripping all over.The only thing that is mildly effective are some of the bloody/gory scenes, although the gore pales in comparison with movies like High Tension or Ichi The Killer. Consistently failed logic (such as why would a character not watching the top of a rope during a second attempt at descending into the ruins when it just snapped and almost killed someone), even if minor, adds up and just continues to anger the audience. The movie could've saved itself by using characters or some kind of story device to reprimand or ""redeem"" idiot characters who just did something stupid (or at least let the character recognize or regret her own mistakes). But to continue to allow idiocy to preside will certainly cause the audience to abandon all care for the character, in turn taking away the terror of the movie.Overall this is a poorly done movie. An example of a well done movie involving pretty twenty-something's getting killed is the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (and the prequel too) that certainly instilled fear and had much less character logic flaws. In summary, if you have a lot of time to kill, go watch it if there's nothing else. Otherwise, don't waste your time with this sub-par flick and go see something actually scary and highly satisfying like The Hills Have Eyes remake.",The Ruins
401,kaosnklutter,"smart, original horror movie",8,5 April 2008,"**MOVIE SPOILERS*** * * * * * * * Being a 23 year old female not alive when most of the horror genre ""cult classics"" were released, I thought this movie was a fresh breath of air in a genre thriving on remakes and extreme gore. I just saw this movie last night and watching it, I was so absorbed with their emotions, their dispare, their hunger, their diminishing hope, their fear, realistic portray of human emotion, there was yelling, distrust, so much going through their minds. This among other things is why I thought this was a well rounded horror movie. It is pretty smart and somewhat original (no offense but take a look at all of the re-makes that are hitting the theaters..prom night, the fog, even as far back as 2003's Texas chainsaw remake) It had its fair share of gore and squeamish moments but the whole movie was not based around torture (Like the Saw series, Hostel I&II) Take for example the vines- I'm sure at some point in the past some other horror movie has had attacking vines (or trees.. lol @ Evil Dead)...but these vines are worse, vines that crawl into open wounds, living and moving inside of the body, feeding idea's into the mind (ie: Stacy thinking Amy and Eric were having sex on the Ruin. *sarcasum* because yes if i was stuck on a giant Mayan ruin I would have sex with my friends boyfriend... um no!!!) She totally went crazy when the vines were in her, even going as far as flaying herself to get them out and then finally committing a horrible act (which I will refrain from spoiling). Coming into this movie though, I had no idea who the antagonist was going to be. I know I shouldn't have but I assumed from trailers it was going to be some scary creature (like those from the Descent) living in the ruins, yet it was a little smarter than that, the red flowers imitating sounds, misleading, confusing and ultimately tormenting and mocking the travelers. Now here's where it gets deeper- not only do they have this horrible monster on the ruin they are on, but they are being forced to remain there by another killer, gun toting Mayans who believe the sacred grounds of the ruins must remain untouched. The Mayans believe once touched by the vines or ruins the person touched must remain on those sacred grounds and if they refuse, go as far as killing anyone- and I mean anyone who touches those grounds. To them it is the only option to stop the vines from spreading to their lands. The acting was okay, a few laughs, but really the only thing I didn't like was the ending. There could be a possible sequel but I hear thats how it was written in the book too. Overall an enjoyable horror movie.",The Ruins

403,gzgtp,Stupid movie,1,13 April 2017,"This movie is stupid, the characters are made to act in a way that portrays them as having no common sense, which I get that in most horror movies there's usually one or two dumb characters, but every character in this movie seems to be just plain stupid. Even the ""smart"" characters seems pretty dumb. Also the plot is not scary at all and to be honest it's by far one of the worst movies I wished I'd never seen. This movie made me angry at whoever produced it, mainly because it never should have been made.....seriously stupid, boring movie, wouldn't even call it a horror movie. Bottom line don't waste your time.",The Ruins
404,cricket_loving_girl,Irritating,2,25 June 2008,"I saw this yesterday with a friend, and I have to be honest, I'm glad it was half-price-ticket night. If I'd have paid full whack I would have been very annoyed. My friend and I spent most of the film looking at each other in amused disbelief whispering 'oh for god's sake'. Everyone else in the cinema clearly agreed, because they were all laughing instead of screaming, and saying 'no way, come on, you've got to be kidding'. The acting isn't the worst I've seen, but it's a long way from the best - although with such a script the actors would have been hard pushed to give stellar performances. The storyline quickly became ridiculous, and it was hard to care what happened to these whiny obnoxious people. And the thing that they were scared of... sheesh. Is that the scariest thing they could come up with? The horror genre has hit a new low. It was boring. What frightened me is the time I wasted on this film that I'll never get back. I could have gone to the gym, visited my parents, done the freakin vacuuming for crying out loud.And I actually walked out at one point, and got my friend to text me when that part was over so I could come back in. Not because it was scary, but because the part in question was completely stupid. Won't spoil it for you. But I think you'll know the part I mean if you go.Overall, not at all scary, just gross, and not entertaining in any way shape or form. The entire cinema audience, including my friend and myself, said almost in unison 'Thank God that's over!' as the credits rolled. I would advise you not to waste your time and money. This is one boring film.",The Ruins
405,dmarlb1,Don't be fooled.,4,6 April 2008,"I was convinced to see this movie after seeing that it was at a 7.3/10 on IMDb and i can usually trust the voters. USUALLY. i gave it a 3/10 for a few reasons. i wont spoil anything or at least try not to. the movie had some new ideas, but considering that the majority of the movie is spent with the characters at the ruins, and that this is a horror movie, the people at our theater including myself laughed the whole time. some of the acting and situations were so absurd that you would have thought we were in a comedy. the most heard comment that i heard leaving was ""this movie was scary, incredibly stupid , and the funniest horror movie I've ever seen""",The Ruins
406,lucciadelmoira,A very basic horror premise with plot gaps to large to ignore,4,8 November 2021,"This movie follows a group of teenagers on vacation who tag along with a German student to his brother's archeological dig. Once there, they find the dig site is within a Mayan ziggurat which is infested with a carnivorous, highly advanced parasitic plant, capable of rapid movements, aural mimicry, and bloodborne contagion. Once inside, the crew discovers the dig site is a graveyard. The Maya remnant prevent them from leaving and injuries-- thus plant attacks-- pile on.While having some striking horror scenes, this movie has some massive plot holes: namely, the native Maya remnant, who fail to prevent people from entering the dig site but are perfectly capable of preventing them from leaving. From its depiction of the Maya, the movie is a step above savage tribespeople tropes (their motivations are sensible and they act in an organized fashion), but the fact the Maya fail to prevent people from entering the ruins is ridiculous. The tribe is aware they live on the doorstep of a potentially world-ending threat, yet the best they can do to stop it is surround it only *after* outsiders have stumbled on it? It doesn't make very much sense. Not only that, conservation of energy is very much in question with the plants, as is the question of why they haven't overtaken the planet with how unrelentingly dangerous they are (par for the course in these kitschy horror films).I guess this fits a specific niche in horror, but if I were you, I'd just watch something like The Ritual (more realistic threat within its world), Alien (better body horror), or any number of movies with better cinematography, story, etc.This movie's one saving grace: although the script is generic as hell (and the dumb blonde is promiscuous and dies swiftly, which I take personal offense to) the acting is pretty alright, especially from the main 5.",The Ruins
407,jwill253,Destroyed the book,1,17 May 2008,"The book was fantastic, scary and suspenseful, but this movie completely destroyed the book. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie but what a disappointment. The only redeeming quality about this movie is Laura Ramsey nude, that is at the front of the movie, after that the movie goes down hill fast. Absolutely nothing scary about this movie except for the fact that someone actually made it so bad. This would have been great had they stayed true to the book. As it is, a total waste of time and money. Maybe some day someone will remake this using the book as it's foundation. With this the only similarity is the characters names and the blood thirsty plant.",The Ruins
