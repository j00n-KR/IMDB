0,Leofwine_draca,Slick haunted house-style thriller,6,4 December 2016,"As the ""haunted house"" chiller seems to currently be in vogue, it comes as no surprise that all the big studios should jump on the bandwagon - after all, they're hoping for another SIXTH SENSE. This tale in particular is an old-fashioned ghost story free of the ludicrously poor CGI special effects which have ruined fare like THE HAUNTING remake. While it certainly passes the time and is well worth watching, be warned that this is no SIXTH SENSE. What it is, is a derivative thriller only worth watching due to the direction and actors involved.Firstly, the bad points. As is the case with a lot of films today, this film desperately needs some originality. The story of a woman being haunted in a house alone is a very old one indeed and WHAT LIES BENEATH is content to rehash a lot of the clichés we associate with haunted house fare - the ancient creaking door scene for one. Another flaw is the film's bloated running time - at two hours and ten minutes, this one will give you cramp and for no reason, either. Some subplots and scenes - such as the psychiatrist interludes - could happily be hacked from the script with little effect. A lot of the scenes in the film are needlessly prolonged, and some careful pruning could have added some excitement. Strangely enough, in the finale, the opposite occurs and about fifty mini scenes are packed into ten minutes - this is where all the excitement has been stored, and the sudden adrenaline rush seems a bit hurried and desperate in itself.Another problem is the so-called ""horror"" content. For me, this film works better as a thriller for many reasons. Every time there's a pause, or a potentially scary moment in this film, you just know things are building up to a jump scene, where somebody or something appears suddenly in the film and there's a loud burst of music on the soundtrack. The classic example of this would be somebody turning around and bumping into somebody else suddenly. This happens in WHAT LIES BENEATH a lot. A heck of a lot. While this kind of basic shock tactic works, it's just horror at its most simplistic and therefore rather disappointing. You won't find any of the creepiness of THE SIXTH SENSE around here.The acting from seasoned veterans Pfeiffer and Ford is excellent, as to be expected. With Pfeiffer you would expect nothing less, and it's refreshing to watch a respected actress appear in a film like this now that it's fashionable as opposed to the wealth of TV actresses appearing in such fare in a television format throughout the nineties. As for Ford, he plays a deliberately boring character for much of the film but really comes into his own towards the end; he's cast against type and great with it. As for the other actors, the underrated Joe Morton is wasted as a pointless psychiatrist while Diana Scarwid is an exceptionally irritating friend of Pfeiffer's. James Remar thankfully pops up to put in a nice imposing performance.Packed with red-herrings, lots of clichés, and enough references to Hitchcock to make you sick, this is a flawed but interesting film and a darn sight spookier than many previous offerings in the '90s. CGI is thankfully shoved aside in favour of more old fashioned scares, with the ugly computer animation only popping up a couple of times. One exceptional scene - this film's highlight - does for the bathtub what PSYCHO did for the shower, with a prone and paralysed Pfeiffer lying in a bathtub slowly filling with water. A horrific concept expertly done, immediately followed by the film's best scare. Other things to watch out for include plot holes (Pfeiffer retrieves a buried casket from underwater single-handedly), one moment of painful violence, and the crazy ""chase"" ending which really gets the adrenaline pumping. The ending of the film is predictable but effective. WHAT LIES BENEATH may not be a masterpiece in this particular genre, but it's well worth a watch.",What Lies Beneath
1,SnoopyStyle,Slow creepy horror,5,25 February 2014,"Norman (Harrison Ford) a university research scientist, and Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer) are left with an empty nest after their only daughter went off to college. The next door neighbor Feurs are fighting, and one day Claire finds the Mrs Feur (Miranda Otto) crying hysterically. Then Mrs Feur disappears and she starts spying on Mr Feur (James Remar). She keeps having creepy things happen in their house which leads them to think that the house is haunted. She goes to see therapist Dr. Drayton (Joe Morton) who suggests contacting the ghost.I didn't realize this was a horror until I started watching. So it caught me a little off guard. It's a slow creepy horror from director Robert Zemeckis who isn't the usual suspect. It meanders along at a crawl, but every once in awhile, it strikes a familiar horror tone. When she's spying on Feur, there is definitely a 'Rear Window' vibe. When the creepy things happen, there is a ghost haunting vibe. Zemeckis is good enough to pull off good scenes. However the movie keeps moving and twisting. It never really settles down for a good scare. It becomes a matter of waiting to see what the final twist is.",What Lies Beneath
2,lee_eisenberg,"believe it or not, they actually managed to do it right",8,27 June 2005,"Too many horror movies today are little more than excuses to have a bunch of special effects, or to show gratuitous violence. ""What Lies Beneath"" gets it right. A sort of homage to Hitchcock, the whole movie makes you jump. Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer) has been seeing many strange things around her Vermont home. Her husband Norman (Harrison Ford) figures that she's just imagining everything. But as Claire investigates, she uncovers some deadly secrets, to the point where she (and we) are uncertain whom we can trust.This movie shows that, although we might assume that the director behind ""Forrest Gump"" couldn't possibly helm a horror film, we would be wrong. Dead wrong. ""What Lies Beneath"" is bound to scare you.",What Lies Beneath
3,jboothmillard,What Lies Beneath,6,23 September 2005,"Director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) proves himself a versatile director with this spooky supernatural thriller. Basically retired concert cellist Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer) was involved in a car accident, and now a year on she has to go through sending her daughter Caitlin Spencer (Katharine Towne) to college. Now Claire is convinced she can hear voices, and suspects her quite new neighbour of murder, and Claire's husband, university research scientist Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford) is very concerned for her. The suspected murder of the neighbour, Mary Feur (The Lord of the Rings' Miranda Otto) by husband Warren (James Remar) is cleared up, but Claire is still sure that a spirit is trying to tell her something. She sees the woman's face in the bath, and tells a little bit more to shrink Dr. Drayton (Joe Morton), and eventually she finds a name, based on some initials she found. It turns out husband Norman knew this girl that disappeared, he had an affair with her, and unfortunately for Claire, he plans her to be his next victim, drowning her while she is still from breathing chloroform. The last scenes of Claire trying to escape (after her body is back to normal), and the car plunges into the lake, with Norman going down with it, because of the body of the dead girl grabbing him, is very interesting. Also starring Diana Scarwid as Jody and Amber Valletta as Madison Elizabeth Frank. The spooky moments all add the mystery, Pfeiffer is convincing as the traumatised, Ford drops his lovable action hero persona completely to become a sinister and quite unexpected villain, definitely worth a look. If you have Scary Movie 2, then you would recognise the spoof of the ""I think she's starting to suspect something"" moment, and in the deleted scenes, the still in the bath sequence. Good!",What Lies Beneath
4,rmax304823,Stale Horror.,3,4 August 2015,"Not much needs to be said about this over-familiar story of a woman harassed by ghosts in her new lakeside house except that the performances are quite good and the budget greater than a much better horror story like ""Carnival of Souls."" Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful, as always, but the role itself is written strictly by the numbers. She's the helpless victim that no one believes, from any Lifetime Movie Network film of your choice. I don't know why they hired Harrison Ford to be the stereotypical husband. It must have cost them a good deal. But, like other husbands in these flicks, he's a workaholic, skeptical, down-to-earth, and puzzled by Pfeiffer's claims. (He sends her to a shrink.) What a waste of money. Any one of dozens of professional B-level Canadian men could have done the job as well.But why go on? You've seen every second of it before, in one or another film about haunted women in haunted houses. There has to be a best friend who half-believes too, and who tries to help. They usually die. I didn't sit around long enough to see if Diana Scarwid, a fine actress, dies.The musical score borrows heavily from two sources: ""Psycho"" and ""The Shining."" There is a loud WHOOSH or a WHAM and a piping shriek from Pfeiffer whenever a gust brushes through the shrubbery or the door slowly and ominously creaks open. (The family dog comes in.) The movie never misses a shot, no matter how cheap the thrill.Pfui.",What Lies Beneath
5,moonspinner55,What lies beneath? A smarter movie struggling to get out...,6,6 December 2006,"Robert Zemeckis' homage to Hitchcock (funny how we always say 'homage' and not 'plagiarism') concerns a married couple, their spooky new house, a suspicious neighbor...and enough red herrings to weigh down any commercially-viable product. Still, I was hooked for about a third of the way (once the wife supernaturally took on the persona of a missing woman and seduced her husband with a little licking and biting, I began losing faith). By the finale, so many gimmicks are being thrown at the screen, it just becomes an upscale B-flick. All the inconsistencies aside, one has to applaud Michelle Pfeiffer for her gratifying performance; even though the entire subplot about Pfeiffer's neighbor leads nowhere, she is very appealing walking up to the man in public and calling him a ""murdering son-of-a-b*tch"". Harrison Ford is fairly solid as well, until the last act which leaves both he and Michelle completely rudderless. That's when the filmmakers go overboard and sink this suspense-thriller in a sea of slick desperation. **1/2 from ****",What Lies Beneath
6,dbdumonteil,"Ouija Board, Ouija Board, would you help Claire Spencer Solving her problems?",4,19 March 2004,"An eclectic although a bit erratic filmmaker throughout his career, Robert Zemeckis chose to shot a movie with a very trendy topic since several years: psychological fantastic movie. The result is ""What Lies Beneath"". What did I think of this movie? It disappointed me a lot and disappointment is all the more significant as this movie had been highly praised. I think that quite obviously Zemeckis isn't gifted for psychological fantastic.Lots of people had told me that ""What Lies Beneath"" was a creepy film. Frankly, I must say that I wasn't scared at all. On the contrary, certain sequences made me laugh. Zemeckis is powerless to establish a lasting feeling of fear, anxiety and this way he can't hold a candle to Night Shyamalan (the Sixth Sense, 1999) or even Adrian Lyne (Jacob's Ladder, 1990), partly because quite a lot of sequences are too carefully made to create fear. Furthermore, such a mysterious story should convey suspense. But just like fear, Zemeckis is unable to create and maintain it during the whole movie and it is in a comparative indifference that you watch Michèle Pfeiffer's investigation until she finds the horrible truth.The scenario of ""What Lies Beneath"" in its general line could have given rise to a great fantastic movie. Besides, the beginning of the film turns out to be promising thanks to the paranormal phenomenons (the doors that open themselves, the bathtub that fills itself with water) but as the movie goes along, these strange phenomenons tend to be less frequent and you almost deal with a trite detective movie. Moreover, Zemeckis' efforts to make the movie fascinating are ineffective, even by using some processes linked to detective movie such as the wrong track (the first sequences when Pfeiffer suspects her neighbor to be a murderer).Basically with ""What Lies Beneath"", the filmmaker wanted to make a good fantastic movie that paid a tribute to Alfred ""Hitch"" Hitchcock. All right, why not? But the problem is that Robert Zemeckis mistakes tribute and borrowing. Because he borrows too many sequences, ideas from the master of suspense, he makes his movie dull and it loses of its appeal and its credibility. In short, too many borrowings end up spoiling the movie. It is also to be noted that Zemeckis didn't only draw his inspiration from Hitchcock. Indeed, the paranormal phenomenons recall ""the Sixth Sense"" whereas it is difficult not to think of ""Shining"" by Kubrick and ""les diaboliques"" by Clouzot for the sequences in the bathroom. Even the conclusion of the plot has nothing amazing because it recalls a thriller entitled ""the Stepfather"" (1987).In the middle of these shortcomings, the movie has only one asset: the directing, it means the way Zemeckis shot his sequences where he shows a certain ease.Ultimately, ""What Lies Beneath"" is an unremarkable supernatural thriller with allusions or rather borrowing from Hitchcock. Fortunately, Zemeckis was to shot a better and more down-to-earth movie the same year: ""Cast Away"".",What Lies Beneath
7,blanche-2,doesn't pass the acid test,6,4 February 2001,"The acid test is, if huge stars weren't in this film - could it have been a made for television movie?  Alas, the answer for this one is an unqualified yes.  There is nothing original about this script and it is structurally poor.  It could have been so much better with just a little attention paid to it, but as it is, it's fairly poor, full of red herrings and unnecessary characters and slower than molasses.",What Lies Beneath
8,Quinoa1984,"Kinda spooky, kinda weird",6,21 July 2000,"This film is made by Robert Zemeckis, the guy who is responsible for such classics as Back to the Future where a dolorian became a time travel unit, and Forrest Gump where a slow wit goes in an American odyssey to find love. This film takes a turn into Hitchcock land, but Hitchcock would never make this movie, despite many obvious references to his work.  The plot here involves a suspicious wife (Michelle Pfieffer is good here) who is now getting weird vibes in her house, mainly because it is haunted.  But of course, the husband (Harrison Ford is always exceptional) is skeptical if what her wife is saying is true.  Now, with this, it makes 2/3 a good movie, 1/3 a weird finale and 3/3 OK.  Definately not Zemeckis' best work to see, but it is better than some of the other crap out there in the theaters today.  B",What Lies Beneath
9,michaelRokeefe,A slow and easy fright fest. First rate terror!,7,26 August 2000,"A professor's wife believes that her neighbor is a murderer; but her personal terror is trying to cope with a spirit haunting her new home. Harrison Ford is what we think is a mild mannered genius. His neurotic wife is played by the ever classy Michelle Pfeiffer. We see a very different side of Ford and Miss Pfeiffer at one point has only her eyes to relay her torment. What I really liked best about the movie is the sound effects. It reminds me of days gone by when the sounds of the wind, a rainy night, footsteps and a squeaking door speak volumes. This movie is not necessarily too long, it just moves slowly getting to the energy packed finale. Your palms will sweat and you will inch to the edge of your seat. The terror filled twisting climax is well worth the ride.",What Lies Beneath

11,hitchcockthelegend,You're not yourself today are you?,7,1 October 2009,"Claire and Norman Spencer's marriage starts to fall apart when she believes there is a ghost in the house. Things gather apace when Claire is convinced that the spirit is trying to tell her something. Something that could be too close to home for comfort.Robert Zemeckis does Hitchcock? Well yes, the influence is obvious, unashamedly so. But the trouble with that, is having the maestro as a benchmark renders all other modern day attempts as folly. However, casting aside that gargantuan issue, What Lies Beneath is an effective creeper come thriller that boasts star credentials.Directed by Zemeckis, formed from an idea by Steven Spielberg (from the story by Sarah Kernochan) and starring Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as the fragmenting Spencer's. That's a pretty tidy bunch from which to launch your movie. What follows is a mixture of genuine unease and mystery, red herrings and standard boo jump moments, all of which almost gets lost on a saggy middle section as Zemeckis plays Hitchcock one too many times and loses sight of the supernatural heart of the piece, not helped by Clark Gregg's meandering script I might add. None the less, the picture gets pulled around for the finale as the spooky combines with thriller to produce some quality edge of the seat stuff. But it's only then that you totally realise that the makers here have tried to cram too much in to one film. In eagerness to manipulate the audience for the fine ending (though you probably will have it worked out at the half way point) the film just ends up as being confused as to what it mostly wanted to be.Pfeiffer is excellent and looks stunning and Ford gives it gusto when the script allows. Support comes from Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, Miranda Otto and James Remar. The house is suitably eerie with its waterside setting and Alan Silvestri's score is perfectly in tune with the creepy elements of the piece. It's a fine enough film in its own right, regardless of the Hitchcockian homages. It's just that it should have been a far better horror picture than it turned out to be. 7/10",What Lies Beneath
12,Theo Robertson,Unoriginal But Effective Enough On A Dark Night,7,10 November 2004,"!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! Robert Zemeckis directs Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer . If this had been released three or four years earlier it would have been a massive blockbuster since all three were at the height of their box office pulling power . In 2000 all three were slowly but surely sliding down the ladder a bit , but having said that the movie still did pretty good businessWHAT LIES BENEATH plays out like a Hitchcock thriller with Claire Spencer convinced there's something not right about the couple next door and her husband Norman being very cynical on the matter . Despite the unoriginal premise Zemeckis made me jump out of my seat a few times with some simple editing and sound effects . The story starts to twist about half way through into a supernatural thriller and there is a scene in the bath involving Claire and Norman that caused me to literally jump out of my seat so I have no complaints with supernatural elements being brought into the plot . Unfortunately there's one too many supernatural twist at the end which resolves the movie but is rather contrived in its level of coincidence and is rather ridiculous when you think about it in detailHaving said that I should just repeat that this movie caused me to jump a few times and we have the opportunity of seeing Harrison Ford in an unusual role . Don't think about it too much if you're watching it on TV one dark night and you might gain some scary enjoyment from WHAT LIES BENEATH",What Lies Beneath
13,preppy-3,Pfeiffer is great...the movie isn't,6,9 August 2000,"OK supernatural thriller.  Pfeiffer is very good as a woman who thinks she's going crazy.  Ford is HORRIBLE as her husband...he's incapable of playing a weak man.  The movie made me jump a few times but that's about it.  It's too long (the ending goes on FOREVER), the first hour has very little to do with the rest of the movie and it just gets dull.  Too bad.  Worth seeing for Pfeiffer's performance.  Otherwise, stay away.",What Lies Beneath
14,poolandrews,Well worked ghost story.,7,31 December 2007,"What Lies Beneath is set in Vermont where Claire (Michelle Pfieffer) & Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford) live in a lakeside house, after their daughter Caitlin (Katharine Towne) goes to college & Norman becomes obsessed with his job Claire is left home alone. Claire becomes convinced that the woman next door has been murdered & that her spirit is haunting her house tyring to communicate with her, but the woman turns up safe & well. Claire continues to hear things & strange occurrence's happen which lead her to believe the house is haunted, but by who & what do they want...Produced & directed by Robert Zemeckis this supernatural ghost story has a touch of psychological thriller about it too & is a well crafted old fashioned spooky tale of dark secrets from the past coming back to hunt the present. The script by Clark Gregg is apparently a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock Presents episode Mr. Blanchard's Secret (1956) & is a coolly effective supernatural thriller, it takes itself extremely seriously but as a whole it works & succeeds at what it sets out to do. At over two hours in length it is a long film but while watching it it didn't feel that long which is always a good sign, the story is absorbing & gripping as it starts off a lot like Rear Window (1954) but it turns out to be a huge red herring & it ends like some sort of horror themed Fatal Attraction (1987). This is the kind of film where every bit of seemingly useless exposition comes together at the end & is used, from the moment we know that the phones don't work on the bridge you just know it's going to be used somewhere & the explanation by the two scientists about the paralysing drug which stands out at the time as being extraneous is also put to good use before the film finishes. If you have the patience to stick with it, not be put off by a slightly sedate pace then What Lies Beneath is a really good supernatural thriller.Director Zemeckis made What Lies Beneath while production on another one of his films Cast Away (2000) starring Tom Hanks was shut down so Hanks could lose weight, that in itself seems a bit odd really as I would have thought you needed to give a film all your attention rather than just making one to pass the time. Anyway it didn't do the film any harm in the long run as it's very good, the film is very stylish too with a muted colour scheme that gives everything a dark, eerie overcast look & feel about it. There are plenty of jump out of your seat moments, Zemeckis uses every trick & cliché in the horror film book with people & dogs leaping into the frame unexpectedly, loud music playing when you least expect it although it also has some nice modern CGI computer effects too. The main difference here compared to lots of other horror films is that Zemeckis knows how to make the clichés work & turns in a highly effective film. The one stand out sequence is when Pfieffer is paralysed in the bath as it slowly fills with water, it's one of the most tension filled & suspenseful scenes I can remember seeing in a modern horror flick.With a supposed budget of about $90,000,000 one has to say that sounds like a hell of a lot of money for a film where not that much actually happens, it takes place almost entirely within one house with minimal effects & a small cast. Making near $30,000,000 on it's opening weekend alone I think I'm right in saying this was a big success & does prove modern audiences can sit & watch a two plus hour film which is mostly exposition based if it's done properly. The acting is very strong from the cast.What Lies Beneath is a a old school slow moving but involving supernatural horror thriller ghost story that I enjoyed a lot, I can see a lot of people being bored by it but as far as I'm concerned it's their loss.",What Lies Beneath
15,Boba_Fett1138,Excellent horror/thriller.,9,24 September 2003,"***REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** Don't read unless you have already seen this movie.The movie is very original in many ways and not like other horror and thriller movies at all.The best thing about ""What Lies Beneath"" is that it keeps surprising with many plot twist and it knows how to combine the horror and the thriller elements in a most excellent way.The first 30 minutes are a stroke of genius. It starts of like an Hitchcock like thriller but after the fist 30 minutes your realize it was only a distraction and that the real story and plot is about something completely different.And yes, the movie is scary too. It has lot's of scary moments that will scare you time after time.Michelle Pfeiffer is simply brilliant and is a great leading lady. Harrison Ford also pulls of quite well, the first 1 and a half hours or so, as a good loving husband/father and the last 30 minutes as a really scary villain. It was amazing to see Harrison Ford in a villain role, it's too bad he never portrays villains because he really has a talent for it.The movie also features some great many long scene's with excellent camera work that really builds up the tension. It shows that Robert Zemeckis has a great talent for horror and timing.The best combination of thriller and horror I have ever seen with many surprising plot twist.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",What Lies Beneath
16,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""What Lies Beneath""? Well, a better movie than you might think",7,11 June 2009,"I haven't watched all that much by Zemeckis... mostly, what he's done just hasn't really gotten my attention, although I certainly wouldn't mind watching the Back to the Future trilogy, and I do think he did well on Death Becomes Her. I didn't know if I could expect this to be good, but I gave it a chance, and I'd say he can do horror. Granted, there are several cheap scares, the ""oh it was just the cat"" kind of thing, however, there certainly are more substantial ones herein, as well. The mood and atmosphere are very skillfully built up, and last successfully almost the entirety of this. Sadly, this does run a tad longer than it ought to... and to facilitate that, it employs an unsatisfying red herring that gets too generous an amount of time spent on it. I would also go so far as to claim the twist to be... I don't know, unnecessary? It worked, I'll give them that. The plot is fairly well-written and tends to develop well. Acting in this is quite magnificent. The cinematography and editing are excellent. There is a little language in this, sexuality is mainly hinted at or mentioned in dialog, and violence is relatively bloodless. I recommend this to fans of those who made it and/or the genres. 7/10",What Lies Beneath
17,view_and_review,Pulse Elevated,8,1 January 2021,"I'd be lying if I said this movie didn't have me at least a little spooked.

Claire Spencer (Pfieffer) believes it's the ghost of her neighbor Mary Feur (Miranda Otto). When she finds out in embarrassing fashion that it is not, her quest to find out the name of the ghost goes into a different, more personal direction.I thought director Robert Zemeckis did an excellent job with the camera shots and the pacing of this film that was greatly aided by Alan Silvestri's musical score.

18,neil-476,"Not bad, but...",7,7 May 2011,"What Lies Beneath is, in many respects, a traditional horror/psychological suspense thriller with a high profile cast and strong production values. It has a fair number of thrills and chills, decent performances from the principals, and keeps you guessing throughout much of its length.It is also far too long, and flawed by the inclusion of a first section which is intended to mislead you into wondering whether Michelle Pfeiffer's Claire is going mad - is she imagining manifestations, did the next door neighbour really kill his wife, do the significant close-ups we have been subjected to since the opening titles really mean anything or not. Eventually we learn that, no, none of this had any relevance whatsoever, and most of the first hour has been devoted to a red herring which goes no further. Fortunately, what follows isn't bad, but by this time a degree of fatigue has set in.The finale is small scale but effective.",What Lies Beneath
19,ferguson-6,Thanks Hitch!,6,30 July 2000,"Yes, Robert Zemekis seems to worship, not merely pay homage to, Alfred Hitchcok with this movie.  Yes, the preview gives away what could have been a nice plot twist.  Yes, sometimes the point of the movie seems to be making the audience jump in their seat.  Yes, I found this to be an enjoyable movie experience!  It is not great movie making.  Go see a real Hitchcok movie if that is what you are looking for.  This is just good old fashioned, shameless entertainment.  A suspense thriller for adults.  Most teenagers will think this is boring.  Harrison Ford is a nice selection.  Never really bought into his passion for work, and desire to eclipse dear old brilliant dad, but a more shady character would have killed the movie.  Actually two lesser leads would have turned this into just another Made for TV Friday night thriller.  Interesting note: Ford and Pfeiffer's daughter, Caitlyn, is played by real life daughter of the great Robert Towne.  Regrettably, her role is under-written here.  Excellent character actors James Remar and Diana Scarwid are under utilized also.  Go see this movie just for fun or wait and rent it.

20,anaconda-40658,Pfeiffer Lies Beneath.,6,8 August 2015,"What Lies Beneath (2000): Dir: Robert Zemeckis / Cast: Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, Miranda Otto: Chilling yet misguided thriller that has fun with the conventions. Title regards a ghost in plain context while symbolizing the secrets we wish to remain buried. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer arrive home after sending their daughter off to college. A couple move in next door and Pfeiffer suspects a body is carried out to the car. Strange things occur such as the front door not shutting or pictures falling on the floor but her biggest fear is that the spirit of a murdered woman is trying to possess her. Begins well but contains too many cheap scares and a muddled conclusion. A scene involving an Ouiji Board is awkward in a failed attempt at humour. Director Robert Zemeckis slowly reveals clues. This is quite different for a guy who made Forrest Gump and Back to the Future. Pfeiffer holds her own as a woman who questions her own sanity. Ford is overwhelming against type in a role that is truly surprising for him. The supporting roles are a big downfall. Diana Scarwid plays the neighbour but this issue is hardly dealt with. Joe Morton is flat as Pfeiffer's psychiatrist who won't admit that she is nuts. Miranda Otto and James Remar play the neighbours whom Pfeiffer suspects of nastiness. Marriage theme lies beneath a muddled but well made thriller. Score: 6 / 10",What Lies Beneath

Norman is a University Research Professor, and Claire a retired Cellist. After a recent auto accident, and seeing her college-bound daughter off, Claire becomes depressed, and begins to hear and see what may be the ghost of a young woman, or is she just losing her sanity? Is her neighbor a murderer, or is it someone else in her life that nobody ever suspected? Well cast and directed film unfortunately goes off the rails with an unappealing and melodramatic final twist at the climax, which, while surprising, is because viewer does not want to believe it!",What Lies Beneath
22,FlashCallahan,That girl must be brought up......,8,17 August 2015,"Norman Spencer, a university research scientist, is concerned about his wife, Claire, who a year ago was involved in a serious accident, and has just sent off her daughter to college. Claire starts hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. Claire thinks the phenomena may have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist, and she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice........... try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody, and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth..........So this film was made because Zemeckis had nothing to do while Tom Hanks lost weight for Castaway. If this really is the case, I wish Hanks does more of these roles, because the result is a solid 'Old-Fashioned' horror movie, with the ubiquitous Zemeckis sheen.The concept and story of the film isn't the most original thing in the history of cinema, but the unique selling point of this film is the twist. It's not as in your face as The Sixth Sense of Se7en, but to have Harrison Ford, the all American hero, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, the President for crying out loud, is a wonderful inclusion to what otherwise is a stereotypical ghost story.Zemeckis has obviously done his research on Hitchcock for his filming styles, and the references are a subtle as a sledgehammer. It's not a bad thing though, but sometimes they do cause you to roll your eyes a little. The first two acts are quite unsettling and and have a very strange feel to them. Zemeckis throws us a red herring, leading the audience to believe that Claire is being haunted by the girl next door. While it's a neat concept, it's dealt with too quickly and we are left with Claire doing a lot of detective work and basically letting the audience in on who the ghost is.But then the final third is with us, and it goes absolutely bonkers for the last twenty minutes. There is little dialogue shared between the two leads in this final part, but Zemeckis let's body language, camera angles and mise en scene take the forefront.Pfeiffer and Ford are both brilliant in their roles, so good, they actually make the rest of the cast seem a little cookie cutter in what they are doing.All in all, it's nothing more than a b-movie ghost story, glossed over with brilliant performances, and wonderful direction.And for once, the blatant use of digital effects only add to the charm of the movie.",What Lies Beneath
23,movieman_kev,An engrossing watch the FIRST time,7,12 October 2005,"Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) the wife of college professor Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford), begins to hear voices, sees ghastly images, and worries about her next door neighbor. Norman chalks it up to an over-active imagination bought about by stress from their daughter leaving for college coupled with them moving into a new house. But the truth is going to be much more sinister indeed. I didn't care more for Diana Scarwid as Jody in this one for some reason, but that's not enough to mar a well acted, taunt, fairly tightly plotted engrossing thriller such as this one. I even jumped once or twice in the third act.

24,Wuchakk,Ghostly happenings in northern Vermont with Ford & Pfeiffer,6,24 December 2019,"A couple living on Lake Champlain (Harrison Ford & Michelle Pfeiffer) face the empty nest syndrome as the wife experiences increasingly spectral happenings. Diana Scarwid, James Remar and Miranda Otto have peripheral roles.""What Lies Beneath"" (2000) is a Hitchcockian drama/mystery with a bit o' horror. It starts by borrowing from ""Rear Window"" (1954), but thankfully veers from there. At a little past the hour mark I was starting to get restless. The story was progressing too slowly with too many doors inexplicably opening. I suppose it didn't help that Pfeiffer doesn't trip my trigger, although she's serviceable (I wouldn't say I DON'T like her); and Harrison's character seems unjustifiably gruff and impatient.However, the Upstate Vermont/ New York locations are fabulous and a mysterious mood is effectively established. The way things pan out is unexpected, unless you saw the trailer first, which outrageously spoils it. The concluding F/X sequence is beautiful in a ghostly way and satisfyingly brings closure. What didn't make sense earlier is elucidated. At the end of the day, the movie's underwhelming, but not altogether unworthy if you're in the mode for a flick of this sort.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont/New York (Burlington, D.A.R. State Park, Waterbury & Westport) with other stuff done in Southern Cal (Los Angeles, Playa Vista & Culver City).GRADE: C+/B-",What Lies Beneath
25,zetes,Genuinely frightening film undone by overscoring,7,15 July 2001,"Well, actually, I liked this film enough to recommend it (7/10), but it could have been so much better. There are some damn scary scenes in this film, some of the most frightening I've ever seen, but the filmmakers chose to cheat instead. There's a stinger (loud, sudden music) every time anything remotely scary is about to happen. And they are loud. The system that I watched it on is pretty good, and the dialogue and sound effects were at a normal volume, but anytime they wanted me to jump, they could do it with that ultra-loud, high-pitched noise. It really undermines the film. And why did they do it? I have no clue. Think of how frightening it would have been if that woman's reflection had appeared next to Pfeiffer's in the bathtub without the stinger. I may have had a heart attack. Instead, I am forced to jump just to salvage my eardrums.",What Lies Beneath
26,trashgang,great performance by Pfeiffer,6,16 June 2009,"What Lies Beneath is one of those movies that came out when Hollywood was doing remakes and reduxes of J(apan) movies. So in other words it was ghost era. This flick has a bit of the same storyline. A couple living happy together get in trouble when their daughter leaves the house to go studying. Mommy has seen ghosts, she thinks. And that's were it's all about for me, mommy going from a normal woman to a woman who doesn't know what's going on anymore. The movie is all about Pfeiffer giving a great performance, maybe the best she's ever done. She's so believable. In the same period The Others came out with Kidman, but Kidman always acts the same, whispering that is. How comes the movie just got a 6 out of 10, Harrison did it. He is well type casted but gives a performance seen before from him. Let's be honest, when he's knocked out in the bathroom and he but his bleeding hand on the bath-tub, well sorry but the way he moves his hand made me think of Indiana Jones.

29,JamesHitchcock,"Effective, Genuinely Frightening Thriller",8,25 September 2004,"'What Lies Beneath' revolves around that classic cinema situation- the seemingly-perfect marriage that, on closer examination, turns out not to be so perfect after all. Claire and Norman Spencer appear to have such a marriage. They are a middle-aged, middle-class couple whose only daughter, Caitlin, has just started at university. Norman has a prestigious scientific job as a research geneticist, and they have recently moved into a large lakeside house in the Vermont countryside. Beneath this tranquil surface, however, Claire is a deeply troubled woman. She has developed an obsession with her next door neighbour, whom she suspects of having murdered his wife. She also comes to suspect her husband of infidelity. Worst of all, a series of eerie happenings have led her to suspect that her house may be haunted. Unsure whether these phenomena are real or illusory, she both consults a psychiatrist and uses a ouija board in an attempt to contact the supposed spirit. The title 'What Lies Beneath' can be read on a number of levels. At its most literal, it refers to the fact that the key to the mystery at the heart of the film lies hidden below the waters of the lake. The title can also, however, be read metaphorically as relating to underlying reality which may differ from surface appearance, to the world of the supernatural which may lie below the surface of our own, and to what may be hidden in the depths of a person's character. Many things in the film are not what they seem. At a trivial level, we learn that Norman is not, as we had been led to believe, Caitlin's father; she is Claire's daughter by a previous relationship. On a more serious level, a twist halfway through the film reveals that the truth is not what Claire, or the audience, had previously believed and that she is indeed in danger, but from a hitherto unsuspected source. (I will not reveal what that twist is). The director Robert Zemeckis says that he conceived this film as a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock. There are certainly a number of explicit references to his films. Claire's obsession with her neighbors and her habit of spying on them recalls James Stewart's character in 'Rear Window'. A scene where Claire is in danger of drowning in her bath is reminiscent of the famous shower scene in 'Psycho'. (The use of the Christian name Norman may also be a reference to that film). Another Hitchcock reference is to 'Rebecca'; in that film too, the key to the central mystery lies beneath the waters. There are also Hitchcock touches such as the occasional use of humour to lighten the mood, an example being Claire's unsuccessful attempt to hold a séance with her friend Jodie.Despite these deliberate acts of homage, the final result is a movie which bears little resemblance to a Hitchcock film. 'What Lies Beneath' not only has a strong supernatural element, it also suggests that ghosts and the supernatural are a reality rather than an illusion. Hitchcock, fascinated by psychology, particularly the psychology of human evil, paid little attention to the paranormal. A human murderer such as Norman Bates was, for him, far more frightening than any ghost. The lush photography, concentrating on the autumnal Vermont countryside in its various moods, is quite different to the Hitchcock style. At 130 minutes the film is considerably longer than most of Hitchcock's, and the narrative moves at a more leisurely pace.The first hour or so, much of which is spent on a theme which turns out to be a red herring, is perhaps too slow-moving, but even this helps to develop the characters and to create a general atmosphere of suspense. In the second half, following the unexpected twist, the film becomes much better and the pace increases. Ordinary objects- a mirror, a bath full of water- take on an aspect of menace as Claire fights for her life. The two leading roles are very well played. The film makes good use of the haunting beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer, still one of Hollywood's loveliest actresses in her forties. At times she comes across as glamorous and seductive, but more often she has a gaunt, fragile and vulnerable quality. Harrison Ford brings out the two contrasting sides of Norman's character. At first he seems solid and dependable, the personification of the scientific rationalist, an impression strengthened by his deep, resonant voice. As the film progresses, we learn what lies beneath this calm exterior and begin to suspect that his overly rationalistic outlook on life may not have prepared him to deal with the emotions of passion and jealousy. I am surprised at some of the negative reviews that this film has received. Although it may depart from the Master's stylistic rules, 'What Lies Beneath' is still a tense, effective, and at times genuinely frightening film, with several levels of meaning. One of the best thrillers of recent years. 8/10",What Lies Beneath
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Left with questions, but it's an effective thriller",6,27 July 2007,"I remember in 2000 seeing some of What Lies Beneath, but I never got to finish it, so I figured I would rent the movie recently. I just watched it last night and I have to say that actually this movie sent chills down my spine, I was really impressed with how intense it was. Michelle and Harrison were absolutely perfect for these roles, I couldn't imagine anyone else in their parts. My only problem with the film though was some of the questions were left unexplained, like the bloody shoe next door and how quickly the situation of Michelle's husband's situation was with the girl that was haunting her, but when you see the film, you'll see what I mean.Claire and Norman have just moved into a new home where their daughter has gone off to college and they are all alone. They seem like an extremely loving couple and that they have everything under control. But things get scary when Claire starts to hear voices and see ghostly images around the house. Norman thinks she's crazy of course, Claire first suspects her neighbor of murdering his wife, but then she realizes she is wrong and that her husband has a deadly secret that he's kept from her and now it's after her.What Lies Beneath was a great thriller and is a guarantee chill if you watch it at night with the lights turned off. The acting was great and the atmosphere was perfect, the director really had the feel of the film and what it should of been. Just the script needed more work I think, it just left me with some questions, I don't mind usually that much about that stuff, but with this film I felt it was kind of important. Not to mention I didn't like the ending with the computer effects, but I'm letting that go. Over all, I would recommend it, it's a scary thriller, but be prepared for unanswered questions.6/10",What Lies Beneath

Together with her scientist husband Norman (Harrison Ford), they try to seek the truth behind the haunting.While not the best horror movie I've seen, this does stand out a bit from other horror movies, which are typically ghost/killer-on-the-loose flicks, with the screaming protagonists frantically trying to escape or trying to do the antagonists in. This film, on the other hand, has a captivating plot; coupled with the the acting performances of Pfeiffer and Ford make this movie worth a watch. There are also well-executed creepy atmospheres, signaling the appearances of paranormal activity, especially in the eerie bathtub scene.The film keeps the audience guessing if there is really something supernatural going on or some kind of explainable phenomenon.

34,sddavis63,Totally Predictable,4,8 August 2001,"A rather mundane and totally predictable story of a woman haunted. There wasn't very much original to be found. Doors opening and closing by themselves, lights and other appliances going on and off for no reason. YAWN! Considering this was supposed to be a thriller, there wasn't even very much suspense to be found until the last twenty minutes or so, and then the whole thing got bogged down into something that vaguely resembled a slasher movie (""Look! He just won't die!"")I watched this on the strength of Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Pfeiffer was all right playing the haunted woman, but I thought Ford, who never really (in my opinion) seemed to capture his character, was a bit of a disappointment. He moved away from the ""good guy"" roles he's generally played but didn't handle it especially well.In any event I had the ending to this thing figured out fairly quickly, and nothing that happened in the movie even caused me to question my guess for a moment. That does not make a good suspense movie. It wasn't a disaster, just a disappointment that I rate as a 4/10.",What Lies Beneath

Thank goodness I bought this DVD cheap, I would have felt so criminally cheated if I had paid full price for it. Never before has 2 hours seemed so unfathomably long. Every tedious minute is dragged out and every second is felt. This wouldn't be so bad if the plot and story were bearable but the whole thing is so full of holes and embarrassing contrivances that it becomes too hard to swallow. For such a long, drawn-out and tedious affair to have a boring, tension-free ending is unreal. Considering the talent behind this film it's strange for it to be so bad.

All of a sudden, strange things start to happen at home, including doors opening on their own, damp floors, faucets left on while lights go out and the general ""feeling"" that someone is watching.

But, he doesn't really calm his lovely wife and, with the arrival of strange new neighbors, Claire is doubly spooked. As she searches for evidence of her own sanity, Claire stumbles upon secrets that involve Norman and a former student. Just what lies beneath the surface of a longtime married couple's relationship? This is a truly eerie film, with a great deal of dripping water, faces in mirrors, and bathtub frights. It has been said that this film does for tubs what Psycho did for showers and its true! Pfeiffer and Ford make one truly great acting duo, although fans of Ford may be surprised at his choice of roles. The supporting cast is fine, too.

42,zkonedog,Extremely Underrated Zemeckis Thriller,10,3 March 2017,"The first time I watched ""What Lies Beneath"", I was completely blown away by its engaging plot, mysterious atmosphere, and well-acted characters. Even after repeated viewings I can still enjoy the well-crafted narrative, picking up something new every watch-through.For a very basic overview, this movie sees Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Norman (Harrison Ford) Spencer send their only daughter off to college. Now in an ""empty nest"", Claire begins to hear voices, sense a presence, and witness many strange things happening around the house and with the neighbors. She may even be seeing ghosts, of a sort. Is she going a bit loopy...or is something supernatural really transpiring?I am a huge fan of mystery, and this film has that in spades. Robert Zemeckis is a master director, so he knows exactly how to craft a movie with the right kind of pacing to fully suck the viewer into the lives of Claire and Norman. Not until the final few minutes of the movie do you know exactly what is going on, and it's a perfect buildup to get there.Upon a very recent viewing, I was blown away by how many spot-on ""housewife dominated by successful husband"" themes are present here. Though ostensibly a thriller/mystery, it is also a treatise on the power structure between the two leads. Let's just say that the ""What Lies Beneath"" title could refer as much to matters domestic as to those paranormal.To that end, the casting is utterly perfect. Pfeiffer absolutely personifies the ""meek but knows it"" empty-nester wife, while Ford does the ""too important to be put-upon"" routine to a tee. The chemistry between those two goes a long way in setting up the finale, which I won't spoil here.Also, Zemeckis is quoted as saying (about this film) that he went about it ""as what Alfred Hitchcock might have done with digital technology"". That approach is clearly evident, from the creepy mood music to the use of a bathroom object to elicit terror.Overall, I'm always a bit surprised by the low rankings of this film and its absence from ""best of thrillers"" lists.

It is not a brilliant film, it has flaws, but it seems to me a successful effort. The well-written script, full of twists that add to the mystery and prevent the audience from realizing what is really going on until almost the end, as well as the excellent performances of the main actors, were decisive for the quality of the final result.At first, it looks like a simple mild psychological horror film around another haunted house: Norman and Claire are a middle-aged couple and now live alone, as their daughter went to University. They recovered the family's country house, but Claire will begin to hear voices and have strange and frightening visions, which she quickly relates to a couple of neighbors with somewhat strange behaviors. But the truth is hidden closer than she thinks, and what we thought was a light horror film turns out to be, after all, a very elegant and engaging mystery thriller.The cast is skillfully led by two great actors, who need no introduction nor to prove their talent to anyone: Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. She is totally at ease with her character and is still very beautiful, although she is no longer the young actress of ""Age of Innocence"". Ford gives us an equally solid and fresh work, as it is extraordinarily rare to see this actor not being the good guy. The way in which both actors act together is very positive, full of chemistry and intensity. The supporting characters are guaranteed, with pride and merit, by actors like Diana Scarwid and Katharine Towne.Technically, the film shows the full value of its budget. Skillfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, it has excellent cinematography, with a dark and dense atmosphere, good light and shade and a very restrained, but effective, use of outside scenes. The house is beautiful, and the set is very elegant, as well as the costumes, particularly Pfeiffer's. The film is over two hours in length, and it may seem a little too long, but I confess that I handled it well and didn't feel that it needed many additional cuts. Most of the time, it manages to create the atmosphere and environment necessary for the suspense to work, but this begins to fail as the film moves towards its climax.",What Lies Beneath

47,insomniac_rod,Not your typical drama...,6,19 November 2004,"The movie may work for people that are easily impressed by ghost movies. This is a drama thriller that uses some elements from the horror genre.""What Lies Beneath"" is filled by false scares and mostly relies on it's ""scary"" scenes. The truth is that the movie shouldn't be scary just because some scenes take the audience by surprise. The plot is interesting and actually believable and at some point catches the audience's attention and doesn't lets it go. The movie was sold as a horror movie in the likes of ""The Sixth Sense"" (the movie that awakened the ghost sub-genre) but it's merely a dramatic feature with minimal use of the genre. There's infidelity, betrayal, passion, and madness. Recurring elements in a drama movie.For people that like movies that deal with the supernatural... Yes there are some disturbing images but cannot carry the whole movie. People that like to watch original movies and aren't very used to the horror genre may love this; but die hard horror fans that actually believed in the publicity campaign of the movie won't like it.Special mentions deserve Harrison Ford and the great and always beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer but their good performances. A movie like this always needs solid performances and that's pretty much part of the movies' success.The direction is stylish but not appropriate for this kind of movies that always need an eerie atmosphere.5/10. I'm part of the horror fan database and this movie bored me. In my opinion the movie was an attempt to be a huge box office hit.",What Lies Beneath
48,funkyfry,Possibly the worst suspense movie of all time,2,6 November 2002,"*******SPOILERS********Unfortunately, the opportunity to see this film arose -- I probably never would have bothered if I'd read ""Zemeckis"" on the box.  What can you say about a film so shallow, with so much awful dialogue and a constant failed attempt at suspense?  Good scene involving death fetishism.  Otherwise, a total waste of time for all involved, especially the audience.  The biggest problem is that, although the film does have a genuine surprise in store for the audience, it takes all kinds of time to build up to it, and along the way we're supposed to be in a state of tension half the time.  Zemeckis should know that this is impossible to pull off unless you kind of make a joke of it (like in Dario Argento's ""Tenebre"").... the way it's done here is to just keep the tension until the audience is numbed to the possiblility of suspense.",What Lies Beneath

The story itself flowed easily and both Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford both delivered good performances, but the simplicity of the plot as well as an excessive ending took a lot away from the film. I have to admit that there were times when I jumped during the film, but not many. The story of the neighbors was more interesting to me than the visions that Mrs. Spencer (Pfeiffer) was seeing in the house, and the way that that element of the movie turned out was disappointing. What Lies Beneath is an entertaining enough ghost story, but I think that it would be better to watch at home late at night with a bunch of your buddies. It's not the kind of movie that you would want to spend eight bucks on to see at the theater.",What Lies Beneath

51,bsmith5552,A Thriller in the Hitchcock Tradition!,8,21 May 2001,"In ""What Lies Beneath"", director Robert Zemeckis gives us a thriller that reminds one of the great films made by Alfred Hitchcock. Now don't get me wrong, nobody in my opinion, will ever top the master of suspense. Zemeckis does come close. Without giving too much away, the story revolves around a suburban wife (the ever beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer) who we learn had been in a serious accident months earlier. She begins ""to see things"" and despite support from her husband (Harrison Ford) and friends, wonders what really is happening, has happened or will happen. Zemeckis gives us such plot elements such as things that go bump in the night, visions that only the Pfeiffer character can see, mysterious next door neighbors, a ouija board, the doubting husband and the loyal friend. This works pretty well in the first half of the movie, but because ""What Lies Beneath"" is essentially a two character story, events in the second half are often telegraphed before they happen. Pfieffer and Ford are very good in their roles (as always). I do think though, that more involvement from the supporting cast would have heightened the mystery. But all in all, ""What Lies Beneath"" is a very good movie.",What Lies Beneath
52,dfranzen70,Chill 'er up,9,13 February 2001,"Both Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer have had tremendous careers, filled with success both artistic and financial. Both are A-list stars, among the most bankable in Hollywood. And director Robert Zemeckis is no slouch either, having helmed (among others) such Tom Hanks vehicles as Forrest Gump and Cast Away. You wouldn't think such a cast and director would deign to be in a horror film, albeit one with a sizable budget, but here they are, in this wonderful, captivating thriller.Claire (Pfeiffer) and Norman (Ford) are a well-to-do married couple living on a somewhat palacial lakeside estate in Vermont. Norman's a research scientist and spends much of his time finishing papers and giving lectures while Claire stays at home, dealing with the emotional aftereffects of a recent car crash.Norman has a stepdaughter, Caitlin, who goes off to college at the beginning of the movie. For the first time in years, Claire is alone in the house, and she notices strange things afoot. She experiences some strange phenomena, including a woman's reflection in her bathwater. The fragile Claire is convinced the disturbances have something to do with the strange couple next door, and urges her husband to look into the matter. He finds nothing, of course, and asks her to see a therapist, thinking that his lovely wife is still unstable.But the therapist recommends contacting whatever might be causing the disturbances, and that's when the fun begins. Is this a typical haunted house story? Assuredly not, dear friend. The people in the house are not killed off one by one until the Hero and Heroine face the Ghost in a Bull Run standoff. This is a fascinating thriller, with the audience with Claire all the way. There are more twists to this plot than in the typical tax form. Many screenwriters keep horror/thriller plots as simple as possible to avoid confusion and to avoid stepping on their own toes. Sarah Kernochan and Clark Gregg do not take any shortcuts here, though. Every turn is a hair-raising ride; every other scene is jaw-dropping. It would be easy to throw in everything but the kitchen sink, but when that happens you have a plot filled with nonsequiturs. Not so here, folks. You know how sometimes critics tell you not to look too closely at the plot, because then the holes show through? Go ahead, I dare you to look closely at this one.Zemeckis directed this while he was on hiatus from Cast Away (which was necessary so Tom Hanks could get in the right shape for the rest of the movie). Some people mock Zemeckis for being simply a director of films that simply appeal to the masses; he's criticized for being successful despite himself. His work here, however, shows how talented he really is. For example, many directors rely on loud soundtracks to ""sell"" their blockbuster films. But in What Lies Beneath, Zemeckis made great use of the ultimate sound - silence. And that's how you make a creepy movie, folks. The guys behind The Blair Witch Project knew it, too. What you DON'T see in a movie is always scarier than what you DO see. And with no sound, the eeriness factor grows exponentially.This certainly makes it onto the list of my favorite films of the year. You gotta see this!",What Lies Beneath

The movie develops as eminent geneticist (Harrison Ford) struggles to keep things on an even keel in their country mansion as his beautiful wife starts ""seeing things.""The style is that of Hitchcock without being Hitchcock. Seriously flawed, but not so that the average filmgoer will complain too much or want their money back, What Lies Beneath reaches blockbuster status without quite managing to transcend it. Zemeckis relies on the supernatural to play to the audience, which means the plot can go anywhere and doesn't have to tie up logically. Unfortunately the trailers gave most of the plot away, which robbed the story of any dramatic unfolding.

The music score is beautiful by the great Alan Silvestri who has done many of my favourite scores from many of my favourite films that i grew up on such as Predator, Predator 2, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Judgment Night, Death Becomes Her & many more, the man is a musical genius who really sets the moods to his movies & always delivers such beautifully memorable scores.
This thrilling Suspenseful Thriller has a supernatural twist mixed in & works perfectly for it's creepy story & a very well done spooky atmosphere.Michelle Pfeiffer (Batman Returns) stars as Claire, an older lady who has just said bye to her beloved teenage daughter who has gone to college & she is left in her & her husbands huge mansion like house that is beautiful & creepy at the same time, she seems very lonely & is always at home & things get weird.
Pfeiffer is really good in her role & the best I've seen her act & she really gets into her role & is believable.
Another Hollywood great Harrison Ford stars as Claire's Big time rich Doctor, Dr. Norman Spencer & he's a man who lives for his work & is always busy & working late & that leaves his wife feeling alone & isolated from him. Ford is good as Norman & puts in a good performance & comes off often is abit weird & as the film goes on we realise he has some dark secrets. Now this is a very well done Supernatural Thriller with amazing production design like the huge house & there's plenty of great set-pieces & it oozes spooky atmosphere & the side characters are just as good here such as Claire's best friend who is a hippy type who is into all sorts of interesting things like seance & occult & special herbal type teas, she a great character who i personally liked the best in the whole movie, DIANA SCARWID as JODY, a really interesting & funny character who steals the scenes she's in.

58,noralee,Scary But Riddled With Clichés,5,21 December 2005,"""What Lies Beneath"" tries SO hard to be Hitchcockian. Well, I've been watching Hitchcock again and this ain't no Hitchcock.It's a grown-up ""Scream"" for adults, what with mature co-stars in Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford. Director Robert Zemeckis uses every cliché shot in the book, every expected trick, and gosh it still grabs us.But every time the audience screams -- and we did, a lot--we immediately all burst out laughing at the ""gotcha!"". It's the kind of movie that the audience narrates out loud as if doing closed captioning for the blind- ""Oh look, the door's open!"" ""Oh she found a key!"" ""Oh the bath tub's full again!""Hitchcock did it all already and better -- the shower in ""Psycho,"" the taking on of a ghostly identity in ""Vertigo,"" the quotidian being the scariest of all (a playground in ""The Birds"" --gosh one of the most frightening scenes on screen--and a kitchen murder in ""Torn Curtain"" etc. etc.)It's a roller coaster ride in a water park that you go on to enjoy being scared at because you know it's going to go downhill underwater fast.

59,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Nice slice of eerie domestic terror,8,21 November 2015,"Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath, although a bit melodramatic at times, is a nicely freaky bit of domestic terror, in the vein of Hitchcock. It's a pseudo supernatural thriller that I saw at a very young age, so I have a spooky nostalgia for it, as it scared me in that way that only kids can get, staying with you even as you get older and making whatever film it was that made you feel that way resonate unconditionally for you. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer play an affluent married couple who are beset by strange paranormal phenomena that may or may not be linked to one of their pasts. Ford is a busy medical professional, away for days at a time working, Pfeiffer the stay at home wife, plagued by creepy voices, noises and bumps in the night when alone in their large mansion, in some nice eerie sequences. Clues lead her to the odd job couple living next door (James Remar and Miranda Otto) but soon it becomes clear the answers won't be as easy or obvious as that, and the cold, clinical nastiness of a thriller that knows what it's doing and won't compromise sets in, freezing us in our seats for a nice jarring third act of unexpected resolution that lets the actors go to some places they haven't ventured in their careers. Ford is calm, cool and barely connected, Pfeiffer is detached and perplexed, and there's fun work from Wendy Crewson, Joe Morton and a ghostly Amber Valetta as well. The dog making a nasty discovery in the backyard pond is a nice moment for me, one I had dreams about for a while after seeing this at probably an all too young age. A nice little package of a thriller; cold, classy, frightening.",What Lies Beneath
60,drownnnsoda,"Eerie, Engrossing Thriller From Robert Zemeckis.",9,23 July 2007,"""What Lies Beneath"" is an engrossing, Hitchcockian horror mystery that centers on Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer), who is happily married to Doctor Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford). Her daughter, Caitlin leaves for college, leaving a somewhat saddened Claire alone in her large lake-side home alone most of the time while Norman is busy with his work. As Claire spends more time alone in her house, she begins to suspect a ghost may be inhabiting her home after a number of odd occurrences... but could the ghost be linked to the neighboring couple, whom which Claire has had some very strange experiences. Or could the spirit be more close to home? A tightly-scripted and well-paced horror mystery, ""What Lies Beneath"" is one of the more recent, slow-going and old fashioned horror movies to be released. I enjoyed this movie a lot, and I remember watching it when it was first released and being very scared of it. It still holds up as a scary movie, even though I've gotten older, and still gets a few good jolts out of me. The strange thing about this movie is that it starts off like your conventional haunted house tale, minus the fact that our protagonist has already lived in the house for a number of years and never experienced anything out of the ordinary. Aside from that, it seems like it will be your typical ghost movie, but the catch is that it doesn't really give you much to go on for the first half of the movie. It keeps the core of the plot shrouded in mystery, while progressing towards it's revelation.Very good work from the writers here, the story is well-told and provides a sufficient amount of shocks and some creepy moments amidst a spooky atmosphere. I think the story is effective because the supernatural occurrences begin happening out of the blue - what if you're home, which you've happily lived in, suddenly becomes a terrifying place? That premise is frightening. Is Claire going crazy? Or is there really a ghost? This idea reminds me quite a bit of the 1971 horror film, ""Let's Scare Jessica To Death"", which has a similar story and setting. Exceptional acting here from Michelle Pfeiffer as our lead, she conveys an emotionally crumbling woman who is dealing with the supernatural, and Harrison Ford plays her loving but lost husband. Cinematography is very nice here, and the film looks spectacular. When the film reaches it's surprising climax, you will most definitely be on the edge of your seat.Overall, ""What Lies Beneath"" is an excellent, first-rate horror mystery that is much better than most of the recent horror junk. Strong acting from Pfeiffer and Ford, plus a very suspenseful and eerie story, and some excellent scare scenes make this a must-see for genre fans. And for those who think a PG-13 rating means bad news, don't worry - this movie is excellent, the rating here really means nothing, it's much scarier than you would assume. I'd strongly recommend this film for anyone wanting to experience a solid suspense movie. 9/10.",What Lies Beneath

I mean she just fits the role so well and really rocks it! And Harrison Ford is great here, he is determined, dramatic, and even scary at times. The suspense and tense energy that runs rampant thought what lies beneath is incredible, it's so creepy and unwatchable at times. Just the music itself will creep underneath your skin. Robert Zemeckis has done it again, he successfully made an entertaining, well acted and well written creepy thriller. Also Pfeiffer and Ford do have good on screen chemistry together, they just work and click during a scene, especially an intimate one. The visuals are great here, and the film is directed and shot very well, great to look at. The script is well written with intelligent dialogue between the main characters. The ending is very satisfying, I liked it, it is creepy, smart, and bone chilling. It's not exactly a big twist, but just a little one.

Is she dead? Or is her husband a schemer. He certainly seems the sort, being one of those ""too level headed"" to trust sorts, which people who have been around do know better than to trust.Is the woman dead? Or is she playing games.Or is the wife simply having a ""Mirage"" like Peck did? In fact, that is where it seems to be headed most of the time. Did she go off the deep end and kill her husband's lover, then forget it? There are a few other red herrings, but it is obvious that they are red herrings.

64,ferbs54,Claire And Present Danger,8,22 October 2012,"Robert Zemeckis, by dint of such phenomenally popular films as ""Romancing the Stone,"" ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?,"" the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, ""Death Becomes Her,"" ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Contact,"" was already a highly successful Hollywood director when, along with producers Steve Starkey and Jack Rapke, he formed the ImageMovers production company in 1998. As the company's first project, Zemeckis chose screenwriter Clark Gregg's ""What Lies Beneath,"" a modern-day ghost story that, the director told his crew, he wished to bring to the screen as Alfred Hitchcock might have done, IF the Master of Suspense had had access to modern FX technology and computer graphics. (Never mind that none of Hitchcock's 54 films dealt with ghosts or the supernatural per se.) Filmed largely in the Lake Champlain region of Vermont, near Addison, during a hiatus from shooting ""Cast Away,"" the resultant picture, released in July 2000, was still another significant feather in Zemeckis' already crowded hat, and, like those other films named, features impressive yet subtly integrated FX to complement a highly intriguing story. As both a horror film and an exercise in suspense, ""What Lies Beneath"" must be deemed a complete success.In the picture, we meet an attractive, middle-aged couple, Norman and Claire Spencer, and indeed, as portrayed by Hollywood icons Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, the Spencers might be one of the handsomest couples in the history of the horror film! Living as they do in a beautiful home overlooking a Vermont lake, the professional couple (Norman is a renowned geneticist; Claire, a retired cellist), although their only daughter has just left for college, would seem to have an enviable marriage. But before very long, weird occurrences begin in the newly ""empty nest."" Strange noises and whisperings, a broken picture frame, spectral reflections in the surface of the lake and (in perhaps the film's single scariest scene) bathtub water, all serve to convince Claire that the ghost of a young woman is haunting her abode...possibly the ghost of her new next-door neighbor, who Claire believes has been killed by her husband. But, as it turns out, the truth is considerably more complex, and the unraveling of this truth will go very far in unraveling the Spencers' marriage, too....So, DOES ""What Lies Beneath"" strike the viewer as a Hitchcockian exercise, abetted by 21st century computer wizardry? I would have to say yes. There are any number of scenes that are undeniably scary or suspenseful, the most agonizing of which is the wonderful scene in which Claire lies paralyzed in a bathtub that is slowly being filled with water. Some of Alan Silvestri's score is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann's classic music for ""Psycho,"" while Claire's use of binoculars to spy on her neighbors at night cannot help but call to mind Jimmy Stewart in ""Rear Window."" Pfeiffer and Ford work well together and do have some screen chemistry; they make a credible couple, although Norman, as it turns out, might be one of the least sympathetic characters that Ford has ever essayed. For this viewer, however, the bulk of this picture's success must lie squarely with Pfeiffer, who appears in virtually every single scene and is simply terrific in all of them. Watching her in this film, in which she easily displays far more dramatic heft than her costar, and also reveals what an effective ""scream queen"" she can be, the viewer will most likely regret how few other horror vehicles Ms. Pfeiffer has appeared in. And really, besides 1994's ""Wolf,"" I can think of no others, unless we stretch the point a bit and include 1987's ""The Witches of Eastwick"" and this past summer's horror comedy ""Dark Shadows."" One of the finest combinations of sensational looks and undeniable acting chops to this day (and Michelle is 54 as I write these words), she is quite simply one of the best we've got, and makes Claire Spencer and ""What Lies Beneath"" a character and a film to savor. The venerable ""Leonard Maltin Movie Guide,"" apparently, does not concur in this assessment, concluding its lukewarm comments with the statement that the story ""doesn't make sense."" But the film DID make perfect sense to me...as long, that is, as one is willing to believe in spooks. And by the end of Zemeckis' highly effective film, most viewers, I have a feeling, will be uttering that famous line of the Cowardly Lion: ""I DO believe in spooks, I DO believe in spooks, I do, I do, I do, I do, I DO believe in spooks....""",What Lies Beneath
65,aidanratesmovies,Solid Thriller- Pfeiffer is as good as ever,8,5 June 2021,"A slow-building thriller with some excellent performances- What Lies Beneath may take a little while to find its footing- but in the end, still proves to be a rather taut and smart little horror thriller. Robert Zemeckis- the acclaimed director of such classic films as Cast Away and Back to the Future directed this film- and I have to say it doesn't feel like one of his movies. Zemeckis directed the film in between shootings for Cast Away and I think largely that contributed to the somewhat bland tone of the film. Not that the film is bad visually or atmospherically, there are some interesting shots throughout and plenty of suspenseful moments, but there is just such a blandless to the color palate and look of the film itself that I feel could have totally enhanced the experience. The pacing can be a bit slow at first, but the farther we get into the plot, the better it gets. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding in her lead role alongside veteran actor Harrison Ford- who I did feel was rather decent as well. The music in the film is well done, as always, and the script is incredibly clever and well written- one of those mysteries that will have you guessing until the very end- something i'm a huge fan of. Not only that, but the film itself is incredibly detailed and way smarter than it seems- which is refreshing given its rather light start. In the end, What Lies Beneath is a solid mystery thriller with a dabble of horror. It may not have reached all of its potential, but what resulted is still something to be proud of.My Rating: 8.5/10.",What Lies Beneath

68,davidmvining,Zemeckis Channels Hitchcock,6,23 November 2020,"Famously made in the year long production break on Cast Away designed to give Tom Hanks enough time to slim down for the second half of that film, What Lies Beneath is a trifle in Robert Zemeckis' filmography. It's an homage to Hitchcock that ends up feeling surprisingly generic as it continues, but the whole thing is buoyed by Zemeckis' sheer talent as he imbues every big scene with enough style and suspense that it's almost enough to make up for the movie's generic nature. Almost.Claire is a housewife to an academic geneticist and they send their daughter off to college leaving an empty nest. With little to do but putz around the newly renovated house that Norman inherited from his father and spy on the new neighbors, it's obvious that Claire is going to go a bit stir crazy. She starts seeing things, the most present of which deals with those new neighbors. They haven't met, but the wife frantically begs Claire for help through the fence before she disappears. Convinced of murder, Claire shares her theory with Norman who dismisses her completely. It becomes a short Rear Window homage as Claire watches the husband through binoculars, convinced of his guilt.At the same time, she sees things that are even less tangible, like a dead girl in her bathroom. In the mirror, in the water of the tub that fills mysteriously, amidst the steam of the hot water, the blond girl that resembles Claire a fair amount just keeps popping up. That's crazy, right? She's convinced that it's the wife next door, so convinced that when she sees the husband coming out of a public venue one night, she barges up to him and demands to know how he killed his wife before he pulls his living wife into the conversation. Embarrassed, Norman leads Claire away.And yet, the ghost is still there, so, given a clue from the ghost herself, her initials, Claire finds a matching name on Vermont's list of missing persons and visits the girl's mother. Madison was a student, a partier, and a good girl, but she just disappeared one day. It turns out that Madison and Norman had a connection, and the trailers gave it away completely. So, I'm not going to worry about giving it away here.Norman had an affair with Madison and may have had something to do with her disappearance. Up to this point, the movie is a fine little supernatural thriller. It's well built with very good moments of tension, but the movie strings us along on a lie that I'm not sure any in the audience believes, that Norman didn't kill Madison. The second he backtracks on something he had said before, it's obvious that he did it. You don't write characters who lie and then lie about a lie to have them stop one step shy of being a killer in a movie about a dead girl. No, he's the killer. He's going to lie about it, and the movie tries to make the most of the idea that he didn't kill her after we've figured it out for about a half hour. It's a frustrating section of the film, and it really drags it down, killing a lot of the tension that should be there.When the movie finally moves past that lie and lets us know that what we've known for half an hour is actually true, that Norman is a liar, then the movie picks back up again. Oh, that's not to say that there isn't good stuff in that half hour. When Claire uses a book given to her by a friend and a lock of hair she stole from Madison's house to allow Madison's ghost to possess her, it's a titillating moment for sure, but the underlying tension isn't there. But the movie feels a bit deflated until Norman reveals himself to Claire, and it's a solid twenty minutes of building tension that works incredibly well because of the intelligent approach Zemeckis brings.The height of it really is when Claire is catatonic in the bathtub as the water slowly rises up to her mouth, eventually over her nose, and she needs to use her limited physical movement as her body slowly wakes up to try and save herself with the plug in the drain. It's done without music, just the sound of the water rising, and it's the kind of sequence that Hitchcock did in his sleep. The rest of the movie's climax is a series of really inventive visual effects shots, the sorts of things you wouldn't expect from a movie like this but would from Robert Zemeckis, and it all culminates in a solid denouement. It's not great, but the ending does end up working pretty well.I just mostly wish that the central mystery was actually, you know, a mystery. That half hour where we know what's going to happen but the movie thinks we don't feel like such a drag on everything else around it, and everything else around it is solidly fine, not great. As I said in the beginning, it's kind of a generic Hitchcock throwback film. It makes sense as a smaller project that Zemeckis could throw together in the hole in his schedule that was the middle of Cast Away's production, but it makes less sense as a project that held a lot that attracted Zemeckis to the project. The Hitchcock homage angle makes sense as well, but there's a problem in the script that feels like might have gotten addressed if Zemeckis had had more time to work on it.Still, it's not really a bad film at all. It's opening hour and final twenty minutes work quite well, but there's that section that just drags it all down too much. I also feel like the empty nest stuff in the beginning just gets largely forgotten by the end, leaving a healthy thematic avenue unexplored. Oh well. It could have been worse.",What Lies Beneath
69,triple8,"Oh Please, the cliché",4,12 August 2003,"I didn't like this movie and with Pfeifer and Ford as the leads I was betting this would be a 10. What lies beneath, which looked great in the previews, was yawn provoking. It was absolutely predictable, conforms to every cliché a movie can conform to including but not limited to: predictable story lines, corny chase scenes, run of the mill scare tactics, long drawn out ending and a dull, overused plot-I think the two leads did this film because they knew it would be a hit-I thought the movie had a lot of creative paths to take then the one it ultimately wound up taking. There is not one original thing, that I could find, about this thriller and though I found it watchable, there were so many clichés involved in the movie, Particularly the ending, and so many places it could have really shone in a more creative way,(especially with the talent involved) that I was disappointed and a bit baffled as to why this movie went by the wayside of the ever predictable.I don't get why so many thrillers all end the same or use the same old tired tricks-two great talents-Ford and Pfeifer-Ford was given more to do then Pfifer,who gets chased a lot, but I still left the theater feeling Unsatisfied. My vote is a 4, main reason I didn't give it under a 4 is because Ford really did some good acting and so actually, did Pfeiffer which is the best thing about the movie-the talent. Great talent involved in a watchable but very predictable movie.",What Lies Beneath
70,Sherazade,The film that inspired the Hindi version 'Raaz',7,8 April 2006,"Though it's not as scary or as in-depth as its Hindi counterpart, What Lies Beneath still manages to pack a decent punch. Michelle Pfeiffer (in the Bipasha Basu role) plays the wife of Harrison Ford (in the Dino Morea role) and just like in Raaz, certain little things begin to occur that lead her to believe that everything is not all together right in her life and that of her husband's. Their house and the lake behind it seem haunted but instead of driving herself insane like Bips, she begins her investigation right away. One main different between the two films I am comparing with one another is that, when the truth comes out, unlike Ford, Morea's character doesn't turn on his wife. I guess this can be chucked up the differences between cultures and norms. Oh! and instead of the mad woman from Raaz, here she is a college student (played by supermodel and arguably the most talented of all the ""recently-turned-actress models"" Amber Valleta).",What Lies Beneath
71,raulfaust,What Lies and Scares,7,13 November 2011,"Recently I've been seeing several suspense movies because it's my favorite genre, but I was having trouble in finding a decent one. Well, ""What Lies Beneath"" surely goes to the decent list. The photography direction is wonderful, I didn't think a 2000's movie could be that beautiful and well colored as this one. I have to point that this is one of the strongest suspenses I've seen, Robert Zemeckis is congratulated for being so professional and competent in this work; he really knows how to build the atmosphere and surprise the spectator whenever he wants to. The one thing I didn't like much was the story; I found it to be a little pointless and too weak at times, but surely it doesn't spoil the film's overall quality. And also, I wish I could understand why Claire wouldn't move in the bath when she was drowning, why didn't she move, tried to get up or anything? She just got paralyzed and moved her feet, instead of getting up and running away.Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford are really good in this picture and I hope they did that well in all the movies they were in-- sadly, that's not what happened. See ""What Lies Beneath"" expecting for a great suspenseful thriller and you'll get what you want.",What Lies Beneath
72,philip_vanderveken,"Sometimes a bit unbelievable, but it has some good things to offer as well.",7,11 March 2005,"It seems to me that many people don't like this movie only because it reminds them too much of what Hitchcock made in his time. Personally I'm not too familiar with Hitchcock's work (although I know ""Psycho"", ""Rear Window"" and ""The Birds"", but who doesn't?), but if it is true that the movie is full of references to the Master of Suspense's movies, than I guess the man himself might have liked it. Personally I would see it as an honor if they made an homage to my work and I definitely wouldn't immediately call it a rip-off like some people over here do.The story in this movie is very nice. It starts with showing us a family (man, wife and daughter) that is about to change. The daughter will soon move out of the house because she is going to college. Of course you know what this will do to the mother. She suffers from the empty-nest syndrome and even starts to see things that aren't actually there. But gradually she finds out that she isn't going insane and that her husband has kept a terrible secret for her...I liked the performances by Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer a lot, but than again, what else but a fine performance can you expect if you are talking about these two actors. The other actors also did a very good job and yet the movie didn't entirely convince me. I sometimes wondered if the director really had a good plan of where he was going with this movie. Sometimes I had the feeling it was a bit messy, but most of all, a bit unbelievable (for instance when Claire stands at the water with a bit of the girl's hair in her hands and then is drawn to the bottom of the lake by it). Nevertheless, this is still a fine thriller that offers some good suspense, a good story and some nice acting. That's why I give it a 7/10.",What Lies Beneath

The picture and the set were superb to create the chilling atmosphere. Another proof how suspense can live up without many action or bombs. There were some scenes à la Hitchcock that gave to the movie the last touch of an excellent horror mystery thriller. I wish that Hollywood will produce in future more pearls like this one. ""What Lies Beneath"" will find a place in my DVD collection. On IMDB the vote is too low, our vote: 8,5/10.",What Lies Beneath
74,fntstcplnt,What Lies Beneath (2000),4,10 January 2020,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford, Diana Scarvid, Joe Morton, Miranda Otto, James Remar, Ray Baker, Wendy Crewson. (PG-13)Daughter off to college and husband (Ford) working long hours, Pfeiffer has plenty of time in their large lakeside house to let her imagination run away with her, especially when doors keep opening and bathtubs fill themselves up. Is it all in her head or is she being haunted by a g-g-g-g-ghost? Cross between a Hitchcockian psychological suspenser and a supernatural horror movie employs the usual ghost-with-a-grudge jump-scare tactics with competence but little ingenuity or verve. The storyline not only distorts its characters in unnatural and disappointing ways, but also gets increasingly ridiculous once the red herring sub-plot is discarded, leading to a series of overextended pseudo-climaxes so unfulfilling that it's rather stunning when the setting suddenly changes to indicate the denouement has begun. Actors do their best (even when required to speak and act in bewildering fashion) and the slow build is sometimes effective, but its ultimate effect is hollow, an experience that disappears as quickly as the ghostly apparitions.40/100",What Lies Beneath

Besides the fact that it has little or no bearing on the true plot of the movie,but the amount of time devoted TO that MacGuffin is so tedious that it feels as if the director,producers and the advertising execs pushing this film weren't on the same page.I seem to have been the only one(at least if you went by the comments I've skimmed so far on this site)to noticed.Director Robert Zemekis wants(stress WANTS)to make a Hitchcock-like thriller:he half succeeds in that he creates good mood and tension,but he fails miserably in making a slow,long,tedious and aggravating film where the plot takes WAY too much time to establish and the action to get rolling.

77,Maciste_Brother,A movie only a Blonde can like!,3,3 February 2003,"SpoilersWHAT LIES BENEATH is one silly movie. So silly that you have to be Blonde to actually enjoy it. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this.Folks, this is a mystery/thriller/ghost story, right? Okay, so let's go through a simple step by step process to show how dumb this movie is.Q: Who stars in WHAT LIES BENEATH? A: Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer.Q; Anyone else?A; Yes, there's Diana Scarwid but her role is negligible, so there's almost no point of mentioning her.Q; Anyone else?A; Well, there are other actors but the movie is basically populated by two characters played by Ford and Pfeiffer.Q: But this is a mystery thriller? If there are only two people in the movie, how difficult is it to figure out the mystery and who the murderer is?A: EXACTLY!!!!God, I never seen such a dumb movie. Mystery thrillers NEED a good number of characters populating the story in order to work properly. If a movie like WHAT LIES BENEATH only shows two characters for two hours, where the hell is the mystery? One of the two HAS to be the killer. And it's not Michelle Pfeiffer. So that leaves...huh, you know who.Whoever wrote this script must have an I.Q. of 40. Every fundamental aspect about thrillers is missing. The fact that the film spends almost all of its entire very long two hours on two characters might have worked IF the script had been character driven. Sorta like a cat and mouse game where one tries to outwit the other. Unfortunately, because WLB is a mystery thriller, the whole story about the dead woman and who killed her has to remain unknown for most of the film in order for it to be effective as a mystery. But the story is PATENTLY obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence because we're dealing with only two characters here. Had it been a character driven film, the identity of the killer would have been known to the audience from the beginning and then the cat and mouse action would have taken most of the film's time. But  WHAT LIES BENEATH is not a character driven film. It's a mystery driven film that's a mystery only to one character in the movie. WLB is like a mystery where the audience knows who the killer is except for the film itself. The film is in total denial. And for two very long hours, we watch this aborted exercise in stilted dialogue and acting from both Ford and Pfeiffer who go through the painfully cliched motion of a mystery that's been D.O.A. from the beginning and stretched out until the over-the-top ending. What's even more incredible is that the film was shot on location in Vermont. And yet the only thing you see during the entire movie are close-ups of Pfeiffer and Ford(who looks terrible). What's the point of shooting a movie on location if you're simply going to end up showing  faces of the actors? Robert Zemeckis' direction is the real mystery in WLB.What a waste!",What Lies Beneath
78,kevin c,HITCHCOCK IT AIN'T,5,11 December 2000,"A good opening 60 minutes that loses it's way, and underlines that you should always keep your ghost off-screen. Pfeiffer is good, and helps to sustain the early tension and suspense. Ford is hardly in it, and then when he becomes the bad guy (sorry) is so one dimensional. The Hitchcock references are blatant and sometimes laughable. However, compared to the usual Hollywood popcorn fare it's okay.

Michelle Pfeiffer is especially good in this and deserves all the praise she can get. Her performance makes this film a treat for genuine horror fans.

The more I heard about the movie, the more worried I became. It looked to be a Fatal Attraction with ghosts.And actually, it is, but I was surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did. It certainly is a very standard telling of a ghostly revenge story. No fancy camera work or plot lines. If you don't figure it out by the halfway point of the movie you've been napping. But the director and actors do a very commendable job in putting on the show. There are few of the off-screen jumps, transparent red-herrings or over the top acting that sink many a thriller. You feel that the movie-making is in very capable hands.  If you've already seen the Class-of-1999 entrants mentioned above and are still hungry for a decent scare, this will do in a pinch.",What Lies Beneath
81,Bob-45,WHAT LIES BENEATH? A Near Masterpiece,9,23 July 2000,"I went into see WHAT LIES BENEATH with few expectations. I'd read the early reviews and seen the trailer.  I'd heardHarrison Ford was considered ""washed up"" and was probably slumming with this one. I figured I knew what the film was about.  Through the first hour I was fairly entertained but began to believe my fears were justified.  In several scenes director Robert Zemeckis hardly moves a camera.  I was beginning to wonder if I were watching a Mike Nichols movie?  However, the second hour of this movie really grabbed me.  I walked out of the theater highly impressed.  This was an even thrill ride than THE SIXTH SENSE.That is NOT to say the film is without its flaws.  The subplot involving the married couple next door goes on WAY too long and undercuts the focus on some key story elements.  However, if that subplot had been deleted we would have missed the most fun scene in the movie between James Remar and the gal playing his wife when they were at the party.The acting is all VERY good.  Neither Pfeiffer nor Ford have EVER been better.I don't usually do this, but it was also fun guessing the film's to which writers Sarah Kernochan and Clark Gregg play homage. I figure the list includes PSYCHO (of course), THE SHINING,NIGHT OF THE HUNTER and THE RED HOUSE.  I'm sure there's others; but, as I said, I'm not into that game.Genre films the quality of WHAT LIES BENEATH don't come along often.  THE SIXTH SENSE, SE7EN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (at least the first half, anyway), SEA OF LOVE, TIGHTROPE, THE OTHER, THE HAUNTING, THE UNIVITED, NIGHT OF THE HUNTER, THE RED HOUSE, PSYCHO, VERTIGO, AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. That's pretty well it.It appears the critical knives are out for this movie.  Oh well, at least half the films on the above list were not appreciated at the time of their release.

82,stamper,A fairly good thriller with just one flaw which seriously damages the film,7,15 January 2001,"What lies beneath, is a thriller of the highest quality one must almost think after seeing who is involved in the film. Michelle Pfeiffer, Harrison Ford and Robert Zemeckis as the director. Plus it is produced by a firm partially owned and also funded by Steven Spielberg. Wow, how can this be bad I asked myself before I went to see it, but I had no answer. When I had watched it and asked myself that again, I knew the answer.
When you watch this film, you really can see that there was a lot of effort made here, to make an entertaining movie. The acting was good, especially from Ford whom I have never seen so good as in this movie. But maybe that was only in my imagination, because this is somewhat a Ford untypical movie. Further I must really say that the things Zemeckis or the cameraguy did with the cameras was amazing. I mean if I was in charge of Oscars by myself I would give an Oscar here for Best Cinematography. On top of that came a really good story which by itself was really inventive and always surprising, plus it was filled with a couple of scares every thriller of this kind needs. And that, the scares department is exactly where the mistake in the movie is made. The supposedly' scary scenes are just too predictable at times, mostly because they are too cliché and have been used too often. Other times I just knew what was going to happen and that is something that is very subjective and therefore I think not everyone will think the same way as I do here, because I think there must be a big fat minus be given to this film due to the predictability. This all does not mean there are no scares to me, they are actually a few, I have not seen yet and which really had me jumping out of my seat.
At last, there is something I want to say about the ending here. I have heard a bunch of friends and critics on TV or so say that the ending of this movie was not good. Well, sorry but that is not true. I mean if you go there expecting a normal thriller you might be disappointed in some of the events, but if you know that this is a ghost story (most of the time) and you therefore know, supernatural or impossible things will happen it is a perfectly good ending.

83,The_Movie_Cat,So-So Psycho,5,21 November 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS (BUT SO DOES THE TRAILER...)
What Lies Beneath is a commendable attempt to bring back the suspense thriller without the cinema's current fascination with computer effects. Some CGI is evident, though minimal, and helps enhance the film, rather than become it. That said, What Lies Beneath, while a nice try, never quite becomes first rate.The major sticking point is the trailer; already being touted as one of the worst trailers ever made. This was especially expounded upon by the idiotic cinema I went to where they actually showed the trailer for the film that was about to be screened - cue lots of people going ""Eh? Have we come into the wrong film?"" For a movie that relies on the twists and turns of its plot to maintain interest, this one botches it by having major plot points, even up to a 100 minutes into the film, revealed to prospective audiences. So when Michelle Pfeiffer discovers her husband has had an affair and the girl died in her house, you're just left thinking ""Yeah, I already know - catch up, you dozy bint!""Apparently Pfeiffer suffered a severe back injury after this film was completed - she'd spent two hours carrying Harrison Ford. Bored Ford sometimes makes the most of his lugubrious nature (as in the superb Blade Runner), but here he's half-asleep. The only time he strikes up interest is when he does a Ghostbusters gag, and when he takes Michelle to a village called Adamant. Though that's only cos I wanted someone to look at the sign and go ""Didn't he have a top five hit with 'Stand and Deliver'?""""Scares"", such as they are, are thoroughly predictable. Pfeiffer looks through a hole in the fence, only to see nothing. Will someone's face abruptly leap into view from the other side? Other times genuine fear is substituted by musical crescendos that clearly signpost that a ""frightening"" bit is about to happen. That's not making people jump - it's deafening them.The end is where it all comes really unstuck, as Robert Zemeckis decides he wants to homage other horror movies. Fine if you haven't seen 'em. But when you've watched Carrie its blatantly obvious Harrison's hand will spring to life or the irksome shower/rocking chair love letters to Psycho, which merely annoy. The unrelenting predictability of its climax, trailer or no, really drags the film down, and it's underdeveloped coda bores. That said, the people I went with did receive their quota of shocks, so maybe I've watched too many movies.Unlikely to become anything other than average then, but What Lies Beneath will hopefully presage a new, maturer, relationship between character and sfx in the cinema. 5/10.",What Lies Beneath

Well, by the very end of the movie, we find out. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* Michelle Pfeifer and Harrison Ford play a happily married couple, until ghostly images begin to plague Claire (Pfeifer) in her home. Looking for help from her husband, Dr. Norman Spencer (Ford) every moment in this movie turns out to be involved with the climax somehow. Which I thought was good, because there were some slow moving parts of the movie that I thought ""Oh god, I'm going to die!"" and ""what does this have to do with anything?"". Everything. As I said, everything that happens turns out to be involved with the climax somehow. This is the only movie that I can honestly remember screaming out so very loud. When I did, I dropped by Lemonheads. When previews for this movie came out, me and my friends all thought that this movie would just be another one of THE SIXTH SENSE rip-offs like STIR OF ECHOES (which was a good one also). But, no--in my opinion, WHAT LIES BENEATH is better than THE SIXTH SENSE. Everything about this movie is better. The story. The acting (although Bruce Willis is very good also). *SPOILER* By the end of the film, we discover that Harrison Ford's character is the 'bad guy'. When he tries to kill his wife, this leads to a chase scene (traditionally there is one of these in every suspense thriller movie that I see), where after a long hard brawl, the 'bad guy' finally gets it. Only, for a slight twist, it isn't Michelle Pfeifer's character that kills him. If you want to know who kills him, you have to watch for yourself. Besides, I can't tell you even if I wanted to.

The movie is made by director Robert Zemeckis and has got a really creepy mood laying over itself. The movie is about Claire and Spencer that's married and are living in Spencer's dad house, who's father is actually dead. Living there Spencer is a doctor and has a lot of work to do and therefore doesn't spend much of his time with his wife at daytime, so Claire is chilling around alone in the neighbourhood. The new neighbours seem mysterious and she suddenly hears someone crying on the other side of the grind, she sees a woman and she seems scared to death. Now things starts happening and Claire is convinced that the place is haunted by a young girl... The movie starts off very good and is very exciting and interesting, but as the movie rolls on in over 90 minutes it all gets slowly boring and uninteresting pity enough. Although it does keep up the excitement through the movie, we're a bit tired of the whole thing at the end and just wants it all to quit. There are of course scenes in it that scare you, especially some considering a bathtub and stuff like that. Robert Zemeckis has done a pretty good job behind the cam and the mood, acting, music, a lots of it works pretty well but the big problem is simply that the script doesn't work, and so with the editing. The movie jumps back and forth (although it doesn't do that!) but you get the feeling that you don't understand what's going on and that is a bit irritating. Early on in the movie we get to like taste some of the scares in this movie (although it isn't scary) where Claire is looking through a small hole in the grind to see if she can get a look of the crying lady, and suddenly she jumps and a whole eye fills the hole on the other side, well, it's that kind of scare yeah. Although the scariest scene in the movie flashes upon very late, and so does the most thrilling. The movie tries making a new Hitchcock mood and it does it pretty well but as said before; the script ruins a lot of this movie, and another thing; the movie never reaches a point where you just want to leave the room, it keeps a pretty exciting mood and scenes through all, but never really scares the s**t out of you, although it seems like it wants too, with exception of the last scene with Pfeiffer suddenly changing her beautiful face into something not that beautiful, that scared me really good.

Michelle is much better then Harrison but still not great though every time ford was on screen I wanted to shoot myself. Even though there was a big twist you could see it coming a mile away.

Re-visiting it, I am surprised by how effective it is in the supernatural thriller genre. Like The Others, the film unnerves you by hinting at malevolent forces off-screen, rather than through sudden screams and bumps. The Hitchcockian influence shines through, most obviously when Pfeiffer is spying on her neighbour through binoculars, only to lose sight of him, and find him again - staring straight at her. Spine-tingling stuff.Ford gets to show his range in the third act. His staring and fidgeting at the side of the bathtub as he tries to drown his wife is both pathetic and disturbing, just what you would expect from a sociopath. Haunting, possession, resurrection - all the elements of horror are judiciously sprinkled through the film as rising dread gives way to horror.In short, an underrated piece that stands up to repeat viewing.",What Lies Beneath

She embarks on her own private investigation raking up some pretty nasty events from the past.Harrison Ford is always Harrison Ford.  I thought the ""Please forgive me scene"" on bended knee was most embarrassing to watch and ruined this little scene. The director should have modified the script at this point.  Also in the ""Drown her in the bath scene"" the close-ups indicated the bath water was constantly at different levels and not rising as it should have been. Little errors like this were made up for by the close up of bloodied hands reaching so slowly over the edge of the bath.  Quite terrifying.On the whole nothing very new or original.  I felt I had seen most of the action in previous films.  But I still admire the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer...even when paralysed by dangerous muscle-relaxing drugs...dragging herself along the floor. And didn't she recover quickly from her state of paralysis?  What a woman!",What Lies Beneath
93,PersianPlaya408,"average thriller, not so great",7,5 January 2006,"What Lies Beneath directed by Robert Zemeckis, starring Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, Diana Scarwid, Joe Morton, James RemarZemeckis' thriller about a wife of a professor who gets terrifying visions while living in her huge suburban home is neither as thought provoking or thrilling as it could have been. The performances are pretty good as both leads are memorable however it lacks a strong supporting cast and is a bit slow in its early stages. The film however does pick up and has some intense moments. Its not written very well though as some of the dialogues lack the intensity needed for the genre. THis is an average thriller and nothing more. Its a bit predictable and the characters are a bit static. 7/10",What Lies Beneath
94,Movie-12,"Has elements of a good horror thriller, but lacks crafty structure. **1/2 (out of four)",6,20 September 2000,"WHAT LIES BENEATH / (2000) **1/2 (out of four)""What Lies Beneath"" has all the elements of a good horror thriller: the moody atmosphere, proper character and setting introduction, and a mysterious premise that keeps the audience on edge. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are perfectly cast as a couple who experience surreal psychological terror that is both involving and suspenseful. Both leading performers deliver superb performances; Ford is flawless in another calm, cold, collected character, and Pfeiffer is astonishing with a vivid, taut performance. With all these positive variables going for the film, it should have been something very specialbut it isn't. 	""What Lies Beneath"" stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as Norman and Claire Spencer, happy couple who just sent their only daughter, Caitlin (Katharine Towne), to college. The two live on a beautiful New England lake inherited by Norman's late father, in which gardening and making love are regular occurrences. Norman in a busy person as a scientist conducting research on an antidote that makes a living specimen paralyzed for a short period of time. Claire's homemaker lifestyle is pretty relaxed, although the past leaves her deeply emotional.	The Spencer's new neighbors, Warren (James Remar) and Mary Feur (Miranda Otto), are seemingly having marital problems. Although Claire and Norman haven't properly introduced themselves to the Feurs, they witness several events that disturb the harmony in their neighborhood. After several incidences that give Claire the impression that Warren may have murdered his spouse, she digs deeper into the situation and uncovers what may include a closet full of skeletons that induce supernatural occurrences within her home. 	The script, by Sarah Kernochan and Clack Gregg, varies a great deal in quality. On one account the film's story is revealing and tension-filled because we bond with the Claire character as she unravels the circumstances and learns information as we do. We are involved and intrigued because neither the audience nor Claire knows what will transpire. There are a few elements left unexamined, but the production has an engrossing atmosphere to keep us on the edge of our seats. 	On another note, structurally the film fails. We receive an opening detailing Claire's investigation of her neighbor's murder mystery. The movie spends a minimum of forty-five minutes dealing with this issue, but half-way in, the movie completely drops the subject and reveals (spoiler) the subplot had no significant purpose whatsoever in the overall story. Instead of going somewhere with the earlier plot (which is capable of carrying the movie on its own), the plot opens a brand new series of events almost entirely unconnected to the previous. This structure is a false first act (always a pleasure to analyze). Although well styled, the structure clearly exemplifies the sloppiness of the script, as does the conclusion, which is lunacy in itself even if you willingly suspend your disbelief.
	Director Robert Zemickis has made some very good movies, several that have earned slots on my top ten lists. I am, of course, speaking of such superior pictures like ""Contact,"" and best picture winner of 1994, ""Forrest Gump."" In addition to those films, he has also lent his expertise to unworthy productions like ""The Frighteners,"" starring Michael J. Fox, several of the ""Tales from the Crypt"" installments, and now ""What Lies Beneath."" Here, what really could have been a successful thriller turns from precarious to pathetic simply because it tries to cover way too much material for a single movie.",What Lies Beneath
95,the red duchess,a post-'Scream' 'straight' chiller (possible spoiler in last paragraph),6,25 October 2000,"**SPOILERS**   **SPOILERS** Is it possible, in the wake of 'Scream' and its inertia-veering ilk, to offer today's audience a 'straight'  horror movie, especially if that horror movie is a ghost story, that most vulnerable of its sub-genres to falling on its face.  You're inclined to think Robert Zemeckis believes so, because, despite a few humorous moments firmly rooted in character, he offers an admirably solemn chiller aimed at tensing you to maddening point, preying on those fears you'd rather repress, those things that lie beneath.For about 100 minutes.  The first thing to be wary about in this movie - and this is the sort of movie where you need to be manically vigilant or you needn't bother - is the title.  It's too easy, almost mocking.  After all, the whole point of a horror movie is to reveal what lies beneath.  You may as well call a crime film 'Cops and Robbers' or a period effort 'Frills and Flounces'.By a canny Zemickian paradox, however, the opposite may be actually true. For this is a movie that wears its Hitchcockian subtext defiantly on its surface.  It plays with at least three different 'classic' horror-thriller staples.  At first you might think you're watching 'Rear Window', as Claire believes the mysteriously uncivil man next door has done away with his wife. As in Hitchcock's film, there is the ambiguous night scene, where the husband appears to be bundling off a corpse.  There is the voyeurism, culminating in a brilliant, hilarious, shocking shot, where Claire's prying eye is met by the eye she was spying on through the fence.  You figure Hitchcock would approve.  She spies on the husband with binoculars and he catches her doing it.  Her lover, in this case her husband, doesn't believe her.  L.B. Jeffries was a cameraman, photographs play a big part in this movie.  While her husband is out making all the money, she is alone and vulnerable.  Like the two couples in 'Rear Window', Claire finds uncomfortable affinities with the victim.But just when you're patting yourself on the back and asking how gender transforms the classic Hitchcockian set-up, the whole thing is revealed as a damp squib, and you have to begin again (although you do get an excellent joke when she meets the suspect and his victim at a party).
The other two options are similarly 'traditional'.  There is the psychological deterioration model.  Zemeckis pushes this for all it is worth, making Claire a mother who has just lost her only child to college, who's recovering from an horrific car crash only a year ago, whose husband neglects her for his work, and most importanly, who has given up her music career to raise her daughter and support a family.  There's enough in there to frazzle the hardiest kook.  Add an isolated house with a dodgy front door, and is it any wonder she's having visions?This model brings horror close to its roots in melodrama, where the horrors become a displacement of the frustration and repressions of a woman limited in her life choices - the home serves as a metaphor for both her entrapment and her deteriorating mind.  The first image, over the credits, is seen as an hallucination of Claire's, and we are properly on our guard throughout. This breakdown is catered for by the whole gamut of classic Freudian paraphernalia - repeated scenes (the bath), submergence in water, keys, rings, bracelets, hair, doors, glass, mirrors, Oedipal problems etc, all leading us to suspect a sexually based trauma.  This is linked to the third model, the family secret, where a past horror is locked away, and is slowly eating away at the family and its individuals.  Relief will not come until it is expelled.As I say, for about 100 minutes Zemickis plays on all three models with surface seriousness and covert playfulness (which is what really lies beneath).  This is fine by me, the repertoire of haunted house cliches is generally amusing, especially when done with such intelligence, visual (all that white with its sparse splashes of red; the ghostly message on the mirror, 'You Know', cracking over Claire's fogged reflecton), formal (loved those scenes with the psychiatrist) beauty, and rich characterisation of the female lead.  This method achieves some excellent jerks, and an atmosphere almost as chilling in its potential as 'Final Destination'.But a state of tense suspension cannot be held indefinitely (in Hollywood anyway), and plot must out.  This shift can be accurately traced at the moment when Claire's point of view, which has, without interruption, dominated and filtered the film for 100 minutes.  For the film to achieve resoluton, it has to move from female time, which is repetitive, fluid, elliptical, enigmatic, open into male time, which is straight-ahead, no-nonsense, progresive, explanatory, closed.  This is a gross stereotype, but it's true here, and as Norman takes over, the film collapses into daft 'Fatal Attraction' territory.  Or it appears to, until you wonder whether Zemeckis's joke is finally paying off, as he asks how we could possibly have taken this seriously, with the 'Psycho' quotes in the film and on the soundtrack virtually giving it away.  The way Claire gets out of the death-bath and her final supernatural rescue are so ridiculous they have to be a joke.  And so a subtle portrait of marriage and female loneliness becomes another post-modern joke.  Oh well.",What Lies Beneath
96,FlickJunkie-2,An excellent supernatural suspense thriller,8,21 February 2001,"Robert Zemeckis has made a career out of melding excellent stories with great visual effects (`Who Framed Roger Rabbit', `Back to the Future', `Forrest Gump').  He is a very versatile director who can adeptly shift from genre to genre.  In this film, he again demonstrates his talent, creating a spooky supernatural thriller delivering some of the best suspense I've seen in years.The story by Sarah Kernochan (`9 ½ Weeks', `Sommersby') where the dead victim communicates with someone living to finger the killer is not innovative and has been done numerous times in various forms.  What makes this film good is Zemeckis' presentation.  It has elements of Hitchcock suspense with the benefit of modern technology and visual effects. Zemeckis' use of camera and sound produces extraordinary suspense and startling surprises that make viewers jump out of their seats.  There is a lot of silence in this film with no background music which makes the surprises that much more dramatic.  He peppers the film with false alarms so you never know if the buildup is for something genuinely scary or just the dog.  Though none of the techniques is new, they are all used extremely effectively.  The film creates terror with very little gore and violence, proving that the use of these techniques in horror films is overdone and unnecessary.  Often what we don't see is far more frightening than what we do.The acting in this film is outstanding.  Michelle Pfeiffer gives a brilliant performance as Claire; the overwrought wife who everyone thinks is losing her mind when she starts talking about communing with the dead.  Pfeiffer takes her character right to the edge and her hysterical fear at the events that transpire is awesome.  Harrison Ford plays an unaccustomed role, departing from his normal white hat hero.  He shows great range by handling the sinister aspects of his character nefariously.  Diana Scarwid also gives an enjoyable performance as Claire's best friend.Though this film doesn't redefine the genre, it is a fine example of frightening suspense under the guidance of a talented director.  I rated it an 8/10.  Be prepared for a heart pounding experience.",What Lies Beneath

98,khatcher-2,Homage to Hitchcock: and remarkably successful,7,27 October 2002,"One gets a little tired of Harrison Ford: he is a somewhat one-faced actor, with that same quirkish smile on one side of his face, and not much else. However, Michelle Pfeiffer is always good to watch  whether she takes her clothes off or not  and in this case she is as good as in any film I have seen her. Indeed, I must add, so is Ford, despite himself playing himself and not much else, but which happily slides into place here reasonably well.Zemeckis must have wanted to emulate Alfred Hitchcock: Dr. Spencer is Norman, some nicely suspenseful scenes take place in the bathroom, she spies on her neighbours through her indiscreet windows with binoculars, and one half expects Rebecca to appear on the screen at any moment. She doesn't, but some rather good hallucination effects, especially with reflections in mirrors, bath-water and lake-water, and rain-soaked darkened windows, keeps one's apprehension alive to the end. Some clever camera-work completes the Hitchcockian tradition.Zemeckis' taught and concentrated directing, together with a performance at times inspired by Michelle Pfeiffer, has managed to pull of quite a feat: an updated version of what might well have been from the old maestro himself, without any sense of `remake' and far from any plagiarising. That in itself is enough to be a worthy and respectful homage from a present-day director for the erstwhile master of suspense. A generous salute to the venerable author of several little masterpieces.The film is well-paced throughout, gathering momentum as it progresses; it is as if the building tenseness is itself the cause of quickening pace, which Zemeckis keeps well under control. I am not particularly a fan of horror or terror films, but `What Lies Beneath' has quite a lot going for it. My vote is slightly above the IMDb average.",What Lies Beneath
99,OriginalMovieBuff21,A decent thriller,7,29 October 2004,"It has been a long time since I have seen this movie but I still have a good memory of what this film was like. Okay, first things first. I thought the movie was decent with some freaky moments but none the less ridiculous on most part of the movie. It's just like any other horror film. The acting was also decent but Harrison Ford, like most of his his movies, was great. What this movie has a good thing upon it, is that there are many jumping parts. I mean on every scene you usually see Michelle Pheiffer walk slowly up the stairs when the scary music is playing and you see a steamy bathroom. Those parts are kind of freaky. I recommend this movie if your a couple looking for a scare, but I would rather rent The Shining insteadHedeen's outlook: 6.5/10 **+ C",What Lies Beneath
100,Antagonisten,A decent thriller,6,17 March 2005,"Classic thrillers are not one of the most popular genres these days. Especially not ones like this one where the element of the thrill is quite pronounced. It's a genre that i appreciate though, even though i wasn't expecting very much from director Robert Zemeckis. A man i feel is more skilled at wasting high budgets on sappy over-emotional movies than actually directing something enjoyable.This is a nice-looking movie. Still it's hard to see where the whopping 100 million dollar budget went. Because this is not a spectacular effect filled thriller, rather it's quite sublime, which i very much enjoyed. The story of the couple living their quiet life until a mistake from the past comes to haunt them is maybe nothing unique, but it's well executed. Michelle Pfeiffer was decent enough in the female lead, while Harrison Ford seemed to be on Valium. Most of the time his lines come out garbled and he looks distant, how he is supposed to play Indiana Jones once again is beyond me.I found this to be an enjoyable movie. With suspense building effectively early on, and with a nice twist toward the end. The stylish look is somewhat overdone in some scenes, but mostly it works fine. Zemeckis has created an entertaining classic thriller. I rate it 6/10.",What Lies Beneath

""What Lies Beneath"" does for bathtubs what ""Psycho"" did for showers. One of the most memorable scenes and movies in recent memory.When the Spencer's daughter leaves for college, Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Norman (Harrison Ford) are on their own again. Besides the suspicious activities of their new neighbors right across the fence from them, unexplained phenomena begins to happen inside their home as well. Over time, Claire becomes convinced that someone is trying to reach her from the realm of the dead, so she and her best friend, Jody, hold a seance to try and communicate with and ascertain the identity of her house's haunter. As she continues to investigate, she finds out a truth so harsh and cold that she could never have imagined it in a million years.I really liked this film. It wasn't a B-movie where there are a lot of teenagers running around trying to piece together a supernatural mystery as they are being picked off one-by-one. This is a very smart and well developed story with great actors who are up to the task. You don't know what is happening ... you are clued in along with Claire as she digs deeper to find out the secret behind the initials of MEF. And the bathtub scene ... wow! Fantastic. That's all I am going to say about that since to say more would be to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it yet.This is a high recommend. It is on my ""favorites"" list - one I've seen many times and have never gotten tired of.

It's story is an unpredictable tale that evokes lots of tension and suspense, ultimately building to a nail-biting finale. The climax of this film is one of the intense in recent cinematic memory. The direction of Zemeckis also shines in true Hitchcock style. We are given lots of stylishly shot sequences and fine touches of detail that add all the more to the realism of this film.The cast is quite good. Michelle Pfeiffer is genuine in her portrayal of the spooked housewife, as is Harrison Ford who does a terrific turn as her husband.Whether seen for its artistic direction or just for an evening of good spooky entertainment, What Lies Beneath is a great watch.*** 1/2 out of ****",What Lies Beneath
104,jhaggardjr,Spooky horror film with a weak ending,7,8 August 2000,"""What Lies Beneath"" is for the most part a spooky horror film that entertained me. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer star as a couple who live in a house that's inhabited by a ghost. Pfeiffer begins to realize that strange things are happening and they're usually happening when she's alone. Doors open by themselves, the bathtub fills up with water all by itself, pictures fall on the floor, weird noises, etc. The ghost is someone Ford knew in the past, and it's because of a fatal mistake Ford made. ""What Lies Beneath"", directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a pretty entertaining film for most of its running time. But the same can't be said of the final 20 minutes. The last 20 minutes of this film is a big letdown. It's stupid, ridiculous, laughable, silly, and unbelievable. That's a real shame because ""What Lies Beneath"" builds up an effective ghost story until it spins out of control at the end. It's not as good as most of Zemeckis' earlier films but I'm barely giving ""What Lies Beneath"" thumbs up because it's intriguing and suspenseful up until the climax. *** (out of four)",What Lies Beneath

The audience seemed to agree since I'm almost deaf from all the girls screaming at the top of their lungs. Of course, the director/scriptwriter doesn't realise when enough is enough and takes the story one step to far and it was quite embarrassing that no one just paused to think about the fact that the movie audience has seen this millions of times and knows _exactly_ what buttons the makers of films push.

Robert Zemeckis takes the multi layered story and slowly peels it back for us to see.  The film is a throwback to the style of Alfred Hitchcock.  There are subtle hints here and there for the observant viewer to pick up on, and it makes for an entertaining package.  Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are very good in their roles. Zemeckis restrains from using any flashy camera tricks and lets the scenes unfold in a natural way.  He also doesn't let the visual effects call attention to themselves. Here the visual effects are a supplement to the story.  The effects are subtle, and blend into the scenes quite effectively.  Like a good showman, Zemeckis will give us a glimpse of things that whet our appetite for more.  I won't say anymore, other than it's a good way to spend an afternoon or evening.",What Lies Beneath

Now I finally saw it.I must say that this is not a bad movie but it also isn't my personal favorite kind of movie. It is clever in a way that it blends together different styles like muder mystery, supernatural ghost story, and psychological thriller. When watching you can't be exactly sure what's it really about, until in the end. If you like that kind of paranoid feeling, then this might be up your alley. For me it was a little bit of everything but not enough of anything.Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer surely can act but for some reason I wasn't very interested in their characters, and there are very few other characters in the story. It works almost like a stage play where these two people are in the house most of the time.

""What Lies beneath"" is much too simple and overlong to be in the spirit of Hitchcock. Yes, the woman spies on her neighbors, which is a very clear reference to Hitchcock - but that is not anywhere near enough. Towards the end, the plot works its way through elements that any low-budget horror flick would contain, that we have seen hundreds of times before. This film is simply not original enough to stand out, despite its promising start and clever touches.There were, however, things that were very novel and innovative: the extensive use of mirrors, particularly near the end, is very clever. It increases the sense of entrapment and fear and it is almost unbearable by the time Claire reaches the cars (one of which is of course a Volvo, since Volvo seems very intent on making their cars appear in every single American film).Another thing that raises the grade is simply this: this film is EXTREMELY scary. I can't remember when I was spooked so thoroughly and so many times by a movie - but it does get tedious near the end.

It's a great one to watch with a date, in the dark, but I don't think it's worth watching more than once-- a screenplay from a first-timer, plus a director with nothing to do while ""Cast Away"" was on filming hiatus, equals nothing more than a vanity project, an experiment in style.  Like his mentor Spielberg before him, Zemeckis has gotten old and apparently has nothing new to show us.",What Lies Beneath
119,Brian-272,Just Goes To Show Your Past Really Can Comeback To Haunt You.,6,23 July 2000,"This poltergeist suspense filled thriller does a great job of keeping a viewer on the edge of his or her seat. While watching What Lies Beneath in the theater I had myself guessing was that neighbor in the house across from Harrison and Michelle really a manic killer who killed his wife? As the film reaches midway point we learn the hauntings are related to a past affair that Mr. professor (Harrison Ford's) character had with a college student of his, though we don't learn of her death to the end her spirit is clearly alive at any moment. I must once again give praise to Michelle Pfeiffer's performance she plays complex characters so well especially this one. Michelle's beauty is always aggressively stunning. Michelle's pairing as Harrison's wife gave this film such great on screen chemistry. The camera work in this film is done in such a spectacular and spooky way that you feel Alfred Hitchcock is dead right at work. The overhead shots of Michelle in the bathtub bring back memories of Psycho. Though this film happens to be a little to long and drawn out plus it has a complex plot, it teaches us a lesson that our past secrets especially bad ones will come back to haunt us even destroying or taking our life for good. This film showed once again that Michelle and Harrison both still have big time box office appeal and great drawing power.

Michelle Pfeiffer's wife to scientist Harrison Ford believes their house is haunted by a single ghost. For the majority of this film we're led down a path of tense scares and frights, which are conjured from thin air. Robert Zemeckis knows how to add these unbearable moments without us really knowing what they're about. Pfeiffer puts in a stellar performance as the jittery, mentally unbalanced wife, whereas Ford's as wooden as a tree trunk, not giving a hoot about his wife's slowly deteriorating health. What Lies Beneath is a very thrilling thriller, with the bathtub scene (no, not sexual in any way) likely to stick to the mind for a long, long time.",What Lies Beneath

I won't bother to describe the story, but you may want to see it for reasons other than suspense or interesting story (actors involved, etc). If not, I would recommend staying away. There's just no suspense here at all, and it has nothing to do with anything but the fact that this film has been endlessly rehashed, rehashed and rehashed yet again.

The college-bound daughter like the friends Claire and Norman meet for dinner serve no purpose; the scenes with the psychiatrist and the endless references to ""the"" car accident seem obligatory rather than necessary and a number of scenes centering around the new neighbors turn out to be red herrings. Too many scenes feel perfunctory with characters introduced to make expository points only to drop out of sight. The convoluted screenplay is talky and unoriginal with a finale out of Clouzet's Diabolique. Still, WLB is grounded by Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as well as good work from Harrison Ford and Diana Scarwid and for what it is, it works, and it'ultimately it works better than Zemeckis' Flight (2012) which also suffers from excess baggage and unnecessary characters.",What Lies Beneath

He was certainly playing the role very ""low key"". 
Clearly, this is a competent and expenisive (at US$20 million) Hollywood pic. 
The scenery is superb, sets wonderful, fine cinematography with remarkable attention to detail. Maybe too much screming !
This film should be at least 20 minutes shorter, imho. Many segments seemed to be purposely drawn-out, to the point pf irritation. 
""What Lies Beneath"" qualifies easily as a good horror flick, with two top movie stars and an excellent supporting cast. 
The problem/s? The reason/s I couldn't give more than 6 stars? Primarily, the picture is too damn long, but also I felt there was a real lost opportunity to add more ingredients, a special ""spark"", in order to distinguish this effort from so many similar movies ~ to make it rise well above Exactly what these improvements might be, I cannot say, and obviously the producers, writers and director were unable to come up with ideas.

It is one of those stories that produce mystery and surprise by going out of its way to withhold essential information which the characters would normally have and one of those stories whose chief surprise, when sprung, makes nonsense of the whole. Like most ghost stories it happens in an almost unpopulated world so that the visitee can be alone and scared and be assured it's all in her imagination, and such characters as appear are there mainly so that she can learn things in the sequence and on the schedule the writers learned in Suspense Movie Writing 101.

I'm not going to spoil it for you because this movie is definitely worth a viewing. It was spooky, but not gruesome or horrific as a horror would normally be. It was pretty low key and untypical for a horror movie. I would have classified this more like a thriller though instead of a horror. However, it does have lots of suspenseful moments, which could be their reason for classifying this in the horror genre. It's still very good, believable for sure and it has unexpected twists and turns, which caused this movie to stand out as unique. Who doesn't like something different and non-cliché' or typical? I only wish the daughter that went off to college at the beginning had come back into the picture as a means of support and some family closure. But well worth my viewing time.

The acting is good, Michelle Pfeiffer conveying genuine fear and rising panic and even Mr Wooden, Harrison Ford, relishes his role, one of his few as a villain.

138,danielll_rs,What lies beneath an unjustly criticized horror film,6,26 September 2000,"WHAT LIES BENEATH (2000)-- Grade: B+WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADHorror is for sure a very controversial genre: or you love it or you hate it. I love it for many reasons. The main one is, I think, the most common: I like to feel scared. It's a strange feeling, delightful, almost sadomasochist. But it is great! Of course there is a huge number of contrivances that makes the audience feel scared (chilling score, dark rooms, people coming from behind), but it's worth of it. Films like THE SHINING, THE EXORCIST, SCREAM, HALLOWEEN make me feel proud of watching them. So I was anxiously expecting the new horror movie to come: WHAT LIES BENEATH. After two box-office hits last year (a great one that is THE SIXTH SENSE and an awful one: THE BLAIR WITH PROJECT) and the end of SCREAM trilogy, there had to be something good on the genre. And WHAT LIES BENEATH covered all my expectations.The reaction of the critics was not very good, so I was a little worried about it, but I didn't care much about that and wanted to see the movie with my own eyes. What I saw was a film which only ""big"" flaw was the lack of originality. The story and some scenes use stale elements from THE SIXTH SENSE, REAR WINDOW, FATAL ATTRACTION and STIR OF ECHOES. It's difficult to make a totally original film in Hollywood nowadays, but Zemeckis should have been more audacious. Taking that, WHAT LIES BENEATH is a joy to watch. Some of the elements it borrows from other films are like homages, especially to the master Alfred Hitchcock. And when it wants to be scary, it is. There are a lot of jumpy scenes, a thing I love, even if they are kind of predictable. There is a chilling atmosphere and a very well crafted story. Some people complain about the screenplay, but I think it's one of the best things. It's well written and at the end you will see that the things fit each other.
The first half is terrific, similar to Hitchcock films: driving you slowly into the characters and the situations. The second half is more like a modern horror: scary, twisted, more violent and fast-paced. The last 20 minutes, which have been very criticized, are sometimes unbelievable, but it's edge-of-your-seat suspense, like a roller coast, especially the bathtub scene, with delightful references to PSYCHO and the French classic LES DIABOLIQUES. Behind all that there is the hand of Robert Zemeckis, who won an Oscar and knows what he is doing. If he doesn't have a very original story in hands, he makes that into a film that is scarier and more intriguing than others. What also helps is the acting. I don't even need to talk about the central couple. Harrison Ford redeemed himself of RANDOM HEARTS and Michelle Pfeiffer... She is terrific! Her expressions of horror are amazing (inspired by Drew Barrymore in SCREAM!), and her performance is worth of recognition. Not to say that she is totally gorgeous at 43 and... Well, she is a joy to watch!One of the biggest complaints of the critics was about the trailer. They said it trashed all the twists and surprises of the film, so I decided to shut my eyes and my ears when they showed the trailer before other film I saw. I think the trailer shows scenes of the second half, when Claire already knows about the affair between Norman and the girl. If they really show this, it's shameful.Despite its minor flaws, WHAT LIES BENEATH didn't deserve to be so criticized. It's a well crafted, well acted, well directed, spooky, suspenseful and scary piece of modern horror. It's a delight for horror/suspense fans.",What Lies Beneath

Well, Pfefier does an even better performance, she sees a ghost & searches for the truth.

She goes for the phone, presses Redial and..... ""Dammit, dammit, dammit! These modern day phones again! If this movie would've been made in the 60s this scene would've been useless"", Norman thinks...  ehhh well let's start all over again.What Lies Beneath is a very well done tensed thriller. And if you watch it at night, in complete darkness and very attentively, getting involved in the action, it's impossible not to become really scared at some points. I certainly did.Claire and Norman form a happily married couple. Their daughter just left to college and now it's just them in a huge modern house. Well almost just them... The problems start when Claire starts hearing and seing things, and gets convinced that the house is haunted.Robert Zemeckis does a very good job creating a well balanced tensed thriller. The plot is well contured and grows logically, the characters are powerful, the scenes are very tensed and sometimes spooky, the actors play great. Especially Michelle Pfeiffer - am i out of line if i think that after this performance Michelle would definetely deserve an Oscar? Well she does.Well with so many good points, what's wrong with the movie? Why does it have an average of only 6,9? Why did i give it only a 7? Because of its lack of originality. During the whole film you have the feeling of seing a new Hitchcock movie. Well it's not Alfred Hitchcock, it's Robert Zemeckis, or more like... Al-bert Zemetchcock. The same tensed situations, of a rich guy living in a huge house, the same scenes with creaking doors and reflections in the mirror, the same many bathroom scenes, but this time the accent is not on the shower, but on the bath tub. This is related to Psycho. But it's not only this. The same haunted house story that we've seen many times. The same ""revenging ghost"", the same situations with woman seing things and his husband doesn't believe her, the same (many) situations in which you are extremely scared and it turns out to be the dog, the same ""resurrection"" of the bad guy, who wakes up a few times before totally dying.In conclusion, a movie that's worth to be watched. Alone, in the dark. Just like Psycho. Otherwise you won't get scared. And without getting scared, it's no point in watching it.ORIGINALITY: 4, PLOT: 6, CHARACTERS: 8, ACTORS: 10 (Michelle is fabulous), DIRECTOR: 8, OVERALL: 8. TOTAL: 7 out of 10.",What Lies Beneath

If done right, this genre really knows how to pump up your adrenaline and keep you coming back for more each time around. In this specific case, what's so good about the film (What Lies Beneath) starts out with the mere cast & crew list. When you have Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer as your lead stars on the one hand, and the extremely talented Robert Zemeckis on the other  there are only limited ways in which you can go wrong. Luckily for us viewers, What Lies Beneath manages to escape these clichés and come out victorious as an original and engaging supernatural thriller all the way.The plot revolves around Norman and Claire Spenser (Ford/Pfieffer), a middle aged couple who's seemingly going through a mid-life crisis when Claire's daughter (from her first marriage) leaves home. However, we find out soon enough that things that may seem idyllic on the surface are far from it when viewed upon closely. When Claire begins to have visions of a missing young college student and goes through supernatural experiences, her ""picture perfect"" life turns out to be a far cry from what she thought.Most Important thing about this film, though, is its re-watchable value.

144,cofemug,The movie that would put the world off Hollywood,1,4 August 2000,"This movie was actually painful to watch.  I am serious.  I had stomach pains because of how bad the movie was.  The plot was awful, the acting was horrid, the scripting was worse, the rip-offs were obvious, and the scares predictable.  The whole movie should have been banned in the United States because of how bad it is.  And what is movie-making coming to when people think that mediocre movie-making is excellent?  That is if the movie even qualifies as mediocre.First, the acting was just the worst acting I have seen in a while from a Hollywood movie.  Worse than Mission To Mars because the acting wasn't campy, and wasn't good either.  Harrison Ford sleeps his way through this picture, and barely shows any emotions throughout the movie, even when he is mad.  It's like watching somebody say ""Darn"" as they pound their fist on a table.  And Michelle Pfeiffer is the latest scream queen.  Her acting abilities are lower than Linnea Quigley's.  At least Linnea Quigley does nudity.  (Check ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"" for her acting abilities.) Pfeiffer is the most over-the-top, and over-paid, actress out there.  At least she matched the movie ""Scarface"" for excessiveness.Second, the plot.  **Spoilers****spoilers**The first act of the plot is one major red herring that takes way too much time.  It is a condensed version of ""Rear Window"" minus the broken leg.  And, if nobody saw the changed ending, then my screen name isn't ""Cofemug.""  However, one can hope, and I hoped because that would mean that the movie would have been blessedly short.  The rest of the movie has been given away by previews, with the revelation of the affair and the article behind the picture.  The best part is the computer.  The ghost is a techno geek.  And it knows cards so well. The initials should have been m.i.l.f.  (Apologies to ""American Pie"") 
Third, the scripting.  With awful dialogue, scenes out of nowhere that do not enhance the plot or the characters, and a pacing that is even slower than that of ""Eyes Wide Shut,"" ""Spartucus,"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" this movie's writer should be fired and banned from ever scripting again.  9 1/2 weeks at least had nothing much to do, and had decent sex scenes.  This movie needed a cattle prod to get moving.  And the line, ""I think she suspects something.""  Come on.Last, the direction.  With framing that is awful, and that does not make me feel uncomfortable, and shots ripped off from other movies, Zemeckis has reached a new low.  **Spoilers**  He steals looks from his own movie, ""Death Becomes Her,""  steals the first act's look from ""Rear Window,""  steals two shots from the shower scene of ""Psycho,""  stelas the end shot from ""Vertigo,""  steals the drug idea from ""Notorious,""  the list goes on and on. I have seen this movie before, done so much better.  Luckily my money was not wasted on this drivel.In the end, skip this movie, and burn all of the prints of it.  It is more boring than ""Titanic,"" more irritating than ""The Blair Witch Project"" (and less scary), less scary than ""Rosemary's Baby,"" and less funny than ""Mission to Mars.""  Run away from this movie as fast as you can.  Go find ""Cecil B. Demented"" which is anti-Hollywood.  Go see ""Scary Movie"" or something else.

This is the beginning point of which resulted on of the best, if not THE best Horror/Thriller movie ever done, even better than Sleepy Hollow and Psycho. Long time applauded director Robert Zemeckis, filmed this while he was filming Cast Away, with What Lies Beneath clearly leaping a step in ahead. Based on an idea of Steven Spielberg, the movie starts going slow, building up the tension, thrilling here and there, until the end where it bombs us with thousands of revelations, horror, action, jumps and screams. As the movie starts' going to the end Zemeckis presents us with incredible camera movements (see the scene where Claire runs away from home in her truck amazing-).

Anyway, we went on a double date and saw this film. It was great then as is was 20 years ago when it came out on 2000. I saw this last night and I couldn't finish it, so I bought it on Play station network. This is how a movie is to be made. Suspenseful, well written and it doesn't hurt to have high caliber stars playing the main roles like Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Magnificent acting and a story that holds your interest with plenty of jump scares. Folks, they just don't make films like this anymore and that's just plain sad. A twenty year old movie that's better than anything out today and without a ton of special effects, sure there were some, but just enough to enhance the wonder of the movie. Really worth watching! Peace.",What Lies Beneath
148,Dar Star,What lies beneath? Not much.,5,9 February 2001,"An average movie in every sense of the word.  The acting and script are okay, despite the fact that Harrison Ford seemed to have his mind on his golf game or something.  The story cannot decide if it is going to be a supernatural thriller or a real suspense thriller.  It tries to be both and, as a result, leaves the audience with a very mediocre taste of what he/she has just seen.  Five out of ten stars *****",What Lies Beneath
149,thehumanduvet,Solidly creepy chiller,7,18 June 2001,"A good old-fashioned scary movie, avoiding irony and self-referentialism at every turn, this film relies on a nice premise and some well-executed creepy atmosphere for its impact. Pfeiffer and Ford work well together as a middle-aged couple, with Pfeiffer particularly effective as the homey (though obviously ridiculously beautiful) mother left alone when her daughter heads off to college, working herself up into a panic at various, vaguely spooky goings-on around the place. The film plays its cards close to its chest throughout, working the old game of keeping the audience guessing for a good while ? is there really something supernatural going on, is it some kind of creepy but human plot, or is it all in her head? Of course it's all revealed in the end, in a solidly scary, thrilling and well-executed finale. A classic it ain't, but it has a kind of workmanlike, reliable quality oozing out of every scene.",What Lies Beneath

The first hour or so is interesting, but everything takes SO long. And I would have liked it more, I think, if the supernatural stuff was more hinted at, leaving you to wonder if it was just all coincidence or a true haunting. James Remar does a nice but too-short turn as a menacing-looking professor to whom Michelle gives the REAR WINDOW treatment.",What Lies Beneath
151,brandon_lee420,Review: What Lies Beneath,6,9 April 2010,"I had a very vague memory of watching ""What Lies Beneath when I was nine years old, at the age where I loved even the crappiest films ever recorded in history. The only part of this film I could remember was mysteriously the end, where you find out that Harrison Ford's character is actually the culprit, and that lead me to believe, many years later, that this was my forgotten viewing masterpiece. I had a choice of watching it again or not but my choice was pretty obvious and considering my praise for this particular film, I went out and bought myself a brand new copy. The beginning scene where Claire's daughter is going away to college, I was already impressed. I hated those sex-crazed teens that always ruin the movie and have to pay for it at the end. The cut on her was very wise and it made the film that much better. Look at me ranting on about a b*tch I don't even know of. Harrison Ford plays a medical doctor who goes by the name of Norman Spencer and he actually knows more than he is hiding about the case his wife is investigating. The twist at the end was so unexpected and shocking and that twist made the film for what it is, and that is a decent thriller/drama. Harrison Ford plays his role convincingly and strongly which makes him the best out of the whole film. Michelle Pfeiffer on the other hand is quite hateable because her acting isn't even worth a dime. My reason for bulging her eyes out is not a good one but it is her fault not mine. James Remar, who plays Warren Feur, did a good job of being accused for killing his wife and it really added more mystery to the film as well. He is a light side to this thriller mystery by being funny. The director should have included him more. The scene at the party was laugh out loud funny as Warren teases Claire. The story is great but is painfully slow all at the same time. I was really disappointed at that and I was expecting something fast-paced. There were hardly any scares in this film and when a scary face popped up it did not make me scream even for a second. The seance scene was, to be honest, quite scary and funny at the same time all thanks to Diana Scarwid.Norman Spencer, a university research scientist, is growing more and more concerned about his wife, Claire, a retired concert cellist who a year ago was involved in a serious auto accident, and who has just sent off her daughter Caitlin (Norman's stepdaughter) to college. Now, Claire reports hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside Vermont home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. An increasingly frightened Claire thinks the phenomena have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without apparent explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist; she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice? Try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody, and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth of What Lies Beneath.The film definitely has to be something you have to watch out for but in some cases it didn't work for me. The slow story and the cheap scares really made me sick. The cons were: slow story, bad acting from Michelle Pfeiffer, cheap scares. Pros were: Harrison Ford's acting, James Remar, Diana Scarwid, and the priceless twist at the end. I recommend this over Hide and Seek at any time.",What Lies Beneath
152,fallyhag,Even my goosebumps had goosebumps!!!,7,13 October 2000,"Well I must confess to being a Han Solo and Cat woman fan anyway, so no matter what I would have found something good to say about this film. Luckily though, this film did achieve it's aim and entertained me fully.A lonely housewife is left at home each day by her career hungry husband. Whilst at home she observes the neighbours and their strange goings, which starts the goosebump ride from hell. The very basic plot is that she believes that her neighbours husband has murdered his wife, and starts to get more involved to find out the truth.There are no monsters or obvious scare moments but plenty of subtle shadows and well composed musical climaxes that constantly scare the pants off you. At one point in the film I was just hoping for a break in the story just to relax a bit.It has been a while since a good scare movie was released and this one is well worth the visit. So if you like eyeballs that stare back at you and doors that creek in the dark then this ghostly film is for you.",What Lies Beneath

Just about every line of dialogue was predictable and of course there was that almost inevitable ""just when you think the bad guy's dead, he isn't quite dead and will come back to fight one last time"". The oldest play in the desperates' play book.This movie also just couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to be, a murder mystery, or a ghost story. Clearly, the producers and the director couldn't make up their minds either so they decided to have an each way bet. What they finished up making is a mish-mash of confusion, cliche and just plain bad film making.Such a waste of time and talent; normally I rate Harrison Ford highly but in this his best efforts appear to have been thwarted.",What Lies Beneath

Not to give anything away but I kind of knew what was going to happen half-way into the movie.

The moody noir photography, and Alan Silvestri's appropriate musical score with those ethereal choral touches ... greatness. But there's really no room in quality film for that cheap, ages-old adolescent shock device of a disembodied hand emerging from offscreen onto the unsuspecting shoulder of our heroine who gasps and does a 180° whirl only to see ... her loving-but-worried husband. Come ON, okay?Likewise, the climax used some recycled chichés that should have been retired decades ago. Otherwise, this film is finely-finished, with well-drawn characterizations, and with strong reminiscences of the plotline and mood within the excellent ""Ghost Story"" (1981) and a tip of the hat to ""Rear Window"" (1954).The rating is nine, but I could have given it a ten had the wornout Grade-C shoulder-touching business and similar childishness been omitted.

161,dalton2,What lies beneath is that this is another entertaining film.,6,8 December 2000,"Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, a music very (very) similar to The Sixth Sense's, suspenseful scenes, mistery... all the ingredients are there, and the entertainment is assured. I laughed three or four times at very funny scenes, and I also got scared and jumped out from my seat in another four or five ones. This is a nice film from the director of that masterpiece called Back To The Future and two wonderful films called Contact and Forrest Gump, among others. His talent is present in many of the scenes, in the camera moves, in the way the scary elements appear. But there are also several things I disliked, i.e. the so predictable and cliché ending and the lack of plot throughout the whole film. This film is in the last term an insipid film, but anyway it's well done and it's entertaining. 6 out of 10.",What Lies Beneath
162,Chuck-149,A waste of talent and time.,3,26 July 2000,"In 1994, I was very mad to see Forrest Gump win all those awards.  I can understand how people might have voted Tom Hanks as best actor of the year but I was sure to see The Shawshank Redemption walk away with the best picture Oscar and Quentin Tarantino with the best director Oscar for Pulp Fiction.  Instead, Forrest Gump won best picture and Robert Zemeckis won best director for his work there.  Since then, his only work has been 1997's Contact.  Before Forrest Gump, he had done some good movies like the Back To The Future trilogy, Romancing The Stone (1985), and my favorite Zemeckis movie, Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988).  So walking into the cinema, I was expecting some good work from this director.  But after having seen What Lies Beneath, I guess his Oscar victory in 1994 was his once in a lifetime 15 minutes of fame because he sure won't win one for this movie. 
  The movie is not really terrible but it lacks originality and I mean a lot of originality.  This movie is a mix of Scream (1996), Fatal Attraction (1987), and Cape Fear (1991).  It also resembles Copycat (1995) in the way that the attempted murder is recreated the same way as the original murder. It has some of Scream's suspense and surprise attacks, Cape Fear's revenge and haunting aspect, and Fatal Attraction's dishonesty towards a wife and jealousy and threats from the mistress.    So if you have seen none of the four movies above, you might consider this movie to be very original and suspensful but as soon as you see them, even if it after, you will realize how What Lies Beneath seems to have big chunks of these four movies thrown into the script and all mixed up together by the direction.  The final negative part of the movie is the acting.  Granted, Harrison Ford is good, but his role becomes serious only in the final forty-five minutes or so of the movie.  The biggest acting disappointment comes from Michelle Pfeiffer who is simply not credible as the haunted and terrified wife.  A few of the supporting performances are good (like the next door neighbors and the psychiatrist) but too many of the friends' of Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are not quite credible either. 
  The story is good though.  A married wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) suspects her next door neighbor of having murdered his wife and soon comes to realize she is wrong.  But when strange things begin happening in her house, she gets scared and finally finds out that a spirit is haunting her house.  She discovers Harrison Ford has had an affair with another woman and that the spirit that is haunting her house is the spirit of the woman with whom Ford has had the affair and she comes to suspect him of having murdered her and starts fearing he might be planning to murder her.   You're probably thinking, ""So what?  It copies a few movies and has a few bad performances.  Why couldn't we recommend this movie to someone else""? What makes me unable to give a slight recommendation for the movie is Zemeckis's direction.  The way he handles the camera is way too predictable as we see the camera going one hundred and eighty degrees around the head of one of the actors.  This movement means that at the end of the spin of the camera, there will most likely be another person next to the actor whose head was used to turn the camera around.  What could have been a good movie turns out to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year up to now. Too much of a copy of many movies and too predictable.",What Lies Beneath

And Again .....,4,10 March 2021,"So much has been written about 'What Lies Beneath' (pro and con) that it's hard to provide new information, a new slant. But here goes.I like Michelle Pfeiffer. And everyone likes Harrison Ford. Team them up and a film's got to go out of its way to receive a negative review from me. But this film does, and it does for three reasons.(1) 'What Lies Beneath' must hold the record for the longest time between our discovering 'Who Done It' and the film's actual conclusion. There were still some forty minutes left to the film, a time during which the murderer seemingly dies again and again but each time struggles back to life and attempts to kill some more. It is like a spoof of Horror Films of the past where the monster refuses to succumb. But this is no monster; it's a human murderer we have here.And (2) The creepy neighbors next door. The couple exhibit massive shifts of personality with each new scene. From loving, to fearful, to comically endearing. It's as if the screenwriter did not know the actual role of these two when the production was already underway and so had to alter their relationship once the screenplay was completed.Finally, (3) Ghosts are O.K. I suppose they've got a story-telling reason for being. And in this film what ghosts there may be do their job. They frighten the still-living and, at times, frighten us. But - and this is just my opinion - that's it for ghosts. Ghosts cannot 'save the day'. A ghost cannot be the film's true hero or villain. If only because that would be too easy a way out for the screenwriter. And someone should have told this to the screenwriter. Or Director, Robert Zemekis. Who really should have known better.",What Lies Beneath

In some of the scenes he doesn't show everything but hints and let us work it on our own. I admit that some of the tricks, that made me jump, were what I call ""cheap tricks"", but they were used to good effect.The reason I think it's only a good movie and not an excellent one is because of some big holes in story which were left unsolved through the whole movie.Good performances from all cast including Ford(who plays a different role than usual) and Pfieffer. In short you may enjoy it if you go but on the other hand it's not everybody type of movie.",What Lies Beneath

There are certain elements that I liked. The premise of the danger came from within, or from someone unexpected. The problem I have with this is it is so terribly long, or at least it feels like it. The film wasn't even at it's halfway point and I was already checking the time. I swear it felt long. The suspense wasn't very nail-biting or chilling as I had hoped. The falling action was exciting, which that was cool. But everything before made me bored, and as a result this film falls flat for me. I don't recommend it.",What Lies Beneath
167,rsternesq,giving credit where it is due,9,16 November 2008,This is Michelle Pfiffer's movie and even though she is so distractingly gorgeous that she often doesn't get credit for being a good actress. She is and she proves it here. Any number of actors could have played the husband but she does a magnificent job with the wife. In watching Door in the Floor I recall wondering how that movie would have played with Michelle Pfiffer as the wife and I think it would also have demonstrated her chops as an actress to be reckoned with. A bit of Gena Rowlands in the mix makes it impossible to ignore that unforgettable face and you have a very fine movie held together by a very fine actress who could hold my attention in a still photograph but doesn't rest on the beauty of that face but puts a lot of emotion into this portrayal. Lots of wow power here. Catch it whenever you can.,What Lies Beneath

I also liked Zemekis' style with the camera works, having the cameras moving through solid matter like doors and cars and floors.The special effects in this movie, unlike ""The Haunting"", were used to tell the story in a way, and weren't the least bit distracting, but rather effective.P.S.

169,Anyanwu,"In the words of Chino from the Deftones, suck suck suck suck.",3,30 July 2000,"This movie sucked. I don't usually go off on such a freshman like tirade but it did. Suspense? Thriller? Where was it? Virtually nothing, I mean nothing, happens for the first 2 hrs. As Kevin Kline says in a Fish Called Wanda- Disappointed! The only really cool thing that happens is how the entity manifests itself. How it presents itself to the living is very stylized and subtle. For that alone I gave it a 3. But if I were to match this against say the Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes or dare I say is Tesis, this doesn't even come close. WLB follows Hitchcock by the numbers on many points. Shower curtains, eyeballs, even one of the principles is named Norman, and there is nothing wrong with that it's just that the film has got to have some balls, something that puts fear in your hearts. Maybe I am tainted in some way. I saw little old women jumping half out of their seats on some of the earlier suspense points of the film. But, I just did not get it. If anyone out there can give me a film that will give me that suspense or thrill that we all want please suggest something, please. But don't suggest one of those blockbuster, big budget, big studio types. They never do the job. Or maybe I should say the do not do the job like Hitchcock did.",What Lies Beneath
170,darkjosh,Not Much Underneath,5,27 January 2001,"Many will claim that Zemeckis blatant use of Hitchcockian themes and staples in What Lies Beneath make it a throwback to thrillers of yesteryear, but if that's the case, why not watch a Hitchcock movie, since What Lies Beneath derives from all of the master's films?Michelle Pfeiffer stars as Claire Spencer, wife to brilliant doctor Harrison Ford (Norman Spencer).  Residing in beautiful, rural Vermont, the two seem to have a perfect life until Claire starts having visions of a drowned girl throughout the home.Moving slower than an old woman driving through LA traffic, the first hour and a half of the film is exhaustingly tired, and all the necessary cliches to annoy are in place: loud ringing phones, Pfeiffer over-reactions to everyday noises, wind blowing through windows, etc.  The opening is especially out of place, with Pfeiffer and Harrison bidding farewell to daughter, a character who never again resurfaces except to use as a crutch to explain things or invoke sympathy at the film's climax. 
Not only does the screenplay borrow heavily from Rear Window and Psycho, but it's also lax in character development.  All performances feel wooden, with Ford going through the motions, save for Pfeiffer, who fares best and makes the entire thing durable.The ending, though effectively tense but undone by the Psycho theme butchered and ripped in the loud score, is too terse and leaves many unanswered questions.  Hitchcock fans should stick to Hitchcock, and though there are a couple of decent scares and thrills through it's plodding three-quarters, the film really begins picking up steam towards its not-so-grand finale.  Still, it's worth Pfeiffer's turn as the strong Claire to watch.5 out of 10",What Lies Beneath

Always been a Harrison Ford fan ever since he made the Kessel-run in 12 parsecs lol, could give or take Pfieffer but she is a good actor, no doubt, and quite hot for an older chick...anyway It's very Hitchcock-inspired, so if you like that sort of creepiness check it out...otherwise you're not missing anything TOO special...has a great ""feel"" to it if you know what i mean...probably not...im weird.Quick gripe before I go...

174,malcp,"Soggy in parts, but no damp squib",7,15 November 2012,"There are some really good shocks in this film, but frustratingly, things are just a little bit overdrawn and often far too clear cut. In my view the best horror films trade on suspense as much as possible, which means keeping your audience guessing about what is happening until you absolutely have to reveal something. With this film that should have meant totally convincing us that Claire was going insane - and her accident should have provided a very plausible explanation right until the very end of the film. Instead the truth is revealed rather lamely, and then, once we begin to know for certain what's happening and why, it all gets a big slow - in fact I'm sure I've seen most of this part of the film done better in a Creepy Tales comic book years ago. Whatever the flaws in the story, this is by far the best performance I've seen from Michelle Pfeiffer, and she really does amplify the best of the shocks, but Harrison Ford, although playing very strongly against type is far less convincing, I'm not sure if it's his dialogue or the plausibility of a character with such contradictory morals.

While not showing it for most of the movie, you know there's someone, or something there.Overall, if you're wanting a movie that will have you thinking, and guessing, all the way through, I believe this is the perfect fit.

176,jiangliqings,"Scary, suspenseful, and very entertaining.",10,15 January 2001,"*** out of ****What Lies Beneath is an effective entry into the horror genre (though it's basis lies more in the roots of Hitchcock and suspense/thrillers in general), which has been collapsing under the strain of terrible teen-based films.  This time, we have Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, two fine middle-aged performers who are both in top form here.  So is Robert Zemeckis, whose 3 year hiatus has grown a build-up for his fans-including me-out there expecting some quality cinema, and while this film isn't the classic his previous 2 were (Forrest Gump and Contact), it's far better than what a lot of critics have given it credit for.Norman and Claire Spencer (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, respectively) are a happily married New England couple whose grown-up daughter just left home for college.  Claire is getting adjusted to that fact, at the same time trying to get adjusted to the new house they've just moved into.To get her mind off her troubles, Claire decides to meet their neighbors, another married couple, James and Mary Feur.  But Claire begins to suspect there's something wrong in the Feur household.  First, she notices Mary sobbing uncontrollably and trying to hide from her husband when he returns home from work.  Then, one night she sees the husband put in a giant bag into the car, large enough to fit a person.  Her observations for the next few days lead her to believe that the husband has killed his wife, and her beliefs are only heightened when she believes there's ghost inside her house trying to tell her something.  I'm trying to be a little vague about the film, simply because it's a lot better not to know the plot twists and turns.  The trailers gave too much away, and thus led me to correctly predict the film's big plot twist even before I actually went to see the movie.  But that isn't the movie's flaw, and I'm sure that the twist would be surprising for the uninitiated.This is Robert Zemeckis' first foray in this genre, and he does a superb job.  Even though the jump scenes-of which there are a huge amount of-may seem a little obvious, it's only Zemeckis paying homage to films of the past.  And when they're as well-executed as it was in this film, those scenes can be very effective (lots of people actually screaming in the theater). Zemeckis also creates one magnificent set piece involving a bathtub (you'll know when you see it).  This is the sort of sequence that reminds me of Brian De Palma, in which camerawork, the acting, and the situation itself-little to no special effects-are all that's used to create suspense.  I've noticed a lot of complaints about the finale, which some found interfered with the tone and pacing of the previous 110 minutes.  The film was derided for switching from a ghost story to something similar in Fatal Attractions.  There is some truth in that, but the finale is also thrilling and suspenseful, thus lessening any sort of true negative impact it might have had if the scenes were less competently executed.The only 2 performers who are given a substantial amount of screen time are Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer, and both are terrific.  Ford as the loving husband is always convincing and Pfeiffer as the woman who thinks she could either be going out of her mind or actually witnessing a supernatural phenomena is equally good.  The film is really hers, though, since she's the one that does the investigation while the others have doubts about what she's saying.  The supporting performances are from Joe Morton as a pyschiatrist and Diana Scarlid as Claire's best friend are decent, though neither are given a lot of screen time.  James Remar as the husband who may or may not have killed his wife is chilling in the scenes he does appear in. The amount of critical bashing What Lies Beneath received leads me to believe that some people view this movie with too much of a harsh eye and need to believe that every film of this sort absolutely has to be unpredictable.  To some respect, I can agree with the critics who say the first 2/5 of the movie is perfunctory, but only to a certain point.  This is a far too enjoyable thriller for me to criticize substantially.To be honest, Clark Gregg's script doesn't have an ounce of originality in it.  The storyline is quite reminiscent of last year's Stir of Echoes.  But originality really doesn't matter that much in comparison to how well it's executed.  And in the case of What Lies Beneath, you have a very well-crafted thriller that was easily one of the best films of summer 2000 in a season of weak entries.",What Lies Beneath
177,Clothahump,Great work by two pros,10,24 July 2000,"This is a great show.  Spooky in all the right places, great visual effects and a sterling job of acting done by two of the best.

178,Paul-271,Rather boring and banal,1,24 June 2006,"This really was a terrible movie saved only by its unintentional howlers. As others have said, the entire production seems to be a sort of bizarre quilt of a movie rather than a cogently produced whole.The scare part of of the movie is created by fiddling with the decibel level of the music with or without a jump shot. In other words, cheap tricks. The only other scary parts of the movie are more cringes as the lead female steps on glass or gets splinters on a fence and that sort of stuff.The howlers are legion. One character is paralyzed by drugs, hardly able to move on minute, but the next is sprinting in full coordination. That's just as well because another character gets brained, falls down some steep stairs, then he too is able to spring up and participate in a decathlon. OK, that decathlon isn't really in the movie, but it could be. Another, even more grievously hurt character also participates in fight which creates some unintentional comic relief right at the end. Yeah, I can go on and on.The final twist isn't too twisted, and in fact, is predictable with the race and gender of the villain as stereotyped as race profiling of any police force ever is. How dreary.Unlike others, I didn't even like the sets all that much, but they weren't terrible by any means. Worth a look if only to laugh along with.",What Lies Beneath
179,comquest,Disappointingly Tame Thriller,6,16 April 2001,"Considering the cast (Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer are among my favorite actors), I expected 'What Lies Beneath' to be an engaging, intelligent thriller.  I was dreadfully disappointed. 
Despite excessive hype by the studio, this flick just isn't very scary!  It often moves so slowly that whatever momentum had been built was repeatedly lost.  The late Alfred Hitchcock could have taken this same cast and storyline, and produced yet another classic thriller.  But, alas, Hitchcock was unavailable.  What we end up with is just an alright movie that leaves the viewer with little, if any, residual effect.  Too bad.",What Lies Beneath

But really, 'What Lies Beneath' has little to do with the very good thriller 'The Sixth Sense'. It's more like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' for the Babyboomer set. Here we have an older, attractive couple- amusingly enough, the Ford-Pfeiffer pairing seems to be an honest attempt to cast a woman old enough for the male lead, and there's still a 14 year age difference. At least H.F. and M.P. are good in their fairly one-dimensional roles. Anyway, one of them 'did' a bad thing and of course it's going to come back and haunt them. 'It' is a young woman that has disappeared, and Agent Michelle is on the case. 'What Lies Beneath' has got a lot of jump scenes- complete with musical spikes- and a couple of genuine thrills, but I think I would have enjoyed this movie a lot more if I hadn't correctly guessed the ending 45 minutes in.",What Lies Beneath
181,rhefner2002,Silly in every possible way,2,4 October 2019,"This is an interminably long soap opera involving two people for whom we care nothing: a rich, over-privileged white couple living in a beautiful house on a lake in Vermont. He's a brilliant scientist who chairs a department at an upscale college; she's a brilliant classical cellist who has given up her career for marriage and a kid. She suspects a ghost in the house, and he tries to patronize her, sending her to a shrink.
Are you ready to walk away yet?There's more: Director Robert Zemeckis not only borrows from Hitchcock--spying on the neighbors with binoculars (Rear Window), and a woman jumping into the water in an apparent suicide attempt (Vertigo)__but he also borrows from William Castle with the recurring bathtub schtick and the old standard ""doors mysteriously opening by themselves"" routine (The Tingler). And there's even a Ouija board scene (13 Ghosts).There's more: We're supposed to be shocked at the twist in the last half hour, but any 12 year old kid could have predicted it.There's even more: The film drags on forever with a string of horror movie cliches: a candle blowing out by itself: pictures falling off of bookcases inexplicably: a ghost appearing in a mirror behind the protagonist; lots of gloomy rain, wind, and fog; and a mysterious necklace (Vertigo again).There's even more: It's obvious that Harrison Ford and Michele Pfeiffer are just earning a paycheck. Incredibly, they manage to get through the film with straight faces.Have I convinced you to avoid this piece of Hollywood dreck?

Now that it's finally available on Netflix, I become bothered by the fact that in spite of the 130 minutes of running time, the movie feels too prolonged due to many scenes feel so unnecessary.The main focus here is how the woman must unravel a mystery while all seem doubt her sanity. This is not a new premise and its little humorous approach in the beginning makes the movie looks smart. However, up until the climax, it gets really boring because most of the thrilling scenes are mostly a buildup for like one or two minutes which getting overused because they used it for like 30 minutes.The ending dissatisfied me so much it makes me overlook positive things in the movie, like the acting, the suspense, and the dialogues. Then again, the premise is pretty thin so unless you a fan of the actors or the director, I think you could find other options with similar premise and shorter running time.",What Lies Beneath
184,flickjunkie-3,Possibly One Of The Top 10 Scariest Movies I Have Ever Seen...,8,15 December 2000,"*Warning: Some Major Spoilers*What Lies Beneath had a brief trailer and I hadn't heard much about it, so, when I went to see it, I was a bit unsure about what I was about to see. Fortunately, I largely enjoyed myself in this mysterious horror film.The film opens with Norman and Claire Spencer (played to perfection by Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer) sending Claire's daughter away to college. Claire fears being alone in the house, but soon grows to the idea because she feels she will have her life back again. One day, while sitting on her terrace, she hears a woman crying next door, and upon investigation of the events of her new neighbors, she begins to wonder if the husband has killed his wife. Meanwhile, in her own house, strange occurrences, such as breaking pictures, opening doors and whispering voices lead her to believe that a ghost, possibly her ""dead"" neighbor, is trying to contact her. Claire soon discovers that all she thinks has happened is not at all true, with her neighbour very much alive and happy again. But the apparitions still permeate throughout the house, filling bathtubs and turning off lights. As Claire begins to dig into ""who"" is trying to contact her, she discovers that her husband had an affair with a young woman. Claire confronts Norman about the woman, and he tells her that the girl committed suicide when he tried breaking off the relationship. But that is not the end of Claire's journey, for she will soon discover that even the perfect husband has flaws.The acting is near perfection, Michelle Pfeiffer deserves an Academy Award for her brilliant and masterful performance, but Harrison Ford surprisingly takes a back seat for most of the film, until the last 30 minutes, where his character really breaks out into something evil, Claire discovers why Norman has been trying to keep his secret for so long. The direction is very satisfying, Zemeckis builds up so much tension, What Lies Beneath is one of the only films I have ever screamed in. Two really scary parts are the binocular scene and the horrifying bath-tub sequence.A film not to be missed, What Lies Beneath is possibly one of the scariest movies of our time. And a cracker mystery...I rate What Lies Beneath 8 out of 10.",What Lies Beneath

It is so predictable that their is no suspense through the entire film. Plus, if you've seen the trailer you have seen the entire movie in under three minutes. The trailer gives away key plot points that do not come up in the film until almost the end. The acting is subpar. Michelle Pfeiffer is an overrated actress- she rarely embodies any of the characters she plays (the only two good performances she ever gave were in BATMAN RETURNS and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE). Harrison Ford always plays Harrison Ford in his films, and this is proof why. As soon as he takes a role that is different from his screen persona, he turns into a pathetic actor. This is the worst work he has ever done. The screenplay is like a mixture of all the great Hitchcock films, but unlike the other film that did that (Kenneth Branagh's brillant DEAD AGAIN), this film lacks all the charm and suspense of those films. This is the worst film I have seen all year!!!",What Lies Beneath
188,Rhythmbandit,Totally Brilliant and Full of Suspence,10,20 October 2001,What Lies Beneath is a great movie. Its a horror movie which has less gore and more screams which works very effectively. The plot goes along at a steady un nerving pace which is great. The references to some movies are so obvious and the music at the end was used in Psycho. This is one of the best horror movies i have seen in quite a while. If you dont see it you must see it or rent the video or better still...buy it. It really is great and faultless. Harrison Ford and Michelle Phieffer are a great on screen couple and they couldnt have got a better couple to appear. 10/10If you like this try:PsychoThe HauntingHouse on Haunted Hill,What Lies Beneath

It is a bit predictable at times, there are a few jumps scares, and you better believe that they are as annoying here. The acti g is pretty good. Pheifer is great as usual, has to portrayal a lot of fear and potential I sanity and nails it. Ford is a bit wooden, yet still pulls tough in the right moments. The suspense is what makes this though, it has genuine nail-biting scenes, Zemeckis has easily drawn some inspiration from Hitchcock. This is especially true in a certain bath scene.The problems I have come down to writing. I feel this one could havbenefitteded from some more tighter pacing' sts also not very or original, with ghost story cliches going all the way to rigid board.

192,mercury-26,great...if it were a made-for-television movie,4,29 July 2000,"Zemeckis must have gone to Barnes and Noble and bought `Making the Suspense Thriller...for Dummies.' He then went into the NBC vault of rejected made-for-television movie scripts and picked a simple little ghost story to try his hand at. He follows the book faithfully and gets all of the tricks right: the get-the-audience-to-think-one-thing-is-going-to-scare-them-then-scare-them-with-something-else trick, for instance. He likes this trick so much in fact, he uses it like, ten times. Chapter three, part two, paragraph one of `...for Dummies' reads, `set film in big, creepy New England house by a lake.' Got it.""What Lies Beneath"" is sufficiently creepy, scary in mood only, well photographed and well acted. Heck, the writing is even pretty good. It's all ruined, unfortunately, by cliches and a stupid ending. The story begins with a shook up housewife, Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her brilliant scientist husband (Harrison Ford) living in a quiet lakeside community. Claire overhears the woman next door crying in fear of her life, then witnesses what she thinks is the woman's husband loading a cadaver into the trunk of his car (in a pouring rain storm, of course). Claire then thinks she's seeing ghosts. The audience is supposed to think that it's the neighbor's ghost that's haunting her. This never fooled me for a second because I've seen this story line a thousand times before, so the first half hour of the film is wasted.Even if the movie's trailer hadn't ruined many of the plot's twists and turns, any idiot could guess what was going to happen at any given point in the film anyway. It's constantly looking to surprise you, but rarely does. This is because not one thing happens in the story that you can say you've never seen before.  Instead of trying to go in different directions than we're used to in creepy supernatural murder mysteries, the movie falls back on more used up, tired suspense thriller conventions, such as the frail heroine stepping over the unconscious body of her attacker. Will he wake up and grab her? Well, what happened the last fifty times you saw this scene in a movie?I actually would have been happy with this film and given it a passing grade had they just ended it with the best scene in the movie: Claire has been given a drug that paralyzes her while leaving her fully conscious, and the bathtub she's sitting in is filling with water. The way it was done creates about as suspenseful a scene as any good suspense movie has to offer. It really feeds all the senses, with some cool sound design and inspired photography. It also provides the movie's only legitimate jump-out-of-your-seat jolt. But Zemeckis isn't content to leave it at that, closing with a big, dumb, disappointing action sequence. What would a Harrison Ford film be without him hanging off the back of a moving vehicle?Zemeckis continues to be a reliable director and does solid work here. Pfeiffer and Ford also perform as well as you've ever seen them. In the end, though, all parties probably should have steered clear of this one.What lies beneath? Unfortunately, nothing all that interesting.Grade: C-",What Lies Beneath

195,Verbal-17,Possibly the scariest movie I've ever seen,10,25 July 2000,"In terms of simple shock value, ""What Lies Beneath"" ranks right up there with the best of them. Seeing the previews for the movie, I wondered why such great and famous Hollywood stars as Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer, and director Robert Zemekis would get involved with a horror movie. After the movie was over, I knew why. It isn't so much a movie as an experience in fright. Zemekis throws everything but the kitchen sink at us, including every horror cliche in the book: the dead body that may not be actually dead, the reflection of seeing someone else behind you, the noise that turns out to be a family pet, etc (believe me, these aren't any real spoilers- this all takes place within the first 45 minutes or so, and the movie's over 2 hours long). The plot basically consists of Pfeiffer walking around the house alone, then something jumps out at her (and us), and the same gag is repeated again and again. It's at first scary, then frustrating (because we know it's coming but can't do anything about it), and finally in the last act achieves a kind of over the top grandeur that few scary movies have approached (The Shining, Psycho, Halloween, and Wait Until Dark come to mind). I'm definitely going to see it again (now that I know where the scares are, I can watch everybody else in the theater squirm in their seats). I suggest you see it too- just make sure you have something to grab on to.",What Lies Beneath
196,spencer-w-hensley,A lot slower than I remembered but worth watching for Pfieffer's performance and great cinematography,7,19 May 2021,"Re-watched this for the first time in about 10 years. Having been on a binge of re-watching Michelle Pfieffer films, surprisingly this has been one of only very few films that was a box-office success for her so I felt that alone was worth a rewatch.And who doesnt want to see her alongside the great Harrison Ford and direction from Robert Zemeckis who has directed some of the all time greatest films?Well for all involved this movie is definitely not among their best but it works and the main reason why is because of Pfieffer's performance.Of course Ford is top-billed but this is really Pfieffer's movie she really is the main star and her performance in this is so strong that the movie works as a result.The pacing is very slow. Zemeckis has probably not directed a slower-paced movie since the second half of Back to the Future Part II.Nonetheless the story is an interesting one to keep you involved in spite of the slow pacing.Ford seems to be phoning in his performance here until the last half of the movie. Not to say his performance is bad but he just cannot hold a candle to Pfieffer who seems to have the most range here.And I am not complimenting Pfieffer's performance based solely on her beauty. Yes she is one of the most beautiful women alive, but her beauty is totally irrelevant to the strength of her performance in this film. She is just simply magnificent as an actress here regardless of her looks.The cinematography is also wonderful with truly beautiful Vermont scenery.It's hard to understand out of some great films that Michelle Pfieffer has been in why this is one of few that was a true box office success. Not to say this is a bad film by any means but she has been in better films that didnt do as well as this one did which is a shame because she obviously is someone with lots of talent, and she is more than capable of drawing big crowds to her films.Many refer to this as a horror film but I would say it is more of a mystery suspense thriller. I just wasnt really scared by what happened onscreen.Again the story is interesting enough to not keep you bored.I wish the chemistry between Ford and Pfieffer were stronger and Ford gave as equally impressive a performance here as Pfieffer did but again it is nice to see Pfieffer use her talent to the best of her advantage.Worth a watch for Pfieffer and the cinematography but expect the pacing to be slow while not boring, dont expect Ford to give one of his very best performances and dont expect a horror movie and you should enjoy it for what it is.This cast and director have all done much better but it's a movie that is worth at least one watch. It definitely has some goods to offer and that is more than enough when said and done.",What Lies Beneath
197,cooper-29,Good chiller,8,22 July 2000,"SPOILER ALERT I do agree that the previews gave away some of the surprises and I wish It hadnt. can you imagine the twist finding out that Harrisons character had actullly had an affair instead of knowing the secret going in. It would been a neat twist. Still there are some nice twists left. I knew going in that Zemeckis would do a good film and wouldnt let me down. I think out of all his movies Ive never been let down...well maybe a little with Contact but he hAs a great track record. This films pace is one of the things I liked about it. I dont think the story lends itself to ""Fast"" Hollywood scary movie. This reminded me a lot of those 70 thriller movies I used to watch on TV where the tension was mounting and you knew something was going to happen but not when. I was imprssed with the spookiness that you usually dont get anymore from most Horror movies. I loved Pheiffer and Ford was good and I like the different angle that he gets to play instead of the ""Indy"" type character he always plays. I also liked the false plots that lead nowhere like old Hitchcok movies that keep you guessing. The only thing I didnt like was the false Michael Meyers/Jason Vorhees fake death scenes towards the end when you think the killer is dead and they keep getting up. I could have done without that but overall I really liked the movie and recommend you seeing it.",What Lies Beneath
198,joshfedderson,Secrets can come back to Haunt You,10,5 August 2017,"This movie is very chilling, it's one of the mystery/horror movies that keep you hooked to the very end. And that's what ""What Lies Beneath"" did for me.The story goes like this, a woman named claire Spencer has the life she has always wanted, a nice house, a good husband, and a daughter. One day her daughter goes off to college. As time passes by strange things start to happen. Doors are opening, electronics are turning on, things fall and break in the house. Overtime it gets worse, claire starts seeing the figure of a girl in the house and she is convinced that it's a ghost trying to harm her. Others don't really believe her, especially her husband Norman Spencer. Claire wanting to prove of the ghost presence, starts performing rituals and spiritual communications. It works but no one still does not believe her. As memories come flooding back, Claire starts putting the pieces together and it eventually leads to her husband. Who for many years has kept a deep dark secret.Something he has kept hidden has come back. Secrets can come back to haunt you.This is not your ordinary ghost story, this story proves that secrets should not be kept hidden.I like this movie because of the story and the way it slowly plays out. I like the mystery of the story, how claire puts it all together and the creepiness of it all. Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford play their parts really well, and the woman who plays the ghost, Amber Valletta,does a really good and creepy job of it. One night I watched this alone and I couldn't go to sleep, it was that creepy for me.I am giving ""What Lies Beneath"" a 10. For the story, the creepiness, and deep dark secret that is so well hidden it really surprises you when claire finds out. I wish they would make more movies like this, a good classic ghost story with a mystery behind it. A story about secrets that can come back to haunt you, no matter how hard you try to hide them.",What Lies Beneath
199,Lamia7609,*spoilers*,8,4 September 2001,"I personally loved this film. Especially since it made my boyfriend yell. I've never seen him jump before it was quite funny. I enjoyed the pacing. There were problems with the plot. For example, there really was no purpose to finding the necklace. It was a lousy plot device.  If she had found the necklace after finding the key and then visited the girl's mother and saw her wearing the necklace it would have made more sense. I knew the neighbor situation was a red herring. Even though it was predictable I still got chills and was scared. Few movies creep me out. Seven and Silence of the Lambs were both movies that made me ill at ease and I felt sort of tainted. I don't enjoy those feelings and so have no plans to watch those films again. I do enjoy the 6th sense, poltergeist, the changeling, and other movies that explore hauntings. I think I prefer supernatural evil to man made evil. The existance of ghosts prove that there is an after life. The existance of Hannibal the cannibal proves that if there isn't a hell there should be.",What Lies Beneath
200,VivienLeighsnumber1fan,"Does for Tubs, what showers did for Psycho!",9,14 May 2002,"To call What Lies Beneath Hollywood's most self-conscious tribute to Alfred Hitchcock is by no means an understatement. Elements of, amongst scores of others, Rear Window, Rope, Notorious, North by Northwest, Vertigo and, of course, Psycho, combine in terms of plot and visuals to make a thoroughly absorbing story that is as classic in its narrative as its masterful cinematic style. Everything about this film harks back to the 40's and 50's way of doing things, whilst simultaneously using advanced technology to take that style and project it into the present day. Indeed, every single shot feels like Zemeckis said to himself: how would Hitchcock have filmed this? What would he have done if he had the technology we have? With more than a few allusions to the old master himself (grabbing the shower-curtain when falling out of the bath, for example), the result, understandably, is stunning.With so much going on in every scene, it is difficult to talk concisely about this film. Throughout, there is much to marvel over in the cinematography, editing, soundtrack; the chills come thick and heavy, the mystery sucks you in, the visual brilliance astounds at every turn. The claustrophobia of the house, the realism of Ford and Pfeiffer's relationship and the intrigues that surround the central characters pale into insignificance beside the pure ingenuity of the filmmaking. In a single take, Pfeiffer leaves the bathroom, the bath empty, walks around for a minute, and re-enters the same bathroom, now filled with steam, the bath full, before discovering a message written on the mirror. In the final sequence, the camera darts in and out of CGI cars, offering shots that Hitchcock could only dream about, and yet the whole set-piece screams of 50's classicism. In the creepiest bathroom sequence since Psycho, we are offered the POV of a drowning woman, in a scene that deserves to go down in film history as one of the best-constructed examples of film technique ever seen. In some scenes, the camera even drops suddenly through the floor, to look up through glass at the actors above. For fans of film aesthetics, there is no doubting that this is one of the finest experiments to grace the screens. I see shades of ""Fatal Attraction"" with the whole tub sequence. Oh, how I love tubs like that! And, I just love the scenes where she drains the tub, and the slow, eerie music as she's about to drown.Admittedly, if you are not a fan of Hitchcock or have never seen a Hitchcock, much of the enjoyment can be taken out of the film. The story plods along at first, only really picking up momentum half-way through. However, that said, the final half-hour more than makes up for any lack of pace in the early reels. If nothing else, it is great to see Ford in a role that is the opposite of what we have come to expect from him. Overall, anyone who considers themselves a serious film fan needs to own a copy of this film. And if you've never seen Hitchcock, there is no finer introduction to the man than this movie. Buy it and love it. It's as simple as that. A must!!

I think it is one really good movie.Acting: The acting was great, but thats what you get when you hire 2 amazing actors to be husband and wife in a movie together. Both harrison and michelle did such a good job.Plot: The plot is great. Great story and it moves along just fine. Its creepy and 10 years ago it was even more creepy. The struggle/ action shots are very well don't, they are very believable and not all fake looking. I really would recommend this movie to any one that likes creepy, thriller mystery.I i was going to pair this movie with another movie to watch in one evening. I would choose the secret window.",What Lies Beneath

Strange and mysterious possibly guilty neighbours are also present in their life.The end is too predictable that any spectator could write since the real beginning.

206,Extraordinary_Machine,"A surprisingly stale thriller, full of red herring subplots and cheap ""jump"" scares...",4,13 April 2005,"What Lies Beneath Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer play a seemingly happily married couple who uncover a terrible secret...a secret so disturbing it threatens to destroy them. When Claire Spencer begins seeing ghostly images and hearing mysterious voices in their home, her husband Norman suspects it's just her imagination - until the images turn real. Now, together they must uncover the truth, confront their worst fears and find ""what lies beneath""...with twisting and terrifying results.Considering 'What Lies Beneath' is directed by Robert Zemeckis, the fact that it is so run-of-the-mill and, well...dull, comes as quite a surprise. Maybe he isn't quite cut out for the thriller genre (see last year's mediocre 'House on Haunted Hill' remake, which he produced), but whatever the reason, this is a stale thriller, full of red herring subplots, cheap ""jump"" scares and a silly script that includes séances, possession, and a final couple of scenes taken right from some teen slasher film. Michelle Pfeiffer is okay, but there's only so much she can do. Harrison Ford sleepwalks through his role...what more can I say? There's a truly nail-biting sequence involving a character in a bathtub (I won't say more, but people who've seen the film will know what I mean), and it's truly the kind of stuff great thrillers are made from.

Well undecided is as undecided does.  The director takes all these genre and mixes them into one over-long not so thrilling story. Norman (Harrison Ford) and Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) are the perfect empty nester couple. Their daughter is off to college.  The only challenge in their life, other than his all-important presentation of his newest and greatest genetics discovery, is trying to out due the neighbor's coital caterwauling. Then out of nowhere, Claire begins to see murderers, ghosts and spousal infidelity. The middle half of the movie would have been suspenseful if I hadn't seen the trailers.   I knew what the movie was supposed to be about.  There are some good things.  The set design is beautiful (I'd love to have the house.) There is an element of humor when Claire goes to a physiatrist and when she and a friend use a Ouija Board to call up the ghost that is haunting her house.  But when you finally get to bottom of this movie, it's like a smorgasbord served in a bucket.",What Lies Beneath
208,emguy,Acting + Atmospherics + Hitchcock References,8,31 March 2001,"Some found this movie slow-moving, but I think of it as subtle instead - a small noise here, a small motion there, little startling moments, incidents where you're not sure whether Claire is imagining things or seeing reality, the gradual revelation of previous events. The scariness is in the situations and in a character's helplessness, not in over-the-edge gross-out effects.Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford both put in some good acting. (And Harrison Ford _must_ be a good actor if he can act uninterested when Michelle Pfeiffer in a nightgown climbs into bed with him, right? ;-)Hitchcock references kept appearing, such as: - Peering through the window at a neighbor suspected of killing his wife - An overhead shot of a character named ""Norman"" carrying an inert woman's body on the stairs - A woman tearing down the shower curtain as she collapses out of the shower",What Lies Beneath
209,Sam_Gray,a well executed cliche,7,29 December 2000,"There's something about the horror genre that draws me in and makes me see lots of its movies.  What's odd about that, though, is I almost always hate said movies or think them average at best (that are expections of course, such as The Sixth Sense, which is actually my favorite movie).  Luckily, What Lies Beneath isn't a bad film, but it's only slightly above that average mark.The most interesting thing about this film is the fact that Harrison Ford, despite getting top billing, is not the main character, and is very much secondary.  What Lies Beneath is Michelle Pfeiffer's show all the way, and she provides it a good performance.And thanks largely to Pfeiffer, the film is highly watchable.  However, although I doubt this was his intention, it feels a bit like Robert Zemeckis is imitating other directors, namely Alfred Hitchcock and M. Night Shyamalan.  I'm not the first to note comparisons to Hitchcock's Rear Window in the first half of the movie, and I'm sure I won't be the last.  The pacing is much like that of Shyamalan's work.  The problem is, when it comes to this kind of movie, Zemeckis is not as good as Hitchcock or Shyamalan.However, I did enjoy watching What Lies Beneath.  Obviously, it's nothing original or noteworthy, and it does have some horror movie cliches.  Still, it is a competent film for the most part, and fans of the director, leads, or the genre shouldn't mind risking a rental on this. 7/10",What Lies Beneath
210,zofos,A Hitchcockian Spine-Chiller,8,12 June 2008,"I don't think Alfred Hitchcock ever made a movie about ghosts, but if he did, it may have been something like ""What Lies Beneath."" The film is stuffed with references to Hitch's work with nods to ""Psycho,"" ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo."" The Master would have been chuckling to himself watching this in the theatre.Michelle Pfeiffer plays a woman suffering from ""empty nest"" syndrome after her daughter leaves home for college. Not long after this upsetting event, Michelle suddenly starts seeing and hearing strange things in her house. Is she going mad or is it something paranormal? Harrison Ford plays her rich scientist husband and he spends most of the time trying to figure out what is happening to his wife and cope with the changes in her behaviour.It's rare for a major Hollywood movie to star a middle-aged actress these days and even rarer for the heroine she's playing to be a lonely, depressed middle-aged woman (that must have been a tough sell to the studio!) and it's a refreshing change to see that.Michelle Pfeiffer looks stunning and is holding up well for her age (or rather her magnificent cheekbones are holding her age up well!). She's perfectly cast in the role of the Hitchcock blonde (Hitchcock would have LOVED Michelle Pfeiffer, she would have been right up his street).For me, this is one of Harrison Ford's best performances. You'll see him in a new light after this. It's a departure from the normal roles he plays.Robert Zemeckis does a great job as director as the film shifts gears from low-key psychological drama, to mystery thriller and into the area of the supernatural too. There are some spine-tingling twists and nerve-wracking moments of suspense that will have you on the edge of your seat.I remember going to see this in the cinema on a dull, chilly Sunday afternoon in October (perfect weather for watching a scary movie) with my late mother and my sister and we thoroughly enjoyed it. It became a family favourite on DVD later. Whenever I watch it now, I remember how much my mother liked it (she knew a good movie when she saw one!) and you will too. BOO!

211,Fredichi,More homages to Hitchcock,5,8 August 2000,"Every once and a while someone feels the need to do an homage to Hitchcock. All they end up doing is proving he was the master and imitations can't come close.But in all fairness this isn't a straight forward Hitch rip off. This is trying to be Sixth Sense as well. Not that they deserve any credit for this because in making it try to be these two things they ruined the movie. Or rather ruined its potential. Instead of a great mystery thriller with some authentic chills. We are left with a slow and obvious thriller with minor chills. The only scares come from those stupid ""no one there-then suddenly standing right behind"" kind of scares. Which is the absolutely cheapest kind of scare.Some of the ideas in the end were good. But it was too little too late. And they make the rest of the movie seem unnecessary. Of course Zemeckis has to bring out the CGI in the end. Completely not needed CGI. Waste of millions of dollars in effects. The music quite literally is the b****rd child of North by Northwest and Psycho.They just should of decided what the film was going to be...Hitchcock homage...or Sixth Sense rip-off. It didn't do either very well.Bottom line.  A little boring. Not very original. Very forgettable. The star power keeps it going.",What Lies Beneath
212,Aphex97,Almost a thriller...,6,10 June 2001,"This movie almost pulled it off. Excellent 1st hour set-up that is truly intriguing and creepy. However, the ""revealing"" is terribly lackluster and generally just not interesting. I was hoping, nay begging, for something more mysterious, more novel...anything more intriguing than the actual mundane revelation that occurred.Yes, yes its sad but true....there is no great payoff in this movie. Pfeiffer's character figures out too easily what the audience has figured out about 20 minutes before her. The bad guy's shift from perfect to crazed lunatic is too abrupt and not believable. Its really a shame the nice beginning set-up is spoiled by the ho-hum revelation and the standard Hollywood ending.Final Rating: 6/10- At least the first hour was fun...Noob Aalox",What Lies Beneath

She suspects that Mr. Feur had killed his wife and her fears become worst when something like a ghost begins to terrify her in the house. There are a lot of surprises in this movie (but the most astonishing in a ""important for the story of cinema"" way mustn't be told) first of all the passage of Robert Zemeckis from the comedy of ""Back To Future"" and ""Forrest Gump"" to the dark atmosphere of this thriller. ""What Lies Beneath"" mixes a lot of elements of famous thrillers and horrors of the past years: from Alfred Hitchcock takes the voyeurism of ""Rear Window"", from ""Les Diaboliques"" by Henri Georges Clouzot takes the basin like place of death and from ""The Turn Of The Screw"" by Henry James the ghosts and the subtle idea that the female protagonist had some mind problems.

214,mar9,"Attempted big splash, but in the end all wet",5,1 April 2002,"After a decent build-up and some well-constructed tingly moments, this promising thriller falls to bits in the final reel. What went wrong? It's difficult to say without major spoilage, but here goes...Harrison Ford is reasonably convincing in the early stages of this film and there's good chemistry between him and Michelle Pfeiffer, despite the 15-plus year age gap. As the film darkens, he becomes less convincing and begins to look out of his depth. A case of casting a box office certainty rather than an actor better suited to the role?Michelle Pfeiffer carries most of the first half of the film and does pretty well. If only she'd shown this much emotion in ""Wolf"". She tries hard at film's climax but is sadly hamstrung by a couple of daft plot devices.Back to that ending. Ugh, in a word. It simply doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. The first part of the film is a decent study of a woman dealing with the ""empty nest"" syndrome as her only child moves out to college and she is left alone in her house while her scientist husband pursues some high-powered research, spending most of his time at the office and even when he's at home, he's usually working. The haunting starts. Is it her imagination working overtime? When they renovated the house, did they forget to upgrade the wiring? Are the new neighbours weird (aside - Miranda Otto is tops but doesn't get nearly enough screen time)? The unfolding of the plot does not fit the early story development and the over-the-top, SFX-driven and much too long climax could almost belong to another film. As a result, another promising movie is dragged down to become merely ordinary, which is probably more disappointing than seeing a film that starts out average and stays there.",What Lies Beneath

Well, the whole movie was going just fine until Harrison Ford's character had to turn all bad.  I didn't really like that at all.  It was in sharp contrast to what we had been learning about his character till then.  After that I was thinking, ""Oh no...the same old horror story.""Otherwise, it did good in keeping the suspense alive and the constant tense atmosphere.  Michelle Pfeiffer was great.

This one has every cliche in the book with several ridiculous red herrings thrown to sufficiently cause eyes to roll. Plus, I hate jump scares. If you have a successfully scary movie, you don't need cheap jump scares to goose your audience. Yes, the production is first rate and the actors are A-list but everything about it I've seen before. And that awful endless heavily orchestrated soundtrack is yet another way to prop up a sagging script. I guess others may be more easily impressed. I was not. As it has been for decades in Hollywood productions, the only people worth building a story around are rich white 1%-ers, happy or suffering, funny or frightening, suspense or musical, I guess only white people are worth representing.

217,homer_simpson91,A very bad movie,3,14 December 2001,"One of the producers called WHAT LIES BENEATH ""the kind of film Hitchcock would have done in his day"". That statement makes me wonder if that producer has ever actually SEEN a Hitchcock movie before. Just because this movie rips-off of REAR WINDOW and PSYCHO ever once in a while, it does not make it anywhere near the caliber of a Hitchcock film. While a Hitchcock film is usually so intense it leaves you on the edge of your seat, WHAT LIES BENEATH instead is so boring you might be falling asleep. What's worse is that anybody who has seen the trailer (as I have) already knows what happens in the first hour and a half, destroying any possibility of being surprised up until the slightly more exciting, but far-fetched and equally as unsatisfying, ending. The only good thing about this movie are the two leads. Michelle Pfeiffer is alright, but certainly not at her best. Harrison Ford seems to be phoning it in until the last half hour, where he is very impressive as always. Robert Zemeckis (who is certainly NOT Alfred Hitchcock) does a decent director job, but a firm thumbs DOWN to Clark Gregg, who wrote this horrible screenplay. Unsurprisingly, it is his first.3/10",What Lies Beneath
218,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"I didn't have high hopes, so I guess I wasn't disappointed",6,9 August 2000,"I have a lot of problems with What Lies Beneath, the least of which was that the idiots who edited the previews gave away some key information about the movie, something that isn't revealed until a good hour into it! I swear to God, these people must live in caves in the woods. Y'know, it's one thing when you can figure out where the movie is headed as your watching it, but it's another when your told exactly what will happen. If it were a friend that told me about the surprises, I would slap them.This is a trend in Hollywood that I want to see taken care of right away.Okay, here's the deal, I don't dislike this movie but at the same time I can't really say that I liked it. I wasn't even going to bother seeing it because I could tell from the previews that I wasn't going to like it, but I got bullied into going so eventually I gave in and went to a matinee. My first reaction was, ""Could someone tell me when Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer got so old?"". They look positively ancient in this movie. I know Ford is getting up there in years, but I mean, Jesus! That's why they have make-up people. Dude is looking more and more like Yoda every day. Catwoman, where for art thou?My main problem is the scares. This movie has them, but it doesn't EARN them. I'm a bit of a horror movie connoisseur (well, not really, I just love them all), and the scares are just so damn predictable because you've seen them done in about a million other movies. When ever you see a reflective surface, you know something is going to appear when the camera pans over to give you a full view, when someone opens a door or cupboard and you can't see what's behind it, you know when they close it someone will be standing there, when a door slowly creeps open the thought on everyones mind is, ""Okay, will it be the dog or her husband?"", when you're looking threw a knothole in the fence, of coarse the most surprising thing your going to see is someone staring back at you. But it's not a surprise because you know what's going to happen. When I jumped a few times in this movie, it's not because I was terrified at what I was seeing on screen, I was just waiting for the sudden, loud burst of music to startle me. This movie only honestly earned a couple of it's scares, one toward the beginning and one toward the end. And what about that ending? Did anyone buy that, or was it just me? Hey, I like a good twist as much as the next guy, but this was really unbelievable. What a terrible script. This movie had one thing going for it, and his name is Robert Zemeckis, and I swear I'm not even a fan of his. Back to the Future is a classic, and Forrest Gump is a cute movie but way to syrupy for me. I think he could have done better with a decent script, and so could the stars in what was some very dull roles. But the paycheck cleared so everyone's happy I suppose. 6/10 stars it gets, not for being good, but for not sucking as bad as I thought. Not the most glowing endorsement for a movie, but it's all I can manage. G'night!",What Lies Beneath
219,FrankNSteinSinatra,Is just stupid,2,13 February 2020,"I learned that imdb-reviews are just opinions of amateurs.
Someone here recommendated this movie, because it should remind of ""Jacob's ladder (1990)"".
It does not.
""What lies beneath"" is an upper middle class ghost-entertainer. Being upper middle class is not bad in itself, ""the Exorcist"" was a superb movie.
The bad in itself is Michelle Pfeiffer overacting and very, very tired Harrison Ford mummbling throughout the film.
The director/sound editor/compositor is apparently fan of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear window"" and ""Vertigo"".
Despite that Pfeiffer´s character spends her days alone in a huge mansion, there is no visible a single gardener or domestic servant (in the whole suburb), there appears only high-class people. In the ""Exorcist"" and in even in the low-budget Roger Corman-movies there were servants, to create more realistic backgound and increase the amount of suspects.
So in this case we have an absent-minded Hollywood moneymaker, that costed absurdly 100 million $ to produce.(I also seriously started to suspect that production company´s ""thumbs-up-department"" is working here to create wrong impressions and fake reviews.

Ford and Pfeiffer are wonderful to watch but that's not enough to make this worth seeing in the theater (neither are the special effects). By the way, this is Pfeiffer's film, she has the dominant screen time and she sure looks great!!So what's wrong with ""What Lies Beneath""? (notice the word Lies is in the title)  Well, the first half of the film is NOTHING like how it was promoted in the trailers. The affair Ford had isn't exposed until we're way into the film (at least 1/2 way). In the mean time were lead on this wild goose chase that has NOTHING to do with the story, a true theft of audience time and trust.In all the promotions I saw, you're made aware of the affair and then lead to believe that a wife, possessed by the dead mistress, gives a frightened husband a run for his money.  The trailer even showed scenes of her investigating the paranormal that were not in the film (I hate that).  I kept wondering if the film I was seeing was the same one.I'm not sure why word of mouth for this film isn't worse, but it was nowhere near as scary or as original as The 6th Sense.  If you could not predict every jump and every ""twist"" then you're no doubt the audience they wrote this for as every trick in the thriller/horror book on ""making an audience jump"" is used. In conclusion, if you've not seen it already, save it for a rental it when there's a rainy Sunday morning you can watch it in bed, I think in that venue it will play the best.Otherwise, purchase 6th sense and watch that again (and again), even after the 4th viewing it was scarier than what lay beneath.",What Lies Beneath

For instance, when Norman wants to make love with his wife he says, ""Wanna fool around."" Wanna fool around?!! Groan.This movie has no rhythm to it. And the performances are quite lacking in any real emotion.Too often the movie relies on cheap thrills, such as bouts of silence before a loud phone ringing or people creeping up out of nowhere. There never is any real tension or suspense.A movie can't be scary or thrilling when the ""twist"" can be seen miles away. The trailer even practically gives the whole story away.

It was just so irrelevant in the end, crazy!!*** END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER ***And to make matters worse, this film had to rip several bits from Hitchcock films. The first part is so ""Rear Window"", and elements from ""Psycho"" are used to the extreme. Even the score sounds like it's from a Hitchcock film. I don't mind film-makers making homages and the like, but I get the feeling the film-makers wanted to be Hitchcock and not just celebrate his work. I'm surprised this movie wasn't called ""The woman who knew too much"". If you want a modern-day film of the likes Hitchcock might have done, check out David Fincher's wonderful ""Panic Room"".In the film's favor, I thought some scenes at the lake looked nice and there are some nice camera angles near the end of the movie, especially one that moves under the floor. Very cool!But there are just too many detractors to this movie to find any real enjoyment in it. So many scenes and elements are just too insane to take seriously.

I'm being a little on the generous side in giving this one a 5 out of 10.  How useful the IMDb has been as a guide: quite consistently, I haven't come to expect much from anything rated much above a 6.5, so I figure that I should have expected that this would be an ill-spent 2 hours.

The first hour or so was great, it scared me to death! However in the middle portion of the film it started to become weird, and you couldn't tell if either Harrison Ford or Michelle Pfeiffer was the baddie. This is found out at he end though. The plot involves Clare Spencer(Pfeiffer), a lady who when alone in her house, experiences strange goings-on. Doors open by themselves, baths fill themselves, the radio switches on by itself; and other such things. Her husband Norman (Ford), a doctor, thinks it's all in her head.

I'm not sure what TV trailer the US audiences saw, but if it was the same as the Australian one then the movie was spoiled to a certain degree (by way of explaination, one of the 'mysteries' of the movies was revealed in the trailer).I'm not sure if this was Robert Zemeckis' first crack at a thriller or not, but he doesn't do a bad job.  There are some truly nail-biting, hold-on-to-your-seat moments and a few twists (which given a little bit of nouse, aren't really twists at all but blatently obvious happenings).  I felt that the film was a fraction overlong and at times dragged unnecessarily.  The script was a little damp in the middle.Those familiar with Harrison Ford's work will be surprised at his turn in this film.All in all not a bad thriller - but could have been better with a little less film.",What Lies Beneath

234,notlehs,There were a lot of things I liked about this movie... BUT (possible spoilers but nothing major),6,2 August 2000,"Despite some plot holes, which are a part of this genre, Robert Zemeckis brings us an entertaining film.  He is obviously a BIG Hitchcock fan and it was kind of fun watching a new movie which walks in the same heavily traveled foot steps of the MASTER of SUSPENSE. Harrison Ford is great as well.  He looks like he had much more fun making this one than the last couple I have seen him in.  I can't wait for INDY 4.  My problems with the movie, however, were undeniable.(WARNING: This section could spoil some things for you.  So move on if you haven't seen the picture yet.)Characters were developed and left the story forever.  Why even bring them in, if we aren't going to use them?  The Daughter was a throw away, the long lost friend of Clare (Michelle Pfeiffer in an excellent performance) shows up half way through and then only for about 3 seconds later in the movie, and the neighbors which played a large part in the first half seem to disappear.  We don't even hear them through the windows anymore?  Can they not hear what's going on next door?  Aren't they in the least bit curious about the Psycho lady living next to them?  There are many others in the main plot as well.  I don't understand the need for the supernatural elements we are shown.  I think it would have played better if the supernatural elements were all in the imagination of the characters. ( OPEN YOUR EYES I AM FINISHED WITH SPECIFICS ) They could have done better things with the ending as well.  I was disappointed, but only a little. Some of the foreshawdowing is over-the-top, but that is part of the fun in a movie like this one.I really loved watching the audience get scared and jump on quite a few occasions.  They used a lot of the old style to make this happen.  That part was a lot of fun.Overall, I think it is a little better than average, but not perfect.  It was entertaining. 6 out of 10.

The movie Star two of the biggest movie stars from the nineties ( Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford) and directed by (Robert Zemeckis) you know the same person who directed (Back To The Future Trilogy), so you can see why i was so exited to see this film when it came out back then.This film is one of the best ( if not the best) scary movies ever that brought to the big screen, sorry don't get me wrong there are a lot more frightening films than this one, but that's not enough to make a successful one. what Lies Beneath have a great scary moments mixed with great acting, directing and story line that make it difficult for any other film to achieve.Michele Pfeiffer gave us a perfect example for a victim character, she starts the movie in a way and end it in another according to the story line and the events of the film, her performance here was so powerful after her great performance in The Deep End Of The Ocean 1999 ( now the biggest question is why she didn't had an Oscar nomination for both her roles!!!).As for Harrison Ford he brought a second evil character of his whole acting career which was somehow one of his best performance, he really convinced me with his villain character .",What Lies Beneath

238,jcdugger,"Was the ghost a new version of ""The Riddler""?!",4,21 July 2008,"I'm getting really tired of movies that portray a Ghost as a modern-day ""The Riddler"" from the Batman TV series! Like The Riddler, the Ghost in ""What Lies Beneath"" has all the answers that you're looking for -- but you're only going to get pieces to the puzzle one incoherent piece at a time.Let's all get on the same page here for a minute. We know, having watched the movie in full, that the ghost has these powers/abilities: 1) Can TYPE ON A COMPUTER KEYBOARD (or, at the very least, get words to appear on a computer screen)!! 2) Can write easy-to-read English on a fogged-up mirror, as if you were using your finger. 3) Can appear to numerous people (as the ghost appeared, in one way or another, to both the main stars in the movie). 4) Can open closed doors. 5) I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it seemed as if the ghost ""took over"" Claire's body and/or mind at one point (and mysteriously began acting sexually towards her murderer of all people, Mr. Ford).Why would a ghost, with the abilities outlined above, give you vague clues in pieces and not simply tell you what the hell is going on?! As a Ghost, if you can get words to appear on a computer screen, WHY IN THE HELL wouldn't you just write ""Your husband is a murderer, you can find my body at the end of your dock, my name is..."". Why would you simply type your initials hundreds of times over and over?! Again, are we dealing with The Riddler here?! If that wouldn't work, how about just writing to Claire on the mirror after every shower each day?? If you were a Ghost, and all you COULD DO is leave messy clues to somebody you hope will help solve your murder, would you, upon getting screamed at from the top of your helper's lungs ""What do you want?!?!"" -- really write back a simple ""You Know!""???? Obviously she didn't know yet, she was still gathering clues and thought she was going insane!! Wouldn't you have used that moment to write something just a bit more profound?! Like, maybe, ""I need your help!"". Wow.And at one point the Ghost ""took over"" Claire's body and/or mind -- don't even get me started on how she could have easily killed her murderer -- so shouldn't she have tried killing Harrison Ford's character, her murderer, instead of just getting him horny?! I could go on and on, but at this point, I'm fatigued over this plot-hole-filled tripe. I just want to emphasize -- I hate when Ghosts are portrayed as The Riddler's character in the Batman series - as simple clue-givers.:) JD",What Lies Beneath

Clark Gregg's screenplay is filled with twists, turns, false starts, side plots, and tons of intrigue.It's hard to describe What Lies Beneath without giving away huge spoilers, so it's best to go in cold. However, I can say that there ARE ghosts, they ARE angry, and you WILL probably pee yourself a few times.

This movie managed to cobble together some classic Hitchcock scenes and ideas, added with some old well-worn concepts, and call itself an original movie.

242,Egg_MacGuffin,Schizophrenic Hitchcock rip-off,6,13 August 2005,"Robert Zemeckis is a good director. It's too bad he blatantly resorted to copying Hitchcock rather than trying to be original. Ripping-off Hitchcock does not make your movie Hitchcockian.You all know the plot of the movie, so I'm not going to waste my time explaining it. But what I will comment on instead is the severe ""multiple personalities"" of this film. First, it's a ghost story. Then, it's a murder mystery. The problem lies in the fact that there's too much going on in each story that any attempt to connect them feels overtly contrived. It doesn't gel naturally, and it leaves too many loose ends that nobody mentions after they disappear (despite making a big deal about them earlier). The biggest example of this flaw is the neighbors. First, the female lead character thinks the man next door killed his wife, and finds a bloody shoe on their porch to support her claim. Later on (much later on), we find out that the couple living next to our main characters really have NOTHING to do with the actual plot. A whole hour of film wasted on something that doesn't even matter. And they never ask for the shoe back, either...and it's never revealed how it got bloody in the first place.I'm giving this movie a 6 out of 10 (which equals 3 out of 5 stars). The two lead characters were perfectly cast and anybody else playing their roles besides Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford would simply be wrong. Pfieffer because she is an outstanding actor (yes, actor. You don't call an author an authoress, do you?) and Ford because you will never expect him to play that kind of role...even while you're watching the movie. The cinematography is very good looking, if a little too bright. The sound design is especially noteworthy and helps a great deal in creating suspense. Alan Silvestri's 'Bernard Herrmann Psycho/Vertigo amalgam rip-off' score is too over-the-top for my liking and sometimes used when it silence would not only suffice, but enhance the viewing experience. And like I said before, Robert Zemeckis is a very talented director. He does a great job here, creating some very unique shots and generating suspense at key moments.But one thing that really sucked was the ending. Anyone who has at least seen one thriller before will see it coming from 3 miles away. Not the big twist, but everything that happens after it: the chemical that was explained earlier for no reason at all, the killer not really being dead, the killer not really being dead for a second time, the killer following the protagonist as she makes her escape, etc. It's 10 minutes worth of film and the audience is already at 11 minutes. Personally, I don't like being able to predict what will happen in a thriller, like I did when the dog came into the bathroom during the séance.This is a strange kind of film where there is a lot of bad, but even more good. Even the bad scenes are good, on their own. When they are all together in one film, it's still bad, however, outweighed by the good. Get it? Good.I'd just like to say again that not only is Michelle Pfeiffer one of the most beautiful women in the history of the world, but she is also a very talented actor. She definitely deserved some kind of award for her performance in this film. She carried the movie despite it's many flaws and made it worth watching, and she should do more movies now that I think about it.",What Lies Beneath

244,Mark0099,"Very good, and a little bad -- some (minor) SPOILERS here",8,28 August 2000,"Overall rating (1-10) = 8Scare factor (1-10) = 9+Number of characters you sometimes just want to slap >1First of all, comments seen here and elsewhere note that most of this movie's many scary moments are thoroughly preannounced, by swelling music and such.  This is correct.  Only a very few of the main fright points are done in ""Jaws"" style, i.e., sprung upon us when we can't  help but be off-guard.  Still, in my view, this doesn't detract much. This a VERY scary movie and a good investment if you like shock and surprise.  I definitely *wouldn't* advise seeing it while holding a hot coffee or a fragile dessert.That's not to say there's nothing in this film that detracts.  First, what talent Michelle Pfeiffer has is largely wasted during the first hour on a script that's way too full of boomer-angst cliches.  A big piece of the film's first half -- showing her character's daughter leaving for college and mom's resulting slushy reaction -- could  have been easily condensed or evaporated, trimming several minutes  from the total 129.  If this was there to demonstrate what a good  friend of mine likes to call EMS (Excessive Mom Syndrome) and to help confirm the idea that ole mom is even more delicate than she looks,  then I suppose it worked.  But so did several other shorter & simpler scenes, which sufficed.  (At one point I heard a Valley-Girl sort of voice in the row behind me mutter, after a heavy sigh: ""Okaaaaay, so she's wound a little too tight, we've *got* that already....""  It was an accurate point.  Somebody please wake me when this stock character type -- the artsy, wispy, idle, tormented, 40-ish upper-middle-class housewife with white teeth and a whiter Volvo -- breathes its last.Some comments have also noted considerable over- and under-acting by both Ford and Pfeiffer.  I agree.  The mix of super-calm moments and shocker scenes, while effective, is jarringly uneven.  I don't mean  to imply that a horror/thriller film should always jolt us only at  neat and regularly spaced intervals; but one could almost wonder if this film was divided into several parts at the beginning, each then being assigned to a separate director who rarely spoke with his or  her collaborators.  That said, I can't fault the *intensity* of any  of the several pee-in-your-pants moments.  As predictable and hollow as many of them are, each is a definite seat-grabber, and it would be hard to ""spoil"" any of them, even with a detailed verbal description.The often-noted similarities to ""Rear Window"" are obvious, even too obvious, but *not* essential to the plot and in retrospect may seem gratuitous. Again, while the film may keep your mind engrossed and your breathing shallow, the overkill factor is high.  Some of the  camera or editing work seems overdone in the same way -- sometimes almost playfully so, and to such an extent that I can't really say for sure if the performers are guiltier there than the director.For example, at one point about halfway through, a progressively more unnerved Claire [Pfeiffer] is inside her home peering intently at her neighbor's house, which we see in the predictable breathless pan from window to window, supposedly through her binoculars.  When she finally sights Thorwald -- ooooooooops, I mean her neighbor Warren Feur -- we of *course* see his scowling face in a lightning-zoomed close-up with a loud blast of eerie music.  and while this isn't done quite as badly as, say, the Large Marge eyeball-popper scene in ""Pee-wee Herman's Big Adventure,"" it's in the same class when it comes to timing & soundtrack!  It's quite a scary moment, but you might easily feel cheated by it soon afterward because (1) you realize that the zoom is a major part of what made the shot so scary, and (2) this Feur guy isn't really involved in the plot except to affirm, yet again, that Claire's a borderline basket case.Miscellany:  The film is set in Vermont, where I once lived, and I was pleased with some of the accuracies while also struck by some inaccuracies or improbabilities.  None are really worth mentioning, except for the repeated mentions of the town of Adamant.  Adamant is a real  place in Vermont, but it's referred to at least twice in the script as being ""down seven,"" meaning south on U.S. Highway 7 -- a main north-south thoroughfare, running the length of Vermont's western edge and traversing the Burlington/Lake Champlain area where the film's characters obviously live. But Adamant lies some 40 miles EAST of Route 7, a little over halfway across the state.  It can't realistically be described as ""down seven"" from anywhere else in in Vermont or even Quebec, and in fact does not lie astride *any* numbered highway.  (If the multiple mentions of this town's name  are a new kind of ""product placement"" technique, I'd be interested to know the rationale for so thoroughly mislocating it!)What happens *in* Adamant does have some bearing on the plot, but  the town itself is not significant, or at least not significant  enough to justify its quirky repetition.  (If I missed something about this while making a quick visit to the john, someone please  clue me in.)Special effects:  Not many, but those that we do see are quite good. No extraordinary innovations, just good scream-fuel.Bottom line:  It's scary and worth checking out.  It's lame in spots and the story isn't all that new, but these things won't likely make you sad you went.",What Lies Beneath
245,Henry-59,The audience laughed [spoiler],2,30 July 2000,"While I'm glad that the people who have raved about this movie enjoyed it, I thought it was one of the laziest and most predictable movies of the last few years--not counting Mel Gibson movies, of course.  Let's take the end of the movie--a series of cliches [the villain lunging out of nowhere, the desperate struggle in which our hero/ine always prevails] joined together with some of the silliest plot contrivances known to man.  The only saving grace about this movie was an audience that laughed at all of the absurd plot developments and cliched dialogue for the first hour or so.  But even they had become dispirited by the end--after two hours of this tripe we only wanted it to end, and couldn't care less who drowned and who survived.As for those people who think this was ""Hitchcockian,"" they must mean Family Plot or Torn Curtain. Hitchcock knew how to keep a story moving--Zemeckis does not.  And the thefts from Bernard Hermann were shameless.",What Lies Beneath
246,Kuntos_the_Destroyer,Go see Hitchcock's Psycho and The Sixth Sense.,4,15 July 2001,"It's common knowledge Robert Zemeckis shot this while Castaway star Tom Hanks prepared for the more 'meaty' part of his role in that film. So, it's kind of a time filler and it often shows. What Lies Beneath may have grossed a mint, but especially for someone like Zemeckis it is a relatively small film. No Vietnam wars or meetings with presidents, no time-traveling and no contact with aliens, just a haunted house. And I'm not talking a The Haunting-style castle here. Just a house. Of course, smaller doesn't necessarily mean less good (not that I'm a fan of Zemeckis' past works, though, because to me, he's still a Spielberg protege and not much of a distinctive director).What Lies Beneath is a halfway house between paranormal thriller and pure Hitchcock. The ghostly apparitions and the supernatural angle make up for the first element and the subplot with the neighbours and the way it's directed make up for the second. Also, the bathtub which plays a central role recalls Psycho, as does the basic structure of the script. For me, however, the movie falls short on both levels. On the Hitchcock level, mainly because the script is godawfully predictable (even without seeing what must be the most spoiler-ish trailer I've ever seen) and because no matter how hard I tried, there just didn't seem te be any deeper psychological meaning (or even logic) to it. Compared to Hitch's works, this is a high-gloss piece of emptiness. As a paranormal thriller it fails, because it really isn't about anything paranormal, it's just uses it as an audience-luring angle and a plot device. That makes What Lies Beneath feel like Strange Days. Yes, I know, they're very different films, but both films use interesting ideas (WLB: ghosts, Strange Days: recorded memories, cyberpunk) and reduce them to a plot device in a tired an old way. What Lies Beneath never delves into what ghosts are (ok, pretty obvious) or, more importantly, why they are. If you want to see a real ghost film, go rent The Sixth Sense. The second reason it doesn't work is it's use of shock tactics. I did jump twice, but in a movie with about fifteen jump moments, that's a lousy batting average. They are all build-up and no pay-off.Well, I shouldn't be all that negative, because What Lies Beneath is not all that uncomfortable viewing. The simple 'ghostly' scenes, like the one in which a door opens twice, miraculously, work very well. Also, the film's shot in a cold way, making for an often chilling film. Furthermore, the quality production values and the continuing promise of some form of surprise make it highly watchable. In fact the whole film feels like its jump moments. The build-up is good and will keep you interested but don't be surprised if the jump never follows. Of course I'm referring to the final act. Up until the point the proverbial penny drops it's solid entertainment. The problem is, you're waiting for a breathtaking, surprising or satisfying ending and you get nothing like that.Finally there's the acting, which boils down to the performances of it's two leads, Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer is the actual lead and pulls it off well enough. Most of the time, she is very convincing as the woman questioning her sanity as much as her surroundings. Harrison Ford, trying a supporting role this time (despite his being first billed), seems totally miscast.In short: Apparently for Zemeckis, smaller DOES mean less good. What Lies Beneath is not beyond redemption (it's still a LOT better than The Haunting), it still comes across as vacuous, predictable and generally unsatisfying. People stopped makes this kind of film a long time ago for a reason.Rating: 4/10",What Lies Beneath

Then, just as it should have started to take off, it fell apart.  It became corny, predictable, and worse still, boring.  A great deal of the first hour's viewing became irrelevant, and every cliche in this genre was trotted out to the accompaniment of loud music and bad acting.  Harrison Ford really struggled in this role, it didn't suit him - or perhaps he didn't suit it - and Michelle Pfeiffer seemed as confused by her character as the scriptwriters were.  Long before it ended, I was longing for it to be over and amused myself by counting how many times I predicted a 'shock' correctly.  Far too often I'm afraid.",What Lies Beneath

How dead must H Ford be before he finally stops reviving? How dumb would a genius be to leave his stirring victim with her toe massaging her salvation? How evil would he be to transform from a loving spouse into a ""reluctant"" wife killer  without so much as a hint of ambivalence (in the film he smirks and relishes his 2nd murder, clearly unable to take his role seriously).Only Ms Pfeiffer deserves praise in this overlong nightmare of incompetence and irresponsible editing.

I didn't completely see the end coming.  I thought the imagery of water, used throughout, was very effective.  The film was beautifully photographed.  There were a few things that didn't work for me, though.  These usually were due to a certain lack of attention to details.  For example, why in one scene did Michelle Pfeiffer's character try to look through the fence to find out if her neighbors were home when she had such a great view from her bedroom window (and some binoculars)?  I also didn't know why the person who was missing was originally called a girl when she was actually 24 years old. I also wondered how many computers were in their home and where they were located.

""What Lies Beneath"", despite what the critics may have said, is a scary film. Director Robert Zemeckis isn't afraid to let tension build for close to an hour before giving us the first genuine jump-out-of-your-seat moment and, when it's as good a jump as this one is, it's worth the wait. In fact there are several ""jump scares"" in the film and they really are frightening. ""What Lies Beneath"" nearly had me hitting the ceiling with some of the scares it provides. That means Zemeckis did something right.Robert Zemeckis always wanted to make a Hitchcockian thriller, and for the most part ""What Lies Beneath"" is just that. Zemeckis even makes sure to throw some Hitchcock references (Psycho, Rear Window) into the film as an homage to his inspiration. There are some excellent shots in this film that would make Hitchcock proud. The use of glass floors, for example, to let us get up close and personal with dropped objects or fallen characters is used effectively and just enough so that we don't get too much of a good thing. Zemeckis' choice of houses is also extremely Hitchcockian. It's a beautiful lakeside estate during the day, but at night it's like a monster looming in the distance: shadowy and imposing.The only un-Hitchcockian aspect of the film is Zemeckis' use of CGI to obtain some shots. Not that I'm saying they're bad shots, they certainly are not that, but Hitchcock would find a way to do them without digital trickery were he alive today. Then again, Hitchcock was an unparalleled genius when it came to trick shots like moving a camera through a solid wall or floor. Zemeckis pulls off these kinds of shots in his own way, and they're still great.A Zemeckis trademark is his ability to get great performances out of his cast, and ""What Lies Beneath"" is no exception. Michelle Pfeiffer is allowed to go completely bonkers in what should have been an Oscar nominated performance. Pfeiffer makes herself seem truly frightened, and she portrays Claire's mental breakdown very well. Harrison Ford is kept subdued and nearly monotone throughout most of the film, providing great surprises later on when his true emotions burst to the surface. I could imagine an Oscar nod for him too. Man, where was the Academy that year? The two personalities, one unbridled and afraid, the other disbelieving and confused, play off one another perfectly to create an aspect of marital discord that adds wonderfully to the film's complexity.With plenty of twists and turns (which I dare not reveal) to keep you guessing to the end, great acting, virtuoso camera work, and some truly frightening moments, ""What Lies Beneath"" is a thriller that ranks with some of the best of them. This is another film that Robert Zemeckis can be proud of.",What Lies Beneath

The master would be proud. This is a lesson in building tension. Use of camera, locations, music and plotting are brilliant.That doesn't mean it hasn't got any flaws.... Sure there are some convenient plotdevises (the serum, the key) and the story doesn't bare much scrutany. But watch PSYCHO, REAR WINDOW or STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Hitch did the same thing. And the most important thing: Hitchcock said: ""the audience wants to be manipulated"" . Zemeckis knows that and made one of the scariest thrillers in years.Many critics hated the ending (too much, too easy) but I just loved it.The film moves VERY slowly but it is done so effectively that the shocks resonated much louder.See it, but don't read any plotreferences and stay clear of the foolish trailer.

This one has you on the tip of your seat from moment one and never lets you go. The music, the cinematography, the editing, the acting, little things tossed here and there in the film to make you... wonder, are all combined in the most excellent way!

There is nothing knew in it.  Pfifer plays a sexy vapped air head that might of had more head troma then the film lets on.  Ford is O. K. in a little different role for him.  The Ghost is more sympathetic then scary and would be a big help if you had your hands full of groceries while trying to get to your house.  Most of the scares come from loud noises and flashes of lighting.The mystery might hold most people in their seats, if they haven't all ready figured it out from watching the previews.It's not a bad movies.

The first half moved along nicely, filled with traditional scary movie tricks and euphemisms, but which are all still scary none the less. Some might say that the horror movie is a very specific science. When you go outside the borders of its realm, the movie might fall apart. That is what happened in What Lies Beneath. It lost its momentum. Suddenly the story shifted, and nothing of the first part remained at all. It was as if the first forty-five minutes to an hour were a different film. While Michelle Pfeiffer was superb, her eerie blue eyes and ethereal paleness were not enough to frighten. Harrison Ford failed at his role as the disbelieving husband. All I can say truly positive is at least it didn't follow the now very-told story of the woman who didn't know she was dead. The car accident was ever just a car accident.",What Lies Beneath
260,Predator-11,"Boring, predictable and not the least bit scary.",2,25 July 2000,"Walking into the theater I wasn't really sure what to expect from this movie, the previews made it out to be a horror/suspence/thriller/mystery which I definatly like. I wasn't all that impressed with the previews but I figured anything with Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer couldn't possibly be that bad. Boy was I wrong!From the very beginning I started realizing how poorly made this film was starting with the bland dialog. I've seen great talent get wasted on poor scripts or direction many times before but this was just rediculous. Harrison Ford is one of my favorite actors of all time, he can really get into a charactor and make you truely love, or hate him and that's what makes him brilliant, but in this film he falls short of even a good performance. But who can blame him, he had nothing to work with.Next comes the ""horror"" scenes. Talk about predictable. There was absolutely nothing in this movie that hasn't already been done a dozen times before. All the parts that are supposed to be startling are just the same old, ""look one direction then look back and theres something standing there"", camera angle trick repeated over and over. Both me and my friend who have seen a lot of horror movies could sit there and count down to when the startling part was going to happen.The plot is also incredibly predictable. Partially due to all the spoilers included with the trailer. Both of us had the whole thing figured out half an hour into the film. I never walk out of movies because sometimes they'll get better towards the end but this one goes from bad to worse with plot ""twists"" you saw coming a mile away.Undoubtably the worst film I've ever seen Harrison Ford in and it's just one step above Battlefield Earth as the second worst film I've seen this year.

262,char treuse,The Big Cheesy,1,18 May 2006,"This is an example of a cheesy, low-budget idea gone Big-Budget, High-Concept Hollywood. The sole screenplay to date by actor Clark Gregg is an uneasy mix of supernatural thriller, suspense film and psycho-killer-horror with a clumsy exposition. The secondary characters are throw-aways, as the story suffocatingly focuses on a professor and his wife. Harrison Ford plays his role with all the passion of a cigar-store Indian, while Michelle (""Don't hate me because I'm beautiful"") Pfeiffer does her boilerplate pained-and-tormented turn, complete with pinched cheeks and crocodile tears. Robert Zemeckis' direction is banal at best. The over-the-top CGI work is largely superfluous and overblown, particularly during the climactic scenes. Some reviewers described this as ""Hitchcock-like"" but Hitchcock would never have touched such a sub-par script nor depended so heavily on f/x. In fact, ""What Lies Beneath"" is rather short on suspense. There are, admittedly, a couple of scares but, shamelessly over 2 hours long, this ""thriller"" is largely inflated and anemic, and more closely resembles bottom-of-the-barrel DePalma.",What Lies Beneath

The simple answer is because it's so good! I love to see actors and actresses play varied characters, and act in different types of films. Ford Harrison did a great job in this. At first when I watched it, some parts were confusing, but after I watched it again, I understood everything completely. I love the storyline in the movie, and it keeps your attention all the way through. Some people are saying it's annoying how in lots of movies, a character seems nice, but then turns out to be the ""evil"" one. Well, you can't really say that for ""What Lies Beneath"" because even though that happened with the husband who seemed so perfect, this movie had the idea way before most of the ones that followed, like, for example take ""Hide and Seek."" The dad was so nice, and then turned bad at the end. oh well. There's not much more can say about this movie.

There are actually people who laughed when Michelle Pfeiffer discovered that it was only 'the dog', me being one of them. The movie gets talky and less interesting during the middle (but at least it gives us some time to check out Pfeiffer's cheekbones) ,nevertheless the ending was absolutely amazing, and I find the 'battle in the bathtub' was really well-acted (DON'T laugh!) and shot in a creative way that puts you...there. Personally, I think the scariest moment was when Ford flips back Pfeiffer's head, only to find his wife became the dead girl and her face was all green and swollen , although it was-obviously-only his imaginations, I still find it horrific as hell. Other 'good' moments include Pfeiffer getting sexy and takes away the apple, plus the whole I-suspect-my-neighbor-killed-his-wife thing at the beginning. Of course, things doesn't turn out to be what you expected otherwise the movie would end too soon. Good casting choice means Pfeiffer...Harrison Ford? What are you doing here?",What Lies Beneath
269,Dolf,Too predictable (contains spoilers),6,11 June 2001,"*** CONTAINS SPOILERS *** You will be warned of the spoiler before reading the paragraph...What Lies Beneath wasn't necessarily a bad film - unfortunately it was too predictable and formulaic to be a good film.Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer both did a fairly good acting job in this film, but this film felt flat in spite of their efforts.  The story isn't a bad one, but it is just way too tired a storyline to excite the viewer.  The film's special effects are actually very good, but again, they can't save this film from mediocrity.The predictability doesn't just refer to the story or film as a whole, it is evident in individual scenes where the viewer has no doubt of what will happen.  If you're still planning to see the film stop reading now... spoilers ahead...****Spoilers from here to end*****As I was saying the predictability is rampant.  Here are a few specific examples:Very early in the movie they make way too big a deal about the cell phone not working until they get halfway across the bridge.  It's so obvious that Michelle Pfeiffer will need to use that phone and will have to race across the bridge to do so that it isn't even funny.It was obvious that Harrison Ford killed the girl and covered it up right from the beginning, and it makes the viewer mad that Michelle Pfeiffer takes soooo long to catch on.The predictability actually goes down to the way individual shots are lined up - for example, the scene where Ford comes home and calls for his wife (who is possessed at the time) and then opens the refrigerator door.  Was there anyone who was startled that Pfeiffer is standing behind the door when it closes?  Even Harrison Ford doesn't do a good job of acting  surprised in that scene...Well, like I said - not a bad film, just too predictable.  I'll leave on a positive note:  My favorite shot/special effect - the outline of the face in the snow in the graveyard when the camera pulls back in the final shot. Very cool.",What Lies Beneath

But the story, the scares, everything seems to fall apart midway through.A-list celebrity Michelle Pfeiffer (one of my favorite actresses, I might add) plays Claire Spencer, a house wife married to Norman Spencer (the legendary Harrison Ford). Their daughter has just gone away to college, and with Norman gone at work all day long, Claire is pretty much left all alone at her home until night. Claire is a little depressed, but keeps herself busy gardening. One day, however, she encounters a wildly sobbing neighbor. She's hysterical, and Claire, being her nosy, middle-aged self, attempts to comfort her and asks what's wrong. She ignores her, of course, crying hysterically in her own little world. Claire, worried, tells her husband Norman later that night, but he tells her to mind her own business. Claire ignores him, and she and her friends spy on their neighbors house throughout the day. When they see the husband carrying an implied life bag with her body in in, putting it the back seat of his car, she is convinces that her husband murdered his wife.But the story doesn't end there. Her lights sometimes randomly go out. The door swings open every now and then. And then a frightening message appears on the mirror. Claire is convinced that her house is haunted by the spirit of her murdered neighbor. What will she do? How will she put the spirit to rest? The first hour of the movie is extremely scary, suspenseful, and has a genuinely creep atmosphere. But then there comes a twist about midway through. A bad twist, and the whole hour of the movie goes to waste, and doesn't seem to relate at all to the movie's original plot. The first hour just seemed like a scapegoat. I'm not going to give it away, but it was a disappointing turn in the movie.The movie runs 130 minutes long, where it could have been cut down to a mere 100 minutes. The twist is where it started going downhill. There are still a few more scares throughout and a few more ""Oh get out of there! Wait! Don't do that! Get your butt out of there!!"" moments, but the first hour easily swallows the second hour and eats it for supper. After the twist, the movie seems to drag on. Suddenly, we don't seem to care about the story, what happens next, and it becomes somewhat boring.The first half of the movie is thrilling, while the second half has it's moments, but the movie as a whole fails to live up to expectations thanks to the ending.However, the movie has gotten some great reviews so maybe it's ll down to taste. The acting is top notch (what else would you expect from Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford?) and it's overall a good, ghost story to watch on a Saturday night.

The active subwoofer groaned and moaned, the sounds of doors opening and closing, water running in bathtubs and voices whispering when there was no-one there, reached me from all possible directions.

276,doug_burton,"Well-crafted, suspenseful movie with fine acting",8,3 August 2000,"This movie was a well-crafted thriller in the Hitchcock style; I really wish I had not seen any of the trailers prior to viewing this movie, because some of the suspense that would normally have built up during the first hour was spoiled by knowledge gained from the trailer.  To be fair, the trailer doesn't spoil everything (thank goodness), but it spoils enough to make the first hour seem a little slow in the build-up.Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific in her role of the housewife and mother now facing an empty nest, as her daughter heads off to college.  Robert Zemeckis does a fine job of building suspense and keeping the audience just a little off-balance (in spite of the spoilers in the trailers); in combination with Pfeiffer's acting, one is never quite sure whether Claire Spencer is deranged, possessed, or calculating.  While Harrison Ford does his usual fine job of acting, as the obsessive, genius husband living in the shadow of his super-genius father, it is Pfeiffer who, of the two, has the most screen time and who therefore carries the film.My only other complaint (besides the spoilers in the trailers) has to do with a minor bit of casting. While I think Wendy Crewson is a fine actress, I have to question casting her as the wife of one of Dr. Spencer's colleagues, given that she so recently appeared as Harrison Ford's wife in Air Force One... seeing Ford and Crewson together on screen again was a distraction that brought me out of the film, at a point when I should have been getting more absorbed into the film.  But it is a minor point.Overall, the movie kept me in suspense virtually throughout it's entirety, and the final 30 minutes were gripping.  At several points toward the end, I thought for sure I knew what was going to happen, only to be surprised by a sudden twist or unexpected turn.  And, the film does have its humorous moments as well; Diane Scarwid helps to lighten things up as Claire's somewhat ditzy friend Jody, and Zemeckis has some fun with some of the backdrops in the quaint New England towns (a Vermont town named Adamant? And the name of the curio shop is ""The Sleeping Dog"", as in ""Let sleeping dogs lie."")Rating: 8 out of 10",What Lies Beneath

On one hand, it has some of the most brilliant camera tricks in recent memory, and has several great twists.  On the other hand, Harrison Ford's character is not very believable, and it is way too long.  Let's start with the good.  What Lies Beneath uses state of the art cinematography in conjunction with CGI.  This results in some strikingly eerie, and sometimes beautiful, scenes.  The story is good, but takes way too long to get started.  That is the biggest problem with the movie, time.  What Lies Beneath runs at near 2 and 1/2 hours, when it could easily be cut to 2 hours.  There are great scares, but there are too many. However this does make the entire movie suspenseful, which was probably the intention.  Still, there is a side story about a man murdering his wife which has almost nothing to do with the main story, and this goes on for a whole 1/2 hour.  There is an amazing twist with Harrison Ford's character, but for some reason I just didn't buy it.

But there ARE some scary moments in this film, and the Ford-Pfeiffer chemistry works well.Harrison Ford (despite his bad haircut) did an admirable job - although it's difficult to imagine why he would have an affair with a grad student when he is married to the lovely Michelle Pfeiffer.  What was he thinking? Michele also has a good-sized dog that seems to disappear when she needs the companionship the most.  Hell, I wouldn't go where she goes without a dog at my side.Expect to be scared, expect to be drawn into the story - but don't expect a classic scare film.

284,kejava,A good old-fashioned summertime suspense thriller.,7,30 July 2000,"Riding on the coat tails of such recent thrillers as ""The Sixth Sense,"" ""What Lies Beneath is a good old-fashioned thriller with a supernatural twist.  Claire Spencer's (Michelle Pfeiffer) life begins to fall apart when her daughter goes to college.  She sees the ghost of a young woman in her house, and odd things begin to happen around her.  Doors open and shut, computers and stereos switch on and off, and mysterious neighbors come and go.  Her husband Norman (Harrison Ford) doesn't believe what she is seeing is really happening.  As we find out more about who this young woman was, and why she is appearing in Claire and Norman's house, the pranks become less amusing and the tension mounts. Director Robert Zemeckis builds the suspense masterfully, creating an increasingly tense mood, punctuated frequently by ""Boo!"" surprises.  As formulaic and predictable as these tension-release episodes are, they work.  Though the ending is predictable, it's still a good ride.  And it's a pleasure to see Harrison Ford in a role different from his usual summertime typecasting.",What Lies Beneath

290,Sandcat2004,Ebert and Roeper are sorely misguided with their dislike for this film...,9,7 August 2004,"It is interesting to revisit the archived reviews available at EbertandRoeper.tv and listen to their comments regarding this film and their perception of its ability to frighten, its technical construction, and its characters' success in aiding the narrative. Each of the respective critics dislike What Lies Beneath in both its construction (camerawork and plot development) and its effectiveness in creating suspense.  While this movie is enjoyable regardless of whether it was viewed on opening weekend or whether it is the third or fourth viewing on television, it is more understandable that Ebert and Roeper had some issues with the film during its theatrical release (whether they have altered their views upon its DVD release, I do not know).  The true beauty of this film is the manner in which it holds up over time and how it DOES splice all of the great filmmaking techniques together into a nice homage to classic suspense films.The plot, including the incremental revelations of paranormal activities within the newly gone-off-to-college childless home of Pfeiffer and Ford, is not really what drives this movie.  Ebert and Roeper complained in their critiques that there are too many red herrings that serve no purpose but to mislead the audience; thus, when they are exposed as mere ruses, much of their existence within the film is superfluous.  But that is the fun of the movie.  That is the fun of many classic suspense films, even numerous Hitchcock films.  There are situations that are added because they lend a hand in the build-up fear, not the characters' fears, but the viewers' fears.  In Psycho, the image of the cop's face outside Leigh's car window, masked by sunglasses, expressionless, and looming over the camera is scary to viewers.  Yes it fits into the script because she is frightened as a result of her thievery.  But ultimately, it is the viewers' own fear of cops' intimidation tactics that makes the scene effective.  In What Lies Beneath, hearing cries of distress through a fence that offers no real visibility of the cause of such pangs is very similar.  Who cares if it is mainly a device to build uneasiness?To be fair, Ebert and Roeper really seemed more irritated that too much of the plot and its elements of mystery were revealed in the marketing of the film .  The true cause of the haunting that Pfeiffer's characters is terrorized by was apparently revealed rather blatantly in the trailers and television spots used to promote the film. Therefore, Ebert and Roeper seemed more angry that they were not even given the chance to enjoy the unfolding of the plot and the subsequent suspense.  However, it is only know that their argument seems to be more fallacious in its use of logic.  I understand that each person has a reaction to a film based on the uniqueness of their own likes, dislikes, and inclinations to genre, but there is an established set of framing techniques, camera movements, and lighting designs that reliably cause an emotional reaction by the viewers.  It is very hard to find Ebert and Roeper's critiques impervious to default when this film does not tend to lose much of its emotional effects upon repeat viewings.To elaborate, the unknown ghost, its motivation, and its history and relevance to Claire (Pfieffer) are plot points for the basic construction of a three act narrative; and, a three act narrative is a contrivance proved to be effective for the assimilation of information by means of tapping into the inherent way humans use logic to invent concepts from raw data (if a, then b, and if b, then c: therefore if a, then c). Subsequently, the artist now has a template on which to attach the expressions of humanity that create the emotional impact of the film (or play, etc.).  In a sense, the structure of What Lies Beneath is very simple and only attempts to create a large enough template to succeed in allowing the viewer to follow the basic arc of the narrative.  The strength of the film exists in the the technical construction and how precisely orchestrated it is to get the most emotional impact from the various moments in the film.  Watching the film for the third or fourth time, the plot isn't new or exciting, the characters aren't complex, yet the film is still suspenseful.  It is not the unfolding of the story creating all the suspense; rather, it is Zemeckis's camera use, his choices for sound and light design, and his ability to precisely coordinate a myriad of elements that enables the film to work as a whole.  This is not a film that would survive on its script.  This is not a film that would survive by its stars alone.  This film succeeds because of the choices in direction.Finally, to counter Ebert and Roeper's unsound critiques of this film, attention should be paid to their mention of films that they found parallel to What Lies Beneath, whether thematic or visually reminiscent in some way.  Roeper states that the movie has too many cliches and that the ending is reminiscent of Carrie, Cape Fear, and even Gone with the Wind.  On the other side of the aisle, Ebert compares the film to Ghostbusters because of moments he found comedic that were not intended to be so (although I don't find any scene unintentionally comedic).  The odd aspect of their critiques is the absence of any mention of the numerous shots Zemeckis directly lifted from several of Welles' films and a litany of shot selections that pay homage to Hitchcock. While this movie isn't groundbreaking, it is a great exercise in technique that results in a fun, effective film.",What Lies Beneath
291,bornyesterdayandtomorrow,The Neighbor,5,13 February 2006,"The main flaw about this movie is that the first hour revolves around the neighbor--who's said to be some sort of psychopathic serial killer. The rest of it revolves around Harrison being the bad guy. Not to say that he isn't good at it. He is! Really! He and Michelle are both great actors and they give off great performances--why I'm not giving the movie a one. But the movie just doesn't make much sense as far as the neighbor goes. I think that he could've had at least a little more screen time--perhaps the one who saves Pfieffer from Ford? I was expecting this, but nope! That's why I give it a five. I love Harrison--just not this time.",What Lies Beneath
292,Ivan-28,The movie that hopes you're stupid,3,26 July 2000,"Although the first hour and a half is filled with cliche after cliche, it still has a good spooky moment or two. But the half hour counts on you being a stupid person in order to enjoy the movie.(WARNING: SPOILERS!) For instance, a smart person would not walk next to her husband's hand, or reach over him to tug weakly at the phone in his pocket. Also, someone as hurt as Harrison Ford's character could not have been able to climb onto the boat while Michelle Pfeiffer's character drives away in the truck carrying it. Or when she's spying on the neighbor with binoculars, she never points them in a direction that makes sense. Instead they're pointed where the next-door neighbor couldn't be just to instill phony suspense. The only way you would buy these premises is if you're stupid or if you've never seen a suspense/horror movie before.Then there's the many times, Robert Zemeckis directs a tense scene slowwwwwwly until you get either (a.) a face of a ghost to startle you, (b.) a friend or family member to bump into someone to startle you, or (c.) the family dog to startle you. The first couple of times, it may work. But it got really old after the 6th or 7th time.I read somewhere that Harrison Ford commented on his dislike for Hitchcock's films (which are the obvious inspiration for WHAT LIES BENEATH) because the people in them are unrealistic and stiff. He has some nerve after making this film.",What Lies Beneath

Then it kept dragging on and introducing new plot lines and twists and turns until toward the end I was just waiting for the finish (which was a pretty good special effect, if nothing else). I would say it was a better than average Hollywood movie, but a worse than average thriller.",What Lies Beneath
294,TrickyTheHorrorFreak,"Blatant homage to Hitchcock, but a fine film in its own right!",9,19 November 2006,"""What Lies Beneath"" will always be remembered as Robert Zemeckis' homage to Alfred Hitchcock. From the opening credits to the stunning climax, the techniques of the master are unashamedly paid tribute to. The music, the camera-work, the building up of suspense, the characters names etc. are all straight from numerous classic Hitchcock films such as ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"" and ""Psycho"". But while it may seem quite stupid to try to copy such a brilliant director's work (the ""Psycho"" remake comes to mind), Zemeckis has surprisingly created a great film here.Clair and Norman appear to be a happily married couple. They clearly have money, a beautiful house and a daughter heading towards her own successful career. But when Claire suspects her neighbor of murdering his wife, her world suddenly begins to crumble around her. Not only is she constantly spying on the suspicious activities next door, but she also becomes aware of a presence within her own house. While those around her (Norman included) believe her to be losing her sanity, Claire searches deeper for answers which inevitably leads her to repressed memories that, with the help of beautiful girl long dead, lead her to a shocking revelation that sends her marriage and mental state into turmoil.When reading the above plot, you may feel that this is nothing new. There have been countless movies over the years with ghosts attempting to communicate with the living to reveal the cause of their demise. In fact, there are plenty of cliché moments in ""What Lies Beneath"". But the film is so beautifully and lovingly made that it is thoroughly entertaining nonetheless. Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford are both fantastic and completely convincing throughout. Pfeiffer in particular has a tough role to get through here, having to be both extremely vulnerable and steamily sexual at various times. She is always beautiful, but at the age of 42, she is simply stunning and captivating as Clair. But it's Zemeckis' direction that stands out as exceptional. The film is quite long at 2 hours, but this running time is used to build up the intensity. What starts out as reasonably cheap scares, turn into genuinely frightening ones by the second hour. There are some great set pieces (the bath scene in particular is a classic) and CGI is seamlessly utilized throughout, particularly as a tool for camera trickery.I know this film has its detractors and I can honestly understand the qualms that they raise. But a good film is a good film in my book, regardless of its origin or blatant worshiping status. ""What Lies Beneath"" gave me exactly what I wanted with some great scares, masses of suspense and intrigue, topped off with fantastic visuals, sound, acting and direction. What more could I possibly ask for in a thriller!?",What Lies Beneath

Watch Michelle Pfeiffer playing a nervous, wealthy housewife, with a singular facial expression, and a ego-maniacal husband, as she putters around her big, empty house... watch the front door open by itself over and over again... watch a picture fall down and shatter over and over again... watch the bathtub being full of water over and over again... watch the story unfold exactly the way you guessed it would, one dull, predictable scene after another... So, so, so thrilling.I kept watching because I really hoped the story would get better... *sigh* No dice. I will say, however, that I did enjoy the photography towards the end of the film (seriously, what took so long?!)

296,EddieK,"Plausibility aside, homage to Hitchcock succeeds stylistically",7,7 November 2005,"Robert Zemeckis joins the club of directors who have paid homage to Hitchcock with this stylistic and suspenseful entry in the haunted house genre. ""What Lies Beneath"" finds a geneticist (Ford) and his wife (Pfeiffer) alone together in their spacious Vermont home after their daughter leaves to attend college. While Ford goes off to attend scientific conferences, Pfeiffer stays home - where things get spookier by the day.References to Hitchcock's films abound, from a plot setup that echoes ""Rear Window"" to textual and thematic nods to ""Rebecca,"" ""Suspicion,"" and ""Psycho."" There's even a wink to 1926's ""The Lodger"" (Hitchcock's earliest success) as Zemeckis shoots key moments from beneath a glass floor.Ford is no stranger to Hitchcock-influenced films, having starred in Roman Polanski's skillful ""Frantic"" (1988). But it's Pfeiffer who carries the movie, delivering the gamut of requisite emotions and keeping the film completely watchable even as the plot machinery begins to creak in the film's second act. Red herrings, blind alleys, and pat explanations pile up, threatening to undermine the suspense so effectively generated in the movie's first hour. But Zemeckis rescues the film with an astonishing finale, as exciting as it is implausible. My advice?

Harrison Ford gave a great performance as Dr. Norman Spencer, but shallow writing hindered this performance, and this character is quite different from the swashbuckling and romantic characters audiences are used to seeing.  Once he turned out to be the killer I was shocked.  Don't get me wrong Ford portrayed this role to perfection.  Pfeiffer had done excellent job playing Fords wife.

303,generichorrorfreak,the mystery unravels..,7,16 October 2010,"What Lies Beneath is a great thriller. Tons of suspense. Lead character Claire starts to feel as though her and her husband's house is being haunted as a number of odd things start to happen: doors opening by themselves, the water running in the tub when no one had turned it on, a picture frame falling, etc. Additionally she keeps finding clues that unravel the mystery of the ghost she believes is there. As the movie goes on more is revealed about past events that further provoke her belief in the haunting being real and her desire to figure it out.The first half of the movie is rather uneventful but lays the groundwork for the great mystery. The second half picks up pace and creates tons of suspense to an ultimately action-packed and hair-raising ending. Everything Claire discovers leads her closer towards the truth and you can't wait to see how it plays out. Most of this movie, including much of the ending, goes in a calmness-begets-suspense kind of way, and it works. Claire spends most of her time hanging around her house. The most action (except towards the end) is her going to a dinner party with her husband and some friends, and some cocktail party thrown by the school at which her husband works.

305,dforster,Psychological Discovery vs. Ghostly Visitations,8,10 August 2000,"I found this film a cut above the typical supernatural thriller because it allows one to interpret what is happening by resorting only to the wonder and power of the human mind without having to believe in the supernatural. Unlike some others, e.g., `The Exorcist' where the movie (not the book) has weakened the power of the story by forcing us to accept only the supernatural explanation.  Roman Polanski's great film, `Repulsion' is certainly an example of how powerful and frightening the human mind can be. Although having said this, `What Lies Beneath' may have been weakened by the quality of the special effects, that is, by being so good visually, it became more difficult to separate the ghost from the mind.  Right from the opening, one can interpret the film as watching someone in the process of discovering their inner conflicts (based on what they know but are afraid to face) and that they now must resolve.  As you see this film keep in mind that all of the supernatural manifestations are never seen by more than one person at a time and in this way you can sense and be afraid of how the unconscious can create the most frightening illusions.  I especially enjoyed the scenes with the psychiatrist and how cleverly the doctor used the patient's belief in a ghost to help his patient find resolution (of course because I do not want to give anything away, one could argue that the resolution was more dangerous than the doctor probably anticipated).  I think most of you will also see that the meaning of `lies' in the title has many meanings (I count 4 at least) each of which is well presented in this film.  As many of us have discovered, what is left to imagination can be more frightening than what we see on the screen.",What Lies Beneath

You've got to give credit to a fabulous director in Robert Zemekis (Forrest Gump).  It's not scary in a 'Blair Witch' sense but it is in a 'Psycho' sense.  Using classic Hitchcock elements, such as close ups on the taps in the bath, Zemekis develops a good thriller/horror without it being 'Scream'. The first half of the film is a bit slow moving but the plot soon opens up.  Harrison Ford, who is, I might add, looking a bit old! (I'm sorry Mr. Ford) with Michelle Pfeiffer will always be a winning combination.  The twist in the plot, I personally thought, was brilliant.  However there are signs in this film which we've either seen before or would expect, such as Ford playing a v. clever doctor.  Pfeiffer is a brilliant heroine and proves wrong the theory that as actresses get older they get worse.  7/10 - worth watching, but don't rush, as watching at home on video will be sufficient.",What Lies Beneath

While she keeps searching for more evidence, she starts finding things she may regret forever. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the part brilliantly, slowly uncovering secrets she never would have dreamt to find out. Harrison Ford was made for this role, with a perfect twist you'd never see coming.

The plot is simple: Michelle Pfeiffer is a constantly worried woman, and her husband is a super-perfect handsome scientist played by Harrison Ford. Pfeiffer's performance is good, but her character is simply too weepy; she's almost a modernized caricature of Joan Fontaine in REBECCA, and the trouble with that is that most women simply don't behave like that anymore. The bulk of the movie consists of a string of scare, or ""jump"", scenes, followed by Pfeiffer's increasingly hysterical reactions, and then a brief moment where Ford consoles and tucks her into bed. The jump scenes come literally every few minutes, to the point that far from keeping us on edge, they become irritating. You know when it's coming, and you come to dread not the creepiness of it, but the irritation of it, because it's so loud and hokey and obnoxious. There are way, way, way, way too many jump scenes in this film; you could practically set your clock to them. After about an hour of this irritating and repetitive (and lazy) attempt at building a suspenseful atmosphere (which of course fails), it becomes clear that a dead lady is trying to communicate with Pfeiffer. She figures out that the spirit is trying to tell her the identity of her murderer. Gasp! How original! And does hubby believe her? Well what do you think? Of course he's all ""Oh honey you're just hysterical"" and ""I think you're overreacting"" and so on. And who's the killer? Could it be the seemingly normal but vaguely sinister next door neighbor... or could that be a red herring? Hmm... And then we find out who the killer really is in case we hadn't already guessed. Well, I've spoiled enough, but let me tell you, the revelation of the killer's identity is no more surprising than it is plausible. And toward the end of the movie, when our heroine finally faces off with the killer, director Robert Zemeckis must have suddenly developed a James Cameron complex; the climactic suspense sequences at the end of the story are as laughable as any lousy action film, and it is a fitting end to this completely mindless, unoriginal, and oddly self-impressed bit of tripe. Zemeckis throws every trick in the book at us, but after a while it just seems kind of desperate. While this may not be the worst film ever, it just doesn't gel for me. I found it predictable, contrived, and lazy. I didn't feel this was as bad as a 1, but I couldn't bring myself to give it anything above 2.",What Lies Beneath
315,d_in_chi,The scariest thing about this movie is that it required 130 minutes and $100mil,2,6 April 2014,"I had been putting off watching this movie for years... 2+ hours, 2 A- list actors and 1 big budget are the perfect recipe for disappointing horror and/or thrillers.I eventually got around to it, but couldn't get around to finishing it. Admittedly, I skipped through much of the second hour after one hour without scares, thrills, suspense, or even much in the way of mood. The characters and the actors playing them all seem tired. For the first 30 minutes we're treated to lots of day-to-day conversation and people just hanging out. Harrison Ford is particularly disappointing, a shell of himself, and seems as bored with the story as I was. Michelle Pfeiffer tries to breathe life into this disaster, but cookie cutter ""Eek! A ghost!"" performances can be had for many millions less. Outside of the stars there is no talent and very little dialogue beyond small talk. As for the ghost... someone wearing a white bed sheet with eye-holes would have been more frightening.Any horror script that contains a scene, 40 minutes in, beginning with a Ouija board and ending with a fake-out scare (Oh, it's just the dog!) is not worthy of 40 minutes of my time, let alone 130. And of course, such a script will also contain the ""You're Crazy!""/""Am I crazy?""/""I swear I'm not crazy!"" sequence, complete with psychiatrist, shocked onlookers, angry spouse, etc., and last but not least, the canned, mainstream ghost story movie ending... a switcheroo here, some vengeance there, a surprise bad guy, blah blah blah.",What Lies Beneath
316,Tom-116,"Not as complex as Sixth Sense, But more entertaining",8,14 July 2000,"Robert Zemekis is famous for breaking ground with his films, Back to the Future, Forest Gump, and Contact to name a few.  What Lies Beneath also breaks ground in an unconventional way.  The film reminds me of a Hitchcock film, Rear Window.  The characters spend most of their time in the home waiting for the action to come to them. Its hard to say a whole lot about What Lies Beneath without giving away much of the story.  Hopefully this film will renew interest in Harrison Ford and in Michelle Pfeifer.  The film is fun, scary, and I would recommend it to anyone!",What Lies Beneath

That is what you get when you stab the back of your loyal audience.Good thriller overall. ""What Lies Beneath"" is actually two thrillers, ""Rear Window"" meets ""Aquaphobia."" Pfifer steals the show and proves that there are brains behind the beauty.Miranda Otto is memorable as an abused(?)wife. It is good to see Diana Scarwin is a ditsy role, given her ""Holier than thou"" performance in ""Psycho III."" Ford is too convincing as the besieged husband of Pfifer. I thought that it was interesting that after being named People's Sexiest Man, Ford and his lovely wife Melissa Mathison divorced. Maybe this role was too close to the actual Harrison Ford.",What Lies Beneath

If this film didn't have Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in it, it would have gone straight to video.  All that can be said is that Zemeckis does do a good job directing as always, but it's not enough to save this waste of celluloid.Bad Points:  This is a cheesy suspense flick full of annoyingly loud BOO!s designed to make women cling to their men in terror.  This kind of movie stopped being cool about twenty years ago.  The plot is mundane and predictable, and since there are no interesting visuals to speak of, that's about all this kind of movie has going for it.Bottom Line:  It sucks.",What Lies Beneath

There are some tense moments throughout the movie and one really really big jump scare. However, most of it is just characters getting extremely lucky. And throughout the entire movie, Michelle Pfeiffer's character is walking around doing mundane things in a very very very slow manner. She walks down the door slowly. She blow dries her hair slowly. She walks to her room very slowly. It's almost as if she is a robot who has been programmed to move at the slowest speed possible. The funny thing is, I didn't mind watching her walk and talk and pour wine and wash her hands as if she were just trying to take up time throughout the day as slowly as possible. She can even do that in an entertaining manner. The storyline though? Meh. Not that great. Plus there are so many questions left unanswered. But I'll say it again and again, watch the movie if you like a slow movie lead actress.",What Lies Beneath

324,rosco29,When good directors make bad films,4,29 May 2001,"I came in to this film expecting nothing more than a good, entertaining, supernatural tinged thriller. What I (and my thriller-loving wife) got was derivative and predictable.Western Union couldn't have telegraphed the plot points any better. One cliche seemed to pop up after another. No real scares, not even truly creepy.Whose fault? Bad writing, mostly. The cast gave it their best shot, the sound work was great, and Stan Winston studios provided some excellent work. But, I think I can honestly say I found this to be the worst film Bob Zemekis ever directed.Looking for a better thriller?

From the ever popular ""oh is that a ghost!? ;SCREAM; Oh! It's you Sparky, thank goodness"" scene to the over used ""Writing in the steam on the bathroom mirror"" trick.This movie was so predictable, I was ready to walk out a half hour before the movie was over without any fear that I would miss anything.  It was a struggle to stay for the entire thing without standing up and leaving, or at the very least cracking up with laughter at how bad this movie is.From the very beginning it tries too hard to be a scary movie.  Watching the neighbor crying through the fence in the middle of the day does NOT deserve suspenseful music.There are lots of popular horror movies out there.  They all have something going for them, something different that makes them special.  ""What Lies Beneath"" just doesn't.  It doesn't have the humor of ""Scream"", it doesn't have the camp value of the ""Evil Dead"" series, it doesn't have the teen appeal of ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", it doesn't have the originality of ""The Blair Witch Project"", it doesn't have the pure suspense of the ""Alien"" series, and it doesn't have the surprise ending of ""The Sixth Element"".If you like predictable make-you-jump scary movies, this could be the one for you.

It's a shame because then all the twists and turns would not have been so predictable.  I will agree with others who say that Michelle's performance makes it worthwhile.  She does a fine job.  Harrison Ford has too many emotions that are unexplained and his performance is not one of his best (see The Fugitive or Indiana Jones, for that matter).Overall it was entertaining to watch despite it's slow presentation. Camera work and sound were good.  Plot was given away in the trailers, too bad.",What Lies Beneath

Bob Zemeckis is a great director but this is one of his lesser efforts. There is nothing really wrong with the film except looking at the marquee names one would have expected more. It has ghosts, jump scares and spooky music- even great locations but it is better suited as a film made by a first time director not the guy who made Back to the future or Contact. Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfieffer add allure to the star cast but you can clearly see by their motions they are pondering on when the cheque will clear.",What Lies Beneath

I have seen other comments from people who didn't like the fact that they cast Mr. Ford as the killer but that is one of the things that I thought was interesting. It is refreshing to see actors play different roles. I may have enjoyed this movie even more if I hadn't read the synopsis of the movie before I watched it. The info I read claimed the movie was about a couple who deals with something that happened a year ago - thus I knew it could not have anything to do with the neighbor. I thought it was an entertaining movie nontheless but I am a sucker for great camera work and it also has solid acting.

This supernatural ghost story improves itself the closer it gets to the ending.  Why?  Because Zemeckis completely fails to generate any suspense in the opening scenes.  Instead of using the slow buildup as in ""The Haunting,"" I wish he had looked back to 1982's ""Poltergeist"" to see how a fast-paced, scary ghost story is made.  Without Harrison Ford and especially Michelle Pfeiffer this would've been unbearable.  But, unlike ""The Haunting,"" this one does eventually kick into high gear as the story becomes more of a cliched, stalker thriller.  I would rather see another movie with a woman running for her life, than one where she walks around the house staring at pictures that keep falling on the floor.",What Lies Beneath

Put together a weak and predictable plot, some confusing neighbors, one of the worst endings in film history (up there with A.I. and The Bone Collector), and you have What Lies Beneath.

Watch Mosquito Coast to see just how menacing the man can really be.Scary and haunting? Not compared to real spinechillers such as The Changeling.Tense, dramatic and manipulative? Try Memento instead.Ultimately, What Lies Beneath, is a catalogue of half-measures. The fact that you've seen it all before shouldn't be a problem, so long as the old cliches are given a new slant, but the movie doesn't even go that far. What's worse is the fact that the movie starts slow, and grinds to a halt within the first hour.

To give you an idea of how scary some scenes were - I went to see it at the cinema with my mom, and there was a woman next to the aisle (an empty seat between her and my mom). During one especially startling scene everyone in the audience jumped and got scared, but the aisle woman (who we didn't know) shrieked in absolute terror, reached over to my startled mom (clutching on to her for dear life), and practically landed in her lap!!

One on the most anticipated movie of the summer (and the year) will stay in memory for a long time.Forget THE SIXTH SENSE, now, WHAT LIES BENEATH must remember our attention. The thriller of the decade is coming, no exaggeration. In the way of Alfred Hitchcock's movies and Jan De Bont's THE HAUNTING, this supernatural movie goes the moving. A lot of screams, a lot of shivers, a lot of adrenalins, a lot of... success. Hollywood like this kind of movie, but this one will haunt you until your bath...Skilfully, Zemeckis (FORREST GUMP, BACK TO THE FUTURE 1-2-3) plays with his camera with extraordinary travelling and panoramic shot show us the emotional and scary scene. More, his high and low angles shots will give you a cold back. Two thumbs up for his great job and work (watch the bath scenes).The subject itself is important and great in the circumstances when (this) director filming scenes. With a really lively intrigue, the actors find them easily on the scenes, indeed the house. What ? because the real interest takes place inside of the house with his supernaturals movements and worrying jumps.Two flops in a row together (Random Hearts for FORD; The story of us for PFEIFFER), Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer form an energetic and poignant chemistry. But it's any more Pfeiffer the revelation of this film with a brilliant and hard performance psychologically and physically. The film hinges completely on his perfomance, his best since BATMAN RETURNS.ZEMECKIS-PFEIFFER-FORD: a perfect trio results an excellent supernatural thriller; a perfect production results a dynamic suspense; and a perfect acting results an exciting movie for the summer...

Great acting from Harrison Ford and Michelle Phiffer really make this movie what it is...A good thriller.  They convey the feelings very well. Robert Zemeckis is also a great director and the angles he uses in this film help give it that extra mysteriousness. The movie is also driven by its great soundtrack, reminiscant of Psycho-esque music. The movie is not exactly scary, but it is a little freaky.

When I saw it the first time I had no expectations, I don't even think I knew what the storyline was since I saw it by mere chance. And I was pleasantly surprised I must say. Thrillers/mystery/horror movies are my favourite genre but too many movies are ruined because they are too exaggerated and over the top. This one isn't. It has a great storyline and at least to me, it wasn't predictable. The villain is not who I thought it would be and the reason behind it is not something I would have guessed. I love that about movies. I rarely find movies scary but this is one of the few that gives me that eerie feeling. I love that!! Some scenes actually affected me so much that I find it somewhat unpleasant to look in the mirror in the bathroom if there's mist on it, to swim in lakes when I can't see what's beneath the surface etc.The actors are good (ofcourse). Michelle Pfeiffer is one of my favourite actresses even from before this movie, not to mention how incredibly beautiful she is.

352,ZMattZ78,Much Better Than Expected,7,25 November 2000,"I saw this movie months ago, but I can still think of it as one of the scarier movies I've seen in a long while. The only recent other horror movie that shook me up was ""The Sixth Sense"", but even that didn't put me on the edge of my seat like ""What Lies Beneath"" did.And as for mixing different themes into the movie I think it gave the movie something the audience could relate to, but not entirely enough so that it was boring.I think that the slow camera and actor movements were the best part to scaring the hell out of me. I give this 4.5 out of 5 stars. I think Robert Z. did a great job with the special effects and the direction of this movie.",What Lies Beneath
353,Big Sexy Moltres,"Spoiler! don't read unless you saw the movie, but why would anyone want to?",1,30 July 2000,"Ok. Like I said, spoilers. You've been warned.    I was reluctant to see ""What Lies Beneath' at first, because the previews didn't make it look very good. However, when it recieved great reviews from the local newspapers, so I decided to give it a try. I should have stuck with my first instincts. Apparently, nobody in this movie had decided what it was supposed to be. Although I agree that not everything has to be classified into one genre, it had too many things going on at once. What was at first a 'Rear-Window' type voyeurism-murder mystery quickly turned into a ghost story, which succeded in switching back and forth between a Hitchcock-wanna be and a quasi-'Scream' 'who's the killer?' rant. And what can I say? By the end, it was sheer comedy. The subplot with the maybe-murderer next door neighbor was quickly forgotten and never explained. The neighbor's wife turns out to be living, sure, but what was in the body bag her husband was loading into the trunk? And how do you explain the bloody shoe? The sad truth is, they didn't. At all. I also had problems with the ending. What could have been a truly suspenseful cliffhanger ending was dragged on just about forever. I couldn't even believe the cheesy underwater scene with the 50's B-movie quality special effects. The writers also tried way too hard to elude to Hitchcock movies, adding the unnecessary 'Rear-Window' bit, not to mention the obvious twist on the 'Psycho' shower scene, although Hitchcock's movies never touched supernatural subjects. It looked like they were aiming for unpredictability in uncovering the killer's identity, however, in a movie this chock-full of Hitchcock rip-offs, anyone named Norman is looking awfully shady....",What Lies Beneath
354,vukodlak,I am not impressed,3,6 March 2001,"It starts off relatively well - Claire and Norman have a seemingly ideal marriage but then one day Strange Things begin to happen... And that's where the first problem is. Strange Things indeed do happen - a LOT. Here are a few (I probably missed out a couple): fans stop working, doors open by themselves, pictures fall, computer turns itself on and sets solitaire high scores (!), a dog will not go onto the pier (complete with the famous `what's the matter, boy?' line from 1000s of horror films where dogs generally have about three times the IQ of anyone else), a neighbour probably murders his wife, bloodstains, bathtubs that fill by themselves and last but not least an enormous number of creaky doors. Oh and did I mention that Claire and Norman live in an isolated house (well, there is a couple next door but they kinda disappear in the second half of the movie) very close to a deep lake? Now don't get me wrong, I LIKE this kind of thing, especially the Strange Things & Ominous Signs but you really CAN have too much of a good thing. Take for instance the front door - it opens by itself so often that in one scene Claire seems reluctant to use the keys and just waits for some nice little poltergeist to open it for her. Oh and by the way the doors are all amazingly creaky except the one that opens spontaneously - I guess the ghost keeps that one oiled so it can open it silently while no-one is looking.Right. All of this happens ONLY when Claire is alone - preferably at night and if at all possible during a thunderstorm. She's often alone in the house because Norman is a geneticist, you see, and has to work in the lab a lot (the film takes great care to inform us that, apart from genetics, the lab also works on tranquillisers for mice - AND OTHER MAMMALS. No prizes for guessing on what other mammals it will be used in this film).But the story really does not matter much in a horror film. What matters is the atmosphere. Is this film scary? Well... yes and no. There a lot of BAH! moments (when something suddenly appears on screen followed by a loud noise) and I do mean a lot - almost in every scene (the film actually opens with one)! That unfortunately is the problem - because these are so frequent we more or less get used to them and they lose their effect. So the first hour and a half are definitely NOT scary - they contain many Ominous Signs, many sudden loud noises, many, many plot holes and one very funny visual gag. But then, when the identity of the real murderer is revealed (in the unlikely case there is anybody in the audience who hasn't got it yet) things start to get better. What follows is the second scariest bathroom scene of all time, and one of the very few film moments that scared me so much I actually jumped out of my seat.",What Lies Beneath

359,Djeus,Deep and brilliant horror by Zemeckis,10,27 September 2002,"This is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. Robert Zemeckis really seems to have a knack about death as you compare this to his previous title ""Death becomes her"". A little warning however: If you are going to watch this film you are better off not knowing too much specifics about the plot. It may dampen the feeling a little.This film begins with quite an easy feeling. You just have some ordinary people living their ordinary lives. But there are also other forces at work you can`t see with your eyes. The plot thickens as the film goes by  and it gets more and more horrible. A really remarkably well built tension mounts and in the end you feel like screaming. Especially if you are watching this alone in the dark room.I think this film has something more in it than just the ""horror feeling"". To my opinion the plot is a really remarkable one. It is brilliant, deep and horrifying (I`m not talking about special effects here). It goes all the way to the darkest places in human mind. You begin to wonder of what we humans are really capable. The plot also has some very surprising shifts. Just when you think you have adapted to this deep horror you get swept off your feet.
If you are ready to face your deepest fears just wait till nightfall, turn off the light and watch this film.",What Lies Beneath
360,gsat143,Less Gore More Screams....,7,20 October 2009,What Lies Beneath is one of the movies which makes you scream your head off. Though the starting was kinda dull and the film was slow at places on the whole the director has made a great effort in scaring us.Michelle Pfeiffer has made a genuine attempt. Her body language is perfect and she looks more sexy even at her age. Her eyes speaks volumes. The rerecording is certainly commendable. This film will make you squirm in your seats with tension. The subtle twists in the story at unexpected places is an added advantage.More romantic scenes would have helped. The slow unraveling of the story does the trick. The climax was unexpected though. I'll credit this movie a 7/10. Horror lovers should surely try this.,What Lies Beneath
361,wencer,Awful for so many reasons,1,20 January 2003,"I recall seeing this one summer in high school when tickets had gone up something upwards of two dollars in a month.  I wouldn't have minded the increase if the movies being made were better, or at the very least, NOT inspiring me to have my eyes slowly eaten out by ravens or vultures or what-have-you. This ""movie"" (and i use the term loosely) was excrutiatingly abysmal. The main problem, of course, is that Harrison Ford plays a villain.  Oops, that may have been a spoiler, although if you're reading this review and STILL want to see this bile, I can only say ""I warned you"" and take solace in the fact that there are other people in the world that will also be permanently stupider for having seen it.  But back to Harrison Ford: There's a reason why he doesn't play bad guys, and that reason is that he can only make about three faces: smug, blank, and momentarily enraged.  This makes him ideal for Richard Kimble, Hans Solo and Indiana Jones.  This makes him awful as a genuine bad guy.  Now one can argue that this was a good casting move, making his villainy more of a shocker.  The person making this argument would, however, be wrong; Ford's ""evilness"" is so obvious from the get-go that the revelation is rather embarrassing for all concerned (which, fortunately, did not include me). Other gaping problems include Ford's character dying every five minutes,Michelle Pfeiffer owning a pistol that stores 17,000 bullets, some annoying shots on a dock which completely ruin any pacing the movie may have been struggling to acquire, and a dog with a funny name (which i wisely have blocked from my memory).  And don't even get me started on the last scene. Let's just say that underwater fight sequences involving people dead for several years make me laugh until stomach acid comes out my eyes. In fact it was so funny that a few weeks later, myself and a few friends pre-drank a second screening (a friend got us free passes, and how the movie was still in theatres is beyond me) so that we could tear the movie apart in a way that makes Statler and Waldorf look like yes-men. If you see this movie, be prepared to become a bark-eating hermit and recluse yourself from society.  I saw it two years ago and still sport the scars...",What Lies Beneath
362,ddt_eagleeye,One of the most frightening thrillers of the new millennium,8,26 May 2014,"With this movie Mr. Zemeckis showed the world that he is not only capable of directing action adventures like ""Back to the Future"" or dramas like ""Cast Away"", but also decent and thoroughly creepy thrillers.What makes this movie stand out for me is the fact that it gets into your head. There is a sense of foreboding throughout the entire playtime that grips you and won't let go until the credits roll. You start to question your own sanity instead of the protagonists'. It preys on your mind and plays with your senses.True, there are jump scares, misdirections and several other typical instruments of horror film making in this movie. Fortunately though it never gets cheap and keeps the suspense coming in a spooky crescendo without showing any monsters, brutal blood sheds or slasher villains. The music works well and the cinematography is a feast for the eye.In essence, this is a movie you don't want to miss if you're a fan of psychological horror films and/or the directing work of Robert Zemeckis. Enjoy it alone in a light-dimmed room with a good glass of wine and it will unfold its magic. You have my word.",What Lies Beneath
363,gordon_brennan,A Subpar Delivery From Zemeckis,6,16 September 2009,"How can something that was going so right end up going so wrong? That was the question I kept asking myself after exiting Robert Zemeckis' latest film, What Lies Beneath. The supernatural thriller stars Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer as Norman and Claire Spencer, a successful and seemingly happy middle-aged couple whose only daughter (Katharine Towne) has just gone off to college. However, their perfect little life together doesn't last long as a result of Claire's changing mental state. The question of Claire's sanity first comes into play early on in the film as a result of Claire's obsession of spying on her new next-door neighbors, Warren & Mary Feur (Rear Window anyone?). Based on what she has seen, or rather what she thinks she has seen and the seeming disappearance of Mary, Claire begins to suspect that Warren has murdered his wife. Claire's suspicions are then taken to a new level as strange occurrences begin to happen throughout the house, ranging from doors that open on their own to the mysterious nature of the family's bathroom, which marks the location of Claire's first vision of a mysterious woman, in one of the film's more memorable scenes. Claire is nearly convinced that Mary has come back from the dead, but at the same time still aware of the possibility that it may all just be in her head. As the visions continue Claire drifts further and further away from her former self, while the relationship between her and her husband does the same. Eventually, Claire can no longer take it and must find out the truth for herself. And then the film takes its first major twist, which I won't give away but was already all but revealed in the film's trailer. The first twist is a good one and really gets the film into gear, ultimately leading to another of the film's more memorable scenes in which we see Claire seducing Norman in a manner that is very un-Claire like given her personality. The scene also includes my favorite shot in the film, which again for spoiler reasons I won't give away (pay attention to Claire's eyes in the scene and you can't miss it) and marks the beginning of the film's next major twist. And it was with this next major twist that the film first begins to fall flat. The film could have gone a number of ways given its psychological and supernatural elements, but instead plays it safe and follows the same old thriller path that we have all grown accustomed too, which just doesn't fit with the flow of the first 2/3 of the film and is extremely disappointing given some of the possibilities that the film's first major twist hint to and could have led to. Despite the lackluster third act Zemeckis, Pfeiffer and Ford are able to pull it off reasonably well given what they have to work with as the final bathroom scenes is another of the film's best. But instead of ending it there Zemeckis can't resist himself, as an additional 15 minutes or so of film full of plenty of ""jump"" scenes follows. This period of the film is absolutely mind boggling to me, not only because it continued to remind me of how lackluster the film's third act really was, but also because the film's end result is basically the same as the result of the bathtub scene, only much, much less effective. It's a shame too, as I really did enjoy the first 2/3 of What Lies Beneath. The film is full of very interesting shots throughout, and through the use of its score in association with some of those shots (especially anything focusing on either a mirror or water) was able to produce some genuine terror and suspense especially once the foreshadowing of these scenes has become apparent. Michelle Pfeiffer is very good in her role as Claire, as she pulls off being either scared and or unstable whenever her part called for it without ever appearing over the top. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for Ford, as the script just doesn't give him enough to work with, something that I feel weakens the film's ending even further given the path it does take. The unnecessary extension of the film, which also happened to be the only problem I had with Zemeckis' Oscar Winning film, Forrest Gump, in addition to the obvious Hitchcock visual and plot references to Psycho, Vertigo and the previously mentioned Rear Window that are laced throughout the film, and the excess and foreshadowing of ""jump"" scenes are a pretty good indication that Zemeckis was really playing around with both the thriller genre and the audience at the same time. While I enjoyed that to a certain extent, it eventually becomes tiresome, as there was just too much of it by the end of the film and because of it the film itself ultimately suffers here as well. If you're a fan of the genre itself I still recommend this film, as despite its downfalls, I still found it in parts to be more terrifying than most other so called thrillers released as of late. What Lies Beneath isn't a bad film; it isn't a very good film either, but at the same time based on its first two acts alone had the makings of being a great film. If only it had ended 15 minutes sooner and if only had it taken a chance.",What Lies Beneath
364,minna,We've seen this hundred times before,3,21 April 2001,"For the first time Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer can be seen in one movie together. And the screenplay is unfortunately a composition of many films in this genre that we' seen hundreds of times with lesser known actors. It doesn't take long that you suspect Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford) lying behind everything that happens there, because he doesn't believe his wife. The perfect fassade with a congenious scientist married to a retired extremely talented musician (Pfeiffer) has something beneath. Spencer betrayed his wife a year ago and has killed the girl who wanted to ruin his career... Now he is willing to kill his beloved wife too, she is able to escape several times, but as an experienced spectator of thrillers like this you know that he will come back - as badly injured as he is. And of course she will win, escaping death and rescuing herself in the last second.

All you had to do was notice that any scene outside of the house was going to come back into play, for example:*****SPOILER*************** The lab people talking about a potion that paralyzes you. The fact that you can't use the cell phone until you are halfway over the bridge.*****SPOILER************** At the end when the ghost is floating in the water it looked just like the scene from Titanic.  I thought the only goofy comic book thing they could do was to have the piece of jewelry drop through the water like at the end of Titanic.  Sure enough they threw that in there.

Well, what of it? If these two factors were done poorly (as they are in many films) then there would be a problem. But 'What Lies Beneath' oozes quality from start to finish and I think Hitchcock would have a wry smile on his face watching this film.All the filmic tricks of the trade are used in this film, but used subtly and used intelligently.My only criticism, is perhaps the very last 7 or 8 minutes where I think things go just a little over the top but otherwise this is a tense, palm-sweating film.

377,Joshy-3,Unmotivated and un'spirit'ed,1,7 December 2000,"*Waring contains spoiler*   well, to say this for the filmmaker, it started out promising, a quirky beginning to the plot entails with an exit of a family member to college and the entrance of a spooky entity who throughout the whole movie and even after, you question why was there in the first place. This is the first horror movie where the horror wasn't the integral plot point. Strange you ask? uh-huh. I'm confused too. Lets say leave out the spooky ghost stuff (At the beginning) re work some scenes and you have a perfectly serviceable Tom Clancy (Patriot Games)style mystery complete with the REAL villain in the original film. Or say this, take out human villain, leave spooky stuff, minus half hearted mystery, dump the superfluous neighbor plot add some more spooky and special effects and there you have yourself a true thriller.Personally when I go to see a supernatural thriller I want to see supernatural stuff and have it all make sense, in this film we never know why the girl is haunting them (well we kinda do) but you go back to the old Hollywood cliche ""where's your motivation?"" it was just kinda there and wasn't only to come in until the plot dulled, it gives me the shivers now, not cause its scary, but because its so whacked and stupid. Imagine this: Say you're watching the Generals Daughter, and every once in a while the girl reappears to scare the hell out of John Travolta or whomever the director feels needs to see the presence. Or even if Mel Gibsons slain wife in Braveheart came back to exact revenge on the king. You'd say ""that was unnecessary"" as it is here.Also some major plot points are thrown in so quick and obscurely that I heard people in the theater whisper ""what did that mean?"" sure you may be in a time frame but lets rewrite some scenes so they flow. Its sloppy to confuse the audience right away.Maybe next time Mr. Zemeckis, you've wowed us with House on Haunted Hill, Contact, Roger Rabbit, Back to the Future and Gump, (heck I was fully expecting to see a Frighteners style experience) don't let Cast Away fall by the way side with talking monkeys or helicopters made from bamboo and coconuts, if it doesn't fit leave it out, movies will make so much more sense without ten thousand contrasting plot elements in a movie. But hey you've done so much good, we forgive you for what lies beneath.I'm sorry if any of this did not make sense, see the movie and read this again, you'll understand that there's so much to be said for the movie that it cannot be expressed in words, just an utter sense of confusion",What Lies Beneath

380,dbratton,"Creepy, and very enjoyable",8,26 July 2000,"If Alfred Hitchcock had grown up reading Tales from the Crypt, this is a movie he very well might have made. Thankfully, Robert Zemeckis has done a great job turning what would have been just another trite ghost story into that rarity of summer movies: an intelligent scary movie. Zemeckis is obviously influenced by the many works that have gone before in this genre. There are many obvious nods to Hitchcock, the afore mentioned Tales, and others; but Zemeckis never over does it. This is a movie that takes its time, the suspense and tension are slowly, oh so very slowly, cranked up bit by bit until you find yourself fairly squirming in your seat and gripping the arm rests. The work here is masterful. Zemeckis toys with convention, allowing us to see certain ""surprises"" coming. The thing is, with all the moments that are obviously acknowledging other films, it's hard to call these moments trite. Instead, I think Zemeckis is using them to lull us into a complacency, into thinking, ""Ah ha! I know where he's going now."" And then he does something just different enough to keep us involved. It results in a structure that allows him to deliver jolt after jolt, and deliver is exactly what Zemeckis does, raising the ante each time. This is not a slam-bang slash fest. This is a slowly developing thriller that ultimately delivers the goods. A great summer movie, and a great date movie if you want her to hang on to you.",What Lies Beneath
381,MichaelJMcNeese,Much better than expected,9,13 August 2000,"ive not seen RANDOM HEARTS, nor do i desire to, but after ford's performance in that film, i was expecting him to drag pfeiffer down with him in this movie. but i was very surprised at how well the entire movie was put together. the story wasnt groundbreaking, but it was presented excellently. the acting was the best i have seen this year. and the post-production team did a wonderful job at making you sit at the very edge of your seat, for a very long time, too it seems. the suspense is almost too much. most of the film is noticeably silent, and the floating/panning camera work, along with very long cuts make many parts of the movie very nerve racking. it reminded me a lot of hitchcock films. it had a lot of hitch's characterstics in it--if you are a hitch fan you will love this movie. if you just like to see a really good movie, that doesnt have any flaws, then you will love this too!!! 9/10",What Lies Beneath

My opinion is that it is poorly cast, poorly directed, poorly scripted, etc., etc., etc; however, I do give it an A for set-decoration.The movie moves like an inch-worm.  It's lack of subtlety is appalling. It is flagrant in its attempt to frighten, and, thereby, loses it's appeal.Harrison Ford was the wrong person for the role.  In fact, he has become tiresome, as far as I am concerned; therefore, I shall avoid his movies in the future.  Michelle Pfeiffer might have given a better performance under a better director.When I returned home, after having seen this movie, I rang my daughter who loves thrillers to see what she had thought of it.  Her response to it was as mine had been.  She gave it a 'thumbs-down'.It is really too bad that this story was so mis-handled because the story, itself is a good one.  Too bad that it was not in better hands.",What Lies Beneath
384,butthead-3,You will be so disappointed,3,30 December 2000,"Probably one of the most predictable and boring movies of this year. The plot is so stupid that it is insulting to the viewer. It takes about 25 minutes of the movie to figure out how it is going to end. The ghost part of it contributes even more to the feeling that you really wasted your money this time. To find this movie scary you would have to be very young or have very little movie experience. The movie contains about 50 scenes where you know that in 2 seconds time, there will be a BOOOO effect and when it comes you do not get scared rather angry that you actually paid money to watch this rubbish.How Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford ever agreed to take part in this misery is a riddle to me, but I guess they were both paid good. Michelle Pfeiffer is to me one of the most beautiful women of the world - she almost gets better looking as she is getting older and her acting is very fine in this film, but it just is not enough. Avoid.",What Lies Beneath
385,bob.lindell,"Scary, spooky, in a way that reminds me of days gone by.",7,2 August 2000,"Oh man!! What a fun movie! Without giving too much away, it's a ghost movie. The plot wasn't anything to write home about, it's been done about 100 times before, but it was just done better than it has been in recent memory. Seems that movies try to over-do everything lately with special effects, gore, music and violence. Not here... I kept thinking that they had taken a step back and returned to what makes movies spooky. It's not a computer generated demon, or a high intensity soundtrack; it's a creaky door, it's a reflection in the glass, it's that feeling when you know you just pushed that chair in a minute ago and now it's away from the table again. That's what makes people uneasy, that's what makes them check their closets and sleep with the hall light on when they go home.The most notable difference in the movie was the silence. I'd guess that about 50% of the movie was completely silent except for breathing, footsteps, creaking doors... wonderful. Seems that lately the powers-that-be just have to fit every second of the soundtrack into the movie (seems they should since now-a-days there's commercials for the soundtrack separate from the movie in many cases) in order to boost the spooky level... it rarely works. The silence in the movie just added to that tension in your shoulders and made you slowly edge up on your seat.If I had to pick anything to complain about, it'd be the weak foreshadowing of two events, I don't want to give anything away, but you'll know when you see it. It's like they gave up on trying to write them into the plot. They may as well have put a subtitle on the screen (or a ""Pop Up Video"" bubble) that told you that what they were saying was important. For my wife and I, it gave a bit away about how the movie was likely to end.Michelle Pfeiffer was really good, I'd guess she was in almost every single shot in the film, so anything but a great performance would have shown. I'm not normally one to judge actors performances, but there's some credit to be given to someone who can act that scared using only her eyes. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets a nod at the academy for this one.",What Lies Beneath

Early on I figured out ""whodunnit"".  When it was disclosed who it was ""dun"" to, I knew why and how.

388,Ian-135,The worst movie ever made[Spoiler],1,17 September 2001,"These movies are meant to be a psychological horror that gradually builds up the suspense and leads to a heartstoppingly intense finale. The opening 20 minutes of this are quite good as it lets you see and feel the characters emotions and there are some effective frights but then it just deteriorates into a farce.The movie is laughably bad. I didn't laugh this much when I watched Meet The Parents. It's supposed to be akin to an Alfred Hitchcock movie. When did he make a comedy and advertise it as horror.Quite frankly this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
The ending is terrible. How Harrision Ford can get into that car after having his head sliced open I don't know. Also how can a dead person with no explanation as to why get up and drag him under the water.The performances are just as bad. Michelle Pfeiffer has about 10 anxiety attacks in the movie and Harrison Ford just can't be bothered to create a 3d character. All in all this pile of crap is not worth watching no matter who you are. I can't understand why any critics like it's style or visual effect. I saw better effects in Only Fools and Horses.* out of *****",What Lies Beneath

Not only could I not believe either Michelle or Harrison, but the plot was so usual and typical and done a thousand times before. The dialogs are choppy and almost seem ad lib.I give a three because hey, Michelle Pfeiffer is Michelle Pfeiffer. I can't follow the story, sorry. The critics of this movie in this case are right in the general perception of it's atrocity. Harrison Ford has his worst acting performance ever. I actually had high hopes for this movie, but I was let down tremendously. The supernatural effect was not developed enough and I was actually convinced the neighbor killed his wife. The actual explanation of the fact she wasn't killed was far fetched and so incredibly unbelievable. Slipping and hitting your head on a porcelain tub never seemed more unrealistic as well as the escape from a tub filling with water. There was no excitement in this movie what so ever. I was able to figure out each and every action before it actually happened and the way I figured it in my mind was a better version than the actual product.",What Lies Beneath

Is a very long movie, but it worth the time.

The ghost of the young woman is very creepy, and very original, i really though it was the neighbor, but it wasn't, make sure to see this movie, because i know you won't be disappointed. Is better than 'The Sixth sense""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I give a 10/10, for the acting and the story, i really did love it, and i could see it 2 times on the day, just for the amazing horror bad tub sequences.Make sure to watch it, it's amazing.",What Lies Beneath
393,martynl,Poor pacing spoils interesting concept,7,11 June 2002,"M. Night Shyamalan's understated 1999 The Sixth Sense demonstrated clearly how blood, guts and gore are ephemeral to successfully scaring audiences and keeping them on the edge of their seats. Robert Zemeckis' movie takes a similar, understated approach, but sadly is not building on the foundation of a compelling plot or comprehensible characters. Ford and Pfeiffer turn in good performances in their lead roles, but tension fails to build as it should. The picture feels over-long, but this is as much about poor pacing as it is about length. The movie is definitely worth seeing, if only because the first hour is quite suspenseful and enjoyable.Worth a shot. 7/10",What Lies Beneath

The trailers did a good job of not giving too much away, which most do, which probably contributed to the reason that I thought it would be different than what it was.I must have jumped a good ten times through this movie.

396,crossfire,Haunted by the spirit of Hitchcock,10,29 July 2000,"The most shocking thing about this movie was the very misguided reviews i've read on here.  I don't know why people think this movie was bad.  This movie would have been Hitchcock's best if he was alive and had directed it the exact same way.  But he didn't, and because of that people think it's stupid.  Why, I ask you?  Do you think that Hitchcock is the only one who can direct a movie that way?  Robert Zemeckis is simply creating a movie in the same style as Hitchcock did.  People ought to be thrilled that they get to see a new movie in that style!  I enjoyed this film to the very best. The scene at the end has the word classic written all over it!  This movie adds things that hitchcock lacked.  I recommend this movie to any hitchcock fan!  And I spit on the people that gave this movie a bad review, you have no taste!  The only thing I didn't like was the way Harrison Ford acted at the end.  He didn't do a good job of that.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone so I won't say anything else.  This is the kind of movie where you can't say much about the plot or you'll spoil it.  So I have simply told you why I liked it so much.  So go and enjoy it, it's a movie made to thrill, excite, and entertain.  It does all three of those, and does them well. Who cares if it's cliche, that's what makes it great!!  It's like watching a classic.  I gave it 10 out of 10!! And believe it to be the scariest movie I have ever seen!",What Lies Beneath

I found myself predicting just about every boo scene, like when she was in the bathroom and the dog came in. Michelle Pfeiffer did good job with the material they gave her, but just about anybody could have played the husband. I think the film could have brought about more tension if the apparent supernatural happenings were either: 1. not explained by the ending or 2. explained by human deviousness and evil.

It combines aspects of ""Rear Window"", ""Sixth Sense"", and ""Stir of Echos"". After you leave the theater, you rerun the movie in your head trying to put all the pieces together and the great thing is, all the pieces fall into place and make sense.

Before I went to see the film I read some articles about it, they all said it wasn't original and at the end very unbelievable. Well, it may be a little unbelievable at the end, but hey, it was original and I really think the rest of the film was original as well! The whole cinema was breathless during the break because of the excitement. And when Michelle turned blue in the bathtub, I really thought I was going to have a heart attack.

400,etagle,This movie gots the Macgruffon going on!Warning Spoilers,9,21 July 2000,"This is by far the best suspense movie I have seen in a long time.What Lies Beneath is much more frightening than the Sixth Sense and far more Spine Tingling than the Blair Witch Project.I literally found this movie near perfect.Towards the end I nearly p***ed my pants, because it was so terrifying.Practically through out the whole movie I had goose bumbs all over my body.It's slow at first like people been saying but it gradually builds up more suspense that you hardly even notice.It even has it's moments in the begining for the people who are afraid that it might be boring at first.This film instally reminded of a Hitchcock film.Everything from the score,the camera angles,and the plot.I honestly think that Alfred Hitchcock would be very proud of the movie.The story evolves around Michelle Pfeiffers character Claire.Her daughter has just gone off to college and she is feeling some what lonely.Her husband Norman(HarrisonFord) is really obsessed with work and tries to live up to the success of his father that left them the beautiful New England they now live in.In the beginning Claire witnesses a fight between their next store neighbors.Than she starts sensing that there a ghost in the house.Claire is convinced that the ghost is the wife next door and believes that the husband killed her.After awhile she confronts the neighbor and realizes that she made a mistake and soon finds out that it is the spirit of a missing girl Norman had an affair with.A plot point I wish they hadn't givin away in the trailer,so that the twist would have been more surprising.After Claire finds out the movie gets more creepy and more suspenseful.Michelle Pfeiffers performance was very very good and I really think she might get a Golden Globe nomination and possibly an Oscar nod.The only problem I had with What Lies Beneath is Harrison Fords performance.It definitly isn't his best peformance.It he didn't even felt like he was trying, like he was to big to be in a supernatual thriller so it wasn't worth the effort.I honestly think thats true because Ford has bluntly expressed his non belief in supernatual forces.But the rest of the cast is very good and his dud performance is hardly noticed.Personlly, I think this is the best film this year right behind Erin Brocovich.The story is handled very well and the movie is made superbly.It also proves that Zemeckis directs the best movie.Its like Alfred Hitchcock takes on Fatal Attraction.And remember Fatal Attraction was nominated for Best Picture and Hitchcock is wildly considerd one of the best Directors of all time.9 out of 10!",What Lies Beneath

It's also nice to see Harrison Ford do some more good acting.All in all, it's simply a cool movie.  It keeps your attention, though slightly predictable, and throws in some neat little 'things to watch for' much like The Sixth Sense.  The story isn't anything new, but it's told so well, and it was so thoroughly planned that you can't help but be intrigued by it.With cool camera work and a nice, twisted presentation, this movie makes viewing fun.

Actually one of the best movies I've seen for a couple of  months. We even liked it a bit more than 6th Sense, since it makes more sense and was scarier.I must admit, this is one of the scariest films I've ever seen and it's done with so much intelligence. Maybe that's why there are some people out there saying: ""Scream III was much more fun!"". If I had to chose one drawback it's the ending, that goes on for too long with too many shocks and effects. Almost the entire movie lacks annoying effects, and that's why it's so good.And I don't understand at all, why some guys complain about the story twist and the ""useless"" neighbour subplot. This is intelligent and realistic story-telling. And if you really think the subplot had ""nothing to do with the main story"", you didn't get the little innuendos.In my view this is one of Zemeckis best movies ever (and I've seen most of them). It's was way better than Forrest Gump and maybe as entertaining (though completely differently) than Back to the Future.",What Lies Beneath

To be honest, I now realised that I need new reliable friends.The 'twist' of the tale is what originally got me intrigued but the movie, unfortunately, had turned out to be a very 'well-executed' exercise of a fairly 'run-of-the-mill' ghost story. All the camera shots, set pieces and tricks within this film are done well but had all been seen and done before in countless other films.People has compared the film style to of Alfred Hitchcock (which one scene, uncannily, plays like 'REAR WINDOW') but frankly it had became TOO 'cliched'.The performances are fine, adequete for the job but yet not exceptional, and the cinematography is very good. Not the best film but yet not the worst film either. Very.... above average. Recommended for people who fancy watching a 'slightly- intelligent no-brainer'.",What Lies Beneath

It was pretty well done, all things considered.Michelle Pfeiffer is sexy as ever in this, but unfortunately Harrison Ford is just a bit over average in this film. he comes across as hammy and maybe even miscast. That's not to say he's not a good actor, he is, but he just seems too awkward in this movie playing the bad guy. The last thing that bothered me about this movie is the CGI effects, especially of the dead girl. They just didn't come off too great and for a big Hollywood film, it would be nice to get more better effects.

The first ten times they used Hitchcockian conventions to build suspense and then did nothing to pay them off, I was caught up in the suspense and then let down. By the eleventh time they did this, I started not to care. And when they paid off the mystery of the disappeared neighbor by essentially saying, ""Ha ha. Fooled you! The real story has nothing at all to do with the neighbor"" and started telling the real story, I was just waiting for the whole thing to end. If they're going to try to emulate Hitchcock's tricks, they should at least try to figure out what made them work rather than pasting them in haphazardly.",What Lies Beneath
409,zack4818,10 star movie until the very end.,9,31 January 2008,"This was a very good movie that had some brilliant acting and a very creative story. Michelle Pfieffer, Harrison Ford, Diana Scarwid, and some of the others were fantastic. I especially liked Diana Scarwid's character of Jody. She was very enlightening. Obviously for a mega budget film, it was great, usually films that have tons and tons of money behind it, lack heart and soul, but not this one. I would have given this a ten, but the very end was just too much, the part after Ford and Pfieffer are in the lake submerged in the truck as they are sinking. I don't wanna mention too much and give anything away. I just wish it would have ended a little different, but, oh well, this is still a great movie. One of the things that I truly appreciated was that it was very easy to follow and everything was coming together as to what was going and who this mysterious entity was and why she was there haunting Pfieffer's character. I find it a little surprising that the user rating for this movie is about 6.5, and movies like Die Hard 4 are at an 8 or so. Die Hard 4 is a perfect example of a movie with no heart and soul that just has explosions and Million Dollar Special FX and that that alone is supposed to make it a good movie. I DO NOT think so.

Michelle pfiffer has done a brilliant job, the whole movie rides on her soldier. Harrison ford is good and last but not the least the director ""Robert zemeckis"". Its because of him the movie didn't end up being a another cheap horror. This movie depends a lot on director's vision apart from its good writing.

411,celenazinc,Pretty cool thriller movie.,7,18 September 2005,"There are a few points where this movie lags. But it is actually pretty good overall. It's not ultra predictable like a lot of the newer ghost movies. And the ending is really good and freaky with the actual full visualization of the ghost underwater. The neighbor thing could have been a bigger part of the film. They started it out really well and then didn't go anywhere with it. The neighbors were written in freaky, but then just turn out to be butt heads pretty much. That was disappointing. Harrison Ford was cool in this film. Michel Pfeiffer did a good job, although her character was a little whiny at times. There was some cool back story added to her character that helped keep the movie from being predictable. The small role Wendy Crewson played was a nice addition. Always nice to see her in a film. I recommend this film for a laid back rainy evening at home.",What Lies Beneath
412,smile-2,I was so bored....,4,20 October 2000,"Well, I went to see this film with reasonably high expectations. I'd not read any reviews but the talents of Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Zemeckis convinced me to give it a try. I was, however, extremely disappointed.The acting was fine and there were more than enough twists and turns, but a lot of these could be seen coming a mile off and the script was simply bad. The worse thing though was that is was easily 30 minutes too long.  It was so tedious, I had difficulty in not yawning continually.  Most of many fellow cinema goers seemed to agree with me if the number of sighs of boredom and fidgeting were anything to go by.All in all I was thoroughly unimpressed and will think long and hard before bothering with a Robert Zemeckis film in the future.",What Lies Beneath
413,Hazzah,Better the more you watch it.,9,2 November 2003,"I've seen this movie three times now, and it keeps getting better.The plot: Pfeiffer is a former cello player that got into a horrible car accident a year before.  Her husband (Harrison Ford)is a very busy doctor working on a experiemental new anestisia. (spelling?) Suddenly, with her daughter grown and off to college, Michelle starts to feel a presence in the house.  This, mixed with paranoia from her new neighbors, begins to freak her out.  Along the way, we learn there are sinister and legitimate reasons why Michelle is seeing all these things.I'm not going to give away all the good stuff.The acting:  Pitch perfect.  These two actors are way too underrated.  I mean, c'mon!  All the years these two have made movies and only 4 Oscar nominations??  Again, they were passed over for this one.  Ford surely deserved at least a GOLDEN GLOBE! The script: One reason this movie gets better is because of the awesome script.  Just about every action is explained.  If the villian does something, and you're wondering why, just be patient. The whole plot about the neighbors at first seems pointless. However, when you pay closer attention the the goings-on surrounding that small plot, you understand what's happening. The SFX: Usually a movie in the ""thriller"" category doesn't have a whole lot of visual effects.  However, every so often one movie comes along that is enhanced by SFX.  What Lies Beneath is such a movie.  There are certain shots that are only available to story tellers now with the invention of CGI, therefore helping a great storyteller/director like Robert Zemeckis to make a Hitchcock style movie on behalf of Hitchcock. The movie overall: The music was used exceptionally well.  When you needed to be scared, the thunderous boom of the orchestra comes in.  However, when you need to be tense, there's not a note of music to be heard.  This technique makes it all the scarier.  The cinematography is beautiful, Michelle Pfeiffer has never looked so utterly gorgeous in a movie without a catsuit.Overall I give this movie a 8/10...and if I watch it a couple more times it'll probably move up to a 9/10.",What Lies Beneath

416,crossroadtheatre,Disappointed,1,26 July 2000,"Wow, what a truly poor film! What was Robert Zemeckis thinking? What was Harrison Ford thinking? What was I thinking going to see it? It is ridiculously cliche and an absurd concept. Robert Zemeckis hasn't made a really great movie since the first ""Back To The Future"" (no, ""Forrest Gump"" wasn't as smart and enjoyable as ""Back To The Future""). Michelle Pfeiffer does her usual fine job in performance. She is a real actress, though some of the material she has been given has been lackluster (""Grease 2"" and... well ""What Lies Beneath"") But even in those stink bombs, she does the best she can with the material. This movie is awful and rides on the names on the poster, not the quality of the movie. If you're trying to pick a movie, go see the X-Men, at least that's entertaining.",What Lies Beneath

But it turns awry at about the half-point of the movie, and becomes more and more ridiculous from there.Claire (Michelle Pfeiffer) believes she is being haunted by her former next door neighbor, who may have been murdered.  As she begins exploring the ghostly phenomenon, she discovers some of her husband's old secrets, previously forgotten after she suffered a severe car wreck. This is when the movie goes from fascinating and spooky to cheesy and shabby.  The scenes were overdone and this plot was 'already done'.Still, if you enjoy thrillers and mysteries, this would be a good one to look at.",What Lies Beneath

Granted,I usually like Harrison Ford, and this was a good role for him.  However, Robert Zemeckis seems to be obsessed with rich and affluent white people than about the horror story that this movie is suppossed to be about.  I think everything in the movie came out of L.L. Bean.  Anyways, I'm digressing...the movie is just plain bad...sure there is suspense in this movie, but it's minute. How many times are we suppossed to believe that Michelle Pfiefer is going to go into that bathroom?  And another thing, I'm all about adapting or taking some part of a previous movie and use it as an homage to great directors or movies, but I am tired of Zemeckis ripping off other movies and directors. Watch Diabolique or any good Hitchcock film and save yourself 2 hours of this immeasurable bore of a movie.",What Lies Beneath
419,stevencole1,A very good chiller of a movie!,10,22 October 2000,"I saw the movie What Lies Beneath yesterday, and to be honest I didn't expect much.  By the time the movie had finished, I had just seen a great film and some scenes had sent me completely cold/given me goosebumps.  The last movie to do this?  Final Destination , although What Lies Beneath doesn't rely on gore and has arguably better heart stopping moments.The movie is well crafted and has great subtle touches, the acting is ok and the special effects although minimal are effective.  The movie really picks up the pace towards the end, a real nail - biter for sure.After you have seen What Lies Beneath, count the number of occasions you jumped or were sent cold right through your body.  I bet you it won't be less than 3 times.....Enjoy the best horror (on a more subtle level) since Final Destination.",What Lies Beneath

For the first hour or so of the movie, despite being just a long, detailed version of the trailers, What Lies Beneath can really grab your interest. Though the trailer is a little misleading and confusing, which is reason enough to see it, you soon learn that it gave you, more or less, all you needed to know about the first hour.Despite all this, it (pretty much) keeps your interest. Now keep in mind: many of the events leading up to this had been far far far beyond reality, but they didn't tarnish the overall value tremendously. Then, with some of the bizarre and downright ugly twists the plot takes, the storyline becomes ""just another movie,"" or at least a movie with far too many scenes with Michelle Pfeiffer in the tub. It gets very old.Another thing gone wrong is the entire development and action of the characters. The male neighbor is all of a sudden so nice and almost playful at the party. This is just another loose end they decided to tie up the easy way.While some of the ideas appear fresh, it just turns into a tired, predictable mess of ""let's just have Harrison Ford be the bad one and tie it up in ten minutes"" proportions.A few good ""scare"" scenes, but they end up giving you far too many attempts at them, eventually ruining what had the chance to be an above average movie.5/10 Stars.",What Lies Beneath

422,indysolo,What Lies Beneath? Who Cares?,6,21 July 2000,"What Lies Beneath is not a horrible movie, its just not a very good one, which is a shame considering all of the talent involved.  Robert Zemeckis is an excellent filmmaker, Michelle Pfeiffer is a very capable actress and Harrison Ford, well he is my all time favorite movie star. Sounds like a recipe for success.  Unfortunately, it doesn't turn out that way, and I think the blame can be pointed squarely at the script.  The concept is great, but the execution is lacking.This film needed another draft.  The characters are flat, and the audience knows very little about them to care.  Sure we get glimpses as to who they are, but it isn't enough to carry a 130 minute film.  The acting is very good in the film, but again, it's not enough to just have good acting.  A stronger script would have made this movie a lot better.My other complaint regards Harrison Ford.  He is great in this film (not wooden as some would suggest).  We see a side to him he has never shown before, and the results are impressive.  However, I have a tough time accepting him in this role.  Part of that may have to do with the script, which makes a sudden turn out of nowhere.  It may also have to do with the character, which is certainly against type for himIt's really a shame, too because technically this movie is very well made. Zemeckis knows how to make a movie.  He is one of the top directors in the field, and this film shows us why.  The camera glides everywhere, yet it is never distracting.  Watch as it gracefully moves into a speeding truck. Notice the floor disappear at one point.  These are all pulled off amazingly well, thanks to Mr. Zemeckis' knack for storytelling flair and visual effects.Overall, its an interesting failure.  Well made, well performed, but missing the one final ingredient that all good movies have:  a decent script.",What Lies Beneath
423,adamfoo22,One fun Hitchcock homage is what lies beneath,10,23 July 2000,"If you go into What Lies Beneath expecting the next great horror movie of all-time, you'll be slightly disappointed, but if you go into the film willing to accept it for what it is: a big budget, big star Hitchcock homage by Robert Zemeckis, then you'll have a great time. Zemeckis pushes all the right scare buttons as the audience gets to see Michelle Pfeiffer going through a potentially haunted house. The story is a mishmash of great Hitchcock material:A little Psycho, A little Rebecca, A little Vertigo, A little bit of The Man Who Knew Too Much, and a whole lot of Rear Window. Most of the fun comes from picking out what elements are from what movie. Clark Gregg's screenplay has been criticized as being too old fashioned, but the question must be asked, How can you pay homage to Hitchcock without writing an old fashioned story? The only faults in the screenplay is that there are a few too many moments where the dialogue is a bit forced, but that's easily overlooked during the summer season. As for the performances, this is Pfeiffer's movie. She's the focus of act one and she runs with it. She makes a terrific target for haunting. Harrison Ford doesn't have much to do until he becomes directly involved with the hauntings late going, but as usual he gives an effortless performance. This will be a must buy on DVD for Ford fans. The perfect way to go into this movie is thoroughly blind. If you haven't seen the trailer for it yet, DON'T. It will ruin a lot of the fun for you. If you see a commercial on TV, go to the other room. If you go in blind, you'll be in for a terrific ride.",What Lies Beneath
424,echobase46,A suspense-filled masterpiece!,10,24 July 2000,"""What Lies Beneath"" has a uniqueness about it that helps it to stand out among the other films being released at the present time. The special attention to detail and character development is especially well done. The camera work and direction are the best part about this film, every inch of the theatrical screen is used very cleverly. Focus is put on the sides of the screen at times rather than the traditional center area. Again the camera work is brilliant, use of mirrors and different angles make it a very exciting, exhilarating film to view. And I love the fact that there are a lot of close, tight shots that don't reveal everything, making you wonder what lies an inch to the left or right (usually a surprise of some kind is waiting). With all that said the last 20 minutes or so take the twisting suspense that was built up throughout the film and unravels it like a roller-coaster. I can't spill the unraveling conclusion but I can say that the film itself is an idea of what Hitchcock's films might have become like if he were still alive. I recommend this to everyone 100%!!!!",What Lies Beneath

We are emersed in the lives of these individuals and their secrets through the angles of the lens.  The use of mirrors throughout the film are both mesmerizing and suspenseful.

429,almaier,A big giant mess!,1,26 January 2001,"Perhaps the most over-rated film of 2000, this is one of Zemeckis' worst movies. The only redeeming feature of this film is great acting by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does what she can with this script. The problem with this film is that it can't decide on what genre to be, so it just jumbles it all together.On one hand, it's an eerie ghost story. But then, it turns into a good- husband-turns-bad story. Then, it becomes a psychological drama about a lonely wife with an empty nest. Add to that a totally pointless subplot about strange neighbours living next door whose actions are never addressed.Yes, there are some scary suspenseful scenes. But the plot is a big mess. One minute Pfeiffer is a lonely woman in a haunted house, and the next minute she's evil and writhing on the floor at Harrison Ford.
This movie gets more and more ridiculous as it progresses. Avoid this horrible mess.",What Lies Beneath

431,myrto1,A GREAT SUSPENSE FILM!,10,25 August 2002,"` What lies beneath ' is a thriller worth watching again and again. It holds on the Hitchcockian tradition, providing misleading elements, interesting characters, an atmosphere of mystery and an unexpected ending. The film is about a happily married couple - maybe too happy  which lives with their daughter in a beautiful manor by the sea. He, Norman Spencer is a successful scientist who holds Dupont Genetic Chair as well as the perfect husband and father. She, Claire Spencer is an attractive wife and a caring mother who is very close to her friend Jody. It all seems too perfect But underneath the still surface lies a sinister secret that waits to be discovered.It's only when daughter Caitlin moves out for college that strange things start to happen. The door keeps opening by itself, the computer is switched on by an invisible hand, the bathtub fills constantly with hot water and a photograph showing Claire and Norman falls down again and again. Claire hears strange whispers and sees a ghostly woman face in the water of the bathtub and the lake. Claire starts to suspect that the neighbor has murdered his wife and is determined to prove it. But then, many turns in the plot follow and the audience feels both surprised and shocked.As for the acting, the performances of the whole cast and especially of the leading trio, are brilliant. Diana Scarwid is very effective and innovative as Jody providing the film with an amusing and refreshing air. Harrison Ford, a veteran in acting, is absolutely convincing as Norman, following with amazing accuracy every turn of the plot. However, the most outstanding performance in the film is that of Michelle Pfeiffer. She plays a physically and emotionally demanding part with admirable genuineness and devotion.The music completes the film in every way by being chilling, mysterious, dreamy or threatening, sometimes tense and sometimes gentle. Along with the realistic and haunting sound effects creates the perfect atmosphere. As for the visual effects, although quite conventional, they still have the power to shock. Throughout the film, images become darker and darker as the camera follows the development of the story.
Director Robert Zemeckis set out to create the perfect thriller about the idea of the surface under which nothing is quite as it seems to be. He brought it off with incredible precision and dedication, by revealing the true nature of people. As the reflective surfaces bring truth to light, we realize that ""What lies beneath"" is not only an excellent thriller but a brilliant social satire too.Rating:5/5",What Lies Beneath
432,thejman10,Fire the director!,4,19 January 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Well, I really want to tell you that you should buy this movie, or see it (if you haven't already)... hmm. Ah, but I simply can't. There are so many lacks and cuts, stupid things happening without decent explanations, predictable scenes and a lot of poor distractions from the main story. Well, I wouldn't warn you down with all the bad features of that try-out film, but I can say a little what should have been in it and also some good things that were noticeable: First, a preparation for a good thriller is always the last scene; you begin with a flick of the ending without uncovering too many details and then you tell the story that lead to it. Second, lots of events should occur with some reality; a bloody half dead guy, that barely crawls, cannot make a distance of 20 meters without some noticable noise (unless he's unreal), a woman can't hold her breath above 4-5 minutes (unless she's some kind of an olympic athlete) and above all - recovering from a paralysing drug takes time (please!) and after being a while in cold-freezing water, you can barely move! and certainly not jump into a car ... well, in short, it's not realistic! Two good things you can say about this picture are that acting is great, done by an experienced couple of actors, who won't disappoint whatever the story is. Another good thing is casting Harrison as the bad guy - this is the only genius feature this picture had. Harrison Ford always plays the good guy, thus is a trusted figure, and that made it. Also Michelle's eyes also contribute to the scenery - she's a natural! In Summary, I'd give this picture a 4/10 for the few good things in it. The director should be more thorough...",What Lies Beneath

The breathtaking scenic backdrop, the beautiful house, the attractive couple, the normalcy of the daughter going off to college, and the family dog, all lend themselves to lulling the audience into a false sense of warmth and comfort. The jarring ""red herrings"" are part of the formula and balance the normalcy. This type of ebb and flow keeps the audience just enough off balance to cause discomfort and build the suspense. And, creating a selection of situations that may explain the creepy happenings is all part of the puzzle - and fun. I thought ""What Lies Beneath"" accomplished all of this. I do agree that too much advertising tends to take the edge off even the best plotted film. I don't think, ""The Uninvited"" would have been as effective had I seen repeated ads prior to viewing it, and that is part of what is wrong with modern films.",What Lies Beneath

I recommend waiting till it comes out on video so you can fast forward past the many uninteresting and unnecessary filler scenes.  By the time the tension actually increases, you may find yourself waaaay past caring.***SPOILERS***
Michelle Pfeiffer gave a good and varied performance (much better than in 'Wolf'), in contrast to Harrison Ford's humdrum husband.  Which is interesting, since 'Norman' was supposed to be a 'brilliant' scientist.  He did nothing in the film to even be considered 'bright', IMO.  He seemed very tranquilized (yawn) until the ""hahahahaha, I'm a killer and you're next"" bit.  I'll take Anthony Perkins or even Vince Vaughn's 'Norman' any day of the week compared to this passive loser.The film wasn't awful, but several things made me chuckle out of sheer disbelief.  The first time Claire sees the ghost in the bathtub, before Norman runs in after her scream, it takes what, 5 seconds for the whole tub to drain! Then, later, it takes forever for the water to drain past her nose when her magic toes pull up the plug.  And what faucet do you know that will cut 80% of the water supply after only a quarter turn? It wouldn't have been as laughable if the ghost had been involved, but this was not even hinted at . . . and the cliche's continued . . .

I found it confusing and amusing.  Did the ghost really appear in the bathroom scene or was that just Norman's imagination?  Claire calls her neighbor a murderer and he and his wife just laugh it off?  Who walks down a flight of stairs backwards?  How can a man crack his skull open on a sink and then run down a speeding truck?  How can a woman be paralyzed by drugs one minute and then be running through the house the next?  I realize suspending reality is needed in a movie like this, but come on!!!! The only believable and compelling character in this movie was Cooper the dog.My wife and I were trying to decide between this and Scary Movie.  I guess we chose Stupid Movie.  If you haven't seen What Lies Beneath, keep it that way.",What Lies Beneath
454,marc_kinsey,"Excellent film, bad finale.",8,17 November 2000,"I found 'What Lies Beneath' to be a thoroughly entertaining thriller. Pfeiffer is excellent, finally choosing a role that doesn't involve romance or comedy and Ford is very nearly bearable in a difficult part. However, the final 10 minutes were so contrived that I found myself shouting at the screen in disgust. Why, Hollywood, why? A terrible spoiling of a thoroughly enjoyable film in my view.",What Lies Beneath

456,luvthat88,Not worth the $2.95 rental fee,1,26 February 2001,"This movie was a complete and utter waste of my time.  The movie was twice as long as it needed to be, the silence that some speak of as a plus was actually sleep-inducing.  Some characters were totally unnecessary.  Jody for example, wasn't needed at all, except to spew cliches and slang terms that were about 20 years outside of her expected vocabulary.  A middle aged woman should not attempt to sound like a teenager.  it was nice to see Christina from Mommie Dearest acting again. Way to space out the movies there, think maybe there's a reason she hasn't been in a hit movie since Extremities?Outside of that, the movie was totally predictable, and the plot was un-original, copied from about 100 other ""ghost"" movies.

458,cude,Looks really nice,8,8 May 2001,"Michelle Pfeiffer has been one of my favorite actresses.  This is not because she is able to play those really serious dramas so that she can say a thousand words with one expression or she can yell really loud like Jack Nicholson, its because her acting is so natural, she never looks like she has to force anything.I thought she was extremely effective in this movie because we were able to feel what she was feeling, she was really scared - so was I.  I'll try not to give away any spoilers, but all I can say is that Harrison Ford was also perfect as the perfect husband.....One other noticeably positive thing about this movie was it looked really good, with the bluish tones - beneath the water and all.  This is your classic ghost in the new house thriller, only better than most in this category.  I'm always a sucker for ghost movies, especially good looking ones.Also, the pace of the movie was good.  It builds up just right, you won't see anything too erratic.(4/5)",What Lies Beneath

Now that those people have gone away, I can share. This movie had flashes of being interesting, mostly after only the one-hour mark was past. This marathon of cheesy shocks and roundabout revelations felt like a Tales from the Crypt episode stretched out to movie length; seeing Zemeckis' name at the end made some things click into place.The title was the best piece of writing in the film. Michelle Pfeiffer gave some good performances, but her character was such that Diane Scarwid stole a scene from her.I have to suggest some kind of numerical index indicating how much time one should let pass after watching an M.

Maybe I will lie to Block Buster Video and say that the DVD was horribly scratched so that I can get my 5 bucks back. I was too generous in giving it a 4 out of 10 stars, I guess it did HAVE potential, briefly that is.This is your typical bad ""horror"" movie, complete with a lame plot, super obvious foreshadowing, and everyone's favorite, the last and most crucial moments of the film seem to be completely thrown together on the fly. (Had me cussing at the characters! Yep, it's that bad!)Such disappointment is challenging to put to words. The movie is not scary, it seems scattered, tends to drag on, and like I said earlier, typical horror movie plot, meaning, you will see people do the most retarded and illogical stuff, completely opposite of how any non-mentally challenged person would react!I guess what I am trying to say here is, if you liked Jurassic Park 3, you will LOVE this movie!",What Lies Beneath

The kind of movie were the husband remains the pants in the family and tries everything he can in his power to keep the brains of his wife in one place. HOW ORIGINAL!

And some of the camera shots are awe-inspiring. Making you go ""How'd they do that, that was awesome"".  Acting by Pfiefer is superb as well. Her eyes do so much in this movie.Harrison Ford doesn't have alot to do in this movie, and I'm sure was cast so as to gain a likeability to his character immediately.  An unknown or someone who has played a bad guy before could not have been used, as they would not have been trusted for so long.While I admit I was creeped out at points, I found it so completely devoid of actual, real, suspense.  It used silence very well, but I think because it knew it needed it's loud jolts of sound to frighten, because nothing else could.Also way to long, the ending being extremely drawn out, and just plain hoaky.

468,Ronando,I can't believe it got 6.7,1,9 January 2003,"SPOILER!!!!!! I find it hard to believe that some people actually liked this film, let alone actually think it was scary! I watched it two years ago, and it still rates as possibly the worst film of all time in my book (well, certainly one of them).The first half hour or 45 minutes of the film is all irrelevant, wonderfully summed up by one of the only good bits in the film, the hilarious scene where the neighbour mock-strangles his wife at the party. I understand the purpose of throwing us off the scent, but we would have to have been on the scent in the first place. A waste of time.After that, it gets even worse. Any good thriller should have you saying by the end... oh of course I knew it was him/her. Not this one. You walk out thinking, how the heck was I supposed to guess that it was the girl he butchered, seeing as I never knew he butchered a girl in the first place?The slogan describes him as the perfect husband who made 'one mistake'. Well, I'm sorry to get all preachy, but anyone who has an affair on his wife and then brutally murders the person with whom he had an affair so as to keep it all hush-hush is certainly not 'perfect'. If he had been a brilliant scientist and a loving husband, who accidentally created a new supervirus when trying to cure AIDS, then maybe I could get the slogan...And what's the story with the dead person coming alive in the water? There's the supernatural, willing suspension of disbelief and all that, but at that point any respect I had for the film was lost.The theory some of us developed is that there was a first scene entirely missing from the film, one that would have made sense of the entire thing, possibly where we would have been shown the affair or something. How else could it have been this bad?One final point: early on in the film, Ford goes away for the weekend on business, and yet miraculously reappears halfway through the weekend to comfort Pfeiffer for one scene, only to disappear again. Is this explained in the film (I couldn't follow what the heck was going on), or is this an amazing goof?My only regret is that there is no 0 rating I could have given it.

The true charm of this movie is that it does actually take a Hitchcock-like storyline, sets it in beautifully shot New England and gets it all across as poetry. This is, in my mind, the perfect film for an Autumn day. Though I saw it dubbed in German originally I still found it quite good. It's the beautifully shot scenes that stay with you the most, as you'll never quite look at eerie lake surfaces the same again.

It was better than any scary movie that I have seen in the past ten years.  My husband and I were complaining about how sore our hands were when we left (I kept squeezing his from fear and suspense).  Both actors did a superb job in this film.  I had heard from the critics that it was a typical ghost story ending, but I was totally surprised at the end results.

I give Ford credit for straying from type-cast for one of the first times in quite a while, and Pfeiffer really does give a good try, but with the writing what it is, there wasn't much they could do to rescue this. And before someone points out that in a movie with supernatural elements, not everything needs to be totally believable, I'm talking about the pieces that aren't related to the ghost story aspect (I actually didn't mind that).

The first half of the movie moved a little slowly, but it kept me interested, I didn't get bored by it. I admit that the development of most of the characters was a bit awkward, but the story was about Pfeiffer's character, and i think Zemeckis kept that in proper perspective. Ok, besides the good story, good acting, etc. what i found most interesting was the style the director used. I didn't even realize it was Zemeckis directing until the end credits, but looking back i can see his hand in every scene shot. The look of the Vermont town they were in, the feel of the house, framing of the shots, camera movement, everything. He seems to have used the same style evident in the Frightners. Moving towards the end of the movie, The overall style didn't change, but it did start to feel more like something Hitchcock would have done had he the technology. As for the ending, I think they ended it a lot better than they could have. It could have turned out extremely stupid, like the ending of The Abyss.

This movie could have benefited by having a few more scenes dropped and a few less cliches.,What Lies Beneath
501,JessiBear,Great grown-up thriller,10,1 August 2000,"This movie was a great grown-up thriller.  I am getting tired of teeny-bopper scary movies and this was definately not one of those.  It has suspense, twists and turns and a very unexpected ending.  If you like to be scared, this is the movie for you.

502,jannette,Mixing with the master,8,8 August 2000,"In ""What Lies Beneath"" director Robert Zemeckis brings Hitchcock to mind with no apologies. Without giving the plot away, Zemeckis reworks some scenes  from  ""Rear Window"" and ""Psycho"". At least  one character name seems deliberate enough, as well as a parental fixation. If this sounds vague, can't be helped.  I plan another viewing with my daughter this time to get her take. Just like a good book, one shouldn't expect all the answers after the first read. And ""What Lies Beneath"" is a good movie. I laughed  a couple of times but after I left the theater and got out into the daylight, I realized that it had been a nervous laugh.",What Lies Beneath

The actors did not disappoint... Michelle P was particularly good... and the plot unfolded swiftly and was sound.  At the same time, the slow pace of the action drew the viewer in, and allowed time to absorb the detail.The film was watchable, entertaining, scary... and even terrifying in one part... although I found myself praying 'no, please don't grab the shower curtain!'The next scene was just exasperating... wasn't there a mobile on the hall table? ...and ...why can't you find the right keys just when you really, really need them?  ...and reminded me of a worn out blonde joke.Thanks to this mis-placed bit of comedy, I left my fear at the cinema and went home happy.

It had a very creepy sense about it. I couldn't see the ending coming. All in All it was worth seeing.",What Lies Beneath
505,Davio,Awful,3,25 August 2000,"It's a classic plot, done recently as the much better _Stir of Echoes_.  A ghost tries to tell a mortal of its death in order to exact revenge on its murderers (Hamlet?).  It has a hard time getting the message across and we are scared as it shows up and then goes away until finally it tells its story and is avenged by the mortal.  Only one problem with this version: The move was not scary, merely startling.Every time the ghost or bad guy shows up, the music cuts in abruptly and a shriek of violins punctuates the moment. People end up staring right a the camera from close up who we would have heard enter the room. There isn't one second on film that actually scares the audience. Instead, they are shocked over and over again. It's the difference between ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" and your typical camp fire startler.The plot itself is weak. The audience is psychologically manipulated down blind alley after blind alley until we don't believe what we see anymore. Some details are so obviously planted earlier for use later that it's almost laughably clumsy. Other times, the laws of physics are blatantly suspended for the benefit of some sort of weak cliff hanger.All of this is a shame given the cast and high production value.  The person who consulted for this film clearly had a grasp of the academic scientific world, and the setting is classic New England. It's just a pity that you have to suspend disbelief to such an extreme extent to find this movie enjoyable.",What Lies Beneath
506,FORBiDDENfruitOX,I loved the movie!,10,10 September 2000,This movie was such a thrill to watch. The music added to the effect. The music keyed something was going to happen so it made it all the scarier. Michelle Pfieffer acted so well in this movie. She played the role magnificently. I felt as if I were there the whole time. My favorite scenes are the bathtub scene and the lake scene. Harrison Ford plays his part pretty well even though I am used to seeing him as a good guy. The movie could be predictable at times... but it was SO good. I have seen it four times in theater and plan to see it at least one more time in theater. I can't wait until it comes out in December. Anyways --- I give it a 10/10!,What Lies Beneath

The first and most important thing is that there were no music in the first scenes. First you will say: ""What, a movie without music in the first part?"", but then you see what an effect this takes.

The movie had a nice eery touch, very well done, but don't you just hate it when everything goes suspiciously quiet and you *know* that you're only seconds away from an explosion of sound and a sudden movement, just there to make you jump up from your seat? In this kind of movie such starting effect can be functional sometimes, but Zemeckis really overdoes it. By the time it could be functional you're so used to jump up from your seat that it doesn't work anymore and you just get annoyed. Bad heart? Don't watch the movie. Ford also disappointed me. When he tries to convince his wife that he's really a good boy, it's like he just got out of acting school. This is not a good part for him. Bad casting?",What Lies Beneath

First off, I totally didn't expect this movie to be all that great, but my friends insisted that I watch it.  I came out of the theatres so scared.  Not only was the plot good, but it also didn't have any of all that unnecessary gore like all the recent horror flicks.  the plot was so that it kept you interested, but didn't have to shock you to keep your attention, rather, it just used suspense.  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves suspense/thriller movies.",What Lies Beneath

The plot was a little predictable, although the predictable didn't happen. I don't want to give anything away, although when you sense something is going to happen it usually does, although not exactly what you were expecting. This may sound like rubbish, although you know what i mean when you see it. (and you should see it on the big screen)The special effects were not required, this was a pure jump out of you seat type movie and not a computer game. The story has sort of been told before, although I do believe that this is one of the better versions.One thing I will say is that Michelle Pfeiffer can certainly act with her eyes!

Her face expressions are swell and so are Harrison's, although as far as i can remember this was the first time that he was the bad guy. When i was at the cinema i was so scared that i couldn't move because we really get into the story of this movie, and there's a point of the movie that we don't who's who and what's what. This move for me was without of doubt one of the best that I've seen, but it has it's fault's for instance the scene that she's at the bath tub and he faints and when finally she can get out of the tub and when she looks at the floor and he's not there, i mean hello what idiot wouldn't remember to check out if she wasn't dead. That's the only big problem in the movie. That scene could've become a ""classic"", the effects are fantastic and the editing it's so... so... just incredible, i mean we're talking about Robert Zemecks, he has made fantastic movies during his career, from Death Becomes Her to everybody's favorite Contact.

What Lies Beneath is about a woman named Claire Spencer who discovers that a ghost lives in her bathroom who has a big secret to tell. Claire decides that she wants to know what this secret is, so, she sets off finding clues about this girls mysterious death. But Claire, along the way, is having trouble with her husband, Norman Spencer (played by Harrison Ford) who seems to be acting strangely lately. Then after she finds all these clues (a necklace, this weird code and more) she discovers slowly that *gasp* her own husband did it! I'm not going to say why, you'll have to watch the movie for that.

526,mcmamas,This is such a great movie!!,10,2 January 2009,"Depending on the viewer, ""What Lies Beneath"" can be classified as either a thriller, or as a drama with elements of a thriller. I am going to go with the latter, as Director Robert Zemekis refrains from using the stuff of slasher flicks and horror films, and instead opts for tearing down our innate human hope that ""everything will turn out OK in the end"" through silence and dishonesty . This is a film that keeps you pinned to the T.V. set with its crescendo building suspense and interesting and mysterious characters.Dr. Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford) and his wife Claire Spencer (Michelle Pfeiffer), a seemingly happily married couple, have some adjusting to do after their only daughter leaves for college one late summer morning. Their secluded New-England style home set in the midst of the greens and lakes of Vermont seems the perfect retreat for Claire, who, it is evident, has been suffering from a bout of empty-nest syndrome since her daughter's recent departure. This seemingly perfect sanctuary however is itself the ironic twist of the story, for as soon as Claire is given a chance to embrace its warmth by herself, its warmth is  well- gone. With Norman, her accomplished geneticist husband, working all day in the lab and preparing for an upcoming conference, Claire begins to find her life in solitude eerie. Slowly but surely Claire begins to witness strange things inside of what should be the safest place around. Doors begin opening without anyone's touch, radios start blaring without a soul in sight, pictures perfectly centered on tables falling to the ground, and the bathtub is always full and yet no one is bathing. I know, I know, it sounds crazy, maybe even a bit giggle worthy, but it's not at all like that. Pair these events with the soft, eerie classical scores playing in the background, dark walls and rooms with only small candles for light, and Michelle Pfeiffer's watery eyes and genuinely concerned-looking pout, and you'll have yourself some loud and fast heartbeats. The thing is however, many will jump to classify this film as a horror picture, when in reality there are no knives, massacres, or weird creatures, just a woman alone dealing with some strange stuff. Claire tells Norman of the unnatural occurrences, first casually and almost in an amused kind of way, and eventually with a voice full of fear and worry and eyes full of tears when they continue to occur. The audience will see the empathy Ford's character feels for his wife from the start. He is always consoling her, reminding her that it's OK to be sad that her daughter left. After some time however, he begins to think that she is not mentally well and sends her to a psychiatrist when she continues to speak of ghosts and voices. The audience too will begin to wonder if Kaitlin's exit from home combined with her newfound loneliness has thrust Claire into lunacy. The audience will wonder lots of things in ""What Lies Beneath"", trying to get to the bottom of it all. In the end, ""What Lies Beneath"" is a film about a woman, her husband, and their home, with all its unsettling secrets. This movie will leave you guessing for a long while and I won't elaborate much more as to preserve its shocking and chilling finale, but I will say that this is a masterpiece; a film definitely worth seeing.""What Lies Beneath"" has some Hitchcock references, some red herrings, and plenty of foreshadowing. Re-watching this movie, I was able to pick up little clues as to what is really going on in the Spencer household. Director Robert Zemeckis perfectly cast Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in their roles, as they mold their characters into ones who win our empathy from the start. Pfeiffer always looks worried and frail, full of curiosity and naivety, while Ford always depicts immense concern and love for his wife, with a touch of sarcasm to his few words. Pfeiffer is in every scene of the film, and carries the film on her not-so-strong shoulders. Ford has little to do for the first half of the film except console and support his wife, but come the shuddering second half, he will be around lots more. This is a different kind of role for Ford, but he plays his role so wonderfully, you will hope he chooses more roles like this in the future. His performance is flawless! Ford and Pfeiffer have stellar chemistry; their connection works and it adds to the appeal of the film.Zemeckis prefers long-shots so that the audience might pick up clues as to what is going on in this house through the elaborate and beautiful scenery, but includes close-ups to show the audience how the characters are feeling during intense scenes. The dialogue is kept to a minimum, letting facial expressions narrate the story for a more emotional and compelling effect. Zemeckis also plays around with different camera angles, especially towards the end of the film. He switches from low angle shots to high angle shots depending on who has the greater point or voice in a particular scene. He also sticks with low-key angles, adding to the suspense of the picture.""What Lies Beneath"" is wonderfully crafted; a delight of a picture. It teaches, above all else, not to stray too far from home in all respects of the saying. Watch this movie because you will love it! It gets an A+!!",What Lies Beneath
527,bananas-r-cool,"Forbidden fruit, Spencer! (May contain spoilers)",1,26 May 2009,"Throughout the film there are loose ends and unexplained story lines that are never revisited. Though the film has it's tense moments it has nothing scary and one is left with a feeling of ""What the hell?"" This is what we remember from this film which we watched for the first time a few hours ago:. A neighbour, which the film spends the first hour showing as a murderer then abruptly drops and doesn't mention again. He is seen putting a body in a car and an explanation is never given. . An insane woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) who starts out as a promising (if slow moving) character which halfway through the film changes completely. One minute she is a normal woman, the next she is wearing a revealing red dress and taking an apple off her husband, declaring, ""Forbidden fruit, Spencer"" She later contradicts herself by forcing the apple into Norman's mouth and then biting his face. She then sees herself in the mirror dressed in black in the rain. She him to the desk. None of this behaviour is explained. She is also seen randomly flailing a phone at Norman and using it to defend herself when things turn violent. To add to this all, she seems to enjoy a dip in the lake, stealing missing children's hair from their homes and then later burning it and she seems to associate the ghost with herself, saying, ""the ghost looked like me but with green eyes!"" . Norman. Norman's character also changes throughout the film. He starts out as a normal, loving husband then transforms into a insane killer. Although this is the main storyline of the film, it is not mentioned until about an hour in. . Ghost woman. (We think?) Apparently murdered by Norman, but hard to tell as he lies so much. She occasionally pops up at random moments in the film and fills the bath with water. One can imagine Michelle Pfeiffer thinking to herself after about the third time of this occurrence ""Gosh darn it,the ghost has filled the bath again."" Later, we can only assume she somehow possesses Michelle Pfeiffer's character when she suddenly sits up in the bath having turned into a blue zombie lady. Later, the ghost woman's dead body comes back to life a few times to take revenge on Norman, once again unexplained.Overall, it is not worth watching and it will only leave you confused, disorientated and angry that you wasted 130 minutes of your precious life on this.",What Lies Beneath

You don't see much Violence, blood, killings on this movie, half of the movie is silence, absolutely no talking at all and I think that's what make this movie so special.If you like Ghost movies without much blood scenes and killings (Like the movie ""The Others"") yet a movie that can really frighten you and keep you on the edge of your seat... and then this movies is for you.

As if all mystery and thriller effects wanted to be involved throughout the whole movie, which resulted then, a kind of ZAZ production, with the lack of humor of course! Phases of the movie are keeping you busy for some time, then you understand it has no meaning or importance at all to the movie. Self opening front door, self going on/off stereo set and PC, photo frame on the desk etc. make no difference to the ongoing story, they are just for increasing the tension.

Of course there are some hints at some Hitchcock movies (chase scene, bathscene and music) but that is only great. It may not be the most original picture but it is entertaining and that is what moviemaking is all about (at least I think so).The actors perform great and the setting is beautiful (Vermont).

If so what does the voice say because it almost sound like it says the name Caitlin. Also I would like to comment on on Harrison Ford's role in the movie. To me he just was not very clear in how he was projecting his voice in the movie because he was really mumbling a lot. I thought he did a pretty good job acting more ""alive"" at the end when he trying to kill Claire. Does any body else agree? Please let me know.
