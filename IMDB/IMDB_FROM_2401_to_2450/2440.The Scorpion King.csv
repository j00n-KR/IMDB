0,Leofwine_draca,Average family-friendly action adventure,5,11 December 2016,"For a film that's the prequel of a sequel to a remake, you can hardly go in expecting cinematic gold. Maybe a little fun and plenty of action, if you're lucky. Thankfully, that's exactly what I got when I sat down to watch this, the offspring of THE MUMMY RETURNS, set in the ancient Middle East and detailing a strongman's rebellion against an enemy army. On the face of it, THE SCORPION KING is another in a long line of sword-and-sandal epics, bearing a superficial resemblance to the Steve Reeves-starrers of the '50s and '60s, but at heart this is a cheesy romp more in line with '80s offerings like CONAN THE DESTROYER. It doesn't care much about plot, originality, or authenticity: it's a kid's film designed to entertain, and that's exactly what it does.Now, I'm not a big fan of these movies. The Rock's first line is 'Boo' and we're immediately into muck-about action of the kind made popular in the two '90s TV shows, HERCULES: THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS. Then the wah-wah guitar music starts, and I was reminded unfavourably of KULL THE CONQUEROR, a film very similar to this except that it had a much smaller budget. Still, as I watched, I realised something: this wasn't actually too bad. A lot of the goodwill I was feeling comes from the presence of The Rock, here in his first leading role; he has an immense likability to him, and the ability not to take himself too seriously, just as Schwarzenegger was in the '80s. Okay, so he's no great shakes as an actor, but his physicality fills the screen and he adds a lot of energy to what plays out.The rest of the film is so-so. The plot is average, and quickly becomes formulaic: escape from these guys here, chase there, recaptured here, a fight scene there, then a lead-up to the ending. The supporting cast is also utterly predictable: ruffian children tagging along; an Asian-looking sorceress (Kelly Hu acquits herself better than Tia Carrera in KULL THE CONQUEROR, but only just); a tough, handsome bad guy (forgettable Scotsman Steven Brand); an eccentric Bernard Hill (also starring in the excellent LORD OF THE RINGS movies around this time) and Michael Clarke Duncan, the only person who could conceivably give The Rock an ass-whupping; needless to say, the extended bout between the two is a highlight. The action is passable without being inspiring or well choreographed, but the budget – clearly lower than usual – is put to good use, especially for the explosive climax. Director Chuck Russell made one of my favourite B-movies, the '80s BLOB remake, but his creativity doesn't make much of an impact here. Still, I liked The Rock and the short running time meant I didn't get bored, so THE SCORPION KING must have something going for it.",The Scorpion King
1,SnoopyStyle,The Rock Rises,6,20 October 2013,"Mathayus (Dwayne Johnson) seeks revenge against the tyrannical King Memnon (Steven Brand) for his brother. The King has swept aside his foes with a powerful virginal sorceress (Kelly Hu). Mathayus with the help of thief Arpid (Grant Heslov), the captured sorceress, the alchemist Philos (Bernard Hill), and a tribe leader Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan), he will take down Memnon once and for all.This is an ancient prequel to The Mummy series. It's all about Dwayne The Rock Johnson. His physique, his power, and his charm are the driving force of this movie. He's the sole reason anybody should want to see this movie. The plot is forgettable. His action is grand but it's his charm that make any of this watchable. He's more than a stunt person or a meathead wrestler. This marks his first leading role in a big movie.",The Scorpion King
2,jboothmillard,The Scorpion King,4,28 November 2011,"From director Chuck Russell (The Mask, Eraser), this was the immediate spin off film made straight after The Mummy Returns, the film that introduced us to the title character, I suppose this one I had to watch as well. Basically, set in the days of the ancient Egyptians and pyramids, Memnon (Steven Brand) is the evil king who uses The Sorceress (X-Men 2's Kelly Hu) with her psychic powers to foretell his victories and take over the empire. The leaders of the free world have one last hope for freedom of the kingdom and to stop Memnon from taking over the world, that is sending mercenary assassin Mathayus (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) to kill the Sorceress and foil his plans. Meeting the Sorceress however Mathayus changed his plan and instead kidnaps her to make bargains or whatever, and he has trickster Arpid (True Lies actor Grant Heslov) and tribal leader Balthazar (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan) tagging along too. Obviously there are obstacles along the way, chases, battles and traps, but in the end Mathayus does manage to defeat the villain in the end, and fulfil his destiny becoming The Scorpion King. Also starring Bernard Hill as Philos, Peter Facinelli as Prince Takmet and Roger Rees as King Pheron. Johnson is fine as the lead character, and it is alright to see the character from The Mummy Returns good for the whole film, not just in the opening and later becoming a giant scorpion monster, the supporting cast are fine too, the story though could be a little bit fresher and original, it is almost same old same, cheesy and an only reasonably fun to watch action adventure fantasy. Okay!",The Scorpion King
3,Tweekums,Silly but fun action in Ancient Egypt,7,5 October 2016,"The film 'The Mummy Returns' introduced the character of The Scorpion King as the main villain with a brief flashback to his original rise to power and his later fall thousands of years before; this film gives us more details of his rise to power when he was still very much the 'good guy'.At the start Mathayus, the man destined to become the Scorpion King, is hired to assassinate the sorceress who is enabling the evil Memnon to conquer that part of the world he also has a personal motive; Memnon killed his brother and he wants revenge. Things don't go according to plan and he ends up fleeing from Memnon along with his sorceress and Arpid, a horse thief, who had helped him. Mathayus must fight off many of Memnon's men and although he prevails he is stabbed by an arrow dipped in scorpion venom. The sorceress manages to save him but cautions that he will always have scorpion blood. Following a vision that shows Mathayus's death the sorceress returns to Memnon's palace. Soon afterwards Mathayus and his allies get there too and the inevitable final confrontation occurs.This film may not be a classic; much of it is fairly ridiculous but it was a lot more fun than I expected. The story is decent enough and serves to provide plenty of action; this is done in an exciting rather than gory manner of the sort that is probably suitable for older children. There are also a good number of laughs to be had. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson isn't the best actor but he does have a presence as Mathayus and the role hardly calls for a great thespian. Steven Brand is okay as bad guy Memnon but is a bit bland. The supporting cast are perfectly serviceable; Grant Heslov provides a good number of laughs as Arpid and Kelly Hu is solid as the sorceress even if her character seems to be a copy of Solitaire from 'Live and Let Die' and her costume, what there is of it, is clearly designed to catch the eye of male viewers something it does successfully! Overall I'd say this is worth watching if you want a cheesy action movie with little to offend if you aren't bothered by the fairly bloodless violence.",The Scorpion King
4,ma-cortes,"Rousing adventure set in an ancient time , thousands of years before the Pyramids , a tyrant rules and ¨The Rock¨ exacts a relentless vengeance against him",6,16 July 2020,"Nice first installment in The Scorpion King saga with lots of action , fights , sword-play and necromancy . Set five thousand years ago , predating the pyramids , in ancient Gomorrah . A desert warrior named Mathayus (Dwayne Johnson ,The Rock, who is the title star) rises up against the evil army commanded by Memnon (Steven Brand) that is destroying his homeland by convoking dark forces and using the psychic powers of his sorceress Cassandra (Kelli Hu) to fortell his great victories . The remaining free nomadic tribes are forced to form an uneasy alliance to put an end to mighty and tyrannical King Memnon , along with his underling as Takmet (Peter Facinelli), whose reign is full of evilness . Mathayus uses all his strength and cunning to outwit a formidable opponent who will stop at nothing to unlock a supreme ancient power helped by a bizarre witch . Then Malthayus captures the enemy's key sorceress , takes her deep into the desert and prepares for a final showdown . As Mathayus assisted by his motley allied group (Grant Heslov , Bernard Hill) has to rescue his lover from the claws of the feared Memnon who kidnapped her , resulting in Mathayus ends up getting much more than he bargained for . Now, with the help of his new powerful allies, including bouncing warriors as Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan) , Mathayus returns to the legendary city to infiltrate Memnon's impenetrable fortress in the desert and exact his vendetta supported by unexpected and resourceful allied people . It's up to Mathayus to fufill his destiny and become the great Scorpion King. Warrior. Legend. King.This over-the-top actioner is more in the ¨Sword and Witchery¨ vein than a historical film . Yes it's cheesy at times , but it doesn't actually strive for any more . In the wake of WWF fashion , the action here is relentless and unstoppable and in which a hunk hero fights mercilessly , only to find himself up against a seemingly indestructible evil army , and , ultimately , doing a last ditch effort to stop Memnon from taking over the world . In terms of milking a cash cow this blockbuster was made to make money and at the same time was a spin-off to ¨The Mummy¨ saga directed by Stephen Sommers , here as a co-producer . But it's mindlessly amusing and entertainment all the same , and doesn't take itself seriously . All the men have the usual requisite amount , showing muscles and strength , while the women are all scantly clad . The main motivation behind the whole endeavour seems to be to make Dwayne Johnson , a movie star , and it was really achieved , as The Rock plays competently Mathayus , one of the few survivors and the last of the Akkadians, the brave assassin destined to be the next Scorpion King, as the leaders of the remaining free tribes hire him for an impossible task of executing , being entrusted to murder a villain king . Accompanied by the gorgeous Kelli Hu as the fortune-telling sorceress Cassandra , the always sympathetic Grant Heslov as trickster Arpid , Bernard Hill who was the famous captain of the Titanic picture and the early deceased Michael Clarke Duncan as the giant tribe leader. While the extremely evil Steve Brand plays a generalissimo who has bloodily seized the throne and demands cruel proof of blind loyalty . The picture was professionally directed by Chuck Russell who keeps matters rollicking , but it's wall to wall hokum nevertheless .This thrilling Scorpion King saga is formed by the first and best¨Scorpion King¨ 2002 by Stephen Sommers with The Rock , Dwayne Johnson, Steven Brand , Kelli Hu , Grant Heslov , Bernard Hill , Michael Clarke Duncan .

5,Quinoa1984,"Amusing in it's action, horrible in it's acting, a bit of a below par B-movie",6,22 April 2002,"The Scorpion King stars the Rock, the wrestler (real name Dwayne Johnson doesn't appear around the credits part, pay it no mind), takes on the spin off movie of his character from the Mummy 2.  Here, he shows his acting skills are formidable (er, pretty uninspired and lame) for a action movie of this sort.  And by this sort I mean where the action is non-stop until the point when you give up and give in to the amusing aspects of the action scenes- like when the Rock gets thrown into a room full of women in one fight scene (I'm not making this up) and then is surrounded by cooing ladies and what does the Rock do, he gives the People's eyebrow.  This is also back when that was the past time I take it.  Only die hard fans of Johnson, or those looking depserately for a exciting movie, should vide this, those not interested in the first place should steer clear.  B-",The Scorpion King

Dwayne(The Rock)Johnson is a warrior chosen assassin exhausting his efforts to trounce an evil conqueror(Steven Brand). The intense action takes your mind off of the hackneyed plot.

7,CinemaSerf,A scorpion without much sting....,5,7 December 2019,"Spawned from the ""Mummy Returns"" this rather stolid and lurching drama tells the tale of Mathayus (Dwayne Johnson) an Akkadian - an ancient sort of Mesopotamian - who tries to overthrow the tyrant King Memnon (Steven Brand) who reigns with the aid of sorceress who can predict the future (Kelly Hu). This is as formulaic as I've seen in this genre and leaves little for the imagination. It has humour, on occasion, but is anything but subtle. It's all just a vehicle for the star with little else to recommend it to anyone.",The Scorpion King

As Mathayus  a highly skilled assassin on a quest for vengeance against evil tyrant Memnon (Steven Brand)  he sort of looks like he does in the ring. But he whips ass with flair and exhibits a mercury-quick wit. A few love scenes, but mostly smack downs.The Rock has proved his ability to do a fairly good job.

9,zardoz-13,"Poor Man's ""Conan""",3,9 July 2007,"Nobody enjoys schlocky sword & sorcery cinematic sagas more than me. Growing up in the 1960s, I watched as well as enjoyed my share of those predictable but entertaining Italian-produced peplum masterpieces with Steve Reeves, Gordon Scott, and Dan Vadis staged against the breathtaking Roman scenery at the famous Cinecittà Studios. Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Atlas, and the endless sons of Hercules toppled larger-than-life adversaries in a succession of bicep-bulging, jaw-clenching, sword-slashing battles when they didn't pause to utter absurd dialogue in atrociously dubbed English. The treacherous toga-clad villains exuded malevolent evil. Whenever they thought they had thwarted the indestructible hero, these morally depraved miscreants would rear their heads back and cut loose with gales of maniacal laughter. Typically, these testosterone-laced tales featured brawny champions out to rescue some curvaceous damsel-in-distress from disaster. Often, monstrous predators menaced our mythical protagonists and those monsters were sometimes men in rubber suits! Sadly, the new stud-muffin, muscle-rippling melodrama ""The Scorpion King"" doesn't live up to its lowbrow, sword & sorcery heritage. Despite the formidable presence of WWF Wrestling superstar Dwayne Johnson, a.k.a. 'the Rock,' this pedestrian, PG-13 rated, cliffhanger set 5000 years ago in 'the time before the Pyramids"" lacks the savage ferocity of Arnold Schwarzenegger's two ""Conan"" chronicles, but surpasses the woebegone Kevin Sorbo opus ""Kull the Conqueror"" (1997). Long on sword play but shy on sorcery, this uninspired Chuck Russell-directed actioneer provides ample action packed footage of the Rock but very few surprises in its tedious plot. First, the chief villain poses little threat to our dynamic hero. Second, since he perished at the beginning of ""The Mummy Returns,"" the Rock cannot die, exacting a deadly toll on the film's suspense.Cast as Mathayus, last of the Akkadians, the Rock plays an assassin from a legendary tribe ""trained for generations in the deadly arts."" Several oppressed tribes band together and hire him to slay the ruthless Memnon (Scotland's Steven Brand of ""Treasure Raiders""), a dreary Attila the Hun wannabe who depends on a sexy Cassandra-like sorceress (Hawaiian beauty Kelly Hu of ""Underclassman"") to forecast the future. As villains go, Memnon talks rough enough but lacks sting. A tribal turncoat (Peter Facinelli of ""Can't Hardly Wait"") sells Mathayus' ill-fated brother before his eyes. Nevertheless, resourceful Mathayus manages to escape, abducts the sorceress, and tries to lure Memnon away from the safety of his fortress.Incredibly, three writers toiled on this feeble-minded, formulaic fodder that shamelessly recycles elements from ""Last of the Mohicans,"" the 007 thriller ""Die Another Day,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Flash Gordon,"" and ""The Mummy."" Scenarists Stephen (both ""Mummy"" flicks"") Sommers, William (""Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot"") Osborne, and David (""X-Men"") Hayter contrived this superficial but serviceable boy-gets-girl/boy-loses-girl fantasy from an original story by Sommers and Jonathan (""Star Wars, Episode 2: Attack of the Clones"") Hales. Wisely, Russell allows neither the loopholes in the half-baked script nor the conspicuous lack of logic cripple the film's headlong momentum. Russell is best known for directing the Arnold epic ""Eraser,"" which was a good little thriller. The Rock delivers a solid performance that consists primarily of postures more than personality. The Viking showdown scene, the fire-ants scene, and the arrow-in-the-back scene furnish the best moments in this disappointing, poor man's ""Conan the Barbarian.""",The Scorpion King
10,Boba_Fett1138,A decent action-movie/adventure flick. What else did you expect?,6,6 January 2006,"I think nobody expected this movie to be a masterpiece but people did expected this movie to be an entertaining action-flick, on par with the two The Mummy movies, of which this movie is a direct spin-off. The movie does not disappoint in its action, which makes ""The Scorpion King"" a far from great but still a certainly watchable movie.The Rock is no actor but he is a great action-hero star. Despite his flawed acting he is believable and likable in his role. The movie has a solid supporting cast. Steven Brand is a great villain actor and I expect more good villainous roles from him in the future. Michael Clarke Duncan is a welcome addition, even though the movie could had done without his character. It further more has well known actors Kelly Hu and Bernard Hill appearing in this movie.This is the sort of movie which I imaging would have been great for stunt performers to work on. The movie is action packed and filled with some nicely choreographed fighting sequences and other fine action sequences, including big explosions and all sorts of weapons. The action movie fan will not be disappointed with this movie and there is plenty for him or her to enjoy in this movie.Of course the story is almost non-existent but honestly what else did you expect? The story isn't really anything new and it rips off multiple movies without shame. The movie is not filled with any surprises but anyone who had expected a tight waterproof, original plot are apparently also not familiar with the two The Mummy movies, which also were far from perfect or original when it comes to the plot and story.Unfortunately director Chuck Russell isn't the most talented guy in the business, you can tell that by looking at this movie. His style feels inexperienced, even though he already had quite some experience as a director while shooting this movie.At what it tries to achieve, the movie is successful. It brings some good mindless, action-packed entertainment.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Scorpion King
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Just know what to expect,6,31 December 2009,"Not particularly enjoying either Mummy flick, one might think that I wasn't looking forward to this. It's actually the other way around; with Sommers out of the director's chair, there was hope for something good. And really, as long as you don't think that this is more than it is, you may enjoy it. Think of Conan. Yes, this is a sword-and-sorcery adventure picture. No, it's not that compelling of one, but it can be entertaining. If you wondered where the titular character of this came from, well, here is... uh... some of that story. They do say that the first step of any journey is the hardest, so perhaps it is fitting that this isn't that great of a movie. The Rock has zero charisma(he needs to assign experience points to that), and while there are one or two talented actors(Michael Clarke Duncan... why?) in this, there is no impressive performances. Steven Bland... sorry, Brand... makes a decent enough villain. The kids are nearly the worst of the bunch, second only to the never chuckle-worthy, always irritating comic relief(thankfully, he gets bashed in the head a few times). While I don't understand why they went for so much Jackie Chan(meaning, with props) martial arts, I gotta say, the fighting is pretty cool and can be exciting. Director Chuck Russell(of The Mask and Eraser) gets about all that he can out of the extremely clichéd script, and makes a film that can be fun, if you're in the mood for it. Also, it deserves mention that he, probably realizing that it wasn't going to turn out that excellent, peppered it with hot chicks, many of them showing off cleavage. My god, Kelly Hu spends what appears to the majority of her screen-time with her legs entirely uncovered(well, as close as she could possibly get without this losing its PG-13 rating)! There is sensuality and mild violence, as well as a bit of potentially disturbing content in this. I recommend this to any fan of this sub-genre. 6/10",The Scorpion King
12,Uriah43,A Family-Oriented Action Film,6,27 February 2019,"This film takes place in ancient times with a warrior king named ""Memnon"" (Steven Brand) leading his army from one victory to another with only a couple of small tribes left to confront him. It's then during a meeting of these tribes that an Akkadian assassin named ""Mathayus"" (Dwayne Johnson) steps forward and declares that the only way to stop Memnon from destroying them is to kill the sorceress named ""Cassandra"" (Kelly Hu) who gives him the information vital to his success on the battlefield. Eventually, they agree to hire Mathayus to kill Cassandra but subsequently discovers that this will be much more difficult than even he had planned. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I thought that this was a pretty good ""prequel"" to the movie ""The Mummy's Return"" which was produced a year earlier. I especially liked the performances of both Dwayne Johnson and Kelly Hu-the latter being absolutely gorgeous as well. Be that as it may, while I would have preferred some graphic special effects to accompany the combat scenes, I fully understand the decision to keep things more family-oriented to appeal to a larger audience. That criticism aside, however, it was still an enjoyable film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",The Scorpion King

But Mathayus ends up getting much more than he bargained for. Now with the help of the trickster Arpid, tribal leader Balthazar and an unexpected ally, it's up to Mathayus to fulfill his destiny and become the great Scorpion King.....A silly spin off of an even sillier movie, The Scorpian King is by the numbers Conan piffle, but it does show that Dwayne Johnson had very good screen presence, even though the script is dire.Russell is a good director, and knows how to handle a high concept movie, but here he loses the plot.....and then some.So what we are left with is Johnson and the great film writer Grant Heslov walking around the desert, bickering, having fights, bickering some more, and chasing after the cut price Sean Pertwee.There isn't any urgency in the movie, the set pieces are lethargic, and Kelly Hu's hair is always in the wrong place.It's the Fast and the Furious of sword and sandals movies, and it just plods on and on, until the predictable finale.If your a fan of Johnson, forget this, and start with The Rundown, at least it's fun.",The Scorpion King
14,gradyharp,Pure Fun Entertainment,7,5 December 2010,"THE SCORPION KING is one of those films to watch at the end of a day filled with thinking, doing, and preoccupation with stress. Pop it in the DVD slot and sit back and let the silly magic work. Dwayne Johnson is now an accepted member of the Hollywood start squad but here he is simply the wrestler The Rock and it is entertaining to see the promise the guy showed in this first starring role. Yes the gigantic build on the man is impressive (this was made in the days before he learned about definition as opposed to bulk) - he is matched by the presence of massive Michael Clarke Duncan and Ralf Moeller! - but the surprise comes in the way he delivers the corny lines he is given: the man has a comic bent, proved in later films but already present here. The story is pretty silly as one would expect from a 'committee team' product (Stephen Sommers, Jonathan Hales, William Osborne, and David Hayter), but that really matters very little. The fight sequences manage to be scary while being also funny, the colors of this ancient kingdom in the desert are beautiful, and the cast is peppered with some winsome people such as Kelly Hu, Grant Heslov, Steven Brand and Peter Facinelli. What makes this fast moving comic book-type epic work is the fact that it appears that everyone involved is having a great time with the material. Maybe that is why it is so fun to watch!

16,JamesHitchcock,Revives the lost art of the bad sword-and-sorcery epic,3,12 August 2008,"Once upon a time there were a Mr & Mrs Rock who decided to name their son ""The"". Having a definite article for a Christian name, however, proved no drawback to young The, and he went on to become a well-known wrestler, as well as an occasional actor. ""The Scorpion King"" is a spin-off from ""The Mummy Returns"", in which The played a relatively minor character called the Scorpion King. In the earlier film, however, this character was a villain, a tyrannical, power-crazed warlord; here he is a hero, a freedom fighter trying to overthrow a tyrannical, power-crazed warlord. The film does not have much in common with ""The Mummy Returns""; it bears a much closer resemblance to the sort of sword-and-sorcery epics that the current Governor of California was making in the early eighties.The film is supposedly set somewhere in the Middle East in the far-distant past, thousands of years before the Pyramids were built, although there are a number of anachronisms. The earliest Egyptian pyramids were built around 2,600 BC, but we see horsemen using stirrups, not invented until more than 2,000 years later. Gunpowder (said to be a secret formula from China) plays an important part in the plot; the Chinese did indeed invent gunpowder, but not until the time of the Tang dynasty, around 800 AD. There are characters with Greek names such as Philos and Cassandra, even though the supposed date of the film long antedates the rise of Greek culture. The basic idea is that civilisation as we know it, or as we knew it several millennia BC, is being threatened by the evil tyrant Memnon, who is set on conquering the entire world. Memnon is assisted in his conquests by a powerful Sorcerer who can foretell the future. Mathayus, a professional assassin, is hired by Memnon's enemies to kill the Sorcerer, but then discovers that she is actually an attractive young woman, certainly far too attractive to kill. Mathayus decides that his best plan of action is to fall in love with her, get her to fall in love with him and enlist her help in the battle against Memnon. (Was Mathayus a distant ancestor of James Bond? He has made use of a similar plan of action on numerous occasions). You can easily work out the rest of the story from here. The film is not quite as awful as some of the sword-and-sorcery films from the 1980s, but that is because of the advances in technology during the intervening period. The special effects are still fairly ropey, but they are not as hilariously bad as they were in something like ""Red Sonja"". The art of acting, however, has not advanced at all; The Rock is every bit as wooden as early-period Schwarzenegger. The beauteous Kelly Hu is rather better than the ghastly Brigitte Nielsen, who played the equivalent role in ""Red Sonja"", but then it would be difficult to be worse. Stephen Brand as Memnon is weak and Grant Heslov as the horse-thief Arpid who reluctantly becomes Mathayus's sidekick is simply annoying. Bernard Hill can be a very good actor, as he showed in ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Titanic"", so it was a disappointment to see him in sorry trash like this.The plot is no more than a succession of clichés and the dialogue is frequently ponderous and stilted. (Sample: ""May the gods have pity on you, for my brother will not""). Notwithstanding the success of Peter Jackson's brilliant ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""The Scorpion King"" proves that, even in the twenty-first century the art of making bad fantasy epics has not been lost. 3/10",The Scorpion King
17,=G=,Good butt kickin' fun.,6,4 October 2002,"""The Scorpion King"" tells of a desert assassin (the hero), his reluctant comic-relief buddy, his trusty camel, a luscioius sorceress,  a gigantus black warlord dude, an army of barbarous babes, cute theif/kid, and an old alchemist who take on a desert bastion to rid the kingdom of the people's scourge, a wicked king who catches arrows and probably picks on old ladies and kids too. No brainer action entertainment which you can leave to go get a beer without missing anything important except maybe ""The Rock's"" eyebrow thing, this flick is a fun not-to-be-taken-seriously diversion with a sense of humor worth a look by action junkies who aren't going to get all up tight and analytical.

20,FeastMode,my notes,1,25 June 2019,I watched parts of this again and it was very laughable. I originally watched it once when it first came out,The Scorpion King
21,bowmanblue,The Mummy's distant cousin (once removed),7,18 January 2015,"If you've watched 'The Mummy Returns' you may be aware that it was Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson's first on-screen role. His contribution to the film was hardly iconic, but it appeared to be career-defining enough to give him his own spin-off movie, 'The Scorpion King.' Ignoring the fact that he was a baddie in the Mummy Returns, he's now our hero. And for good reason – he's so damn lovable! It's hard not to root for him, even in a film that really isn't that good. Not that that applies to The Scorpion King. It's great fun. Hardly a classic, but just good fun. And, I'll wager that the demographic most likely to appreciate it would be young boys (or men like me who are still into sword and sorcery etc – I think that qualifies me as a 'geek'). I can see gangs of young lads crowding round the telly on a Saturday afternoon to watch the Rock beat countless faceless baddies to a pulp.You certainly don't need to have seen any of the Mummy movies to enjoy this. Although both films are definitely in the 'action/adventure' genre, they don't really feel alike. It's basically a 'stand-alone' movie which is only related to its predecessor by the one central character and it's more at home among the 'sword and sandals' films than with the Mummy trilogy.It has a very basic plot. Every scene is a set-up for the next and everything everyone says is an important plot point that will have some significance later on. The goodies are good and the baddies are very easy to spot. Sometimes a film uses the tool of having the hero and the villain constantly squaring off against each other, playing off each other. However, here we have possibly the most stereotypical villain ever. He shouts. He bawls. He wants to marry women who he knows hate him. He wants to conquer the world and has a habit of killing any of his men who displease him. He's not that great to be honest, but, seeing as it's The Rock's movie and not his, it doesn't really matter. He fills the 'villain' role.Besides the Rock's charm as a leading man, it's also worth mentioning his helpers. You have Kelly Hu as 'the Sorceress' who absolutely smoulders in her role and Grant Heslov as 'Arpid' who basically plays the part that John Hannah's played in the Mummy trilogy as the 'comic relief' of the film.Like I said, this isn't an amazing movie, but if you're looking for a 'family friendly' Conan-type action film that will keep the boys entertained on a west afternoon, then this is it (or you're just a big kid at heart!).",The Scorpion King
22,g-bodyl,So Bad......It's Good!,8,15 July 2013,"The Scorpion King, a prequel to the hit Mummy movies, is a really bad film with cheesy special effects, cringe-worthy dialog, and some lame acting. But I find it so bad, that it's actually a good, entertaining ""B"" film. It has some non-stop action and some of the action scenes were actually executed well. My only problem is I expected this film to tie in with 2001's The Mummy Returns and we will get to see how The Scorpion King turns into a villain, but alas it does not.Chuck Russell's film is about the origins of the Scorpion King who we met in The Mummy Returns. He is an Akkadian and a hero. He goes on a mission to kidnap a sorceress who is helping an evil king with all his conquests in order to stop his tyranny.The acting ranges from lame to decent. This is one of the earliest roles for Dwayne Johnson and he is pretty bad here. But thankfully, he improves vastly in later films. Bernard Hill was actually pretty good and Grant Heslov supplies some comic relief. However, I thought Steven Brand who played the evil king was ridiculously bad, way worse than The Rock.Overall, this is a fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. The movie seemed to know that it is bad and embraced it. I liked the action scenes and that one scene that involves red fire ants. I'm quite disappointed we didn't get to see how this movie ties in with the Mummy series. This is a good, summer blockbuster that does not require a thinking audience. I rate this film 8/10.",The Scorpion King
23,CuriosityKilledShawn,So he's...the bad guy?,7,24 October 2004,"Okay, I'm confused. The Mummy Returns portrays the Scorpion King as some evil tyrant who wants to take over the world by smiting any and all civilizations in his way. But that's exactly the opposite of the same character in his very own movie. In fact he struggles to overthrow an evil ruler for those very reasons.So when, and why, did he become bad? I'm afraid I'm not following this. The movie, however, is entertaining, if rather short and silly. Chuck Russell tries to cram in loads of fighting and hokum as he can. It works and The Rock is very cool as said King (or Mathayus) and former Jason victim Kelly Hu is gorgeous as the scantily-clad Cassandra. Grant Heslov and Michael Clarke Duncan fill out their usual roles as ethnic comic-relief and big, muscley guy.The film has slightly less integrity to it than the Mummy movies. This is evident with the fun and lively, but completely inappropriate, score by John Debney. I'm not expecting anything like his Passion of the Christ score but blaring death metal guitars seem kinda out of place in a movie set 3000 years BC.But this movie is a cheeseburger, not a 17-course dinner. So why bother complaining. After all it's a prequel of a sequel of a movie that was a re-make of a movie that was made in the 30's. But it's well made and loads of fun so just go along with it and you'll enjoy.Filmed in Panavision the DVD is in perfect 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with very loud and thrilling Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. The extras are fluff, but that's to be expected.",The Scorpion King

I'm a big fan of the Conan movies as well and to Me The Scorpion King isn't like them at all. The Scorpion King delivers all of the goods. Tons on nonstop action, a little humor, and great sets. The actors were good as well. The Rock did an excellent job for his first major motion picture and Michael Clarke Duncan looked more massive than ever before. His performance was great! The long fight between the huge men was awesome! Steven Brand was tremendous as Memnon. The way he performed made you believe he was the greatest fighter at the time. Ralph Moeller looked excellent and he did great as a villain. His accent was really cool. I was glad to see Grant Heslov make a good appearance and in fact I think he did just as good as he did in True Lies and Congo. Kelly Hu performed good. Branscombe Richmond, Bernard Hill, Peter Facinelli, Roger Rees, Al Leong, Gus Rethwisch, Peter Navy Tuiasosopo, and the legendary wrestler Tyler Mane all have brief roles which they all perform well. Great music by John Debney! Chuck Russell is a great and underrated director in My opinion and directs everything in this movie greatly especially the sword fights between Mathayus and Balthazar.

Perhaps a film for a certain audience but as a whole had little to no interest on where the film was heading.",The Scorpion King
27,filipemanuelneto,Too strange and imaginative to be taken seriously.,3,28 April 2016,"This film depicts essentially a civil war in which a group of warriors led by Mathayus will try to confront Memnon, an evil and ruthless king. The story seems to go up in Egypt before the time of the pharaohs, and seems to be slightly based on so-called ""Scorpion Pharaoh"", an obscure historical figure about which we know almost nothing. Directed by Chuck Russell, it has script by Stephen Sommers, the director who made ""The Mummy"" films, and which introduced in these films a hook for this one. The cast is led by Dwayne Johnson, the protagonist, and also has Steven Brand and Kelly Hu.This film resembles visually films like ""Mad Max"" or ""Conan the Barbarian"" and television series like ""Xena: Warrior Princess"". They are films that seem based on Antiquity, to some extent, and who seek to be war epics or, at least, adventure movies. Thus, this film brings very little new things. The hook made in ""The Mummy Returns"" for these movie resulted in a major continuity paradox because the hero of this movie, the Scorpion King, is depicted there as a powerful villain. The cast is regular and doesn't bring anything interesting. Kely Hu was apparently chosen only based on their appearance under clothing as Dwayne Johnson was selected for his ability to action roles. In fact, Johnson is far from the sensitivity and depth required for a more versatile actor. The scenarios are abundant in imagination just as the costumes, which seems to freely mix elements of ancient civilizations with other right out of comics or of any indie fashion studio.This movie could have been much better if it had been located properly in space and time. The problem with this film is the exaggerated imagination of the director and screenwriter. Everything has limits. The cast could also have been chosen better and the characters could have been built in a much more interesting way. Positive are the action scenes, using martial arts from Philippines about we never heard before, but that look good on the screen.",The Scorpion King

Personally, when I went to the cinema to see this movie, I expected the same cohesion of story that we got from the Mummy and the Mummy Returns. It wasn't there. Instead, we got some crap about the guy before he WAS the Scorpion King. We got nothing of the story to which the Mummy Returns eluded. I was bitterly disappointed, and in writing this, I realize I STILL am disappointed in this movie.I don't care if it was well done, or well enacted.

She drives the protagonist Mathayas against the antagonist Memnon who've kept her in captivity by force since her childhood. With her will and courage she over comes the enemy and brings peace and harmony to now developing Egypt. Kelly Hu is gorgeous in this movie and I just couldn't get enough of her playing Cassandra.

In that aim it more or less succeeds... assuming your expectations are right.Led by the always charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, 'The Scorpion King' is an inoffensive sword and sorcery flick in the grand B-movie tradition of 'Conan The Barbarian', but shackled by political correctness, it hedges its bets on the sex and violence that made the latter special.

After capturing Memnon's sorceress, Mathayaus hunts Memnon down and attempts to overthrow his regime...Having seen both the Mummy and The Mummy Returns I kind of had an idea of what to expect from this instalment...or at least I thought I did...Whilst the first two films had a goofy charm to them (in a kind of Indiana Jones type way) this prequel doesn't seem to quite deliver in the same manner.Yes it has some laughs and yes some of the goofy charm is present, but yet somehow it still manages to be less fun than the first two films. For a start, it lacks the fun adventure type nature that the first two films offered and unfortunately this is where this film comes up short. The story is weak and unfortunately it does rely on weak attempts at humour (one glaring example is the section where Dwayne Johnson hides behind the big gong and then crashes through the window which has clearly been ripped off from the start of Indiana Jones and the temple of doom). I never found that I cared for the story nor for that matter anyone that was in the film.The only people who made any impact on this picture were Dwayne Johnson and Michael Clarke Duncan. Both of these big fellas play off each other fairly well and they both put in decent performances. Steven Brand (or is it Steven Bland) isn't a particularly compelling villain and Kelly Hu (who is pretty much flawlessly beautiful) doesn't put in much of an acting performance which drags the film down somewhat. Grant Heslov is there in a comedic relief role which does serve the film well in all honesty.There are parts of this film that work and it does have some of the goofy charm of the first film. but the problem with this film is that the story is weak and isn't particularly compelling.

But then again, isn't this what people expect nowadays. Such mindlessness leaves little to the imagination, and its clear, little imagination was put into this story due to the 92-minute run time. I will state this though, at least the audience wasn't exposed to pitiful special effects like the two Mummy films.

38,Spleen,"Aargh! The badness! The horrible, palpable badness!",3,10 August 2002,"Most of the anachronisms are fine by me.  Catapults, crossbows, gunpowder, telescopes - I understand it's all part of the fantasy; I know that all these things, modern though some of them are, have an Olde Worlde flavour that sits reasonably well with the swords and sorcery and clay bricks and visions and jewels and so forth.  But I draw the line at breast implants. Really!  I don't think there was a genuine pair of boobs in the whole movie. Believe me, I looked: we never see much of Kelly Hu (even when she's naked), so I'll admit the jury's out in her case, but I did get a decent squiz at half a dozen courtesans, another half-dozen street prostitutes and the odd female warrior, and without exception they not only have painfully unconvincing breasts, but painfully unconvincing EVERYTHING.  Their very skin seems to be made of plastic.  How is this possible?  Even in California, there must be some young actresses left who at least LOOK as though they have real flesh. ...Yes, it's a bad movie, made worse by the fact that there's real promise buried beneath the layers of badness, just as there's promise in ANY unfettered fantasy of simple heroism in the Ancient World.  (I kind of wish the Mummy movies had been set entirely in Ancient Egypt, without the 20th Century intruding, just as I wish the 20th Century hadn't intruded on ""The Scorpion King"" by means of breast implants.)  But if you deny the badness you simply don't have eyes and ears.  The dialogue is among the most unspeakably atrocious I've encountered - that is, in a film for which someone was actually PAID to write the script.  I can't be the first person to have complained about ""As long as we live and breathe, the Sorcerer shall die,"" a sentence which is about as sensible as ""Until I pay off my mortgage, Verdi was born on a Wednesday.""  Not all dialogue is unspeakable because it makes no sense, but it's all unspeakable for some reason.  And what's with that electric ghee-tar music that accompanies half the action scenes?  It's as if someone was deeply confused by the fact that the actor playing the hero is, in real life, a professional wrestler.  What if he'd been a ship hand?  Would they have played a hornpipe?",The Scorpion King
39,rosscinema,Better than expected action film,5,1 September 2003,"I totally expected to either hate this film or just roll my eyes at the ineptitude. But to my surprise it turned out to be fairly adequate as an action film. The story supposedly takes place either hundreds or thousands of years before ""The Mummy"" and The Rock plays Mathayus who is an Arkadian, part of a band of assassins who have been sent by their king (Roger Rees) to kill the enemies sorceress. They infiltrate the camp of their enemy which is ruled by Memnon (Steven Band), a sadistic ruler who has a sorceress named Cassandra (Kelly Hu). Cassandra has the ability of second sight and Memnon uses her to aid his army in winning battles. Mathayus and his group fail in their attempt and Memnon kills Mathayus's brother Jesup (Branscombe Richmond) and then takes Mathayus and buries him in sand up to his neck for the red fire ants. With the help of a horse thief named Arpid (Grant Heslov) they both escape and head to the city where Cassandra is held. Mathayus manages to get her but instead of killing her he takes her with him back to his Arkadian camp. When he gets back he convinces everyone that Memnon will come to kill them if they don't prepare to fight. Cassandra has a vision that everyone will be killed so they decide to go to where Memnon is and kill him first. This film is directed by Chuck Russell and he is greatly responsible for this being a decent action film. Russell also directed ""The Mask"" and ""Eraser"" so he does know what he's doing. The script makes a point of not taking itself seriously and there are some funny lines like Arpid uttering ""We cannot go to the Valley of Death, thats why its called Valley of Death"". The Rock is a capable action star but I did have a problem whenever he spoke. He either would mumble or speak very well. To well! Hu is jaw dropping beautiful and casting agents should look no further when they make the next James Bond film. She's perfect! The strategically placed hair over her breasts look like they were glued on. I'm not really recommending this film but I am saying that I didn't dislike it. As far as Saturday afternoon matinees go, this is just as good or just as bad as the rest. Besides the predictable story I was not impressed by the computer animated special effects like the cobras and the ants.

40,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Fun for the shear cheese of it,6,16 March 2015,"The ability to win over new fans is not easy when one is shoved into the limelight so quickly. After briefly appearing as The Scorpion King in Stephen Sommers' anticipated sequel The Mummy Returns (2001), Universal Studios believed that it was time to create their spin-off starring none other than Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Originally only taking part in wrestling, Johnson was bit by the acting bug and agreed to star in this film as his feature debut. As known by many, this spin-off movie was a prequel, to a sequel of a movie that was a remake of an older movie. Sounds confusing, but it can be understood. Once you think about it, it does make sense. As for being a well-written story,..not really. There are a lot of pluses to this film but it has its drawbacks too.As a film that tells the background to how Mathayus, The Scorpion King (Dwayne Johnson) got his name, it doesn't really declare itself publicly. Yet somehow, everyone knows by the end. Originally, Mathayus belonged to a group of hired assassins during a time when a ruthless dictator known as Memnon (Steven Brand) was looking to conquer everybody and anybody. Mathayus and his fellow assassins were hired to take out Memnon and a powerful sorceress (Kelly Hu) who sees visions of the future. All the same like other assassins hired to kill, they end up getting caught caring too much. This happens when Mathayus and the sorceress become attached to each other. As an origin story, the narrative is mostly predictable. Also, since it is a prequel, audiences already have an idea of what is going to happen. However, this doesn't make the viewing experience unwatchable. Aside from the story being a touch too cliché, there are a couple of other setbacks.The first belongs to the sorceress' powers to see into the future. There isn't any logic behind this other than it just being shown that she has these powers. In other words, the audience just has to accept this as a fact and not care about the reasoning. Yet for viewers who have a harder time shutting off their brain or are just more inquisitive, the understanding behind how she acquired her powers would've been appreciated to have. The other issue is the tone of the script, which constantly flip-flops in the midst of goofy and serious. Thus, the end result tends to be an entire cheese fest because you want to take the story seriously but can't because of how certain situations are handled. Having a character give a rather immature nod to the audience because someone went to bed with them, kind of breaks the rules on how serious a viewer can take this story. Another example is pairing up the protagonist with mildly unneeded sidekick named Arpid (Grant Haslov). Most of his comments are just too obvious to be even said. As for who wrote those moments into the script, it most likely belonged to William Osborne (best known for writing Twins (1988) & everyone's hated Stallone film Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot (1992)). The other writing credits belong to Stephen Sommers (rightfully so) and David Hayter (X-Men (2000), X-Men 2 (2003) & Watchmen (2009)). So it's not like every writer behind this production didn't have the credentials. The directing was also headed competently by the underrated Chuck Russell (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (1987), The Blob (1988) remake & The Mask (1994)). Even with its cheese factor, the main cast is able to perform okay. Dwayne Johnson was no doubt the right choice to be Mathayus because what would a spin-off origin movie be if the actor doesn't return to play the role he made? Steven Brand is a worthy opponent to Johnson but it probably would've been an even better idea if Michael Clarke Duncan (who plays along side Johnson) was the enemy. It just would've been a better showdown.Kelly Hu is attractive in her own right and doesn't give a bland performance either. The rest of the cast (including Grant Haslov) also act okay but nothing that is of much importance. They do help near the end and add to the overall cheese at times but they a necessity. Cinematography was ably contributed by John R. Leonetti who was able to mimic Adrian Biddle's work from Sommers' The Mummy (1999) universe. There are lots of desert shots, while the set pieces appear grand and ancient. The action was also well choreographed and since sword fights aren't exactly the most used types of action sequences; it entertains. For the musical score, John Debney composed behind the film. For this listening experience, Debney uses a blend of organic orchestra with what also sounds like occasional rock/pop beats. This was probably used in order to accommodate Johnson's fans but the beats actually don't mess with the score too much. The action cues sound appropriate with the scene it follows and it's in line with the genre. If the story to this movie was taken a little more seriously, this probably would've entertained more.Its script is not clear on everything and its unequal tone makes the actors look occasionally cheesy on film. It's okay in some ways and others not so much. Luckily, the camera-work, action, music and main cast are able to manipulate it in their favor to entertain on very mindless level.",The Scorpion King

It also features great supporting performances by Michael Clarke Duncan, Grant Heslov and Bernard Hill.The film (which, according to Dwayne Johnson, takes place about 10 years before the events of ""The Mummy Returns"") centers on the Akkadian assassin Mathyus (Johnson), whom we all know will later become the dreaded Scorpion King. He is one of the last of his kind in a world ruled by the vile villain Memnon (Brand), an evil dictator who uses the predictions of a sorcerer in his campaigns.He and his brother are hired to assassinate the sorcerer by Memnon's enemies. However, Mathyus soon discovers that the sorcerer is actually a stunning sorceress (Hu), and is captured by Memnon and forced to watch his brothers death. The sorceress (whom, unlike Memnon, is not truly evil) fools Memnon into sparing Mathyus' life, and he manages to escape with the help of a horse thief (Heslov).Mathyus decides to seek vengeance, and the movie gets moving- he kidnaps the sorceress Cassandra, joins forces with her, the horse thief, a ""magician""/inventor named Philos (Hill), Balthazar- leader of Memnon's enemies (Michael Clarke Duncan) and a few others, as they plot to overthrow his evil. And of course, along the way, he falls in love with the sorceress, and must deal with tensions between himself and the other characters.The film is your basic sword-and-sorcery epic. The movie is clearly modeled after the big action set-pieces- Mathyus dueling Memnon's cronies during a sandstorm, Mathyus and Bathazar's giant rumble, a fantastic chase through the streets and buildings of Gomorrah... It's all magnificently shot and for the most part, cleverly written, and it's a lot of fun to watch.The horse thief Arpid is a source of comedic relief, and there is great banter between Mathyus and the other characters. They are all generally likable (although somewhat underdeveloped and cliché), and you do care about them. It's also interesting to see the Scorpion King, formerly a villain, now in a heroic role. It's interesting to ponder what might have happened to turn him into the violent tyrant we saw of him in ""Mummy Returns."" All that being said, there are some flaws. The film has a 92 minute running length, and moves just a little too quickly, whereas the other ""Mummy"" movies were all 100+ minutes, and had a more natural pacing.In addition, mirroring 2001's ""Mummy Returns"", there are issues with some of the visual effects. In that, a few of them look fake. Very fake. A sandstorm and CG snakes stand out as looking downright silly. But overall, the film is a nice departure from the previous films in that a majority of scenes are done for-real, with CGI generally only used to enhance the scenes.I also have issue with the underdeveloped villain Memnon- he's just a bad-guy, with no real motivation other than wanting to rule the world, whereas other series villains like Imhotep or Emperor Han at least had reasons and motivations. Memnon's just a ""kill 'em all!"" kinda guy.But overall, the film is a very fun ride. It's not supposed to be taken seriously... it's nice, packaged fluff meant to entertain- and entertain is something it does perfectly. I am proud to say I still watch this film (along with the others, generally in a marathon) for a fun afternoon getaway.I give this an 8 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value.",The Scorpion King
42,Muhammad_Rafeeq,Watchable just for Fun ( American C+Movie ) My Ratings 8/10,8,3 March 2020,"The Scorpion King is a fun adventure with The Rock. While not holding up as a great film, The Scorpion King is an entertaining action movie. The fights are well choreography. The set and costume design are excellent and feel realistic.

44,xredgarnetx,One for the kiddies,6,11 July 2007,"SK is very loosely connected to THE MUMMY, which frankly doesn't matter one way or the other. The Rock, a former wrestler, stars in this low-budget sword & sorcery novelty about a Conan-type warrior fighting evil forces on his way to becoming the once and future king. The Rock is not really an actor, and it shows. The role might have been better placed in the hands of someone like Vin Diesel. To make matters worse, the action is klunkily handled and the plot and dialog are threadbare. I suspect this movie will hold some appeal to the younger ones. If nothing else, it helps pass time on a slow afternoon. When you see director Chuck Russell's name on a film, beware. He is strictly hit or miss. This one is sort of a miss, certainly where adults are concerned.",The Scorpion King

Right down to the idiot inventor.I was disappointed that the character doesn't live up to the name of the movie.  The Scorpion King has nothing to do with scorpions.  Which he doesn't even like.

To say that it's just a copy of some other property (like, say, Conan), is to give this movie a bum deal.The Rock has a charisma all his own, and the way his appearance is used to exemplify the ethnic look of the nearly extinct group of people he belongs to in this movie is brilliant. The movie has a trademark style and atmosphere which is entirely original.As a historical action/adventure fantasy epic, this movie is pretty successful and for any fan of cool-looking cinema fantasy, it's a treat.

49,mattymatt4ever,This movie ROCKS!,7,29 April 2002,"""The Scorpion King"" is entertainment.  Pure, mindless entertainment.  Lots of fun, lots of excitement, lots of slam-bang action.  Can you ask for anything more?  The Rock is good and charming, proving as good as any Van Damme or Schwarzenegger.  Sure, he's no Olivier, but he has reasonable acting talent and the potential to become our next big action star.  And this is one guy flick where I don't have to feel bad about the ladies in the crowd.  While the guys are enjoying the nonstop action and the beautiful Kelly Hu, the females can enjoy The Rock's hot body.  Grant Heslov, who some may remember from ""True Lies,"" is hilarious as The Rock's dim-witted sidekick.  So the film does have an equal balance of action and humor--an important quality in a film like this.  It was nifty casting Michael Clarke Duncan as The Rock's arch enemy who soon becomes his warrior pal.  The two of them are both built like horses.  In one scene, the two of them duke it out.  It's hard to determine what the outcome will be, because they're both equally strong.  ""The Scorpion King"" is a treat for all action fans.  Check your brain at the door.  You will have a kick-ass time!  My score:  7 (out of 10)",The Scorpion King
50,Victor Field,A blast for The Rock and his Millions and Millions of Fans.,6,7 July 2002,"""The Scorpion King"" follows in the grand tradition of such warrior epics as... ""Spartacus""? ""Ben Hur""? Even ""Conan The Barbarian""? Try ""Kull The Conqueror"" - not only is The Rock almost as accomplished an actor as Kevin Sorbo, but John Debney's score, like Joel Goldsmith's for the earlier film, is not immune to a rock beat. Electric guitars wailing under scenes set far, far in the past do not a movie easily taken seriously make (as anyone who's seen ""Young Guns"" will testify).To be fair, with ""Kull The Conqueror"" it was obvious tongues were in cheeks from the casting of Harvey Fierstein, and similarly there's enough evidence to indicate that this prequel to the two ""Mummy"" tales is meant to be at least in part intentionally funny. Then again, how seriously can you take anything presented ""in association with World Wrestling Federation Entertainment""?Anyway, He Who Asks If You Smell What He Cooks plays one of a band of mercenaries hired to restore a king to his throne and saving his country by wiping out the villain's seer (who foresees his battles). But betrayed, bereaved and left in the desert to die, it's not long before he, his comic relief sidekick and the sorceress (who needless to say doesn't really work for the evil side) are well and truly in the thick of it. It's also not long before viewers start playing Spot The Source Material -  one sequence set in a cave under the desert has ""Rambo"" written all over it. It's additionally not long before you wonder how this required four credited writers, including ""Mummy"" maestro Stephen Sommers (who leaves directing duties in the hands of Chuck Russell, a capable man even if he did do ""Eraser"") and ""X-Men""'s David Hayter.The movie clearly has less financial muscle behind it than the two other ones (not only do Industrial Light and Magic sit this one out, but it was filmed entirely in California); it occasionally oversteps the mark in trying to fit in everything (at one point our hero is literally catapulted into a harem!); and several of the actors could use a conviction transfusion... but then again, you don't really expect ""Six Feet Under"" with this kind of thing. With a reasonable running time and enough of a pace to make its flaws fairly easy to overlook, ""The Scorpion King"" plays like one of Renaissance Pictures' TV adventure shows, which is ultimately no bad thing - The Rock astride his trusty camel! Arrows propelling people through walls! Battles every ten minutes or so! People escaping everything from red ants to early experiments with gunpowder! Michael Clarke Duncan in a dress! Logic-defying escapes! Villains regularly urging disposable underlings to their deaths! Anachronistic dialogue (""After a hard day's looting and pillaging, there's no place like Gomorrah - except maybe Sodom"")! All this and a bonus for men in the gorgeous Kelly Hu spending the entire movie wearing considerably less than she did on ""Martial Law"" (though she gets very little chance to get physical)... it's all silly, but you can't deny that it sets out to entertain and does precisely that. And it does explain why he's called the Scorpion King, incidentally.By the way, soundtrack album ripoff alert - of the 16 tracks on the ""music from and inspired by"" album, only the Godsmack and Mushroomhead songs are actually in the movie, and then only over the end credits. As opposed to Debney's score album, which is where we came in.",The Scorpion King
51,SanteeFats,Good enough,7,6 July 2013,"This movie is a follow up from the Mummy movies. The Scorpion King never really shows up in the film. There is Dwayne Johnson who fights the evil dictator after his brothers are killed. Kelly Hu is soo hot as the sorceress who flees from Memnon the dictator when she is grabbed by the Rock. She loses her powers when she loses her virginity to the Rock but she still plays the game. They hook up with some rebels that are hiding at an oasis, including the late Michael Clarke Duncan. Such an early loss!!! The rebels organize around the Rock and Duncan. They attack the city where the bad guys are and end up winning when the Rock finally kills Memnon. All is then well with the ancient world.",The Scorpion King
52,jon.h.ochiai,Now this is fun,7,30 April 2002,"WWF Superstar, The Rock, makes in an impressive action star debut in Chuck Russell's ""The Scorpion King"". It a fun movie with a wafer thin plot, great bloodless action, and great looking people. Director Russell is also smart in that he keeps the movie to 90 minutes-- he does not trespass beyond where he is welcome. It is surprising that David Hayter wrote this screenplay. Hayter wrote ""X-Men"" which was an excellent comic book translation. Here it is comic book-like without the material. The plot, what little there is, has The Rock as Mathayas, the last member of an assassin clan, who is hired to kill the sorceress of the powerful warlord, Memnon (an evil and not very manly Steven Brand-- at least compared to The Rock which is a problem for a powerful villain.) Mathayas changes his mind when he sees that the supposedly evil sorceress is the beautiful Cassandra (played by the beautiful Kelly Hu). In the scene where we are introduced to Cassandra, she emerges from the bathing pool, her wet hair strategically falls over her breasts. Gravity and water do NOT work like that! And as she and The Rock escape through the water tunnels, it becomes clear that Kelly Hu will not be naked in this movie. Oh well, Hu has some great skimpy outfits. She really does a good job as Cassandra who is the beautiful temptress for Mathayas-- she has a smart edge to herself. Does she really love him? Can she be trusted? The Rock is a natural movie star. He has screen presence, charisma, and a sense of humor. He is good-looking and does the action scenes well. He is versatile. He doesn't even use his finishing move, ""The Rock Bottom"", in the movie. Though I was waiting for it. ""The Scorpion King"" is great fun for a hour and a half. Anyway, what are you going to watch until ""Spider-Man"" of ""Episode II"" come out? The Rock is someone to watch for in the future. That is ""What the Rock is cookin'.""",The Scorpion King
53,russem31,Why?,5,24 December 2005,"This spin off to the successful Mummy series takes a turn for the worse - why was this ""sort-of sequel"" necessary - to be only a The Rock vehicle (and not a good one at that)? Director Stephen Summers who made the first two Mummy films enjoyable, unfortunately relinquishes the directing reign for newcomer Chuck Russell, who doesn't do as good a job as Summers did. The acting in this film is also unmemorable - The Rock as Mathayus the Scorpion King does a so-so performance, with only Kelly Hu good (mostly because she is eye candy for the audience). Honestly, I'd rather see The Mummy 3 (but only if Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, Arnold Vosloo, Oded Fehr return). An average 5 out of 10.",The Scorpion King

The film has plenty of scenes with very good mixed effects, but most of them are very violent. The plot is very simple. When you see it you immediately remember another adventure film, ""Conan the Barbarian"" (1982), which is quite similar to the present one. Ex- Wrestling champion Dwayne Johnson showed his abilities fighting first to the strong Michael Clarke (you may see this actor also starring in ""The Planet of the Apes"" as Colonel Attar) and then against artificial Steven Brand.

With the exception, that it has nothing own in it, all is borrowed from somewhere else. I'm not saying that Hercules was brain wood, but at least it had some good episodes in it... I think, but it was so long ago when I saw the series.The main reason why this movie has been made was, that from some reason The Rock became a big name outside the wrestling audience, and the biggest movie he had been was The Mummy, where he played (or most of the time a crappy CGI effect played him) a villain named The Scorpion King, so someone came up with an idea to make his birth as an action flick.As a movie TSK is in the same level with Conan The Destroyer (yes, that horrible sequel for Conan the Barbarian): Mostly annoying and sometimes funny, but from all the wrong reasons.",The Scorpion King

57,anselmdaniel,Cheesy action,6,5 October 2019,"This review contains spoilers.The Scorpion King is an action movie that premiered in 2002. The movie is directed by Chuck Russell, produced by Sean Daniel, James Jacks, Vince McMahon, Kevin Misher, and Stephen Sommers. The screenplay is written by Stephen Sommers, William Osborne, and David Hayter with the story written by Stephen Sommers, and Jonathan Hales. The movie stars Dwayne Johnson. The Scorpion King takes place in the same universe as The Mummy movies and can be considered a prequel to the universe. The movie features Dwayne Johnson as Mathayus who must deal with the prophecy of the scorpion king.This movie is incredibly cheesy that it actually becomes fun. Even though there are elements in this movie that are cliched this seems to be what the movie expects. This is absolutely not a movie that has a deep story or an interesting plot. This is a movie that sets out to entertain first and foremost. The movie succeeds in the goal but at a cost for the audience to not fully understand what place this movie has.The movie takes place in The Mummy's universe that started with the 1999 The Mummy movie. This movie is more of an explanation to the backstory of The Mummy Returns rather than a prequel to The Mummy. The Scorpion King in general felt like a cash grab by the executives in charge of the entire project rather than a story that needed to be told. It felt like a movie that had severe problems overall in the reasons why it needed to be created. These problems made the movie feel like it lacks weight in its execution as the events that have happened here are not important. Malthus becoming the scorpion king does not add anything to the overall story in The Mummy movies.I would still recommend 'The Scorpion King'. Even with the problems that exist in the overall narrative, the movie sets out to entertain which it absolutely achieves.Grade: C",The Scorpion King

Without surprise the movie make it big into the box-office with load of The Rock's fan come to see him in this action pack movie. From very this moment there no doubt about it that he is probably the best actors of all the WWE ever produce.In my opinion The Rock have done a really good job in this (maybe a little over act), even though the dialogue suck the movie is much more entertaining than expected. The cast of star such as Kelly Hu (look stunningly hot!!

""The warrior that became a legend, the legend that became king...""  It didn't bother me too much, but I thought it was kind of uncool of them to do that.I must admit, I had very low expectations of this film when I walked into the theater, but I knew that it was directed by Chuck Russell (The Mask, Eraser, Bless The Child), so I thought it would be better directed than either of the Mummy films.  I have to say that I was throughly let down.  I don't know what came over Chuck Russell, but there were a number of times that I wanted to scream at the screen and say ""What the hell was that?""  In the first five minutes of the movie I knew I wasn't going to like it.  There was just too many cheesy things in it, and TERRIBLE one liners!  Maybe I'm biased and I just don't like The Rock?  I don't know.I'm not really one to say bad things about acting, so I'm not going to start here.  Although, I will say the only acting I was really impressed with was the acting of Grant Heslov.  I thought his character was stupid, but he did a good job with what he was given.  It took me a while to recognize him from ""Congo"" and ""True Lies"".  I was also rather impressed with Kelly Hu, not because of her acting skills, but because of her physique.  Quite the looker!  I thought it was hilarious that she was nearly naked throughout the entire movie!  I thought Michael Clarke Duncan did a pretty good job with his role, but nothing spectacular.As for story-line, it was incredibly simple, but that's not really a bad thing.  This is an action movie, it should be relatively simple.  There really isn't much to say there, some of the plot details were quite dumb, but the over-all story was ok.The special effects in the film were ok.  Sometimes really good, sometimes not so good.  I won't really say anything good or bad about them.  I will say, however, that NONE of the special effects were as cartoony as they are in the Mummy films.  Although, there was a lot less special effects in ""The Scorpion King"" than either of the Mummy films.I have to say that the comedy in the film was unbelievably stupid.  There were a few scenes where I chuckled a little, but most of the comedy was so stupid!Overall, I wouldn't say it was the worst movie I've ever seen, I've seen FAR FAR worse, but it isn't anything I would recommend shelling out 8 bucks to see in the theater.  I'd definitely recommend waiting till video or at least seeing at matinee prices.  I hope you enjoy the film more than I did. Thanks for reading,-Chris",The Scorpion King

Granted, the imagery may be impressive, and the action is exciting, but apart from a very few details, ""Scorpion King"" may as well be a completely different movie. In quality, it fares about as well as the average sword-and-sandal epic. There is a camp factor that hangs over the story, that you feel when listening to some passages of dialogue.

The Mummy energy, practically a trademark of Sommers, is definitely encompassed in this entertaining action/legend movie of ""The Scorpion King."" Led by Dwayne Johnson ""The Rock"" as Mathayus the Warrior with a heart, lovely Kelly Hu as Cassandra the Sorceress and object of beauty, sought by Steven Brand as Memnon the convincing evil menace of it all, and Michael Clarke Duncan as the equally brave ally Balthazar to Mathayus, this is your basic good vs. evil story splashed with fun and suspense - almost like an animated Disney film but with real live actors. An action packed myth/legend of a story, with humor/laughter sprinkled here and there at good pacing, along with special/digital effects, I almost felt at times it feels like the epic animation ""Princess Mononoke,"" where they have the villagers (tribes here) rounding up and backing the heroine (Mathayus here) and fighting to get rid of the evil source (Memnon here.) Other films have similar themes before: an earlier endeavor of Stephen Sommers, who wrote and directed ""Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book"" 1994, with Jason Scott Lee, Sam Neill, Cary Elwes, Lena Headey and John Cleese; director Xavier Koller's (received Oscar's Best Foreign Film ""Journey of Hope"" 1990) ""Squanto: A Warrior's Tale"" 1994; not forgetting director Richard Donner's ""LadyHawke"" 1985 with Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Alfred Molina.If you want to escape and have an enjoyable action movie, to forget your stress and strains beyond the world of cinema, go for it!",The Scorpion King

THE SCORPION KING succeeds on this level. The characters in the film are likeable and interesting and the fact is The Rock succeeded in making me forget he was The Rock. It was a good old-fashioned fantasy escape ride reminiscent of those from the early 1980s(more along the lines of THE SWORD AND THE SORCEROR and THE BEASTMASTER than CONAN) and probably the most enjoyable film of its type I've seen since then.,The Scorpion King
64,chrisbrown6453,Do you smell what Hollywood is cooking?,8,12 June 2002,"In this prequel to 1999s The Mummy, paid assassin Mathayus (The Rock), the ""Scorpion King"", battles against the evil Memnon (Stephen Brand), who, with the help of sorceress Cassandra (Kelly Hu), has destroyed almost all of the tribes within the country. Mathayuss aides include the warrior Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan) a professor (Bernard Hill) and a comedic sidekick (Grant Heslov).This film may not be all that motivated, and it certainly lacks originality, but it does provide 90 minutes of decent entertainment. Director Chuck Russell and producer/cowriter Stephen Sommers (who was at the helm of both The Mummy and The Mummy Returns) adopt the same approach as that of the Mummy films; take a seemingly serious adventure film and laugh it up. This approach worked for both of those films, and it works again here. The storyline is occasionally unclear, the prologue is rushed, the ending is predictable and the dialogue is sometimes cringeworthy. Yet the actors subtly behave as if they know this is the case, and this works to the films advantage.Im happy to point out that you dont need to have seen either of the Mummy films to appreciate this. While many things will be familiar to Mummy fans (notably the alltooobvious computer generated effects and the presence of The Rock), this is a completely different kind of adventure. Like both the Mummy films, it provides several wellexecuted action scenes, beautiful women and a selfmocking tone. However, this film also has a loud rock soundtrack (One of its best parts). These kinds of elements will almost certainly pull in the crowds, and they are used for pretty good effect.So how does The Rock stand up as an action hero? Well, I can say that he shows promise. While lacking the more deadpan approach of Brendan Fraser, he seems to enjoy himself when playing his role for laughs while simultaneously excelling in the fight scenes. Of course, he is lackluster in the dramatic scenes, but these are kept to a minimum. Stephen Brand is disappointing  for a villain, he just isnt menacing enough. Kelly Hu, however, really is one to watch out for in the future. Shes beautiful, likeable, and charismatic, and wholeheartedly joins in the films comic tone (it seems that she says some of the films more ""serious"" lines mockingly). Grant Heslov provides some funny moments, but most of the time its so obvious that hes overdoing it that he becomes annoying. Michael Clarke Duncan makes Balthazar an imposing figure, and Bernard Hill has fun in his small role as the professor.Its become easy for many to dislike the Mummy films because of their reputation as moneymaking machines. Yet at the same time, you cant deny that they are perfect as lighthearted, brainless fun, and The Scorpion King is no exception.",The Scorpion King

His acting (scenes where he has to speak script lines) is a bit stiff (not as stiff as Chris Rock's performance in ""Down to Earth""!). But the number of quiet moments in the movie is (thankfully) limited and so this does not get in the way of a decent movie.It reminds me of a Burt Lancaster/swashbuckler type movie. The hero, a tough, street-wise, not-too-dumb, not-too-smart, nice guy always wins the day, gets the girl, and conquers all.

It made for a very entertaining action-packed yarn. From the mind of the Mummy creator Stephen Sommers, here comes the latest action hero of the early 2000s. This was also the first movie where Kelly Hu made an appearance. She would later become Lady Deathstrike in X2. Such a beauty!

Now moviegoers, this film has no mummies whatsoever. You could say this is somewhat of an origin on how The Rock who plays the Arcadian skilled assassin, Mathayus - rises to become a king and how he got the Scorpion title labelled. The movie feels like a B-Grade PlayStation 2 game where we have a dull story, interesting action sequences including showcasing The Rock's wrestling skills and his swordsmanship. Now ill be completely truthful here and say this film isn't too bad - like its not good but its not bad. The movie hardly has any CGI other than some fire scenes and snake scenes but that's alright. The film feels more like Conan then anything relevant to the Mummy. We have swords and basic sorcery without any monsters, which was a huge surprise.

68,The_Wood,Surprisingly Fun 7/10,7,20 April 2002,"As much as I hate to admit it, I enjoyed The Scorpion King from start to finish.  The film is far from perfect.  It has a bland color tone; terrible comedic side-kick; and it rips off a lot from other movies.  Even noticing these errors, I couldn't help but smile.  The film knows it is nothing more than a cheesy barbarian film and it embraces that.  The film has more in common with such guilty-pleasure flicks as Army of Darkness, then it does with the over-done Mummy movies.  If you don't mind watching a barbarian movie, chances are you are going to have a fun time with this film.  A very entertaining fun surprise.",The Scorpion King
69,luke-a-mcgowan,"Great guilty pleasure, featuring awesome fight scenes even if nothing else catches your fancy",8,8 November 2015,"Hello sir, I'll have a sword and sandal movie with extra cheese.The Scorpion King remains one of my most beloved movies of all time. Its not trying to be an Oscar-calibre movie like Gladiator (which is fine coming from someone who found Gladiator boring), rather its just a chance to watch The Rock crush people on the big screen. Dwayne Johnson is definitely in his acting debut here - he is a big beefy guy who can hold his own in the action but don't ask him to do much else. His love scene with Kelly Hu is excruciating (no thanks to the writing) and even his comic timing is a bit iffy (save for one hilarious scene where he suggests to a young street urchin ""I'll kill half, you kill half"").Director Chuck Russell impresses me with this film. He's definitely the strong point with his well directed fight scenes and good pacing. One of the standouts of hiring The Rock is that you're going to have awesome fight scenes. The Scorpion King's fight scenes are so awesome that I can watch this movie on repeat and never get sick of it. Its clear that they're extremely choreographed - its clear that extras are holding back waiting to fight - but they're still awesome, featuring an array of weapons (conventional and improvised) wielded by awesome beefcakes like Johnson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Ralf Moeller and Steven Brand. Some scenes feel completely staged - such as a pitchfork spear managing to land perfectly around Johnson's throat to pin him in place against a never-before-seen piece of wood - but its still awesome fun to watch. Characters often appear where they are needed, despite the implausibility. I can forgive all of this.The Scorpion King is a treat to look at - the visuals are honestly more convincing than some of the big budget fare these days, with a great attention to detail (such as digitally created civilians the size of ants rushing to the aid of a person crushed by a giant gong, despite not having any impact on the story). The sound editing is hit and miss - sometimes a sword will make a metal-on-sheath sound as it is pulled from a cloth scabbard, while in others the sound of metal on flesh is so believable it makes me flinch. Costumes are nice (especially the red guards) and production design is very impressive.The screenplay is nice and simple - Mathayus' brother is killed during a botched assassination and he seeks revenge. The extended edition reveals a prophecy played central part - I'm much happier without that. However, the dialogue and characters are cheesy and shallow. We never even learn half the main characters' names (Heslov goes by ""horse thief"" or ""my friend"" while Hu goes by ""Sorceress""). There's some choice humour and some that doesn't land (""there's no need to be concerned miss"" is lame even by 10 year old standards"").On the acting front, the highlights include the gorgeous Kelly Hu as Cassandra, a lovable Bernard Hill as Philos and Michael Clarke Duncan as Nubian King Balthazar. What a gem this guy was - this is the film that introduced me to him. He's such a beast with his deep voice and bulging muscles, going toe-to-toe with Johnson in a brawl that starts because both men are so strong their swords shatter on impact. If you don't laugh at that you're made of stone. Brand has his moments as the antagonist Memnon, great from a physical standpoint even though he can't quite carry the serious moments. Grant Heslov drives me insane with his high-pitched voice and goofy sidekick persona.The Scorpion King is a great guilty pleasure. Its simple storyline stops it being goofy, and its awesome fight scenes between beefcake actors make it worth your while. Imagine Predator meets Gladiator with a pinch of Mortal Kombat, and you've got a fair idea.",The Scorpion King
70,OldAle1,better-than-expected Conanesque family fare,5,25 November 2008,"Noot as ridiculous as first might appear: take a very popular series with a charismatic couple of young stars with at least slight acting talent -- replace those stars with a WWE muscleman of limited thespian talents, and a beautiful but pretty well unknown Eurasian starlet -- completely change the setting, time, and tone of the film from its predecessors -- and drop the budget by about 40% from the immediate previous film. Recipe for disaster, right? Not really. Not when the first two films in the ""trilogy"" were ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", which don't have a whole lot of quality to drop off from in the first place; and not when your original star is the dubious pretty-boy Brendan Fraser. I'll admit I was a little scared at the prospect of seeing a film starring ""The Rock"", but ultimately I was won over if not by his charm (or lack of it) than by his seeming good humor at playing in what is essentially a neo-Conan movie. If the first two films took their primary inspiration from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" it's perhaps fair to say that they suffer in part by being such unworthy descendants of a rather superior adventure film; the Conan films on the other hand aren't really anything great as film-making, and The Rock doesn't really do so badly in comparison with Ahhnold; hey, at least his English is fluent. The action moves along, Kelly Hu is indeed a babe, and the film has a quite reasonable running time of an hour and half, not enough time to get me bored and irritated. The most significant problem I had with the film is really that it couldn't seem to make up its mind as to whether it wanted to be a more grown-up, violent action movie or a kid's adventure story. Thus the PG-13 rating and the rather toned-down (if not emasculated) Michael Clark Duncan character. Still, it's good stupid fun and far and away the best of the three films.",The Scorpion King
71,moviewiz-4,Ordinary story..,6,2 May 2003,"""The Scorpion King"" has the characteristics of an action movie but the story is too far behind. The actors and actresses in the movie seem have bad acting and the story doesn't even reflect the title. ""The Scorpion King"", where is the ""Scorpion""..

72,stormhawk2021,Warrior + Legend = King,5,10 January 2018,"When in 2001 he premiered in theaters 'The Return of the Mummy', if something caught the attention of the audience, was the presence of a well-known character known in the film as ""The Scorpion King"", one of the two villains who populated the tape, and that Stephen Sommers introduced in order to get more slice of the universe he had created. Such was the acceptance of the character that Universal did not think twice and called Sommers for a possible spin-off that finally ended up occupying Charles Russell (""The Mask"").The result was a product totally in pursuit of its strong protagonist, a Dwayne Johnson who already gave levels of charisma but still not as high as he would give years later. However, it must be recognized that he was charismatic and totally aware of the type of product he was shooting (with two winks to 'Indiana Jones and The Temple of the Damned' and, in general, to the most ancient adventure films), that is, a product totally innocuous, shot with ingenuity and fondness to the cinema of series B. A film in which the hand of Sommers in the script and the dialogues is noted, and with a Chuck Russell unfolding quite well in the tasks of direction of the tape.In short, 'The Scorpion King' was a good starting point for the career of Dwayne Johnson resulting in an innocent film and fully consistent with the intentions of those responsible and in pursuit of its strong protagonist. A laudable entertainment product with correct interpretations by Johnson himself, Michael Clarke Duncan, Grant Heslov, Kelly Hu, Peter Facinelli and a good villain Steven Brand gave life to.-The best: Your complete honesty. Dwayne Johnson demonstrating his gifts for the physical section and his charisma. His winks and aroma to the cinema of adventures totally old.-The worst: There is not much to scratch, it is a product created only and exclusively for its protagonist, with all the pros and cons that entails.",The Scorpion King

Kelly Hu is really cool as the sexy Cassandra, and the last time I saw her was getting strangled by Jason.  It's a good change.  Steven Brand does really good as the evil villain and I enjoyed his presence.  Grant Heslov was good as the comic relief and he brought good comedy to action.  Michael Clarke Duncan was good as Balthazar and his fight with the Rock was cool.  Was it just me or was E.Honda a night guard at the last fight scene?

74,ivanmessimilos,My guilty pleasure,7,28 July 2021,"It would take me a while to compile a top 10 list of guilty pleasure movies, but one thing is for sure, this movie would go into the top 3 without thinking.As a kid, I watched wrestling, WWF, WWE and other events, and The Rock was my favorite fighter. Knowing that a movie had come out in which he starred was the best thing in the world to a then sixth grade elementary school boy. It was his first starring role in a film with which he began his film career becoming later action star Dwayne Johnson however at the time he was still The Rock. From today's perspective, the film has gathered more than a solid cast, in addition to Dwayne, there is also the late Clarke Duncan (excellent in film, and otherwise he was one of my favorite actors at the time), Kelly Hu, Peter Facinelli and even one Bernard Hill who was then starring in The Lord of the Rings (King Theoden).The action is as follows: King Memnom has conquered many nations because he has a sorceress on his side who sees the future and predicts the outcome of battles. To stop him from conquering the world, people hire three famous mercenaries whose goal is to kill that sorceress to stop the evil king. Then the show begins.The film is primarily very entertaining, it contains a handful of action, explosions (!), scorpions, snakes, sword fights, pretty girls, humor, a few great sequences, a good and powerful soundtrack (today I listen I stand alone in my head), so absolutely everything what does it take for an average twelve-year-old to look at that VHS for the first time and immediately rewind it and look at it from the beginning 😄.Forget the logic, turn off the brain, see how The Rock became Dwayne Johnson action star. Do I have to point out that the rating of the film is unfairly low ?! 😄",The Scorpion King
75,darkdementress,Brainless Fun,5,6 September 2019,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was a teen and would of given it a 7/10 but now that I'm an adult and watched it again its definitely verging on 4/10. The bad: Cheesy lines,no historical accuracy to speak of,over sexualized and stereotypical female acting,a boring villain and no real relations to the second mummy movie.. The rock is too goofy and his side kick is annoying af. For having a 14A rating this should of been far more serious, less smashy smashy every ten seconds and more actual story. Cuz you know,adults are suppose to comprehend that kind of thing! Pros: The rock is a combat power house and even tho there is too much fighting he makes it believable. This is a zone out and ""no thinking required"" kinda movie. Some of the phrases are memorable. I liked the ending.",The Scorpion King
76,carlos37andre,Definitely a guilty pleasure,7,8 June 2020,"This movie has one of the best opening scenes I've ever seen. How do I begin? The Rock's first line ever in a movie (in English) is ""boo"". He shoots people with arrows and they FLY, and of course, you have a rock n' roll soundtrack in a movie set in 3000 B.C Egypt. How can you not love this? One of my main complains actually, is that at some point they stop using the music with the electric guitars (right around 30/40 minutes into it, and that was a disappointment).For real tho, the movie is bad, and I know. It's not horrible in every single way (is in almost every single way), but is really bad (maybe a 3/10? Probably 2/10). However, tho, this just became one guilty pleasure of mine, I had a lot of fun watching it. So, yeah, I know it's bad, but still, the rest of the review is based on the fact I had fun with how absurd and funny some parts of it are.As I said, I freaking love the opening scene, and I think the movie is awesome for its first 30ish minutes. Right after The Rock escapes the giant ants (?) the movie drags a bit, and it's a bit boring for a while, there are some silly moments here and there (like the fighting in the sand storm/cave, which is amazing), but overall it isn't has fun as the first part, and the last part. So it gets on track by the third act (last 20 minutes basically).The whole scene with Michael Clarke Duncan dressed as a woman, the snake stuff, The Rock been shot in the back, taking the arrow out and using the same arrow to shot the bad guy who proceeds to fly 10 meters forward finally falling to his death while explosions happen (cause, why not?), is just amazing cinema right here.Anyways, as I said, Scorpion King is a bad movie, but it has such insane stuff, that made me laugh and enjoy myself throughout basically 60% of it, so that's what the 7/10 grade is based on. If you are into the so bad that's good type of movie, this is definitely a must see.Side not: The Sorceress apparently loses her power when she bangs...? Like, why? lol",The Scorpion King
77,wnterstar,Just misses,4,21 April 2006,"This movie has a lot going for it. Terrific special effects, wonderful cinematography, a decent plot and a wonderful score.Unfortunately, it also has a poor script. Oh, and who told The Rock he could act? The man was stiff and unbelievable as the scorpion king. This was supposed to be a prequel to The Mummy, but it lacks the charm of the mummy. I never became involved with the characters so I didn't care what happened to them. The battle scenes were OK, but a bit confusing...who's fighting whom? This is a good example of a decent movie gone bad. I would stick with the first two movies in this series and leave this one alone.",The Scorpion King
78,Spideyfan-963-246215,The Scorpion King (2002),7,20 November 2017,"The Scorpion King (2002) Starring: Dwayne Johnson, Kelly Hu, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steven Brand, Bernard Hill, Grant Heslov, Peter Facinelli, Ralf Moeller, Branscombe Richmond, Roger Rees, Sherri Howard, Conrad Roberts, Joseph Ruskin, Esteban Cueto, Nils Allen Stewart, and Amy Hunter Directed By: Chuck Russell Review WARRIOR. LEGEND. KING. This is written by the king of popcorn movies (in my opinion) Stephen Sommers. After making it big with two mummy movies he wrote this as the start of a spin-off series for the character in The Mummy returns. In the notorious city of Gomorrah, an evil ruler is determined to lay waste to all the nomadic peoples of the desert. The few remaining tribes, never natural allies, have to unite or perish. Knowing their enemy relies on the visions of a sorcerer, they hire a skilled assassin, Mathayus to eliminate the visionary. After infiltrating the enemy camp, Mathayus discovers that the sorcerer is in fact a beautiful woman. Rather than eliminate her, he takes her deep into the desert badlands, knowing that the ruler's henchman will stop at nothing to rescue her and bring her back. Seriously wounded in the ensuing battle, Mathayus must find the strength to lead his scrappy band of allies back to Gomorrah for a final confrontation. This film is going to go on my guilty pleasure list whenever I make such a list. This film came out in a time when wrestling was big and popular which is why it's produced the WWE. They got the WWE's most charismatic and likable wrestler The Rock. The Rock does a fairly great job considering I do believe this is his first movie role. Kelly Hu who played Lady Deathstrike in X-Men: United is the beautiful sorceress Cassandra and she's just hot. She pulled a good performance but did I mention she's hot. Michael Clarke Duncan is also in this as Balthazar and he was doing pretty good not as great as some of his other performances but I believe he knew what kind of movie he was in. You can tell its written by Stephen Sommers because only Stephen would have Mathayus as the badass hero, Cassandra as the beautiful love interest and Arpid as the comic relief. Much like Van Helsing, Anna, and Carl. His films are very clichéd, adventurous and action packed. They've made for great fun. This film has great ton of action and has that adventure vibe. It even looks like The Mummy Returns in production design but that's probably because it's a spin-off set in Egypt. The direction from Chuck Russel is pretty good, he's done great films like the mask with Jim Carry and A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors tow films I really enjoy. This time around its like he saw the script and said you know what lets have fun with this and tried to take care of the actors so they can put out a good performance. Some of his shots in the action scenes are not always great but that's just from like one scene where Mathayus is about to shoot Memnon but then shoots the guard who's about to ax the kid. Once he gets down from the roof there was like this really bad shot from the camera as he fled. Apparently The Rock is a method actor so in that scene where the fire ants are about to eat his flesh those are real ants he said apparently even though they look fake. The Scorpion King is a fun action-adventure fantasy romp that tries to be just that and nothing more. It has good performances, some pretty decent direction and fairly good writing, some poor shots and effects but its fun from beginning to end. You can ask The Scorpion King no more than that. I'm giving The Scorpion King a three and a half out of five.",The Scorpion King
79,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,A daily comment from Midget Emma: The Scorpion King (2002),2,8 March 2008,"This ""Mummy"" spin-off should never have been made. It was sloppy. It never got me in suspense and The Rock was so wrong for this. Not as good as The Mummy movies.I hated the music. When will they get that rock music doesn't belong in a movie like this.I couldn't stand this. I wanted to fall asleep but couldn't because i can't comment on something that i haven't seen all the way through.This has way more comedy then action. Sometimes the jokes don't even raise a giggle in the room.It feels like the Rock tries to bring wrestling to the movie. The rock should return to wrestling or keep doing kids comedy.I recommend you save your cash and go get a decent movie instead.2/10",The Scorpion King

92,Mr. Pulse,Oy.,4,28 April 2002,"The Scorpion King marks the official start of the 2002 summer movie season, and woe be the moviegoer who wants logic and brains in his movie.  If The Rock's starring debut is any indication, this summer will be the worst on record.  Scratch that; it's not an indication, it's a warning.  Summer movies are here; no brains allowed.Audiences should have known something was up when Universal claimed they were so excited by The Rock's `performance' in The Mummy Returns that they simply had to give him his own starring vehicle.  In his five minutes of actual screen time (the rest of his performance was completed by a CGI scorpion), he did little more than grimace, grunt, and growl.This film charts the character's ascendancy, from mercenary named Mathayus to a powerful sovereign capable of a transformation into a giant CGI creature.  A terrible despot named Memnon (Steven Brand) rules the ancient world with an iron, arrow-catching fist, with the aid of a clairvoyant, semi-nude sorcerer (Kelly Hu).  Over the course of ninety-odd minutes and endless swordfights, Mathayus tries time and time again to kill Memnon while bearing his teeth and arching his eyebrow.Clearly a film in the Conan vein, The Scorpion King gives The Rock plenty of opportunity to twirl things in the air and glower with hammy abandon.  Of course, the dialogue is kept to a minimum.  `I've come for the woman  and your head' is about the most complex sentence Mathayus utters; although you might be inclined to believe that the character's silence is less a function of his stupidity than the film's inability to go more than four minutes without increasing the body count.I never thought I could miss the Mummy movies so much. While Steven Sommers' movies were dumb, he knew how to make great action sequences.  The Scorpion King, all clanging swords with squishy sound effects, is a film dying for a great action scene.  Time and time again, indistinct royal guards charge The Rock, who dispatches them with quick, bloodless swipes from his sword. Helpfully, The Rock's sword appears to be enchanted; no matter how many times it gets lost or broken, it always reappears at his waist at the start of the next scene.In a crazier movie, The Rock's overbearing acting style, wide eyed and frowning like he smells something bad, could work.  But director Chuck Russell's work is uninspired; he's missing the sense of uninhibited abandon he brought to The Mask.  A novel of The Scorpion King would probably be just as bad as the movie; there are no standout images, no great fights, no good performances, and nothing worth remembering.  It is the epitome of bad Hollywood filmmaking.  Here's hoping this bad omen is only a false alarm.",The Scorpion King

So I was quite looking forward to another instalment and was hopeful that the Rock could carry off a transition from wrestling ring to movie screen smoothly. Unfortunately what happened is an insipid script, some dire acting and third rate special effects which leave the audience cold. The fun is just not here and it's a real shame it just didn't happen. On the plus side Kelly Hu looks amazing but thats about all that can be recommended from this.Although one funny thing is people on message boards pointing out historical accuracies in this and the mummy films, gee because I thought they were real!

This movie's soundtrack contains nothing of what is in the movie.  I hate that.Yes, the music was good, but on to other things.  This movie is the prequel to the ""Mummy"" series which were such a success.  I must say it was a nice addition, since it didn't completely destroy the series' plot.  It showed Mathayus' coming of power quite nicely, but failed to see him for what he truly was.We see him as a bloodthirsty tyrant in ""The Mummy Returns"", yet he is nothing like this in ""The Scorpion King"".  Instead, he is a totally different character (not unlike ""Mission:  Impossible's"" Ethan Hunt).  He aids a young boy, falls in love with a sorceress, cares for his brother, and wants to do the right thing.  Like I said, a total contrast.  I suppose the creators of this movie just couldn't make Mathayus be a bad guy.For most of the movie we see plenty of action sequences.  In fact, I think that's all the movie was, really.  Just there to show us the Rock's brawn. It failed to deliver a decent plot or good character development (although one character is a great comic relief).  The action sequences were nicely done, but we all know that one man against a hundred foes is likely to fail. ""The Scorpion King"" is just like any of those other movies that gives us a hero who can withstand anything.  In fact, he takes an arrow in his bare back toward the end and keeps on fighting.I'd love to go on about this movie, but there's not much more to say considering how shallow it was.  I will say that I was extremely skeptical before I saw it, but a little impressed when I did see it.  It may or may not be worth your time.  It just depends on how much you like the wrestling/male-soap-opera industry, I suppose.",The Scorpion King
95,Artemis-9,"Don't read this, and don't watch the movie!",3,8 May 2004,"Well, I warned you. This would have been a good adventure and action movie because it has a couple of beautiful girls, and a couple of beefy guys who know how to make a swordfight and a fistfight look real. The script is the same copy-re-write of a thousand other films since Hollywood discovered Sindbad and One Thousand Nights - so it makes for light entertainment, badly needed for people who watch the news on telly. BUT, then the silent majority of special effects people came in, darkened ALL action scenes to the point of making them invisible, and if there was not a couple of movie reviews pointing your attention to (major spoiler) major cleavage showing on a couple of girls, you would have missed those five seconds, crucial moment. A film without any redeeming valour? Oh, Gosh, no. I'll remember to my death bed THE SCENE. A 12-year-old boy holds a coin in his hand, and thinks hard what wish to make in front of the wishes fountain. He is about to ask, ""Please, make me older so I can watch Scorpion King without censorship cuts."" He rolls the coin in his fingers, and thinks best, ""Please, let me watch Scorpion King before they tainted the picture pit black."" Then, after rolling his eyes (obviously giving up such utterly preposterous wishes) he bites his lower lip and does make a firm wish - which is immediately fulfilled on the spot. Yes... for these five seconds scene, you should try to rent this movie, if you're still wondering what slightly older boys are thinking about this very moment. What a pity producers these days have so much money to spend. Adventure movies were better when, after filming the girls in flimsy veils, and the butch guys butchering each others with daggers and kicks to the face, they had no money to destroy the movie with stinking brown paint.

You get to see the Rock looking like an idiot charging into battle on a camel.3.  The script is laughably bad.4.  The Rock's lines are mostly limited to grunts and one-liners.5.  You get to see Kelly Hu in an outfit that looks like a bathrobe that was shredded and then partially taped back together.6.  The costumes and props (as well as most of the extras) look like they were leftovers from Braveheart, Conan, Shaka Zulu, Mummy 2, Brotherhood of the Wolf, and Moulin Rouge.  All at once.7.  More medieval, multicultural T and A then Xena, Hercules, Beastmaster, and V.I.P. combined.  (actually pre-medieval by several k... I don't think viewers will care or notice either way)8. Peter Facinelli looks like a scrubby Tom Cruise, except maybe a little shorter.  Wait a second, that's probably a reason NOT to see SK...8.

He's actually not that bad at acting. I think the best way of describing this is think Conan meets Indiana Jones with The Rock in it.

102,SILENCEikillyou,A Wrestler Who Can Act??? What's this world coming to?,7,10 October 2002,"I'm comin' right out with it:  When the Scorpion King was featured in the Mummy I just knew I would hate it.  I've never like movies where a well-known actor has had the lead role.  Having said that, I've liked many where they were in the film; The Princess Bride, Predator, and others. However, most of them stink when the wrestler wants to hog the lead role in a film that might have been, otherwise, pretty good.  Television shows included.  Now, The Scorpion King was different, to say the least.  The Rock even had some 'Schwartzenagger-esque' comments and one-liners that did nothing for the movie, but coming from him, somehow, they were okay.  He's got real acting talent; I'd say.  Hell, at least as much as Arnold (and I like a lot of his movies for their genre).  The Rock even holds a lot over actors like Segal, Van Damme, that I can think of, right now.  He even toned down some of his wrestling cockiness for this role (though, not much).  I will definately watch any other movie he makes, now.  And there's hope for wrestlers after getting their noggins bashed in many times.What worked:  The special effects were quite cool and not over-used where it could be helped.  I've never heard of the lead female actress, either, but she was good, too.  In fact, all the performances were good for the genre... though, like one other comment was made, could have been better.  It had it's share of cheese filling, but it was a fun movie to watch and I'm sure I'll buy it for the fighting sequences, alone.What didn't work:  Which brings me to one of the things that didn't really 'jive' with me.  The lead antagonist role.  By visual comparison, there was no way that guy could have matched with The Rock, even by physique.  Not that brawn and muscle should always prevail, but this guy (for half of the movie) I was sure he was Billy Ray Cyrus.  He isn't, of course, but he just didn't seem like a formidable foe for this viewer.  Sure, he could have skills, but so did the Acadian (Sp.?) if not more so as an assasin trained for life.***Spoiler*** - One would know from the beginning of the movie that the little twerp was no match for The Rock's character.  But, I'm sure the movie wasn't really trying to hide the final outcome.  ***Spoiler Over***!!!I give this one 7/10 - Definately could have been better, but I'm glad it was as good as it was.  A MUST SEE!!  For action fans.thank you",The Scorpion King
103,bullions27,Hecules/Xena episode with a bigger budget,1,7 September 2002,"I don't understand how anyone could compare this to the original Conan movie. Conan the Barbarian was handled with great direction, music, and an excellent storyline. Maybe if you compare this to Conan the Destroyer, then yes I can see the similarities. Anyway, forget what you've seen with the Mummy Returns. Scorpion King tosses all rationality out the window, and is essentially a drawn out Hercules/Xena episode (with the horrible costumes included), with a lot of rock and metal and absurd dialogue from the Great One to make it look ""modern"" and ""cool"". Hey, this reminds me a lot of Kull the Conqueror in fact. Nothing in the movie makes any sense, and when actors begin to show emotion and drama (forcing them to actually act), it becomes ridiculous. Dwayne Johnson has done better as the Rock then he does as Mathayus. Sad to say, I did expect more with this movie.

Well, I smell what The Rock is cooking and let me tell you, it is a fragrant whiff of awesome! Here is the recipe for success when it comes to a movie like this: one suave wrestler - whose physique and facial expressions trump any acting ability that some elitist film snob would expect of him; a handful of extravagant fight scenes accompanied by cartoonish sound effects; one sexy, barely dressed actress - just in case the testosterone-induced fight scenes aren't enough to attract the male demographic; and lets not forget the numerous one-liners left over from Brendan Fraser's Mummy dialogue. It's true that there is a shameless theft from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom where The Rock escapes arrows by running behind a rolling gong. But then again, in Temple Indy was escaping machine gun fire. – SPOILER ALERT - The movie ends quite abruptly and I felt deprived of a climactic battle between the rebels and the army of the awkwardly Anglo fascist villain. There are those who would make a silly fuss over the historical accuracy of The Scorpion King. As is common knowledge, the actual Scorpion King was a skinny Jewish guy. To those people, I would say, if you want historical accuracy, go watch Xena Warrior Princess. This is about The Rock, people!

106,EdYerkeRobins,"""The Scorpion King"" Hits Rock Bottom!",1,21 April 2002,"Although his much clamored about role in ""The Mummy Returns"" only amounted to less than five minutes of actual screen time, the media attention and subsequent sales were enough to insure that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was already signed up for the lead role in the film's prequel, ""The Scorpion King"".  Speculation amongst wrestling and movie fans raged, as both wondered whether the film would be a hit or a flop, and whether Johnson was willing to take a page from wrestling icon Hulk Hogan's book and risk putting out a bad film for the chance of becoming a legitimate star in the wrestling and movie world.  It turns out he is following more along the lines of ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, starring in a movie that is nowhere near as bad as Hogan's films, but entertaining enough for all the wrong reasons to earn the title of ""cult classic"".Johnson's role in ""The Mummy Returns"" did not require him to speak.  In retrospect, this is the best thing they could do for that role, as it left the character with a shred of credibility.  As Mathayus (the man who would be the Scorpion King), Johnson blatantly overacts, treating the entire film as if he were simply cutting a long WWF promo.  It's a legitimate shock that he doesn't burst out an ""It doesn't matter!"" or ""If you smel-l-l-l-l-l-l what Mathayus is cookin'!"" during the course of the film.  As it is, there are surprisingly few wrestling moves and only a few subtle references to The Rock's WWF character.  However, given that this film, like ""The Mummy Returns"", credits him as The Rock and seems to be aiming toward attracting an audience of wrestling fans, it is puzzling and interesting that there weren't more obvious references.To make up for the lack of wrestling moves, the film promises and delivers nothing but action! The paper-thin plot has its share of holes, but it doesn't matter (no pun intended) when the film is 90% action.  Long stretches of the film are devoted to non-stop violence, Johnson against all comers, with barely a scratch against him.  This type of ""invincible hero destroys mobs of foes with the bat of an eyelash"" style action has never been realistic or appealing, especially in a non-gory (due to the film's PG-13 rating) context, but if anyone is to make it look believable, it's Johnson.  Those who bought tickets solely to see ""The Rock whip some candy ass!"" will not be disappointed.  To those who were hoping for something more, there's always the inevitable sequel (especially given the most obvious plot hole of The Scorpion King being a villain in ""The Mummy Returns"" and a hero in this film).Perhaps it would be easier to take the film seriously if it wasn't so cheesy and unintentionally funny.  Vast amounts of CGI are thankfully spared, but the CGI ants and snakes that do make appearances are plastic-like in appearance, unrealistically shiny, and nowhere near convincing.  As if that alone weren't bad enough, what does Johnson do? Squash the ants with his chin.  Though a little tongue-in-cheek, the majority of sequences such as these are presented seriously, which makes them all the more funny.  Ironically, the scenes that are played for laughs, such as those with comic relief, are for the most part not funny.  Also, in true cult fashion, one of the film's biggest draws is an attractive female lead.  In this case, said lead is Kelly Hu, who actually gives the best performance of the movie (not that anyone really noticed due to her wearing of the skimpiest outfit in the movie).This film has all the elements (lots of meaningless violence, a popular celebrity making a total fool of himself with a poor performance, thin plot, unintentional humor, and a sexy lead) to be a cult classic, and on this level it's very enjoyable.  Although the film was by all means terrible, and the worst I have seen all year, it's a decent stepping stone for Johnson to have a legitimate acting career some day (or, more likely, a semi-legitimate career in the fashion of another wrestler turned actor, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper), and had parts that were enjoyable.  It's definitely not a film worth $9 though, wait for it to come out on video, then get a party together and laugh at it.",The Scorpion King

Only having ""The Rock"" is the common thing between both movies, other than that it can stand out as independent movie that has its own story and acts as prequel to ""The Mummy"" in the last five minutes only.The movie starts with explanation of the background of ""The Rock"" and the other characters, with a sufficient covering for their motives, conflicts, history and style of living.The fights here are a lot and well maid, what makes them better is the good shape of ""The Rock"" and the other involved actors.The acting is not remarkable, we don't see enough reactions on the faces of the actors due to the nature of the movie.Most of the scenes are in the dessert and some ancient cities, but you don't get the feeling that this is older than ""The Mummy"" by thousands of years. You can believe it's old by not seeing ""The Rock"" famous smile at all and with the presence of his weird eyebrows.The directing is good in most of the movie, but there are some details that make you feel thay they mixed it with ""The Mummy"" although the time gap between them. For example the clothes of the scorpion king guards, is it possible that it's the same clothes they used few thousand years later in ""The Mummy 2"" ?! And if it's supposed to be an Arabic origin culture, how they couldn't manage to get people speak Arabic even if it's week Arabic as we saw in ""The Mummy"" ?! This movie lacks the mysteries and tricks of ""The Mummy"", because simply it's not treasure hunting movie, so don't expect that here.Finally it's a good adventure movie that was about to be a low class cheap movie but unexpectedly it's quite enjoyable, watch it if you like ""The Rock"" but you may get a little bit disappointed if you are expecting something resembles ""The Mummy"", and it's not boring if you are looking for a light action movie.",The Scorpion King
108,RJBose,"The Rock's First Feature, But Who (or Hu) is the Real Star?",8,1 May 2002,"If you want to see a documentary about lifestyles and history of ancient mesopotamia, try the History Channel, or visit your local library; ""The Scorpion King"" loosely adopts this time frame (about 5 thousand years ago) but only as a convenient background for a reasonably entertaining action story featuring the carefully sculpted Rock (with those artfully etched eyebrows).  Sure, we've seen it all before, as the entire movie has been generated, or even cloned, from various standardized stock characters, situations, and even dialogue, but ""The Rock"" acquits himself well, and is a good natured, honorable and generally likable hero.  The effects are good, the action is fast-paced, but the real star of the show is Miss Hu, as the sorceress Cassandra (with a name borrowed from Greek mythology of an era 2000 years later)- she is absolutely gorgeous.The setting of pre-pyramid Egypt was apparently selected simply to fit into the chronology of the Mummy movies, in which the Rock's Scorpion King character was introduced (as an evil force, however, which is never quite reconciled in this film, in which he is the valiant hero).  As noted here, and in previous commentaries, the tribes, costumes and settings seem to have been purchased wholesale from the ""Hercules"" and ""Xena"" wardrobe and prop departments, and represent various anachronistic cultures, technologies and geographic locations. The 21st Century ""politically correct"" ethics are well in force, but they don't get too much in the way of the entertainment.On that subject, it is interesting to note, however, that though a wide variety of ethnic types is represented by the cast: the Rock himself is part polynesian, his ""Akkadian"" brother has made a career of portraying American Indians, Miss Hu is oriental, and Balthazar (another anachronistic borrowed name, this one from the ""Three Wise Men"" of the Bible story), played by Mr. Duncan, is of African-American descent. There is a tribe of ""Amazons"" for the women's rights crowd. (The only real Middle Easterner is the buffoonish stock sidekick for our hero, who is played by that guy who was in ""True Lies"" who was the Arabic speaking computer expert).In this politically correct Hollywood story the true villains must, of course, be caucasion, and, of course in the best Hollywood tradition, the evil king must speak with an English accent,(I think the evil King's Captain of the Guards even had a German accent).  The opening scene shows a clearly Northern European tribe (complete with antler chandeliers, blond hair and bad teeth) proving themselves cruel and barbaric, and thus richly deserving of the thrashing they are soon to receive by an aggrieved Rock. (What a wandering band of pre-Vikings is doing so far from home, or 4,000 years before their time is just the first of many such mysteries the film leaves us to ponder).As I mentioned, these are only minor quibbles.  The most important point is that the movie is never reduced to sniggering sexual innuendo, (although there are several scenes featuring attractive young women in provocative attire), gore (which is ostensibly widespread, but remains off-camera) or off-putting posturing by the Rock.  Miss Hu is radiantly lovely, and very sexy without lewdness; her tryst with the incipient Scorpion King is discreet, even though her outfits seem to all come from the Hittite version of the Victoria's Secrets catalogue.  The Rock proves rather hard to damage, but does not have a sense of smug invincibility which detracts from some films of this type.I think the Rock will have a good chance to claim the mantle of action-hero left by the aging Arnold, Sylvester and Harrison.  Let's hope that his next project gives him something more original to work with.  I'll go see it. As for Miss Hu's next endeavor, I'll see it twice!",The Scorpion King

It starts off as a more or less stock barbarian flick but the action and characterization get progressively better. The Rock has the looks and dry wit of a good action hero. Kelly Hu, as the sorceress, can cast spells for me anytime. Steven Brand is someone I'd prefer to cast as a hero, but his villain is a first class opponent. He's superbly skilled as a warrior and doesn't have a cowardly bone in his body. Unlike some villains who hide behind their henchmen, Brand, as King Memnon, is in the thick of the fight. The growing respect Hu and the Rock have for each other moves the middle section along, and the climax is a fast paced palace infiltration and battle sequence. So The Rock kills Memnon, gets the girl, and ends up as king of Gomorrah. Hope he has good fire insurance. Citizen Kane it ain't, but there are far worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",The Scorpion King

The only good point about the movie apart from the sexy Kelly Hu, is the end, when the rubbish goes off. The music in this film makes it sound like a WWE PPV. If you must watch a Rock movie i'd advise Walking Tall, and Avoid this, but if neither appeal try Welcome to the Jungle.

It was supposed to have been an action adventure movie with some comedy stuff, but it failed to be funny and the complete story was poor.Some scenes in the movie were completely stolen from other movies. One of them was where Mathayus was fired from the catapult, it has been seen in ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"". Another scene was a copy of the Hong Kong-scene in ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" where Indy uses the gong as a shield.I would also like to criticise the use of censorship in this movie. In a movie like this you would expect to see blood, but I didn't see blood even once. It's not that I'm blood thirsty but the movie shouldn't be censored in this way, it's a step backwards for the American film industry. Hollywood could learn a little from the Europeans at this subject or American movies from the 80's.Scorpion King is not a good movie in any way, but there are worse movies on the market, I will rate Scorpion King 4/10.",The Scorpion King

We meet Matayus(The Rock), one of the last person of his race which is known for their excellent assassin skills. The film is about Matayus and other tribes' coming together to fight against evil ruler Memmon who is cruel all tribes on his way and put them under his slavery. Next, we see Matayus and his friends sneaking into the notorious city of Gomorrah and meet a beautiful woman called Cassandra. Their try to lure Memmon out of the Gomorrah fails. Matayus and his friends will have to go back and fight with the devil again.We see Scorpion King as the main and the good character although he was not as nice as in Mummy Returns. Acting in the film is not the best thing and well you shouldn't expect anything above average really. He was good in fight scenes as he is a WWF pro wrestler. That is how he is considered to get people into the movie theaters.Well, it is not a good film. Sometimes, I felt like I was watching a TV programme like Hercules or Xena.

WWF in ancient times, thanks, but I have had enough of WWF, UFC and other people who think fighting is more fun than kissing. If they really think about having another sequel, I will consider not watching it, or maybe just to give it a very low vote :-) I should have known. If Hollywood thinks that something is good , they sue come up with number 2,3,4, etc. In most cases they should have made only 1 or maximum two.

I like action type movies in general & quite liked the two Mummy films, so was waiting to watch this when released on satellite. The action was fairly good, though a bit ridiclous the way whole armies are slain by a few individuals. I mean it is one thing watching a fantasy film like Conan, but quite another when this is supposed to be related to fact (well the place & peoples anyway) The story & acting in these films is never much, but both were below standard, with some of the acting hilariously bad.Now you don't expect complete realism in these films, but like another poster pointed out, where the hell did all these other races appear from. This is supposed to be in Egypt/Mesoptania area, & yet every race on earth seems to be here, including the leading nasty being English. Is their an action film where the leading villian isn't. This also must have been the ancient settlement of Hugh Heffners Playboy ranch, as every female seemed to have silicon implants, & acted like the Stepford Wives.In all fairness I did enjoy the Scorpion King, as it is so bad you have to, though I am glad I didn't pay to watch it at the cinema or bought the video or DVD.",The Scorpion King
119,cglassey,"Great fun, does not require thinking...",8,22 April 2002,"I had a great time at this film. I didn't expect much but I was hoping for a worthy ""action"" film along the lines of ""Conan the Barbarian"". ""The Scorpion King"" is just about as good as that ""old"" classic of swords and adventure. This film is about as fast paced as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", there is never a dull moment. However, it wasn't totally exhausting to watch, there were some moments when you could catch your breath. Is it for kids? It features lots and lots of sword fights but no gore (my thanks to the director). It features quite a number of good looking young women wearing not a whole lot of clothing but no nudes. In fact it looks a great deal like a modern video game (think Jedi Knight but set in 2000 BC). I expect my boys will enjoy this film.As to the actors, based on this film I like ""the Rock"" better than a number of other of so-called ""action stars"" (such as van Damme or Segal). ""The Rock"" could well become the next Schwarzenegger, after all, Arnie wasn't a very good actor when he started but he had a sense of humor. The Rock seems to have a sense of humor too. He seems human, even if he doesn't look very human. Kelly Hu did well and looked great.  Bottom line: good clean fun, promotes violence but what else is new?",The Scorpion King
120,cToTh-2,Whoa!,8,25 April 2002,"If you smell-la-la-la-la-la....what the Rock....is acting!  For this movie, the only thing that may have ""stunk"" may have been the dialogue -- too modern, for my tastes.Overall, this was an excellent action/fantasy flick.  The special effects were well done, the babes were hot and the battle scenes were cool.But like I mentioned above, the dialogue was too modern, using our phrases, slang, etc.  Even Rock's ""Boo"" near the beginning of the movie is modern. We should hear talk of wenching, etc. while sitting in front of a fire eating mutton.Also, for a ruffian/assassin/barbarian, Rock was too clean.  5,000 years ago, people would have been rough and gruff.  But of course, his appearance will attract viewers; how many people will attend a movie starring an unclean, smelly actor?I guess if I'm making a point of the lack of realism in this movie (but then again, how real could this movie be, given that it takes place in a time that very few people know anything about), I guess I might as well mention the weaponry.  Although I know nothing of that era, it just seems odd to me that the swords during that time would be so...perfect.Okay, okay, okay.  It seems as though I'm being nitpicky about the details of this movie, but I'm not.  I have the habit of picking at movies I really like.  And this movie had it all (except not enough magic), including the starring role of the WWF Superstar, the Rock.For the Rock's triumphant achievement, I've given this movie 8 out of 10. It lost a point or two because it did not quite meet my definition of a fantasy/magic-related movie.Oh yes, I consider this movie to be a prequel to the prequel of the Mummy Returns.  In other words, this movie describes the origin of the Scorpion King, but does not portray the events seen in the Mummy Returns.  Does that mean that we may yet see a sequel?  I sure hope so.",The Scorpion King

Oh, and again we see the timeless axiom that muscle-men wear the hairdo's of women! Then there are the desert renegades, whose community resembles the fiefdom of Tina Turner in a Mad Max film. They couldn't get her, so instead they cast a black Rock with even more lithian acting skills and hold on, not really a ""woman's hairdo"" but, another extreme mullet-cut! The plot: predictable.

On paper, I was expecting a great night in, but it didn't quite work out that way.The sets and special effects are all reasonable (but not great) and the acting is passable for a movie of this type. The plot line is the usual fare - good vs evil with sword fights galore.The problem lies in the script and the ineffective characterisation. There was just no reason to feel for the characters and not once did I care what happened to anyone in the movie. Despite repeated attempts to create high drama, it all felt a bit pedestrian and lifeless.Still, I can recommend this movie if you particularly like the genre and fancy something light, but don't expect to be exhilarated, just mildly entertained.",The Scorpion King

A warlord is taking over the land and the titular rock is the assassin hired to stop him but he gets thrown every obstacle imaginable and teams up with a horse thief, a sorceress, and a band of rebels to take down the warlord and restore peace and freedom to the land. The rock wins gets the girl and every action movie cliche is in here, but not callously over done.Okay going in we know it's not meant to be a world changing iconic movie, no it's meant to be fun and it is! The rock is a bad ass all round and the action is acted and direct well enough to feel real and exciting, which helps the bare bones story. This is all supported by decent acting by a good cast of characters that all feel fun and real for a alternate history timeline and due to this the movie has great equality across the board there is a multitude of races in different roles as goes for women as well, so for 2020 it fits in.Also going with that trend of being non offensive the movie does something smart and the rock doesn't try to baby his female counter part but due to a double cross is stand-off like at first, but warms up later on. So no patronizing.But the movie is pretty good fun action flick and is a great rewatch nowadays.",The Scorpion King

She really did not even pass for it. Someone who actually WAS either Arab or Persian would have done better in that role..or even Latina or Italian! But actually, in truth, the movie was a lot of fun. They had good action sequences and battles, the storyline was really not at all gritty and quite easy to follow, and the characters pretty likable. I don't think this movie really was trying to win any awards in the first place. Also, the part where The Rock goes into the harem and is surrounded by concubines reminded me a lot of the Castle Anthrax scene in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (""Bad Zoot!

The film also stars Kelly Hu ( as a psychic ) and Michael Clarke Duncan ( as an African warrior king) and the LOTR star Bernard Hill ( as a potty inventor) . The basic premise is relatively simple, the Rock plays a middle eastern warrior ( the 'Scorpion King', who we briefly saw in the Mummy Returns) who is hired to kill a evil tyrant who is making life a misery for all concerned. The Rock does this with the usual gusto and fiery pyrotechnics one associates with these types of films. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson does have a natural screen presence and warmth that lifts him up from the usual steroidal beefcakes normally found in action -adventure films and he displays a good level of comic timing when sparring with his sidekick ( a mildly irritating whiny low life). His acting is a little clunky at times but given time and experience he should only improve. Kelly Hu could have been given a little more to do than just look hot in near nude outfits especially since she has a black belt in martial arts! shows like Alias and Buffy have proved audiences can accept women as action heroines. Michael Clarke Duncan shows little of his true ability and seems to be there mainly as another man mountain for the Rock to fight.

While he'll never win any Oscars for his acting ability, he is certainly more than adequate for this type of movie, and the sheer fact that you can understand what he is saying gives him far more range than the likes of Arnie or Van Damme will ever have. One other point: watching Kelly Hu as the Sorceress left me with one very important question: At what point would any less clothing on a person be considered naked? I know times have changed when I remember how racy I thought the costumes were in Flash Gordon (mind you, I was ten when I first saw it), but they were postiviely chaste in comparison to Kelly's ancient version of pasties and a g-string!To sum up: If you want a movie which provokes deep thought, go rent Memento.

As for the content of the movie, I though that it was kept real enough so that the ""cheese"" factor never got in the way, but it never took itself too seriously to be ridiculed for incorrectness.  Dwayne Johnson ""The Rock"" did a very good job.  He definitely has a career as an actor and has a warm screen presence.  He's the kind of character you couldn't help but to like. I think his biggest bonus was the fact that he never went over the top with his acting.  It never seemed like he was ""trying"" to act, but that he was just playing the part. My only complaint was this (may contain spoilers):  Considering that this IS a prequel to The Mummy Returns, how did he turn into that hiddeous scorpion creature shown in The Mummy Returns?  Why was he evil in that movie, but a good guy in The Scorpion King?  Even though this was a movie to explain his origin, it never got around to explaining his origin and I was left wondering ""wait a second, what about...""  The only thing I can think of was that he was poisoned by the scorpion venom and the sorcoress said something about ""if he lives, scorpion venom will always run through his veins""  Is that it?

Hardly anyone in the theater even understood the reference to Sodom & GomorahOne thing I found very contradictory was the fact that they were to be the ultimate assassins but he couldn't kill a slave girl or enemy soldier to kill his nemesis.  I'm also sorry to say that a true blood-thristy assassin would not have cared so much about the little orphan boy.Sorry this movie stunk & was clearly predictable.

153,fearfact0,a guilty pleasure in the truest sense,6,29 April 2002,"Have you ever come out of a movie wishing you had your money back, or could at least have only paid for the scenes that paid off in a major way?  that is my opinion of the scorpion king.  for every moment where you groan or look at your watch, there is a scene that will have your jaw on the floor and wanting more more more.  for instance, the first fight scene in the movie was mediocre, and that is saying it lightly.  But the close-up on the rock's face and watching him utter ""boo"" in a low whisper was film brilliance and even though it had its share of groans, it was a great way to start a fun movie.  another example of some good stuff is a battle in a sandstorm, which is edited to death but makes up for it with some impressive action.  The rock isn't the most gifted actor on the planet, but he holds his own and has personality and charisma to spare.  The man is better than even present day Arnold, so there.  not conan, not The mummy, but a decent stand alone (notice the reference to the soundtrack song?) film that has franchise potential.  i gave it a 7",The Scorpion King

This sad attempt to cash in on the franchise has left me feeling that the Mummy and the movies should be buried back up in one of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. What a terrible actor Dwayne Johnson (aka the ""Rock"") really is. They should refer to him as ""The Dud"". Hulk Hogan would have been a better choice to play the ""king""..at least he'd entertain me with his bantering. My first question is, when and where did this take place? For a while I thought they were in Egypt or somewhere in the general geographic area? Then I wondered why everyone resembled white anglo-saxons? Where they in the Germanic regions (seeing that there was way too much vegetation and trees that were not indiginous to the region? Then I was wondering why there was such an ecletic arrangement of costumes, you had ""viking wannabees"", Aztec Indian attire, dispondant poor European, and my personal favorite, the goons were all dressed like the bad guys in Indiana Jones and the temple of doom, come to think of it, those were the same guys from that movie? This movie was extremely painful to watch, with all the predictable plot points, one line gags and typical climatic ending that was so far fetched that I found myself verbally shouting my displeasure in this waste of film. I guess they had to find someone just as pathetic to play the nemesis to the ""Rock"" by picking an a British Actor (who had a British accent) to play the evil King. I loved the fact that the evil King sported a huge Mullet...See this proves that this Redneck hairstyle was popular over 3000 years ago. The goofy sidekick was deserving of a death depicted by the vision of the overly beautfied sorceress, who's acting was as transparent as her ""visions"". Ok, she did have one redeeming quality..the less clothes she wore, the better. By far this film is a complete waste of time to watch, non entertaining, and a waste of money to be sent renting it. If any Movie Producer reads this comment, please do me a favor...DON'T CAST THE ROCK IN ANYTHING ELSE.

If this movie had a storyline, i sure can't remember it.

168,mega_mike,Almost bad enough to be good...almost,4,10 December 2003,"First off, this movie is bad, really bad.  Generic actions sequences, campy attempts at humor, generic effects and a yawn of a story.Also, the backgrounds are very obviously hollywood sets, and the costumes are cheesy and poorly done.  For instance, the wizard princess or whatever is kidnapped naked while taking a bath.  Along the way she grabs a rag off a clothesline to cover herself up, some time later that rag inexplicably becomes a low cut sexy rag dress with high cut slits on the side that covers her oh so perfectly....ok.
Other cheesy things being the amazing mix of ethnicities in an ancient mesopotamian kingdom (british, american, black, asian, hispanic, and arabic(almost forgot)).  I mean, the main villain is british, one of the captains of his troops is Cuban (the dude who gets stabbed at the banquet), his lackey is american and that magic princess is asian.
The thing is, this movie is so bad....its almost good...almost.  This movie was right on the edge and went to neither side.  An example of a movie so poorly made that it is good is the cult classic, Army of Darkness.  The makers of that movie didn't care how bad it looked, and the movie is hilarious for it.  Too bad this movie didn't go that route all the way....",The Scorpion King
169,mystflexagon,one of the greatest films i've ever seen!,10,6 February 2005,"The most recent film from one of my all-time favorite directors, Mr. Charlie Russell. Russell has finally been able to top his magnum opus, Eraser (though the Mask is clearly neck-and-neck) with The Scorpion King. The film stars the Rock in a startling performance I'm sure no one could have saw coming. His Scorpion King is expanded from his brief role in The Mummy Returns to a stately, well-drawn character that stays in our minds and hearts long after the credits have rolled.One of the best aspects of the film is it's lyrical eroticism: skimpy outfits and hair covering breasts, that is titillating yet refined and tasteful. A lot better than the disgusting sex-fest that can be found on the racks of your local Blockbuster Video store.And the action. Oh, where to begin. I get tired just thinking exhilarating action sequences that re-write the book of exhilarating action sequences. Jackie Chan has nothing on the Rock in this film that would make John Woo blush and go back to China. I don't want to say too much, but the catapult sequence is one of the funniest moments in all of cinema history, and believe me I know funny. The White Camel is also quite awesome.In retrospect, I have no choice but to give this film a mighty 10 out of 10. Take it from me, Dan ""The Movie Man"" Wolfson!",The Scorpion King

I can't count the number of wrestling jokes, nor broken stereotypes, nor perfectly-timed goofy slow-motion cuts.  I'm sure that the film was intended to be serious most of the time.  Still, you can see that the cast had a great time making it, and intentional or not, the self-indulgence in the humour was a great alternative to the recent all-too-serious action that has come out lately.

While this may sound like damning it with faint praise, I find this to be a good thing -- its a solid action film which doesn't try to be more than it is.  This is not like the Mega-Macho late 90s Bruckheimer action movies (such as The Rock, Con Air, et al.) in so far as this one takes itself somewhat seriously and is not constantly winking at the audience in a bout of severe irony.  The film is enjoyable and fun, with tons of (mostly) bloodless action, some funny moments, and a decent story for this kind of entertainment.  The Rock plays the hero very well and has all the makings of an action star if he ever wanted to do this full time.

Blend in a touch of magic (old technologies, paranormal, whatever - just to taste), add some ""slashnig"" sequences - and - voilà - you get the movie.Well, it sounds quite simple, but since ""Red Sonja"" I can't remember anything worth watching. Now this is the film: reasonably bad, quite cliché and not very imaginative. Still, it has quite a bit of eye-candy, and, in some sense, it's superior even to the famed ""Gladiator"" as it doesn't pretend to be any more than it is.

It has a special charm to it. The crew of this one, however, just doesn't have the same appeal and was something that I was hoping for the first time I saw this in theaters, but was deeply disappointed. :( And speaking of Conan, the ending is somewhat reminiscent of Conan's where the victor lurks over the kingdom by mountaintop. He did, however, knock his ass into a bowel of fire, which I guess the film theorizes is much more heroic than decapitation anyday. The only difference is that the Scorpion King is met w/ WAY MORE praise than Conan ever was because the Scorpion King never chopped off their master's head in front of him. Of course the masses weren't as brainwashed w/ the king's sorcery neither. More or less, this just happens to be a much more optimistic barbarian knock-off than Conan ever was.My favorite in-joke in this one, so far, was that the witch told the king that she had to remain a virgin in order for her powers to be intact. And she was lying thru her teeth too. That was just too cold! But about halfway into this, I was really skeptical of this chick's awesome. I mean her predictions were only half-right. However throughout half the flick, it makes it seem like she has an uncanny foresight, which is solely responsible for her lord's success.

His guns (okay, arrows) blazing entrance being followed by the opening line of, 'Boo' did not do much to raise my hopes.The usual suspects were all in place - stupid sidekick, beautiful adversary, psychotic adversary, adversaries that become allies, etc. etc.The main annoyance was that the way in which our hero becomes the Scorpion King was changed from The Mummy Returns, and not for the better.

188,jlease-1,Scorpion King-always worth a watch,10,28 November 2007,"Wow, I see this movie has been awash with negative reviews. Look, every movie isn't Citizen Kane. It's an excellent action/adventure/love story all mixed up in one. The Rock is really good in this role, entirely believable. This was his first big role, and he nailed it, which is why he's still starring in movies today. Kelly Hu is an unbelievably beautiful Scorceress who turns into Rock's love interest. Michael Clark Duncan doesn't do his best work here, but it's good enough. The rest of the cast isn't that great, but the movie is really about the Rock and Hu anyways. Great sets, it looks completely authentic and the movie is shot beautifully. There is a reason this gets played a lot on USA, it gets ratings. It gets ratings because it's good entertainment, and shows the Rock on his way to mega stardom. Too bad Kelly Hu hasn't had a chance at a similar vehicle, she's well worth it.",The Scorpion King
189,Earl2000,"What do you think of this movie? ""It doesn't matter what you think!""",6,21 April 2002,"okay...that was a Rock reference SOME of you would have gotten...Anyhow, The Scorpion King is The Rock's debut, and it's not bad. It's not great either. I saw this the same day as I saw the emotionally shattering Iris, so Scorpion King was clearly going to be the lesser quality picture. Yet it does have charms...the humor, although immature and predictable, does amuse on some lowbrow level. Chuck Russell is a good director (The Mask, Eraser, The Blob and Elm Street 3 were all better than they deserved to be), and he keeps the energy flowing throughout most of the movie.The story and supporting characters (wacky sidekick, eccentric inventor, etc) have been done a thousand times before, and that gets in the way of the movie's zippy attitude a number of times.The Rock himself has yet to prove that he is capable of actually delivering a real performance, but he certainly has a presence...as any WWF fan will tell ya. Love him or hate him...you do pay attention.You know, Scorpion King is actually better than The Mummy or it's sequel. It knows when to quit, and doesn't tack on three climaxes too many. Plus it doesn't shove 250-plus digital effects shots down our throat. Scorpion King could actually be considered lowkey filmmaking in comparison!It's not Iris (or even Conan The Barbarian), but you can do a lot worse; you could watch The Mummy Rebandaged!",The Scorpion King
190,JustinK-2,A rollicking adventure that does exactly-what-it-says-on-the-tin,6,29 April 2002,"Well, after all the rumours of its potential demise, the Scorpion King finally arrives on the big screen. The big screen is where it's preferable to see it too since that's where it works best and the look of the film is what's going to make or break it given that it's not going to win any Oscars for intricate or original plotting!But intricate plotting is not what this film is about and I suspect most people who go off to see it won't be looking for it either, so long as the movie hangs together and looks good ... and here I think it succeeds despite a few jarringly over-familiar elements:The mercenary warrior hero (Conan et al)The evil king using a sorcerer to take aid his armies in taking over the world (Sword and the Sorcerer et al)The streetwise kid sidekick (Indian Jones - Temple of Doom et al)The cowardly wisecracking sidekick (Benny from the Mummy films)The flaky, kindly scientist forced to work for the bad guyThe amazon warriors - all good looking and able to find lip glossThe beautiful (and she is very beautiful!) seer, forced into the service of the bad guy, who will lose her powers if she loses her virginity (Solitaire in James Bond Live and Let Die ... even down to being 'tested' after she is suspected of sleeping with the hero!)... all these 'classic' characters (and more) are here. Though I accept that films in this genre, almost by definition, are *bound* to use elements from films that have gone before, in this case by having so many of them they're sometimes mixed a little too thin, when their roles overlap, to actually gel as well as they could.Overall though, the action moves along at a cracking pace, the set pieces look good and are exciting (even if a couple, again, have familiar aspects... haven't we seen the escape behind the large rolling gong before once or twice - Indian Jones Temple of Doom and Jackie Chan - Armour of God for example) and the plot is enough to point the movie in the right direction without there being enough of it to pick too many holes in. Acting wise nobody really stands out but nobody is embarrassing either. The Rock actually does a better job than Arnie did in Conan and is not upstaged by any of the rest of the cast ... on the other hand that sort of lets you know the standard.It's the type of movie it looks like on the poster; if you liked Conan and similar sword slinging fantasy flicks then you'll probably like this one. If you're after intellectual stimulus or great acting go and see something else.6/10",The Scorpion King

I'm sorry if I sound harsh (gee, do I?!) but I was so upset that I wasted $7 in public transit fare to get to the theatre and back.I'm just going to quickly spout off here. 1) The fire ants looked like CGI from the early 90's. Weak! 2) Gratuitous use of everyone's favourite 'Sckhgghtcchh' sound whenever someone gets stabbed. It got tiring after the first few deaths. 3) This movie had absolutely NO innovative ideas whatsoever. I spent the first 5 minutes figuring out how the rest of the movie was going to go. I wasn't far off...Bah! I was hoping that I'd at least be able to laugh at this movie, but it was *so* bad that I sat there, writhing and twisting and groaning in my seat, anxious for the ending.

I am glad that it was decided that the Scorpion King would not be some invincible god-like person. He had some vulnerability to him.   The action scenes were spectacular. More impressive was the fact that Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson performed all of his own stunts. I look forward to seeing him in more movies.    ""Scorpion King: Part II?""",The Scorpion King

I can appreciate that yes, this film is formulaic and unoriginal(I.E. taking the prophetic 'witch' character from 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves' et al, but are people that blind that they cannot see entertainment in its most basic form?
For F**** sake, this is an enjoyable and well choreographed movie, something that harks back to the 80's and before, the Conan type of film, innocent in its projections, and its demands, on the viewer.Can you not see that this is not The Mummy 3?  Yes, its a prequel, but I personally find it a vast improvement on the ghastly Mummy 2(returns)(which was poor), and by that token, disenfranchise it from the series, even though there are many crew and writers that serves all three films.Personally I find this the logical and natutral next step in the (different) progress of the Mummy films.  There is clearly no further room for any more Arnold Vosloo Mummy movies as he now has no further reason for being re-incarnated after 'she' disowned him at the end of ""The Mummy Returns"", a film I found to be tired and boring)so early in the series, too).  (the airship, in 1920/30's?  Turbo powered?  Pigmy mummys? Rubbish!!!To me, The Scorpion King is a natural and enjoyable rout to follow in the series.

It has quite a few humorous moments. The special effects are excellent. The cinematography was very well done. While I am NOT a fan of wrestling, The Rock gives a better performance here than Schwarzenegger did in those abysmal Conan(tm) films back in the early '80's (must have been all those years in the WWF). Kelly Hu (Surf Ninjas) does a good turn as the seer. Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile) also turns in a good performance as the rebel Balthazar. The fight choreography was very well done. The only REAL gripe I have with this film was its one MAJOR anachronism: the use of steel in an age BEFORE the pyramids, which was the BRONZE Age. Other than that, I was not disappointed in the movie. That it could have been better goes without saying, but it wasn't all THAT bad.",The Scorpion King

So when I came out, I was actually satisfied.  The Rock didn't make a fool of himself, the action was cool, there were some nice women, and some jokes.  The perfect movie formula for a man wanting to kick back and be entertained. 
The Rock has definitely succeeded in making the best movie ever for a wrestler.

This all spells The Scorpion King, the story of the Scorpion King that appeared in The Mummy Returns. It is before the pyramids, and there is Chinese gunpowder! Where does that come from? I have to say, this film historically is totally inaccurate, but who cares? We don't want a great thinking movie like A Beautiful Mind. As long as it has extreme action, we're all going to see it! The action in this film is really good. It made the movie worth seeing if you could turn off your brain. It was also campy too. It was so enjoyable. I saw it with my friends after two minutes, we turned it into an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3000. Making fun of the movie made it also worth watching. Making up jokes about the main character who is an Acadian and pretending he was a Canadian, jokes about the unrealistic situations and action, saying the villan looked like Russel Crowe, and much much more!

The Rock is great as a mass of muscle, but he should say less at this start of his film career, like Conan the Barbarian. About the fighting, too many closeups, not enough expansive scenes, and too much punching and kicking.  Come on, hands and feet are no match for swords. Also, there wasn't any magic or magical creatures which made the Mummy and Mummy Returns decent.  The environment looks too much taken from a Hercules or Xena tv show - costumes and setting need some work. The comedy doesn't work as well in the first two Mummies either.

203,hanfuzzy,Missing epic scenes,3,7 May 2002,"Well, I had to see this, just to see what is being done in the Sword & Sorcery genre these days, and because I loved the Mummy I & II. I think this movie had a lot of potential which it just did not live up to. (The movies I compare it to are Conan and the Mummys.) First of all, I didn't like the soundtrack, as it was too modern. I think a more ancient-style soundtrack, like in Conan, would have better served the mood. Not weak, just orchestral rather than electric guitars. Secondly, I think that in a series that previously had so much focus on magic, this movie was sadly lacking in magical events (spells, creatures, weapons, etc.). Although parts took place in a desert, there were not really any Egyptian-style cultural ties, which I missed. Finally, and most disappointingly, there was a lack of the kind of epic scale that could have made the story seem more important. Although Memnon is played as a kind of Alexander or Attila, we never see more than a few dozen soldiers. Did they not have the budget to even have one scene like the battle flashback in the Mummy II (or the one in Fellowship of the Ring)? The villain doesn't seem very threatening without an army, and the refugees don't garner much pity since we don't see much of the misery we assume has been inflicted on them. Much of what I was expecting to see in this film simply wasn't there.",The Scorpion King
204,roger_for_nntp,Not a patch on Conan,4,21 April 2002,"[The following review contains some mild spoilers, but frankly there's not much to spoil since the whole plot is a rehash of movies you've seen before. If you can't describe all the main points of the plot BEFORE EVEN SEEING ONE SECOND OF FILM, we'd like to know if your Amish friends have any nice quilts to sell.]With the lead actor coming from the WWF wrestling thing, I don't know what I should have expected really, but I went to see ""the Scorpion King"" anyway. I suppose basically I have a weakness for Conan - which fascinated me in my youth when I discovered the allusions to the life of Temujin Genghis Khan - and I was hoping to see some Conanesque swashbuckling. However apart from muscular men striking poses with swords in front of scantily clad women, this was no Conan.True, it throws more than one sop to Conan, with a plotline that is taken almost intact from the second half of ""Conan the Barbarian"" (and numerous similar movies through the ages); the formation of a remarkably similar party of adventurers; and Mathyas/Conan being wounded, left to die, and saved, in remarkably similar ways. But then, it also has plenty of sops for actual WWF fans. (Well, it even has a bit from Ulysses for those of a more classical bent.)However Conan, at least, was fairly free of glaring anachronisms, and those anachronisms it did have were subtle enough to offend only the eye of the scholar, and even then could be excused by the fact that Conan is (arguably, possibly) set in a fictitious world at an indefinite time.Not so Scorpion King. We know roughly where Scorpion King is set, and we know roughly when. In fact, the hero is explicitly stated to be an Akkadian [1] shortly after the fall of that empire (in 1950 BC), and much of the action is set in Gomorrah [2], which is presumably somewhere in the Levant and generally believed to have been destroyed somewhere around the same time. And the anachronisms are absolutely agonising even to one scratching to remember his high school history. Here we are in the Bronze Age, and we have steel. Not just a little bit of meteoric iron here and there, but practically every non-golden metal object is steel, and it's cheap enough to throw away. Swords are not only highly polished steel longswords, but a few are even straight bladed, cross-hilted crusader longswords, some three thousand years before their time. As if that's not enough we have telescopes some three thousand five hundred years before their time (and not just any telescope, but a variable power one), distilled spirits some three thousand two hundred years before distillation, crossbows around twenty nine centuries too early, chainmail similarly, a ""scientist"" (yes they use that word) busily inventing a Roman catapult only about seventeen centuries too early this time, and finally, God Forbid, gunpowder.Yes, we are in the ancient Near East, and we have gunpowder. I kid you not. But it's supposed to be ok because we got the recipe from China. Never mind that we are some four hundred years before the first traces of civilisation in China - yes, China is old, but it isn't old enough to make this story work. We also meet some Japanese sword masters giving lessons with a shinai, a mere thousand years before the first vestiges of civilisation reached Japan and once again roughly three thousand years before katana (and presumably shinai) were invented. Oh, and finally (well, finally from what I spotted without even trying) there is nary a chariot to be seen, because everyone (apart from Mathyas on his camel) gets about on horseback - complete with stirrups (and the wagons are drawn by horses, too!). That goes nicely with the crusader longswords, I suppose.However, it is by no means only the anachronisms that grate in this awful movie. The acting is straight out of ""the A-team"", and it says something that ""the Rock""'s performance is actually one of the better ones. We are even treated to a bout of WWF style wrestling - the sort where men are only lightly stunned after being repeatedly struck over the head by objects hard enough to crack your skull. The characters, by and large, are poorly developed and unsympathetic:The thief character seems to have been added simply because Conan had a roguish sidekick. But Conan's sidekick was played for comic relief; Mathyas' sidekick is just stupid, getting one interesting scene where he rescues Mathyas from a grisly death, and then ever afterward doing absolutely nothing either for the plot or for laughs. Well, there's a couple of bits that perhaps were meant to be funny, but they are pretty damn weak. Like him standing at the bottom of a shaft as others thrown down bags of gunpowder. Two are thrown at once, knocking him down. ""One at a time"", he whines. Guffaw. Chortle. Snigger. What a maroon.Memnon is meant to be the evil bad guy, and Mathyas is the hero. But the moral distinction between their characters is so slight it is difficult to see why we are supposed to see any difference between them. Indeed, it seems to me there are just two incidents, without which it would be just as easy to ""root"" for Memnon and think the climax was a tragedy. You see, Mathyas is a king who is conquering the quarrelling neighbouring tribes. This is supposed to be the black mark against his name, even though he believes he is ultimately creating a better world by suppressing the chaos and internecine strife that has plagued the land. Mathyas, on the other hand, is an assassin, a cold blooded killer who murders for money. He's the good guy, y'see? Now I actually got halfway through the movie repeatedly thinking ""Isn't 'the Rock' meant to be the good guy?"" before something occurred to (very mildly) differentiate their characters: Mathyas misses a shot at his target to save a boy who helped him, and who is in trouble because of Mathyas, while Memnon casually kills a lieutenant who is undermining his authority. Oh, and Memnon also accepts the service of a patricide. That's about the limit of their moral distinction; otherwise they are both cruel men of violence, with Memnon's motivation arguably slightly nobler! Oh, and then there's the princess who wants to flee a life of luxury with Memnon to the wilderness, but why? At one point, Memnon says ""you think I'm cruel, don't you?"", but no explanation is given for her holding this belief. Then she meets Mathyas, who is scarcely less cruel, and jumps in the sack with him.Next on the list of gripes are plot holes and non sequiturs. For example, at one point Mathyas is captured and many hours afterward escapes - and immediately, mere feet away, finds his camel with all his (numerous) weapons untouched and complete with a treasure he was to be paid for the assassination. Umm, how come the guards didn't take this stuff? Then there's the fighting prowess of the princess. We are given to understand that she has led a cosseted life, so it is no surprise when, with a dagger, she is barely able to nick Mathyas' arm. But only a few days later she is wielding a longsword nearly as long as herself, and effortlessly cutting down the elite personal bodyguard of the greatest swordsman on earth! When we require a deus-ex-machina to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, we blow up the foundations of the palace (conveniently accessible from the street) with the scientist's gunpowder - creating a rolling Hollywood fireball which incinerates every bad guy in its path whilst missing good guys only twenty feet from ground zero, and happily causing Memnon to fall to his death. But the next day the palace is apparently undamaged! Then there's Mathyas' wound. SOMEWHAT STRONGER SPOILER He gets a high lung shot in the back with a broadhead arrow, and quite reasonably drops like a rock (the Rock?). He should be flopping about like a gutted fish, with two or three minutes till he dies. Even if someone in 2000 BC knows enough first aid to stop that lung collapsing, without access to a major surgical hospital and heaps of antibiotics, he will be dead in a day. But - and you KNOW there's a but! - after lying on the verge of death for a few seconds, he decides it isn't so bad after all, gets up, reaches behind his back to pull out the arrow (how the hell does that work!?), and proceeds to slay his foes, etc . The next day he's up bright and early, full of smiles. No explanation, no justification, no dunking in the River Styx, no ""oh, I don't have a lung on that side; born without it, and it's never bothered me!"". Nope; he's just plain immortal. What a load of horse puckey. END SPOILERA couple of miscellaneous bits: You're a king commanding vast armies, and your bride-to-be - who happens also to be instrumental in your military and political power - has just been abducted by a skilled assassin, and taken who knows where. How many guys would you send after her? Five hundred? Ten thousand? No, how about _twelve_?Scorpion venom just isn't that toxic. For an adult, it's very painful, but not life threatening. Some very large scorpions have occasionally killed a very small child, but even that's unusual.The Amazon warriors.  For no apparent reason or explanation we suddenly get a cartload of amazons who easily slaughter the elite bodyguard once again. Maybe their marketing people told them they'd be getting a few Xena fans along.The gunpowder seems to have been a deus-ex-machina to justify the good guys winning, since they were basically royally screwed (even if the king was dead, if you pardon the imagery), when the vastly superior opposition just surrenders and declares the outlaw bandit to be their king. Huh? Why?Footnotes: ==========>1. Well, actually he's somewhat black - Samoan ISTR - which Akkadians weren't, but we can just gloss over that bit. And the bit about his ""brother"" being an Amerindian who bears him as much resemblance as chalk does to cheese. But then the Gomorran princess appears to be Chinese, so it seems to be the politically correct thing to totally disregard human phenotypes. 2. Although they do seem to flit around quite a bit with remarkable Jet Age speed, ranging from snow covered pine forests (Turkey?) to a desert much harsher than any in the Levant. (Since Mathyas rides an Arabian camel - unknown outside Arabia until the Romans started importing them for service in North Africa - and describes this desert as ""home"", it is presumably Arabia. Odd that an Arabian should have been comfortable shirtless in the snow... Incidentally, this desert is named ""Death Valley"", and it appears to me that it in fact actually _is_ Death Valley, Mojave Desert, California...)",The Scorpion King
205,Aragorn22,"Disappointing plot, (under) average acting, though amusing (5/10)",5,26 May 2002,"The Scorpion King is to be seen as a sideway of the plot of The Mummy Returns. It's about an Akkadian guy (the Rock) who saved rebellions from the evil ruler Memnon. When you hear this story you could think it´s a very interesting plot, but as you see the movie, you learn that there's really nothing really more about this story then the facts above. I'm sorry, but that's just not enough to make a good movie! The biggest disappointment about the movie came when I found out how he gets to be called the Scorpion King: he gets hit with scorpion venom, and he survives. He gets called a scorpion king just for surviving the venom (and have scorpion's blood flooding in his body for the rest of his life). Again: it's just too simple man! The acting in this movie isn't very good either: The Rock doesn't speak very much in the movie, and we can all see why: he just can't act. The rest of the actor's performances is nothing more then average. So, we have a really disappointing story outline plus we have bad to average acting. But why though did I enjoy myself watching the movie? Yes, I was entertained and I did have enough fun watching the movie. Well, I think it's because it is a entertaining movie: It has many good action, much humor and some good pictures. So, in sum, if you just see The Scorpion King as an entertaining movie, you could have a fun evening. But don'tand really don't expect to see a movie with good acting, a good plot and unpredictability. As to be entertained is just not enough for a movie to get a good grade from me, I give this movie a 5 out of 10.

206,megadoomer,Good movie for any action fan,7,22 February 2004,"This movie was loaned to me by a friend who didn't think too highly of it herself, but I really liked it.  Any fan of action movies in general should give this one a chance.  I found a lot of the fighting to be pretty good, especially for a Hollywood movie.  The movie opens with a fight scene that I thought was pretty high grade.  The writing really isn't that great, but the movie keeps moving along at a pretty good pace.  I don't think that it detracts too much from the overall experience.  I did find the included sidekick/comic relief character to be really annoying, though, not to mention unnecessary.  From what I've seen of him, the Rock can do comedy.  Letting him take care of comic relief himself would also have served to give a little more depth to his character, who is pretty one-dimensional, but he does have a few funny moments in which to shine.  This movie doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and it's all the better for it.

The acting was horrible, the attempts at humor were disgusting and the battle scene were just plain bad. The only halfway decent actor in this movie was the woman who played princess!!!! And just so you know, it is supposed an action movie with a touch of humor, not a comedy. I do not like Dwayne Johnson's acting at all but the others managed to be even worse. The stunts were very, very bad; they were poorly staged and badly executed. The parts that were supposed to be serious were just plain funny and the funny parts were awkward.

This movie is great as he remains the last surviving Arcadian after many years of battle with his arch Nemesis. In the end, the rise of this skilled Arcadian assassin bring the Arcadian back from the dead and unite good to overtake the power of evil in the dark ages of the world.

210,johnh-15,Did I pay to see this?,5,21 April 2002,"I'm ashamed totally ashamed to say that I actually paid to see this movie. This is one of those movies where you are either hung over, sick or just veggin on the couch and there isn't anything else to watch....Don't waste your money seeing it in the theater.....I wouldnt even waste the money to rent it.",The Scorpion King
211,BDB116,"Not terrible, but certainly not great either.",5,17 April 2002,"I'll stick to the middle of the road on this one.  I saw the sneak preview last night, and went in expecting VERY little.  I got just a tad more than that.  It isn't going to win awards.  It's pretty clear by the storyline the writers didn't put too much time into writing it.  The formula has been used a million times, and will likely be used a million times more - A good enough bad guy sees the light and decides to take on the evil bad guy. There is a funny sidekick, a beautiful woman, a bad guy that ends up being good, and a traitor (who looks and sounds surprisingly like Tom Cruise).
Scorpion King REEKS of the Conan movies.  And it was about as good as the Conan movies.  The Rock wasn't too bad, his acting was a tad bit better than I anticipated.  The action was enough to keep me awake, & the one liners were flowing throughout the movie.  The crowd seemed into the movie, although alot of comments leaving the theater were about the same as my wife's ""not good at all"".  I've given it a 5, but I may be a tad generous on that one.  It will be good enough to bank some BIG box office numbers, with a steep decline in the 2nd and 3rd weeks.  Should finish at roughly 80-100M. If the Millions....and millions of rock's fans show up, that is.  Go into it expecting very little, turn off your brain for 90 minutes, and bring along with you your ""suspension of disbelief"" and you'll be just fine. Hey, it's better than ""the Musketeer""...",The Scorpion King
212,salnkent,"Not Bad. Hey, what did you expect, any way?",7,20 April 2002,"Yeah, the movie's a spinoff (though a person who hadn't seen any of the Mummy movies would have been able to follow it.) Yeah, the Rock's no heavy-duty actor (yet.) Yeah, this was Sword-and-Sorcery with about as much substance as tissue paper.  So what?  Like Joel Siegel, I kept some perspective on the process.  So what if it was a 'franchise spinoff.'  Did it deliver the goods?  Yes, very well.  You go to this movie for 90 minutes or so of rompin' stompin' action and the good guy saving the day...and that's precisely what you get. I have some complaints.  Obviously they were really watching the budget - the CGI graphics were painfully poor.  But the sets and scenery were really pretty decent, the story line had enough twists and turns to keep you interested (yet it didn't have all that many glaring holes, surprise surprise) and (unlike Hulk Hogan) there were very few references to the Rock's wrestling persona.  Now, on to Dwayne Johnson's (the Rock's real name) performance. In real life, it would appear the Rock is a decent guy.  His interviews are always straightforward, and he's had some good moments in both interviews and guest appearances. He's evidently pretty smart, and his wrestling persona is the most 'electrifying' to hit pro wrestling in years.  (As you might guess, I'm a fan.) But I said I was going to review his performance.  Okay, here goes: on a one-to-ten scale, I'd give him a 6.8 - he's a rookie, so I cut him some slack. But if you simply allow a little bit for the script and concept itself, the Rock acquitted himself quite well.  He certainly showed as much depth as Schwartzenegger did in the Original Conan movie, and I think he'd compare favorably to Stallone in his debut in 'The Lords of Flatbush.'  As a former College/Pro football player, the Rock is big into the 'team' concept. In that regard, I saw him trying to put his performance on a par with Kelly Hu and Michael Clarke Duncan (neither of which turned in anything particularly bad, or particularly outstanding...c'mon!) I sometimes think critics really do go into some movies with their minds already made up.  I think the Rock's performance surprisingly good for a Rookie effort. If he wants to become the next action hero, he needs coaching, true.  But I think the potential is there.  As for the movie as a whole?  If you like mindless action-adventure, it rates about a 7.1.  I predict this movie will do well, if not spectacular.  Just keep your head in the right place, and you'll enjoy it.",The Scorpion King
213,nuwan_wel,Don't be too critical!!!!,7,16 April 2008,"It amazes me that most of the user comments of this movie tend to fall into the not to bad but not to good category. I admit to a certain extent that maybe the case. What I believe many commentators fail to realise the type of movie this is? Yes we have seen the same plot in a number of different movies - you know the hero taking revenge on someone for killing their family members etc (this of course is the basis for most superhero origin movies as if that is the only thing the male psyche can relate to). But for this movie the plot device that propels our unsung hero The Scorpion King (The Rock in his first major role) actually works. (If you want more plot details read some of the other user comments) The Scorpion King could be taken as a cross between Conan and Indiana Jones. Swords and sandals with one death defying scrape after another. I mean the hero using a large brass gong to escape the guards is a direct nod to a similar scene in The Temple of Doom. For the type of movie that it is - a no brainer action flick enjoyed with other guys over a six pack and pizza - it actually delivers.From the very opening sequence where the heroes brother has been held hostage to final battle with memnon it is wall to wall action by the Rock as he tears apart everything and anything on screen. If you enjoy it at this level then you will not be disappointed. If you want something more serious and along the same vain then the original Conan the Barbarian with Arnold and directed by the superb John Milius will be your cup of tea.However, the Rock, in his first role, establishes himself as the new action star of the 21st century easily taking over Arnies mantle from the 80's. His acting maybe not that great but when he starts bruising heads the Rock is poetry in motion. And what is even more superb is that no swearing was needed to generate a rollicking good, if kinda shallow, adventure.So check your brain at the door and just indulge in the senseless adventure that is The Scorpion King. Hears hoping the follow-up (without The Rock) will be just as incredibly fulfilling in a shallow way!",The Scorpion King
214,Leon_Chang_2000,What's so bad about it?,6,13 August 2004,"I understand how a lot of people are easily disappointed when movies coming out are all the same, with a bunch of good guys fighting a bunch of bad guys, and of course the good guys win, but there really aren't that many movies like that, without something new.In this movie, the only thing that people can attack is that it is too average, that they've seen this kind of movie millions of times. But this it isn't that bad. On the plus side, there was plenty of action, and more plot than almost any two World War 2 movies have put together. The acting was pretty natural, and the lighting isn't bad enough to be the main point of an argument.Of course, like about 99.99% of all movies, there are bad sides to this movie, like the predictability and the similarity between its sword fights.Overall, it's decidedly better than a good percentage of other movies, and I think that it deserves better than a 5 or 6. I gave it a 7 out of 10.",The Scorpion King
215,troyparsons,Come me Rock you can do better,2,19 November 2021,"3 minutes in and I'm turning this off. What is this farce? Absolute over the top nonsense. Let's start the movie with the Rock carrying a rock. That's funny, right?He fires an arrow and suddenly bad guys go flying through the air. He says ""boo"" and they all run off in fear (yet 10 seconds earlier they were being portrayed as fearless warriors).Why is there heavy metal music in Egyptian times?If Dwayne Johnson plays the same character from the last movie, why isn't he part Scorpion? Isn't that the title of the movie? I don't even want to watch to find out if he transforms, the whole thing is too stupid. I thought the previous movie was bad, this is worse.",The Scorpion King
216,moviebuf-31,The Rock rocks! Great movie!,10,22 April 2002,"For those of you who give this movie a negative review, bite me!  The Scorpion King is a lot of fun, and stands totally on its own.  It is entertaining, and not to be over-analyzed.  The Scorpion King himself is turned into a hero and romantic swashbuckling figure in this movie, and far outshines his introduction in The Mummy Returns.  It is reminiscent of Arnold in his heyday as Conan.  There is a human aspect to these actors, that make them endearing to movie-goers.  They are not overly rehearsed in their deliveries, which make them more natural.  After all, this is an action movie, with very little down time - it keeps you watching from beginning to end. I don't want to spoil the storyline since the movie just finished it's opening weekend, so I'll merely say - go see it if you want to enjoy a night at the movies!  It's fun, and there's nothing to be embarrassed about - no horrible gore, no cursing, no real love scenes but enough to be implied, and therefore you can let your imagination rule which is rare in these days.  I predict that Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock - will be a new heartthrob for many ladies, and for the guys, Kelly Hu isn't bad on the eyes either.  I spent half the movie wondering if The Scorpion King's nemesis was Russell Crowe or not - he is a dead ringer.  Recommendation: go see The Scorpion King - and enjoy!  You can put it on the shelf with Raiders of the Lost Ark, Conan, Star Wars, and all those other great SciFi movies.",The Scorpion King
217,santo316,Better than the mummy,7,21 April 2002,"This movie is no Oscar winner but it was Fun. this movie is much better than both of the mummy movies.

218,superpotts,good action flick,7,22 April 2003,"There will be many people who don't like this movie because it's corny, bad dialogue, poor special effects, blah blah blah. The bottom line is, though, that if you're wanting a good mindless action flick, then this is a great pick.  It's not filled with Oscar-level acting, writing, and directing, but then it wasn't meant to be either.  It's meant to be fun and give the viewer a chance to simply vegetate while being entertained at the same time; and it's this purpose that the movie fulfills greatly. It doesn't have some of the ""depth"" of the Mummy movies, it's just straight action. I would say that this is a flaw only because I've seen what it could be with the DVD special features.  There's a whole prophecy storyline that they left out of the theatrical release that really would have added a lot to the movie; I'm not real sure why they took it out.  In any case, if you like action movies, and if you're not a critic who exists soley to bash movies rather than to enjoy them, and especially if you like The Rock, then I would recommend Scorpion King.",The Scorpion King
219,cpnlishang,I want my $10 back!,3,22 April 2002,"Can I please have a refund? Well I'll admit that I already walked into the movie not expecting much (based on watching the Mummy and Mummy 2), and walking out still unsatisfied doesn't say much for this film.The movie did pull in a few chuckles here and there, pulling in the same type of corny humor from Brendan Frasier's troupe. But overall, the script was very weak, and the choreography was only slightly better than Hercules/Xena fighting. Then again, we can't expect much from just a wrestler and an all-evil guy who only learned his moves shortly before the movie was filmed.Of all of the actors, why didn't we see more of Kelly Hu flexing her martial arts knowledge (well, as much as she can deliver?). She has had experience on Martial Law with Sammo Hung, plus she mentioned in a recent interview that she is currently studying a particular form of martial arts now. Maybe I've been spoiled by all of the kung fu movies I've seen with Jet Li! It's like drinking instant coffee after knowing what coffee in Europe tastes like. Now that America is experiencing more and more kung fu movies in recent years, these monster box office movies have to bring their fighting choreography up to par.All in all, I feel that after it's big opening weekend, we will see a quick die-out in the box office in latter weeks.3 out of 10 stars.",The Scorpion King
220,audby,"You're better off renting ""Conan""...",1,19 April 2002,"I admit, I'm a fan of The Rock, and that's why I went to see ""The Scorpion King.""  I know now that I should have gone to the matinee showing.  No, better yet, I should have stayed home and given myself a root canal with my Makita cordless.I had the feeling from the trailer that the film was going to be a campy, B-grade romp, and I love B-grade flicks -- my VHS cabinet at home is blessed with titles such as ""Wing Commander,"" ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes,"" ""Krull,"" and ""The Fifth Element.""  However, the plot in Scorpion King was so thin, the dialogue so shallow, and the acting (and directing) were so poor, that even I found the movie to be objectionable.  Only the addition of fire ants to my movie theater seat could have made me hate that experience more.
The film has been aimed squarely at the 11-year-old boys of our nation. Anyone younger than that shouldn't be exposed to the (bloodless) violence, and anyone older than that will hate the empty dialogue and putrid script. The entire movie is one long string of PlayStation-esque fight scenes sewn together with an extremely feeble thread (which the writers, in their best attempt at humor, call a ""storyline"") that does not do justice to the reasonably well put together movies also in this franchise (""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"").  The Rock, who does honestly have some acting ability, tries hard to keep the film engaging, but the vapid performances of those around him remind me of the barrel full of discarded toy parts in ""Toy Story 2"" as they reach up and drag Woody down into oblivion.I understand now why the trailer for this movie was set to the theme music from ""Conan the Barbarian"" -- this movies wants desperately to be a classic fantasy film just as that one was. Take my advice:  Take the $8.50 you'll shell out on ""The Scorpion King"" and use it to rent ""Conan the Barbarian,"" ""Gladiator,"" and one of those movies from the adult section (since you'll be missing all the bikini-clad women hanging around in The Rock's world).  Then go home and enjoy some true Hollywood entertainment.",The Scorpion King
221,bndalton,The Rock's Conan,6,19 May 2002,"While watching this nonstop action film, starring world famous wrestler The Rock, one can't help but think of the parallels to Arnold Swarzenegger as Conan. The Rock is a capable, charismatic leading man for this genre. Like Arnold, though, he is at his weakest when speaking lines of dialogue of more than five words at a time. As for the movie, the plot is paper thin. It's little more than an excuse for nonstop fighting, an occasional joke, and beautiful women, aka Baywatch. Although surprisingly violent, it cuts away from what would be a plethora of gore and a flood of blood if the movie strived for any realism at all, which much like the World Wrestling Federation, it doesn't. Rock has the stuff to be the next action superstar, but he's going to have to do two things first. He needs to find a vehicle that will make his cartoony persona more dark, much the same way Arnold was able to add a dark edge in Terminator. Plus, how can you take anyone seriously that calls himself The Rock - he needs to find a leading actor type name and fast. Or he will be stuck between a rock and hard place finding movies beyond The Scorpion King 1 through 100. Overall, I enjoyed this movie, despite its lack of a plot or spectacular special effects, for what it was, which speaks volumes for the Rock's ability to carry a film. However, my 11 year old daughter was bored.",The Scorpion King

I watched it and yes it was loud and dumb but it was also a lot of fun. The Rock stars as the Scorpion King who prefers a camel over a horse-because camels are smarter! (it's a good thing that Trigger did not hear that).The plot doesn't really matter-there is enough violence,one-liners, and woman to keep most men happy.  Any movie that has its star escape by using a catapult that launches him into a brothel is all right by me.If you like the over-the-top grade B movies like Anaconda, you will like the Scorpion King.9 out of 10",The Scorpion King

It had wonderful sets and settings, funny characters, and minute after minute of heart pounding action! Now I'm not a fan of The Rock or wrestling for that matter, but he did extremely well. He shouldn't be compared to Arnie, rather an actor on his own. He was a fun guy to root for. The story is set in Egypt and the surrounding lands in the time before the pyramids (I think in The Mummy Returns they said about 6000 years ago?). Mathayus (The Rock) is an Acadian, the last of a tribe of deadly assassins, who is hired to kill the sorceror (who turns out to be a sorceress). He learns he is betrayed and instead of killing her takes her with him. Although a bad guy in ""Returns"", The Scorpion King plays a good guy in this film. Maybe they will make another film showing how he goes down the path to evil (ala Star Wars). This movie was extremely well made concidering it came out ELEVEN MONTHS after ""Returns"".

The previews didn't promise anything more and it delivers just what it promised. The director and executive producer (who just happens to be Vince McMahon, the Rock's boss on the WWF) sculpted the movie around the Rock. Since it was his first leading role they wanted to make it easier for him to adjust to the big screen. They applied some of the concepts of the World Wrestling Federation to the movie. That is why the movie is so very action oriented with small bits of story and character development inbetween. The fans of the Rock will more than likely enjoy this film, while the casual movie watcher may not find it chessy and over acted. At any rate I give this film a 7 out of 10, it was a very impressive first outing for the Rock as a leading man but, nothing special to add to the action genre.",The Scorpion King

Vince McMahon's presence in the production line up ensured a high dose of soft-core titillating stuff from the Sorceress Kelly Ho, who was more like Kelly Electric Blue. She looked good sans make up but ordinary with make up on. The cinematography of movie was pretty decent except for the ants scene which looked ridiculously animated.

He hates the human race even more than Adolf Hitler! And he possesses a vast army under his command (much greater that the Persian Army in ""300""!... Uuuuuuuhh, be afraid! Be very afraid! Nobody will be able to stop him!... Nobody except that strong, handsome(?), courageous and mighty warrior, the Scorpion King *ta-da!*) ...STOP COPYING STORIES!!!2. Recycled characters (does an overly muscled half-naked warrior destroying everything in his path sound familiar? How about a beautiful sorceress who falls in love with the previous one? A treacherous thief that can't prevent himself from lying every time he opens his mouth? An annoying little kid that steals a precious stone from the movies's hero? And a mad scientist that discovers powder years before the Chinese do?...) CREATE NEW CHARACTERS, PLEASE!!!3. Bad acting (Everybody sucked big time and I can't believe Michael Clarke Duncan is the same guy from ""The Green Mile"". In some scenes, it seemed like I was watching children play at kindergarten. Ugh!) IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO FIND AVERAGE ACTORS FOR AVERAGE ROLES???4. Lousy special effects (some explosions looked like fireworks, the deaths of some of the bad guys reminded me of ""Bonanza"" and I can't find words to describe that quick sands in that cave... too bad to laugh!)

229,rochvelleth,"Bad film, don't watch it.",2,6 August 2006,"The Scorpion King is an awful film. Don't watch it, it's bad. Not good. Really, really bad.I don't mean it's bad for the lack of any kind of historical/factual/atmospheric accuracy (it was in many ways like Xena/Hercules, only bad). I mean it's bad for the lack of convincing plot, the wooden acting of the Rock, the fight scenes (a cross between wrestling moves and something even sillier), the ineffectual characters... Not good in any respect. The bad guy was dressed head to toe in black leather, and that should have been at least menacing and maybe sexy, but he failed spectacularly to be evil or appealing in any way whatsoever.The best thing about it was the presence of Bernard Hill as a mad inventor, as exemplified by the following exchange:Hero guy: (bursts into mad inventor's place through door, closes it behind him because he is being pursued by guards) How do I get out of here? Mad inventor: Through that door.This was the only *intentionally* funny line in the film. However, I was continually amused by the pop culture references - there were pseudo-quotes from things like Indiana Jones, and I'm sure I saw a Star Wars reference somewhere... The biggest attraction, if it is one, is that being filmed in the style of Xena (complete with busty harem girls, unrealistic fighting moves, American accents... but without the depth) - it gave it an almost-charm. I decided it should be renamed 'Up the Pyramid' - though note that there were no pyramids in the making of this motion picture, since it was all set before the pyramids.

But in the end, I decided that I had to go see it for the fact that one of my role models, Stephen Sommers wrote it.I liked most of the writing and the action in the movie was pretty good. One of my favorite scenes is during the sandstorm. But Dwayne Johnson is not an actor he is only a actor in the action sense of acting. I also did not like how they tried to  make the music sound somewhat like the music from The Mummy movies. Lastly, I was dissapointed that there was nothing on the fall of the scorpion king or on how he was known as the scorpian king except for one small and brief part.

I compare it with those Xena or Hercules TV Series where at least you don`t have to pay for. All right the special effects were nice and OK but how about the acting ? Horrible, does wrestling automatically qualify you as an actor or even worse do you think it`ll make you a good one ? Even Dolph Lundgren, Jean Claude van Damme or Michael Dudikoff are better actors than The Rock and they often suffer through a plot that is much worse than this one.

It's all the weird people and things around him that make the scenes funny, witty, and entertaining. The fire ant scene was hilarious and reminded me of the antics in the later Evil Dead movies.The climax of the film with three different things going on at once is top-notch. I wish Spiderman had as climactic a scene as this.I was not a Rock fan before I saw this movie, but now I see how guys and girls would like this man.

236,ssunzhong,A 2-hour long wrestling match.,1,27 March 2005,"I came into watching the Scorpion King with some expectation. After all, it DID hail as the prequel to the recent Mummy movies, which were personal favorites of mine. Not only that, it included two names that I have regarded with favor: Bernard Hill, and Kelly Hu. Both fine actors, but neither one could save this 2-hour long wrestling match from stinking like cowsh!t. Especially with the Rock at the helm.This movie reeks with clichés; everything from plot to characters (EVEN TO THE ACTION SCENES!) seemed ripped straight from the Handbook of Hollywood Clichés. There's the muscle-bound and initially uncaring hero who miraculously decides to help the people in less than a week, there's the ultra-hot slave-girl/sorceress that we first thought was bad but who was really good, there's the eccentric old wizard type, there's the tyrannical villain, and then there's the cowardly and humorous sidekick. Good god! I'd be hard pressed to find any trace of actual WRITING in the script. I could type up something better than that with my eyes closed in ten minutes! If a movie's plot was a human body, than this one is nothing but a bare skeleton; an excuse to hang on bimbos and explosions. There are plot holes galore and plot points that are painfully overlooked, such as just how in the world Mathyus's sidekick escaped from being buried neck-deep in sand. It just happened, and it was left that way, never mentioned again. In short, this is pretty damn close to ""Violence: the Movie."" This is all not mentioning the terrible acting, especially the Rock, who seems to visually struggle with making some facial expressions other than the typical angry wrestler one. I almost cried out in agony when he gave the people's eyebrow. There's no character in Mathyus... he's just the Rock dressed up in period garb and without most of his trademark lines. Poor Bernard Hill and Kelly Hu. Being relegated to the background, they have important roles but not much to do. This is gotta be pretty sad for them because Hill actually CAN act very well (see Lord of the Rings and Titanic) but he gets less than twenty minutes of screen time in this thing. I can tell he had fun with his character and he steals every scene he's in. And Kelly Hu, one of the most under-appreciated actresses in Hollywood, fares no better. Instead of developing a serious female lead with strength and brains, she's forced into the confined role of a female lead you'd expect to find in an 80s scifi or fantasy movie. Indeed, there's practically nothing for her to do except endure the scenes where the director and producers mercilessly strip away unnecessary garments to reveal as much flesh as possible (as much as possible) and make her pose like a comic-book slut next to the Rock's bare torso.Bad special effects, B-Movie action scenes and plenty of explosions; the Scorpion King is a mindless, story-less, message's, and altogether lacking experience that one should only watch on a Monday night when you've just been fired from a job and is only two hours away from being evicted. Even then, if you're an intellectual and actual WANT to watch a good movie, skip this one. It's frustratingly pointless, with large parts given to bad actors and bit parts given to good ones. Granted, the Rock's acting has improved, but I bet he'll be glad to forget this awful excuse of a movie.",The Scorpion King
237,jbonner71,TSK: A Mildly Amusing Romp...But No People's Eyebrow,5,6 February 2014,"The way I see it, there are two ways to look at The Scorpion King: as a guy's guy, in which case TSK is the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, or as a critically thinking, intellectual male, in which case TSK is a somewhat amusing, 90-minute exercise in historical inaccuracy. Either way, I think the world would be an infinitely better place with Kelly Hu running about in skimpy outfits whilst pretending to be important. Butthat could just be the (highly uninformed) opinion of my penis. Mr. Penis tends to cloud my judgment sometimes and here, he almost succeeded in convincing me that The Scorpion King is a good movie. But, all he really convinced me of was that I like Kelly Hu. A lot.There really isn't much story in The Scorpion King — a spin-off of The Mummy movies — but what little story there is focuses on Mathayus (The Rock, in his first starring role), the last of the Akkadians, and his quest to capture the precognitive sorceress (the aforementioned Hu) of the despotic king, Memnon (Steven Brand). There is also some nonsense about a band of ""free"" rebels, led by Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan) but, at the end of the day, all this flick needs is The Rock kicking much ass. And he does that. Quite well, actually.The Scorpion King was originally in theaters in 2002, but was just released on Blu-ray this recently. Both visually and aurally, this disc shines. It both looks and sounds great in the high-def format. It's in the extras department where this disc is lacking. There are interactive, documentary featurettes that you can access at various points in the film, but I always find these distracting and they don't really offer any great insights into the filmmaking process. I mean, who really wants to hear The Rock waxing rhapsodically about the desert locations where the film was shot? I know I don't. All I want to see is the goddamn People's Eyebrow, which is noticeably absent from this entire production.There is also a commentary track from director Chuck Russell, which is informative on a certain level but you won't be missing much if you decide to it skip entirely. And that's it for special features on this disc.All in all, if you're a fan of The Rock, the WWE, and big, dumb action movies then, by all means, this is the disc for you. Crank it up and let the Godsmack tunage blow you through the back wall of your goddamn living room. Otherwise, save your money and wait for the Blu-ray release of the infinitely more satisfying (on many, many levels) Dark City.",The Scorpion King

Far from being this generations ""Conan The Barbarian"", ""Scorpion King"" is more likely to be this generations ""Krull"".

Against my better judgment, I decided to watch this atrocity with them. To be blunt, the creators of this film did just about everything wrong, from horrendous acting, to an inconsistent musical score, to outright ripping off scenes from Indiana Jones and Conan the Barbarian. The films also lacks any form of uniqueness and originality, and suspension of disbelief is non-existent. Not that I expected much from this film, I figured it would be one of those types of entertaining films that are watched just for fun and don't require any intellectual investment on the part of the viewer, the kind you'd watch after coming home from a long, hard day at work. Unfortunately, this film fails even in this category. It falls into the ""Is this ever going to end?"" category. The only reason I watched the whole thing was to not be rude to the people I was watching it with. I feel like I should be solving physics problems now to make up the IQ points that this film robbed from me.

Apparently the first cut, pre-reshoots, was about 70 minutes long. The finished product runs at about an hour and a half, with little plot. The lean pace ensures constant, surprisingly brutal (if bloodless) action and enough chuckles to see you through a large popcorn. The Rock is far better than you'd think, Michael Clarke Duncan is slumming it but clearly having fun, the effects are rather dodgy but who cares?

The actors delivered their lines in such a way, that I could not stop laughing, it was just ""to funny"" sometimes. Arnold Schwarzenegger could have played the part of the Scorpion King if he had been 15-20 years younger. Scorpion King reminds of Arnold's first movie ""Hercules in New York"" they are both of the same poor quality and its my opinion , that they both only should be viewed and released on VHS/DVD.",The Scorpion King
243,VioletNurikoYume,Not a bad movie if someone else is paying...,1,21 April 2002,"It has laughs.  It has action.  It has an attractive, sexy girl.  It has an attractive, musclebound guy.  And that, unfortunately, is about it.
It's fairly obvious that the reason this movie has such an influx of action is because, quite simply, The Rock--for all his muscle and good looks--is not terribly gifted at acting.  And while the action sequences -are- interesting to watch, I came out of this movie not really caring who lived or who died, simply because there is so -much- action that there is no characterization at all.  I can sympathize with certain aspects of the characters--the loss of family members, the loss of homeland, etc. However, I care nothing at all for the characters themselves, because there just isn't enough about them.  There isn't nearly enough dialogue; the romance between Mathayus and Cassandra feels almost painfully-forced.Aside from that, the plot is predictable and overdone, the women are nearly all helpless idiots who race around shrieking and being generally useless, and a great many of the Action Hero Battle Comments are truly uninspired--some might say, ""cheesy.""The Scorpion King, however, isn't necessarily a bad movie.  If someone else is paying, I'd recommend going to see it.  Once.  Maybe.  But you might want to bring your gameboy along, just in case.",The Scorpion King
244,hockeyguy9,Just A Fun and Simple Action/Adventure Movie,7,22 May 2002,"This movie isn't going to revolutionize the film industry...nor does it try to.  It's simply a fun and simple movie, easy to get into but nothing that's going to make you think too much (or at all?), with good action scenes and a decent story.  It tries to do these things and succeeds.  It won't be remembered too much in years to come as anything other than The Rock's first major starring role, but that's ok.This probably could have been a standout, but unfortunately there are a couple of things that keep it in the mediocre range.  For one, the story and characters are just a little too bland or cliched.  I've heard it compared to ""Conan The Barbarian"", and while I don't necessarily think it's the most accurate comparison, I do think that this movie doesn't do anything story-wise that hasn't been done before.  The fight scenes are the same way. In the post-Matrix and Jackie Chan world, for a fight scene to really stick out it has to be awe-inspiring, with creativity and acrobatic theatrics. This has neither, but instead just good ol' fashioned butt-kicking.  It makes the fight scenes a little forgettable, though.I can't fault The Rock for his performance.  Sure, he doesn't blow you away with his acting ability, but with the script he was given, he wasn't asked to, either.  He has potential far beyond what's displayed in this film, although his ability to draw people into the theaters should now be easily seen.  With just an unknown in the starring role, this is a $40 million movie tops...even with the Mummy franchise label on it.  If it hadn't faced tough competition from Spider-Man and Episode 2 late in its run, this probably would easily exceed 100 million in the box office.  It may get there anyway.  But back to the movie itself...Basically it's just an average, fun action movie.  It's entertaining enough to keep your attention and serves its main purpose, which we all pretty much realize is to introduce Hollywood's Next Big Thing (The Rock).  He's set to become the type of action star we haven't seen since Sly and Arnold faded away in the genre towards the mid-late 90's.  This is a noteworthy movie for that, and good enough to see at least once.  Don't expect to be blown away, but it's worthwhile to rent or catch on cable.  7/10",The Scorpion King

I really do recommend this to anyone, I'm definitely going to get The Scorpion King 2 at some point! I just wish there were more than two films in the series!Dwayne Johnson naturally plays Mathayus very well, he's just the right guy for one of the greatest assassins on the planet.Both Steven Brand and Michael Clarke Duncan plays their roles as Memnon and Balthazar, respectively very well.

The first time I saw it, and the first time I saw The Rock, I only watched the final fight. When he had thrown The Bad Guy in the ocean of flames (where, 3 minutes later, people are standing??), saved the girl (who was a prisoner whom he saved) and rescued the people, he is standing in front of the full moon and the girl comes running to his side. As he breathes in to lift his sword I started roaring. My brother, who was watching, gave me a queer glance. I said 'Oh come on! It's just like in the lion king when Simba is to become king and walks up the cliff and roar!'. That is my conclusion on this movie. But don't misunderstand me, I love it.

When I sat down to watch 'The Scorpion King' I didn't know that much about it, I knew The Rock was starring in it but assumed this was just a career change for him and I was willing to give him a chance. However, I was very wrong. It just seemed like wrestling to me. A movie full of beautiful women wearing as little as possible and hairy, beefy guys fighting each other in a very 'choreographed' way. A boring script, boring plot, very very exaggerated acting...I'm sorry I had to sit through it. An hour and a half of my life wasted. In fact I'm wasting more and more of my life by writing a review.

Despite the killing, it is great for younger audiences who might more appreciate the rebellious tenacity of the Rock in this movie; who (believes) knows nothing can stop him.A good movie and recommended.

The Rock establishes himself as a believeable action lead and shows he has career in movies if he decides to hang up the wrestling boots. He was about as good as you could ask for in this movie.

There's no story or all that jazz and this movie isn't ashamed to get straight to the point without any delay and that is of course, the bashing and the thrashing. Even if you hate pro wrestling and its fake characters, you have to give some credit to the Rock for being a good actor and a good action star and that is undeniable. The action sequences are pretty good as are the fights, much better than any of the Mummy movies and this is on a different level. The plot is that basically there's a bad guy and the Rock has to defeat him and thats it.

257,Paul-E,This film is good fun,7,19 April 2002,"The tone of this film is set right from the pre-credits scene with a nice action scene showing The Rock beating the snot out of many big blokes. After that you get a nice brisk 90 minute actioner that doesn't give you a chance to be bored and keeps you amused with the laughs as well as the fight scenes. The Rock looks fantastic, he's got 'Movie Star' written all over him, and boy is he athletic. He leaps, he runs, he hacks people to bits with his sword and best of all he has really good comic timing. The fact that The Rock is a professional wrestler does help the action (apparently he did all his own stunts) and gives the punch up scene between him and the other rock in this film, Michael Clarke Duncan, a real hard edge. Speaking of Duncan, he looks like he's having a ball. He doesn't have a particularly big part in the film, but lends some weight to the cast, plus he gets to throw people about which must've been the selling point for him. Kelly Hu as the sorceress isn't too bad either, she looks gorgeous in an array of very revealing costumes. Yes the script is on the cheesy side (but I think it's meant to be) and the villain isn't really that good (but this is The Rock's film after all) and the film is painfully short (barely 90 minutes) but all in all very enjoyable and very entertaining. Probably the most fun I've had at the cinema since Blade back in 1998. Go see it and have a laugh and don't worry that it's a film with a pro-wrestler in the lead role, The Rock is a hell of a lot better than Hulk Hogan in the acting department.",The Scorpion King

Since the movie is a vehicle for wrestling superstar The Rock and promotions for it were squeezing 'the Mummy' into every sentence (they forgot to mention it did not have a Mummy-like budget) I thought this would be a disaster. However it's got a lot going for it. Good action, reasonable CGI, Steven Brand is impressive as the evil king Memnon and The Rock at least does better than Schwarzenegger did in Conan ! flaws ?

259,MichaelMcCullar,A Solid Popcorn Flick,8,19 April 2002,"The Scorpion King is a solid, entertaining popcorn flick.  It never pretends to be anything but that.  At 88 minutes, it moves fast enough to keep you from thinking about anything but the action onscreen.  Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson shows why he is the single most popular sports entertainment performer around.  His personality bleeds off the celluloid, and the script wisely gives him only 10 or so lines so that we never have to question whether or not he can act.  The Rock has two things going for him that other wrestlers-cum-actors, most notably Hulk Hogan and ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, lack: athleticism and charisma.  People have been making a lot of comparisons between Rock and Arnold, and I think they are valid.  This is nowhere near the caliber of Conan the Barbarian, but it isn't Conan the Destroyer either. If The Rock picks and chooses his scripts carefully to showcase his talents and mask his shortcomings, and gradually improves in those areas, then we could really be looking at the next big action hero.",The Scorpion King

I would definitely qualify this with an ""...if you like action flicks."" Michael Clarke Duncan is a nice addition to the cast, as I know him from movies like The Green Mile and The Whole Nine Yards (two great movies, both with excellent performances on his part).  Kelly Hu did well on her role as well, and is a very fine looking woman to boot.  I am unfamiliar with Steven Brand but he performed pretty well as the villain.The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) was everything I expected: Big, menacing, cocky, and funny.  He definitely kicked some butt.  The one-liners were very modern and some of the scenarios in the movie were pretty far fetched (like the ""Chinese recipe"") but added to the action factor.  As I said, WISIWUG.In conclusion, I would say that it could have been a better movie for me personally if they had tied in the storyline from ""The Mummy Returns"".  But then again if you had not seen that movie I would guess that it probably wouldn't hurt not knowing the Scorpion King's fate.I would recommend that you go see this movie if you like action.  Don't expect a great plotline - it has an average one, at best.  Good stunts and a fairly neat concept, but it could have been better in my opinion.  I gave it a ""6"" out of ten, although a 6.5 was my actual comment on the way out of the movie theater - but isn't an option at the IMDB so I rounded down out of fairness to all the ""7"" movies out there.",The Scorpion King

Minimal character development, several plot loopholes, and mid-level CGI made this movie about as average as possible.  Sure it has The Rock, but a total absence of Rock-related wrestling moves makes the audience look at him as an actor, and his performance is average at best. The plot was contrived could not flesh out in the short running time. Overall, this movie was lame.

262,conorg,For those who miss the conan days...,7,19 April 2002,"There was a time when this type of movie would have been just one of many fantasy action epics, among the likes of the Conan movies, Red Sonja, Beastmaster et al, and I for one found it refreshing to see a big screen outing for this type of flick - though one is probably enough.The action is well put together, the fighting scenes enjoyably over the top and the acting kept to a bare minimum - which, frankly, is just what is needed here. No need for ""De Niroesque"" character acting here - that would detract from what the movie is trying to achieve with the audience - an entertaining yarn which does not take itself seriously at all and where leaving your brain firmly at the door is a prerequisite.Dwayne Johnson's lines are also kept to a bare minimum which was a little worrying at times, considering he doesn't have the obvious vocal or speech limitations of a Schwarzenegger, Stallone or Ferigno and who on a weekly basis makes speeches to thousands of avid wrestling fans. Its almost as if the director was afraid to trust him with anything more to say. Although, in fairness to the director, Mr Johnson did seem more at ease with 2-3 word sentences (e.g. ""Die Well..."") than with anything more - and with the longer pieces of dialogue he seemed to revert into his wrestling persona. When he was doing what he does best however I thought he excelled. He did cut an impressive lone action hero figure and handled the fighting scenes with aplomb. In these days when muscles are not as popular and action heroes are expected to be more human and thoughtful this is a refreshing turn from the Rock.Scantily clad women (the sorceress in particular) are also aplenty here, almost as much as the fighting - which was appreciated, though in general what I thought this movie lacked was that dark edge which the earlier mentioned movies possessed - and at times there was a disappointingly Xenaish look to some of the scenes.Yes, you can complain that the script here is predictable, and as cliched as they come and that the story could have been a helluva lot more imaginative but hey, you're not going to see a good will hunting type movie here, you're here to see the Rock kick some warrior ass - lighten up.Obviously this movie did not have anywhere near the budget as the last Mummy movie but it does succeed largely in what it sets out to do and I got just what I wanted out of it - plenty of action, fighting and beautiful ladies.",The Scorpion King

I laughed the whole time, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it.  I don't even know anything about the Rock, I don't like wrestling and I REALLY didn't like The Mummy. I'll definitely go see another movie with the Rock now, he's fun and not too pretentious.  If you like the Conan movies or the Hercules or Xena shows at all, then you'll probably like this, because it's pretty much a combination of them all.I admire a film that can be cheesy AND good.

They have a comedic sidekick played by Grant Heslov, and I do admit that he was funny.  The Rock has a tight sword-fight with Michael Clarke Duncan which entertained me very much.

The Rock has a great sense of humor and it shows. He rides a camel - which makes lots of sense in the desert - and makes it look easy.This film has everything needed for a satisfying sword-and-sorcery movie: funny sidekick, wisecracking relation whose demise provides motivation, cute little kids, sexy heroine with revealing wardrobe, evil tyrant, crackpot inventor, brave rebels, smart and loyal animal that also provides a few laughs, sandstorms, snakes, scorpions, The Rock's rippling muscles, The Rock's glistening chest, The Rock's cool long hairdo, The Rock fighting with sword, bow and arrow, knives, and fists, and of course the Rock's still-glistening and well-muscled chest! I really don't care whether any of the dialogue makes sense as long as I can look at The Rock with his shirt off!I give the movie a 7, but The Rock's physique is a ten!

The fight scenes are quite good,there is some humor,tons of action and good acting.The Rock actually impressed me with his acting ability.he showed a lot of potential in this film and didn't stink up the theater,as i thought he would.This movie doesn't have a lot to do with the previous entries.the story is quite a bit different.there is a lot more mysticism and romance and none of the main characters from the first two have returned for this movie.this is really The Rock's movie,and he has to carry it.he does a pretty good job for his first big starring feature.though not as good as the two ""Mummy"" films,tit still rates high in my book.for me,""The Scorpion King""is a solid 9/10",The Scorpion King
270,nomad20,Good Action Movie,7,9 March 2005,"I am the sort of person who enjoys films that make me think about things like directing, cinematography, and that make me ask myself, ""What is the significance of the actions that scene?"" But I like a good movie where I am just along for the ride just as much as anyone else. ""The Scorpion King"" is one such movie. The Rock really breaks out in this film as a good action here, and his trademark eyebrow lift comes helps to provide for some comic relief and a certain sense of familiarity with the actor.Overall, it's not a great film, but it is a good movie, especially when you just want some entertainment that is fun and family safe.",The Scorpion King
271,Korridin,Mindless Entertainment,6,2 April 2006,"Anyone expecting a serious movie, or a masterpiece should turn this off before the end of the opening credits. This movie surely does not take itself seriously, so anyone else taking it seriously will inevitably be disappointed. Don't expect it to teach you any history either, since all the writers did was take a bunch of names mentioned in ancient history and shove them all together. However this said, the movie is good for a laugh and it has some excellent action, albeit with almost no blood in sight (I'm not entirely sure if the movie shows people bleeding when they get stuck with arrows). The comedy is clearly intended to come from the pathetic sidekick character that Mathayus picks up during a close encounter with some fire ants. But surprisingly it is Mathayus himself who comes out with some of the best jokes, mainly related to who he will or won't kill and how much it will cost. As well as amusement from the antics of the characters, there is also enjoyment to be had from checking out the lavish costumes and sets for the film. Some excellent thought and research has gone into the appearance, both of the city of Gommorah and of its various denizens from the evil emperor Memnon right down to the random guards that are only really there as something for Mathayus to beat up when he has nothing better to do. Cultures that are historically centuries apart, from Classical Greeks to Ancient Egyptians, have been successfully melded to give the movie an ancient multicultural look. So yes, the acting isn't Oscar quality, and the plot won't stand up to a microscopic examination, but this is not the worst movie of all time by a long shot, and it's actually quite enjoyable once you disengage your analytical mind and just accept this movie for what it is: a harmless piece of fun.",The Scorpion King

Let's give it a try !"".What a mistake. No script, no acting, no nothing. When there is some humor, it's very difficult to say if its wanted or not. The bad guy is ridiculous, the good guy too.

This movie was not written specifically for the Rock, those making such statements really need to do thier homework. I agree however that if you not a rock fan, this movie probably isnt your forte'. An excellent action movie none the less, special affects,sound affects, and fight scenes where spectacular. And who cares about seeing Kelly Hu half naked through out the movie, for all you chick ""rock"" fans out there, you get to see the Rock half naked through out the movie, that is worth it alone.

280,LadyGray,Your basic kick ass movie.,9,19 April 2002,"As far as this movie goes I really don't see what people are complaining about.  This was your basic ""bad guy kills good guys' brother, good guy seeks revenge"" type of a movie.  The plot is simple, the characters are basically very easy to understand and the movie is spelled out for you.  I would have liked to see a more developed script, however this one in my opinion is acceptable.  I didn't go to this movie to experience some huge life changing revelation or for it to be some though provoking drama.  I went to the movie to see the good guy triumph over evil with multiple sword fights and banter between characters along the way.  Every actor pulled off their characters as well as they could.  The only thing is the movie that made me sigh was the amount of time the sorceress stayed in her little ""rag tag/barely covers her skin"" outfit after Mathayus kidnapped her from Memnon's palace.  I'm sitting there going ""They're now in an encampment full of people and no one has anything she can borrow.... right...""  Beyond that I had no complaints.  They just played out the ""sexy chic"" thing for too long.If you liked The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns you should like this movie. It's the same writing style that has the action/adventure/romance all rolled into one.  If you don't go into the movie expecting to be blown away by some heavy drama then you should like it.  Go and see it just for the sheer entertainment factor, not the brain power (or lack there of) that it takes to follow the story.",The Scorpion King
281,lycanthrop,"Strong action, weak dialogue",7,15 May 2002,"After finally getting to watch Scorpion King, I was not too disappointed with the movie. Nice flashy martial sequences. A swash buckling hero weaving a heavy weapon like a wand in one instant and double left footed in the next instant. Well you can't blame them if they were employing wrestling moves with oversized implements in their hands.Had to admit that although there was not many(actually closer to none) huge blue screen instances where you can watch impressive hordes sweep over the landscape like in the Mummy Returns, this movie was a rather nicely timed tight package. I barely noticed the 90 or more minutes flowing past.The Rock did indeed cut a fine figure but was kind of disappointed that he was not given more impressive dialogue. From the interview on David Letterman's The Rock was a rather well-spoken, intelligent and humorous individual. So I had different expectations. More rage and testosterone filled ranting from his arcadian character would have been better but instead there were nothing more than muted words of wisdom? Ah the eye candy, Kelly Hu who you say? I have to admit that I was most attentive from the point The Rock intruded during her bath. Was it was wishful thinking to actually to have more glimpses of her flesh (For shame !). Again her character like all of the others were sadly underplayed. Poor Michael Clarke Duncan and the unfunny horse thief.Overall this was an entertaining movie to watch and then not analyze too much about. Flaws were aplenty but was a great vehicle for the people's champion. Would I recommend this movie to others? Well if they are out for a nice evening no brainer movie filled with action...yes. If they are the finicky ones that prefer the airy fairy and hate everything involved with wrestling and its colourful characters...nah.",The Scorpion King
282,CXtreme2K,What an awesome movie.,10,4 May 2002,"Before I get to the movie, I'd like to say that I'm not surprised about this movie being bashed by all of you wanna-be critics. Most of you believe in that stereotype that all wrestlers can't act, when that's what they do in the ring. Act. You all know you couldn't do any better if your lives depended on it. I bet more then half of you haven't even seen the damn movie yet, but rather heard it from your friends, or another source, and if you did, you hated this movie for stupid reasons. ""Oh, hey, it had nothing to do with The Mummy."" It was never supposed to have anything to do with it. It is called a spin-off, not a prequel, to the Mummy series. Or maybe you think this movie sucks because its dialogue is too modern. Maybe so, but I'd rather not be stuck with a past dialogue like in the modern version of Romeo and Juliet, when I can't understand the damn thing.Now, to focus on the movie. I loved it. I loved the music, including the theme, ""I stand alone"". I was very entertained by the action sequences, and watching the Rock/the Scorpion King, whoop ass as he does in the ring. (Now those of you reading this would probably say, ""But wrestling is fake. It's all scripted."" First off, wrestling is not fake. It is not real, for damn sure. It is FIXED. Second, movies are scripted just as wrestling is.) I also loved the sorceress, Kelly Hu. I don't think she had a name in the movie... But she didn't really need one, since she was most of the time being used as a Sorceress anyway. Now, it was also predictable, I'll admit. But what ISN'T predictable these days? Not a lot of movies are not predictable. Besides, it's two big black guys (The Rock and MDC) fighting two scrawny white guys (Memnon, and the other dude...). Who would win anyway?I'll finish this off by saying I loved the movie, and I'd like to see the Rock continue to have a main role in more movies. I would definitely see a sequel if it would come out. This movie owns. I give it a 10.",The Scorpion King

However his acting on screen leaves a lot to be desired. There was no depth, no conviction to the character he was trying to portray. I felt like it was just a drag. Even as an action movie it was poor, and that is hard to do! Perhaps it is because we are so used to the Rock in one way, but perhaps not. The bottom line is the Rock needs to stay away from Hollywood and the film industry and stick with what he is best at.",The Scorpion King
284,akshay_a,"Hollywood ""Bollywood-style""",5,20 April 2002,"Franchise movies usually run out of steam by the third movie, and The Scorpion King is no exception. My advice is that if you're looking for a ""time-pass"" movie that doesn't require brainpower, then watch The Scorpion King. If you're looking for a follow-up to the excellent The Mummy, and The Mummy Returns, then this is NOT the movie to watch.After I saw The Scorpion King, the only way I could summarize it was ""Hindi Movie"" (for those not familiar with Indian cinema, my comment meant that the movie was silly, and pointless, but a heck of a lot of fun; for those familiar with Indian cinema, let's just say the writers of the movie have probably watched too many Rajnikant movies). The plot is quite thin, and almost predictable. Plenty of scantily clad women running around though, and some comic relief in through a sidekick (cliched), and a eccentric scientist almost make this an Egyptian ""James Bond"".I suppose knowing that the WWF had a large hand in the making of this movie (The Rock's ... acting talents as main lead, and Vince McMahon's entertainment philosophy as Executive Producer) made the slightly painful experience a little easier to accept.",The Scorpion King

The film never takes itself too seriously and is never lacking in fight scenes. I'm not sure why the critics have decided to hammer this so badly, maybe they just feel they can't say nice things about spin-offs. I thought that some of the personal remarks made about the stars were uncalled for (eg The Rock - ""With his bulging eyes, skinny plucked-looking eyebrows, heavy-metal mane and monotone voice"" said one).

It was really corny in places, and the link to naming the Arcadian as Scorpion King seemed to be a little bit tenuous.I would also like to comment on the critics. I have read some reviews of the film and I do think that they are being a bit unfair. The Rock is a wrestler, not an actor (although the two can sometimes be viewed as synonymous) and he won't get any Academy nominations for his performance.

I think they could have played the scorpioon thing up a little better or differently to make a better association.  They called him the Scorpion King only at the end.  Why?  Because of the poisoned arrow?  Please! I gave this a '3' rating since it did not hold up to my expectations - I didn't think I was purchasing a Swashbuckler.

He has to face an evil ruler and conquerer who uses a gifted fortuneteller to win his battles.The Rock shows that he can be a good action hero like Arnold and Sly was in the 80's and 90's. He has a good sense of humor and at the same time he is a though killing machine.The story is great so there is no chance you will get bored by this film unless you hate action movies. The scenery and atmosphere in the movie is really nice. It makes me wish I could go back in time and experience those ancient and mythical places in the Middle East.The only thing that is bad about this movie is some of the fighting scenes. They are a bit unrealistic. But still they are not very supernatural like the scenes in the Chinese movies like ""Hero."" I would also have liked to see more erotic scenes like you see in ""Conan the Barbarian."" I really don't have much bad to say about this movie. I leave that to the more critical people.

Comparisons to Conan are obvious (in some cases, there's almost a scene-by-scene similarity), but there are some notable differences. Scorpion King shows no blood despite hundreds getting killed, and the sex is all implied (though the female lead wears little more than a strip of fabric. Woof.) Believe it or not Conan was also a deeper movie (Hah! How often did you think you'd hear that?) -- it at least had the pretense of exploring the philosophy of steel and contrasted the bad guy with the hero in interesting ways. In Scorpion King we have much more of a stock villain.

This film takes time out to laugh at its self, which you have to respect an action film that knows it is not an Oscar winner.

The actors come with what should be funny remarks throughout the whole movie. However this does not contribute anything good whatsoever.

Seeing The Mummy or The Mummy Returns first isn't needed, since there is almost no tie in whatsoever. If you have a chance to see this movie, I say go for it!",The Scorpion King
308,stercorum,Entertaining,7,20 April 2002,"I saw this movie last night and was pleasantly entertained. I have read heavy criticism and found it to be unwarranted. The Rock played himself in much the same way as Arnie did in Conan the Barbarian, but with much more conviction and presence.What do the critics expect? The film was obviously designed to entertain and not to provoke serious historical discussion. It succeeded suprisingly well in the former.",The Scorpion King
309,Peter Michael Wilson,Why bother?,1,13 May 2002,"The ""Scorpion King"" is just another bad sequel made for the sole purpose of bringing in cash. The ""Rock"" should stick to acting badly on Monday Night Raw. I cannot believe the number of people who would pay $12 to see this crap, c'mon the guy is a wrestler, how can you take this film seriously? It's not a comedy, therefore there shouldn't be jokes acting in it.If I had to some up the ""Mummy"" series in one word it would be ""Unrespectable"". Oh, and they should have Brendan Fraser in one of the next sequels, watching him struggle through a scene makes me cry laughing. Anyone who fell for this disaster/waste of film much have entered the wrong cinema.Good Day.(Do yourself a favour and watch an independent or foreign film!)",The Scorpion King
310,gtddstorie,Excellent Action - Need voice lessons though,6,4 May 2002,"The Rock was excellent in the actions shots.  He was a natural and I would put him up against the best such as Arnold, Bruce, Sylvester, etc.The acting itself of course will improve with time.  He needs to do something about changing the tone of his voice.  It was on a monotone scale throughout the movie.  Here was a ""Hoss"" of a man, with a very calming, quiet voice.  Not the sound you expect from ""The Scorpion King.""Next time - show a little skin below the waist, just enough to tease the moviegoers.",The Scorpion King
311,Daniel Cross,"Silly, predictable, cliched nonsense. Great fun.",4,16 April 2002,"This film could be worse.  Not much, but it could star Steven Seagal and take itself seriously.  It doesn't, and kids will love it.  I'd rather watch honest hokum than pompous rubbish such as Vanilla Sky.
Just a few questions though.  Its set in Gomorrah, in the Middle East, yet the Rock's brother is Hawaiian?  The bad guy is English (as usual) and the Amazon warriors looks like cheerleaders from Baltimore.  Mind you, the film never claims to be authentic.Is The Rock the new Arnie?  He's just as expressive and can act better than Tom Cruise.  Hmmm, the future looks bright....",The Scorpion King
312,Draefer,"Worth a look, just for a lark...",6,18 April 2002,"I read an article in the entertainment section of a recent newspaper, under the heading `Movie Beefcakes are Back, and Looking Silly'. And now, after giving in to curiosity and seeing The Scorpion King, I would have to agree.but `silly' doesn't necessarily equate to `bad'. This bewildering prequel to the sequel of the remake (anyone confused yet?) sees the hulking Dwayne Johnson, aka. The Rock, joining such action heroes as Sly Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger. He stars as an assassin named Mathayus, who gets more than he bargained for when he and his mates are hired to bump off the evil King's sorceress advisor.Simple enough, hardly differs at all from any other warrior-barbarian horde-sword fighting flick. I say bewildering though, because it doesn't seem to make much sense as far as the Mummy films are concerned. The Mummy Returns saw the bloodthirsty Scorpion King storming cities with his army of Anubis warriors and murdering people left right and centre. Here we have a tough-guy assassin who teams up with a tribe of people against a tyrannical king, and basically becomes a wisecracking softy. This film could have been called something else.'Mathayus the Liberator'.or the `Bonehead Akadian'. It wouldn't have made much difference, and it could have worked as a stand-alone story. Perhaps we'll see Mathayus turn to the dark side in `Scorpion King: Episode II - Attack of the Weird Dog-headed Guys'. While it's not a great lead role debut for the wrestler/actor, it's not terrible either. The film makes us remember that being able to swing a big sword about and slash lots of villains can sometimes make up for the inability to remember more than one line of script at a time. And while it doesn't seem entirely appropriate in the setting, the humour is plentiful and chuckle-worthy, even if most of it does come through the cliché comedy sidekick.Also, a special round of applause must go to the special effects department, not for the quality of their work, but for the unusual restraint they were able to show. After seeing the Mummy Returns and being bombarded with a nauseating overdose of CGI, it was refreshing to see the Scorpion King work with only a few necessary, well-placed effects. Overall, a 6 out of 10. More than a little cheesy, and not very original.mostly a `been there done that' affair, but with a modern feel to it, and good, healthy action. I considered giving an extra point out of ten for Kelly Hu's revealing clothing, but that wouldn't have been very professional.",The Scorpion King
313,wheatleyd,the best nights entertainment I`ve had in years.,10,18 April 2002,"The Scorpion King is the best adventure movie I have seen to date, I  never thought that the rock would reappear as the scorpion king in his own movie. the special effects are exellent, as an avid movie collector I will be adding this one to my collection, and I recomend that if you are a fan of the rock, then go and see this movie, (YOU WILL ENJOY IT) as I did, it was the best two hours I have spent at the movies in a long time.",The Scorpion King
314,jberry4,Wrestling on Steroids,8,19 April 2002,"This movie is a vehicle for promoting The Rock, nothing more nothing less. It will be compared to Arnold's Conan fling, from now until forever.  And my opinion is that the Scorpion King is 10 times better.  In this Role Dewayne Johnson, is more fluid both with his movements and line delivery.  He is not a finished project by any means, but you can not keep his natural personality from just oozing through.The movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end, with no more than 15 minutes between any big fight scenes.  It has more of a feel of a high dollar martial arts movie or something ala John Woo.  Don't look for the political intrigue of Gladiator or the love story of Braveheart, but expect the action of both combined.  If you like beautiful woman, go see the movie. If you like Rock go see the movie.  If you like action fight scenes or quick one line humor (like Judge Dred or Indiana Jones) go see the movie. Or if you just want to be entertained, GO See The Movie.",The Scorpion King
315,jabantick,What a Waste of $$$,1,19 April 2002,"*** WARNING, SPOILERS AHEAD ***This is definitely one of the worst movies of the year/Flame OnI have two question about this movie.  Correct me if I'm wrong, I think the movie took place before the pyramids are built, hmm... so that's like what? somewhere around 2600 BC?  So how the hell did ""Chinese Gun-Powder Formula"" appear during that time? The Chinese did not invent the gun-powder until 700 - 800 AD, LOL... what the hell were they thinking?The second question is, when Grant Heslov (the guy who plays the horse thief, or you might remember him from True Lies) tries to touch the rock's bow, The Rock immediately grabs his hand and tells him never touch his bow, and in the scene where the rock falls into a room full of women and they all manage to steal some weapons off from him (even his beloved bow) while seducing him! I was like WTF, what kind of stupid ""hero"" is that!Oh well, /Flame Off, yeah yeah, I know what you are thinking, at least Kelly Hu isn't that bad to look at, in that kind of outfit of course.Don't waste your money to see this movie, if you really want to see The Rock, just watch him on Monday Night Raw.",The Scorpion King
316,ored4jc,Caution,3,20 April 2002,"Hi, I went to see this movie on night it premiered at the theatre. I cannot emphasize this enough. If you want to see an interesting movie, with a decent plot, convincing characters, and some good quality action scenes,..... Stay clear. You'd stand a better chance watching space balls. I wouldn't say the Scorpion King has a shallow plot. It has no plot! The rock is supposed to be some skilled assassin who vows to end the reign of a King called Memnon. Memnon was made king, as he was mightiest warrior in the land. His quest for domination of the entire land catches the attention of Mathayus (the scorpion king), who is paid to kill Memnon's sorceress. The sorceress is the reason for Memnon's victory. He doesn't though. Mainly because she's always scantily dressed. This is as deep as the plot goes. Again, let me warn you that it will be much better if you rented space balls from blockbuster.",The Scorpion King
317,reptilevanry,Better than critics say!,8,20 April 2002,"The Scorpion King was slammed by critics, but in my opinion it was an excellent movie. Dwane ""The Rock"" Johnson did a great job considering it was his first big movie (where he actually had more than a couple of lines). Yes the story line had a few holes in it, but all in all I found The Scorpion King to be a very enjoyable movie.",The Scorpion King
318,bigmarts,"I thought this was a spoof, it's that bad.",1,24 April 2002,"After about the first ten minutes I almost walked out.  After that I decided that the film must be a spoof, and as such was actually pretty funny.  In fact me and my friends were laughing hysterically most of the way through the film.The acting is criminally bad, to the point of disbelief that they were intending this to be serious.The script was just ridiculous, every line a cliché from the scriptwriters handbook.  Such classics as 'I bring my fathers head as sign of my allegiance' followed by producing a head from behind him and lobbing it on the floor.  Or the other 'anyone touching the women has to come through me first'. Oh bravo, how original, how brave. Jesus!!The plot, apart from being pretty lame, was full of holes.  I mean, why was it called the scorpion king???  He gets stabbed by an arrow with scorpion poison.  Then at the end, the black guy calls him 'Scorpion King' despite, never knowing that he was stabbed with the darn arrow.  Oh, yea, that reminds me of another classic line, 'he will live, but the blood of the scorpion will forever run through his veins'.  That had us laughing for a good few minutes.If you go to see this as a serious film, then it is possibly one of the worst wastes, of time, money, effort ever contrived.If you watch it as a clever spoof it's actually very funny.  Probably a good one to watch with a few friends and lots of alcohol.  The plot's so thin you won't miss anything (apart from the hilarious script) if you go off to the loo, or start chatting.I just wish people wouldn't go watch these w**k films, maybe Hollywood (laughs) would stop making such pap.",The Scorpion King
319,trevors_the_manaquin,A KICK ASS MOVIE,10,28 April 2002,"I thought this movie was amazing The Rock is the man. The Rock did a good job acting in this movie the reason why he did so well was because hes such a good wrestler. Through the whole movie i was wondering when is he gonna show the peoples eyebrow and he never did. The chick in the film was good i loved the part ""I've come for the woman and your head,"" it was a good part. There was a few good parts with some comedy in them. Overall i gave this movie a 10/10 it was amazing.",The Scorpion King
320,t_i_y,excellent movie for anyone over 18 yrs of age,8,30 April 2002,"I saw this with my wife and we both loved it.  The scenes where they show some skin don't really add to the story and easily could have been left out. I don't think this is a movie for anyone under the age of 18.The one thing that did bother me about this movie is that it is rated PG-13 and a boy under the age of 13, an actor in the film, has a full-naked women show up in front of him out of a ""well"" of water that he is wishing at. Thank Hollywood for that stunt!",The Scorpion King
321,gr8onerg,Lots of action but somewhat predictable,7,2 May 2002,"This is a very good movie, it had some lame dialogue here & there and some predictable scenes towards the end.  Changing the Rocks character in mid stream was odd, but he does a very good job with his role.  HE EVEN DID ""THE PEOPLES EYEBROW"" which was COOL.  Can't wait to see SK2! The Rock shows that a wrestler can make the crossover to the big screen. Roddy Piper & Hulk Hogan- Take NOTES",The Scorpion King
322,magna360,So Terrible!!!!!!!!,1,7 May 2002,"This movie was horrible.  It was the most agonizing 90 minutes of my life. The action sequences were extremely predictable, such as when he pulled the arrow out of his back and shot it. Ahhhh! Action at its worst.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, save yourself 8 bucks and, if you really feel the need to, pick it up at Blockbuster in 5 months.  Hopefully sooner! The more money this movie makes the angrier I'll get.  Tell the people my story!",The Scorpion King
323,red_devil82,A new star is born,10,9 May 2002,"This film´s got everything to become one of the greatest films ever! Romance, action, humor, drama, impressive special effects, fantastic fighting scenes and great actors who made a very good job! The Rock made a very good debut in his first leading part. He´s got the potential to become one of the greatest, not only in wrestling, but also in acting. Especially here in Germany, many people have huge prejudice if they hear things about e.g. the World Wrestling Federation (now Entertainment). You hear things like ""The superstars just have muscles, but no brain!"" So we had more than one bad critic about the film. The Rock was only good at the fighting scenes and so on. But that´s not the truth. The Rock made a fantastic job in every scene! I really love that film and will watch it at the cinema for a third time (and perhaps more often)! A real diamond in the world of film.",The Scorpion King
324,Cassandra The Sorceress Of Nite,It is a nice and touching film.,10,7 June 2002,"Among the films i find this film is full of love, hatred and sadness. This three feelings bring out the life in the movie. It shows that there were still people who are brave to try something that can make them lost their lifes. After the death of the two brothers, Mathayus is full of hatred that nearly drive him crazy and when he saw Cassandra he had fallen in love with her. There is too much to say and in anyway this is a lovely film.",The Scorpion King
325,Camiles,This movie is done in poor taste.,1,16 October 2002,"The violent and sensual content of this film might be interesting to the male observers but totally turns off the female viewer because the main female character is not only depicted as a half naked sexual object of the male character, but also has little character value. This film is totally dominated by male machoism and denigrates the value of life, humanity, and women. The hero of the movie is a hired killer who is glorified for the violent manner in which he relates to other characters.  I would not recommend taking children, teenagers, or adults to this movie.  It would not be worth the time or money.",The Scorpion King
326,highlorddns,just plain fun,8,13 January 2004,"It's not an award winner by any means, but I think The Rock plays a fun character.  And in this type of movie, I don't think any other actor could have made it as much fun as it was.  This is a movie you can't take seriously and just have to accept it's trying to have fun.  A fun tough guy movie with an actor the adds some good humor.  It's not the lines that are funny, but the way The Rock says them and the nonchalant manner in which they are said that makes them funny.  I don't know of any movie that purposely gives the hero a ""Bow of Knock Back 100 Feet"" try to claim it is anything other than a good fun time.",The Scorpion King

328,markdmytriyev-997-279086,As bad as stabbing yourself in the face,1,10 May 2014,Its a nightmare the worst casting ever everything is worst I cant believe a movie as crap as that has a sequel an anyone who likes it is wrong. Worst CGI in existence Worst acting Worst script Wrestlers shouldn't act because they are crap ACTORS I am surprised what director could have made this abomination of mankind. I am sure its worse than Batman and Robin. Just thinking of this film makes me sick. Why does it exist? Why? Why? If I could rate it a zero out of ten I would. Honestly its the worst thing I've ever seen. OH its that feeling when you see an ugly person and you cant do anything about it. This film makes me want to punch some thing. I want to punch everyone who gives it a high rating. Even a donkey could create better things than this. The soundtrack is crap as well. And its too long and painful to watch,The Scorpion King
329,ILuvTheBrkfstClb,This is the worst (hands down) movie that I've ever seen,1,11 December 2005,"Too many mullets, bad action, non-existent plot, not historically correct. Granted, I'm not a fan of the genre, so don't take my personal opinion to heart. If you love this movie, good for you. The first time I saw this movie, I laughed so hard that I almost died. Not at intentional jokes, but at the poor quality of the movie. I'd advise you not to see this if you were expecting a movie with a plot. This so-called ""plot"" was painful to watch unfold as the scantily-clad sorceress pranced around with strategically placed objects in front of her, and the oh-so obvious plot turns. If you are interested purely in action, sex and adventure than this movie is for you.",The Scorpion King
330,Defection,Unimaginative Boredom,3,20 November 2005,"The makers of this movie probably thought that half-nude women and well-oiled biceps automatically appeal to everyone since they actually didn't include a plot in this quite dreadful flick.The ""story"" is basically this: An assassin (The Rock) is hired to kill a seer who helps an evil tyrant take over the land. For some reason he doesn't terminate her , she falls in love with him and then they together start fighting the cruel dictator. It is still possible to accept this risible, though common plot, but the way it has been realized is simply mind-boggling.The largest credit for ruining this movie doesn't actually go to The Rock, but to the general atmosphere of the movie. You never sense that the leads are in any danger, the Scorpion King is simply too powerful, he can fight a dozen men at once, getting an arrow in his back doesn't slow him down and he can fall a hundred feet (smashing into a stone floor) without taking any damage. The epic scale found in e.g. Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings is nowhere to be found.Simply put, if the things I mentioned in beginning are your main reason for watching a movie than you might like it, otherwise keep your distance to this piece of crap.",The Scorpion King
