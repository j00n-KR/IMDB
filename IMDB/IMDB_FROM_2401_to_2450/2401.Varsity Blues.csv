0,bkoganbing,The Texas religion of football,7,11 July 2020,"Varsity Blues bear comparison with two other football related films. One is The
Last Picture Show set some 50 years before the action of this film. Not much has
changed in Texas in the passing years.The second is another high school football classic All The Right Moves with Tom
Cruise. Cruise and star James VanDerBeek are both 18 and about to graduate
frm high school.The scholarship that Cruise gets from football to an engineering school is his
ticket out of his drab Pennsylvania coal mining town. VanDerBeek plays football because it's expected of him. He's a second string quarterback but
is in the running for a scholarship on academics.Then first string quarterback Paul Walker is injured and it falls on VanDerBeek.
At that point we see what a lot of VanDerBeek's problem is and it's coach
Jon Voight.Like in every Texas small town the local football coach is the town's biggest
celebrity. But VanDerBeek s intelligent enough to see him for what he is a ruthless user of his players who doesn't care one wit about the young people
in his charge as long as they win for him and win his way.Gradually however some others start to see Voight for what he is. Te climax
is quite a revelation to Voight.Varsity Blues stands good comparison to the other high school football films
I mentioned and to others also. VanDerBeek and Voight lead a well cast film
that's quite a bit more than your usual teen flick.",Varsity Blues
1,SnoopyStyle,If only it was darker,6,27 January 2015,"It's West Canaan, Texas and high school football is king. Pressure is intense. John Moxon (James Van Der Beek) is the backup quarterback who spends his time in the game reading a book. Coach Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) hates his attitude and berates him for it. His girlfriend Julie Harbor (Amy Smart) is the sister of the star quarterback Lance (Paul Walker). Offensive lineman Billy Bob (Ron Lester) passes out and Lance gets hurt being sacked. John Moxon goes into the game, throws out the playbook and wins the game. Lance is out and his future is in doubt. Lance' girlfriend Darcy Sears (Ali Larter) starts trying to get Moxon. Soon Moxon's success starts to change him into a local star.This is basically the same plot points as 'Friday Night Lights'. The difference is that this movie keeps trying to play the outlandish for comedy. The movie misunderstands the inherit dark drama and tries to make a funny high school comedy out of it. The two clash and doesn't work together at all. This could have been a very good movie and spawn a TV show.",Varsity Blues
2,gavin6942,More Than Just Football,7,30 November 2015,"A back-up quarterback (James VanDerBeek) is chosen to lead a Texas football team to victory after the star quarterback (Paul Walker) is injured.I was never a football player. I was not fro ma town that cared about high school football. And I did not particularly care about the football team. Heck, I do not even happen to remember a single person who played on our school's team. So I do not exactly identify with anyone in this movie.And yet, it happens to be pretty good. VanDerBeek does not stray too far from Dawson, which is how we like him best. Paul Walker is here, which is great, since his legacy is pretty much only ""Fast and Furious"". And Jon Voight is sort of a jerk, which is exactly how I imagine he is in real life.",Varsity Blues
3,lee_eisenberg,I don't know anything about football. And why do we call it football if we don't play it with our feet?,5,20 March 2006,"While staying with a family in Queretaro, Mexico, in summer 1999, I saw ""Varsity Blues"" in the local cinema. Since I'm totally numb to anything sports-related, I only half absorbed the movie (I spent most of the time reading the subtitles). Teenage boys are likely to only take interest in the whipped cream bikini scene. But I do know that in Texas, football is king; my mom had unpleasant experiences with that growing up in Galena Park, Texas. Obviously, the problem with calling it football is that we don't play it with our feet; that's why most of the world calls ""football"" what we incomprehensibly call ""soccer"". All in all, I'll mainly remember James Van Der Beek and Ali Larter for co-starring in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"".",Varsity Blues
4,Quinoa1984,"Good, but",5,23 July 2000,"I liked this movie, but not enough to reccomend it.  It may be for some, but there is sort of a problem.  The drama in this film is very electrifyingly good is seemed worth.  But then the MTV comedy kicked in and made this film kinda, uh, stupid (but of course this film is done by MTV productions). Still, there are powerful performances, especially by newcomer Jmaes Van Der Beek and Jon Voight, who is terrific as the over-bearing coach (even though we might've seemed this before).  Not a waste of time, but there is better out there (don't worry though, this is Brian Robbins best film). A-",Varsity Blues
5,wes-connors,Whipped Cream & Other Rewrites,3,9 May 2010,"In the football-worshiping town of West Canaan, Texas, bench-warming James Van Der Beek (as Jonathan ""Mox"" Moxon) gets his chance to score when handsome blond quarterback Paul Walker (as Lance Harbor) is sidelined by injury. Hefty Ron Lester (as Billy Bob) and his pet pig ""Bacon"" give the film weighty fun. Horny Scott Caan (as Charlie Tweeder) adds latent homosexual laughs. Kept back in high school, the lads are pushed to the limit by loud-mouthed coach Jon Voight (as Bud Kilmer). There are plenty of shirt-shedding cheerleader types, hot for football muscle - especially luscious Ali Larter (as Darcy Sears) in a whipped cream bikini.*** Varsity Blues (1/15/99) Brian Robbins ~ James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight, Paul Walker, Ron Lester",Varsity Blues
6,michaelRokeefe,A somewhat realist view of high school football.,3,21 April 2000,"In a little town in the big state of Texas, high school football is to live and die for. The guts, the glory, the pride and the hero worshiping of a winning team is the most important thing in the world. A second string quarterback steps into the limelight, only to defy a ego maniacal coach.James Van Der Beek is the reluctant hero. Jon Voight is the idolized coach. Some of the finest high school athletes in and around Austin, Texas made the football scenes very realistic.To honor or dishonor. To quit or go against the grain. Friendship rules!! An unexpected pleasure to watch.",Varsity Blues
7,Uriah43,A Sports Movie with Unlikeable Characters,3,14 March 2019,"This film essentially involves a high school quarterback named ""Jonathon 'Mox' Moxon"" (James Van Der Beek) who lacks the talent of the starting quarterback ""Lance Harbor"" (Paul Walker) and is content to sit on the bench as he doesn't really care that much for the game. Part of the reason for this attitude involves the football coach by the name of ""Bud Kilmer"" (Joh Voight) who has been allowed to get away with extremely abusive behavior for 30 years at this high school due to the fact that he has won 2 state championships and 22 district titles. Unfortunately, when Lance is injured on the field one night it elevates Mox into a position of having to now play for a man he clearly does not respect--and Bud Kilmer is not a man to be crossed. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film had some possibilities but didn't quite realize its potential due mainly to the fact that none of the characters--other than perhaps the cheerleader named ""Darcy Sears"" (played by Ali Larter)--were very likeable to any degree. Likewise, the film itself was quite predictable as well. In any case, while this this film might appeal to viewers interested in a ""sports movie"" of this type, I didn't especially care for it that and have rated it accordingly. Below average.",Varsity Blues
8,anaconda-40658,Varsity Isn't Blue.,8,27 April 2015,"Varsity Blues (1999): Dir: Brian Robbins / Cast: James Van Der Beek, Jon Voight, Paul Walker, Ron Lester, Scott Caan: Sports comedy with screwball elements yet takes its theme seriously. It regards a football team that has lost its star quarterback to a leg injury and how James Van Der Beek steps in becoming their star player. His parents jerk him in several directions. His relationship with his girlfriend is in pearl. His best friend's girlfriend presents herself with whipped cream covering her vital areas. Sounds like he has his dating life well in hand. Coach Bud threatens to terminate his scholarship. Despite its familiar grounds this film is a must for football fans. Huge improvement for director Brian Robbins who previously made an embarrassing ham handed mess called Good Burger. Van Der Beek is effective as he attempts to figure out where his life is headed. Jon Voight steal scenes as Bud whom Van Der Beek confronts regarding particular conduct that moves the team ahead. Paul Walker plays the injured quarterback whom Van Der Beek replaces. Ron Lester brings comic relief as Van Der Beek's friend who ended up with more concussions than needed. Another comic performance is from the wild antics of Scott Caan that are this side of breaking the law. Great combination of football action combined with screwball comedy and a strong theme regarding the illegal operations to succeed. Score: 8 / 10",Varsity Blues
9,Wuchakk,Very entertaining sports movie,8,22 June 2013,"Released in 1999, ""Varsity Blues"" is a sports film about football in Central Texas, where high school football is virtually a religion. I was surprised at how engrossing and entertaining ""Varsity Blues"" is, much more so than similar films, like ""Remember the Titans"" (2000), ""Woodlawn"" (2015) and scores of others.The story revolves around a second-string quarterback, Mox (James Van Der Beek), who doesn't take football too seriously because he's consigned to the bench, but when the team's star-quarterback is seriously injured (Paul Walker), Mox rises to the challenge and begins to experience all the perks that come with being the football hero of the town.I'm not a huge fan of sports film, unless they successfully tap into other genres. ""Varsity Blues"" does this and is part high school dramedy. The movie features everything you'd want in a film of this ilk -- the sexpot cheerleader (Ali Larter), wild schoolmates (Scott Caan, Ron Lester), the smart girl (Amy Smart, no pun intended), wild parties, miscellaneous coming-of-age antics, megalomaniac coach (Jon Voight) and everything that goes with intense sports competition.Some people complain that the film's unrealistic because of all the extreme things that occur, but the team in ""Varsity Blues"" represents the typical champion high school football team and therefore they experience the various crazy things these types of teams encounter in real life. It was the same thing with ""Platoon."" Veterans of Vietnam say no one platoon would undergo all that this platoon experienced, but the group is a microcosm of all platoons throughout the Vietnam war. Also, movies like ""Varsity Blues"" and ""Platoon"" may come across as ""too much"" because filmmakers only have about 2 hours to tell the story and they have to jam a whole year of experiences into that time frame.Others complain about the lack of assistant coaches in the second half of the final game, but we'll have to assume that they went with a certain person and the film just doesn't show it. I rate ""Varsity Blues"" as high as I do because it's a stand-out sports film and high school dramedy that heavily influenced the more reality-based (but IMO less compelling) ""Friday Night Lights,"" which came out five years later. No genre is beyond redemption or above contempt.The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in the Austin, TX, area (Georgetown, Elgin and Taylor). DIRECTOR: Brian Robbins. WRITER: W. Peter Iliff. GRADE: A-",Varsity Blues
10,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Sometimes good, sometimes a little too much",5,5 August 2006,"I'm not really into football movies I have to admit, the only one's I make an exception for is Adam Sandler's flicks because they are comedies. Varsity Blues is more of a teen drama and the Dawson's Creek lovers, due to James Vander Beek, or whatever his name is. While the movie is pretty good and inspirational, the accents were a little thrown off from time to time. Not to mention it was pretty predictable. John Voight was pretty good, just again, his character was a little too much. Being an American, I know we take our football games pretty seriously, but, I didn't need to know that much.While you still cheer for the coyotes, it's a fun movie to watch sometimes. I could see where some people would like this movie. Including Regina George. :D See Mean Girls to get that reference. So either you're going to love it, like it, or hate it. You make the choice.5/10",Varsity Blues
11,Buddy-51,a cliché ridden film,2,3 July 1999,"""Varsity Blues"" is a tedious, shallow and formulaic tale of small town high school football hijinks wherein the adults are even more developmentally disabled than the hormone-crazed teenagers they've produced.The film manages to encompass just about every cliché endemic to this well-worn genre. There is, for instance, the maniacal coach, driving his players to dangerous extremes on the field and circumventing sound medical advice for his own personal glory; the overbearing fathers obsessively attempting to recapture their former glory through their pumped-up progeny; the crybaby fat boy who throws up buckets of food at the seemingly numberless drunken orgies the boys participate in; the sensible boy whose head is not turned by sudden fame and fortune; and the supportive football-hating girlfriend who tries to keep her sweetie in tow despite his sudden ascension to the rank of football hero. All this doesn't take into account the bubbleheaded sexpot sex ed teacher who moonlights at the local strip joint; the befuddled cops; the drunken, smart-mouthed jock who hijacks a cop car and spends the evening joyriding through town with a bevy of naked, nubile girls from the neighborhood; or the horny young lady who dresses down and splashes on a whipped cream bikini only to be rejected by the pure-in-heart hero.Then we arrive at the final game and the unconvincing showdown between the villainous coach and the righteously rebellious players led by the hero Moxon. Who will be victorious? If you have to ask, perhaps this is your first time at one of these movies. As this is an MTV movie production, the football scenes are, of course, pumped up with a blaring rock soundtrack that tries in vain to get the adrenalin flowing or the emotions charged. The major hindrance to this film comes down to the simple fact that none of these characters or situations convey the slightest aura of reality or believability. For a far better, struggling-to-get-out-of-small-town-America film, check out 1999's ""October Sky"" or 1983's ""All The Right Moves.""",Varsity Blues
12,g-bodyl,Predictable but Good!,9,8 July 2013,"Varsity Blues is a very predictable football drama that is very similar in tone and style to 2004's Friday Night Lights. While I like that film better, this is not a bad film at all. I was still able to root for and against some characters. This movie does a good job at holding my attention and bringing back some good high school memories.Brian Robbin's film is about a Texas football team in the town of West Canaan. After the star quarterback is injured, the back up guy, Moxon is forced to deal with his relentless coach Kilmer, his disapproving girlfriend, and his football-loving parents while starting in his new role that is all strange for him.The acting is pretty good. This is the first time I saw James Van Der Beek on film because I refuse to watch Dawson's Creek, but he does a pretty good job. Jon Voight gives a masterful performance as Kilmer and he just made me despise the character. Paul Walker does a good job and he does not even drive any cars! Overall, this may be a clichéd sports film, but there are some subtle differences such as scenes involving whipped cream, religious little brothers, and a health teacher who is much more than that. Despite some flaws, I couldn't help but root for the Moxon kid. I rate this film 9/10.",Varsity Blues
13,A_Different_Drummer,Mainly because of Voight,8,30 July 2016,"I will start by confessing that I have a weakness for football flicks. As a seasoned reviewer, I have over the years come to really admire the fact that American ""football"" films are not part of a single brand franchise tied to a particular studio but, rather, that any independent film-maker with a good script and financing can throw his hat in the ring. And produce something that may or may not pass the test of time.Varsity Blues will hold up. And mainly because of Voight. (Of the rest of the cast only Amy Smart manages to steal scenes.) Voight is one of the American film industry's most neglected resources, I think. I remember a long time ago, after his breakout role in Midnight Cowboy, I was able to catch Voight doing a stage play in upstate New York. What I remember about that was the impression of how serious this guy was about mastering his craft. If there was no movie deal on the table, he would go find a stage on which to perfect his craft.And what a craft. This reviewer believes that Voight could be the finest living character actor in Hollywood. And also the most forgettable since -- most people forget this -- the job of the character actor is never steal thunder from the stars.This film was done in 1999. This review was written in 2016 where, week after week, an older Voight continues to steal scenes from the leads in the hi-quality Ray Donovan TV show.I am a fan of Ray Donovan, mainly because of Voight.And I think this film is better than the reviews indicate.Mainly because of Voight.",Varsity Blues
14,The-Sarkologist,The religion of sport,8,27 December 2013,"In America we have laws to make this country run, in the town of West Canaan we have a law all of our own. This is how the movie Varsity Blues begins. It instantly lets you know that the town of West Canaan is somewhat different and it runs by a different set of rules. These rules are the rules of footballs and the players in the Coyotes are gods.Varisty Blues shows us a town where football fever has become a religion and the football oval is the temple to their god, but their gods change frequently: for when the star player becomes severely injured, he vanishes to be replaced by another hero, and this time a reluctant one. What we see in Varsity Blues is a religion that exists - but the movie forces it out. Every football season here in Adelaide everybody goes Crow fanatic (the Crows are one of Adelaide's two football teams).The thing with football here is that there is a lot of hypocrisy - when the team is on a loosing streak everybody hates them and have even booed them off of the field, while when they are on a winning streak, everybody dresses up in red, yellow, and blue, and goes hysterical over them. When confronted with this they claim that they followed the Crows through thick and thin - though we know that this is not true. What I don't like about football is that people will literally throw their responsibilities away when a game is on.Back to Varsity Blues - this movie emphasises the hypocrisy that surrounds football. The religious aspect is brought out with Mox's younger brother who is really deeply religious. He creates his own cult and his father's reply is ""I don't want to see any more of this - you are going to play football like your brother."" Parents fight over who's son is the better football player, and all of them had the same coach - who literally runs the town.Mox is an interesting fellow because he loves football, but detests the way the town idolises it. He states that what he is watching is a corruption of a good thing. He is more interested in a college degree in something that he likes, but his brilliant throw is forcing him to play football and to go down a career path that he does not want to go down. Moreso the coach is forcing the players to play until they are useless. He does not care about his team-member's health: he is more interested in winning. Unfortunately for the players, they are becoming crippled and being placed in very complicated and expensive surgery - and once they are gone then they have fallen from grace: this is clearly seen when Lance destroys his knee and his girlfriend leaves him for Mox.Varsity Blues is a bit of a slutty movie, but it addresses a very important issue in our society - the way we idolise a sport and place mere mortals upon a pedestal, only to throw them away when they are no longer needed. I agree with Mox - sport is fun and enjoyable, but it becomes corrupted when people start treating it like a religion.",Varsity Blues
15,Dr_Coulardeau,Of course it could have been better,8,9 January 2011,"You have the right to say: one more high school varsity football film. And it has absolutely all the defects of these films: the kids are unthinkable non-thinking machines. At first at least. The coach is a brute that dopes his players or gives them unethical injections for them to play even when they should not. He is a gross character who treats his players as if they were in a marine training camp and he were a training sergeant as depicted by some films about the Vietnam war. Gross language, blackmailing, violence even are some of his skins on top of the illegal stuff and unethical actions.But the film reveals two elements that are essential to understand this sport is not exactly and only that. First the fathers are shown as being pure idiots who want their children to play football for only two reasons: because they played football when they were going to that particular high school themselves. They are frankly undrinkable nostalgic-spirited bigots about football. And the second reason is that their sons can earn, or win, a full scholarship in college, alleviating the expense for the family. That transforms football into some kind of narrow-minded culture, not to speak of open institutionalized moral prostitution or slavery.The teenagers are well obliged, willy-nilly for some, to play the game which means violence, superficial clichés and attitudes including racism against the only black on the team, sexism and hefty male-chauvinistic attitudes, some girls overplaying the game by becoming the prize of each game for the winner. Not to speak of alcohol and other inacceptable practices including public or semi-public sex, driving under the influence, drinking binges and challenges, and even some open and gross misdemeanor. This film becomes then some kind of a manifesto against that absurd and inhumane culture.But the film also shows how the initial quarterback is the victim of some medical mishandling from the coach, and how he will in the last game of the season support his ""substitute"" that leads that game to a direct confrontation of the whole team with the coach. This coach is on the point of forcing the only black player to accept an injection in his knee to go back on the field. The substitute quarterback tells the black player not to do it and he quits when he is menaced by the coach. But he had built a new spirit in the team putting the black chap in the front and using several other tactics that were creative and valorizing for other players than himself, or the coach. The team then refuses to go back for the second half of the game and the coach is forced to leave. The players then take over: the ex- and the new quarterbacks together, the ex- assuming the coach's position. And the rest is the good ending.Football, like all other sports, could be a beautiful adventure for the players all the time if some coaches did not use the system to valorize themselves by over exploiting the players. But apart from what I have said, yes it is another high school varsity football film.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID",Varsity Blues
16,Anonymous_Maxine,Yet another routine football movie.,5,21 July 2002,"Varsity Blues is the sports version of the recent barrage of teen horror movies that we've been flogged with over the last decade or so. It is a completely recycled version of the age-old sport film plot, with a hero at the top of his game who becomes injured just enough to allow an underdog to come in and become a hero himself, but not quite enough to prevent him from retaining some hero status by coaching the team to victory. I'll go ahead and give the obligatory spoilers warning now, although Varsity Blues is one of those movies where you really know what's going to happen from the beginning. Given that, we should concentrate more on the way that we're told a story that we already essentially know, but even that is not very interesting. We get to see plenty of actors in their mid twenties pretend like they're high school kids doing freaky high school things, but we are never for a second able to look away from the fact that these are actors. Nothing is real in the film because none of the actors are fit to play the roles of high school kids. Let's consider a few ages, James Van Der Beek was about 22 years old when he took on the role of Jonathon Moxon. Amy Smart is 23 years old in the film, Ron Lester, the charmer who played Billy Bob, was 24, Scott Caan was also about 23, as was Ali Larter when she donned the infamous whipped cream bikini, and for crying out loud, Paul Walker was freaking 26!! It's easy to see that they wanted to cast more well known actors to play the roles of these kids in the movie because they wanted to guarantee a certain box-office value, but these actors ended up removing any sense of believability from the movie. It should be kept in mind that often the greatest films are the ones that go out on a limb and cast unknown actors in extraordinary situations. It's too bad that familiarity was deemed more important than believability in this movie, because with only a little bit of plot work, Varsity Blues could have been an enormously better film. 
The movie is peppered with frustrating situations that don't fit with the rest of the movie. Jonathon Moxon is a high school kid who is more mature than any high school kid in the world. I guess they wanted to deliver a message about getting a real education rather than just focusing on something like football at the expense of your grades, but no high school kid on the planet would hesitate for a second to be the starting quarterback on the school football team, especially when the football team is the biggest thing in the town, just so he can concentrate on his grades or his girlfriend or anything else. I played high school football, and being one of the best players on the football team in high school is like being a rock star (although I don't know this from personal experience!). 
In general, although I am definitely a red-blooded American male, I tend to frown on unnecessary nudity in the movies. There is a place for unnecessary nudity  hell, there's a whole friggin' genre for it!  but the problem is that there are way too many movies released these days that use nudity to pull along a weak script, and the script of Varsity Blues is so weak that it's pretty much a guarantee that this is why we saw so much nudity in the film. I can't say that it was entirely unappreciated, but it was obvious that there was a whipped cream bikini and a stolen cop car full of naked high school girls and a stripping teacher in the film because the story and plot were little more than recycled garbage. Besides that, the movie doesn't even seem to want to have nudity in it. It's like it wants to show just enough to keep our eyelids from drooping, but not enough to allow us to notice that it knows how weakly written it is. Any scene involving nudity is accompanied simultaneously with awkward discomfort, hinting that the movie doesn't know what to do with nudity or that it doesn't really want it to be there at all. There's nothing new presented in Varsity Blues, it is yet another presentation of the same old thing that we've seen in countless football movies before, and in this case, it is even acted universally by actors who don't fit their roles. The only person who pulls any weight in the film is John Voigt, which is rather unfortunate because of the person he plays. Voigt is one of the better actors working today, and he is amazingly good at playing people that are wonderfully hate-able, it's just too bad that the only person that is at all convincing in the entire movie is a character that is meant to be disliked. Leaves you with a bad aftertaste, which is unfortunate for the staying power of the film, but not exactly unfitting with its quality.",Varsity Blues

19,davispittman,My favorite sports movie,9,2 August 2017,"OK so I hate sports, I mean I really do, hate watching football, always have and always will. So I really didn't originally think that I would enjoy this movie, but to my surprise I really enjoyed it. I don't usually ever like sports movies since I hate sports, but this movie is much more layered than you may think. It's loaded with drama, romance, friendship, important messages, and admirable characters. It's not a hyper masculine movie about men playing football. It has detailed characters dealing with their lives and all that entails. The cast is great. James Van Der Beek gives a fantastic performance and proves himself to be more than just the star of a teenage drama (Dawson's Creek). Scott Caan is good here too, and no I'm not just talking about his ass lol, now that's fine as hell, but that's not all he is in this film, he provides a nice comic relief and plays a very fun outgoing character. Paul Walker (RIP) is great here, I loved his character and he proved himself as an actor early here. Rock on Paul, we miss you xoxo. Jon voight is great as the villainous football coach, he plays it very well, if you don't hate him as a character then there's something wrong with you lol. Ali Larter and Amy Smart are both good too. I loved Beek and Smart's romantic chemistry. The script is well put together, I love the deep interesting dialogue between the characters. The script made me connect more with each of the characters. I was sincerely hoping this film wouldn't be a bland testosterone filled sports movie that is just dumb, and my hopes were meet satisfaction. This is the best sports movie ever in my opinion. 9/10.",Varsity Blues

Rest was chock-full of stereotypes and the story has been done since the dawn of mankind.Still, James Van Der Beek gives it all he has and made the whole thing tolerable.

They balance the drama which is very important considering the plot of the film and it characters plus the comedy helps that will make you laugh.The story is very good as it will keep your interest from the start of the film and if you love Football this is what you will enjoy.The acting is very well matched as again the cast worked very well together and you can feel them giving their A game in terms of performances. Music is very good as well and you'll enjoy the songs that are on the soundtrackVarsity Blues shows the drama of what football in Texas can be like and how it effects everyone from your friends to your family this teen drama really showcases what High School is like when you're a Football player and how you are seenThe film deserves more credit then it gets so do yourself a favor and watch this film not only if you're a fan of the cast members but if you are a fan of Football and drama filmsI give Varsity Blues an 8 out of 10",Varsity Blues
23,baumer,"Excellent film, and that whip cream bikini!",9,23 August 1999,"May contain spoilers:Even though my experience differs in the type of sport, I can completely relate and appreciate what the core of this film is about.  And that is the compulsive, hereditary, obsessive behavior that peers and parents have towards their kids playing sports.  I have lived in Canada all my life in what would be considered somewhere in between a city like New York and a town like West Canaan.  Take a look at Springfield Illinois (pop. about 300,000) and that is about the size of the cities that I have grown up in. And when I have been to and played hockey at local small rinks, parents become stupid.  They yell at the refs, there is sometimes the threat of violence and really it is sheer luncacy that prevails at events like this one.  Is it that they try to live vicariously through their kids?  That they want to see their kids do something that they never could?  Besides Kilmer being an idiot and a control freak in the film, I thought Varsity Blues' central issue was to show how obsessed we all are when it comes to sports and our kids achieving greatness, at any level.Varsity Blues is a great film.  And what I enjoyed most about it was the acting and the football scenes.  James VDB shows that he is capable of playing someone other than Dawson Leery.  And his range in here is perfect. It also has to be mentioned that if this film was taken more seriously than it was, then I really think that John Voigt would be up for an Oscar nomination for his role as the control freak Bud Kilmer.  He is the embodiment of an American football coach that seems to care only about his reputation and not his player's welfare.  His southern, red neck twang, his pretencious gum chewing, his snarl when he barks orders and his domination of the entire town just by a simple comment made in a local diner shows how versatile and understanding of an actor that Voigt is.  Coincidentally, I had just rented Anaconda two days before I saw this on Viewers Choice, and I was truly amazed at the range by Voigt.  He really is terrific in this film. I also have to mention Ron Lester who plays Billy Bob, the guargantuanly over weight line backer with a heart of gold.  At first when we meet him he is a caricature of every other over weight star athlete.  He eats fatty foods like they were going out of style, he is the life of the party as he pukes and then comes back for more and he is one of the guys.  But later in the film we see his character grow.  There is more to his character than we initially see, and when he is given an opportunity to act, he is perfect as we see how he feels and how hurt he is.  This really should be a breakout role for him.  Varsity Blues has some of the best football action I've ever seen filmed. The plays are realistic looking, the hits are violent and the symmetry of the completed plays are awesome to watch.  This is a film that makes you feel like you are really watching a high school football game.There is really nothing wrong with Varsity Blues and if you enjoy highschool themes like relationships and humour then you will probably love this film. And there is one more thing to love about this film, well two actually, if you are a guy that is.  Ms. Davis and Darcy Sears.  That whip cream bikini is something I'll never forget.  What a dish.",Varsity Blues
24,DunnDeeDaGreat,Great football film,6,21 December 2001,"Varsity Blues has to be one of the truest films about high school football ever made.

James Van Der Beek is great in the lead role as Mox, although I would have gotten with Jules if I were him. Check this one out with friends.",Varsity Blues
25,mattymatt4ever,Surprisingly good!,8,8 April 2001,"If someone checks out the trailer, one might think, ""Another MTV-produced teen flick.  I think I'll pass on that.""  Well, I went into the theater not thinking it was going to be bad, but I expected more of an amusing film that isn't really high on ingenuity.  True, ""Varsity Blues"" has those standard teen elements like wild drinking parties, the school slut, etc.  But it never overuses those elements.  It's more of a compelling comedy-drama about football that delivers a fine message about sportsmanship.  You have a pretty good idea how it's going to end up, but it's the way it's executed that makes it special.  Jon Voight is absolutely terrific as the no-nonsense coach.  He's the kind of character you want to stab in the chest every minute he's on screen, and Voight was a perfect choice.  The film dabbles with elements of the sport that probably hit home to some high school football players.  Voight's character has only one goal: winning.  And he doesn't care how he gets to that goal.  If he has to shoot drugs into every one of his players, he's going to arrive at that goal.  And I'm sure there are coaches out there who have that selfish goal.  Then James Van Der Beek comes along, and his character is not really concerned with winning or playing football in the first place.  But he likes football, has fun with it and simply wants to play a good, honest game.  If the team wins, good.  If it doesn't, so what.  He has a good locker room speech at the end of the movie.  ""Varsity Blues"" is funny, moving and wonderfully acted.  It might appeal more to teens and young adults, more than the older ones, but I still suggest everyone check it out.",Varsity Blues
26,hall895,Doesn't stand out from the crowd,6,22 January 2015,"Varsity Blues is about as predictable a movie as you will ever see. It's a movie about high school football which is pretty much like every other movie about high school football. Every cliché of the genre is here. The overbearing coach. The football-obsessed town. The parents living vicariously through their children. The players who see football as their only means of escape. The intellectual player who realizes there's more to life than football. The cheerleader who just wants to be with the star, whoever the star may be at a given moment. The big, fat guy who's there for comic relief. The injury that changes everything. The big game at the end. Did I miss any? Oh yes, of course, the biggest cliché of all...Texas. Where else would you set a movie about a town where high school football is the only thing that matters?So you know what you're in for with this movie. Nothing is going to surprise you here. But as predictable and formulaic as it is Varsity Blues still provides reasonably decent entertainment. The characters may all be clichéd but a number of them still manage to be compelling. James Van Der Beek is the star of the movie, if not the football team. He plays the intellectual backup quarterback, Mox, a guy who plays football not because he wants to but because it is what he is expected to do. Mox's situation changes, how Mox responds to that change is the crux of the movie's rather simple story. Van Der Beek's performance is by no means extraordinary but for this movie it works perfectly fine. He creates a character we can relate to and root for. And Jon Voight, playing the thoroughly detestable Coach Bud Kilmer, does an excellent job creating a character we can despise and root against. Kilmer is a hard-driving jerk, a man who cares only about winning football games. He cares not how many young bodies he must destroy to win another district championship. The conflict between Mox, who gets what life is really about, and Kilmer, who most certainly does not, is quite dramatic. And if a high school football movie can give you some good drama that's really all you can ask. There is nothing spectacular about Varsity Blues. There is nothing that really sets it apart from all the other movies of its type you have already seen. But it is at least entertaining enough to be worth your while. There are good dramatic moments, a few good laughs, some compelling characters. And some rather inventively used whipped cream. It may not rise above its genre but for what it is, and all it was ever meant to be, Varsity Blues is a success.",Varsity Blues

And, if they are done well, I end up loving them to death, like this one. What an excellent look at the American Religion of Sports! It really shows how disillusioned men stuck in their own lives live through the successes and failures of their sons, especially on the playing field. Such men are worse than stage mothers. Maybe they should have a term like ""Sports Fathers."" You know what I mean. Voight was excellent as the ultimate bullying coach, and Van Der Beek as the high school senior who is a decent guy who is wise beyond his years.

30,witster18,call me crazy...but better than FNLights...if only because it's more entertaining,7,18 July 2007,"The characters are interesting.. as is the plot. The football scenes are realistic and well-shot. James Vanderbeek and Jon Voigt do a fantastic job as coach/player adversaries. This film exceeds it's follow-up films(like Friday Nt Lts) with a sharp, realistic and character driven script. The viewer gets swept up by this small group of friends. Unlike similar films, the group is small and well-defined and their interaction seems genuine, as well as entertaining. THis film doesn't deserve this under 6 ranking....no way. By the climax of the film the viewer is extremely interested in the fate of the group. The finale doesn't disappoint...much like the film as a whole. Of course it's a little teeny bopper, but it's about teenagers...something everyone needs to remember when critiquing this film. A guilty pleasure that we would all love to hate.. but can't. Perhaps because it reminds us of our HS years more than we'd like to admit. Much better than the ranking here. 75/100The music in the climax is masterfully edited.The way the final game puts closure to nearly every subplot really makes it much, much better than anyone might suspect.You'll like it if you liked: Friday Night LIghts, All The Right Moves, and Any Given Sunday.",Varsity Blues

However, thanks to a generally intelligent script and a great job by Jon Voight, this turned out to be surprisingly good.  As you would probably expect in a teen movie, there are some scenes that seem juvenile and pointless, but thankfully, this film manages to limit these needless diversions.  The central story, although a familiar one, is well written and rather interesting.  Definitely worth checking out.",Varsity Blues

The film is a little mixed early on as it flirts with teenage humour, but it course corrects later. The film is better when it deals with the competitive nature of sport in small towns. The final third of this movie is the best part and saves an odd film narrative from being completely overshadowed by teenage cheap humour.",Varsity Blues
33,caa821,"Excellent film - with a couple of ""bonuses""",9,26 August 2006,"I like movies where you can enjoy them on different levels - in addition to the story and acting, per se. This movie, for me, is one of those. I love football flicks, and this was a good one. In terms of the football scenes, it may not quite be the equivalent of ""North Dallas Forty,"" but the latter is the finest such film ever made. The performances of the actors playing the primary six high-schoolers, along with Jon Voight, were all engaging and well-performed. And besides the drama and the story, there were two other aspects of this presentation which I thoroughly enjoyed, as a ""bonus.""1. Jon Voight, whose work I have always enjoyed, with another performance or two leading a sports team, may win a ""title"" I never thought could be taken from the current holder. He could surpass the fine actor, G. D. Spradlin, as ""the greatest horse's ass coach in the history of film!"" (Spradlin was splendid in this capacity as the coach in both the fore-mentioned ""North Dallas Forty,"" and as the basketball coach in Robby Benson's ""One-on-One."")2. In ""The Natural"" and ""The Rookie,"" baseball movies starring Robert Redford and Dennis Quaid, respectively - each played a character (one fictional, one real), about 10 years younger than the actual age of the actor. This, however, is not surprising, given both of their good-looks and fitness. And makeup, lighting and camera work permit performers to regress or advance in ages portrayed (e.g. the great age span of Hoffman's character in ""Little Big Man""). On the other hand, I found it engrossingly fascinating, viewing the six primary ""high-schoolers"" here, versus the actor's real ages at time of the film's release. Footballer Van Der Beck was the ""baby"" at 22, Caan 23, Walker 25 or 26, and Lester 29, perhaps 30. The two female leads, Amy Smart (Van Der Beck's girlfriend), and Ali Larter (the little sexpot cheerleader) were both 23. Overall, everyone in this group would have been out of college for more than a year or two, and two of them in the post-college workforce long enough to have received a promotion or two in their jobs. But also interesting is that all of these were believable as high school seniors - neither detracting from the enjoyment of this fine movie, nor the fascination of this age discrepancy.",Varsity Blues

James Van Der Beek of TV's ""Dawson's Creek"" is very good in his first big movie role as Jonathan Moxon, or Mox for short, the second string quarterback who takes over the starter position after the starting quarterback gets injured. The thing I like best about ""Varsity Blues"" is the acting by the young actors. In addition to Van Deer Beek, there are good performances turned in by Paul Walker as Lance Harbor, the starting quarterback and Mox's best friend, Ron Lester as the huge Billy Bob, Amy Smart as Jules, Mox's girlfriend and Lance's sister, Ali Larter as Darcy, Lance's girlfriend and a cheerleader who starts to put the moves on Mox, and especially Scott Caan as the wild and crazy Charlie Tweeder. Oscar winner Jon Voight goes over the top as Bud Kilmer, their mean-spirited head coach. I would have liked it better if the writer hadn't made Voight so mean. His temper tantrums got on my nerves at times while watching this film. At times I wanted to scrape him off the screen with a spatula. Nevertheless, ""Varsity Blues"" works because of the performances by the young actors. There are some silly comedy moments that are rather unbelievable, but who cares.

36,chrisbrown6453,"Varsity Blues tells the story of a high school in a small town in Texas, where football is king.",8,19 June 2002,"I'm sure we've all known of, or at least heard of places, where nothing is bigger than high school football. The starting quarterback runs the town, the coach is considered a God (as long as he's winning), and the parents all live vicariously through their children. And most of the time, the kids actually playing football love the game too. But in the small town of West Caanan, the kids are running rampant, and the coach (Jon Voight) doesn't care. James Van Der Beek stars as Jonathon Moxon (Mox), the backup quarterback of the high school football team. And he's happy with his situation. He gets to sit on the sidelines and read, hang out with the cool kids, and basically just wait until he can get out of this one horse town and head off to Brown University. But one day he sees the coach injecting pain killers into the knee of the starting quarterback. Then one of his best friends, Billy Bob, seems to have a concussion, but the coach makes him play. When the starting QB goes down, Mox is handed the team and is forced to decide whether to be the King of West Caanan, or to live his life the way he wants it to be lived. I guess it wasn't a bad movie. The football scenes were done extremely well, and I generally liked the people I was supposed to like, and didn't like the people I wasn't supposed to like. But the movie lacked a certain focus. There were too many other things going on that didn't seem to have anything to do with the movie. The whole stripper/teacher thing didn't do anything but make me think back to my high school years and realize I didn't want to see any of those teachers naked. Then there was the black running back who claimed that the coach was a racist. He said that whenever they got near the goal line, the coach would always give the ball to a white guy so he could soak up the glory. While that may have been true, there was nothing in the movie to show that the coach was a racist. The only thing in the movie that said he was a racist was the black player saying he was. The whole race issue seemed to be thrown in there just for the sake of having it, rather than serving any purpose. Some of the characters were too stereotypical. Mox's girlfriend for instance. As soon as Mox became the starting QB, his life started to change. In the town of West Caanan, starting QB was a position of popularity. But instead of letting Mox enjoy himself, even for a second, she started telling him he had changed. I figured that was going to happen, but don't you think a girlfriend would allow her boyfriend to enjoy his moment in the spotlight for just a few minutes before telling him he's not the man she fell in love with? Jon Voight's character was another one. I never played high school football, so maybe that's the way a coach is, but actually willing to ruin a kids life by making him play with a serious injury? And actually choking another player? I thought that his character went a little too far. It made him look extremely bad when that point had already been made.My last rant has to do with the character of Darcy. She was the cheerleader who was dating the starting QB. As soon as he got injured, she started hitting on Mox. When she finally got him to come over to her house, he resisted her. Then she broke down and cried, and Mox solved all her problems in a few seconds. Much too quick a resolution for her. But I must say, I'll never look at whipped cream the same way again. Overall I did enjoy Varsity Blues. It was fun to watch, even though it had a lot of script problems. The actors seemed to be having fun with their roles, and that made the movie better. So even though it had a lot of problems, overall it was enjoyable. And now, I'm off to find some whipped cream.",Varsity Blues

A boring cliche. The sex parts were much better and reminded me of ""Porky's"". They were funny and sexy and could have held the movie together, putting the football stuff in the background story, perhaps making Jon Voight's character just an annoying football coach who would constantly be a victim of their pranks. Instead we're left with a would-be smart movie that just doesn't have the impact it could have, because it tries to show us how football coaches tyrannize their players.

Some of the blocks and hits that happened wasn't as loud, very up close and so fiecre in Oliver Stone's pro football epic ""Any Given Sunday"".""Varsity Blues"" isn't great, yet it's a solid and interesting football tale of Mox(James Van Der Beek) a local teen who is given the opportunity of a lifetime - becoming a well-known high school quarterback during one game when the team's first string QB and team leader, Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) is knocked out of the game (and season) with a torn knee ligament (ACL or MCL).  The team's fiery head coach, Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight) has no choice but to let Mox in as the QB.Unlike any other quarterback who follows the coach's orders, Mox takes matters into his own hands.  I could say it looks like it's not a big deal, but after seeing Kilmer's reaction after Mox scores the game-winning touchdown.  He clearly sees Mox as a threat to take his team in another direction.One of the tactics that Mox uses is absolutely funny when he intentionally throws the ball right at an opposing team's mascot. Although it wasn't nice, it is funny, that I'll confess.The film's second half is good as the first as Mox tries to convince one of his friends, Billy Bob (Ron Lester), a Gilbert Brown-like offensive lineman to stop drinking and suit for the season's last game. How Billy Bob admit that he failed to protect Lance when Kilmer told him to do is very touching.The last game is fun to watch even though there's the typical last minute drive and the speech by Mox, which is seriously good and very understanding.The last scene that Voight has when he's alone in his office and he sadly looks at a trophy that he earned.  He's not only saddened and heart-broken, but shows a look of regret and it's quiet yet powerful.Van Der Beek gives a decently good performance and Voight is terrific as Kilmer.  The supporting performances are fairly good, most notably Lester, Scott Caan, Amy Smart, and Ali Larter.  Director Brian Robbins made a serious and worthwhile effort to make this film look good and he does with some beautiful shots of the stadium by Chuck Cohen, the cinematographer and the editing by Ned Bastille.  Those shots were neat and well-done.What could have made ""Varsity Blues"" a better movie if it didn't show some very sickening jokes and a few amusing pranks that try to mock ""Animal House"".

41,D_Burke,Most Unrealistic High School Football Movie Ever,4,4 February 2008,"I'm really glad that ""Friday Night Lights"" was released in 2004. It didn't make quite as big a splash as ""Varsity Blues"", but it was a much better movie in terms of quality, and it had far more realistic characters and settings. Being a former high school football player, I get very picky when it comes to high school sports movies, especially about football. ""Varsity Blues"" had some good qualities, but was an overall miss for me.The biggest problem with ""Varsity Blues"" was that to me it was less of a sports movie and more of a frat house comedy knock-off with cheesy dramatic elements thrown in for desperate attempts at artistic credibility. As much as I like Jon Voight, I really didn't buy him as the coach. He was just too over-the-top; too unnecessarily evil to the point where he was a cliché. Sure he's concerned with winning. I mean, what good coach isn't? But did he have to be a steroid-injecting racist too? I also didn't buy the fact that he seemed to be the only coach on the team. For a team that big, you would think there would be some assistant coaches.James Van Der Beek is an actor I also usually like. He does play a likable guy in this movie, and often times plays his naivety very well. However, he completely lost it for me during that stupid attempt at an Oscar nomination (""I don't want your life!""). Plus, the part in the movie where he takes his teammates out to a strip club the night before a big game was never explained. He was supposed to play a smart kid! Smart kids don't do that! In relation to that, there were so many things wrong with that strip club segment of the movie. For one, they lost the game that came next (despite the opposing team appearing to be super human and making some hits that pale in comparison to most NFL teams), yet still made it to the State Championships in the end? That doesn't happen. Also, no one seemed to have a problem with the beginning part where the football player who got drunk, naked, and stole a police car with four other nude women in it. Yeah, it's funny, but if that happened in reality, the football player would have been convicted on five felony accounts. That would have been AFTER he was kicked off the team too.If the producers wanted to make a good high school football movie, they could have. Instead, they made a cheap flick which appealed to the MTV Generation with football players who were too perfect, and scenarios that would be almost guaranteed to never happen in real life. ""Friday Night Lights"" was to me a much better high school football movie, and not necessarily about beautiful people with problems. ""Varsity Blues"" is just a fluke.",Varsity Blues

The part that seemed unbelievable to me was the 'alcohol', and the getting into a 'go-go' bar for a late 90's film. Maybe I don't know Texas as well as I should, but I think Texas is included in the United States and the 21 year old legal drinking age, so the ability to get alcohol so freely under age and the ability to create debauchery at their age wasn't real to me. I think it was way over-exaggerated and unnecessary. Parental guidance was pretty non-existent here, but it was all about the football and alcohol, I guess.

An accident with the quarterback gets Mox promoted to that position, and suddenly he is worshiped by his town and the head cheerleader.  However, all Mox wants to do is study and get into a good college.  This deeply upsets his coach (Voight) who is played with such pure evil, that one has to wonder why he has kept his job.  He threatens Mox's chances to get into Brown unless he plays, and Mox's parents are indifferent, they only seem to care about high school football.  When the push comes to shove, you can guess what actually happens.  While all the actors try very hard with this movie, the movie itself is so wrapped in formula that it makes it completely unbeleivable.  I realize there are towns that live and die with high school sports, but the people of this town are presented as such simpletons that they overlook incredibly abusive and dangerous life-threatening behavior of a coach because he wins football games.

He will let nothing stand in his way, from injecting star players with drugs so that they can play, even though they are risking permanent injury, to making threats that will destroy scholarship chances. Kilmer is so powerful in the community that even the local law enforcement will bow to his wishes.
All of this is set against the backdrop of the players being adolescents in high school, with many of the coming of age problems common to teens. There are some disturbing scenes of very heavy drinking at a strip club where the players are shocked to see someone they know up on stage, giving new meaning to the term moon(light)ing.
Much of the action is predictable, specifically the way the big-game-at-the-end concludes. One of the most interesting and unusual characters is the younger brother (Kyle) of the second-string quarterback that is forced into a starring role when the starter is injured. Kyle is heavily into traditional religion, providing a curious backdrop to the many adults that consider high school football to be their religion.
While this is ultimately a teen movie, adults will relate to the problems these characters have in trying to meet the unreasonable expectations of the adults. The conclusion is one that will satisfy all viewers, as the game and girl are both won at the end.",Varsity Blues
48,Svenstadt,This is what real teenagers deal with.,7,9 March 2019,"I really liked this movie because it could have been me in high school. I recognized and empathized with many of the characters in this. At times it seems inane, but that is sort of real for teenagers to do.
James Van Der Beek goes a little far with the character, who is a sheepish, pouty rebel. His acting and accent could have used some work too. His character is practically a port of his Dawson's Creek character. That is the biggest criticism: the characters seem a little too simplistic, and the resolutions to their problems seems scripted and forced at times.
There is quite a bit of sexuality, which is very titilating.
Unlike a Brett Easton Ellis based movie, there is more realism in this.",Varsity Blues

I'm from South Florida and currently live in Southern Alabama as good as their programs are, they don't hold a candle to Texas football. I was lucky to play one year of J.V. football where I kept the bench nice and warm for the starters until in order to prevent the opponent from taking things out against the varsity team the next evening. The night of the homecoming bonfire there were more people at the J.V. game than at the event. Our opponent the Barbers Hill Eagles had already won the Varsity and Middle School Championship for the District and our game would cap off the hat trick. Going into the game we were confident of a victory because earlier in the year as a filler game
we played and had easily won. No such luck. Suddenly the opponent suddenly gained twenty pounds of muscle and it was different. Thankfully due to two missed two point conversions and with a little over three minutes to go our star running ripped of a ninety three yard touchdown run to win the game. The Eagles coaches were so angry they made the team run back to the locker room ( they were bused in). Enough of memory lane.Bud Kilmer legendary coach runs his team with an iron fist. Nothing will get in his way in order to win a district title. When his All-State quarterback suffers a career ending injury (in which he claims the extent was 'never brought to his attention') it is up to the backup to save the day. Turns out the back up was just as talented maybe even more so than the starter. A small act of rebellion has the coach threatening to sabotage his academic scholarship. It is then learned that the only reason why the team's star running only had three touchdowns were due to the fact he broke for runs over twenty yards. Now given when this movie was made I find it highly unlikely a coach would have that attitude maybe in the seventies or early eighties but no way a coach could last with that attitude. In a final act of defiance to preventing the ruin of an injured player well watch the movie.One other thing, if Bud Kilmer was such a great coach, why did he only win two state championships?",Varsity Blues
50,kylehodgdon,Better Than You Would Think,7,18 November 2009,"""Varsity Blues"" is much better than you would expect it to be. It is billed terribly as nothing more than MTV's idea of attractive people all acting like stuck-up bimbos and macho jerks. Surprisingly, this is not what you get from this film.Instead you get a great football movie with some very memorable scenes. The shining moment is the halftime showdown between the coach and team. That scene is very nicely done and a great climax to everything that led up to it.Jon Voight certainly helps the film as he is magnificent in his role as the coach. The rest of the cast is not too shabby in their respective roles either.I was split as whether to give this a six or a seven, and I did settle on six, because the script is definitely familiar and some of what happens is unrealistic and cheesy. All in all this is a fun movie that tells a good story and does have some genuine emotion. Definitely worth a watch.",Varsity Blues

While dealing with these pressures, his grades and girlfriend(Amy Smart) suffer as he searches for his meaning.Varsity Blues is an original type of high school football movie in the way that shows the struggles that high school football players face and the pressure put on winning. It realistically shows how the majority of coaches treat their players and how little they care of their future. The problem is that it was not realistic with every other part of the movie. For being such a dramatic story, Varsity Blues shows some of the most unrealistic football games ever shown. It shows high school life as being one giant orgy and focuses too much on relationships as if it was Dawson's Creek. It frequently loses sight of what it promised to be. Varisty Blues' humor was as dull and tasteless as something shown on a teen-based T.V. show although it repeatedly tried for a laugh. Varisty Blues took a relatively good plot and turned it around into a teen drama that fails in about every aspect.If you are interested in crappy teen dramas that switches its focus sporadicly throughout the movie, then this your movie. But if you are interested in a dramatic high school football movie that it portrays to be, watch Friday Night Lights instead. The acting is not only unconvincing but is even bad for actors such as James Van Der Beek and Paul Walker. Trust me, that is bad. The climax of the movie starts off wonderful but ends more cheap and stupid than anyone could imagine. It is totally unpredictable but incredibly stupid. Overall, Varsity Blues will leave you disappointed and fails as a whole.I do not recommend this movie.",Varsity Blues
53,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 83,8,1 July 2016,"If you want to witness James Van Der Beek attempt to don a Texan accent for 106 minutes, you may not get another chance. While fun, it has all the signs of a stereotypical late-'90s teen movie. It's cheesy, telegraphed, clichéd, crude--yet meaningful. It follows a successful high school football team coached by Bud Kilmer (Jon Voight)--a man who basically runs the community. The small Texas town has already erected a bronze statue made in his likeness. The guy even controls the police to the point that his players can get away with stealing cop cars. That's how obsessed this community is with their high school football. It's all they have.Mox (Van Der Beek) doesn't see it that way. He's the 2nd string quarterback and has plans to go to Brown University and put the sport behind him. But as soon as he's forced into the starting role, he enjoys soaking up all the attention.Varsity Blues doesn't take too many risks--if any--but it has a lot to say. The script is deceptively good. It may be platitudinous in its dialogue and outcomes, but under the surface it makes some seldom-touched upon points.The football scenes are some of the more realistic we've seen in movies up to this point, and it organically showcases the importance of football in some small towns in this country. It then proceeds to question that very importance, along with the aggrandizing of athletics in our schools altogether.Subtly juxtaposing these ideals, we see Mox's little brother, who has an obsession with religions and practices a variety of them throughout the movie, much to his parent's disapproval.It isn't perfect, but Varsity Blues holds up well. Voight gives us a compelling villain to despise and the film more nuanced that meets the eye. It made me nostalgic and I was entertained.Twizard Rating: 83",Varsity Blues

55,MadReviewer,"Fairly entertaining, despite all the cliches",6,16 April 2001,"Like a number of other reviewers, I though ""Varsity Blues"" wouldn't amount to much more than ""Dawson Plays Football"", MTV-style. Well, it's not -- it's actually quite good.  It deals fairly realistically with the trials and tribulations of Dawson . . . sorry, Mox (James Van Der Beek), the backup quarterback more interested in ""Catcher in the Rye"" than in his own playbook, who is forced to become the starter for his team.  The movie's filled with cliches:  the town obsessed with the football team; the overweight, goofy lineman; the slutty cheerleader with the heart of gold; the arrogant coach; the teacher straight out of an early 80's Van Halen video; etc, etc.  Surprisingly, there's enough twisted and wrinkles thrown into these cliches to make the story seem pretty fresh, if not entirely original.  You know how the story's going to end, but you're not always sure how it's going to get there, and that's what keeps it interesting.Van Der Beek is very good, much better that I ever thought I'd give him credit for.  Also good:  Paul Walker as the original starting quarterback, and Amy Smart as Van Der Beek's smart girlfriend.  They played real characters as opposed to stereotypes, and I thought their performances really made the movie.  Surprisingly, I thought the weakest link was Jon Voight as the head coach.  He was a cardboard villain, no substance to him whatsoever.  I kept waiting for the film to explain why he wanted to win so bad, why he'd push his kids with such inhuman cruelty . . . and besides ""because he wants to win"", an answer was never given.  Too bad, although I think this was more the fault of the script than of Mr. Voight.It's certainly not the best movie ever made -- for that matter, it's not even the best football movie ever made -- but it's still good. It has heart, and most of the performances make this film a cut above most of the ""Teen Films"" that are out there.  A fun rental.B-",Varsity Blues
56,mfnmbvp,'Varsity Blues' (1999),8,17 March 2012,"I really enjoyed the MTV Films era, and it's sad that it didn't last longer than it did, and 'Varsity Blues' feels almost like one of their more special endeavors because it is a far more serious effort than anything they had laid on us before. This definitely isn't 'Beavis And Butt-head Do America' or 'Jackass: The Movie'. The serious approach never really feels like it is taking itself too seriously, there is still obvious satire and blatantly crude gags littered about. 1999 was a long time ago now, and just taking a fast glance around this film we see a whole bunch of recognizable faces nowadays. Jon Voight who we all know from his seemingly endless slew of good performances, Paul Walker of 'The Fast And The Furious' fame, Ali Larter, Amy Smart, Scott Caan. But what about James Van Der Beek? This guy is a decent enough actor, he really gives off the right vibe as the kid who would rather read Vonnegut on the sidelines rather than play football, and I think it's quite shameful that he isn't in more films like this, he was almost generation-defining with his fame garnered from 'Dawson's Creek'. I guess the fact that he pretty much disappeared from the face of the Earth after he made 'The Rules Of Attraction' just helps to ensure the cult-status of films like 'Varsity Blues' in the first place. We have two people working on this project who also worked on 'Good Burger' a few years prior, our director Brian Robbins and Ron Lester who plays one of our more memorable characters here, and it's nice to see them all stepping up the maturity level a little bit. They went from graduating middle school (Nickelodeon) to graduating high school (MTV) in just two years.I remember when this film first appeared in 1999, and I remember it being quite a popular ""teen movie"" at the time, and I'm only slightly disappointed in myself for having not watched it for a good 13 years after it was made. The film doesn't make you dig deep, it can be slightly predictable, but you are sure to walk away from this one feeling good about what you've just seen.Also, every time I see Jon Voight, I can't help but think of Jerry Reed from 'The Waterboy' one year earlier.VARSITY BLUES -----8/10.",Varsity Blues

Van Der Beek tries to shake his Dawson Creek fame off, but he won't manage to do it if he keeps playing similar characters to the one in the series. He is a good actor, but it seems to me that he's wasting his talent in bad movies.

OK, so we know who will win the Big Game, and that the Hero won't sell out to the mean and selfish 23-District-Championships-Coach (Jon Voigt).  The movie is well paced and a pleasant diversion; (many in the audience actually applauded at the climactic scenes in the final moments).What I find most interesting about the fact that this film was produced in association with MTV, is that for a Network ostensibly dedicated to iconoclastic themes and attitudes (i.e., anti-establishment and counter-culture), this movie is remarkably ""old-fashioned"" in the adherence to values espoused by the hero.  After he becomes the starting quarterback, he resists the come-ons of his predecessor's beautiful girlfriend, and he will sacrifice his own scholarship to Brown University (an Ivy League school in Rhode Island for those of you not familiar) rather than let another player be used and potentially physically damaged by the unscrupulous coach.Some of the scenes are reminiscent of other football films: The Longest Yard, All the Right Moves, North Dallas Forty, and so on, but I guess there are no real surprises these days after decades of the same essential stories in Hollywood.

However, it definitely has lots of faults.",5,22 July 2000,"When I first saw this movie, I wasn't really expecting a Oscar caliber movie nor a turkey based on word of mouth. So I wasn't neither surprised nor disappointed with this movie. It centers around Moxem played by James VDB who is pressured to play football by his father. He is constantly harassed by his football coach who is considered a State Legend and decides to rebel against him. This movie has several major flaws. First of all, there are some parts of this movie that had nothing to do with the entire plot. Like the sexual education scene, if they would have cut it out, they might have gotten a PG-13 rating. Also, the scenes with Mox's little brother, I thought were kind of stupid and pointless, too.Second of all, the characters other than Mox were shallow and one dimensional. You have the pretty boy star quarterback, the cheerleader slut, the rowdy beer drinking troublemaker, etc. Also, they never really tie up all the loose ends in this movie. Like what happened with Darcy? Did she break up with Lance or find another quarterback to go with? Or did Mox's dad finally accept the fact that he didn't want to play football? Or what was wrong with Billy Bob? Did he finally seek help? I could go on and on with questions that aren't resolved by the end of the movie. However, the biggest problem with this movie is that you're not sure whether it is a serious movie about an obsessed high school football coach who crosses the line or just another stupid and shallow MTV teen movie. I liked the storyline about a legendary coach who will do anything to enhance his reputation and win a state title. Anyone who lives in a small town where high school football is king can definitely identify with this movie. Jon Voight steals the show with a great performance as the ruthless Bud Kilmer who cares more about winning state titles than his players. However, it is the childish and stupid attempts at humor that destroy this movie's credibility. Had they eliminated these scenes, this movie may have actually been more highly regarded.Having said all that, I would still recommend seeing this movie as even with all of it flaws, it was still enjoyable.

Jon Voight played his role perfectly - a perfect example of how you can act with just your facial expressions.Yes, this is a typical high school movie in many ways.

Even in Texas, Football isn't like this. Even for a good 4A team in Texas, the players are far too skilled playing in the games. And I find it hard to believe that the police would 'look the other way' when a bunch of teens are found drinking at a party. But what is really unrealistic is the way the Coach acts. Ignoring injuries, puting players at risk, doing anything to win, being racist etc. It just wouldn't happen now. Maybe In the 50's, 60's, 70's, but not now.
Although these unrealistic, melodramatic moments are all over the place, the movie is still pretty good. Good visuals, some comedic moments, and pretty good acting saves the film. 7/10James ""Black Wolf"" Johnston#76",Varsity Blues
78,BGW Claw,MTV takes a step in the right direction.,7,16 January 1999,"Finally, after crap like Joe's Apartment and Dead Man on Campus, MTV has taken a step in the right direction with Varsity Blues.  Many of the teeny-boppers are just going to see this because of James Van Der Beek, who I must admit it not as annoying as many other teen icons.  There are some really good football scenes, and it is great to see that an excellent and experienced actor like Jon Voight was willing to take the role as coach Kilmer.  A great performance indeed.  This is a pretty good football movie with good insights into some teen issues, in this case, following your own dreams and not the expectations of the majority (parents, coaches).  MTV has often disgraced the word ""film"", but finally, they can remove some of that dirt from their name.  I give it an 86 on the BiggieScale.",Varsity Blues

Crap like Joe's Apartment and the stupid Dead Man on Campus had no appeal to me at all, and only the fact that Jon Voight was in this one did I check out Varsity Blues. As it turned out, MTV has finally taken a step in the right direction. This was a good football movie with several good characters. It was funny at times, and had a good lesson to teach about following your own dreams. Jon Voight was great as always as the obsessed coach, and Van Der Beek performed well in his first movie. He is not as annoying as many of the other teen idols, so I hope that he has a good career, which he should. Go see this movie for fun, for laughs or whatever. I give it an 86.",Varsity Blues

Well guess what? There is plenty of football, beer, and sex. But it's more than that. The football action is the best I've even seen in a movie. Totally crushed Adam Sandler's ""The Waterboy"". The beer is heavy at times, but they don't kill themselves. The sex is miniscule. One character resists. (NO! That can't be! Resisting sex?) ""Varsity Blues"" is full of great fun, action, drama, and good southern accents. (Except for Lance Harbor's dad. YECH.) This one has a good message, instead of play football, drink beer, and have sex. If you see this movie, have an open mind. It's really hilarious if you just listen.

84,Gen S2rt,"A fun movie, with a little of everything.",9,16 January 1999,"""Varsity Blues"" is the type of movie you don't see very often, which is to say it isn't limited to just one genre, but an even balance of comedy and drama. It is the story of a football team, and the players start realizing that most of the people who are near to them only care about them playing football and winning football. The star quarterback is the first to see this when his girlfriend leaves him when he gets injured enough to have to quit. The new quarterback John Moxon (James Van Der Beek) also realizes that even his own parents care more about him winning and being the best player on the team than they care about him as their son. Jon Voight slithers on the screen as (SURPRISE!) the film's 'bad guy', the team's coach, who wants nothing but to win, and to win his way.  Voight was a good choice for the role, because he's already gotten to where you despise him as soon as he's on the screen, which is basically the impression you get with his character, coach Kilmer. Although Kilmer has been coaching for years, this is the first team with someone who cares enough to actually stand up to him.  This type of movie has been done before, but this still does a good job with this type of story. It has the typical girl-kisses-someone-else's-boyfriend-who-suddenly-realizes-his- girlfriend-is-watching scene which has been done so many times in cheezy sit-coms and dramas, but at least it doesn't follow up with a studio audience ooo-ing at it. It leads up to the final confrontation between the team and the coach, where we see how much guts the players have between them to stand up to someone like this, and how far they are willing to go. This film is lots of fun, with some laughs saved up for the right places, instead of just a bunch of random cheap laughs you find splattered everywhere in ""The Waterboy"" (1998), which was only enjoyable if you really wanted to like it to begin with.  ""Varsity Blues"" is definitely a feel-good movie, although you probably shouldn't take the kids.",Varsity Blues

The only violence was on the gridiron  Altho there were some plot discontinuities,in the end every thing  came out in a believable fashion.

I've loved Jon Voight's work in the past and his involvement here is only that much more tragic to me.  He could have spent this time working on a real film.

It starts off quite well with a great performance by John Voight as the stereotypical ""evil and overbearing"" High School coach. James Van Derbeek was good in his post-Dawson's Creek movie debut, he began well with his good guy routine.  His turning point as well as the movie as a whole was when he claimed he'd give up his scholarship to protect his team mate knowing full well that that scholarship was his only ticket out of West Canaan Texas.  The movie ends with a sugar coated ending ala Mighty Ducks 3, where the fat kid who is considered not very skilled wins the game.

Just watching this movie, I could feel the flames of Hell coming up to me.  There are probably ten scenes where there is something illegal or immoral going on with at least one of the characters...which is too bad, because it made an already bad movie even worse!

92,tgjenn,Better Than I'd Expected,9,12 August 2000,"When I had originally seen the previews for this movie, I had figured it would be a funny movie without much depth to it.  After seeing it, however, I have considered this movie to be one of my favorites.As most people well know, the movie displays the pressure of fame and achievement in a small football-oriented town.  The coach is feared and respected by most of the community, including the town sheriff, and insists that everything is done his way alone.  If the kids do everything he says, he pats them on the back and tells them how wonderful they are.  If anyone does anything differently from what he says, he publicly badmouths and threatens them.  Throughout the movie we see the teens begin to see the coach for whom he really is.  And some of the characters who initially don't seem to have much depth --- such as Darcy and Tweeder, in my opinion --- have their serious moments to where one might have more respect for them. Throughout the storyline they learn that they don't necessarily have to follow a single set of rules in order to become successful.However, I do have some criticisms as well.  I felt that a lot of the nudity displayed wasn't necessary.  Plus, the issue of whether Darcy had actually left Lance or whatever she had decided to do was unresolved.  Also, I felt it was a major character flaw that Jules was so set against fame and football throughout most of the movie and then suddenly told Mox to ""step up and play the hero.""  And finally, since Mox's father knew how much of a jerk the coach was, why was he as obsessed with football and winning as the rest of the town was?Having grown up in a highly populated community, I can't judge whether the town displayed in the movie is realistic compared to actual small football towns.  However, a friend of mine in a small Texas town has told me that it is similar to her town...so I'll have to take her word for that.  In any case, what I like best about this movie is how the teens work together and give it their all in order to shine for at least that period of time. Although for obvious reasons I didn't play football in high school, I can remember that same concept in other extracurricular activities I was involved in. I especially like Mox's statement, ""We have the rest of our lives to be mediocre, but we have the opportunity to play like gods for the next half of football.""  Having been out of high school for several years now, I can still think back to the people who stood out in my high school. Of course, I remember those who were popular, but I also remember those who weren't necessarily part of the ""in crowd"" but still made a difference somehow.I would definitely recommend this movie; although the language and nudity might be somewhat offensive, there is a lot more to it than that.",Varsity Blues
93,Jenny-83,"Good general idea, but distracted...",5,20 January 1999,"The central plot and themes of Varsity Blues are extremely meaningful and true to life--if you have to work hard for anything, work hard at it for yourself, not anyone else (or a foul-mouthed football coach played by Jon Voight). However, the movie was extremely unfocused on this central idea with such random plot items as the strip club, Mox's relationship with various girls, etc.And one more thing. Seniors in high school are still taking sex ed? Apparently so according to this movie...overall, a teen flick that could have been more than average but just had to add immature side items to make it ""appealing"" to the immature teen crowd.

98,acidstar,Like every other sports movie. A waste of time.,4,31 December 1999,"I was optimistic when I rented this movie.  I love Dawson's Creek and so I assumed that James Van Der Beek would be good in this one.  However, Varsity Blues was one of the biggest disappointments.  It was your typical sports movie about teenagers who drink and have sex.  I did not like these kind of jocks in high school and I did not like them in the movie.  I respected Moxon and Billy Bob because they were not like the others. 
I was also disappointed with the scene where Billy Bob is shooting at his trophies and Moxon comes to comfort him.  this scene, in my mind, was only added to try and make the movie somewhat serious.  The ending was way cheesy too.  How many times have we seen the hero let the underdog win the championship game?  Too many times I think.  The only really good thing about this movie was Moxon's little brother who was quite funny with all of his religious costumes.  I do not think the actors did bad jobs but I think the plot has been done before.  I also think that it was unrealistic for Jon Voight's character to just quit after the team told him off.  If he was so hardcore on football, he would not have quit and become nice all the sudden. Overall I think MTV needs to stop making these kind of idiotic movies that just glamourize typical jockish-male-dominated-sex-drinking movies. I give it a 3/10. booooo hisssss",Varsity Blues

I grew up in a small southern town where the high school football team was just the be all, end all.  (Altho my high school was not nearly as severe about it as the one in V Blues).  All that aside, I really did enjoy this movie.  I think James Van Der Beek did a really good job as the conflicted young protagonist.  The supporting cast was really good too (although I feel like they should have spent more time developing the supporting characters such as Tweeter, Billy Bob, etc).

It actually deals with some valid and realistic issues that face highschoolers and adolescents no matter what the size of their city and school and stresses principles and convictions as opposed to some elusive image of teen perfection.  It actually shows that the football team is not a group of no-necked idiots.  Who would've thought.. .brains and brawn.

I thought it was good too see James Van Der Beek playing something besides a geeky film fanatic. The only thing that sort of ruined it for me is all the scenes that where in the trailer but weren't in the film. For instance, the brown haired girl and Mox having sex on the hood of his car out in the woods, the part where the girl asks for Lance (Paul Walker) to give her an autograph on her butt, there where some more but I can't think of them.But it was  worth seeing, I just hate it when they have things in the previews  and commercials that aren't in the movie.",Varsity Blues

Of course, I never saw any whipped cream bikinis, but we can all dream.It's high school high jinx on the grid iron in a small Texas town where football players are gods. The stud QB goes down and a recluctant hero finds that sometimes it's good to be the king. But there's an evil high school football coach to deal with, a sexy health ed teacher and a championship game to go through before we find out if the home team wins (but is there any doubt).

James Van Der Beek was smart enough to choose a role that might actually help along his career as a serious actor, unlike all his other Dawson's Creek cast-mates who chose to get their heads chopped off this year.

The movie's exaggeration of these characters and situations is oftentimes very funny, and it works.   The actual plot keeps you interested in what happens to the characters and what happens to the team.  The movie is refreshing as well, in the fact that the injured quarterback does not become the ""bad guy"", and the blonde ""ambitious"" cheerleader becomes a somewhat sympathetic figure. 
As far as the football scenes are concerned, they are done very well, the only nitpicking thing that I could find as a football fan, is that on a long pass play the clock did not stop for a first down.  In high school and college football the clock stops to move the chains, no big deal.And sure, we probably could figure out that the black running back would score a big touchdown, and that they would run the the five receiver set, and that the hook and ladder would come into play at the end, but it wasn't overly obvious like in some sports movies.

And I enjoyed every minute of it.  I am not a Paul Walker fan, but this could be the ""fast and the furious"" of high school football movies.  They would have done better to bring in the cast of ""The Boiler Room""  (Scott Caan is already in the picture) instead of the stars of Dawson's Creek, Buffy, etc.  Picture  Vin Diesel yelling ""We got a whale here!

The rest of the cast was just a notch less two dimensional than other teenage flicks,a good thing; and the stereotypes were lower too(except for Billy Bob, who really reminded me of the fat kid in another football movie, Little Giants). Also, in contrast from other sports movies, at least here the team wasn't the typical ""0.056% last season to champions thanks to our new nerdy/exdrunk frustrated retired player but big hearted coach and that halftime speech"".  Go see it, but don't expect it to crank your karma points up.",Varsity Blues

I'd recommend it.",Varsity Blues
120,Hypnotic31,Take it or leave it...,6,13 January 2000,"Well, the film had its good moments, but overall it was a bit of a downer for me...being not much of a football fan, it was hard to identify with the characters at all, and consequently their conflict seemed pretty distant. Everything seemed a bit contrived, and what few funny bits there were got lost among some of the nonsense...like, for example, the nudity. Very predictable ending, pretty transparent characters, and I could fully do without James Van Der Beek's southern Texas accent. I didn't think it was terrible, but it also isn't going to be making my top 10 list any time soon.",Varsity Blues

122,StevensonCD,Real close to home,10,25 December 2002,"This movie really hit the spot.  I at first only liked it due to the teenage stereotypes, but then other things started to appeal to me. There are some places where parents really live through their kids, and sports are more than fun and games.  And this is quite true.  Jon Voight personified the ""frustrated Jock"" aspect of a coach, and I can say that because I have been coached by one.   On the whole, this was a very well conceived movie with a nice tag line.  I recommend it to anyone who thinks sports is all that matters.  10 out of 10.",Varsity Blues
123,er1cindy,"Varsity Blues is a great movie, all high school students should watch.",10,23 April 2005,When I first watched Varsity Blues I was a junior in high school and I've seen it about 20 times since. The music was the first aspect of the film that stood out to me. Mark Isham is the composer of most of the soundtrack. The same genius behind A River Runs Through It. His mastery of movie soundtacks is clearly evident. The characters in Varsity Blues are all real in the sense that each actor that plays the character is very believable in their part. When I was a senior in high school my friend and I would get drunk and watch this movie before every football game. This film has to be taken as a grain of salt. It is not any Shawshank Redemption or classic American drama but it is by far one of the top 3 best sports films ever made that represents an entire generation. This film is the epitome of high school in the 90's and 2000 beyond.THUNDERSTRUCK 10/10,Varsity Blues
124,MovieTex,"Nice representation, on and off the field",9,18 January 1999,"This movie was a pretty accurate portrayal of high school football and the fever surrounding it. As a recent graduate from the frenzied world of high school football in Texas, I concur with the way it is exemplified in the film. There are a few exceptions, such as how much the players could get away with and how overzealous the parents are; but overall this is a fun, entertaining film. James Van der Beek turns in a convincing performance as ""boy scout"" QB Jon Moxon who is changed a bit by his sudden fame yet ""sees the light"" in the end. Jon Voight also gives an excellent performance as the overbearing coach hell-bent on winning at all costs. The supporting cast does a nice job; standing out as the funniest characters are lovable blob Billy Bob (Ron Lester) and wild man Charlie Tweeder (Scott Caan). This movie is purely for entertainment purposes, as are most films, so if you're looking for a mind stimulating, ""artsy"" type movie then it's not for you. But, if you just want to sit back and enjoy a humorous, adrenaline-pumping, testerone-laden football show I suggest you pay your six bucks and grab a seat.",Varsity Blues
125,gmflash,Greatest Football movie since the Program!!,10,3 January 2000,"WOW!  This film is great!  John Voight reminds me of my High School football coach (except that our team sucked), and his performance was exceptional.

127,Bo Asher,This movie really hits home...,9,17 January 1999,"This was a very well crafted movie, minus the multitude of obscenities. Coming from a small, football-oriented Texas town (ironically, 3-A classification as in the movie), I've seen the ""football above all else"" and ""win at any cost"" ways of life in effect.  This movie, despite the many undeserving reviews it has received, was a very true-to-life account of what winning can do to people.  One thing that I have noticed is that many people, who reviewed it for other shows/newspapers, were not from a ""football"" town as I am.  Anyone who is from such a town will appreciate the way the movie begins to twist towards the end.  I would highly recommend this movie, even if you don't like the thought of the story, just to see the very well choreographed football scenes.",Varsity Blues
128,Sunshine-34,Coolest movie I've seen in a long time!,10,8 April 1999,"I have seen MTV's movies before ( Joe's Apartment, Dead Man On Campus, etc.) and they have never created a movie as good as Varsity Blues.  I knew I was going to like it from the start. James Van Der Beek was excellent in it, as were paul Walker and jon Voight. The ending was especially good. I thought it was very well written and displayed the lives of some football players very well.",Varsity Blues
129,Wrm76,Fantastic Movie,10,3 July 1999,"Varsity Blues is an excellent film. I saw it twice at the theater and watched it 3 times when i rented. It has awesome football scene footage and the acting is fantastic i especially liked Mox, Tweeder and Billy Bob. Mox (James Van Deer Beek) is excellent as the second string quarterback who emerges from the bench to give the team win after win. And Tweeder (Scott Caan) was so funny he was great as the team rebel (he is also actor James Caan's son so you know great acting is in his blood.) And Billy Bob (Ron Lester) who is the over weight slow kinda guy in the film but as usual he is made fum of by the announcers and the coaches. But he is a wonderful person and a fantastic football player as it shows in the film. Although i haven't had the chance play highschool football since i am only 13 but this film really made me think about sports and how no matter how could you are, it can all end with one accident and be over like that. But anyways this is a must see movie for anybody and a must have movie for the jocks or the average guy. It will bring back high school glorie days for some like my dad told me how he had a similar experience on the high school team.",Varsity Blues
130,Dan-317,Better than expected,9,2 July 1999,"In a time where TV's young stars are successfully starting film careers, James Van Der Beek is doing the best in my opinion.Varsity Blues reminds me of high school football.  Which is exactly what it is supposed to do.  The tyrannical coach, the players getting away with anything and having a great time doing it.  Sure they go over the top in the movie but it is done to prove the ""football is life"" in the little town story line. I liked it, as did most of my friends.  This would explain the over 50 million this film grossed.  Can't Hardly Wait and Go were not half as much fun as this movie. James Van Der Beek was very good in this movie and he has my blessings to become the next Anakin in Star Wars Episode 2.",Varsity Blues

This might be what high school is like in a TV show high school, but certainly not in real life. As a sports movie it is very predictable, Will they win the big game? etc.  The plot was lacking, the acting was flat, the accents were kind of funny though. If you want a good high school movie, see ""Superstar"", it was a lot more believable.",Varsity Blues

This movie brings back memories for me, of the transitions I was going through, of first loves, of a lot of things.

135,riccoh68,A terrible indictment on American society,1,12 September 2005,"This is a truly awful teen-flick. I should have been warned by the voice-over during the opening scenes; I hoped things might improve, but the hopes were in vain. The performances are all half-hearted and lack focus, as if none of the actors could be at all bothered in making any kind of effort in this been-there-and-done-that movie. Having never had the 'pleasure' of visiting Texas, I have no idea if a society that is so shallow and frankly stupid could actually exist. All the well-worn clichés are here, along with the pathetic ethos of sexual ethics and substance abuse that will only continue to carry American society further down into the gutter of self-depravity. The context of football is seemingly irrelevant; any kind of activity that attempts to distract such low-life people from the sad reality of their empty lives would suffice. The inter-mixture of patriotism, religion, sport and hero-worship is so confused as to further weaken and destroy any sentiments that may be engendered within the viewer. Although the final scenes are vaguely heart-warming, the trollop that has preceded them only ensure that the viewer really can't give a stuff about any of the characters... In conclusion, really - don't bother.",Varsity Blues

137,Dante25,Not typical football rip-off.,8,17 January 1999,High school football is a popular topic for movies. But Varsity Blues is more than just another All the Right Moves rip off. It is very original and entertaining. But I think that one of the only things that this movie has to its benefit is excellent writing. The acting (aside from Jon Voight) is not really that good.

It displays most of the negative aspects of current americana. It is fueled by dimwitted macho behavior, hitting someone in the nuts while capturing it on video all in the name of a good time is one example. It is homophobic, the word faggot is uttered within the first five minutes of the movie. It has implied racism, big loveable ""fatboy"" has his beloved pig in the cab of the truck while the black guy sits in the bed only to be joined by the pig when the ""hero"" shows up. The plot line has been done so many times before. It adds nothing new. All the characters are flat and dull, even Jon Voight who could have been a highlight, but we never learn why he is such a bastard. Maybe it's just me, but I don't get the appeal of van der beek, so trying to cheer for him was impossible. I didn't care about any of the characters or was interested in what would happen to the ""hero"". crap crap crap crap crap This movie, along with Patch Adams, are two of the most unappealing movies I've seen in a while.

Perhaps with a score or soundtrack the movie would have flowed better and kept me excited and interested in the story.              James Van Der Beek was okay but lacked continuity in his character, there were moments where it felt like I was watching Dawson Leery in New Cannan, TX.  Strange.  Supporting cast was excellent however, Scott Caan and Ron Lester were superb, and I felt that they provided some of the best moments in the movie.

I managed to get this, somewhat, but what I wasn't expecting, was the amount of football to be shown in this film. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just goes to show the marketing strategy of MTV. Overall, a quality film, worth a shot.

The highlight of the movie for me was Scott Caan's performance, I think I went to HS with Tweeder.  You'll want to cheer them on in the end, and that says a lot.

Through its simple writing, you know every character by the first words they speak. And the characters all all so simple: Good, bad, black, angry, happy, confused and evil. But of course, a few words from dawson, i mean moxon, and they see their faults. The purely evil coach just walks away after dawson gets mad in the locker room. the slut breaks down at the mention of the word love and says she just wants to get out of the town. And even the extras suck. Nowhere do kids treat other kids like celebrities. They leave that to the adults and junior high kids. I thought it was so bad it was funny, but friends of mine disagreed. And the sad part was that a good 90 percent of the viewing audience was there to see a good movie that spoke to them in their teenage angst.

But it seemed the kind of mindless comedy that I might enjoy. Hardly.  It was funny, but only because the concepts rang all too true.  The movie follows the end of the football career of Jon Moxon, or Mox.  The scariest part about the film is that it is honest, high school sports, regardless of what, are typically placed too high on a pedestal and the concept of winning is all that matters.  This is clearly the case in West Canaan, Texas, the setting for the film.  I walked out of the theater shuddering, as the events in Mox's life resounded with some of those from my own.  I would emphatically recommend this movie to anyone who does, or recently finished playing competitive sports in school.  My hat goes off to MTV and director Brian Robbins for a job well done.  Who knows, after seeing the performance of Van Der Beek, maybe I'll start watching Dawson's Creek. Maybe.",Varsity Blues

After about the first 10 minutes of viewing, my opinion quickly changed. Varsity Blues caters toward a high-school audience and is a great film to watch with friends.  Females would enjoy watching Varsity Blues because it's packed with extremely hot, sweaty guys.  The small love story also makes it enjoyable for girls.  Males would enjoy VB for one main reason: football. The show is about 75% pure football.  And boobs.  There's a coupla boobs here and there. :)   Varsity Blues uncovers the true goal of team sports.

Robbins does a tremendous job with the directing (enough so that I forgive him for Good Burger). James Van Der Beek is without a doubt a leading man to watch in the future. The plot, although predictable at times, really kept your interest sparked until the very end. The only problem I had was the villain and hero were too black and white. Next time, add a little gray in there. Give the villian (Coach Kilmer) some good qualities while at the same time give the hero (James van Der Beek) a little bit of a dark side.",Varsity Blues
150,hacksaw-2,The feel good testosterone movie of the year... so far.,9,30 January 1999,"A simple run-down of Varsity Blues:The movie starts out with how Mox and his friends grew up in a football crazed town. The rest of the movie details how Mox tries to break free of all the craze and go to Brown University... doing all sorts of things along the way.Now... for the reality check... There are many who say that this is highly exaggerated, that this sort of thing doesn't happen anywhere in Texas... and that they know for a fact because they live there. Well, I am terribly sorry they feel that way, but if they do, they obviously don't live in a small Texas town like I do. Football is a tradition, football is life. You just can't get a date if you aren't on the almighty first-string... and if you play tennis... you can forget a date, PERIOD. This is no exaggeration, it's a documentary of life in my home-town. (However I don't think any of my teachers are strippers... and if they were it'd be the ugliest prune I have ever seen dance.) But, I do recommend going to see it, it's entertaining, inspiring, has nudity and cussing... an all around fun kind of movie. (Oh, and all the hoop-lah about the whipped-cream bikini... it's NOTHING, it doesn't even get smudged! But of course... she looks REALLY good.) The good part is at the strip joint!

What I got was a boring and predictable movie. As many people say, the football scenes were good, but I could just watch that on my t.v. so the scenes really were not worth the money I spent to go watch the movie. From the beginning of the movie it was obvious that James VDB was gonna become popular and then the coach Bud was going down. Obviously James was not gonna succumb to his own vanity and be ""different"" from the other jocks. The movie was predictable and ended up as a waste of both my money and time. The theme was dragged out too loooooonnnnnggggg and cliched. Why couldn't MTV put a new INTELLIGENT or FUNNY twist to the whole damn boring movie? I can understand why some guys might like this movie, but instead of wasting money to watch such short scenes of sex, go rent a prono that might actually have more substance than this film flop.",Varsity Blues

The sad thing is that it could have been a great movie. The football scenes were pretty authentic. But why did the coach have to be a jerk? And where were the three or four assistant coaches? Football is king in small town America. There is nothing wrong with cheerleaders screwing quarterbacks. But this movie really, really stunk. I am glad that I only paid $3.75 to see this movie.

Luckily, I have one friend whom I tend to see such films with (we were a bit disappointed By Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion, and we didn't really expect much), and timing worked out perfectly. So I didn't have to feel like a complete loser for wanting to see it. Turns out, I shouldn't have anyway.I don't think the film had been on more than 20 minutes when we realized that the ad campaign (clearly targeting the teen demographic) didn't even begin to do the film justice.  Instead of a standard-fare, high-school-angst-with-football foray into gratuitous rebellion and the like, it turned out to be a very moving, intelligent, and well-conceived look at how far off-base our priorities can slip when the destination becomes more important than the journey.  With the exception of the last few minutes (which were fairly standard sports-movie material, but not actually *bad*), Varsity Blues was nothing short of astonishing.  We gave it an A- overall, with the minus due to the un-inspired, but necessary, ending.  Well done, all around.  I just wish they'd hyped it for all that it was, not all that it was expected to be.  Those going primarily to see James Van Der Beek would have gone anyway, and I'm afraid it lost out on a large slice of audience that would have truly appreciated it...",Varsity Blues

And not only that, but the acting was great, the characters were great (who can't love Billy Bob?), and the plot was great.  I'm not a big football fan but I just love this movie.  And it's not just a movie about the football team against another team.  It's about the team against their coach (who is a hypocritic blackmailer) and themselves, trying to figure out what is right from wrong and what they are going to do for the rest of their lives.  Kudos to everyone who worked on the film!!",Varsity Blues
157,seidy,I smelled School Spirit,9,11 August 1999,Varsity Blues was a definite boost for those who lack school spirit. I like the color blue and James Van Der Beek never looked better. It was a fairly good movie. Jon Voight was very compelling and convincing as the coach. He was so real.,Varsity Blues
158,El Lobo,What a waste of time...,3,23 April 2000,"This film, in my opinion, seems as if a bunch of executives at Viacom (parent company of MTV) were sitting around in a meeting one day and said... ""I got it... we'll make a movie about high school football.  Throw teen heart throb James Van Der Beek in there, put the MTV logo on it and we've got a cash cow!""  This movie was terrible.  I watched this for free on TV, and still think I should have gotten a refund.  I rated this movie a 3 out of 10.  And it's lucky it even got that much.  First, let me point out it's good qualities, before I tear into it.It got one point just because of the fact that whole movie is about a town in Texas where the entire community bases its existence on high school football.  I related to this because in my hometown, or at least in my school district, it's the same thing.  It's not as extreme as it was in ""Varsity Blues"" but it is just as pathetic.  I laughed because of the fact that some of the characters are carbon copies of the community from my alma mater.It got another point for Jon Voight.  Voight's character may be a little far-fetched (the evil football coach who is hell bent on winning regardless the safety and welfare of his players), but was played to a ""T"" by the veteran actor.  In the entire movie, he was the best actor, and it was a pleasure seeing him perform.And the third point is the cinematography.  Granted, the actual movie itself isn't all that visually stimulating, but the football scenes... were tremendous.  Out of all the football movies ever made, the scenes for this movie were expertly well done with some excellent choreography, lighting, and photography.Other than that... this film SUCKED.  It is full of so many flaws that it's hard to narrow it down for the purposes of this critique.First, the casting.  With the exception of the phenomenal job down by Voight, the acting in this movie is laughable.  Van Der Beek falls in and out of his Texas accent so frequently, it makes Keanu Reeves' southern accent in ""The Devils Advocate"" sound authentic... ok... well, maybe it's not THAT bad, but bad nonetheless.  The casting for this movie (again, with the exception of Voight) was badly done.  Van Der Beek as a star quarterback?  Give me a break.  He's way too much of a pretty boy to seem like he ever even put on shoulder pads.  There were also some points in the script, where you know the scriptwriter wanted a point to be made, but Van Der Beek's lackluster performance didn't drive the point home.  The rest of the cast was adequate, but nothing spectacular.  The character Billy Bob, I must say though, was well cast... because he was a disgusting pig which I never want to lay eyes on again unless he sheds a couple of tons.The script, too, was horrendous.  First of all, the characters were all one-dimensional.  The quarterback who gets all the glory but is still of noble heart.  The slut cheerleader who's not as happy as she lets everyone beleive.  The low self-esteem fat kid.  The football-obsessed father who wants his son to have what he never could.  I could see right through all theses charcters.Another problem with the script was that it was full of holes.  First Moxon (Van Der Beek) doesn't like football because he's pressured into it by his father, than he loves it when he becomes a star, than he hates it, than he loves it... etc, etc.  There's one point where Moxon is trying to cheer up the depressed Billy Bob by telling him to quit the foot ball team... than... NOT TWO MINUTES LATER, he says (and I'm paraphrasing) ""Come on, Billy Bob... we need you.""  Jeeze!  Make up your mind!  This is just one of the many plot holes in the movie, but to discuss any more might cause me to reveal some spoilers.  (although this movie does a pretty good job of spoiling itself)And the kid who's always changing religions, this was supposed to be a running gag, but somehow I found myself not smiling.  Not because I'm offended mind you, but it just wasn't funny.Regardless, this movie, from what I'm told, did pretty well with all the teeny boppers, which isn't surprising.  Again, the actual football scenes in this movie are the best I've ever seen.  If you take every scene that doesn't take place on a football field and throw it away, this is the best football movie ever made (at least from the ones I've seen.)  But if you're looking for something other than eye candy, than look elsewhere.",Varsity Blues

161,SunnyAngel923,It has a great message,7,7 February 2006,"If you can get through all of the teenage humor, there is a really great message for high school students in this movie. At the end of the movie, James Van der Beek's character gives a great speech about being a teenager and that it is important to remember that. I think that this was similar to the speech that Patrick Dempsey's character gave in ""Can't Buy Me Love"". I use it when teaching my students how important it is to be that, a student, not an adult. If you have never seen it, I recommend that you watch it, just remember, the teenage stuff is not as important as the message it sends out. It is important to be yourself. Enjoy life, it happens too quickly.",Varsity Blues

165,Jarborg,Quite a surprise.,8,14 August 1999,"My girlfriend, being a fan of Dawson's Creek, insisted that we go see this film. I, being a pessimistic whiner, complained that it would no doubt be another dud in the long line of movies with teen-soap stars, trying to bludgeon their way into Hollywood. But boy was I proved wrong. Not only was Varsity Blues an enjoyable film to watch, but it also provided us with a wide range of young actors that could actually act (to some degree).The plot itself was hardly spectacular, yes - it certainly kept you interested - but the best part of this movie was the football scenes which were absolutely great. It's worth mentioning that I am a fan of the sport (NY Giants rule!), but it is by no means a prerequisite for seeing the film; my girlfriend wouldn't know a football if it painted itself purple and danced on her head, singing ""I'm a great big fat football"" and yet she enjoyed this flick immensely (partly due to numerous locker-scenes with scantily-clad teen athletes).So even if you think Dawson is one of the biggest wusses to have walked the face of the earth - go see the film; you'll probably like it.",Varsity Blues

172,xfgirl,wait for video,4,15 January 1999,"first things first: i am a dawson's creek fan. but that bias cannot stop me from noting that i was disappointed with this van der beek vehicle. at times, his accent down-right disappeared y'all. and the plot often lacked originality. for a film that will require a plethora of 14 year old girls in the audience to succeed, the gratuitous female nudity seems out of place. however, the 14 year old girls will likely enjoy that van der beek again is the nice boy; a smart move on behalf of his agents.the film tries to quickly be deep with this recurring sport as a religion theme that doesn't work half as nicely as say, Field of Dreams. it also has just enough time to squeeze in a quick racial issue, and an underdeveloped love-life plotline, to add some dimension. and the music, at times when it should have been making me empathize with the plights of the characters, made me giggle.i actually did get some sincere laughs at certain parts... i liked varsity blues best when it was comedic moreso than dramatic. while the dynamic between the ol' boys on the team was entertaining, the female characters are figurines that could have had so much more depth, and jon voight didn't have to do much more than the atypical coach role we've seen so many times before.  van der beek is intriguing to watch on the big screen, however, and it would be interesting to see him in a more challenging film with a slightly less predictable story arc and no accent required.",Varsity Blues

I don't want to sound like a giddy school girl but I'm just stating a fact.  The movie talked about high school life and defying authority.

There are some current issues such as abuse of pain killers in the locker rooms that are dealt with here that high school and college athletics deal with every day.  Also, the party scenes are also unfiltered, and i liked the way that the movie didn't send a preachy message about drinking beer and raising hell, because i know that was how it was at my high school.  I'm glad that the vision of this movie stayed true to the way things really are in High School today, and ""Varsity Blues"" is a great movie for kids our age.Josh, 20, Chapel Hill, NC",Varsity Blues

183,Kirk-32,Overrated glorification of teenage stupidity,1,3 November 1999,"So aside from the fact that this film was directed by a person who's previous credits include the Nickelodeon TV network, why should we all be so giddy with excitement to watch a bunch of teenagers act with complete disregard for everything? There was one major theme in this film, and if the moviemakers wanted to show that they had something to say to teens, they would have pursued it. That theme, how teenage athletes are pushed to exceed the expectations of their loser parents, is valid and would have showed that teens in the 90's are smart and sophisticated. But this plotline was superficial at best, and instead we were treated to drunken teens driving around naked (remember when drunk driving was bad? I guess not if your a teenager) and their stripper-by-night teachers. All of this is geared to cater to the overactive hormones of the mindless under 18-year- old-males in the audience. The result is a film that glorifies the very behavior it claims to be chastising. If you're a girl who drools over James what's-his-name, then this is your movie, but if you have an ounce of intelligence you'll see right through this ""wish fulfillment"" garbage. Watch a real football game instead.",Varsity Blues
184,mom-20,"Please decide; mindless teenage flick, or thought provoking statement about our obsession with kids sports.",3,26 April 1999,"The general story line of ""Varsity Blues"" was excellent.  The only problem I had was the light hearted way the sickness of the town was portrayed. Scenes of drinking, partying, young men, ran rampant, while the disturbing reality and imitation of the real world were put on the back burner.  In modern day society, sports heroes are paid more than doctors and teachers. This theme was echoed throughout the movie, with the whole town orbiting their lives around a football team.  The only person who seemed to keep his head through the conflict was Moxon, and even he had trouble.  This movie was more about a fathers need to relive his own lost glory days through his son(s), than the facade of a teenage ""us against them"" theme flick.  I would have thoroughly enjoyed this movie if it had chosen what it wanted to be, rather than trying to appeal to almost everyone.  The scene that did me in was while grabbing a coffee in the local cafe, a police officer was discussing the insane behavior of the members of the football team with a local, and the coach interrupts their private conversation and threatens ""do you have a problem with my boys?""  The sheepish ""no sir"" answer made me ill. Here you have a group of teenage boys who steal cars (police cars...that is), drink, hit people in the crotch with a baseball bats, amongst many other things, all in the name of fun, and that's portrayed as O.K. behavior. I liked how this movie mirrored reality, but I didn't like the T&A appeal for young teenage boys.",Varsity Blues

I was wrong.  Varsity Blues is about how we have given over religion in favor of hero worship.  Look at James VDB's little brother, he is ignored and scorned by his own father for having more interest in spirituality than football.  Throughout the movie religious tones are shown, when Billy Bob catches the ball, the martyrdom of various characters, etc. The acting, particularly Ron Lester and Jon Voight, is superb.  I hope to see more of Lester, he made Billy Bob come alive.",Varsity Blues

The relationships between the characters were weak... no one was to be believed or liked... The stereotypes were juvenile... as if this movie was being written for ten-year old children.

I watch this movie for the first time in a decade last night. And as others have mentioned the character building is fantastic. Voight and Vanderbeek are fantastic and Darcy is smokin! That alone is enough reason to watch the movie however the football action has been understated. The slow motion bone crunching hits and the pumping 90s rock soundtrack make this football action a level above. All in all the great football movie and my only criticism is the major overuse of F bombs. I think a few were necessary but it's almost every other word.,Varsity Blues

An role of Bud kilmar is not far off of what does happen with football teams in Texas. Were the coach is king and it also show how nuts some can get with this game like in the longest yard or Friday night lights a true football story. anyways the acting was good but the sound track was probably one of the best things i like and how they placed them so well with the football scenes and the movies its self. Its funny and it makes me think of my high school and the time i have spent here like the way mox starts it out with those scenes in the start and the end. i gave this a 8 out 10 its a good movie but like i said the sound track really amp this movie up.",Varsity Blues

The scene where AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"" is being played will go down as my favorite cinematic scene ever. The acting in this film should be appreciated greatly also.

Being primarily a sports movie, it has the big final game, but with a wicked twist: you are conflicted about wanting them to win or lose. Either way, the story fails.The whole movie plays out like a 13-year-old boys fantasy. There isn't anyone in the film that a respectable person would want to emulate.

PLus we feel pressure from other athletes to do better than the star-athlete on the team. WE can sometimes handle it, then the star-athlete gets hurt, and your thrown into all the pressure that they had. The pressure from the county to win everything. Than you have your siblings to look out for, what if my little sister has this coach or what if my brother grows up with the name of such and such's little brother, then he will hate me for ever.
