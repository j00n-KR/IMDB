0,bkoganbing,Just a few extra bucks,7,11 January 2019,"The 88 year old Clint Eastwood who apparently has enough wits about him to
keep a driver's license decides at the suggestion of a guest at his daughter's
wedding to do some driving for friends who will pay him well, very well. It's only
after a few trips that retired horticulturalist Eastwood realizes its drugs he's
hauling and he's making too much money now to quit. In fact he's pulled himself
out of some serious debt and bequeathing gifts all around.Being the devil's advocate you got to say that drug dealers are ingenious in
terms of finding new methods of smuggling. Who would expect a super senior citizen who is a few years would probably have his license lifted to be
a drug mule. I say that because two of my uncles at Eastwood's age had their
driver's licenses lifted by the State of New York. But while they were still
driving no drug cop or any other kind would have given him a second look.Which what happens to DEA agent Bradley Cooper and other law enforcement
when they come across Eastwood. But the wiretaps that the DEA has gives
them chatter about someone who is becoming legendary for the weight he
is delivering.The Mule is a bittersweet picture about old age and Clint Eastwood drew a lot
from his own life and others to give us this portrayal. I should also single out
Dianne Wiest who plays his estranged ex-wife and mother of his daughter who
loves him, but can't stand his irresponsible ways.What I love about this film is that we leave Eastwood doing exactly what he was doing as the film opened only in a different location. And he has a degree
of security he never had before.Watch the film to see what I'm talking about. God willing Clint may be acting
and directing himself in his 90s.",The Mule
1,Leofwine_draca,Something different,7,25 December 2019,"THE MULE is another directorial effort from Clint Eastwood, who comes out of retirement in a perfect bit of self-casting as the lead role. This is a true story about an average aged pensioner, happily involved in horticulture, who unbelievably becomes a major drug mule for a Mexican cartel. It's quirky and entertaining stuff, shot through with heart and sentiment thanks to the realistic and well-developed lead characters. Eastwood is having a ball in the lead role and offers something we haven't seen from him before: parrot-voiced, curmudgeonly and stubborn, but with a real innocence too. This makes a good companion piece with Redford's THE OLD MAN & THE GUN but has the edge on that one.",The Mule
2,SnoopyStyle,old man humor,5,14 September 2019,"Korean War vet Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is an award winning flower grower. Times are tough and he loses his business to internet competition. His constant travels have alienated his ex-wife (Dianne Wiest) and daughter. His granddaughter (Taissa Farmiga) is getting married. He needs money to contribute to the wedding and a wedding guest has a suggestion. He becomes a mule for the drug cartel. Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is new to the DEA and he's tracking the mules.First off, the cartel is overpaying for transportation. He's only moving the drugs within the States. The only reason to pay that much is to deliver the drugs across the border. I'm not sure why Clint is not doing that for this movie. It probably costs more to construct a border crossing and it may be difficult to film there now even for the GOP giant. There's not enough tension and crossing the border has the ability to inject vast amounts of intensity. This is generally a well constructed and functionally structured movie. Clint can do this in his sleep. The problem is that he thinks certain scene are hilarious but it's old-man hilarity. It's hilarious to old men who yell at kids to get off their lawns. The negro scene is hilarious. The five minutes of danger is hilarious. Jimmy Stewart is a great bit. The internet is a catch-all. It's old man humor done in an accusatory way. Relax old man, I've changed my tires before and I've even changed an air filter or two. He is directing the humor at the audience rather than with the audience. Of course, Clint has to be a sex machine and I actually find this somewhat funny. Finally, the DEA agents are not seen in the best light either. If they know that it's a black truck, one would think that a drug sniffing dog would be discreetly deployed around every dark colored truck at that motel. Quite frankly, the earlier dog scene is really good. There is a lackadaisical feel to the writing. This is not Clint's best work.",The Mule
3,Prismark10,The Mule,5,17 November 2019,"Clint Eastwood directs and stars for the first time since the movie, The Trouble With The Curve.Eastwood plays a Korean war veteran and horticulturalist Earl Stone. Estranged from his family, his business heading for bankruptcy and in his 80s. Stone goes for a late career change and becomes a unlikely drug mule for the Mexican cartel.A former long distance driver, Stone never got a parking or speeding ticket. He is just the guy who is under the radar that the cartel boss wants. He goes about his work in a lackadaisical manner but is successful until there is a change of bosses.Meanwhile Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is a new DEA agent who has found a valuable informer.Eastwood has directed an easy going old timer film, mainly played for laughs. The script is based on a true news story but it has had to be stretched and fictionalised.All the DEA personnel played by Pena, Cooper and Fishburne are bland. There is very little drama despite all the nasty Mexicans Eastwood has in this film. It sometimes looks like propaganda for Trump's wall.",The Mule
4,claudio_carvalho,Based on a The New York Times Article,7,1 April 2019,"In the 80´s, in Peoria, Illinois, the Korean War veteran Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a ninety year-old horticulturist that has always prioritized his work and friends over his family. He is estranged by his ex-wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) and his daughter Iris (Alison Eastwood). When his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga) is celebrating her engagement with her fiancé, Earl is completely broken and accepts to become a mule above any suspicion for the Mexican cartel transporting drugs from Illinois to Chicago and other places under the alias Tata. He makes money and resolves many financial issues of his family and friends. Meanwhile the efficient DEA Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is in charge of investigating the notorious cartel and the mysterious Tata with his partner Agent Treviño (Michael Peña).""The Mule"" is a drama directed and produced by Clint Eastwood based on a The New York Times article. The story of a 90 year-old veteran of war transporting drugs for the Mexican cartel has Clint Eastwood in the lead role and supported by great names in the cast and is attractive.

He takes a job as a drug mule in order to make up for lost time, most likely driving the I-80 run from Des Moines to Chicago.

6,kosmasp,Under the radar,9,9 October 2020,"Clint Eastwood still got it. He may have talked to an empty chair a couple of years ago, but that does not mean he can't act. Actually thinking about it, it may have been preperation for this role. Because this old man he's playing here, he is not always fully aware of what he's doing. But even when he is, he is a codex. Which I guess does sound like Clint himself.Many faces that I've seen before, many great actors, even in the smallest roles. The title is a bit of a giveaway of what the movie will be about, but what about the circumstances, what about the people involved? There is a microcosmos here that gets explored. Which will leave certain things unanswered, but that is how life is, even if it may be frustrating to watch in movies ... like this one. Very well made and entertaining and thrilling at the same time! Tension filled if you let it ... good watch",The Mule
7,classicsoncall,"""I've never been a Plan B type of guy.""",8,15 December 2018,"Hard to say whether Clint Eastwood is better as an actor or director. The ones he made behind the camera, especially in the last couple of decades are among the best American cinema have to offer. Whether ""The Mule"" will be held in the same regard, only time will tell. At eighty eight years of age, the man has an extraordinary ability to tell an effective story and portray real life characters. There will be those who compare this movie to ""Gran Torino"" but in my estimation that probably misses the mark. In that one, his character Walt Kowalski was an avowed racist living in a disintegrating neighborhood, but in distinguishing between right and wrong, wound up destroying racial stereotypes. Here, he's more like Frankie Dunn of ""Million Dollar Baby"", disengaged from his immediate family with whom he has trouble connecting, but willing to make the effort when events force his hand.I didn't really warm up to the pace of this movie. There was a bit too much of the back and forth road work instrumental to the story. Earl Stone's (Eastwood) situation never seemed as dire as one would expect given some of the circumstances involved with the drug lords and cartel members. When he's finally caught by DEA agents, it's somewhat anti-climactic, with no emotion registered by the man in charge of the investigation. Earlier in the picture, agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) had a moment of reflection with Earl at a roadside café, and that never really came into play when the bust was made.Whether this will be Eastwood's last film or not is debatable at this point. Like a lot of viewers getting up there in age, I've followed the actor from his 'Rawhide' days to the present with great admiration and respect for his body of work. Ernest Borgnine made his last film at the age of ninety five, so in that respect, Clint has a way to go if he remains active. Personally I'd like to see it, but it is kind of tough watching the actor portray a character his own age, sometimes in an unfavorable light given certain lighting conditions and camera angles. Even so and no matter what transpires, ""The Mule"" would be a better than fine end to a long and prosperous career.",The Mule
8,lee_eisenberg,Clint Eastwood's still got it,9,10 May 2021,"I had never heard of Leo Sharp before watching ""The Mule"". What a story. Clint Eastwood (who also directed) plays a fictionalized version of Sharp, smuggling drugs for a cartel partly because it enables him to spend the money benevolently. These moral conundrums arise a lot.It was a little weird in some scenes, seeing Eastwood surrounded by women a fraction of his age; probably wishful thinking on his part. Even so, the movie shows how the old man got more and more into the business, resulting in some tense incidents. In addition to Eastwood, there's good support from Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Cooper, Dianne Wiest, Andy Garcia and Taissa Farmiga.",The Mule
9,jboothmillard,The Mule,8,4 February 2019,"I watched the trailer for this film, I knew my Mum would love to see it, she has a crush on leading actor and director Clint Eastwood (Unforgiven, The Bridges of Madison County, Million Dollar Baby, Gran Torino), we call him ""Clint Baby"". It is unknown if this is his last acting role (most thought it would be Gran Torino or Trouble with the Curve), but if it was, it is a suitable swansong, based on a true story. Basically, 90-year-old Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a Korean War veteran, he has become estranged from his family over the years due to his obsession with horticulture and missing important events. He is facing financial ruin and foreclosure, when he is offered a job by a dodgy friend of his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga), the job simply requires him to drive and will pay very well. Earl drives his old pickup truck into a garage, inside are a group of Mexican men, one or two holding guns. They put a duffel bag into the back, telling him not to look inside, they give him a cell phone which they tell him to answer if it rings, he is required to park the truck outside a motel in Illinois, to leave the keys in the glove box, and he will return after some time to have the keys returned, and his money. Being an elderly man, he thinks little of what he is doing, and being desperate for money continues, but he does eventually peak inside a duffel bag, and discovers it is full of crack cocaine, he realises he has become a ""mule"" for a Mexican drug cartel. Earl faces little suspicion due to his age, his race, his spotless criminal history, and his adherence to driving laws, and enjoys driving, he is trusted with increasing amounts of drugs. His pay also increases each journey, and with the money he earns from drug-running he pays for renovations for a local bar, he pays the bank to stop his foreclosure, he pays for his granddaughter's wedding and education, and much more that helps him to reconnect with his family. Meanwhile, Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) has joined a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) task force that is trying to crack down on cartel drug activities in Chicago. Unknown to Earl, they are catching up to him, tracking his movements and slowly closing in as he makes his drop-offs. Earl meanwhile gets to meet the cartel boss, Laton (Andy Garcia), who is receptive and pleasant towards the old man, but tensions arise within the cartel, a power-hungry lieutenant assassinates the boss, and subsequently demands Earl be kept under tighter control. In the middle of a large cocaine shipment, Earl learns his ex-wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) is gravely ill, he postpones the delivery to make peace with his ex-wife before her death. Following the funeral, the cartel threatens his life if he does not carry out their orders when he told, while the DEA have to pick up the trail after losing him during his disappearance from deliveries. Earl and Colin have a chance encounter in a bar, there Earl talks about the trouble he has caused for his family, and he gives Colin some advice about his marriage. As Earl makes his way to the drop-off point, the DEA task force surround him, they arrest him, and Colin recognises him and has some understanding as to his reasons for his drug-running. In court, Earl pleads guilty to all charges and is sent to federal prison, his family are there and show their love as he is taken away, in the prison he returns to horticulture and is at peace with himself and his family. Also starring Laurence Fishburne as the DEA Special Agent in Charge, Michael Peña as DEA Agent Trevino, Alison Eastwood (Clint's daughter) as Iris, Ignacio Serricchio as Julio, Clifton Collins Jr. as Gustavo and Robert LaSardo as Emilio. Eastwood gives a terrific performance as the innocent, if a little politically incorrect, old man who gets himself into a dangerous situation that is almost impossible to get out of, Cooper is good as the cop on his trail, and there is good support from Wiest and Garcia. It is a film with dark subject matter, but the leading character is amiable and often amusing, especially when singing along to classic songs in the car on his journeys, it is a gripping story as you follow both him and the authorities getting closer to finding him, it does have uncomfortable and questionable moments, especially him with much younger naked women, but it is well paced, poignant and will appeal to all generations of Eastwood fans, a highly watchable crime drama. Clint Eastwood was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",The Mule
10,Woodyanders,The old guy who ran dope for money,8,15 September 2021,"Elderly Korean war veteran and horticulturist Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood in fine laid-back form) finds himself in a financial tight spot, so he takes a well-paying job as a mule for a Mexican drug cartel.Director Eastwood brings a surprisingly breezy, yet still sincere tone to the compelling true-life story that milks a good deal of amusing dry humor from the premise while also still making time for poignant moments with Stone expressing regret for putting more importance on work over his family. Nick Schenk's sharp script provides some spot-on incisive social commentary on race: Stone eludes detection from the authorities due to the fact that he's an elderly Caucasian man, Stone's two Mexican handlers elicit derisive stares from the white patrons at a roadside diner and later have a tense run-in with a hostile sheriff, and a Mexican man who gets pulled over by the feds on the (false) suspicion that he's a mule tells said feds he might get killed by them if he's not careful.Eastwood imbues Stone with his trademark lived-in easygoing charm and demonstrates a refreshing more vulnerable side which both ensure that the guy remains likeable despite the fact that he's running dope for a drug cartel. Moreover, there are sturdy supporting contributions from Bradley Cooper as eager narc Agent Colin Bates, Dianne Weist as Stone's sweet, but fed-up ex-wife Mary, Michael Pena as Bates' amiable partner Agent Trevino, Andy Garcia as shrewd drug kingpin Laton, Laurence Fishburne as Bates' stern superior, Clifton Collins Jr. As the ruthless Gustavo, Taissa Farmiga as Stone's perky and supportive granddaughter Ginny, and Allison Eastwood as Stone's estranged daughter Iris. Yves Belanger's lovely picturesque cinematography delivers lots of beautiful shots of winding highways and rural landscapes. A funny and touching little gem.",The Mule
11,paul_haakonsen,"Enjoyable, but somewhat generic...",6,20 June 2019,"First of all I think ""The Mule"" is a bit overrated and harvesting high ratings solely because of it being a movie starring and directed by the legendary Clint Eastwood himself.That being said, this is indeed an enjoyable movie, but it wasn't really outstanding in comparison to many other movies. Sure, it was enjoyable and entertaining, and it is hard not to be swept away because this is Clint Eastwood. But the movie should be reviewed with neutral and untarnished goggles.The storyline in the movie was entertaining, but it just felt a little bit too shallow to me, because you hardly get any sensation of the excitement or the thrills of one would assume there would be when smuggling drugs in that quantity. Well, sure, it did happen when he was stopped by the patrol car, but other than that, then the twelve drug runs just felt shallow and on autopilot. Now, it is the underlaying storyline of an elderly family man's estranged relationship to his ex-wife and children that really should be the center piece of the movie. And it feels more to me that this aspect of the story is what is the focal point of the movie, and the drug running is a secondary filler.""The Mule"" has some really good performances of the likes of Clint Eastwood, Andy Garcia, Dianne Wiest, Taissa Farmiga, Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Cooper, Michael Peña, Daniel Moncada and Noel Gugliemi.The characters in the movie did come off as being a bit shallow as well, especially the main character Earl Stone (played by Clint Eastwood). I felt like the movie could have benefitted so much more from having added more layers of personality to the character.While ""The Mule"" certainly is an entertaining movie, it just failed to stand out as a memorable movie for me, and as such then I am settling on a six out of ten star rating.",The Mule
12,bevo-13678,Wonderful,10,2 April 2020,"Great movie. Drugs, shooting and fighting. The car chases were a bit lame but he is getting on a bit",The Mule
13,CinemaSerf,"If he'd worn a vicar's collar, he could still be doing it now...",7,23 March 2021,"Clint Eastwood takes on the character of ""Earl Stone"", an elderly gent who takes great pride in his award winning flowers but one who is broke; facing the loss of his home and his business. He has to earn some cash, so takes on a job as a delivery driver. He's a Korean War vet, so whilst never quite sure what he is ""delivering"", he knows full well that the less police involvement with his antics, the better. Soon his success snowballs and he gets himself an unwanted minder. As his money worries dwindle, his personal ones start to rear their heads: his ex wife and his granddaughter who have both had occasion to feel abandoned by him. The DEA is also aware that something is amiss, and they've drafted in ""Agent Bates"" (Bradley Cooper) whose team is soon focussing in on the eponymous character and the net is beginning to tighten. It's not the best film made by Eastwood, this - though at 88, maybe any criticism ought to bear in mind that most folks that age have long stopped trying - it's very slow, almost plodding at times and the characterisations don't quite ignite. The pursuing agents and his cartel employers feature all to peripherally to add much impact to what is essentially the star doing what John Wayne did so well in ""True Grit"" (1969) - playing the part of a determined old man, and playing it well.",The Mule
14,zardoz-13,Clint Still Makes Kick-Ass Movies!!!,8,22 January 2019,"Since Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, alias 'El Padrino,' established the Guadalajara Cartel in the 1980s, filmmakers have been obsessed with the notorious Mexican drug cartels. ""Scarface"" (1983) is perhaps the earliest Hollywood gangster film to depict the cartel and its ominous reputation. At most, 70 films have been produced about the cartels since the mid-1990s. The latest entry in the Mexican drug cartel genre is actor/director Clint Eastwood's ""The Mule"" about the legendary 87-year old Leo Sharp, nicknamed 'El Tata,' who smuggled record amounts of cocaine for the infamous Sinaloa Cartel. Unfortunately, after a decade of running drugs from Texas to Michigan, Sharp's luck dried-up, and the DEA finally nabbed him with 200 pounds of coke in his truck. Sharp served a year in prison, before authorities released him because he was dying. Although this isn't the first film about a drug smuggler, ""The Mule"" represents a milestone for Clint Eastwood, who had retired from acting after the baseball scouting drama ""Trouble with the Curve"" (2012) with his son Scott Eastwood. Like all his movies, Eastwood plays a genuine character of distinction. In the World War II espionage opus ""Where Eagles Dare"" (1968), Eastwood wiped out dozens of Hitler's henchmen. In his popular ""Dirty Harry"" thrillers, he wielded the biggest handgun in the world. In 1974's ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" he blasted a safe open with a 20mm cannon. In 1979's ""Escape from Alcatraz,"" Eastwood portrayed Frank Morris, the only convict who escaped from 'the Rock.' In ""Firefox"" (1982), he played a Vietnam veteran with PTSD who hijacked a top-secret Soviet fighter/bomber because he was the top pilot for the job. Clint Eastwood plays characters who loom larger than ordinary mortals. Similarly, when he landed the lead in ""The Mule,"" he cast himself as the world's oldest drug smuggler. Hollywood appeals to the young, the sexy, and the beautiful, because the core demographics range between 2 to 11 years and 25 to 39. Rarely does a movie about an octogenarian attract multitudes. Although it isn't the most white-knuckled, high-octane, adrenaline-laced blockbuster out there, ""The Mule"" provided the 88-year old Eastwood with another role of singular distinction. Thus far, this $50-million Warner Bros. release has earned virtually $100-million dollars. Longtime Eastwood and fellow octogenarian Robert Redford, best known for ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" recently starred in the true-life tale of a bank robber in ""The Old Man and the Gun,"" but Redford's movie faded away without fanfare.""The Mule"" depicts the struggles of a senior citizen whose flower farm has gone belly up, and his decision to transport illegal narcotics for a Mexican drug cartel. Apart from changing the protagonist's name from Leo Sharp to Earl Stone and making him a Korean War rather than a World War II veteran, this leisurely cross-country road trip seen through the eyes of a smuggler sticks to the facts. In an interview, Eastwood said little was known about Sharp. Scenarist Nick Schenk, who wrote Eastwood's best oldster epic ""Grand Torino,"" drew on newspaper writer Sal Dolnick's New York Times article ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year Old Drug Mule."" My chief complaint is the dreary, fictionalized, family background story that fleshes out Earl Stone's sketchy character. His ex-wife abhors him, and his daughter never forgives him for missing her wedding. Meantime, Eastwood and Schenk emphasize Sharp's eminence as a horticulturist who hybridized 180 official daylily varieties. Surprisingly, Clint manages to slough off his tough guy image to convincingly portray the acclaimed flower farmer. Daylilies dominated Leo Sharp's life, and busloads of daylily buffs visited Sharp's flower farm. Incidentally, Sharp's flowers later graced the Rose Garden at the White House during President George H.W. Bush's administration. Sadly, Sharp's flower business withered when he refused to shift from a traditional print catalog to an Internet catalog. During those years when he created hybrid kinds of daylilies, Sharp traveled around the country, attending flower conventions, and often speaking at them.When ""The Mule"" isn't lumbering down the highways from Earl Stone's perspective, the film shifts gears to introduce the DEA and present the agency's efforts to make busts out of its Chicago office. DEA Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper of ""A Star Is Born"") joins the Midwest office, partners up with DEA Agent Trevino (Michael Peña of ""Chips""), and they recruit an unwilling cartel insider, Louis Rocha (Eugene Cordero of ""Kong: Skull Island""), as a snitch. Indeed, they threaten to expose him to the cartel as their informant unless he agrees to cooperate with them. Eventually, with Rocha's information, Bates and Trevino learn about the elderly but invincible smuggler. Although they set their sights on catching Earl, the sly old codger eludes them at every turn. Earl impresses cartel kingpin Laton (Andy García of ""Smokin' Aces"") enough that he invites him to a party at his palatial residence in Mexico. García spends most of his time on-screen shooting skeet. Cartel henchmen grumble to him that Earl refuses to follow cartel timelines and makes too many unscheduled detours. Indeed, Earl behaves like Robin Hood with the ill-gotten gains he gets from smuggling. He saves a local diner from closing, and he stops during one trip to help a stranded African-American family change a flat tire. Word comes down from high-up to stop indulging Earl. A new regime of murderous cartel heavyweights takes over, and they threaten to ice Earl if he doesn't toe the line. Finally, Rocha's snitching the closes the dragnet around Earl, and the inevitable occurs.""The Mule"" comes with a crime-doesn't-pay message. Despite his advanced age, Eastwood still commands our attention, and his scenes at the flower conventions provide comic relief. One of the running jokes is Earl does a great impersonation of actor Jimmy Stewart. Earl Stone encounters several suspenseful situations that will make your skin crawl with dreadful anticipation. Meantime, the star & director never lets the pace slacken for a second in this 116-minute, R-rated biography. Mind you, ""The Mule"" proves that Clint Eastwood hasn't lost his kick.",The Mule
15,grantss,Great movie from Clint Eastwood,8,27 October 2019,"Due to financial problems, an 80-something year old man takes a job as a drug mule, driving shipments between Texas and Illinois for a Mexican cartel. Unbeknownst to him, the DEA are targeting the cartel.Directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, the Mule is a return to Eastwood's purple patch of 2003-2009, a period that included such masterpieces as Million Dollar Baby, Changeling, Flags of our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima. Since then his films have a bit hit-and-miss, with great ones, e.g. Sully, interspersed with weak (Hereafter) and downright terrible (15:17 to Paris) ones.The Mule combines the human drama that made Million Dollar Baby and Changeling brilliant with the crime drama of Mystic River and the everyday-man-in-a-tough-situation of Gran Torino.Interesting, engaging story with some great little sub-plots and interactions. Eastwood demonstrates his deft touch at human drama, though some of the family drama does feel a bit clumsy and overly melodramatic at times.Eastwood the actor does well in the lead role, reprising his role of the cranky Korean War vet in Gran Torino to an extent. Good support from Laurence Fishburne, Bradley Cooper, Michael Pena, Dianne Wiest, Taissa Farmiga and Eastwood's daughter Alison, playing his daughter in the movie.The ending could have been better though.

18,ferguson-6,just know going in,5,5 January 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. When a film is inspired by a true story detailed in a 2014 New York Times article entitled ""The Sinoloa Cartel's 90 Year Old Drug Mule"" written by Sam Dolnick, we should expect a message delivered with a certain amount of tension. Unfortunately, tension is somehow lacking throughout, and the only real message delivered is the same of most every elderly person (even those who aren't drug runners) - they regret not spending more time with family. That's not to say the movie doesn't have its moments (it does), but know going in that the terrific ensemble cast is given little to do in a script painted with such broad strokes that no other message or image ever emerges.Clint Eastwood directs his second movie of the year (THE 15:17 TO PARIS being the other) and stars in his first acting role since TROUBLE WITH THE CURVE in 2012. Here he plays Earl Stone, a popular horticulturalist who admittedly devoted more time and love to his prize-winning daylilies than to his family. A flashback to 2005 shows us Earl in his element at a convention where he is treated as a celebrity, and as a man who would rather buy a round of drinks at the hotel bar than show up to his daughter's wedding and walk her down the aisle. The family has grown weary of and accustomed to his no-shows, and Earl displays little remorse.Pushing forward twelve years, we find Earl's house and farm in foreclosure - and him blaming the internet (just one of many 'good old days' syndrome bits). When his appearance at his granddaughter Ginny's (Taissa Farmiga) engagement party causes turmoil with his ex-wife (Dianne Wiest) and daughter (the aptly named) Lilly (Alison Eastwood), he is approached by one of the attendees who tells him he can make money 'just driving'.Being hard up for cash, Earl takes the job driving his truck and dropping off his unknown cargo. In one of numerous convoluted moments we are supposed to accept, Earl is shocked when he discovers the cargo he's been toting is bags of illegal drugs. Now mind you, this is a Korean War veteran who has spent his life on the road running his own business. The naivety is a bit too much for us to swallow. Comparisons are expected to Eastwood's turn as Walt in GRAN TORINO (2008), but here his being an off-the-cuff racist is seemingly excused by his age and generation ... plus it's meant as comic relief quite often. Earl becomes a trusted mule for the cartel led by a kingpin played by Andy Garcia, and transports record amounts of drugs valued at millions. Still, Earl is a cranky old geezer who does things his own way, whether that's stopping for the world's best pulled pork sandwich or helping a stranded family change a tire. He's also a 90 year old with the libido of a 28 year old gigolo (which given Eastwood's real life track record, may or may not be fiction).While Earl makes his commutes through the picturesque Midwest (including White Sands National Park) singing classic country songs and ballads, the Chicago DEA is busy tracking the cartel. Two partner agents (Bradley Cooper and Michael Pena) report to the Station Chief (Laurence Fishbourne) and are under pressure for drug ""busts"". It's this segment that truly causes the story structure to crumble. Cooper, Pena and Fishbourne are all excellent actors and it's a bit embarrassing to see them with such limited and basic roles. Fishburne especially seems relegated to intricate dialogue such as ""get it done"" and ""do it"". There is also a Waffle House scene shared by Cooper and Eastwood that so unreasonably requires us to suspend all disbelief that it ends up just being an eye-roller.One's expectation for the film should be tempered by the knowledge that Earl's line, ""For what it's worth, I'm sorry for everything"", is really the crux of the film. An elderly drug runner's life regrets and attempts to make amends and re-connect with his family somehow plays like a disjointed soap opera than a real life drama. That said, even at age 88, Mr. Eastwood still has a strong screen presence, and we can't help but find it interesting that both he and Robert Redford (THE OLD MAN AND THE GUN) had roles this year as criminals with a certain appeal.",The Mule
19,bombersflyup,Likable.,6,30 March 2019,"The Mule is a decent film, though significantly lacking in detail, scope and meaningfulness.It starts out rather slow and tiresome, but picks up and becomes humorous once Earl begins to be tailed. It could have been far greater with some better editing, as some of it so unnecessary. The in-house takeover/killing of Garcia's character for example, as it changed nothing and only retracted. Also, the ex-wife scenes (she's annoying) and some of the start as well. I enjoyed the film enough, though Cooper probably could have been in it more. I liked Ignacio Serricchio as Julio in particular.",The Mule

It's cute and fun to see how he shuffles along as an elderly driver of cocaine.After just watching Narcos Mexico this is a welcome change with the comic relief aspect.

21,gradyharp,'The only people who want to live to 100 are 99 year olds',10,17 June 2019,"Octogenarian Clint Eastwood both directs and stars in this winning film that honors not only his cinematic past but also the plight of senior citizens. THE MULE is based on a newspaper account of a 90-year-old drug mule for the Sinaloa Cartel as adapted and written by Sam Dolnick and Nick Schenk. The result - a sparkling, entertaining and insightful movie that deals with not only the ongoing drug smuggling from below the border, but also the meaning of family, of growing older, and the intersection of these elements.Horticulturist Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is 90, broke, alone, and facing foreclosure of his business when he is offered a job that simply requires him to drive. He is amenable to the job but doesn't immediately know that he's actually signed on as a drug courier (aka 'mule') for a Mexican cartel. He is proficient in his task, his cargo increases exponentially, and Earl is assigned a handler (Cesar De León). But he isn't the only one keeping tabs on Earl; the mysterious new drug mule has also hit the radar of hard-charging DEA agents Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) and Treviño (Michael Peña). Earl makes friends with the Mexican boss Laton (Andy Garcia) and encounters the more evil of the cartel crew. But as h makes (and gives away) large sums of money, his past life of minimizing the impact of his family (Diane Wiest, Allison Eastwood, Talissa Farmiga), and his new position makes him long for the return to that family, even as his ex-wife dies. The end? Watch the film to discover the resolution.Beautifully filmed, superb acting by a very well selected cast of actors, and a story that goes far beyond simply another drug cartel venture, THE MULE is excellent on all levels, proving the Clint Eastwood continues to be a major talent in cinema.",The Mule

As an actor and director Clint Eastwood has nothing to prove anymore, he did it all and that in an excellent way. In The Mule, which will probably be his last movie as an actor, he delivers again. His acting is what makes this movie worth watching. The story, based on true events, is probably not as accurate as it really was but as entertainment it's worth a detour. The cinematography is excellent, the acting and the cast are good, the story not perfect but entertaining. Another good movie from Clint Eastwood.",The Mule

25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Mr. Eastwood pulls another interesting, inspired yarn out the fable",7,29 January 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningEarl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a horticulturalist, who has devoted his life to his craft at the expense of his wife and daughters. But now, in the winter of his life, he finds himself alone and understandably at odds with them. To make amends, he breaks his lifelong good character, and begins transporting drugs for a Mexican cartel. Earl comes into some good fortune as a result of this, and is able to provide for his family in a way he never has before. But the determined Agent Bates (Bradley Cooper) is on his trail, and won't give up until he has his man.While it would be quite a stretch to expect the box office to burst open for a film headlined by a near ninety year old man, it is still testament to Clint Eastwood's enduring iconic status in the world of cinema that a new film of his is still guaranteed at least a nationwide release in theatres, and that an ever faithful audience of old and new, old and young filmgoers will still assuredly flock to herald his latest work. Even more so in these politically sensitive times, with Eastwood, an avowed conservative and outspoken Trump supporter, not falling prey to the soft millennial culture he's spoken so disparagingly of.Speaking of political sensitivities, the premise of the film in itself sets the tone for some pretty sobering examination of racial profiling in modern America in a way the plethora of BLM themed films that seem to be popping out all the time these days couldn't manage between them, with the idea that an elderly white man would be the last person anyone would suspect of being a drugs mule. Once again the star and director, Eastwood subtly hints at white America's prejudices and racial tension, in a way liberal Hollywood propaganda would hammer you over the head with, as we witness in one scene Eastwood's Mexican cohorts being eyed suspiciously by all the white people at a road-stop diner, and then having their car door whacked shut by the local sheriff, just because he thinks they look suspicious. It's an inspired, clever idea that works on so many more levels than just to tell a story.Another of Eastwood's works with the legendary Malpaso company, his slow, considered pace is certainly at odds with the modern cinematic world of fast cuts, frenetic editing and slick visuals, and at times it does become a little uneven and overly meandering, but for those (young and old) who hark for some good, old fashioned storytelling, it's Eastwood all over, with less gratuitous and more observant political incorrectness than his previous Gran Torino. ***",The Mule
26,ElMaruecan82,"Eastwood as an ""inoffensive"" guy (in every meaning of the word)...",8,6 August 2021,"Clint Eastwood's ""The Mule"" is a simple, effective and straightforwardly told tale of an old horticulturist who got himself the very unlikely position as a 'mule' which in the Mexican cartels jargon means a drug courier. Any other director, probably a younger one, would've tried to pull a ""Narcos"", providing one or two shootouts and some gripping suspenseful sequences, but as if it was graced by the wisdom of years, this film doesn't care for effects but for people and what counts to them. And I guess that's the secret of most Eastwood's film, we enjoy them to the degree that what counts for its protagonists matters to us as well.And what mattered to Earl Stone (Eastwood in his first auto-starring role since ""Gran Torino"") is a departure from Eastwood's usual masculine incarnations. We meet Earl in 2005 where he missess his daughter's wedding for another celebration: an Horticultural Convention where he showcases his best flower, a pretty bow-tie and his most charming smile to some giggling admirers. However, the Internet that was budding in 2005 spread all over the flower-business forcing him to close his greenhouse 12 years later. Ultimately his job dedication estranged him from his daughter Iris (Allison Eastwood) and his wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) who never forgave him for missing the wedding.Once again, all needed to set up the character is shot in economical style, leaving characters slightly above cliché-level but we trust gardener Eastwood to have assigned them blossoming moments at the right time. Meanwhile, Earl becomes a mule, trusted with bags full of cocaine to deliver to some specific spots in Mexico. This is an old trope of the innocent-looking fellow used to transport a hidden loot not to raise any suspicion but Eastwood, with the help of Nick Schenk's screenplay, never lets it be the narrative core but rather uses it to emphasize a certain dying breed of men, capable with their hands and rather blasé when it comes to the new technology-driven generations.And so over the course of his job, Earl discovers such wonders as the smartphones but can also occasionally teach a lesson or two to Millennials, like a couple of African-American whose man can't fix a flat tyre. Yes, we can relate to this and it's true we often rely on old timers. He uses a racial slur but the family don't misjudge him for that and when he meets a group of female bikers, only Eastwood can give them the ""D"" word without being offensive and even charming... the reason he can get away with it is because Eastwood's characters have a sincerity of their own, one that belongs to a time where men weren't afraid to speak. Earl is a genuine guy and can even be regarded as a continuation of his Walt Kowalski in ""Gran Torino"", also a Korean war veteran (the original 'Mule', Leo Sharp was a WW2 vet).At 88, Eastwood isn't as fit as he used to be and there are some signs of growing frailness that carry a very poignant significance, he knows he owes honesty to his audience and so doesn't inflict us his trademark bad-ass speeches, death glares or menacing grunts (although he's capable of one sexual prowess not every octogenarian would be proud of). Earl is a nice old man who does his job and acts his age: he respects driving laws; doesn't want any troubles, he just needs money to buy a new truck, re-open his greenhouse, renovate his Veteran club and offer a college education to his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farniga). And he's so good at the job that the drug lord played by Andy Garcia, insists that his little halts to his favorite restaurants and peculiar habits should be accepted for they're the guarantee of his incognito skills, causing the fury of his junior partner Julio (Ignacio Sericchio).Of course the plot thickens with the inclusion of two DEA agents played by Bradley Cooper and Michael Pena and under the supervision of Laurence Fishburne and a little change of management within the cartel, but Eastwood uses these plot elements to emphasize the way Earl can get away from cops not one, two but three times while a poor Mexican driver could see a police blunder coming during a simple routine check. Eastwood finds a smooth way to inject a few comments about prejudices but has a way of insisting that Earl's respectability might be a façade but it's one he's earned it and that he's entitled to use to his benefit. That's why cops never suspect him and criminals call him 'Tata' (grandpa), Eastwood reconcile cops and criminals.And just when you thought these two worlds would converge in a spectacular showdown, without spoiling the film, I would say that it never unveil its power until the end when Earl disobeys the strict rules of the cartel and yet for a reason that earns their respect. But when you've seen enough Eastwood movies, you know his characters can do good things or more morally reprehensible ones, but they always do it their own way, sticking to their principles. And what Earl does at the end is an act of humility and selflessness proving that there's always a heart in Eastwood films and it's in the right place.When his lawyer appeals to the mercy of the court, invoking his old age, war service and clean slate, Earl knows he wouldn't be able to live with himself for the remaining years if he didn't take full responsibility. And there's just something so inherently poetic in that bittersweet ending where he's given all the time in the world to take care of flowers, a fair alternative to freedom, such a satisfying and meaningful conclusion.For a career that dates back to half a century, it's astounding that the Eastwood style has remained so intact, never unscathed but always transcended by the passing of years. Time could affect societies and people but not 'Tata' Eastwood.",The Mule
27,MOscarbradley,One of Eastwood's very best films.,10,3 September 2019,"""The Mule"" is Clint Eastwood's 37th feature film as a director and it's a classic. Eastwood was 88 years old when he made it, directing and once again starring, this time playing a 90 year old drugs mule. It's not only one of his very best films, both as a director and as an actor but also one of the best American films of recent years. The cracker script by Nick Schenk is based on a Sam Dolnick New York Times Magazine article about a real 90 year old drugs mule and was, I guess, probably the perfect vehicle for Eastwood, (he's not only roughly the right age but still fit enough to carry it off).Of course, Eastwood is also probably the last of the great classicists working in American cinema with a body of work as fine as any of the great traditional filmmakers of the thirties and forties and he just seems to get better with the passing of time. His performance in ""The Mule"" is superb and he's got a great supporting cast including Bradley Cooper, Michael Pena, Laurence Fishburne, Dianne Wiest, Ignacio Serricchio and Andy Garcia. There's nothing remotely ostentatious about his work here; like all of his best films this is simplicity itself. It's also supremely entertaining and often laugh-oud-loud funny and I urge you to see it.",The Mule
28,ThomasDrufke,Swan Song,7,27 December 2018,"A marketing campaign coming in at the 12th hour and a film that's still been surprisingly hidden by Warner Bros, The Mule could be a fitting end to a storied Hollywood career from Clint Eastwood. In many ways mirroring his life, The Mule gives insight into Eastwood's inner psyche, as he has navigated being an in demand actor for over 60 years whilst having a large family to look after as well. So if you're looking at the film in that way, it's a sharp and poignant apology Eastwood is sending to his family after all these years. It's not a perfect film, but it's tightly directed, at times brilliantly intense, and even emotionally moving. Even if it is a ultimately predictable and unsurprising drama.

30,Cineanalyst,Forgiven,7,30 April 2019,"I have to respect Clint Eastwood's filmmaking. Regardless of what one may make of the ideology of his movies or the man's personal politics, at 88 years old to still be making movies that exceed the quality of the vast majority of those made by people half--even a quarter--his age and with renowned efficiency is astonishing. Even something as lightweight and, frankly, self-indulgent as ""The Mule"" is a solid piece of filmmaking. In lesser hands, the bits of domestic drama involving his character's family and ex-wife would give way to mawkish sentimentality. I especially love the taking of time to focus the camera on Eastwood's feet in the climactic and tension-filled scenes. Even the casting of acclaimed actors (Bradley Cooper, Laurence Fishburne, Michael Peña, Dianne Wiest, Andy Garcia) for relatively and otherwise non-too-interesting supporting or minor roles adds heft where one would otherwise find a void. Moreover, it's just a lot of fun to watch Eastwood in his later years having a blast traveling about, flagrantly violating the law to transport narcotics and even somewhat so to see the octogenarian creepily and outrageously sexually exploiting young women one-fourth his age.Eastwood knows he's being inappropriate or, at the very least, out of step with some of the more-politically-correct attitudes nowadays; he's known that for a long time. As in ""Gran Torino"" (2008), there's also quite a bit of humor involving his character interacting in a multicultural society, as he encounters Dikes on Bikes and is admonished for how he addresses African Americans, among other episodes. Also like ""Gran Torino,"" ""The Mule"" seems to be something of the antithesis of Eastwood's masterpiece, ""Unforgiven"" (1992), including that they are pictures that, in contrast, ask for forgiveness. ""The Mule"" even seems to be so in that it's a reflection of Eastwood's real life: his apology for the treatment of a former lover and a family that he neglected to focus on his own enjoyment and his craft--flowers in the story, which stand-in for his filmmaking in real life. The saving grace preventing this from being a complete egocentric exercise is the casting of his own daughter Alison Eastwood. It's not for me to say, but the suggestion is that, perhaps, he is to be forgiven; as a spectator, however, his craft is simply to be celebrated for still being present--no apology needed.",The Mule

Clint's direction and acting are spot on, as they always are, his character Earl is not shown to be a nice man, early on and I'm not 100% sure I believe the naivety of his character on the initial runs.One of my few problems, was the script didn't real give Bradley Cooper, Lawrence Fishburn, Andy Garcia, Dianne Weist and Michael Pena any dialogue to get their teeth into, and shine. They are all great actors and they all do a great job, put their characters are bland and pretty uninteresting, which is a shame. But this is Eastwood's movie and he shines. If this is his last time in front of the camera, he has gone out on top. And there is a cringeworthy scene where Clint has a threesome with two women, approximately in there 20's. There have been a few scenes of Clint charming younger women this in a lot of Clint's later work.

37,Dr_Coulardeau,You can always fulfill your dream,9,23 June 2019,"This film is well done but it is a rather small film. An old man who has been on the run all this life and has lost everyone in this life of his that way, comes finally to the end of the trail he may call his life, at the end of an illusionary leash of his, because he keeps himself on the leash of believing he is free and has an eternal lease on life, forgetting life is mortal by definition.He becomes a drug mule out of the need for money and the film becomes pathetic. He wants to be a mule that controls its life. Funny, isn't it? And phony, indeed.With the money he recreates what has been lost in time; He buys a new truck. He recuperates his house that had been confiscated under foreclosure by his bank. He reopens the bar and dancing hall of his youth and finances the old boss of this place. He tries also to buy his family back. All that is purely nostalgic. A dream in the shape of a nightmare.But he also does it in order to remain alive and not become an aging vegetable, if not even a potato in a dark cellar pushing and growing a few germs looking for the proper soil to become young again and be reborn.He also looks for fun, the fun of something unexpected, something he hadn't even dreamed of in his youth or in his nighttime solitude.He enters this criminal field of activity in order to end up in prison for the rest of his life, in a protected environment where he would be able to satisfy his real passion: to cultivate flowers and sure enough he finds a piece of land there and he can plant and grow beautiful flowers. And be rest assured that this has been his intention all along, thus escaping his ungrateful family, couldn't I dare to say, his grateless family?And here he merges the prison and his dream, his old fantasy and his reality, his free and free-wheeling recklessness, on one hand, and his final cell of his life, till death parts him from this world, on the other hand.There is maybe a moral in this film, the moral of an old man pondering on what life becomes when death comes close: how can old abandoned people manage to live on beyond 90 with their heads on their two shoulders? This is a question and now, later rather than sooner, we will all come to it and have to answer it with enthusiasm.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",The Mule
38,zkonedog,More Sad Than Bad,2,25 December 2018,"Clint Eastwood has had one of the most decorated careers of any figure in the history of film. He was The Man With No Name and then Dirty Harry. He has made war films, comedies (Every Which Way But Loose), and touching romantic pieces like The Bridges of Madison County. Even in his later years, he directed and starred in such incredible vehicles as Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino. So, when it was announced he was returning to acting (after about a six year absence) and the first dramatic trailer dropped for ""The Mule"", I knew I'd be in the theaters for it. Sadly, for a variety of reasons, ""The Mule"" is one of the worst motion pictures I've seen in quite some time, even with expectations aside.For a basic plot summary, this film tells the story of Earl Stone (Eastwood), a 90-year old horticulturalist who has put work in front of family for nearly all of those years. When he falls on financial hard times, however, he is tipped off towards an ""easy driving gig"" that turns out to be running drugs for a cartel (they love his clean-as-a-whistle driving record, and no one will suspect him to be a drug mule, right?!). Completing run after run for the cartel, Earl accumulates a boatload of cash and uses it to get his home back from foreclosure, repair the local VFW, and pay for his granddaughter's schooling and wedding. When ex-wife Mary (Dianne West) gets sick and DEA agent Bates (Bradley Cooper) is closing in on the cartel, however, Earl must decide what is truly important to him in the end.It would be easy to simply blame Eastwood's curmudgeonly, conservative character trope for the majority of the film's problems, and one could make a fairly decent case in doing so. This is now the third film where he has played basically the same character, but here the jokes or quips land poorly, coming off as out-of-touch or cringe-worthy rather than humorous or good-natured. Clearly, no one is helping him vet his character choices anymore, as Earl is basically Eastwood himself commenting on race, age, sex, cell phones, internet, etc. The ""old man shakes fist at cloud"" meme would very accurately describe his Earl character here.Even that shallow and played-out character type isn't the weakest point of the film by far, though. That ""honor"" falls to one of the worst screenplays I have witnessed in a long, long time. There is no legitimate character development, the dialogue is atrociously bad (to the point of discomfort), and literally nothing happens for vast stretches other than him driving his truck. Considering that the emotional payoff for this entire story rests on the relationships (or lack thereof) he has built with family members, shoe-horning those scenes into about a 15-minute block of time (if that) is almost an unconscionable error.That, to me, is where the sadness truly comes into the picture with a film like ""The Mule"", as it is clear after watching that Eastwood just doesn't have ""it"" anymore when it comes to crafting a solid film, and that is not a fun comment to make. This is a movie that absolutely reeks of entitlement, where Eastwood is given a blank check by Warner Brothers and allowed to do whatever he wants, surrounded by ""yes men"" too cowed by his presence to present the necessary honesty that this was an abomination of a film.Mercifully, I hope ""The Mule"" is the final major work that Eastwood attaches his name to (although an alternative perspective would be that there's nowhere to go but up after this stinker), as he's in that awkward place where he has the power to command an audience but not the skill to make movie magic anymore. As much as I hate to say it, it's time for Clint to ride off into the Hollywood sunset for the final time; better to limp away with some dignity then continue dragging a sparkling reputation through the muck.",The Mule
39,eddie_baggins,Cranky Eastwood makes The Mule worth watching,6,11 February 2019,"You'll learn some odd things from The Mule, Clint Eastwood's return to the big screen at the ripe old age of 88.Some of the lessons and learnings you may take away from this based on a true life story of 90 year-old drug mule Leo Sharp working for a Mexican drug cartel are;*Being a mule for a gun-toting cartel can be a lucrative and relatively hassle free life.*Clint Eastwood sure hates phones but loves woman (especially ones in bikinis).*Clint Eastwood hates the ""darn internet"".*Family is more important than work.*Watching countless scenes of Eastwood sitting in a car and singing the wrong words to songs is a randomly therapeutic feeling.And*Actress Diane Wiest can do the worst impression of someone dying you've ever seen, with the actress honestly downright embarrassing in her turn as Eastwood's Earl Stone's ex-wife Mary.There's more teachings and observations to be found in Eastwood's latest film, a film that the legendary Hollywood figure shot and edited in roughly half a year, continuing on his long lasting legacy of getting things done with very little fuss and bother but like much of his work over the last 10 years, The Mule does feel like a rather haphazard affair, even if it's still an undeniable joy getting to see Eastwood ply his trade in what certainly should be his last acting role.There's a lot wrong with The Mule, most glaringly the fact that it's hard to know what we are supposed to feel for Earl, who's a racist, bigot, self-centred and rather unlikable central figure who we are supposed to feel sorry for because he wishes he was better to his family?It's an odd choice to make Earl such a genuinely cold main protagonist, while the films other problems such as a fair share of trite dialogue, underdeveloped side characters (the likes of Bradley Cooper, Clifton Collins Jr, Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia may as well have not shown up), treatment of its generic Mexican villains (who love a good party and gold guns) and the tension-free plot that literally allots 90 minutes of screen time to Earl just driving around on cross country drug runs and learning how to text, help to combine to make The Mule a so-so outing.Where the film does find itself winning is the care-free nature of Eastwood's acting.There's something odd, charming and even hilarious about the living legends turn here, shuffling around and enjoying the finer things in life like threesomes, dancing, pulled pork sandwiches, helping ""dikes on bikes"" and assisting coloured folk with changing their care tyres, Eastwood's turn as Earl is a sight to behold and in some brief moments within the film, quite touching and the chance to see Eastwood once more on the big screen is an enjoyable occurrence, even if it's unlikely The Mule will ever be thought of much more once time wears on.Final Say -A sometimes atrocious and sometimes oddly brilliant true life yarn that could've done with a few extra months of refinement and polish, The Mule is forgettable Eastwood but also an entertaining excuse to witness the Hollywood icon appear on the big screen for what should be his last acting role.3 pool parties out of 5",The Mule
40,leonblackwood,A Great Watch! 7/10,7,31 January 2020,"Review:
Clint Eastwood's movie's always have a way of drawing the audience into the storyline, and his complex characters and straight forward, but effective directing style, make his films unique and a joy to watch. This film is yet another great achievement by the 89-year-old filmmaker/actor, who puts in a great performance as Earl Stone. Although there are other established actors in the film, it's really Eastwood who brought the intensity and emotion to the screen, and the fact that he also directed and produced the movie, really makes him an extraordinary individual, who gives his all to every project. As I hadn't heard anything about The Mule before I saw it, I was really surprised to see what the concept was actually about, even though I should have worked it out by the title. I was also shocked to hear that it was based on a true story, about a World World II veteran called Leo Sharp, who became a drug courier for the Sinaloa Cartel in his 80's, so Clint Eastwood was the perfect choice for the leading role. Anyway, the film kicks off with Earl Stone in his 80's, who is an award-winning horticulturist and Korean War veteran in Peoria, Illinois. He is facing financial ruin and is estranged from his ex-wife Mary (Dianne Wiest), and his daughter Iris, played by his real-life daughter Alison Eastwood, for always putting work before family. He is still on friendly terms with his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga) and attends her wedding rehearsal. Desperate for money, he takes up an offer from the friend of one of Ginny's bridesmaids and becomes a ""mule"" transporting cocaine through Illinois for a Mexican drug cartel. Facing little suspicion due to his age, race, spotless criminal history, and strict adherence to driving laws, Earl is soon trusted with huge amounts of drugs and is paid large amounts of cash. With the money, he buys a new truck, settles his financial problems, and pays for renovations of the local VFW Post, as well as his granddaughter's wedding and education. He becomes friendly with the cartel members, who call him ""Tata"" (grandfather). Meanwhile, with details from an informant, a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) task force Is narrowing in on the cartel's deliveries to Chicago. Tensions within the cartel erupt when Gustavo (Clifton Collins Jr.), a power-hungry cartel lieutenant, assassinates cartel boss Laton (Andy Garcia) and subsequently demands Earl be kept under tighter control. In the middle of a $12million cocaine shipment, Earl learns that Mary is gravely ill. After Ginny talks some sense into him, he postpones the drug delivery to make peace with Mary and stays by her side until she dies peacefully days later. After the funeral and after finally reconciling with his family, Earl resumes the delivery as both DEA and the cartel close in on him. The cartel's enforcers catch him and, upon discovering he was away to attend his wife's death and funeral (which they respect), call the cartel leader to request leniency. The cartel underboss allows him to continue, with the instructions that if anything went wrong it would be on the enforcer's head. Next, we see Earl driving with a head injury and blood on his face. As he makes his way towards the drop point, almost resignedly as a helicopter is circling overhead, he slows to a halt to allow the DEA agents to arrest him. In court, disregarding his age as an excuse and guilt-ridden over his crimes and for failing his family, Earl pleads guilty to all charges and is sent to federal prison with his family showing him their support. In prison, he returns to horticulture. It's not everyday that you see Clint Eastwood play a baddie, but I kind off understand why he did what he did. I know that he took it a bit far, in a Robin Hood type of way, but I was glad to see him take his punishment like a man. On the downside, there are a few gaps in the storyline and it seems to jump in a few places, but he did have a lot of ground to cover. In all, I was happy with the film, and I was thoroughly entertained, so it gets a thumbs up from me. Great Watch!Round-Up:

41,TheMovieDiorama,The Mule drives in the slow lane and nearly gets a flat tyre.,5,29 January 2019,"This is a major step up from Eastwood's previous directorial efforts with the absurdly boring 'The 15:17 to Paris'. A cast of talented actors, including himself, and a premise that becomes instantly accessible for audiences. But there was something missing. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the back of my mind was screaming at me. And then I realised. I was watching, but not seeing. Nothing in this film was dramatic enough for me to become invested which ultimately left me unsatisfied. Recounting the true story of a war veteran naively becoming a drug courier for a Mexican cartel, whilst DEA agents attempt to track him down.There is poignancy to the character that Eastwood embodies and the story he attempts to direct. Finding resolution with the family that he never went to see, and with himself as a person. Presenting an argument that change is always possible, no matter the circumstance. Sometimes we need to take the wheel and control our own lives. However, due to the light-hearted nature of the narrative, this compelling philosophy never sticks. In fact, there is an obscene lack of dramatic heft that ultimately makes this drama underwhelming. He tries though! Gosh darn Eastwood gives it his best shot. At 88 years of age, the man is defying all odds and still helming his own films. He has this infectious charm and ""old-man"" quality to him that automatically makes us believe in him. And, let's be honest, only Eastwood could portray a casually racist veteran and still make him endearing. The rest of the cast? Forgettable. Their characters were neglected and remained one-dimensional. The DEA investigation was underdeveloped and provided no thrills. The dysfunctional family relationships with Earl weren't powerful enough to convey any emotional impact. Heck, I felt more invested in the cartel members than I did his ex-wife. Without the drama, none of the above sticks. Like I said, watching but not seeing.Schenk's screenplay does play a big role in this film's disappointing end result. Aside from the last third where Earl's words do have meaning, it's just constant mumbling. ""Yup, on the road again. Just on the highway. Just driving. Hey boys! I'm driving. How do I text?"". It's clear that the target demographic is of the older generation who will find many of these lines utterly hilarious, particularly the ""dykes on a bike"" scene. But it's perhaps too light-hearted for the story that Eastwood is trying to convey. There is no grit to his character or his words. Not to mention the plot conveniences that make the script amateurish at best, especially how Earl quickly found himself in the drug couriering industry just because ""I never had any tickets and I've never been pulled over by the cops. No sir!"". It's naively charming, but naive regardless. Much like Eastwood, the whole film just felt tired.It's a pleasant slow watch which I'm sure many will appreciate from the legendary Eastwood. However its repetitious drug runs and absent drama will leave some wanting to pull over and stop, particularly by the ninth run. Oh, and a 90-year old man in a threesome with two women? I had to look away...",The Mule
42,Ed-Shullivan,"Proof once again why Clint Eastwood is ""THE"" Hollywood ICON",8,13 March 2020,"I rate it an 8 out of 10Enjoy any and all new Clint Eastwood films while you still can folks as this Hollywood icon is getting very close to forever hanging up his six guns and sooner rather than later planting not only flowers but himself in the ground. Eastwood was 88 when he self-directed himself in this starring role based on a real life geriatric character who ran drugs for the cartel. This is just one more notch in a stellar film portfolio that Eastwood has amassed over the past 60 plus years as a film maker and biggest Hollywood star EVER!!!!!!I enjoyed Clint as the geriatric gritty and reluctant drug mule to make a little extra cash to help out his family (including his granddaughter who is getting married) and come to the realization that he was not the best father and/or husband the past few decades of his life. Of course this film version of a real life 90 year old drug mule took great liberties with the real story and crimes, and it downplayed the negative impact this heroin would cause all the American families who eventually purchased the drugs and sank their heroin into their arms.The film portrays the 88 year old Eastwood as somewhat of a remorseful father who becomes the most successful drug mule such that the first level gang members look up to him and admire his gusto and the cartel boss (Andy Garcia) invites him to his private Mexican mafia mansion to enjoy all the pleasures this drug money provides including a bevy of beauties for this old man to fool around with. Heck, even the FBI and drug enforcement officers take a liking to the old man and want his advice on life and one's opinion on successes and failures.Thank you Mr. Eastwood for bringing another great story to the silver screen, and please consider making just one more western before finally hanging up your Hollywood Star.. Maybe you could title it ""The Good, the Bad, and the ""VERY BEST"".!!!!!!",The Mule
43,pmtelefon,Top five Clint,10,17 January 2019,"Since there aren't many screenplays that focus on ninety year old men, ""The Mule"" will likely be Clint's last on screen appearance. He doesn't go out playing a hero. He plays a deeply flawed man. That took guts. Clint delivers a great performance. As usual, his supporting cast was also very good. ""The Mule"" is a very suspenseful movie. There are several edge-of-your-seat moments. Two hours never went by so fast. ""The Mule"" is a great addition to Clint Eastwood's Hall of Fame resume.",The Mule

It's not really bad, but it is just lacking punch big time.It's time to respectfully retire when Clint Eastwood starts churning out these kind of movies.The story is based on true events and sounds really interesting. An old man who starts smuggling drugs over the Mexican border, such a story does sparkle the imagination. But however interesting the plot might sound the execution of this story isnt suspsenseful whatsoever. It isnt action packed either. It has some jokes, but even those feel like I have heard them before.Just feels odd seeing Clint shuffle like a senior old man through this movie. There comes a point where it becomes a bit sad to watch an old man still trying to look young and tough. Those days are gone for Clint Eastwood. Fortunately there are still lots of great other Clint Eastwood movies from his younger days, which I will watch again with pleasure and admiration.

45,paul-allaer,Lightweight drug mule drama lacks tension,6,17 December 2018,"""The Mule"" (2018 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Earl. As the movie opens, we are told it is ""Peoria, IL, 2005"", as we see 90 yr. old Earl tend to his garden and flowers. As it happens, he is also being recognized at the local Daylily Convention, but on that very same day, his daughter is furious that he is missing her big day (getting remarried) again. We then go to ""12 Years Later, 2017"", as we learn that Earl's garden and flower shop is going out of business, and in fact he is ruined in every which way, including financially. Out of desperation, Earl reluctantly agrees to become a drug mule for a Mexican cartel. Meanwhile DEA Special Agent Bates starts new position in Chicago, and his boss wants him to make inroads against the drug cartels... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.This is the latest project from producer-director Clint Eastwood (who also stars as Earl). Here he plays a role that he could probably play in his sleep: a cranky, ol' school guy who isn't going to take crap from anyone, and certainly speaks he mind as he sees fit (including some racial slurs). The big question is of course what will become of this old drug mule? Bradley Cooper plays second fiddle as Special Agent Bates. Don't get your hopes up for a lot of shared screen time between these two stars (in fact their first joint scene isn't until an hour and 20 min. into the movie). Much is made in the film about the rift between Earl and his daughter. It wasn't until the end credits rolled that I noticed this role is played by Clint Eastwood's real-life daughter Alison Eastwood! And Eastwood can't help but slip in a dig at cops pulling over drivers. When an innocent man is pulled over, he keeps telling Special Agent Bates ""the most dangerous 5 minutes of my life is getting pulled over by the cops"". Okay, we get it already! It also wasn't until I saw the end credits that I realized this movie is based on real life events (using an article that appeared in the New York Times). Wow! But in the end, this drug mule drama is too lightweight and lacks tension to leave a strong impression. (Compare this, for example, to the first ""Sicario"" movie of a few years ago. Now that's a drug cartel drama!)""The Mule"" opened wide this weekend, and based on the movie's strong trailer, I was eager to see it. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended very strongly (at least 50 people, maybe more), most of them on the older side. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood, or are interested what is at best a footnote in the drug cartel drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Mule
46,jtindahouse,A bit choppy and underdone but still highly watchable,7,18 April 2019,"I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's film-making abilities for the most part, but I am well aware that the fan is far from being a perfectionist. His movies sometimes border on being amateurish at times. They're not, I think this mostly just stems from him seemingly being happy with very few takes of each scene. 'The Mule' was a good film that could have been a great film. With a little more care and effort this could have been something quite special.The film felt very similar to 'Gran Torino' (my favourite Clint Eastwood directed film). That one also had some very sloppily put together scenes, however the character interactions and the films ending drove that to be something quite great and special. 'The Mule' has moments of great character interactions but also has some moments that are more cringe-worthy than anything else.There are also some odd editing choices. At one point the film sets itself with a very interesting scene about to take place, and then just cuts away and never mentions it again. I would love to know what happened there. Did they film the scene and it didn't turn out well, or did they just feel like mentioning that it was about to happen was enough? Either way, it's very sloppy.The fact that Clint Eastwood is still directing and even starring in films at his age is testament to the man. I'm glad that he had bounced back from the rather disastrous venture that was 'The 15:17 to Paris'. 'The Mule' may not be perfect, but it is a far superior film to that one.",The Mule

I, for one, think it's even better that he plays a character who is actually quite unlike any we have really seen from him, ie. not the ageing Dirty Harry we got in ""Gran Torino"". He's more of an everyman.Eastwood also brings in a bunch of great actors who, like him, haven't been in front of the camera in a while, including the two-time Oscar winner Dianne Wiest, Andy Garcia, and Laurence Fishburne.You already know what the movie is about, so I won't recount that here.

50,dfranzen70,He's also the mule because he's stubborn. Get it?,7,22 April 2019,"I thought this was going to be another Clint-plays-a-cantankerous-old-crank film and nothing more, but it's better than that. I mean, he is still irascible, but there's a layer of believability and earthiness to his Earl Stone that makes the character - and the movie - feel sincere and authentic. In The Mule, Eastwood is a horticulturist who cares way, way more about his flowers than he does his family; he misses the wedding of his daughter (played by real-life daughter Alison) and makes it to the rehearsal dinner of his granddaughter's wedding only because his home/business have been foreclosed upon. It's while exiting said dinner (prematurely) that Earl learns of a new business opportunity - just driving. I mean, it's driving for a Mexican cartel, but hey. And Earl's really good at it, because he never gets pulled over, doesn't look suspicious, etc. The money's good, and Eastwood does a fine job wrestling with the morality of the situation, but his character is unaware of two things - that Special Agent Bates (Bradley Cooper) is on his trail and that the cartel itself is undergoing some radical changes that'll surely affect Earl. Dianne Wiest has a strong role as Earl's estranged wife. Taissa Farmiga, Vera's sister, plays his granddaughter. Andy Garcia is the cartel lord. Michael Pena is Bates' partner, and Laurence Fishburne is their boss. The Mule is pretty good, although there's a patch of sentimentality in the middle that feels a little out of step with the film to that point - it kind of stops the movie in its tracks.",The Mule

54,st-shot,The Mule has no kick.,5,18 December 2018,"Clint Eastwood mugs and regrets in old age as a victim of the Internet in The Mule. An old school horticulturalist unable to adjust to the age he is led to desperate measures transporting drugs as he takes a series of rides in pick-ups, attends a variety of parties and annoys a series of mean looking Latinos in garages in this exhausted suspense that remains under the radar nearly all the way.Eastwood is compelling in moments but also understandably sluggish. He does manage to get in some dancing and groping with the ladies becoming annoying eventually as he turns to a series of mawkish scenes to haul this beast of burden home turning this supposed suspense into a sentimental Hallmark family re-union film.A supporting cast of noted actors also seem to suffer from the same anemia. Bradley Cooper looks like he is doing an SNL skit with stagy tough talk. Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia act flat, look terrible. Diane Wiest attempts to dignify the script but drowns in the flood of syrup at the film's conclusion.The Mule simply has no kick with it's only draw a cantankerous Eastwood well into his 80s displaying an impressive physical fitness but also his highly diminished directorial skills last seen in his Letters from Iwo Jima days..",The Mule
55,CubsandCulture,Would be a nice swan song...,8,15 December 2018,"I am not sure if Eastwood is done acting or directing (allegedly he retired from acting 2 films ago) but The Mule would be a fitting final film for him. His Earl is touching character and Eastwood's multilayered compelling performance never falters even if the narrative does. Earl's seems to have little bit over all of Eastwood's mainstay. Something of a cowboy, gruff and ornery but shot through with tender romance, regret Earl seems very real. He is a man who the world has moved on from but perhaps we shouldn't in all ways. If nothing else Earl is a great Eastwood character.Eastwood, as director, continues his stylistic simplification into extreme naturalism. I think a lot of people might find the film flat as a result. There's very little artifice here and the camera schema is simple and straightforward. I think this works ironically for the film; it reminds me very much of Ford and it re-enforces the notion the world has moved on from Earl. In any case the spartan and sparse direction really brings attention to the performances.The screenplay, penned by the Gran Torino screenwriter, is solid. I like how it works in an implicit critique of racial profiling and Left's lack of proportion in response to forms of racism. What I mean is the film makes it clear that being an old white guy allowed Earl to be a good mule because the cops weren't looking for him. Likewise the racial target by police is far graver than Earl using some bigoted terms now and then but the Left sure seems to be more upset at the Earl's of the world.However, there are few scenes and notions that needed to be worked more in the script. Of note, the Michael Pena scene is shockingly badly written. Pena's character is unbelievable and the dialog is way, way, way too on point. The film is severely harmed by it.Nonetheless, this should please Eastwood fans.",The Mule

This is more than a smuggler story, it clearly addresses the need to keep family first and relationships close before time runs out in life. This was a well-told and rather unique story. Eastwood gave another great performance with this memorable story, the cinematography was nothing to write home about.",The Mule

59,jimbo-53-186511,Routine,5,12 February 2020,"When his horticultural business collapses, former Korean War Veteran Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is offered a job which he is told just involves him driving from point A to point B. Having driven across 41 of the 50 states in his lifetime, Earl jumps at the chance of making an easy buck by doing something that he enjoys. However, Earl soon realises that he is working for the Cartel and finds himself involved in something that is easy to get into and nigh on impossible to get out of...In The Mule, Eastwood plays slightly against type by portraying Stone as being a tad naïve whilst also lacking a tough edge. Given the majority of Eastwood's films focus on him playing tough characters this is certainly a moderately interesting change of pace, but sadly there are still a number of problems with this film...Whilst it starts off strong, The Mule struggles to build a compelling central story; the main narrative arc sees Eastwood drug running for the Cartel between Texas and Chicago, but in the main that's all that really happens and when you see this recurring theme on a continuous loop it does start to feel a bit boring. To try to offset some of the boredom, Eastwood portrays Stone with something of a comedic edge which is certainly amusing at times.Away from the main narrative, the film then cuts back to Stone's family where we continually bear witness to Earl's failings as a husband, parent and grandparent. Again, as with the drug running this too feels heavy-handed and repetitive and it only really starts to carry some weight towards the end of the film (some of the scenes towards the end show that Eastwood can do drama even if at times it feels a tad manufactured and manipulative).Then we have Bradley Cooper and Michael Pena as DEA agents who are tracking the Cartel and trying to bring down their operations. This is where the film should have had some urgency, but their investigations add little of any particular consequence or significance (until right at the end naturally by which time my interest had long since faded).Andy Garcia is one of the sole bright spots (he's having fun here and it shows). Eastwood gives another solid turn (despite some problematic direction) and let's face it I bet he had a lot of fun making this film and they'll be no prizes for guessing what the favourite scene of the film for himself would be - if you've watched the film then you'll know. Both veteran actors give confident and assured performances and do give the film some much needed jolts of humour.Overall The Mule is an OK film, but given how good Eastwood can be this is a little disappointing - it all feels a bit routine, run-of-the-mill and workmanlike. There's nothing wrong with Eastwood's performance (he feels like he's playing a very low-key version of Walt Kowalski at times). However, for me the film lacked urgency, excitement and tension and it doesn't help that Stone is a tad selfish as a protagonist - although this does at least get addressed. In typical Eastwood fashion, this is a well-made film, but unlike some of his other films this is not a particularly involving experience.",The Mule

As an actor and then director, he's my adoration and I always watch movies (written &) directed by him with great enthusiasm and awe, and The Mule is no exception.A movie where 2/3 of the time, my stomach was in my mouth, literally jumping up and down my seat, fearing the worst, sweating internally, my heart doing funny things in my chest, adrenaline and cortisol rushing through my blood. The level of stress and expecting the worst were just crazy.(+-) Superb and emotional screenplay, deeply thought out, based on true events, though with some illogical things and fate happening in-between.(+) Amazing, emotional and thrilling acting by Eastwood and all the cast, mainly his family. The cops and related were also good, believably doing their acting job. However, the bad guys were a little mild.(+) Very beautiful filming and shots, whether aerial or close-ups.(+) Lovely score, mixing awesome jazz with a soothing yet saddening effect.It lost steam towards the end with mostly rushed events and closure, IMO. That's my only negative view on it.Very enjoyable overall and heart-warmingly lovely as the man went back to his beautiful flowers in the end, though in a different place.Thank you Mr. Eastwood.

62,Kdosda_Hegen,Ruined by generic Oscar baiting.,4,18 July 2021,"Wow. I don't think I have ever seen a film with such poor writing, yet still being somewhat redeemable. I could nitpick this film for ages. Acting is weird, many of the dialogues are so unnatural and plain Oscar bait. The whole family relation is possibly the most unrealistic I have ever seen in a film, in short, a protagonist is just a free-willed person, going from point to point, without taking responsibility and don't do anything that's been told. His family hates him for not showing up anywhere, but what do they expect? He's a free roamer... Seriously, I blame the family, not the protagonist for everything. They are so selfish and just can't understand that it's the guy's lifestyle and he won't change it, that doesn't mean he's bad willed or anything, you just have to get used to it and that's it. But of course, the family hates him so much that the daughter hasn't even talked to him for 12 years... That's just insane. The sudden shifts in the family's moods and feelings towards the protagonist are so unbelievable, just doesn't make sense. This movie not only does not work as a redemption story, but its message (which by the way also has no subtlety at all) just works almost like with an opposite effect.Also, the editing is bad, it has rough cuts from scene to scene which makes me feel disoriented quite a lot, when I'm watching a new scene, I'm still feeling as if I'm still watching the previous scene if it makes any sense.Also, the protagonist is clearly some kind of Forrest Gump wanna-be, charming and stupid, often doesn't even understand in what trouble he got himself into, yet sometimes plays way smarter than he really is somehow. He made a billion mistakes in this film, yet he also outsmarted others many times. It's quite an impossible to exist character if you ask me.Now for the good parts, if you take out everything about family, it has a pretty good plot about drug smuggling and cartel. The interesting coincidences and all the close calls are a lot of fun.All in all, this is a disaster of a film, but I still enjoyed it somewhat. It had the potential to be a great thriller, but turned out to be some kind of comedic Oscar bait drama.",The Mule
63,masonfisk,ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR OUR OLDEST WORKING DIRECTOR...!,9,25 December 2018,"Clint Eastwood's latest is based on a magazine article where an octogenarian is recruited by a Mexican drug cartel to transport drugs & making a decent heap of cash in the process. Being a man who put his trade in front of his family (the film opens up w/our hero living it up at a flower show instead of going to his daughter's wedding (played by Eastwood's own daughter Alison)) & losing everything, this opportunity to regain stature in his family & friends' eyes is too much to pass up, however fleeting & dangerous it'll eventually become. Shot in his customary lean style where everything on screen is meant to be there, Eastwood makes the most of what could've been a standard exploitation vehicle but his choices speak volumes when violence is apparent in nearly every scene but we never see it when a lesser director would abuse it at every turn.",The Mule

The film moves along quick and is told fluently and pretty straightforward in Clint's no nonsense directing style. Earl does good things with the money he earns from his criminal ventures. He gets compared to Walt Kowalski from Gran Torino, but if you want to look a little closer, these two grumpy old men are very different people, though similar that they both are Korean War vets. There is a little room for humor here, but is mostly a man coming face to face with his failures in life and his chance for redemption.

72,rgkarim,Loading Up The Mule With A Payload Of Story Prowess,8,16 December 2018,"At one time a legendary Western star, the famous Clint Eastwood set his sights on directing and writing more realistic dramas that were meant to appeal to his dedicated fans. The result have been some rather dark, gritty movies that star the legend himself. So this weekend, the next film in his arsenal came out, looking to copy his formula and bring with it another dark tale that could potentially be just as formulaic as the next film. Going in with low expectations, I was not too excited to hit this film. What was the verdict? As always Robbie K, is here to share his opinions as he reviews:Film: The Mule (2018)Director:
Clint Eastwood
Writers:
Sam Dolnick (inspired by the New York Times Magazine Article ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year Old Drug Mule"" by), Nick Schenk
Stars:
Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper, Taissa Farmiga
LIKES:The Acting: It's Clint Eastwood, so you know what you are getting with the man when it comes to his style. Taking his usual gritty tone with gruff presentation, edgy words, and a blunt approach that lacks any filter Eastwood will still appeal to his tried and true ways. Yet, this film sees him adding a little more lightness to his role, bringing some comedy to the mix that feels natural and no longer forced. In regards to the rest of the crew, they hit their usual stride in regards to this kind of character with Cooper having the single-minded focus of tracking down the bad guy in that smoldering manner he does, Michael Peña, being that quirky side kick that is again okay, but not quite displaying his full talents. As for the cartel members, nice displays of stereotypical roles, but not fully diving into the members given the theme of this film. This is definitely an Eastwood focused film, so he'll do most of the lifting.The Story/Character Development: Stereotypical and predictable, but still a deep dive into character development, The Mule accomplishes what many films strive to do. It takes the central character and begins to mold them into something new, no matter where they start. The realistic journey over the course of Earl's journey shows him gradually seeing the light and adjusting life based on the new needs, sometimes hitting blocks, but never so much ignoring everything in the journey to start from square one. It works quite well, especially in the small integration of other characters, helping to display the lesson of teaching others as they teach you, aka the passing of the torch to future generations. This rich focus will appeal to the key demographic, and may also impress some others that have the open mid to give Eastwood's drama a try.The Pace: As I said before, Eastwood's dramas are a little too slow for my taste, especially given the dark tones they take. Yet this film somehow managed to take a detour down the freeway it seems, because it moved quite well for me given the facets of the plot. Despite the look of the trailers, the team did a job of adding some joys of life to the mix, embedding some natural comedy to lighten the tones, and establish an adventure as Earl goes up and down the U.S.A. roads. The integration of these components makes for a better adventure than I could have imagined, and helps bring more people into this particular tale. The new momentum it brought was much more entertaining for me and definitely a plus.The Realism: My final like is the fact that the movie is still keeping in touch with the realistic side of things. The Mule does have its share of soap opera dynamics, but it doesn't plunge so far in that it steers away from the realistic component. As such, it's a relatable tale that is appealing to follow and potentially learn from.DISLIKES:Secondary Characters Flat: It's tough to balance all the plates of characters in a film like The Mule. Nevertheless, there was some ground to still cover when it came to the secondary characters. Some of the cartel members that were important to the plot felt very flat, the richer stories and relationships deep down in their sulking forms. Why they didn't focus better on the relationships, boggles me when that dynamic would have been an enjoyment to watch. In regards to the DEA story, it serves it's purpose as well, helping to establish the chase component of the film that a drama like this needs. Yet, this component still could have had some better integration as well, helping to actually feel like a mystery instead of these checkpoints serving to remind us there was another story going. I didn't so much enjoy this parallel plot approach, but then again it could have been worse.More Suspense: An Eastwood film is known for some edgy experiences to keep you on the edge of your seat, or perhaps make you sweat just a little. The Mule sadly didn't hit that mark for me despite its best attempts. Perhaps it is the lighter aspects that diluted the normal rough and gruff edge he is known for. It could be how predictable the plot is, meaning fewer surprises for me when you see them coming. Or maybe it was the fact that the secondary characters weren't so integrated to give the thriller it wanted as mentioned above. Whatever the reason, the lack of suspense still made the film a little duller than intended.The Ending: Does the finale make sense and fit into the plot? Yes. However, while I appreciate the direction in regards to the character development and the tale wrapping up, it completely derailed the momentum the majority of the film established. The last 20-25 minutes completely changed the course of the film, once again dulling my interest and mood as they turned the corner. At this point, the wrap up was mercifully approached, but not before dragging everything through the mud and leaving me feeling extremely low. Not my favorite conclusion, but I'll acknowledge their direction from story telling aspect.
The VERDICT:The Mule is one of my top films of the Eastwood legacy of thrillers. It has character and a realistic portrayal of someone looking for changing even in the late stage of life that will appeal to much of the target audience. Acting wise it's solid, presentation is straight and to the point, and the new atmosphere of adding light touches of comedy and happiness, make for the more entertaining of the bunch. Still a lack of suspense and use of the other characters takes away from the complete story and suspense that we wanted. Overall a solid film though, and worth seeing in the theater if you are looking to take an Eastwood fan to the movies, but otherwise stay the course for home viewing for this one.My scores are:Crime/Drama/Mystery: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",The Mule
73,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Mule,7,15 December 2018,"Earl Stone (played by Clint Eastwood) is an expert in horticulture. He also neglects his family from time to time and revels in inept, carpool karaoke. When Earl's plant business goes sour and he finds himself almost broke and destitute, crusty Earl decides to become a drug courier with basically one phone call. That's the rub of 2018's The Mule and yup, it's my latest review.Released in the same year as Eastwood's last film (The 15:17 to Paris), ""Mule"" is a step up from ""Paris"". That's probably because Clint decided to take his time more and craft something that doesn't feel like it was rushed into theaters. Oh and did I mention Eastwood got some real actors on board this time?So yeah, Clint's 90-year-old character in ""Mule"" gets with women who are more than half his age (it's creepy yet amusing at the same time). And yes, ""Mule's"" true story adaptation while unvarnished, still feels a little far-fetched. Oh well. Over the span of six decades, Eastwood's ability as a legendary trouper and director has rarely lost the ability to entertain. Sit back and go ahead. He'll probably ""make your day"" (ha-ha).Produced by Eastwood (why not) and featuring his daughter Alison in a visibly underwritten role, The Mule gives Clint a lead stint that is almost perfect for him. He's like that brittle old-timer who doesn't know any better when spewing racial epithets. Remember Eastwood's Walt Kowalski from 2008's Gran Torino and his grandpa Gus from Trouble with the Curve? Well now imagine a sort of friendlier version of those personas.Anyway, ""Mule"" is a streamlined, road trip flick that contains plenty of dope lingo and plenty of tattooed, gun-toting machismo. It will even make you laugh from time to time (some of the humor is actually unintentional). Eastwood's direction as always, is smooth and efficient here even if certain spots drag. Along with himself, Clint also gets good supporting work from Bradley Cooper and Michael Pena (they play DEA agents who are hot on the heels of Earl Stone).Bottom line: The Mule is strictly Eastwood's show being that every other dramatis personae is either undeveloped or void of a real backstory (that's probably because ""squint"" Clint is in nearly every frame). I'm still going with a recommendation though because this ""Mule"" despite certain flaws, has shades of being a minor ""jewel"". I wouldn't dare call Clint Eastwood Clint ""Ego-wood"". Natch. My rating: 3 stars.",The Mule

Sully was surprisingly good, however & pretty entertaining.But after seeing 2018's 15:17 To Paris, I was hoping this would be an improvement over a film which had so little material, it was only 15-20 minutes long. So instead of adding enough but no more, they beefed it up to 94 minutes, with a near full hour being backstory before the title part of the film kicked in. They little materials enough as it was to go on, yet went over kill as a pose to borderline, but even then, it still would've been pointless. But yeah, 15:17 to Paris was a bad film, but this however was better & more enjoyable.The film is about a 90-year-old man who has a bad relationship with his family. Long story short, he choose work over family, a little cliche to be honest but hey ho. It's then a random stranger offers him a job to be a drug mule, to which he earns lorry loads of £££ through each run, but the cartels get suspicious of him & start threatening & intimidating the vulnerable 90-year-old, the police who are after the drug cartels are hot on their scents, but when the threat of being killed or spending time with his family comes to blows, THAT is the real question of what this man will do.The film ran for 109 minutes, which is alright, it wasn't boring. In fact, it kept me interested & a little suspenseful as to what was going to happen next. But I felt the end kind of ruined the film, I won't spoil it, but I myself found it to be a total let down.The film wasn't action packed as such, but that wasn't a problem either given I seen the trailer & it pretty much showed what the film actually was.

Starring Clint Eastwood, Bradley Cooper, Dianne Wiest, Michael Peña, Laurence Fishburne, Ignacio Serricchio, Andy Garcia, Eugene Cordero, Taissa Farmiga, Loren Dean, Alison Eastwood, Lobo Sebastian, Robert Lasardo, Manny Montana. (R)Cash-strapped octogenarian horticulturist Eastwood becomes an astonishingly prolific drug mule for a Mexican drug cartel; Cooper and Peña are the DEA agents closing in on him. Would be staggeringly implausible if not for the fact that the premise is based on a true story (truth is stranger than fiction, after all), but an abundance of dramatic license leaves a fair share of holes and contrivances in its wake. Eastwood gives a typically solid performance (and his smooth, efficient direction works for the material), but his character is never completely persuasive and is too naïve and/or stupid at specific points for the convenience of the plot machinations--example: how could he possibly be shocked when he discovers he's been transporting drugs all along after completing multiple runs? His pursuers have minimal character depth (and ""dogged"" is not how one would describe them), making the entire parallel narrative flimsy and unnecessary. Wiest is underused but still effective as Eastwood's ex-wife; the entire sub-plot with his estranged family (surely included to humanize the ol' codger) could have used deeper exploration and fewer clichés. Despite the shortcomings, Eastwood's confident hand at crafting engrossing drama is still evident, even while bulldozing past moral dilemma, and he makes the movie stubbornly watchable.59/100",The Mule

Surely less prominent actors would have benefited from some of these roles (Head of AFT, Head of Cartel).

90,rockman182,The Mule (2018),7,15 December 2018,"When I heard of this film, first thing that came to mind was ""wow look at this badass, Clint Eastwood still directing AND acting at 88 years old."" Truth be told, his recent films haven't been that great. He's had some really memorable directorial works in the past but recent years haven't stuck out to me. I didn't expect much else with The Mule, it seemed like the type of film we would see from Eastwood; a biographical film that doesn't offer enough to its interesting story. Surprisingly, I really liked this film and its his best since Gran Torino.The film is based on the true story of Leo Sharp, an 80+year old man who becomes a mule for the Sinaloa Cartel. The thing is no one expects it for so long. Even the DEA are stumped on who the mule could be. Eastwood plays Earl Stone (based on Sharp), a man who decides to make the money to not only better his own life but that of his estranged family, with whom he is trying to reconnect with. The dangers of the job are ever present and Stone must comply or face harsh consequences.At first I was thinking that I wasn't feeling Eastwood in the role but then his cooky casually racist old white guy role pulled through and its actually pretty funny. This film is just funny and entertaining. Its about time Eastwood is able to bring a biopic that engages the audience and shows how interesting its subject matter really is. Its not technically amazing or anything but its a joy to watch Eastwood on his cross country journey and his nonchalant attitude and run in with the law, despite there being major consequences.I'm not sure if the film will appeal the masses but I love seeing Clint Eastwood in film, even in his advancing years. So this was kind of a treat to see him pull this performance out of the bag and bring a film that is humorous and touching throughout. Even if Eastwood were to retire from acting and directing after this, I would say he would be going out on a very strong note. One of the pleasant surprise of the year, go see The Mule people.7/10",The Mule

92,RforFilm,"The Mule is like a truck ride: slow and smooth, but is still enjoyable along with Clint Eastwood",7,30 December 2018,"If you've ever seen movies like Midnight Run or a TV show like Locked Up Abroad, then it should be simple to understand that being a drug mule is extremely dangerous. It may be tempting to potentially acquire thousands of dollars for a simple run of a delivery. Along with the fact that the law is being broken, the danger is enough that your working for gun touting people that are too unpredictable to know how their going to react. This is why they tend to only look for people who have nothing to lose or those that are simply naïve to understand the consequences of what their getting into.So why use a senior citizen for the job? Because it's much more unlikely to happen. But it can; and it did. The New York Times published an article I haven't read about a Korean War veteran who became a drug mule in his eighties. That is already an entertaining story, as you don't hear someone that old doing much, let alone something dangerous. Not to mention to be contempt with your position is another factor. This is a rare instance in which someone was both naïve and had nothing left to lose. Who better to tell this story then Clint Eastwood in The Mule.Earl Stone (played by Clint Eastwood) was once a famous horticulturist who may have been popular with his flowers and speaking circuits, but had cost him his relationship with his wife Mary (played by Dianne Wiest) and daughter Iris (Played by Alison Eastwood). Now at ninety, he's fallen on hard times, due to his flower business getting killed by the internet. He's still estranged from his family (with the exception of his adult granddaughter) and his house is about to be foreclosed on.While visiting his granddaughter, he's approached by a guy who tells him about a job where you just drive. Earl accepts and makes his way to El Paso to pick up the package. Though the people he works with give him instructions on what to do, he makes the trip fine, along with a couple of thousand dollars. It doesn't take long to realize what he's transporting (drugs), but decides to keep doing it to try and fix everything broken. At the same time, a new DEA agent Colin (played by Bradley Cooper) is investigating a variety of drug cartels, including the one that Earl Stone is a mule for.I'm glad to see that Eastwood still has a lot of energy in his late life, as he's not only directing well, but also acting well in The Mule. As you may have read from the story summary, this isn't as deep or thick as his earlier work like Mystic River or Million Dollar Baby, but it's also supposed to be that way. The Mule is made as exactly as this story should be; a smooth, almost lazy trip through an urban myth that seems too good to be true. Eastwood has a talent for taking these kinds of stories and making them large without doing so.Like a lot of Eastwood movies, I can't say this has a plot exactly. It's more of a darker slice of life and how their played out. He understands that while could appear boring for some people, it's a better way to establish personality and humanity. Everyone goes through their arcs, even some of the cartel guys, but I won't give that away. They each fulfill an emptiness within Eastwood's character.Because this is a character reliant story, it was important for each one to be as interesting as possible. That is definitely the case as Eastwood is still the likable grump we know, Bradley Cooper does well trying to portray the justice he's trying to serve, and the extended family does fine in their moments whether it's the ex wife trying to find reasons to hate her husband or the daughter feeling the years of hurt from what happened.Not all character actions work completely, especially for Eastwood's character. Even if he was that naïve, you would have thought it would take less time for him to realize that he was carrying drugs. Other then that, I don't have much issue.I'll give this seven old trucks out of ten. I can understand a lot having issue with the slow pace, but it needs to be understood that's how a lot of Eastwood movies are. I think this won't have trouble finding an audience. Go see it and witness how this drive is quite enjoyable.",The Mule

Unfortunately this didn't happen and I found the movie soulless and walked out feeling slightly bemused about what the film was trying to get at.The film is about Earl Stone (Eastwood) who has reached a crisis point with his family life and finances. He therefore decides to turn his luck around by becoming a drugs mule which seems fairly unlikely given his previous lifestyle.As the film progressed was wondering what was supposed to be the takeaway message from the film.

I bought this movie a year ago since I am a huge fan of Eastwood and yes, it's great like almost all his other movies.The movie is based on a true story. It's about a Vietnam war veteran and horticulturist named Earl Stone (Eastwood) that at 88 years old he accepted one last job since he is desperate for money: he becomes a mule transporting cocaine through Illinois for a Mexican drug cartel, and for the job he buys a new truck. In the meanwhile a DEA task force is investigating on the cartel's deliveries to Chicago. Soon trouble begins when Gustavo, a power-hungry cartel man, orders that Earl must be kept under tight control. During one of his cocaine shipments, Earl knows that his former wife Mary is dying and he postpones the delivery to stay near his wife and making amends with her before she dies peacefully after a few days. After the funeral and reconciling with his family, Earl resumes the delivery as the DEA and the cartel are close to him. After a while the DEA finally catches him but I won't spoil the ending for any of you who hadn't saw it.As with all the other recent Clint Eastwood movies it has lots of great elements. The cinematography is very vivid and colorful, the script is terrific and the story is very involving. The acting is the greatest asset in the movie: Clint Eastwood gives a strong and solid performance and it amazes me just for the fact that here he is approaching 90; Bradley Cooper, Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia give great support and all their characters are endearing.If you are a Clint Eastwood fan you will certainly love this movie, but even if you are not you will most likely love this movie because of all the great elements that made it great in the first place.",The Mule

102,bob-the-movie-man,"Eastwood is back, but is he hero or anti-hero?",7,3 February 2019,"It's delightful to see Clint Eastwood back in front of the camera on the big screen. His last starring film was ""Trouble with the Curve"" in 2012 - a baseball-themed film that I don't remember coming out in the UK, let alone remember seeing. Before that was 2008's excellent ""Gran Torino"".""The Mule"" is based on a true New York Times story about Leo Sharp, a veteren recruited by a cartel to ship drugs from the southern border to Chicago.Eastwood couldn't cast Sharp in the movie as himself because he died back in 2016, so had to personally take the role. (This is #satire.... Eastwood's last film was the terrible ""The 15:17 to Paris"" where his 'actors' were the real-life participants themselves: you won't find a review from me on imdb for this one as I only review films I've managed to sit through.... and with this one I failed!).Eastwood plays Earl Stone, a self-centred horticulturist of award-winning daylily's (whatever they are) who is estranged from wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) and especially from his daughter Iris (Alison Eastwood, Clint's own daughter), who now refuses to speak to him. This is because Earl has let his family down at every turn. The only person willing to give him a chance is his grand-daughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga, younger sister of Vera). With his affairs in financial freefall, a chance meeting at a wedding leads Earl into a money-making driving job for the cartel operated by Laton (Andy Garcia). (Laton doesn't seem to have a first name..... Fernando perhaps?).With has beat-up truck and aged manner, he is invisible to the cops and so highly effective in the role. Even when - as the money keeps rolling in - he upgrades his truck to a souped-up monster!It's difficult to know whether Eastwood is playing a hero or an anti-hero. You feel tense when Earl is at risk of being caught, but then again the law officers would be preventing hundreds of kilos of cocaine from reaching the streets of Chicago and through their actions saving the lives of probably hundreds of people. I felt utterly conflicted: the blood of those people, and the destruction of the families that addiction causes, was on Earl's hands as much as his employer's. But you can't quite equate that to the affable old-man that Eastwood portrays, who uses much of the money for charitable good-works in his community.In parallel with the drug-running main plot is a tale of Earl's attempted redemption: ""family should always come first"". When the two storylines come together around a critical event then it feels like a sufficient trigger for Earl to turn his back on his life of selfishness. This also gives room for some splendid acting scenes between Eastwood and Wiest. It's also interesting that Earl tries to teach the younger DEA enforcement agent not to follow in the sins of his past. Bradley Cooper, back in pretty-boy mode, plays the agent, but seemed to me to be coasting; to me he wasn't convincing in the role. Michael Peña is better as his unnamed DEA-buddy.The showing at my cinema was surprisingly well-attended for a Wednesday night, showing that Eastwood is still a star-draw for box-office even in his old age. And it's the reason to see the film for sure. His gristled driving turn to camera (most fully seen in the trailer rather than the final cut) is extraordinary.
He even manages to turn in an ""eyes in rearview-mirror"" shot that is surely a tribute to his Dirty Harry days!If you can park your moral compass for a few hours then its an enjoyable film of drug-running and redemption. I'd like to suggest it also illustrates that crime really doesn't pay, but from the end titles scene I'm not even sure at that age if that even applies!(For the full graphical review, check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

104,silvermistvio,A film with a great message.,5,29 April 2019,"The Mule. Well, when I saw this film introduction on some TV channels, I wondered why would an approximately 90 years-old old man transport drugs and cocaine? After I watched the film, I got the answer for that question.Family! The answer is for family of course. Family is the most important of all in our lives. Some people think that money is the most important thing. If we don't have money, we can't do what we want to do, we can't eat what we want to eat, we'll have to live uncomfortably and etc. I must admit that money is also important too. But compared to the family, money isn't the most important thing at all.On the other hand, if we don't have money, we can find a way to get some. Of course it needs to be in the honest way though. But if we lost family, we won't get them back. That's why family is the most important thing. This is for those who think only money is the most important thing and for those ones who work so hard and can't give time for their families.In this film, the director clearly showed that money isn't important. What it really important is the family. We can't abandon them. While family is important, money is also important too. We have to keep those two in balance. That's what this film is all about.All in all, the Mule shows the importance of families which we sometimes forget. Although it has a great purpose, the presentation is a little bit boring. But I kept watching because I was eager to see when he's gonna get caught. (I feel like I'm naughty. LOL.) Although it's kind of boring, it has a great message and so, it's enjoyable for one time watch.",The Mule

106,kjproulx,"Straight Forward, Yet Highly Enjoyable",8,20 December 2018,"Whether it's with movies like Trouble with the Curve or even more recent movies like The 15:17 to Paris, it should go without question that Clint Eastwood isn't making classics when he puts himself behind the camera over the last decade. I believe Gran Torino was his last memorable film that people will revisit for years to come. With that said, as far as movies he has directed, The Mule is almost good enough to join his club of recent classics. The way he tells this story in a very straightforward fashion may prevent that from happening, but this is a very enjoyable movie from start to finish. At 88 years old, this man shows no signs of slowing down and when you can still have gems like this every now and then, why should he? I had a very good time watching this film and here's why.After being fired from his job of many years, the now 90-year-old man in Earl Stone turns to smuggling drugs in the back of his truck when given the opportunity. Earning the respect from many members of the Mexican Cartel, he becomes a little more entangled with the goings on than he had originally planned. He enjoys the big paydays, but his streak of luck may be soon running out. Being hunted by DEA agents, this story quickly becomes interesting. Cutting back and forth between the two storylines, these two stories made for a very likable overall film. It also doesn't hurt that Eastwood has assembled an all-star cast once again.Obviously, Clint Eastwood as the leading man will please many viewers, as he has become an all-time classic. On top of a great leading performance, Bradley Cooper, Lawrence Fishburne, Michael Peña, Andy Garcia, Taissa Farmiga, and a few notable others support this story with a force that felt needed. I honestly found myself engaged from start to finish, regardless of the pacing. If it were a quiet character moment or a sequence of intensity, I was on the edge of my seat. It's not the most exciting film I've seen in a while or anything of that nature, but it's a film that cares about the story it's telling and just goes for it.As I mentioned, it's very straightforward, which is where I find my biggest complaints. Once the core story kicks in, it does go through the motions that you come to expect from a story like this, with not much new to offer. He is thrust into a life of crime that he didn't expect, he enjoys the fame while it lasts, and it will all eventually collapse in one way or another. For that reason, I wasn't impressed by the movie on a storytelling level, but more on how the story itself was told. I thoroughly enjoyed myself, due to the dialogue that was written by Nick Schenk, who also handled a similar Eastwood character in Gran Torino. I wasn't a big fan of his previous work on The Judge, but I'm happy to see a big improvement here. I look forward to seeing what feature film comes from his screenplays next.Overall, The Mule will surely please fans of Clint Eastwood and fans of this genre in general, but those who go in hoping for a complex story that deviates from the norm may slightly be disappointed. This movie won't likely win any awards, but it's absolutely worth seeing. This is an easy watch with a solid screenplay, great performances, and an overall satisfying narrative. It's not a must see, but I do recommend checking out The Mule.",The Mule

I thought in view the current Trump Mexican scare Campaign mongering that the Mexicans portrayed in this film were stereotypical of Trumps reason to build his nasty wall and that Clint Eastwood's wealth which was estimated at $375 million U.S. In 2015 may have been better spent in the fight to stop the carnage of drug addiction.He doesn't agree with everything Trump says - ""He's said a lot of dumb things,"" Eastwood said - but he thinks that voters need to ""just ... get over it.""""I'd have to go for Trump,"" he said. ""You know, 'cause [Hillary's] declared that she's gonna follow in Obama's footsteps. There's been just too much funny business on both sides of the aisle. She's made a lot of dough out of being a politician.""I won't spoil the movie by listing the improbability of some of the plot twists ,except to say that that the the touchy feely beginning of the movie with lovely flowers and the touchy-feely ending when everyone seemed to think Clint was hard done by ,even Bradley Cooper ,who plays the sweetest well mannered cop I've seen in ages left me wondering after all the hundreds of kilos of drugs he'd effectively delivered to dealers who in turn sold on to addicted teenagers and adults who many of them died of overdoses and had no reconciliation with their heartbroken families.?I guess the movie was entertaining but I didn't like the message or have any empathy with the characters",The Mule

Unfortunately the rise of the internet kills his business, because he can't get to grips with this new technology and he loses everything.He arrives at his granddaughters wedding, is rejected but a random guy suggests he uses his clean driving license to deliver 'packages'. He has no alternative, takes up the offer to transport just one 'package', though he didn't initially appreciate what the cargo was or know who he was working for. It looks like he can fix his financial problems just by driving.The arrangement worked for him because no one was likely to notice a 90 year old white man as a potential drugs mule, he becomes the Mexican cartel's most successful, and remained 'invisible' to the authorities. His cargo sizes increase and he's assigned a handler.

If anyone looks at what he has done as a director especially, whether it is only in that capacity or simultaneously as an actor, that ability to be challenged and succeed is particularly evident, beginning with 1971's PLAY MISTY FOR ME, and continuing with a huge filmography that includes HGIH PLAINS DRIFTER, THE OUTLAW JOSEY WALES, UNFORGIVEN, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, AMERICAN SNIPER, and SULLY, to name just a few. And at the end of 2018, he really flexed himself on both sides of the camera with THE MULE.Eastwood's second film of 2018 as a director (after THE 15:17 TO PARIS), THE MULE is based on a true story written by Sam Dolnick of the New York Times . Eastwood portrays Earl Stone, a Korean war veteran who, in his pursuit of horticulture, has failed his own family as a father and a husband, missing important weddings, birthdays, and anniversaries. And unfortunately, his life is about to take a dark, nightmarish turn as, being strapped for cash, he takes on the job of a ""mule"", or drug-runner, for a sinister Mexican drug cartel kingpin (Andy Garcia), Garcia's ""crew"", such as it is, operates out of a garage in El Paso, just a few miles from the Mexican border, and they force him to transport their sinister ""product"" through the heartland of the U.S. to Chicago, and to do so as to not to attract any unwanted attention from the DEA. Paralleling this, two DEA agents (Bradley Cooper; Michael Pena) are tracking the activities of Garcia's cartel; but it is only late in the game that the DEA, and Cooper in particular, realize that Eastwood (referred to as ""Tata"" by Garcia's employees) is the one being forced to run those drugs, to the tune of a couple of hundred kilograms per month on average. In the meantime, Eastwood tries to patch things up with his family, particularly with his dying ex-wife (Dianne Wiest), all the while being watched and then hunted by the cartel and the DEA.Nick Schenk, who wrote the screenplay for Eastwood's 2008 acting/directing hit GRAN TORINO, handles the screenwriting chores here; and while there are quite a few ethnic slurs and a certain amount of misogyny, THE MULE in general is a deeply humanistic film about a totally inhumane situation in which Eastwood has to do the one thing that his most hard-edged fans sometimes have had a difficult time accepting, which is to show a lot of vulnerability. Frequently, his character has guns pointed at him, as opposed to the other way around; and he can't do a whole lot about that except to follow orders, even though he knows he'll be going to jail for life (at the age of 90) if he's caught. Cooper (who was the star of AMERICAN SNIPER) does an extremely credible performance as the DEA agent, as does Pena as his partner. The film also features solid supporting turns from Laurence Fishburne, Alison Eastwood (Clint's real-life daughter), Richard Herd, and Loren Dean.One must go after Eastwood's films, regardless of what capacity he serves in, because he is not going to be around forever. And while many might find THE MULE to be a touch offensive, ethnically speaking (which it is, but it befits the situation), even with that said, it is another notch in Eastwood's belt, both in terms of his acting and his directing.",The Mule

But take this film in context with Clint's filmography, where he has played a lot of cowboys who fight bandits and played a lot of cops who battled drug dealers...it's a nice addition to his movies. Clint plays an elderly man who has failed to be responsible and destroyed his family. He is given an opportunity to make up for it...but only if he disobeys the drug cartel who he runs drugs for. The script is kinda wonky and uneven, but a solid message of how it is never too late to take responsibility and try to make amends.",The Mule
117,MrDHWong,An enjoyable crime film mainly due to Clint Eastwood's engaging performance,7,27 January 2019,"The Mule is a crime thriller directed by and starring Clint Eastwood. Based on The New York Times article ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule"" by Sam Dolnick, it is an entertaining entry in Eastwood's filmography, despite some minor issues.Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood), a 90-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran, is facing financial difficulties after becoming estranged from his family. One day, Earl manages to find work as a ""mule"" for a Mexican drug cartel, transporting bags of cocaine across the state of Illinois. Due to his clean criminal record and old age, Earl is able to effectively carry out this job to avoid detection from local DEA agents, making large sums of money in the process.Despite its predictable plot, The Mule is an enjoyable crime film mainly due to Clint Eastwood's engaging performance in the lead role. Eastwood can still act reasonably well, in spite of his advanced age and 10 year hiatus from acting, and he does a fine job of keeping the audience invested in the story, although I still believe he is best suited being behind the camera. In terms of tone, this feels like Gran Torino, Eastwood's previous on-screen role, but it does lack that film's emotional punch. There are some awkward scenes of comic relief sprinkled throughout which unfortunately undermine what could have been some great dramatic payoff between him and the rest of the supporting cast. Overall, this film proves that Clint Eastwood has still got it, even after all these years, and that surely must count for something.I rate it 7/10",The Mule

With this movie, I can't say any parts bored me, even if the plot was fairly predictable, and it was enjoyable the whole way through. It also seems very ""polished,"" and seems edited and produced very well.The fact that it's a true story also helps, I think.

With the volume turned off ""The Mule"" functions perfectly. It's simple, a man down on his luck decides to do something illegal to support his community. While this may sound like Robin Hood, Earl is anything but altruistic. He's disppointed too many people, specifically family and now, when he's in desperate need, we realize he's pushed everyone away. Sound familiar? It's really Clint apologizing for his own life. And it comes at an odd time where his ex-wife Sondra Locke had just past away.
Anyway, keeping it short, it's on par with ""Gran Turino"" Same curmudgeon who the world has passed. It still has a taut spin to it. With great supporting cast. Lots of familiar faces.

126,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Casual Old-Clint Role; Casual-Old Clint Role,7,24 December 2018,"Actor/director Clint Eastwood, using very little action and suspense for a supposed crime thriller, is otherwise fun to watch as a 90-year-old makeshift and initially oblivious drug runner both underrated and untouchable like when, in one scene, a traffic cop with a sniffer dog appears out of nowhere, and another time crossing mellow paths with Clint's AMERICAN SNIPER star, Bradley Cooper...But the DEA agent puzzled by this mysterious phantom running a myriad of successful scores could have been played by anyone, as could his partner, forced ANT-MAN comic relief Michael Pena and Laurence Fishburne as a DEA chief, sitting around within a quiet, practically vacant office building. Everything's so breezy in this Lawman B-Story it hardly matters at all. But they're at least a necessary distraction from Earl's annoying and cliché, semi-estranged family, lifted from the only contrived aspect of GRAN TORINO only this time without a house to inherit, or muscle car...Just a new big black truck, and with every run, Clint's Earl makes more and more money and, like Robin Hood, gives it to the poor i.e. friends, family and himself...All that aside, THE MULE is really about pace, belonging to the title character playing mind-games with a group as lethal as the Mexican Drug Cartel i.e. he's old and they're young so they care and he doesn't. At that, Eastwood the actor is a natural and his laidback performance, contagious. But as director, his movie lacks overall intrigue and urgency...Then again, with the exception of a few Cartel patsies making threats (led passively by wannabe old-school gangster Andy Garcia), it's about Clint reminding us he's still around, above ground, and with just-enough charm to fill two hours. But since his Earl doesn't know or care about what's in those bags, driven from a tire shop to a cheap motel, it never really matters to the audience: THE MULE is about the drive, not the destination.",The Mule
127,sweidman-28016,Good Movie,6,4 January 2019,"The Mule Review:The Mule is inspired by the true story of an 80 year old man who got caught as a Mule for a Mexican drug cartel. This was a movie that I was very interested in seeing, as it did star Clint Eastwood in what is probably his last film. I liked the movie but not as much as I thought I would. It has very good performances. Clint Eastwood was very good as Earl Stone. He made this old man someone we could feel for. The other standout was Dianne Wiest as his wife. She had a great performance, especially towards the end. The story was interesting, but it didn't wow me which was my biggest problem. It was kind of predictable and didn't have a big climatic ending like I thought there'd be. I still liked it though. My favorite part of the story was his family relationship. He was a troubled man which lead to many problems which I thought were really good. At the beginning there's a big time jump to show the lifestyle of him, but otherwise there wasn't really a point in having it in there. There was another side plot with Bradley Coopers character which was a big part in the story, yet I didn't find it that interesting. Clint Eastwood did very well directing this movie, much better than his last attempt, The 15:17 to Paris. This isn't a movie that is up for any big awards at the moment. I doubt it will score any nominations come Oscar time. It was a good movie, but critics have been iffy with it while people have been loving it. Especially older audiences since they grew up with Eastwood. I would recommend seeing this movie at some point. It has great performances and a good story.My Grade: B",The Mule

The characters in the story consist of 'Dirty Harry' and some shallow supporting roles. As with 'Gran Torino' (2008) and the early Dirty Harry films, it can be interpreted as promoting racism and racial stereotypes.On a side note, it is hard to watch Clint Eastwood continue to confront his age and eventual mortality in film. This performances was real and heroic, but the last 15 minutes of this film are very sad and difficult to watch.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

There was a good amount of emotion and family drama to the story and a decent collection of characters.

There is no ""action"" in this movie, but the script and directing is so tight that there is no boring moment at all.

134,stevenrotherforth,There's no turning back the hands of time.,8,29 July 2019,"The MuleStarring Clint Eastwood 'The Mule' tells the story of Earl Stone a ninety year old man who becomes a Drugs Mule for the Mexican Cartel.
This is a wonderful film with bags of heart and character. Directed also by Eastwood with his signature style it is often a sad story of a man who has lost connection with his family.
Putting work before those closest to him, Earl Stone finds himself down on his luck when changing times force him out of business and he then naively begins to transport mysterious packages for a bunch of Mexicans.
With the always brilliant Bradley Cooper as DEA agent Colin Bates hot on his tale this becomes a film where you don't want Eastwood's character to be apprehended for his crimes of ignorance.
Eastwood is easily the best part of this movie putting in a sincere performance.
He conveys the knowing that time is of the essence.
If only we all had more of it then maybe we could do things differently.
Eastwood's character acknowledges his failings in life but realises there's no turning back the hands of time.
'The Mule' offers some humour too. This conveyed mainly by Earl Stone.
He is a dinosaur. Full of wisdom but sometimes clueless in a world that is moving forward at warp speed.
This movie had me fully invested from the opening credits. Mainly due to Eastwood's performance and his masterful direction of a compelling story.

135,michaelarmer,Is this the last ?,7,11 December 2019,"Clint has done many excellent movies, I am worried but not surprised if this is going to be his last as an actor, it would be a shame.This is another of the true stories that Clint has made in the last 20 years and is a good one, but not good morally, an ex soldier who's business had gone under so reverted to crime, running drugs for a cartel (unusual because of his age).
I assume Clint thought it was a sympathetic role, and made it that way, and it was another very good movie, he acts with aplomb, it is almost all him, there are supporting actors but he gets the lions share of screen-time (it has been this way in Clint's films since the early 70's, as if he is worried about someone else stealing the limelight), but that is not a bad thing because he is an excellent actor and (like most of his films) he is very good. Dianne Wiest does a good job as his ex-wife, Clint's real life daughter plays his estranged daughter in the film, Andy Garcia gets a cameo as the Cartel Boss, and Bradley Cooper shines as the FBI man, Clint must like him (American Sniper). He directs well, excellent photography (as usual in Clint's films) and a great atmosphere.But something is badgering me with the character (real person), it is the sympathetic angle of a criminal, and family failure, thousands of people would be affected by the drugs which the character delivered, as his family did with his absences. I don't like it, we have enough real heroes (Clint has made a few movies about them) why make movies that sympathise with bad guys. I can only think it is a reflection of his own real life, a moral void in which Clint is self obsessed, manipulative and treats the women in his life with disdain, maybe that is why he made it, to try to show that people like him are not too bad and for the same reason why it might be his last?But saying that it is a very good movie, and so you do ""feel"" for the character, which shows Clint's skill as a film-maker, and why he will be missed, his personal life might be repulsive, but his movie making is excellent.I have given it a 7 because I don't sympathise with criminals, but if the main character was morally sound I would have given a 9",The Mule

Eastwood's ability to keep directing movies at near 90 years of age is just astonishing to me. While he's definitely slowed down his acting in the last decade (I figured Gran Torino would have been his sawn song) he actually managed to put out a baseball movie and now The Mule the true story of a 90 year old man who became the Mexican drug cartals best carrier. While critics have been rather skeptical towards the movie anyone who knows Eastwood can relate to the movie itself, the main story here is that Eastwood's character has never really been there for his family, which in turn has turned his ex wife and daughter against him. When one thinks it makes you wonder if this isn't a real play on Eastwood's real life. After all the man fathered at least 8 known children from 6 different women. I won't ramble on, but, there's enough comedic moments here to level out the dramatic moments. It's a role I believe Eastwood turned into a play on his actual life in some instances and if this is his swan song in acting then what a way to go.",The Mule

138,Mike_Devine,Eastwood's career ages like fine wine,9,25 December 2018,"Clint Eastwood's career seems to be aging like wine, at least it seems that way thanks to some recent standout performances from both a directing and acting standpoint. In 'The Mule,' Eastwood steps into a familiar role - a politically incorrect yet endearing elderly man who is forced to adapt to trying circumstances in the face of change.As the title would suggest, Eastwood's character, nonagenarian horticulturist Earl Stone, falls into a life of schlepping up and down highways with contraband in order to dig himself out of debt. The premise - based on a true story - is enough to pique interest, but the ""Eastwood factor"" undoubtedly helps. There are a few real reasons why 'Mule' works. For one, the cinematography brings to life the often overlooked dry plains of the midwest. Since the setting often defines many other elements of a film, it helps give a feeling of rugged humility.But it's the story of self-awareness and personal growth at the center of 'Mule' that is the most intriguing part of the film. The supporting cast makes this believable, between disappointed family members (Alison Eastwood, Taissa Farmiga, Dianne Wiest) and a DEA agent who learns valuable life lessons of his own (Bradley Cooper). Michael Peña, Andy Garcia and Laurence Fishburne also appear, although none of their performances are that memorable. But Eastwood brings a sense of authenticity to Earl in a way that audiences can relate to him, as if he were their own grandfather, despite his quirks.Even though some have likened 'The Mule' to Eastwood's 'Gran Torino,' they both stand alone as great films and prove the storied actor/director is not slowing down in his advanced age.",The Mule

140,jamiedarlow-37510,Great drama that manages to overcome its flaws,7,17 April 2020,"Inspired by a true story, The Mule follows a 90-year old man who has retired from a healthy career as a florist. Having always put work before family, he's now trying to make up for lost time with a wife and daughter who have been neglected. With his granddaughters wedding up and coming, he's given a tempting offer to do some driving work for an unknown source. Taking the job to secure more money for the wedding, he eventually unwillingly delves deeper into the criminal underbelly and vicious circle of the profession he's chosen. Directed by Clint Eastwood who also stars, it's a great drama with tenderness in its message and unexpected sweetness. The moments this particularly shines in are scenes shared with his wife (Dianne Weist) who is great to see on the big screen again and brings another lovely character to life. Eastwood also never holds back on tension and thrills; the drug smuggling subplot being full of edge of your seat sections and there is a genuine sense of unpredictability in how the story will turn out at times. It's main flaw is that it does have this strange sense of elderly 'wet dream' creepiness to it; although Earl is a lovely guy who doesn't mean any harm through most of the film, there's a sequence half way through of him going to bed with two young ladies and it's one I felt dragged for too long and felt really out of place tonally. This isn't the only time he gets lucky to so to speak and although played for laughs, I think goes the opposite way.

It's based on a true story, only Leo made his runs to Detroit, not Chicago. I liked how it showed that the Feds were just as greedy and ambitious as any corporation or drug dealer out there.

145,Figgy66-915-598470,A directorial masterpiece from Clint Eastwood,10,31 January 2019,"31 January 2019
Film of Choice at The Plaza this afternoon - The Mule. Clint Eastwood stars as Earl, veteran, lover of his award winning lilies, divorced, broke and estranged from all of his family except his granddaughter. Picked on by an opportunist at a party he finds himself with a new job, a Mule for a Mexican drug Cartel. At first he is unaware of the cargo he is carrying in his old truck but as the film progresses events unfold to put him in danger for his life. This film was an excellent vehicle for Eastwood, he plays a guy who is at rock bottom but still very much a feisty old codger not willing to give up. We have three threads running throughout the film, Earl's story, his family, and thirdly Bradley Cooper's character Colin Bates, a DEA agent who wants to bring down the Cartel. We didn't have to sit through high contain car chases, and big gunfights, this film was a lot gentler than that, and even those necessary antagonistic scenes that come in all drug cartel movies were handled almost sympathetically. A great performance by Eastwood, and a great bit of directing by him too. Incidentally, keep an ear out for the soundtrack, a good selection of country music including the beautiful Don't Let The Old Man In, by Toby Keith. A great watch.",The Mule
146,ginocox-206-336968,More family drama than police drama,7,21 March 2019,"""One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn't going to go off. It's wrong to make promises you don't mean to keep."" - Anton ChekhovClint Eastwood's The Mule (2018) hangs an entire arsenal of weapons on the wall that either remain unfired or misfire by the conclusion of the story. Rather than ending with a climatic bang, it goes out with a whimper and a dissatisfying Hallmark moment or two.The screenplay is based on the real-life exploits of WWII Veteran and renowned horticulturalist Leo Sharp. However, the low-key ending cannot be attributed to any effort at fidelity to historical fact, as the actual events culminated in a much bigger bang than the film.Director/producer/star Clint Eastwood and screenwriter Sam Dolnick chose to emphasize themes of regret and family values and to de-emphasize the police investigation and the smuggling operation. We're left with a story with a lot of heart, but little bloodshed; moral struggles, but few fisticuffs; efforts to evade responsibility, but a car chase that makes O.J. Simpson and Al Cowlings seem like speed demons. We learn that Agent Treviño (Michael Peña) has five children, but nothing of his approach to criminal investigations. We learn more about Agent Colin Bates's marital problems than his prior successes in high-profile cases.As a melodrama, the film is very well done. The acting by Eastwood, Cooper, Peña, Fishburne and the others is excellent, as are the production values. A few jiggly-cam shots are noticeable, but not nearly as prevalent or distracting as in many other films. The film avoids distracting political and social commentary, although one reviewer criticized it for feeding anti-immigration sentiments by presenting Mexican drug dealers in an unfavorable light. Perhaps she is disappointed the producers didn't promote diversity by casting a Swedish female as one of the cartel members. Men who have reached the age of fifty-four and can legally date girls a third their age will applaud two scenes in which octogenarian Stone (Eastwood) engages in bedroom gymnastics with two ladies whose combined ages are considerably lower than his own.I would have preferred to see much more of the DEA investigation and drug smuggling operation, and less of the leisurely family scenes.",The Mule
147,movieman6-413-929510,The Mule shows the positive and negative aspects of the older life.,6,9 March 2019,"The Mule is a new crime drama directed by Clint Eastwood, the director of Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River and American Sniper. Clint Eastwood also plays the leading role in the film.The film is about the lone 90-year-old man Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood). After his company has gone bankrupt, he has very little money at his disposal. Earl therefore takes the simple job of driving from point A to point B, but he just does not have to know what he is transporting. Earl does not know that he actually works as a drug courier. Because of his old age and innocent life history, Earl is not seen by the police as a suspect and can work without problems.
Earl comes on the radar of DEA agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) who thinks it suspicious that an old man like Earl of a poor bankrupt man suddenly has a lot of money. Earl must make the right decisions now, before he goes the wrong way forever and falls into the hands of the authorities or the drug cartel and remains stuck here.With this film Clint Eastwood responds well to the topicality of loneliness among older people. Because of the loneliness, many elderly people suffer from depression and make the wrong decisions in their lives just like the main character of this film does. The film also responds well to the innocence of older people, because most of the older people are not easily suspected of working on wrong things. This is how this film plays in an entertaining way with the positive and negative sides of older life.This film looks a bit like films like The Old Man & the Gun and Going in Style where older people also go the criminal path through the same kind of problems that also come to the fore in this film. These films are also partly comedies and are therefore somewhat more entertaining to watch. The Mule is more of a drama film with only a few comic moments. The main character does have a kind of dry humor and still behaves like a man who lives in the world before everything would be politically correct and sometimes knows how to make comments, which people do not say so easily anymore.Clint Eastwood has also cast himself well into the film as an older grumpy man, who despite the loneliness still tries to keep doing what he enjoys. Clint Eastwood has previously played such roles in other films. The rest of the cast also provides good acting and sometimes provide some extra information about the main character, but the film mainly focuses on Clint Eastwood's main character.

148,jb_campo,"Clint delivers, again",7,6 July 2019,"I love seeing Clint Eastwood continue to deliver strong films at this point in his life. In The Mule, Earl Stone (Eastwood) is a divorced grouchy old man who is struggling to keep his life financially viable. He was a professional gardener, but the internet seems to be changing that. He is at the point of losing his home.
He's already on the outs with his family - you gather that he was not the world's best father.Then he gets the chance for some big money, so much that for him it's life-changing. The money allows him to make many positive changes in his life. But he suspects things are not as clean as he'd like.Meantime, the FBI is trying to bust a drug cartel and their mules who transport the drugs. Bradley Cooper plays Bates, the lead agent in charge of the pursuit.That's about it for the story. It's cat and mouse. Earl shows his wiles gained from his life experience, and he gets a bit of luck too. The acting was great, but as many have said, a lot of it was cliche'd lines that teach us life lessons. But, hey, Eastwood can do that because he's passing along those lessons again and again at this point in his life.The Mule allows Eastwood to continue to deliver what his fans want - a tough guy who has had a hard life and is just trying to reconcile how he got to where he did from where he was, and the lessons he learned from that experience. That's worth the price of admission on its own. See The Mule - you won't be disappointed.",The Mule

I have been watching films for the past 30 years, mostly American or European movies (I am not caucasian myself) and their ending are always unpredictable.So, when another film of Clint Eastwood up and running, I decided to give it a try. The result is not disappointing. By the way, I am not a fan of him, but my late father looks like Mr. Eastwood. Stay healthy and fit, would like to see more from you.",The Mule
150,srdjan_veljkovic,An interesting probable goodbye to Clint Eastwood,8,9 April 2019,"This film is interesting for several reasons. One is that it's different from most, if not all, Eastwood movies. Even in Gran Torino, he's still a tough guy, just old. This Eastwood is different. There are traces of a man who is no coward or weakling, but, still, not just because of his advanced age, he's not very tough and mostly goes with the flow rather than directing it.Also, the story itself is rather different. The drug mule is just for show, really, this is a story of a man who was successful in his job, but didn't spend much time with his family, which resents him for it. Mind you, he was not a really bad father/husband, he didn't do anything really wrong. He just wasn't there. His business has failed and he's sorry for how things are with his wife and daughter and tries to make it better.Contrast this to Gran Torino, story about a man who's son is a _bad_ son, towards the end, Eastwood can't even bring himself to tell him he's dying and goes on to sacrifice himself for his ""adoptive"" family, rather than try to make things better with his own son.It's hard to say are both these movies self-reflective or, at least, to which degree - including his own daughter to play the daughter of the drug mule kind of indicates this one is. But it's interesting that both exist and it kind of makes you think about life and its perspectives. For one, Eastwood has many children, it's quite possible one of those is a bad son and one is a daughter he's sorry he didn't spend more time with.If we take this context away, the movie is OK, though nothing special. There are several nice jokes in the movie, most of all dealing with usual perception differences between generations. It's fun at times (mostly when Eastwood is singing while driving). Eastwood does try to actually act, not just ""be tough by way of not moving parts of his face"", and it's just-good-enough. The sequence with the mule's dying ex-wife is touching. The story and it's pace are fine, but, there are many ways it could have been made better, which a younger Eastwood could have done. Just compare this to ""Unforgiven"" and you'll see a huge difference thereof.Compared to the declared goodbye movie by Robert Redford ""The Old Man and the Gun"", this is a better movie, but, Redford's one is more in line with the character of Redford we know, so it has a nicer ring to it. Eastwood hasn't declared this is his last movie, but, it likely is and if it becomes that, it's quite alright.Still, would like to see Clint Eastwood play the ""Man with No Name"" one last time, just for fun.",The Mule
151,williampsamuel,"A Moving, Meloncholy Morality Tale, Flaws and All",7,17 March 2019,"If you've seen the trailers for the Mule then you know the basics. Old man who thinks he nothing to lose gets in too deep with the Cartels, while grappling with the choices that have brought him to this point and the ever-growing dread of how it will all end. Beyond that, this is an earnest, often melancholy reflection on family, growing old, and sometimes the nature of race in America. The handling of these is issues is sometimes uneven, but the journey is still a good one.What really holds this movie together is Eastwood's heartfelt performance. In recent years he's gotten very good at playing the cranky, tired old man in movies like Grand Torino and Trouble with the Curve. All of that is on full display here. The crotchetiness, the fatigue, the deep longing for the ""good old days"" and stubborn refusal to change with the times, plus the occasional mischievous streak. Only here it's coupled with a deep sadness and sense of loss much deeper than in his previous roles. As geriatric horticulturalist Earl Stone he's a broken man who's pushed away his family, lost his business and his house, and is utterly broke and increasingly desperate.It's somewhat ironic then that his introduction into the criminal underworld begins with such a sense of naiveite. He's been everywhere and and seen plenty of things in the war, but when he first pulls into the pick-up point in the old garage, he clearly has no idea what the hell he's getting into. Surely, he knows it's something illegal, but it doesn't seem to occur to him just how illegal, or how hard it is to back out of this job once he's started. He wizens up quickly enough though, and that's when things start getting interesting.The pacing may be a bit slow at first, but it gets there. With each successive run the tension increases ever so slightly, and there are some very close brushes with the authorities along the way. By the midpoint this movie is becoming as much a suspense thriller as a morality play, and that's before his relationship with his cartel handlers really starts to change. The broad arc of the plot is fairly predictable, but it still manages to generate some real suspense, and an occasional surprise. The ending is also predictable and honestly inevitable, but it's the one the story deserves.The film's central message about the importance family is delivered rather heavy handedly, and at greater length than might be strictly necessary. But it still connects and at time generates real pathos, as in certain scenes with Earl's former wife. Yes, this movie can be something of a tearjerker, but in a sincere, meaningful way that can be as heartwarming as it is heartbreaking.This movie's main problem is that it leans much too heavily on the old man says something offensive trope for humor. You can only have a cranky old man tell people to get off their phones so many times before it gets old. Having him say unintentionally racist things gets old much faster, especially when directed to people who didn't have it coming. There are times when it works, but the filmmakers should have used it much more sparingly.Overall then this isn't Eastwood's best, or most even work. But despite its flaws it's still a heartfelt, deeply personal, and engaging drama with an excellent late career performance from its star/director. If you're a fan of Eastwood this should satisfy. And it will certainly give you a lot to think about.",The Mule

Even with his probably greatest flop: the American sniper, which is still better than 98 percent of the American movies out there.
I understand that this movie also contains his reflections to his past life, him being mostly everywhere but home. The article that inspired the movie was just a motive to carry out a rather personal story. It is also understandable that being old and all will significantly slow him down, but I sincerely hope we'll see more of his work in times to come.

He's a great actor and a good director, no more and no less.
I liked ""The mule"" exactly because of his acting and the character he plays. An old man who wasted his whole life out there working or hanging out with the guys and not paying much attention to his family and loved ones - I can relate to that. Damn, I bet every second person on the planet can relate to that and that's what makes me want to sympathize with his character and I totally understand his motives and actions. But the whole point of the movie is just so unforgivably shallow: we all know that family comes first; we got that already from the Fast and the Furious movies but a Clint Eastwood movie promoting the same values and even in the kind of similar way - that's what you call lazy writing in my opinion. Overall I liked the pacing of the movie, lovely soundtrack, outstanding performances, especially Clint's and Bradley Cooper's because they're the only ones who have more than two lines of background story for their characters, the rest of the characters are just fillers but very good ones. 7/10 just for Mr Eastwood and his grumpy old Earl.",The Mule

He takes the job working for one of the Mexican drug cartels and becomes a Mule. DEA Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) is on the job to stop drug traffic. Earl is estranged from his family who want nothing to with him because he was never around and didn't know where he was all that time. Grand-daughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga) is the only one who still likes and talks to Earl.This is a sad, but true story and also very well paced and quite enjoyable. Of course, if he wasn't 90-yrs old he probably would not have gotten away with some of the things he said to the Cartel people. True they wanted to kill him because he never followed instructions and drove at his own pace and even left his route for a week to attend the funeral of ex-wife Mary (Diane Wiest).When Earl was driving the route, the cartel guys had a listening device planted in his truck so they could hear everything said in the cab. When Earl sang some popular songs the cartel guys also got caught up in the song and sang along, too, (unknown to Earl, of course). Kinda funny. The music all around is very good.Earl bought a new truck with the drug money, of course, a Lincoln Mark something. I mention this because I have never seen that model truck on the road. Quite a majestic truck. Very coolEarl gets caught by snitch Luis a Cartel worker forced to work with the DEA. He knew about the black pick-up but not about the 90-yr old behind the wheel.Unknown to Bates he does encounter Earl in a Waffle House whereby Earl tells Bates that family is the most important thing and not to lose sight of that.Notables: Laurence Fishburne as Colin Bate's Supervisor; Allison Eastwood as Iris, Earl's daughter; Michael Pena as Agent Trevino who works with Bates; Ignacio Serricchi as Julio, Earl's handler; Eugenc Cordero as Luis, the Snitch; Andy Garcia as Laton, the first Cartel boss Earl sees and Laton calls Earl El Tata; Robert LaSardo as Emilio a cartel sub boss and enforcer.Keep in mind that Clint Eastwood directed this. The story is based upon Leo Sharp, who we do not see at the end.We see Earl make up with Mary, his ex-wife, and the rest of the family, and his family tells him they will visit because they know where he is now.

164,Bertaut,"Laconic, measured and easy to digest, although it could have done with more substance",7,13 February 2019,"63 years since he first appeared on-screen in an uncredited role in Revenge of the Creature (1955), The Mule is 88-year-old Clint Eastwood's first acting role since Trouble with the Curve (2012), and his first film as a director since about a week ago. It is, however, the first time he's directed himself since the excellent Gran Torino (2008). Known for being incredibly efficient when it comes to filmmaking, Eastwood likes to get scripts into production before they've gone through too many rewrites, he rigidly shoots only what's on the page, he avoids multiple takes and on-set experimentation, and he keeps the editing process as simple as possible - so basically, he's the anti-Terrence Malick. With this in mind, he has maintained an extraordinary rate of turnover, with The Mule the 37th feature he's directed since Play Misty for Me (1971).Of course, when you work at that rate for as long as he has, you're going to put out a few duds, and although his directorial output has gone through ups and downs in the past, his most recent work has been arguably the most disappointing of his career, with pretty much everything he's directed since Gran Torino being subpar. Whether it's the hokey sentimentality of Hereafter (2010), the oversimplification (and awful makeup) of J. Edgar (2011), the lifeless Jersey Boys (2014), the unashamed and troubling jingoism of American Sniper (2014), the unnecessary embellishments of Sully (2016), or the spectacularly misjudged experiment in casting that was The 15:17 to Paris (2018), the days when he could direct no less than seven masterpieces - Unforgiven (1992), A Perfect World (1993), The Bridges of Madison County (1995), Mystic River (2003), Million Dollar Baby (2004), Flags of Our Fathers (2006), and Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) - in a 14-year period are long gone. Indeed, the most notable thing he's done in the last decade is ramble somewhat incoherently to an empty chair.The bad news is that The Mule is a strangely formless film, almost a collection of only vaguely connected scenes rather than an actual narrative with forward momentum; it has precious little depth or nuance; there's some troubling casual racism, most of which we're encouraged to laugh at; the tone is all over the place; Eastwood's character has not one, but two threesomes with young women; and it wastes almost all of its excellent cast. The good news is that, somehow, it's extremely enjoyable.Telling the story of Earl Stone (Eastwood), a 90-year-old horticulturist and Korean War veteran, who becomes the Sinaloa Cartel's most prolific drug mule, the film is written by Nick Schenk, based on Sam Dolnick's 2014 New York Times article, ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year-Old Drug Mule"", which tells the story of Leo Sharp, a horticulturist and World War II veteran who became the Sinaloa Cartel's most reliable mule.The first thing to be said about The Mule is that the trailer is misleading. Suggesting a tense, nail-biting thriller in which Stone is appalled to find out what he has been transporting, but is unable to back out of his deal, and must try to keep the Cartel on-side whilst evading the attention of the DEA, the trailer has next-to-no relationship with the actual film. It's not tense, Stone isn't overly concerned when he learns what's in the bags, and the very narrative structure means it's inevitable that the DEA will catch up to him sooner or later. It most certainly isn't the Michael Mann-esque crime thriller it's being advertised as. The Mule is laconic and contemplative, laid-back and not especially dramatic. Indeed, as drama, The Mule is fairly insubstantial, telling a threadbare story populated by underwritten characters, void of much of an emotional core, and with next-to-nothing in the way of a dénouement.Eastwood plays Stone as full of regret, someone who knows he was a terrible husband and father, and who is attempting to make up for his mistakes with his daughter Iris (Alison Eastwood) by being there for his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga). From a physical standpoint, Eastwood looks noticeably older than he did in Trouble with the Curve; he walks hunched over, he looks frail enough for a strong wind to knock him down, there's next-to-no meat on his arms. Almost all of that Eastwood-ruggedness is gone, and this is easily the most physically vulnerable we've ever seen him on screen.In a lot of ways, Stone is not unlike Walt Kowalski, the hateful racist character Eastwood played in Gran Torino. They are both Korean War veterans who find themselves alienated from the world they live in, and who believe the next generation lack fortitude. However, Stone is much softer, and on the universal scale of racism, whereas Kowalski is Mel Gibson-racist, Stone is Prince Philip-racist; the type of racism we forgive because he's 837 years old, half-senile, and grew up ""in a different time."" Sure, he calls Hispanics ""beaners"" and jokes about them getting deported, but they don't seem to mind. Sure, he pulls over to help a black couple change a tire, proudly telling them he likes ""to help the negro folks out"", but they just politely inform him that people don't use the word ""negro"" anymore. These examples are played for laughs, and whilst that might be fair enough in a film that depicts non-Caucasians with something resembling diversity, The Mule's non-white characters are one-dimensional stereotypes; every Hispanic character, for example, is either a drug-running criminal or an industrious labourer. If the film itself didn't come across as so racially reductive, Stone's racism would be easier to accept and defend.Perhaps the film's most egregious failing, however, is that it never once addresses the fact that Stone's criminal enterprise is fuelling addiction and destroying lives. The darker implications of his drug-running are kept firmly behind the curtain, out of sight of the audience. Instead, The Mule presents Stone as almost a modern-day Robin Hood, using his new-found cash to pay for Ginny's wedding and education, and to renovate the local VA hall. Even when the film has no option but to deal with his criminality, it's done in such a way as to minimise the darker aspects. For example, Laton (Andy Garcia), the head of the Cartel, may be the most jovial and least-threatening drug lord ever put on screen. García does what he can, but given the fact that most of his screen time sees him fooling about with a solid gold shotgun, his options are limited. A much more effective character is Gustavo (Clifton Collins Jr.), Laton's henchman. Collins Jr. is a superb actor, and can do legitimately intimidating in his sleep, but even an actor of his calibre can do little with only three scenes, in two of which he doesn't even have any dialogue.Hand-in-hand with the film's non-threatening drug runners is its depiction of local law enforcement, who are, for the most part, presented sarcastically (at one point, Stone distracts a pesky cop with a tub of caramel popcorn). A key scene in relation to the film's depiction of both law-enforcement and minorities, but one which is disappointingly played for laughs, is when the cops pull over who they think is their man only to quickly realise their mistake (it's a young Hispanic) and they're guilty of racial profiling. The man is terrified, well aware of stats concerning police shootings of non-whites (there's something deeply unsettling about how well he knows the routine, and his line, ""statistically speaking, this is the most dangerous five minutes of my life"" speaks volumes about modern America). The scene should have given rise to a socio-political commentary but Eastwood is more interested in guffaws. We've seen racial profiling and resultant deaths examined in several recent films - Widows (2018), The Hate U Give (2018), and Monsters and Men (2018) - as well as older titles such as Crash (2004) and Fruitvale Station (2013), but the depiction here is very shallow.Another issue is that the film's structure is bizarre - there's no real sense of narrative cohesion, as one scene jumps to another without a huge amount connecting them. You could take the various driving scenes, cut them in a completely different manner, and you would still have the same film. The whole thing feels void of urgency, and after a while you realise that the threadbare outline of a story is all the story you're going to get. Additionally, there's an utter lack of tension, and the way Eastwood's camera leers at the bare posteriors of a bunch of women at a party in Laton's house is disconcerting, and pretty much a textbook example of the male gaze. Also, with the single exception of Stone, the characters are one-dimensional at best.However, irrespective of these failings, I thoroughly enjoyed The Mule. It could and should have been a lot better. It could have been a socially conscious thriller looking at racial profiling, drug-dealing, American masculinity, generational conflict, socio-economic issues. But, in fairness, that isn't the film Eastwood set out to make. He has made many interesting political films in his career. The Mule is not one of them. Instead, he's turned the material into a jaunty, congenial, inoffensive, and easy-to-watch meditation on age and family, set in a milieu where the one-time trappings of male success are now considered character failings, and focused on a character unable to wrap his brain around this shift in ideology. Despite myself, I can forgive the casual racism, the structural problems, the wasted cast, the use of serious social issues to get cheap laughs, and I can do so because the film is simply enjoyable.

166,MJB784,I feel disappointed if this is his last acted movie,6,14 December 2018,"I was disappointed. It wasn't very suspenseful at all for either the drug cartels or DEA after Eastwood. The pacing is surprisingly casual and it had laid back music. None of the music in the trailer was in the movie and certain scenes in the trailer were irrelevant. I do like the family aspect about how many regrets he has not being with his family. There were a few funny parts, but as a crime movie, the good guys and bad guys were blah. Not a bad choice, but his previous three as an actor were better. The best part was the last act, but not enough for me to recommend the movie.",The Mule
167,heisenberg12,Just Okay,5,24 May 2020,"Ouch. I wanted to like this and was holding out hope after reading some not so good reviews when it came out, but those not so good reviews were basically right; the movie never quite takes off or totally defines itself.What probably bothered the most was how they have Eastwood and the Mexican Cartel, but not one single shootout or action sequence at all whatsoever. I know this is based on a true story, but to equate those two dynamics, you would expect at least some action sequences. And at times, the suspense was building in a way which it seemed like it may climax in some big whopper, but hard to believe, it never happens.Rather, the climax involves a very sentimental and sad scene with his family, and although I can appreciate that, think it would have been better as a subplot only and there should have been a standoff. There's nothing wrong with subverting expectations, but the movie could have been so much better with a vision for an action scene where Eastwood takes some enemies out.On the good side, I did enjoy the first half hour, but that's what was building my expectations that were never reached. It had a couple of good scenes thereafter, but it was never consistent enough and I felt like it dragged a bit in the middle. Some scenes didn't make much sense and could have been edited out with nothing lost. Oh, well, you can't win em all, and Eastwood rarely misses but here he came up a little bit short. Richard Jewell was definitely a return to form we're used to after this one.5/10",The Mule

175,PCT1970,A Different Squint,7,5 May 2019,"This is an edited review from when I saw this film upon it's release. I gave the film a like, but I was less than impressed with the film and didn't bother with analysis nor did I follow my standard format. I revisited this film last night and realized I had misjudged the movie. I let my emotions fog my mind. Nostalgia had taken over and my senses were elsewhere when I was at the theatre. I was longing for Clint 'The Squint' from his days starring in Leone's spaghetti westerns and portraying characters such as 'Dirty' Harry, Philo Beddoe and William Munny. I have written hundreds of reviews on three major sites and learned a lesson. Becoming exceptional at one's passion requires constant awareness and continuous learning. Following is my review of, ""The Mule"". Eastwood directs a significant drama based on true events. All the actors involved deliver appreciable performances. In particular Cooper, Pena, Garcia, Fishburne and Collins Jr. stand out. However Eastwood commands the screen. His ability to deliver dialogue that encompasses topics such as relationships, bigotry, criminal activity and redemption is done with ease and subtlety. The plot revolves around Earl who is a 90 year old Korean War veteran with a failing horticulture business and is estranged from his family which almost reflects the true life relationship between Eastwood and his daughter Alison who stars as Earl's daughter in the film. My opinion is that his penchant for growing flowers and gardening is symbolic of replacing the family he has lost. Earl is made an offer to make a delivery to earn some much needed revenue. He doesn't ask any questions and is committed to making one delivery. Upon receiving his payment, which is a substantial amount, it becomes clear to Earl what he is delivering. He has the money he needs, but decides to continue delivering, using the money for good purposes such as saving his local VA Center and paying for his daughter's wedding in the hopes of mending broken fences. This is symbolic of his generation as compared to today when a person would most likely continue to deliver narcotics for the sole purpose of greed. Earl is being followed by the cartel and is given strict instructions to go from point A to point B with no exceptions. However Earl stops when, where and for whatever purpose he wants to. The leader of the cartel, Laton cuts Earl slack because he is very good at what he does. Earl is so proficient because he has been traveling highways his entire life never receiving a single ticket and he is also so unassuming. Earl is comfortable driving along singing songs and eating snacks which is humorous to see. The cartel continues to increase his cargo and the increased flow of narcotics catches the attention of the DEA. In steps Agent Colin Bates. After reaching double digit runs Bates has pinpointed the route, the type of vehicle and the timing of the deliveries. Earl's apprehension is imminent. Earl has never missed a delivery and has never strayed off course. He is faced with a choice that will literally have his life at stake as he no longer has the protection of Laton. The plot is clever, vivacious, insightful, gritty, blazing, emotional, poetic and has a cathartic ending. There are many memorable scenes and quotes in the film. My favorite scene is when Earl is pulled over and hoodwinks the police officer by, without being asked, dropping his tailgate revealing copious kilos of narcotics in plain sight. My favorite quote is when Earl says to Mary, ""Alright seriously. I've become a drug mule for the cartel. I've got three hundred and five kilos of cocaine sitting right in the back of my truck out there"". Mary's look and response is riotous. This is a formidable film in it's genre. I hope Mr. Eastwood makes another appearance by any means. It would, ""Make My Day"".",The Mule

178,adrian-43767,Clint portrays endearing old man in superbly directed film,9,1 February 2019,"I have just watched THE MULE and enjoyed it very much. I would rate this Eastwood's third best directorial effort, after MILLION DOLLAR BABY and MYSTIC RIVER. His control over his own performance, the rest of the cast's performances, photography, and cinematic fluidity is a case study, not least because Clint was 88 years old when he started this project.I honestly think this is Clint's most rounded, sensitive and perceptive acting role to date, and to think that he was directing himself only increases my admiration and respect for his immense skills. He makes his character an endearing old man, and I suspect that Earl Stone is a more than slightly autobiographical portrait, which adds to the movie's interest.Another great aspect about THE MULE is that it never takes a moralistic view, but gently reminds everyone that time with your family is the single most important thing in one's life.Other great facets to THE MULE include the self-deprecating humor, the dry delivery, the soundtrack (the scene where the two drug dealers begin by despising Earl's outdated musical taste, to which they listen through a tapping device) only to start singing along after a while, is a hoot!Strongly recommended.",The Mule

When I saw this movie, I knew it will be at least very good. And so it is. I like his character, the old grower and cultivator of prize winning flowers, which slided into some gang dealings by overdue payments. It surely has some humor in it, when a 90 year old guy happens to be a drug courier and won't be grabbed, because no one would suppose this good old man as a criminal. This movie did amuse me very well, even though it is clear from the beginning that the end can't turn out well. It's one of the most lovely drug related movies in the last ten years. I recommend it strongly.",The Mule

183,DimitrisPassas-TapTheLine,Clint Eastwood's Swan Song.,6,27 March 2019,"This is a movie that greatly disappointed me as I was expecting a fast-paced, suspenseful thriller and after watching the first hour I was convinced that there was nothing intriguing as far as the plot is concerned. Eastwood is decent in the role of Earl Stone, a ninety year old horticulturist and Korean War veteran who transfers massive amount of drugs on the behalf of the Mexican mafia. Earl is tempted by the easy money and gradually becomes more and more important for the cartel as he is the perfect mule, an old man with -seemingly- nothing to hide, a man that no police officer would search extensively in a road block.
This is the premise of the story, but ''The Mule'' is basically a character study from a director who tries to compromise with his own mortality. Earl is struggling to restore the broken family relationships, with his wife and daughter and the movie focuses on the protagonist's attempt to repair something that he thought was long gone. This is not a drawback per se but the audience should be properly warned about the nature and mood of the film in order to indulge in its melancholic imagery.
The direction as well as the performances by the actors are of high quality, and -in a way- counterbalance the weak plot of ''The Mule''. If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood's films make sure not to miss it, though if you expect a tight, action-packed crime/thriller better look elsewhere.",The Mule

Based on a true story, it has a nice sub plot about family, and a man who has let them down way too often over the years. I enjoyed this picture more than the recent 'Old Man and the Gun', which was also good! This well may be Clint's acting swan song, but I'd love him to find a comedy western to go out on, where he could play an old prospector or 'geezer' of some kind?

192,schroederagustavo,Major Disappointment,5,23 June 2019,"I was really surprised by this movie. Unfortunately I was surprised in the wrong way. I think Clint Eastwood is one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, I usually love his movies. Mystic River and American Sniper are really good films that I thoroughly enjoyed. In The Mule, we follow a 90-year old man who is really into flowers, but has always put ""work"" in front of family. Which from the very start is definitely not true. I mean it's implied during the opening scene that they guy missed his own daughter's wedding because he was having drinks with his buddies. And it's not like he forgot, because in that scene in the bar, there is a wedding reception or something and his expression definitely shows that he remembers that his daughter is getting married. But, he decides not to show up anyway. So ""work"" is mostly just doing whatever that doesn't imply being with his family.12 years later, the internet takes over the flower business and this guy is broke. I can't even remember his character's name in the movie, so from now on we'll just call him by the nickname he is given later on in the film: ""Tata"", which is spanish slang from ""grandpa"". So Tata is pretty much hated by his daughter and ex-wife but his granddaughter kind of still has faith in him, since he offered to pay for a big part of her wedding. He doesn't have the money to even pay for his own property, so he's screwed. However, he gets to know this guy for like 30 seconds, but the guy offers him a job anyway. The job? All he has to do is drive. What better thing for Tata? Oh, I remembered his name. His name is Earl. OK. But it's pretty obvious from the start that this job is something sketchy and from the time he gets to the location and gets the instructions, it's clear that he's gonna be moving drugs of some kind from point A to B. Which makes his character really dumb because at one point in the film, during his third run, I believe, he decides to peek into the bag they gave him (which they clearly said he should not open) and of course, there are huge bags of cocaine. But he acts surprised anyway, so he had no idea? And suddenly, a cop is behind him, parked and everything. So he didn't hear the cop car pull up behind him?At a point in the movie, Tata has a cartel guy assigned to babysit him, so he stays on schedule, doesn't do any weird stops along the way, etc. So, Tata just doesn't care at all and continues to do some unauthorized stops anyway, invites some hooker over in a motel nearby, etc. This babysitter guy clearly dislikes Earl and his ways. It's very clear from the moment he is shown on screen. But like two scenes later they're at a party and suddenly it's almost like they're best friends. Like, when did that happen?I think the main problem with this movie is that if feels like it has a lot of seeds that could potentially blossom into a beautiful flower, but they never do. All of the ideas are kind of explores, but left completely without proper development or a satisfying resolution. Some of the dialogue, particularly between the mexican cartel members, is just awful. Like straight out of a telenovela. And another big problem is just the waste of talent. You have great actors in here like Michael Pena, Bradley Cooper and Lawrence Fishbourne, who are all completely wasted in the film. They barely have any dialogue between them at all and when they do it just feels very generic, like stock character dialogue. I can't even say what their characters are because they are so bland and generic.In the end, the main message of the movie attempts to be that family should always be put behind work or whatever. But it makes no sense at all, since Earl just admits that he did all of these crimes and is sent to jail anyway. In jail, he's rarely ever gonna see his family, but at least he's gonna pay for his crimes, right? Nope. In the final scene of the movie, we see him planting and taking care of flowers in jail, with a big smile on his face. So all of that trouble of always putting family behind work, to end up doing the same work that separated him from his family in the first place. I'm sorry, but it makes no sense whatsoever. I'm pretty sure Eastwood was trying to put a message in there about how flowers blossom into a beautiful thing and how work should always be second to family, but it just didn't work for me at all. This was a very disappointing movie for me.",The Mule

No way he could have gotten credit for a new luxury ride since his property was in foreclosure.

Eastwood delivers another quality turn and his ensemble cast provides a strong supporting role.The story is straightforward, but the poignancy is increased due to the reality that Eastwood is closer to the end of his career than to its beginning. There have been few in Hollywood like him, and it is doubtful there will ever be many more!The nuances of age is presented well, along with glimpses of generational gaps. None of this is delivered in a preachy or bombastic manner, but instead understated, just like Eastwood plays his own character.We see a man of integrity get caught up in a terrible situation and initially enjoy it, only to be bitterly introduced to the ugly side of criminal life. At the end, the outcome is as much a relief for the character as an end to his efforts.Perhaps in a day not too distant from now, the full quality of his production and acting in this film will be properly appreciated, and in that development we can only hope that Hollywood becomes the better for such a realization.",The Mule

201,Endless_01,"A film with a message more meaningful than what is presented to the eye. More than action, it's context.",9,19 December 2019,"Closing with a golden brooch, Clint Eastwood continues to demonstrate both his acting abilities and his incredible hand in directing and creating fantastic films that burn slowly within the audience.The Mule is initially presented as a suspenseful story about a 90-year-old guy who ends up becoming one of the best drug cartel mules. However, the film goes beyond that. It is an emotional journey characterized by a subtle but brilliant character creation, the main character is a battered old man who ends up making decisions that cost him terribly at the end of his life. Giving his last moments to what he is really worth. The film becomes, in my opinion, a work of great emotion and feeling that presents a deeper and more mature message that can resonate quite well with a specific audience.One flaw that it may have is the fact that the secondary story feels slightly set; like an extra stuck in something primary that simply seems to be more of a viewer's window than a full story. The film starts out as a thriller or an action movie, but is actually more dramatic; which is why some people might be confused by this film.But that doesn't change the fact that this is a great work with a deep meaning.

202,trevorwomble,Average but still watchable,7,26 January 2019,"It's great that Clint is still active as an actor. He's perfectly fine in this film, it's well directed as usual but lacks the emotional impact of other more recent films he has directed (such as 'Sully') and it's hard to see why. Maybe there's an element of sadness at seeing a near 90 year old Clint in front of the camera, even though he's one of the few actors in that age range still active enough to play a character like this (personally I think Robert Redford would have been a good choice) and Clint has been making a lot of true stories over the last few years. In that respect this film does its job well enough.The supporting cast do their jobs well enough, Diane Wiest especially as his ex wife,but credit to Bradley Cooper and Laurence Fishburne as DEA agents on his tail and his real life daughter does a decent job as his on screen one. It lacks tension at times but otherwise this is a solid if unspectacular film from the great man. The bad language may put off some of the older generation to whom Clint Eastwood would appeal to but seeing as the subject matter is adult i would hope nobody would be that naïve.As Clint Eastwood films go this is fairly average but it's still great to see he has huge on screen presence as well as being a genuine Hollywood legend. Nobody wants to get old but Clint at least does if with gusto.",The Mule

1. there is nothing bad morally in being a mule for a drug cartel. 2. you earn a lot of money doing 1. 3. drug dealers are nice people. 4. you can cheat your family all your life, then give them money and be accepted back with love. 5. prison is joy. What else we learnt? that one can put some drama into a movie, a young relative kills the drug baron etc. and this has no effect on the plot, it just makes the movie longer.

We've enjoyed the Dirty Harry films several times and most of the others as well.
In the Mule he brings such great talents as myopoic Diane Wiest - we still remember Edward Scissorhands and her great contribution to that film. Andy Garcia is such a convincing drug lord all the time I'm afraid he may decide to become a real one. I hear the money's good.
Mr. Eastwood's truck always looked so pristine, whereas Mr. Sharp's truck was said to be a disasteer of garbage...but a good hideout for drugs. Mayhe he wasn't suffering from dementia as much as they thought. It took a pretty sharp (no pun intended) fellow to do all that driving all along at almost 90.

The Mule is an Instant classic.

215,eparazak,"The Mule presents a fascinating, yet flawed story about work and family.",7,21 December 2018,"The Mule is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars him as 90-year-old drug runner Earl Stone. After years of family neglect and being a workaholic, he begins to go through foreclosure. Fortunately, he gains a job to transport drugs worth a lot of money. At the same time however, he is being followed by a DEA team run by Bradley Cooper.I was interested in seeing this movie since I don't have much experience with watching Eastwood movies and this may end up being his last movie. Either way, this movie is actually pretty good. It was well-acted, well-shot and had a mostly well-told story. Clint Eastwood is great in this. I just love his performance of this man with an attitude and yet he's still fairly likable. We want him to succeed despite his quirks; he felt believable in his need for survival. I also thought Bradley Cooper was great in this performance. He felt intimidating, for instance there is a scene with him and Earl before the third act which made me feel uncomfortable since they were both unaware that they were going against each other. This movie also has a good moral regarding work and families, which in this day and age feels especially needed.The biggest problem that does bring this movie down for me however would have to be the pacing of the first half. It felt really slow in my eyes and in general had very little tension between Stone and Cooper's character. It felt really long and drawn-out and I was genuinely bored throughout it. It's at least nice that the second half really picks things up.Despite a rough start, I did enjoy what this film has to offer. I feel like Clint Eastwood fans would enjoy it as well as those who are fans of crime thrillers.

The pace is just right, although may be too slow for some. Don't expect crazy car chases or shootouts, just steadily building tension and good acting by a surprisingly strong cast. A few scenes are a bit silly and out of place, namely the black family's flat tire, the Hispanic guy getting pulled over, and the constant reminders that the main character is essentially the same old guy we saw in Grand Torino, although that's not necessarily a bad thing.",The Mule
217,vinsond21,A good story told exceptionally well,10,21 January 2019,"I like a movie that tells a good story, and this one does exceptionally well.
Clint Eastwood plays Earl Stone, a man somewhat estranged from his family because of his attention towards plants and friends. One day, after his business fails, he is introduced to the opportunity of making money as a drug mule. After an easy first delivery, Stone becomes hooked to the job. Soon, the cartel boss takes a liking to him because he gets the job done while drawing little suspicion because of his age, background and law-abiding ways. His minders however are frustrated that he does not always follow their orders although, ironically, some of his diversions during the delivery actually helped to delay his being apprehended by enforcement agents. Meanwhile, he also takes time out to reconnect with his family and is soon reconciled with his wife and daughter.
The cast, the writing and the music are all superb, almost flawless. Eastwood makes sure the characters are all believable and plays his own part of a stubborn old man who still manages to get our sympathy because of his well-meaning intentions. Bradley Cooper beautifully underplays his character, who is earnest in his mission but not to the point of being someone detestable.
In a movie that does not feature an excess of drama and violence, pacing becomes all-important, and this movie draws you into the life of Earl Stone by putting him in interesting situations from start to end.

220,seige-hound,"Retreads Gran Torino Ground, but Still Works on its Own.",7,5 February 2019,"Clint Eastwood directs, produces and stars in this film as Earl, a 90 year old retiree who is attempting to reconnect with his family, who all see him as a bad memory due to him prioritizing work over family. At the same time, he is offered a job by a young Mexican man in order to make money to pay for his granddaughter's wedding. Turns out, this job is as a drug mule for a Mexican cartel, driving large amounts of cocaine from state to state. While Earl is initially troubled by this, he grows addicted to the large sums of money that are left in his semi as payment, that he uses to refurbish his old veterans club, pay for his granddaughter's education and wedding reception, among other things. But as he goes deeper into the rabbit hole, the DEA notices, and begins a manhunt for this prolific drug mule, while never suspecting he would actually be a 90 year old retired white man.At times, this film feels odd, due to the way Earl acts in some scenes as a mouthpiece for Eastwood and the generation he belongs to. Earl calls black people negroes, refers to his Mexican handlers as 'you people' and mistakes a lesbian biker gang as men. In one scene, where the head of the cartel invites Earl to his villa for a party, the camera leers at several young women dancing in bikini tops. This isn't abnormal in the broader Hollywood landscape, but the age difference between Eastwood and the women he dances with and sleeps with is more than a little troubling, not to mention he is, at the same time, trying to fix his relationship with his ex-wife.I wouldn't say the film is bad at all. I quite enjoyed it despite these odd moments, that come across as a 90 year old man mumbling to himself about millenials spending too much time on their phones. It's fun in its own way, but I feel like this film retreads a lot of the same thematic ground as Eastwood's earlier work Gran Torino (I've seen some other critics here already make this comparison) about older white men's relationship with younger minorities, with a heavy focus on crime and poverty. It even ends in similar ways, with Eastwood's character sacrificing himself (albeit in Mule, he simply gets arrested and convicted, spending the rest of his life in prison, rather than being shot to death, although it did seem to be leading in that direction for a little while)Overall, this film is an entertaining drama film with plenty of good moments, a few odd moments, and a theme that seems a little worn but otherwise works with the story.",The Mule

First question I have on my mind is this: why would a 90 year old man put time and energy into a movie instead of spending as much of remaining time as possible with his family and friends? That's a legitimate question and seeing this movie with correct understanding answers it. Clint made The Mule because of not despite of his close ones. The Mule is a sort of a will in a movie format.All drug business is an allegory for what Clint has gone through over the years. Maybe he felt that he neglected his family and people important to him because of career? You don't become Clint Eastwood without a huge amount of time and effort spend on set. Maybe he wanted to say how sorry he was for it?Maybe Clint wanted say that in the end he feels as being the mule in the movie industry working for money because he's good at it and not personal fulfillment? Maybe he wanted to say that he understands mistakes he made and is willing to accept them and deal with them? Or maybe he wanted to reaffirm how he stayed true to himself over the years?I think part of the answer for why he made this movie lies in everything above. The Mule is not an ordinary movie despite looking so from distance. It deserves your attention without you knowing much about it.,The Mule
224,makleen2,Best Film of 2018?,9,18 December 2018,"When 90-year-old Earl Stone loses everything he loves, can he use ill-gotten gains to win it back before the DEA, or the cartel, takes him down?Written by Nick Schenk and directed by and starring Clint Eastwood, The Mule (2018) was inspired by a New York Times article ""The Sinaloa Cartel's 90-Year Old Drug Mule"" by Sam Dolnick. The Mule uses true events to frame a much more compelling story. Bucking the current trend of emotionally monochrome dramas, this film is a rich tapestry of triumph and tragedy, humor and sadness, and guilt and forgiveness.Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) is a successful horticulturalist in Peoria, Illinois but neglectful of his family. He finds himself estranged from his wife Mary (Dianne Wiest) and daughter Iris (Alison Eastwood), but is still admired by his granddaughter Ginny (Taissa Farmiga). Mary and he divorce, and after failing to embrace the digital age, Stone's business falls on hard times. He takes a mysterious offer to deliver a package from Mexico to Chicago. With his newfound income, he rebuilds the local VFW after a fire and helps pay for his granddaughter's cosmetology tuition. Meanwhile, he frustrates his cartel handler, Julio (Ignacio Serricchio) with his unpredictable behavior.Things get complicated when DEA agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) and his partner Trevino (Michael Peña) flip a cartel employee and he tips them off about a successful drug mule known as ""Tata"", or grandfather. The unassuming elderly white man with a clean record was able to slip under law enforcement's radar. At 90 years of age and with the DEA on his tail, Earl Stone is running out of time to reverse his fortunes and reconcile with his family.The Mule is loosely based on the life of Leo Sharp, a WW2 veteran and Detroit-based horticulturalist and daylily farmer who began working as a drug mule for the Sinaloa cartel after his business fell on hard times. His life of crime made him a millionaire. Sharp was finally caught in 2011 at the age of 87, pled guilty to drug conspiracy, and served one year in prison before being let out due to his declining health. He died in December 2016.Most of the events depicting Earl Stone's family life were not based on his historic counterpart. Sharp had a wife and three children, and was still married when he died. The filmmakers changed the years in which the events took place, and changed Sharp's home state from Michigan to Illinois. These changes, particularly when it comes to the main character's personal life, substantially improved the story and added much-needed depth, drama, and substance. The filmmakers didn't set out to tell Leo Sharp's story; they used it as a springboard to tell their own.It's difficult not to compare The Mule with Clint Eastwood's 2008 film Gran Torino. We don't see many elderly protagonists on screen anymore, and Eastwood seems to have carved a new niche for himself late in his career. Like the character of Walt Kowalski, Leo Sharp is an emotionally reserved and politically-incorrect elderly white man having a difficult time adjusting to the modern world. Both are Korean War veterans, and both experience the loss of a spouse.While Kowalski sacrifices himself to remove a threat to his community, Sharp embraces a life of crime to improve his financial situation and help others in need. Sharp is no hero, but he learns the importance of placing family before his own ambition, finds forgiveness, and rekindles his relationship with his family. The Mule's message is deeply personal, and therefore is the more emotionally impactful of the two films.The Mule opened to mostly favorable reviews from critics and audiences alike. Cynical viewers might dismiss parts of this film as overly sentimental, but you'd have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by some aspect of the story. It has a 60% rating from critics and 72% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes, and pulled in $17.5 million in its opening weekend (finishing second at the box office). With what might be his last film, 88-year-old Clint Eastwood cements his place as one of the greatest actors and directors of our time.",The Mule
225,Beachbum2018,Strangely it felt a bit disturbing.... but I don't really know why?,6,18 November 2020,"I love Clint Eastwood films whether he acts or directs, he's an icon of cinema. This was quite good, not outstanding, but it started slow, got a bit lost in the middle then ended really strong when Clint's character reunited with his family, reconnected with his daughter and especially his wife in her final days.
But, here's the thing, there was something really disturbing to me about Clint acting this role at his age. It wasn't the story or the plot, it was Clint himself, though I can't put my finger on what it was that bothers me. Maybe he's just to old to be carrying this off, it just feels weird that he's still making movies centred on his ubiquitous loner movie character persona!
I know it's been his badge over his career, starting way back with the stranger in the spaghetti westerns, then Dirty Harry followed by a mixed bunch of roles mid career and finally into his purple patch more recently starting with Unforgiven / Gran Torino (GT).
This movie could easily have been Walt's swansong ending if he hadn't been killed off in GT, the characters were basically the same, and that's maybe what bothers me a bit.... but I've no idea why it bothers me, it just does!
There's a sadness about these latter characters that is together compelling, annoying and disturbing, but that's Clint's genius, he can act and make the roles believable.
Anyway, he's still kicking it out of the park at his age and that's something to be truly celebrated!",The Mule

As a director, I think he's been solid overall, making a handful of classic films along the way. As watchable as it is, The Mule is not one of them. It could be the last big thing we see from Eastwood's career, and if so, then it's not a bad note to go out on, but it's not his best, and it doesn't have to be. He's proven himself a hundred times over, and this is the film he wanted to make. The Mule is a fine movie to watch, and Eastwood plays a very subdued character, unlike his role in Gran Torino where he still had shades of his bad boy past.

Since 'Gran Torino' that Clint Eastwood did not star in and directed, and the truth is that this film has a lot in common with 'The Mule'. We have a negative protagonist, who transports drugs for money, but that nevertheless, under the gaze and direction of Clint Eastwood, we can empathize with him in a very human way. Because this film has a very emotional approach, with a slow and classic narrative by this director that allows the viewer to connect with the character, although this is not a totally positive one.
We are facing one more Clint Eastwood film with a twilight focus, and it is that since 'Unforgiven' he has been giving this focus to his films. Although in 'The Mule' he feels really special because it is probably the last time we find him starring in a movie.

Eastwood is like Jeff Goldblum in the idea that no matter who he's playing, he still seems like the same character (even if he's supposed to be a old guy with character, an outlaw, or a cop). This is what made him famous, but you just know how he's going to act something out.
As mentioned, not a fast paced movie. Maybe your parents or grandparents would enjoy it, but I'd say it's for people over 50. Wish I had really liked it more than I did. To say it's NOT worth seeing is incorrect, but wait until it hits your TV and see it at home.",The Mule

It's a nothing, secondary role. Laurence Fishburne? Entirely wasted in a perfunctory role any B-actor could have done.Here are the problems with ""The Mule"":1) The script effing sucks.

The leader of the cartel wants to meet the mule so he flies him in to his compound in Mexico. (Really? What major cartel boss gives a crap about meeting an elderly mule? BS.)The leader of the cartel is killed halfway in the film by mutinous crew who are worried about the boss slipping. (Really? We never saw the boss slipping or making mistakes.) And when the leader is killed, no one around objects. Seriously...??The new leaders of the cartel are mean, angry and threatening, and the mule has to ""be on time"" or else. (WTF? When was this ever a problem during the film? He's their prize mule, why all the sudden concern and need to threaten the guy? Completely illogical.)The majority of the conversations Eastwood has with family members are forced, contrived, not believable. It's as if these were written by someone who's never had a family or understands relationships. The writer is not a great writer, just look at his past credits.2) The acting is mediocre. This is not the actors' fault. These are good actors. It's the fault of the director who doesn't know WTF he wants out of these actors' performances. And this shows. I would bet major bucks that Eastwood gave very little direction -- if any -- to any of the stars. Big mistake.3) This film doesn't know what it wants to be. A thriller? A drama? An action-adventure? A docu-drama? Eastwood should have made up his mind and stuck with it. This film is all over the place, is not consistent, and turns into some weird drama late in the film with his ex-wife dying. And then, after being caught by the Feds, he pleads guilty and goes to prison. The End.Talk about a whimper of an ending! This is almost as bad as the ending to the horrible movie ""Under the Silver Lake.""Clint Eastwood has lost it. Sorry folks. He should just stick to acting in these twilight years, and be happy with a number of great films he used to make. I'm done. I have no interest in watching any new Eastwood-directed movie again.",The Mule
242,ty-jensen,Good movie,8,27 December 2018,"Clint Eastwood once again directed two movies in the same year, his last movie The 15:17 To Paris was lame. The Mule is inspired by a true story, Leo Sharp, a World War 2 veteran who became a drug courier for the Sinaloa Cartel. Earl Stone is a Korean War veteran and horticulturist with money problems and he's estranged from his family.
The Mule is a good movie, it's a compelling crime drama aimed at older folks but anyone can enjoy it. It's a slow burner but it's never boring. It's not a fast paced action movie.The acting was good as expected, Eastwood is a legend. Eastwood gave another good performance but I think he gave his best performance in Gran Torino. Bradley Cooper and Michael Pena were good but subdued.
There's some humor which works, I guess many Eastwood movies have humor. In case anyone is curious about language, there isn't a lot like Gran Torino. Cursing doesn't bother me.If you like the cast, you should see The Mule. I don't think it's a hard R but I know it's not for everyone.",The Mule
243,sme3,"Typical Eastwood, Which Is a Good Thing",8,8 March 2019,"Like many of Clint Eastwood's later films, The Mule operates in morally muddy waters. It successfully makes the dubious conduct of its lead character understandable. The film proceeds at a meandering pace, but it is never boring.

244,Denno1972,Decent Eastwood movie,7,11 December 2020,"This is not Eastwood at his best nor his worst. It's a decent story with some really good moments. The premise allows Eastwood to cover similar themes to those he has explored before; regret, family estrangement, an old man out of step etc. However it's well done with moments of pathos and humour. It most probably lacks any real drama and there is little tension given the subject matter. The supporting roles are mostly under developed but is an entertaining watch all the same.",The Mule
245,thales-63045,Excellent for those over 40,9,20 August 2021,Another slow methodical film from Eastwood. Just enough pace to stop you getting bored but not fast enough to make you wonder what happened there. Eastwood does look old. My childhood hero from the 60's and 70's is an old man. Gutted. I like the way he doesn't linger as a director on the narrative. It jumps in sections because some you don't need to see. Just know that's what happened. He also seems to give actors that aren't well known (in the U. K. at least) a step on the acting ladder whilst giving some of the old timers a last hurrah. His subliminal messaging is superb. Especially the bit with the couple and child broken down on the freeway. I'm sure there was in in-joke about his impersonation of Jimmy Stewart.,The Mule

253,webwizardbe,Your typical Clint Eastwood film as a senior movie maker,6,24 March 2019,"I can be short about this movie. If you like the movies directed by Clint Eastwood the last 20 years or so you won't be disappointed. I gave it a 6 because he did better things than this, but then again, he didn't write or co-write the script, and the man is getting old. My hat off even for still squeezing a movie out that gave me an entertaining evening. Must say my pal rented it on digi-tv, so I didn't had to pay for it, and I will never do. It's just a good enough movie for filling 1 night in your life, and it's fun to see the old man acting. He's still great.The formula is light; it's a movie about an old guy who goes ""drug mule"" but coated with family drama & connections with relatives. In that sense it's more a family drama.
As always with Clint, the movie is slow paced but all kinds of little stuff happens in between with comedy & drama. So no worries, it's not one of those netflix slow burners without any content. I think netflix would break a movie like this up in a 12 part series.A good tv-movie when you prefer things a litlle bit more quiet that evening than action packed.",The Mule

258,toonyjakes,Lacks emotional and visual depth,6,20 December 2018,"The Mule is another one of those films that has all of the right ingredients, but doesnt quite nail the recipe. You have an interesting main character, a story that makes you wonder, and great actors. What you don't get, is depth.Plot- An aged florist who has been elusive to his family becomes a mule for the cartel? See we're never totally sure of who he works for, where they are located, where they send him, or how they find a snitch right off the bat, and what his role he plays in this business. Really all that happens is the main character drives and some minor close-calls occur.Writing- I will repeat this for the rest of my life; the writing makes the movie. It is the foundation. And this movie just has a cut and dry script. People have their issues and thats it, we get no further elaboration. Biggest flop was how the family interacted with the protagonist. Instead of using subtlety or maybe even a flashback scene, every time the protagonist is nesr the family, they say something about him ""never being there"" and whine.Characters/Acting- Clint still has it in him, that's for sure. Id say the acting was very well done, its just that characters themselves never come to a breaking point, or any kind of interesting point. We feel no compassion for anyone aside Clint, a man with a love for flowers and living life freely. The family of the protagonist is very annoying. All they do is bring up the past every single scene (no joke) and make him feel like crap. If you still talk to a family member who was astray, is that how you would always react? The same whiney emotion every time you see them, just to make them feel bad? Even if they want to make a change? It just made the movie look hilarious whenever they spoke.Quality- Very well shot, felt like a less intense Gran Torino, but still good. Could have used some pizzaz, any at all would have been stellar.Overall, I can recommend this movie to fans of slow, mild films. Otherwise I walked away empty handed with this one. There's a theme to it, I think Clint says it- and if that is the theme- it was very corny. Not a complete waste of time but also not a very good use of it. Just kind of left a dry taste in my throat.",The Mule

The Ego of this man is pealed off and his last movies will be the essence of what his life is about. It's nectar. And it feeds my soul.So don't mind that routine script, don't whine about the straight-forward, universal sentimentality. It's life and life always boiles down to the same thing.A young director goes places, dives and is puzzled by what he finds, obstructs and goes down and up.

Well, he is and he does. It's a decent film. It keeps things simple. The main characters are likeable. The secondary characters are fun and almost all sympathetic. There's a sad bit about his ex wife dying but he finds redemption for a lifetime of neglecting his family. The film generally remains light hearted which makes for easy watching. It's no Breaking Bad or Better Call Saul, either of which covers off the Mule aspect better than anything else for my money but for what is likely to be Eastwood's final film in front of the camera, it is largely satisfying one and goes out on a moral high note.",The Mule

I wasted $2.15 to rent the Blue Ray from Redbox & watched it with three other victims. We all agreed it was a boring waste of time. Eastwood plays a selfish stupid old man who, according to the storyline background, has always been stupid & selfish. The movie drags along with Eastwood realizing at age 90 that maybe he should have paid more attention to his family. The running of drugs was supposed to add some excitement. If watching an old fart drive a truck at the speed limit & sing along to old stale songs is exciting then I guess one would think the movie had some excitement. Some apologists can argue this movie is intended as a ""character study"". That would be fine if the Eastwood character were at all interesting. If you want to watch a character study movie watch the 1981 movie ""My Dinner With Andre"".

As per above Clint is getting on in years but can still more than play a part and command a presence, particularly in the second half of this film.The film is though let down by some mediocre sequencing/scripting/casting from others. The idea of Laurence Fishbourne sounds great but clearly his role hasn't been thought thru out so he isn't properly used.

The Mule did not dissapoint at all!The movie does get off to a bit of a slow start, but it doesn't take long for it to kick into gear and is an entertaining ride from start to finish. What surprised me the most about this movie was how funny it actually is without the humor ever feeling out of place. It actually starts out rather lighthearted for a film dealing with such subject matter and the intensity slowly builds towards a climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. Although this movie is intense, don't expect a lot of action. This is less Narcos and more of a movie about a very flawed man trying to make up for his unfulfilling life and the mistakes he's made towards his loved ones. The fact that this is based on a true story only made it more engrossing. Eastwood isn't the only performance that shines here though, the supporting cast also does an excellent job! Bradley Cooper, Andy Garcia, and Michael Pena in particular stood out. And without spoiling anything, the ending was surprisngly emotional and had me on the verge of tears.While I don't think this is quite as good as some of Eastwood's greatest, it's still a great movie that will please both his fans and anyone looking for a good crime drama.

282,grantbullert,A Severe Disappointment,6,23 January 2019,"""The Mule"" is a bad film. It's that simple. I love Clint Eastwood as much as the next guy, but you can't make a good movie from a bad script.-Analysis of Notable Work- *Writing/Directing: The script is abysmal. Not much else to say. We have no reason to root for Earl besides the fact that he is played by Clint. That's not good enough. Lazy writing is to blame here. Eastwood's direction is fine, but a turd is a turd whether you polish it or not. *Cinematography/Editing: Fine work here. Nothing special, but nothing too complain about. Maybe the color grading could have been a bit better. *Dialogue/Acting: The story structure is awful, and the dialogue is decent, but it has a few incredibly cringey moments. The supporting actors and extras are quite awful, but Eastwood, Peña, Cooper, Fishburne, and Garcia all do the best with what they are given. Dianne Wiest does not play up to par in this film. *Music/Sound: Average work here. *Production Design/Special Effects: Sets and costumes are fine. Make-up is the best of this department.*Conclusion: ""The Mule"" is an incredibly bland and poorly written film, which is really a shame. It has a great cast and director. But everything is so out of place. The pacing is terrible, the cartel behaves like middle-school boys, and there are a ton of out-of-touch jokes. The biggest issue is that Earl is not a redeemable character. His ""redemption"" is super weak and not compelling.

284,ahicks-2,Eastwood delivers a masterpiece in his rare but great self-loathing mode,9,17 December 2018,"Eastwood in the movies closest to his own cinematic persona that are in his confessional, Yes-I-am-an-Ass**** (HEARTBREAK RIDGE, A PERFECT WORLD) mode as opposed to his more affirmative (Harry Callahan, gunslinger) mode de!ivers some of his deepest and most moving work. This film is best where the self-disgust is manifest, best of all in the great A PERFECT WORLD where the self loathing is most explicit and unqualified -- for example as expressed by the character's response to a police underling's misconceived praise for Eastwood killing his prey: ""I don't know a damn thing."" But MULE (read ""Ass?"") is a comparably rich work, though less uncompromising as it allows the Eastwood character to settle into self acceptance after much repudiation of his amoral, narcissistic , socially insensitive, gun-friendly, celebrity-seeking sexist (and broadly ""politically incorrect"") self-absorbed self. Of course, Eastwood has made great films in the less manifestly personal --almost skilled-hack--mode (MYSTIC RIVER, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA).

287,Critomaton,Clint Eastwood rides off into the sunset in this slow burn that never really ignites,5,16 December 2018,"Watch the trailers or commercials for The Mule. They seem to show lots of setups for interesting ""how's he gonna get out of that one?"" scenarios. The trouble is, Clint barely gets into any of these jams, let alone has any trouble getting out of them.The movie is consequence-free for most of the characters. We're introduced to three varieties of cartel drug dealers: the friendly, automatic rifle-toting garage gang; the stern, by-the-book right-hand man who starts off cold as ice but eventually warms to Clint's folksy style, and the straight up gangsta thug stone cold killas (who also, it would seem, warm up to Clint by the end because they only rough him up when they were under orders to whack him).Multiple key plot elements defy logic and belief:First, that they would not switch vehicles once they knew the DEA was looking for a black pickup.Second, that they would let Clint out of their sight when they were so determined to make sure he didn't deviate from the scheduled route.Third, that once they had found Clint again they would let him continue unescorted on his way.It doesn't help much to read in the end credits that this was based on a true story.Not much more to say here. I realize the moral was about not putting family second to anything, but there was probably a more important moral to be made about, oh I don't know, the consequences of running cocaine for a murderous cartel. But that never materialized.Most episodes of Breaking Bad handle both of these issues better than The Mule does, and none do it more boringly (except for maybe, the ""Fly"" episode).",The Mule

294,Rollum,More dead horse than Mule,1,1 November 2019,"The Mule started out well enough, the story - Earl Stone (Clint Eastwood) neglected his now estranged wife and daughter to pursue his passion for cultivating Day Lilies. Now Earl is a cash strapped old man who's flower growing business is now bust because of internet shopping. While making a precarious attendance to a family occasion, Earl is approached by a man who tell him he can earn money driving and gives him a number to call resulting in Earl making multiple drug runs for a Drug Cartel.That was about it, what followed was cliché cop scenes, a handful of DEA cops bumbling around trying to make their mark and crack a big case. The cartel where a gang of intellectually challenged cry-babies, waiving their guns, threatening to kill Earl if he messed up. Eventually the dissident Cartel members kill the nice boss and he is replaced by a nasty boss who insists Earl does as he is told, which Earl had been doing anyway and made 13 successful drug runs.So now the Cartel insist that the Mule aka Earl needs a Keeper. Why would you hire a mule to cart drugs and then follow them in another car? Isn't the point of having a mule to distance yourself from the crime? And then Earl (Clint) buys himself a big black truck and just has the drugs in the back, no problem. Even when there are bags of drugs right in front of an angry Cop, Earl is such a smooth talker the Cop doesn't notice them. Very silly.Laurence Fishburne was the ""Special"" agent in charge. His scenes were all the same. Initially he says no to Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) requests for resources to catch the mule, then he reflects, changes his mind and says ""Get it done"". I counted 4 times the same vapid scene.I have never seen Bradley Cooper so passive in a movie, so without appeal, as if he was about to look at his watch and say, i gotta be somewhere else sorry.
There was a snitch of course, who supplied Agent Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) with the Cartels drug transport manifest showing where, when and how drug shipments where happening. What did the DEA do with it? Nothing, they just started pulling over any black trucks they saw! all while listening to the cartels phone calls, letting all the other mules go about their business.Then there was the scene of Earl Stone's (Clint Eatwood) wife, Mary (Dianna Weist) dying. The scene was contrived and trying to be poignant, it wasn't though. Some wheezing, some small talk and it was over. And finally, the big trial, where Earl interrupts the proceeding and pleads guilty, the judge sends him immediately to federal prison, Earls estranged family all love him now and promise to visit him in jail, and we close with Earl doing what he loves, growing flowers in his prison jump suit.
Given Clint Eastwood won't be around much longer, I sincerely hope he gets to make another movie and this is not his last one. It was great to see Clint again, but this movie is a schlock. All in all, the Mule was more like a dead horse.",The Mule

The cast is good and the melodic jazz synonymous with Clint flicks a delight to sit through. Ending was a little disappointing- I would've liked to see the DEA go after the cartels and wrap up the movie but that's just idealistic.

As others have pointed out, it's nothing more than an ego trip for a tired and fading old actor who can't get over the fact that he's no longer the hottest name on the block. Terrible script. One-dimensional, stereotyped characterisation.

His team of cops and agents breaks several law enforcement rules of thumb. Anyone who watches police shows like LIVE PD knows how protocol works and that was not it.

305,alvesmarceloalves-73751,The return of the old Clint,7,3 February 2019,"In his later works, Clint Eastwood had been focusing on unlikely heroes and tracing an almost memorial in a way that the American sold himself into the world. That figure that in the most improbable moments will save the motherland and will prove a great name for history, even if it presents its problems. ""Sully"" (2016) is somehow that way. Similarly, ""15:17: train to Paris"" (2018). And even the ""American Sniper"" (2014) appealed to this narrative.By chance or not, these are among some of their weaker jobs. Obvious narratives, few conflicts and even the absence of a story that really deserved a movie to tell it. ""Sully"" had content for at most one short film.""The Mule"", however, is a return of Clint to his good times. The real story of a nonagenarian gentleman who has seen a mule from the Sinaloa traffic in Mexico, carrying drugs unnoticed on the American roads is a full plate for Eastwood's work not only as a director but also as an actor.Earl Stone is that anti-hero who usually does good movies. Terrible father, poor husband, poor grandmother, Earl devoted his whole life to flowers. Without realizing it, however, he failed to pay attention to the three women in his life and he lost one by one. The daughter, the wife, and almost the granddaughter, who turns out to be the chance of redemption for him when he realizes that he dedicated his whole life to the work driving the country roads, but never gave the family the deserved attention.It is precisely when he sees his life and his business crumble by the arrival of the Internet that Earl ends up falling into the hands of the traffic. The aim of the cartel is to make mules circulate around the United States carrying drugs without stopping by police officers. It's Earl's an exemplary talent. In all his life, he never took a ticket.As he begins his journey through the underworld of crime, Earl also relishes a little of the life he has left so far behind. As he earns money, he recovers some of his lost history through a series of factors: the house from which he was dumped, the Korean War veterans' club, his family's important dates, even though he suffers a lot of resistance.Earl just wants to recover the time. Just what he can never have or buy, for he is at the end of his life.It's almost impossible to cheer against Earl, even though we know he's doing something wrong. Clint Eastwood builds an aura of sympathy for that frail gentleman who ventures the roads while seeking a meaning for life, but more than that, redemption. Earl wants his family back, something that hurts him deeply, to the point of rightly advising his executioner, Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper) to remember that special dates, birthdays and family are important.""The Mule"" may not be Eastwood's most brilliant film, but it's a work that deserves to be appreciated for the journey your character has made. It does not bring great reflections, but it is possible to find beauty in Earl's quest for redemption.",The Mule
306,cbak223,Beginning of the End,7,22 April 2019,"Well we are aware of certain Hollywood elite, their presence on screen has given us certain chills and emotions that we cant explain, I'm sure if there were a banner in a grand theatre hung high Clint Eastwoods name would be etched in gold. Clint Eastwood Hollywood Icon, actor, director, producer, composer, the man has done it all. We are all familiar with his acting from early on as iconic characters such as Harry Callahan, Frank Morris in escape from Alcatraz, his leadership as a director in Bridges in Madison County, Mystic River, and American Sniper, to which he worked with again Bradley Cooper who portrays a special agent in Eastwood's next Directed pick, The Mule. the Mule is a story about a drug smuggler who breaks the record for the cartel of most kilos travelled across state lines. Earl Stone(Clint Eastwood) is an aging horticulturist that has a booming business, thriving in his small town amongst friends and neighbors, you soon learn the hard work he has dedicated to his business he has done the opposite and neglected his family. after the tide turns on his business he is forced out due to foreclosure and is back on the road, he attends his grand daughters wedding reception and is met with distain. As he begins to leave a young man approaches him with an opportunity, an opportunity that will change his fate forever. all he has to do is drive, having been asessoned drive all his life he has no problem with this and soon begins to make his trips, deliver the package to the desired location, no questions asked. He starts to see the fruit of his labor paying off in bigger and bigger stacks of cash, thus being able to help his grand daughter for her wedding, being able to stop the foreclosure on his property, even help out his local bar when the kitchen burns up he donates to fix it back up. Of coarse what goes up, always comes down, Agent Colin Bates( Bradley Cooper) is assigned the case to find and bust the man simply known as tata. The film is written off of a New York Times article that titles "" The Sinaloa Cartel's 90 Year Old Drug Mule"" written by Nick Schenk. The film is in my opinion one of Clint's best, the character was aloof enough to be believed he had no idea what he was being used for, until it was too late. I wish it had a better ending, you grew to love the character by the end and why he was doing it, for his family which in the end the money didn't matter, Sam Dolnick wrote the screenplay for The Mule, and surprising enough a first time screenwriter.

The story of a 90-year old coerced by the Mexican drugs cartel to simply drive larger and larger bundles of drugs is engaging and beautifully acted. There is a superb supporting cast - I didn't even recognise Dianne Weist at first, but it was obvious she was a superb actress from the outset, and her later scenes with Clint Eastwood were just wonderful. I think ""Only a 99-year old wants to be 100"" is now among my favourite throwaway lines said on film by Clint Eastwood.

Which is something you may never expect from Clint Eastwood's characters. A gardening-loving 78-year old Earl, has problems delivering promises, unless they're work related. A loved by all and respected man in his working community who wins prizes annually for his precise work with flowers, has troubles managing is work-life and family-life. He's rigid and not flexible when change comes.Flash-forward to 12 years later in 2017, when he's 90 years old, he's lost the somewhat acquired prosper of gardening life to technology. Now, here's the no-smile Clint we all know and appreciate.
Being proud of his clean record, and out of sheer hopelessness of any prosper in his job, he starts to work for the drug Cartel, quite randomly.The Character, Earl, is very well-written. Clint has done such a good job bringing him to life that one might say he didn't have a hard job. He had been an important man, then he's lost the respect and social place. He's never had a strong relationship with the family. So, when Cartel gives him a lot of money and a thank you party, he feels respected again. So, at some point it's not just about the money for him. The trial scene explains a lot. He's seen things, he's tired and he just wants to go back to his gardening. ""The Heat"" scene was also quite cool. Maybe, I didn't have enough focus to enjoy this movie 100%, but whose fault is that, right?Loved the music in this movie, quite fit. All the other characters in the movie are quite tangible, yet the acting is not adequate. Clint is fine, everyone else is below that. And, the wife is just disappointing.
So, story is based on something real, landscapes are good. Nothing really special about this movie. The story line moves very slowly; although, simultaneously quite fast! A lot of things happen in a very slow motion.",The Mule

The story appears simple: a 90-year-old man serves as a drug mole for the Mexican Drug Cartel. But as we all know, the real story is in the details and that's where Eastwood's craft shines. Issues of family separation, lost career, and maneuvering through the harsh realities of the underworld drug trade provide viewers with the winding road of a mule. The major cast members - Alison Eastwood, Dianne Weist ,Taissa Farmiga, Michael Pena, Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia - serve as major family, drug cartel and DEA functionary characters, with Bradley Cooper portrays the second male lead with quiet efficiency. The remaining cast appears as almost faceless characters conducting tedious details of life, work and drug world enforcement.

To fulfill the promise of taking care of wedding expenses the man takes a job that earns him quick cash not knowing what the job could lead to.

347,kmcmac,Another good Eastwood movie,7,5 June 2019,"Like his other directed movies well made and in a sense a simple story, however this tale delves as much into the character's motivations, family and personal characteristics. You never really feel for him as a hero or a villan but as someone who falls into crime as much due to the circumstances, opportunity and the characters own suitability traits. Throughout there are glimpses of a person that touch on selfishness, irresponsibility, womanising, likely infidelity, all traits of an narcissistic impulsive personality suited to crime who has had little concern, past and present for the consequences of his actions on others whether family or the public. That said on the other side of the coin is the same creative individual who at the end of his life has realised his failures to those closest to him and has little left to lose being a mule.",The Mule

It looks as though he threw together ideas and sprinkled it with something involving a 90 yr. old, from another story that was handed to him after a stranger read an article. It's THAT boring and unemotional.This is nothing but glorifying a drug runner and trying to make you feel sorry for him. Halfway through the movie I'm hoping for him and his drug-cartel buddies to all get killed.The best moment in this movie is the court room scene. After he's been sentenced, his daughter says to his grand-daughter, ""Well at least we'll now know where he's at.""

Because the 92 year old Mr. Sharp is now dead and buried, the 87 year old Eastwood (who was drafted into the army and whose REAL Korean war record was as a swimming instructor in California who didn't even have to leave his home state), is free to change his name and use his story to inject his own agenda of a self serving, mythical, 87 year old deadbeat dad, who is full of smiling racial digs and the subtle hate baiting and that reveals the true Eastwood for the pig he really is...",The Mule

359,marcocano-35090,Good movie and surprisingly funny!,7,17 March 2019,"The movie has the traditional Eastwood feeling to it throughout the whole movie. It's a good movie but not one of his best.
First the negative. At times the pace is a little bit dragging. There are times also by not fleshing out enough the supporting characters that it becomes difficult to really buy into the different problems the main characters encounters in his life . There are not enough moments to tell us that he really is in pain regarding his family or the life he had. Also there is an issue with some plot holes or decisions taken by certain characters who appear too drastical.
On the positive note the humour is great, the main character is very likeable and very human. He's presented with a lot of flaws and also you get that he has seen a lot of things throughout life. I also really liked the different relationships he just makes with absolut naturality regarding people who you would not think that you could come to like them because of what they do. Also there is a interesting approach through Eastwoods character and Coopers character concerning the difficulty of separating a good and evil when the evil is maybe not evil but just is put under an evil situation.
If you want to watch a movie with a complexe main character , about life , difficult to imagine and growing relationships who become impossible, see a less obvious separation of good and evil and have a good time then this is your movie.",The Mule

A good for ""old souls"" like me. My only real regret is the setting being almost completely shot in Georgia when the route is from El Paso, Texas to Illinois and nowhere else.

I missed my opportunity to see it in theatres and had been patiently waiting for a Netflix release. Yesterday the wait came to an end and I wish I could say that the patience involved was rewarded. I love Clint Eastwood movies, but this movie is highly unrealistic and out of touch.A racist war veteran ""unknowingly"" gets mixed up in trafficking for a Mexican drug cartel. This veteran has been a POS father and husband his whole life. He does not start trafficking to better their lives, instead he does it so he can invest in more of his own selfish interests. A lackluster pursuit eventually entails between the old guy in a truck and the DEA. After amassing enough wealth to cover any and all conceivable expenses, he continues trafficking for the cartel anyways. Eventually the pursuit comes to a close in an uneventful way.You cant help but wonder what the AFTERMATH would have been like if the movie went on another 30 minutes. The ending has almost no significance because quite frankly ""Earl"" (aka Clint) is living in a non-existent fantasy cartel land where the gang members are actually super friendly and generous. DEA agents too. Go figure.",The Mule

375,KatoC,"Great movie, horribly lame ending.",7,27 March 2019,"Since i.m.o. this is a classic parable kind of story (with his mule experience being allegorical for an entire life, not necessarily his), it could easily have ended with some sort of a bang. Like, after the phone call he receives from his niece on his ex-wifes stage, he could have hidden the load, and later would have went on to pick it up from the hiding place, but got intercepted by the cops, who than would have had no case against him. He could have made his last delivery in the later course and then had made a deal with the police, leading them to the bad guys. Instead, Eastwood decides it is time to walk the crime-doesn't-pay-high road in a very abrupt and swift right turn, only to put an Porsche-breaks-like full stop to what could have ended rather happily, or at least with a smile. Aside from this, I found the movie very entertaining. Some unfortunate amateur acting mishaps, but totally neglect-able.",The Mule
376,stellaarwennicolina,Not Gran Torino - but worth a watch,7,7 February 2019,"The Mule might be not the best movie Clint ever made, but it surely is a pretty good one. I enjoyed his acting so much and the story was really different from other movies. Of course you can't compare it with ""Gran Torino"" but I think it was a good come back for Clint as an actor.You know what I think is really interesting? The reviews are so different that it's hardly to say if some of the guys watched the same movie. In my opinion ""The Mule"" is a movie that makes you think. I felt very melancholic after I watched it and I was surprised of Clint's role. I was used to see him playing tough guys without sense for humor, like in ""Unforgiven"", ""Gran Torino"", or ""Pale Rider"", so it was new for me to see him in a role like that.
I can understand all those who say this movie wasn't good, for it's a slowly told story with a difficult plot-line and not everybody likes that. For me it was just the right thing. I especially liked the scenes in the car, in which Clint sings with the radio. (I was surprised his voice still sounds that good, despite his high age)To refer to some of the other comments... I have nothing against you and your opinion but please try not to offend anyone. I don't think it's necessary to say ""all the other reviews are fake"", and ""this movie is hot garbage"". That's just not true, and even if you think so, you don't have to say it like that!And yes, there were some pretty awkward scenes in that movie and even I, and I'm just about the hugest Clint Eastwood Fan there is, felt quite uncomfortable at some points.My rating: 7 out of 10!",The Mule

Interesting that it is based on a true story.

It is as if he is the voice of America and so he has to make sure no one is offended, but it is one of those completely cinematic experiences - the old dog is as chill as it gets, and he is playing a 90-year-old. If Crocodile Dundee hadn't got the facelift, read a few books an added to his jazz collection, yes he could have been the Clint Eastwood from down-under but he hasn't and won't be. Another item to ponder on, this movie is so very cinematic and the only guns ever fired were the Mexican cartel bosses grouse shooting exploits.

But what you can expect is a very well narrated movie that develops at a steady pace along with great cinematography.In a very binary point of view, it's a very plain movie and you've probably seen it all. But delving deeper, and there's so much to unearth.
From various long lasting rifts with family, to facing moral dilemmas in life or death situations, The Mule had my attention all along.It's a great balance of intense, emotion, drama and comedic moments.

Brave.. because of how well Mr Eastwood aged and acted wobbly and out of step with the world. Really appreciated the unfolding of the story... one with a good message of what the most important things in life are especially as you get older and realize there aren't a lot of do-overs. Cooper had a smaller role than usual but my guess was a chance to work with Mr Eastwood. Weist as always is a gem. some funny and very moving moments. Exceptional casting all around and good production values. Glad it didn't get gruesome. It really had a unique take on a story told thru the ages.. not only that ""money can't buy you love,"" but that it can't buy you time either. I hope it draws a young audience since there is more time to set priorities when you're younger. Not fast paced, but just enough movement and changed to keep my interest. Well scripted too.",The Mule
394,kdcndw,Get Of My Lawn,6,31 December 2018,"So some spoilers ahead. The movie is based on some fact. And I do believe some creative license was taken. However, this movie started out as The ""Get Off My Lawn"" movie. Lots of commentary on how the older way of doing things might have been better, cell phones are terrible, the internet is terrible. On the positive side, a theme of the importance of dedication to one's family and not just get caught up in the cycle of working to provide for one's family without any emotional investments does resonate well in the movie. Scenes involving grief are overacted but handled modestly well.The Mule has a line of dialogue between two characters that summarizes much in the movie. One character comments how another character has lost his filter. The main character says, ""I never had one"". Not to surprising being that this is a Clint Eastwood movie that he has acted and directed in in his 90s, that in itself is a pretty amazing feat. However, it does demonstrate the point that the distance between Baby Boomers and Millennials is the size of the grand canyon. And I would be remiss to say he handled these themes more successfully in Grand Torino.The Mule is a mess. First off, this movie is racially tone death and pretty damn sexists which Eastwood appears to relish rubbing in people's faces showing the absurdity of PC culture. However, a scene with the bad guys at a restaurant and another scene where the lead character helps some stranded motorists really pushed it for me as far as racist overtones. And all the women characters are extremely underwritten. The cartel types are so horribly cliched it's almost comical. And lastly the story struggles with the theme of money is bad...but then money is good..because it can bring a family together and then money is bad.But somehow the movie barely works due to the themes and some of the acting. but it's a long haul and I felt the time. Pacing is pretty terrible. The last act does salvage the movie that up to that point has some crazy plot holes and major lapses of logic. This is lower to middle tier Eastwood.Competently directly although some shots made no sense. And for a thriller, it lacked a lot of thrills and some of the driving scenes came across like a glorified truck commercial. Eastwood eventually drives a nice truck in the picture and this truck is shot from every angle possible. Maybe the truck is the real star of the movie?",The Mule

396,raquel_pompey,IT WAS JUST OK... Crickets...,3,31 March 2019,Ok Pretty much this movie is about a man who squanders all his money and loses everything. He had alot of money. And in the midst of making money he was separated from his family because he was just too busy splurging having fun with friends and of course making money. So he loses all the money he has. The movie doesn't explain how it was lost. and he pretty much starts moving drugs for a cartel. Eventually they get busted he goes to jail and the movie goes off... that's literally it. Of course Clint Eastwood's performance was good but other than that everything else was below average to me,The Mule

399,paudman,Nicely done... but...,8,10 November 2021,"An excellently made movie; well shot, the acting is excellent and Clint's character is the type of elderly gentleman we can all relate to. Forgetful, apt to wander, he concentrates on the more important 'here and now' rather than tomorrow. Falling on hard times, Clint and his battered old truck do what they must to make both ends meet, and in their own way, outwitting the law through a casual, wandery, absent-minded set of escapes that are more luck than judgement. Sadly however, this is where the movie loses its' way for me. Clint makes a drug run to pay off debts. Then he pays off other people's debts. Then he sells his faithful old truck and buys a modern monster, becoming just another criminal smuggling drugs. Make him a latter-day Robin Hood if you want, but you can't forget what he's actually doing. Had the ending seen him escape his fate through another series of elderly, absent-minded, doddery, accidental getaways it could have been brilliant, but no, he just gets caught and goes to jail. Couldn't Hollywood have deviated from the truth, just once? Sadly, no. So: this is the story of a man who smuggled drugs for money and got caught. It had real potential but ended up as a very entertaining non-event. Interesting, entertaining, but ultimately: just something that happened.",The Mule

403,seedoeatreview,This Mule has quite a kick!,9,8 February 2019,"It's amazing that at almost 90 years of age Clint Eastwood is still directing, producing and acting in films. While most people of that age are taking a well deserved break, Eastwood is still busy producing high calibre work that has seen audiences flocking to cinemas to see his latest release The Mule. Add to that the amazing cast that want to work with him. From the likes of Bradley Cooper (A Star Is Born), Laurence Fishburne (Mystic River), Michael Pena (Ant-Man), Taissa Farmiga (The Nun), Diane Weist (The Birdcage) and Andy Garcia (Ocean's 11) the list of famous names in this movie is astonishing. And while most of them take a back seat to Eastwood's portrayal of drug mule Earl Stone, their small but vital roles play a part in telling a wonderful story.The film starts in the year 2005 where we find Earl Stone running a successful flower business, travelling to all parts of America selling his wares. He scoffs at people selling flowers on the emerging internet market and always puts his work before his family, even skipping his daughter's wedding so he can attend an awards ceremony in his honour. He is an attention-seeker: any chance he can get the spotlight on himself he takes it.
Fast forward 13 years later and we find the internet has destroyed Earl's business and he is estranged from his family. The years of stubbornness and neglect have caught up with Earl and have left him broke and homeless. Through a chance encounter he finds a job running drugs from Texas to Chicago for a Mexican drug cartel. Discovering that he is good at his job, as well as receiving positive attention from the cartel which he has always craved, Earl's drug running becomes even more daring as he begins taking larger shipments across state lines. But with the DEA closing in, a health crisis in his own family and a change in cartel leadership all coming to a head at once, a gripping conclusion awaits that will turn Earl's world around and change his way of thinking.THE GOOD
Even being the oldest member of the cast Clint Eastwood still steals the show. Portraying Earl as a spritely, quick witted and no nonsense 90 year old he manages to get the audience to have empathy for his character even though he was a terrible father who is doing a terrible deed. His character seems very much like the one he played in Gran Torino. Tell it like it is, racist and not caring about anyone but himself. With the same script writer working on both of those films (Nick Schenk) I'm guessing that's where the similarity comes from.
I also love that a top star in Bradley Cooper basically takes a backseat in his role of DEA agent Colin Bates in his performance. It's a classic case of less is more, and his scenes with Eastwood in a cafe evoke memories of the film Heat when Pacino and De Niro come together and discuss life from their perspectives. Alison Eastwood does her best trying to portray Iris, the daughter of Earl (that's a joke... as Alison is the daughter of Clint!). The one actor I'm really enjoying the rise and rise of is Taissa Farmiga. I wrote about her wonderful performance in my review of The Nun recently and although she plays a minor part in this film it's still strong enough to get the audience's attention. Seemingly oblivious to what is going on in her family she takes a stand when needed and brings some heart to a wonderful story.THE BADThis film is said to be 'inspired by a true story'. I know I've written about this before but it's such a cop out. Whether it's 'based on a true story' or 'inspired by true events' the writer and directors always take the liberty of turning the story into what works for them and not on what really happened. Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example of how a director told events in order to gain sympathy even though it wasn't factually correct. With The Mule Eastwood has kept the bare bones of the real story while adding other elements to the plot to add layers and generate a reaction. I can completely understand why studios use the 'based on' or 'inspired by' taglines because it adds credibility to the story and gives the marketing team something to work with. But I get frustrated when the director tries to pull the wool over our eyes by showing that Earl did not know he was running drugs for the cartel until his fourth run. That just borders on ridiculous.
It also caught my attention that although the movie runs for nearly two hours it seemed to come to a very hurried conclusion. The storyline between Earl and his friend Julio just disappeared without a trace. One minute they were having a serious discussion about getting out of the drug business and then Julio's character just seemingly vanished. A scene where the cartel captures Earl and then lets him go seemed straight forward but then Earl is shown driving with blood all over his face. It's as if scenes were cut and storylines shortened which left me rather confused as to what The Mule's ending was supposed to be.THE UGLY
You can tell that Clint Eastwood, at 90 years old, is the director of a film when he puts himself in not one but two scenes involving a ménage a trois with two twenty something year old ladies. Highly unnecessary and adding nothing to the story really. It garnered a few laughs in the cinema but I think that was more embarrassment from what was being seen on the screen.Chalk this one up as another highly entertaining Clint Eastwood film that he has either acted in or directed. I'm not sure how many more we are going to get but you can always count to them to be highly entertaining, at times very funny and beneath the surface delivering a message about an important issue in today's world. At its heart The Mule is about family and as we go on this journey with Earl we discover that sometimes what you need in life has always been in front of you the whole time.NINE KILOS OUT OF KILOSseedoeatreview.com",The Mule

I would have also liked to have seen characters that were more fleshed out, like Bradley Cooper's or The Handler. The ending seemed rushed, and I felt like the family forgave him too easily.

This film is far more than drug cartels eluding the police and cops chasing them. Yes, it has criminals galor and lots of police, but interpersonal relationships give this movie a deeper and more meaningful association with reality than I imagined. Of course, Mr. Eastwood excelled in front of and behind the camera. As the director, he got the best out the supporting cast, and they were great.

410,getadisasterkit,classic modern clint eastwood,8,15 December 2018,"Saw The Mule today. First show of the first day with the Mom who appreciates seeing movies made by her generation. I will give this a solid 8.5 out of 10. First off, its nice to see an older actor playing (and producing and directing of course) an older person from (their own) generation and era. No Hollywood play ups (with PC actors acting parts that would have never been filled by someone other than who it would have been in real life!) or PC. If you liked Gran Torino, you will like this one too. Written about a World War 2 gen and his life as a Drug Mule in the Modern World. Young people who are not familiar with this generation, because they are so far removed from it, probably will not understand the sociology of the greatest generation. This would be their great great grand fathers. So probably good idea to (have them) watch movies about this generation before seeing this one. Like I said, youngsters are too far removed to understand the way of the older generation. What makes this movie good is based on a true story, with some human events sprinkled through to add texture and dimension to the character. Older folks will appreciate seeing someone their own age, doing something daring, and illegal, rather than watching some youngster. Good adult entertainment and examination of society and what folks will do if they are driven to do something or given the chance to do something they would have never done, read the NY times article on the guy this is based on.

413,campos-8,Old Clint Still Has the Fire,8,12 March 2019,"The Mule, produced and directed by Clint Eastwood is a beautiful drama based on a New York Times report about the use of the elderly as ""mules"" by drug cartels.Backed by a cast of great actors, Clint Eastwood reaches the age of 89 still capable of a tour de force as this story impressive, dramatic and full of issues to be reflected.Winner of 4 Oscars and 3 Golden Globes, Clint Eastwood entered his name among the biggest in Hollywood, from the westerns of Sergio Leone to the great works like THE UNFORGIVEN and MILLION DOLLAR BABY, of his own.Bradley Cooper, Dianne Wiest, Laurence Fishburne, Taissa Farmiga, Michael Peña and Andy Garcia are the leading names in the superb cast that takes the story of the ninety-year-old who takes a turn in life by working as a ""mule"" for a drug cartel.But the film brings much more than this, as a beautiful and deep reflection on family relationships, guilt, responsibility about our own mistakes and so on. It's a lot of relevance to be reflected after the movie is over.Of course, in a career full of masterpieces such as Clint Eastwood (we're not even talking about MYSTIC RIVER, BIRD or PALE RIDER, this THE MULE is far from entering the top shelf.But the persona, the category, the intelligence and the differentiated sensibility of the filmmaker guarantee that even a smaller film of his is very worthy of being watched and tanned to the extreme.Old Clint still has a lot of movies to excite us.",The Mule

I say that I could care less about Clint's politics & if I were looking for an exciting, action packed movie, I would not have chosen to see this movie as it was clearly not going to be thrilling & nonstop action. The Mule is a slow paced entertaining drama about a man who has made choices in his life that put his family second & his regrets as he has aged. The drug cartel aspect of this movie was, to me, more of a sidebar of the real story; a man's search for personal redemption & a second chance.

436,MirkoS,Eastwood's weakest film,3,19 August 2019,"So yeah.....I hope you're not bowing out with this one, Clint.It follows the story of Earl, a 90-something year old Korean War veteran (what is it with Eastwood wanting to play them?) horticulturist who, due to the advent of the Internet which has affected his business prospects and hence financial situation, faces foreclosure. He's apparently estranged from his family due to his neglectful past (again, a recurrent theme in his movies) and happens upon an opportunity to make some easy money moving cargo. This will benefit him on two fronts. Why not?Curiously, walking into a garage filled with heavily tattooed, intimidating looking Hispanics (one of whom is holding an assault rifle), being advised not to look at what he's hauling, as well as dismissing their recommendation to stow it in a hidden compartment AND receiving a huge bankroll of benjies at the destination doesn't seem to raise his eyebrow in the slightest. It is only after his third (fourth?) trip and what I'd assume is a tidy little sum of 30-50+k profit that he decides to stop obliviously whistling to his music while driving, pulls over, and takes a peek at his cargo.Shock of the century there, Earl.Now I don't know what extreme old age is like, but generally, if you're bringing in thousands of dollars in a single trip, you ain't delivering Twinkies. So Earl begins muling, enjoying the newfound lifestyle it affords. The old guy still loves the ladies! Yet perhaps he's senile, because aside apparently being utterly clueless about his chosen career path that's raking in an hourly rate every neurosurgeon on the planet would kill for, Earl seems to really pay no concern that those he's working for are brutal killers and is quite cavalier and liberal in his antics, to their chagrin, but no worries....Earl's a pal with the head cartel honcho, let him stop and enjoy his sandwich. Best in the state!If ""The Mule"" is supposed to be a film about highlighting one's priorities in life, the writing, acting and dialogue fails this goal. Many of the scenes feel incredibly forced, contrived and unearned. I didn't end up caring one iota for the daughter that hated him, his granddaughter or ex-wife. They came off as one-dimensional and who only existed to make a single point or fill a role, not fully fledged people with genuine motivations and emotions. I was literally laughing at his ex-wife's funeral because it felt so artificial, not to mention her attempt to act ill, which came on incredibly quickly and was over before it even began. The familial dynamics are not present or characters nearly well developed enough to justify and validate the effect his work has on him or them. Nor are the cartel believable. After Earl's many day absence due to him choosing to finally be at his wife's side with only a measly $12 million of blow in his trunk, the cartel freaking as his location is unknown and he's not answering the phone, when they catch up to him, what do they do? Put a bullet through his head? Nope, one of the members calls his boss and attempts to argue for Earl's life. The reason?""It was his ****ing wife!""I'm sure real cartel members get a howl out of this one.Is this film supposed to be a comedy? If the filmmakers actually expect me to believe that Earl's going to be living the rest of his day's tendering the penitentiary's garden and not be gutted like a fish by the cartel in prison on his first day for blowing the delivery of $12 million dollars worth of snow....it must be.Avoid.",The Mule

The inept FBI has tons of tech that works for a plot device one minute then is forgetten the next. Everyone becomes a suspect, pulled over by police copters that hover 20' away from suspect's cars, unnoticed. The law is hot on the trail of a huge cartel, but instead of embracing Clint's inside info, they charge, convict and sentence him in a pathetic ending that must have jumped months ahead. The drug kingpins are forgotten by the FBI and plot. Lastly, let's not forget Clint's nod to aging: hatred of tech, family closure, and a 3some with hookers, and another 3some with hookers.

The interaction with the bikers was stupid and pointless. The way the agent acted when arresting him and his daughters stupid joke at the trial just werent realistic and were awful. The main problem with the whole mess that i didnt realize until later is that Clint is trying to play a bumbling old carefree dude. Thats just not him.

Why he deliberately insults them? Why was this scene even in the movie? What was the point? It was completetly out of context.Another stupid scene that was milked for much too long was where the agents stop this one truck driver who is now constantly babbling how these are statistically the most dangerous 5 minutes of his life.The scene with the ""Dykes on Bikes"" was also completety superfluous and added nothing to advance the story or the characters.

The reasons he has for doing what he does is are so have baked and are everchanging and almost makes it hard to follow. Him being a Horticulturist has nothing to do woth theme or relates in no way with what the movie is about. Bradley Cooper is an amazing actor but he just kinda showed up in this one, he gave me nothing of value in his appearance in this movie. It was so poorly edited, there was no balance between the Cops going after him and Clint Eastwood driving. A few scenes of gratuitous softcore porn circled around Eastwood just made me feel uncomfortable.

Is that bad? Well, kinda. I love Clint, and I'm well aware that he is a master at putting these films together to where they move quickly, waste no camera time on anything meaningless, and tell a darn good emotional story. But something doesn't really work here, and I'm not a good enough critic, or writer, to say exactly why. The film just gets out of the box too fast, and then spends those first several minutes moving from scene to scene, setting the stage, filling us in with some piece of info we'll need later, and then moving on. We discover in those initial five minutes that Clint plays an aging yet popular and charming divorced small town horticulturist. We also find out that the internet is killing his beloved and once thriving business, that he has Mexican employees with whom he has a sort of jocular, buddy buddy, locker room type relationship. Oh, and his absolute love and devotion to flowers and plants has ruined his family life, divorce and separation, especially from the loving soon to be married granddaughter who just wants her PePa back. All in five minutes.....
Then we are told in writing that we've moved ahead ""12 Years Later"".
And of course Clint, code named TaTa, becomes a Mule for the cartel. The film is everything that the great Eastwood films are not: formulaic. In fact this film puts the mule in formulaic. That wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby, or with The Unforgiven...along with several others. I remember reading where Clint said that Gran Torino was gonna be his last acting role. It should have been, because if, like me, you found gran Torino to be a good yet highly predictable and cliche driven film, then just avoid The Mule. I saw nearly everything coming 10 minutes before it happened. This film lets you down in that I saw it coming sense. It's a sad waste of great talent.

He's had a falling out between the majority of his closest family members; only his granddaughter still maintains in contact with him. He is presented with the opportunity to make some money, which he takes, but what he doesn't know is that he's a mule - transporting drugs for a cartel. The money which he makes is put to use by repaying the family in ways such as covering his granddaughter's wedding, etc.Eastwood's strongest point in regards to his filmmaking has always been the storytelling. Here, it's displayed brilliantly by the way in which he's directed and performed in the film. In terms of his acting, it's the perfect role for him at this stage of his life, and it's clear to see that he had done an awful lot of research in the subject material.I was pleasantly surprised with this film, and it's defintely his best since 'Sully' in 2016.

478,sandhya60,like gran torino ..,8,15 December 2018,"Saw The Mule today. First show of the first day with the Mom who appreciates seeing movies made by her generation. I will give this a solid 8.5 out of 10. First off, its nice to see an older actor playing (and producing and directing of course) an older person from (their own) generation and era. No Hollywood play ups (with PC actors acting parts that would have never been filled by someone other than who it would have been in real life!) or PC. If you liked Gran Torino, you will like this one too. Written about a World War 2 gen and his life as a Drug Mule in the Modern World. Young people who are not familiar with this generation, because they are so far removed from it, probably will not understand the sociology of the greatest generation. This would be their great great grand fathers. So probably good idea to (have them) watch movies about this generation before seeing this one. Like I said, youngsters are too far removed to understand the way of the older generation. What makes this movie good is based on a true story, with some human events sprinkled through to add texture and dimension to the character. Older folks will appreciate seeing someone their own age, doing something daring, and illegal, rather than watching some youngster. Good adult entertainment and examination of society and what folks will do if they are driven to do something or given the chance to do something they would have never done, read the NY times article on the guy this is based on.

Audience Score: 66% (3,795 counts)
As a living legend, Clint Eastwood is definitely a milestone that you can't ignore if you are gonna watch Hollywood works. Million Dollar Baby, The Bridges of Madison County, and so countless other wild Western-themed pieces that you can easily recall have him in them.
Time passed by, at the age of 90, rumor has it that The Mule could be Eastwood's retirement work. We are not certain, but it seems that this one could be a great curtain call. This movie is actually based on a true and startling story from the New York Times Magazine. A retired 90-year-old veteran who has served in World War II, gradually found his values in shipping the drugs for the Mexican drug lord. So Eastwood decided, that at a similar age, to play this neglected, lonely, grumpy old man who's broke and has been isolated by all the women of his family-wife, daughter, granddaughter. Suddenly he is offered a new way of making easy money by a total stranger-To drive and deliver the 'goods' to a certain place and get well paid...",The Mule
481,Movie-Scene-by-Temo,A Tale of Survival,7,15 May 2019,"A man nearing the centenarian mark in age, broke and losing his house to foreclosure, estranged from family, is offered a job that he can do and would enjoy: delivering packages by car across state lines. Asking no questions, he does as he is paid well to do, only later finding out that he is hauling large, record-breaking quantities of cocaine for a Mexican cartel and unbeknowst to him the DEA wants to meet him, the drug mule famously called Tata.Hits:Clint Eastwood (Gran Torino, Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby) playing drug mule Earl Stone, friendly, generous to others but not it seems to family, is believable. Bradley Cooper (A Star is Born (2018), American Sniper), Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix, Madiba) and Michael Pena (American Hustle, Million Dollar Baby) play the DEA agents who're after him. Cooper carries off the role, but for some reason its getting harder for me to decipher what he says, same problem I had watching him in A Star is Born. The rest of the also multi-awarded cast are equally exemplary at their jobs, including Dianne Wiest (The Birdcage, Bullets Over Broadway) and Andy Garcia (Oceans Eleven, The Godfather), seasoned veterans who without apparent effort easily play everyday people living everyday lives. Okay, maybe not Garcia.Directed by Eastwood, it's an elegant re-enactment of a real life event.Eastwood doesn't shy away from the aging process. Earl Stone is affectionately nicknamed Tata (grandfather), a reflection of the natural respect and care for the aging that is seen in Mexican or other world cultures, and is shown being taught how to text by the machine gun toting criminals.At a time when we're inundated by franchised or re-told movies it's good to watch one that's original. The script from Nick Schenk (Gran Torino, The Judge) is based on a New York Times article by Sam Dolnick on ""Leo Sharp, the most prolific drug mule that regional law enforcement had ever tracked.""Eastwood managed to address the alarming statistic of death by patrolman, particularly for men of colour.Eastwood continues a long career as a story teller, doesn't let age stop him by creating a platform for himself. Because he still can.Shows Mexican-Americans on both sides of the law, DEA agents versus drug dealers.Misses:Doesn't show the anxiety, panic, sadness or humbling that Earl, a hardworking Korean War veteran and celebrated Day Lily horticulturalist, experiences when he loses his house and farm, doesn't have money to survive and has to seek help from estranged family.Doesn't show the legal defense preparation and the reason the judge ruled as he did.Let's Take a Moment:Not too long ago there were articles online on ""how to travel the world for free"" by becoming a courier. On the face of it, it may have been innocent in many cases. Nowadays it's the digital nomad lifestyle where you work from anywhere in the world and source jobs via online job sites. Who's to say that the Blue Daisy drug cartel can't hire you in Bora Bora and offer you what seems like an innocent IT job, but you're in actuality creating the cornerstone of a digital drug empire? Sometimes you just do what you have to do, if we all were to investigate employment leads before taking the job, the job would be long gone and bills would still be waiting.If you were a 90-year-old man or woman, broke, living out of an old, dilapidated pickup truck only held together by prayer and sunshine, would you take a well-paying job, questions unasked, from a stranger? At that age you can't go back home to momma (probably in home care or deceased) until you get back on your feet.

489,webmaster-1100,The plot has more holes than an adandoned crack house,4,21 March 2019,"I'm not gonna lie. This is one weird-ass movie. Clint Eastwood as a 90-year old drug mule is indeed a bizarre proposition but that actually makes more sense than most of what happens in the movie itself.How does he become a drug runner? Glad you asked. When Clint's character Earl is visiting his granddaughter for a pre-wedding brunch, a random guest at the gathering walks up to Earl as he is leaving and, based on a super short conversation about his truck, asks him if he wants the gig. Makes sense. They've never met before. Why not ask the 90-year old granddad of the bride if he wants to be a drug mule? Makes sense. And he accepts! Sure! Why not.So after the pick-up at a tire place, Earl does his first run for a mexican cartel. They have no idea who the guy is, but they gladly shove millions of dollars worth of drugs into his beat-up truck and send him on his way. When he completes the job (driving from one city to another), he spends all his newfound cash on a fancy new, juiced-up truck.Later, he pays off a large bill to get his foreclosed home back; the time after that he spends at least 25 g's to pay off debts to re-open a restaurant he likes. You'd think the cartel would caution him not to spend all his drug money at once and so lavishly, to avoid raising suspicion, given he is officially broke. Instead, they praise him on his new wheels. Sure, makes sense.On his fifth run, where he is transporting an exceptionally big 'ol load of drugs, his new handler follows him the whole way. What do they need Earl for, then, if the men from the cartel drive the exact same route anyway?It's also more than a bit odd for them to entrust a 90-year old stranger with a valuable payload given the fact that he could drop dead at any moment, for one, with his advanced age and all.At one point he has $12 million worth of drugs and they (the cartel) can't find him for over a week as he attends to his dying ex-wife. Hmm. Maybe put a tail on him or place a GPS tracker with the dope? Or, hey, maybe check if he is with a family member such as the mother of his daughter? Just an idea.As he does more runs, the cartel alternates between wanting him to follow orders to the letter and saying it might be less suspicious that he sometimes takes alternate routes and such. Hmm. They also threaten him, even though he shows repeatedly that he doesn't care about their intimidation or what they may do to him.Despite his right-wing nutty political views I actually like Clint. He is obviously a legendary actor and he's good in this movie too. Even while pushing ninety in real life he seems to be enjoying himself with this character.Bradley Cooper mostly phones in his performance as a tough DEA dude, while most of the other characters are also caricatures. Michael Peña, usually great, is particularly bad in this film.Earl's granddaughter, played by Taissa Farmiga, looks like she's around fourteen at her own wedding but that may just be Farmiga having exceptionally youthful looks.It's a really odd movie, but worth a watch for Clint's (presumably last) performance as an actor.",The Mule

I thought the story was well told and the point of the movie is clear. However, throughout the movie, without knowing the true story, I kept on anticipating various things that never happened. After the movie, after reading some critics' reviews and had some time to reflect, I realized there are many missed opportunities that could have made the movie much better.One thing to note beforehand is that the movie is inspired and based on the story of a drug mule caught at 90 years old in his ten-year record of delivering drugs for a cartel, but the movie fictionalized many things, among which is the plot around the main point of ""family is most important.""Major spoiler below. I will cover some of the plot while providing my thoughts.We started off by establishing the character of the drug mule Leo Sharp (renamed to Earl Stone). He was an outstanding horticulturist who had 180 different officially recognized breed of daylilies credited to him (fact was not provided in the movie). He was fairly wealthy and spent more time traveling to conventions and competitions than at home, which became the main conflict of the story. He was also quite a socialite, often buying drinks for the entire room and get to dance with pretty young women. Ten years later, his business became unsustainable to the point that his farm is in foreclosure and he had to pack up and find a place to stay. He decided to visit his grand daughter who is having a pre-wedding party. At that point, his ex-wife and daughter showed up and expressed direct hostility due to him neglecting family to the point of missing his daughter's wedding (only the missed wedding was shown in the movie, one would think there would be more such as missed Thanksgiving etc). Humiliated and decided to leave, a random dude in the party approached him. After the dude learned that he is an extremely experienced driver with no criminal records, the dude suggested he look for a job that pays for him to just drive. Earl did not want to consider it but quickly realized he had not many choices.My thoughts:In the real story, Leo got involved with the cartel through the Mexican farmhands he hired (the Mexican farmhands were shown in the movie). This made much more sense than some random dude approaching him at a pre-wedding party. As he was packing up to leave the foreclosed property, it would be the perfect moment for one of the Mexican farmhands to approach him and suggest a way out as he was shown to be a good boss. But sadly the story was not told like this for some reason.Back to the movie.Earl only wanted to make one run and be done at the start. But after he paid for the drinks for the grand-daughter's wedding party and got his property back from foreclosure, he quickly discovered more and more items that he could spend money on. Among these include revitalizing a pub that he often visited, his grand-daughter's student loans, and a brand new pickup truck. Throughout this process, the movie showed Earl do the full process of ""pick-up goods and deliver"" several times. Earl would:
1. Approach a shady tire repair shop
2. Get a package put in his trunk
3. Told not to look inside
4. Given a phone that he shall answer immediately and dispose of once done
5. Drive along a specified route
6. Arrive at specified time
7. Leave his keys inside the glove box
8. Return an hour later
9. Find key and money in the glove box
10. ProfitMy thoughts:Throughout the movie, this 10 step process was shown many times in full. That is why one review described the movie as a truck commerical and in my opinion, that criticism is rightly delivered as Earl in the truck was probably 25% of the screen time. This time could definitely be used for many other things that would have made the story richer.Back to the movie.There were also DEA agents trying to track down this cartel and achieve more than the single-digit mass history of drug busts in their records, which quickly led to Earl as he was making some record-breaking drug runs. Meanwhile, at about the fourth run, Earl decided to pull off the side of the road and take a look inside the bag as he was told this time is more important than the rest. A police pulled up behind him to offer assistance, and he had to deal with the dog who sniffed the drug with some hand lotion and it was quite a suspenseful moment in the movie.My thoughts:At this point, Earl started to make up for his lost time with the family (paid off students loans and etc). I thought maybe Earl will make a plan using the cartel's trust in him to bust them, and begin to turn himself around as a hero. But of course that never happened. For some reason, the movie decided to fictionalize the main conflict with the family but decides to stick with the true story's ending of Leo running the drugs to the end. For all we know, Leo might have been able to balance work and family well and never had an issue, thus making being a drug mule for 10 years believable. But in the movie, he had a hundred reasons to stop at the point of seeing the drugs and figure a way out to go back to his family.I did not realize this during the movie but I saw at least 3 different ways this movie could have a richer story and better ending.1. The movie showed the DEA through Collin Bates, played by Bradley Cooper, who had an interesting interaction with Earl in a hotel's breakfast room where they talked about Collin's missed anniversary due to trying to catch Earl and Earl giving Collin the advice of putting family before work. This interaction could and should have turned into an alternate ending where Earl collaborated with Collin to get himself out and punish the cartel. In this way, Earl becomes a hero of sorts where he chose to stay with his family.2. The movie showed a cartel member, Julio, instructed by the boss to follow Earl during one of the important runs where a large amount was being transported. This part showed us a cartel member as serious as Julio first appeared to be is still a human by showing Julio moving to the rhythm of the country music Earl listens to during the drive and showing gratitude when Earl got him out of a situation where a local sheriff approached him demanding why he was in his town. Earl was later invited to a party hosted by the boss, where Earl and Julio had a quick talk where Earl tried to tell Julio to quit as it seemed Julio did not like doing the job. Julio turned it down because the boss took him from the streets and gave him everything he had so he couldn't turn his back on a father-like figure. The conversation ended there but later the boss was assassinated by his cartel members who wanted the cartel to be more strict. Now Julio had every reason to revenge and have Earl play an important part as Earl was an important mule in the cartel. This would give Earl a way out after with perhaps a large sum as thanks. This way Earl becomes a dark hero of sorts where he helped a new cartel boss come into power and gets himself out. I don't know the exact terms but you get my point.3. Near the end of the movie, Earl was transporting a record breaking 12-mule worth of drugs and disappeared for a whole week as his ex-wife is dying from cancer and then he attended her funeral. He initially said he can't go see her when his grand daughter called, but when the grand daughter finally gave up on him being a good grand father, he decided to put everything behind and go see his ex-wife in her last moments. The cartel was furious and the DEA agents following this run was lost as no one knew where he was. This showed us how little the cartel actually knew about his whereabouts and his family history. After the funeral, his daughter invited him to Thanksgiving, effectively forgiving him. He even said something like ""not the world could stop me from coming."" He knew clearly that the new cartel won't let him go easily, and he has an even more attractive reason to get out of this business now (go to daughter's Thanksgiving after so many years and losing his wife). I thought maybe now he will work with the DEA as he knew the DEA is on him and get himself out. But he just continued to drive down the road and first stopped by cartel members as he walked out of a gas station's toilet, and then stopped on the highway by DEA agents who tracked the phone calls. This progression doesn't make much sense and just felt like the ending was picked out of a hat and they had to somehow make it into the story.These three points would definitely cost a lot more screen time, but we can certainly watch less of Earl driving his brand new truck on the road and getting threesomes with hot chicks and use those screen time to develop any of these characters further to make the story more coherent and rich.",The Mule

496,siriponbelly,"Potential story, badly executed.",3,29 March 2019,"I am surprised at how this got so much positive reviews.
The story is there, but the scripting, directing, acting and execution overall are not there yet. Making the whole movie a long, downbeat story telling.Great stars in the casting doesn't help the situation.
This is a not bad movie, and definitely not that great.I would rate it 5, to be honest, but I am rating it 3 to compensate for those 10 out of 10 reviews.",The Mule
497,wwhatt,Not nearly as good as many reviews make it out to be,1,12 May 2019,"No depth to any of the characters. So much of the humor fell flat and tonally this movie was all over the place. They really didn't know where they were going with this, incredibly hard to sympathize with the protagonist. All of the characters are two dimensional and nothing pops up.It's a safe story that doesn't attempt to really do anything besides draw sympathy from the audience for an uninspired main character. Nothing is grounded in reality because the movie fails to make any real world parrallels.If you're a proud American 50+ yr old white man who watches a lot of FOX news and doesn't question anything about what you're told about the global drug trade - you'll love it and will probably enjoy watching Clint in this movie thinking ""Wow, just like me if I was in this situation!"" which is funny because even though the bare plot points aren't rediculous, the director attempts to overload you with small details that only confuse and disorientate anybody looking for some grounding.I will say that the camera work is brilliant, but really that's it.",The Mule
498,blankenthoughts,Slow ... predictable ... unremarkable,3,27 December 2018,"If you like a slooooooow movie with a predictable ending and uninspired dialogue, this might just work for you. Clint Eastwood, an iconic Hollywood legend, has produced a mildly interesting movie. I am tempted to blow wind in its sails simply because it is Eastwood but I .... can't. I was only partially engaged because the plot was ... well ... boring.

499,Birkyirky,The Mule falls flat...,4,1 April 2019,"This was a movie that really insults ones intelligence. As much as I have respected Mr Eastwoods acting and directing craft over countless years, this movie had far to many issues within it. I can hardly believe that drug cartels and their mules would operate in such a way. As been stated in many reviews, the mule spending his new found wealth like a kid in a candy store, continually using the same vehicle for countless runs? And the two scenes with the highway patrol officers would just never unfold this way in this day and age. Did Mr Eastwood even do any research on drug cartels with regards to mules? It appears not. There was zero character development with the rest of cast and they were simply there to take up space. I could go on and on with the family part of this story but in the end it simply just wasnt good as far as a Clint Eastwood movie goes. I even read somewhere it is Oscar worthy? Not even close.",The Mule

This might be down to the Script, Direction or the Fact that the Real Life Story isn't that Interesting to Begin With.The Side Story with the DEA is Unintersting and Boring with Uninteresting Charcters. Hell or High Water, in Comparison, has the Story with Chris Pine and Ben Foster and the Story with Jeff Bridges, both have Interesting Charcters with Development along the Way that ends up with a Satisfying Story. The Mule on the Other Hand, isn't.In the End, this Film is like Crazy, Stupid, Love., in which the Film is Ultimatly Forgettable unless you like the People in it, The Mule is Like that.Recommended if you like Eastwood or Crime Films, anyone else avoid this Film unless you have an Interest in seeing it.",The Mule

No one suspicious him because he is a white veteran from Korea. Until...Even Bradley Cooper, who I despise as an actor, isn't so irritating that I was dorced to give the movie a 9/10.

The directing was great, as usual, but IMO the script ruined the film. There was hardly any backstory or motivation as to WHY he made a drastic life change and became a drug mule, he just started doing it, and the fact that he didn't realize that he was transporting drugs until the third or fourth trip made him look dumb. (you picked up a package in a garage full of men holding assault rifles, they were really aggressive with their rules, then you left the car while the transaction was made, and you were paid in cash - hmmmm)He also kept making huge purchases with cash, which breaks drug dealing rule 101, yet somehow, it never raised any red flags with law enforcement. There was also barely a character arc until the last twenty minutes of the movie, and even then I didn't see much change. The dialogue in many scenes is just flat out lame, the Hispanics kept randomly switching back and forth from English to Spanish and it was odd, and Dianne Wiest was so miscast in her role that she looked foolish.

Who wears glasses during their last minutes on earth? She wants a good view of the ceiling? A few audience members were giggling when she weezed her way to the big beyond.
2. Dumb Bad Guys. The number one rule in drug dealing is to not give the foot soldiers ANY information. So why did the main kingpin bring the Mule to Mexico to meet the gang? No wonder they knocked him off.
3. 2017 or 1957? People in Missouri gave the two druggies the evil eye at the outdoor BBQ place. Why? Because they're Mexican of course! What part of the US is shocked to see a Mexican person in a restaurant today? And to top it off the Barney Fife cop profiles them in the parking lot. Lazy writing.

556,26obiht-c,"Good movie, not outstanding.",7,27 December 2018,"This movie was a decent Clint Eastwood movie. Myself being a big fan of crime thrillers, the ""thrilling"" part does not score huge because you kind of see everything come before it happens. It is after seeing it that I realized it was not a thriller at all, and it is okay because it is not the intention of the director. This movie has some crime in it which is nice to see with the Mexican gangs and the cartel and drugs, but it is only a little side show from the main aspect of the movie.To me, this movie is all about emotion and passion. Eastwood is a very old man (90 years-old) that has his ex-wife and daughter hating him for his absence over all of the important things in their lives. However, he falls in love with his granddaughter and does not want to mess up again. He then becomes a very rich man that even broke the record of the cartel for muling the biggest amount of cocaine. He becomes very charitable for his money and wants to redempt. Right after he gets threatened by the cartel to follow every single instruction to the letter or else he would get killed, his ex-wife is diagnosed with some sort of sickness and only has a few days left to live as she is sent home. After hesitating, he decides to stay with her until she dies, at the same time disobeying the cartel's instructions.This movie is not a thriller. It is all about love, passion, redemption, kindness and is even pretty funny at times. A cute movie about a very serene old man enjoying life.Acting was good, emotion was good, the plot was good also. However, there was nothing outstanding about it either. I would give it a 7.5, however I will round it down because an 8 is outstanding, and this one is only good to very good overall.",The Mule

I grew up with his Rawhide character as a kid, and it just got more entertaining from there. But his last few have been wonderful. I especially love Gran Torino with its Christic self sacrifice. I think it was the most believable and even the most entertaining of all his pictures.My biggest criticism of Mule is giving away the ending right in the log lines.
IMO it lets some of the air out of the tires before trip #1 even takes place.The Mule was painful for me, as we watched the old, wrinkled, shuffling old Eastwood work his way inevitably to his demise. It's tough to get older and watch all those stars get to their 50s and beyond...way beyond, in Clint's case. I think we could pick a bit at this one, and find fault here and there, but what would be the point? This was a wonderful movie with a great message, no violence to speak of, and only implied sex. There is redemption as well. It was slowish, but who could notice with Clint on the screen, old age and all. In fact, the slowness could have been remedied by not giving away the conclusion with the logline! What were they thinking?Loved to see all the great actors who rallied for the Great One. Cooper is lovable as always. Michael Pena makes a most believable and endearing character arc. And the now almost hard-to-recognize Andy Garcia lends his usual warmth to a crime boss who leads one to wonder how he ever was tough enough to get to the top of a cartel.All in all, it's been wonderful having Clint's more recent movies as a welcomed counterpoint to the rampant darkness, violence, and twisted movie fare.

I love them for their craft, their tone and how different they are to the image we had of him in the 70s. My dream is to head to Spain with my brother to see the set of some of the spaghetti western films which catapulted him to fame.The music was beautiful, the cinematography grabbed me, some of the acting was fantastic. The story and the tale was good.The script and characterisation at the start was forced. The blunt racism wasn't balanced however true it might be. The depiction of crime I couldn't buy into.A few fantastic wasted actors in there as well. Bit parts with bad lines.I loved his character and I believed what he was saying. There were a lot of dead scenes, lots of things we didn't need to see, and more mystery and attention which could've been given to the things we did.There were definitely beautiful scenes, and watching the family together it rang true. And I wonder if there wasn't truth in it because there's a lot of this film which reminds me of a few stories I've felt.Clint is old in this film. He isn't the people you're seen in his other films. He isn't to be pitied, and it's to be applauded how honest he is in his depiction of himself. We all get old, and I hope I will be as honest with myself as he is when I get there.I'm not a fan boy and I don't dislike it I'm giving this review out of respect.Why zero?

I can see Eastwood was going for a more realistic real world view on what a 90yo drug runner might be like but the film was crying out for a bit of clichè action rather than drawn out highway driving scenes. The assissination of Garcia does nothing for the plot and they should have developed his character as Eastwood went AWOL. I could go on but as I said sometimes some clichè action scenes dont go astray, i would have loved to see Eastwood be thrown into having to unwilling/forced into defending himself just something to create some added drama or fear. Prehaps that would have drawn too many parallels with Gran Torino but I believe it could have been flipped to show Eastwood in a submissive/fearful light rather than dominant aggressive fearless character.

With everyone knowing Eastwood as the tough guy in most classic Western films, Eastwood is also known to act, direct, and produce his own films as well. This time, Eastwood stars as Earl Stone who is an elderly man struggling while losing his house and becomes a stand-off between him and his own family. For money, he becomes a drug mule for a Mexican cartel. While doing this, he is searched for by a DEA agent named Colin Bates (Bradley Cooper). Mr. Stone slowly realizes that he may not have time to resolve his personal problems before the law enforcement agencies and the Mexican cartel individuals catch up to him.Clint Eastwood has been known as a great actor, but we all didn't know until he started directing films that he could also direct. In some of his latest films, he has directed and acted in his own films! It's pretty amazing, but his performances have always been known to be an outstanding visual. In the Mule, Eastwood has made another great and interesting film. Eastwood's direction, alongside his acting, was seen as very interesting and amazing! The direction for this movie was sorted out well and it portrayed every scene as absorbing. The acting was also surprisingly great, even with Eastwood portraying the main character! Cooper's acting was also seen as a benefit. I did also like the use of old classic music during this film. The atmosphere in this particular movie does make it seem like Eastwood should be singing Dean Martin or Willie Nelson on his drives. Anyways, I give credit to Eastwood's direction, the acting (also coming from Eastwood), and for the decent cinematography. Clint Eastwood's 37th film stood out with intensity and with a side of heartfelt scenery.The Mule was a great movie and it is based-on-a-true-story. Clint Eastwood has done another great job! I give The Mule a 9/10 for its great direction by Eastwood, the great acting performances, and the decent cinematography. The Mule also contains some positive messages to always be there for your family no matter what is going on.",The Mule

Cinematography was very good, pacing excellent, dialogue pretty good, acting (a few actors I feel were miscast), but overall I enjoyed it.It's not a film I'd buy on DVD nor watch again. Here are the issues I had with the film.-Wasn't crazy about the actress cast to play his wife. Not sure if it was the acting choices, direction or the actress herself, but I didn't feel for her the way I should have.-The moment when Earl was speaking to his wife as she was on her death bed was melodramatic. No need to force me to feel certain emotions. Just the fact of what's about to happen, how Earl was sorry for all he did and didn't do, will evoke those emotions naturally. Having Earl's daughter and granddaughter watch from the doorways, with that sad look on their faces, was forced... just a few steps above a Novela.-The driver who got wrongly stopped by the DEA was done over the top. Not believable at all. Less is more. Having his character say all the ridiculous things he said was unnecessary and not authentic. I get Eastwood wanted to convey his scared feeling of being pulled over by DEA in cars and a helicopter above with their guns drawn, but it was too much dialogue and could have shown more rather than tell. Would have had more of an impact.The young actor who played one of the Mexican cartel (it may be Diego Cantano) was not right for the role.

The problem with the movie is it feels very rushed, causing Clint's character the be the only one with any kind of development, and that's minimal and predictable.

Predictable subplot scenes are full of ridiculous, tongue-in-cheek -- and falsely ugly -- people and character stereotypes, to the point of being embarassingly clownish. Example? The entire roadside BBQ scene. In fact, every single law enforcement scene was clownishly inaccurate procedure-wise, even at the end when he was in court and every law enforcement character was at the trial (never happens), and his sentence was handed down on the same trial -- which never happens in real life. This type of cartoonish, ignorant-of-reality stuff spoils his dramas. Another incredulous thing was the visual age of his wife and daughter versus his age -- 90.

Spreading cash around with no inquiry from a bank, car dealer and others. The scenes with black family and Mexican-American motorist. The sappy redemption angle. Poorly acted, written and directed.

While the story behind it was taken from reality, sadly, what became of this production turned out to be a great disappointment.Mr. Eastwood remains one of my favorite of the classic actors of the second half of the twentieth century and I have great personal respect for him as well, but this movie was a very poor version of what it could have been.The writing was definitively substandard in terms of character development (his scenes claiming to ""change"" such as at his wife's cancer bed were weak and flimsy and poorly directed and played.The scenes with the DEA were done so poorly that I thought I was watching a movie school dropout's entrance project. Dialogue was lame, direction was terrible and weak. Editing was mediocre. These scenes (except for the long-shots on the highways such as the near-end chase scene) were amongst the worst in the movie. The quality level of the cast, which was stellar for the most part, failed to ""save"" the scenes that they were in.In fact, this was the first A-list production by veteran actors (mostly) that I ever saw B and C level performances. So bad. Timing, emotionallity, interactions, movements. I can't believe how many reviewers failed to notice these things.There was outright amateurism throughout the whole movie. Terrible.The plot and character development were weak and filled with holes and left a lot to be desired, and I thought other than the production itself, which was the most normal part of the movie, I can't think of any reason to watch this movie other than to suffer and cringe through a Hollywood legend's last film.Clint Eastwood fans will still enjoy seeing him onscreen with all of his age-induced struggles, some of which were a part of his on-screen character, others seemed to be from the actor himself. Lots of weak and poorly delivered lines here.The movie even made ridiculous plot/character changes with random changes from some of the villains disappearing from the movie, making completely random decisions (yeah, lets shoot the boss in the back and just take over the whole operation because we disagree with him on a couple of things... without ever showing how these things were gelling all along) and lets have the primary antagonist get swapped out randomly after the protagonist drops his route.Then let's have a villain that shouldn't have been so angry in the first place have a near-complete change of heart off-screen.

And I think it's nice that you hardly need to have any character development for Clint inorder to understand what kind of character he is playing, since he always does such a nice job filling his role. The plot is actually surprisingly realistic, contrary to what most critics might say, but has a few holes here and there.I would recommend seeing this if you have an open Sunday afternoon. It's certainly not a 10, like many people are giving it, but it is definitely a solid 8, and was worth the price of admission.",The Mule

Not only does he lack basic human thinking but also the entire cast.The cartel doesnt' feel like he should perhaps change out his old truck when the feds have been pulling over tons of black trucks.The feds know the is a black truck by the motel so why don't they just search every black truck?And how in the world does it take 3 runs before Earl realises he's been running contraband.

609,codywkansas,The Mule...Clint Eastwood has done it again,10,31 December 2018,"I recently went to see the mule and other than the woman sitting in front of me, with which must be the biggest head ever, which blocked off the entire left side of the screen. And which caused me to have to leave my perfectly centered chair and abandon my friends, because when I watch a movie I want to see the movie, nothing else. OTHER THAN THAT I LOVED THE MULE. It is not as action packed as you may think and thus actually reveals a bit more realistic approach then the generic drug movie would convey. It takes its time to show how the hero (Clint Eastwood) a 90 year old has made mistakes in his life and is going through a bit of exceptance in the sorta way that captures our attention. This along with extraordinary acting by Eastwood makes this a movie that I will be buying on blue ray AND HONESTLY... I love it more than Grand Torino. Thank you Mr. Eastwood for letting me be able to watch a movie that I will Cherish for as long as I will live. From now on... when I ask about a good movie I'll think...how close does it come to being as good as The Mule.-Cody W. Kipp",The Mule

614,Slipperytwizzle,He's still got it,8,26 March 2019,"I really liked Clint Eastwood's latest cinematic offering. Still a lot of fight left in the old dog yet. It felt like Gran Torino, particularly the humour. The sarcastic, only a grumpy old man would get away with it kind of thing. Clint's character Earl has been evicted but his daughter's Mexican fiancé can get him work as a driver. He goes to the ese's garage, they load up his truck and he makes the drop off. He leaves the truck, comes back to it later where the load has been taken, and he's been paid handsomely, no questions asked. The drop off keeps happening, he's given a new phone each time, and for all the money he's getting he treats himself to a new car.Tensions rise as some of the ese's feel they can't trust Earl. On one trip Earl is accompanied by one of the ese's to see where he's going and how he's getting there.. But he's ideal.Of course, the police get wind of this but they find him so hard to pinpoint. I mean, who would suspect a 90 (sorry Clint) year old drug mule. He's hiding in plain sight. There's a conversation between Earl and the cop chasing him (though the cop doesn't know he's the mule) that happens in a diner that from the dialogue and exchanged glances suggest they are both at a juncture in their lives.
Earl is implied to be a very neglectful father and husband. Due to the immensely peculiar circumstances though this becomes resolved somewhat. In the sense that he is being hunted down by the cartel for drugs he didn't deliver, yet in that terrified that he thinks it's more important to spend time with his dying wife. It calms him. There is catharsis.
Will the cartel get him? will it be the police? he doesn't really care.I really enjoyed it. Clint is as funny, tough and culturally relevant as ever.",The Mule

The fact that it´s Clint Eastwood and that it´s maybe his last role aren´t enough for this to be a good movie. The movie has a lot of unforgivable plot ...well, mistakes, logical irregularities or script deficiencies if you will, unnecessary scenes, which take on forever, with no apparent meaning or message or situations with questionable moral messages (daughter is mad with him missing her wedding and not chipping in for his granddaughters wedding, but drug muling for a Mexican cartel is just fine, not even mentioned). Someone mentioned ""film is a study of character""?? C´mon! Not once he questions what he is doing! Reasons why? He wants to fix the burnt down vet gathering place and to renew the ICE RINK. Seriously?? Also, let´s not forget famous actors whose roles don´t do them justice. They wanted to be in what´s likely Clint Eastwoods last acting movie, so they just went for it, which role - doesn´t matter. Andy Garcia´s role is the best example here.
To conclude, Mr. Eastwood is a living legend and is still directing great movies, but do not be afraid to yell out ""The emperor has no clothes!"". This is not a good film.",The Mule

In a word, I'd say it's too soft for him.I did enjoy the fact that I saw younger generational kids shaking their heads in disappointment in the film. They probably came to see a lot of action and violence, and that's not what you get at all. That was amusing to me, because that's what they enjoy too much.That being said, it could have used some more action.It's well scripted, it has its compelling moments and it's usual dry humor Clint moments, but again I found his character to be a bit too weak.The scenes with his estranged daughter and exwife are the best parts of this film.

Others have said in their reviews that this movie was 'too slow' poor storyline, etc. etc. etc. but if you are a fan of Clint Eastwood you can truly appreciate the depth of his character in this movie. We watched it just tonight and both loved the movie. Clint Eastwood is moving pretty well for his advanced age, and he continues to hold you in the grip of his mere presence.

It's just that the whole movie left so many plot holes unaddressed, it was a disappointment from such a talented and skilled director.A man whose life as a glad-handed flirt is bankrupt when a complete stranger approaches him with a job offer. First the good-ol'-boy follows up on this with no other information that 'he will be driving.' Then the good-ol'-boy starts throwing around wads of CASH, and no one seems the least bit suspicious. Until his ex-wife is on her death-bed. Only then is the question raised.The foreclosure is paid off - in CASH, and the bank does not question. Huge red flag of illegal activity.The whole encounter with the K9 officer was unbelievable. The dog gives an alert, but the handler is impatient with him. No K9 handler would be so dismissive of his partner. And no K9 would approach a suspect when on alert. And no handler would not have his dog on voice control.The granddaughter has a comfortable relationship with her grandfather, despite the estrangement of her mother and grandmother. No back story to account for how this happens.Granddaughter graduates from cosmetology school (paid by grandfather, of course) with a cap and gown ceremony!Police officer in Missouri is easily distracted from his inquiries by tubs of popcorn!Second set of cartel handlers goes from threats and intimidations on first meeting to empathy after their mule has been off the grid for more than a week.There are more and more.

Having watched the last Robert Redford acting film which was ok, the last John Hurt film which was awful and the last Harry Dean Stanton which was good, one should now be used to seeing these cinema icons as old men but it still comes as a shock - the first view of Clint's character in this film is of an old man, bent, slightly wobbly on his feet, sunken face, etc. Maybe the body language was just good acting, the drawn physog good makeup.

664,evansluk,The Mule Review!,9,13 March 2019,"How does an old man become a drug mule for the second biggest Cartel? Desperateness leads to hard times and this is a good example of it. Your wondering why he couldn't just get out, why he couldn't just stop? These are common question you ask yourself when your reflecting on the movie. The Mule is an entertaining thriller that will make you wanting more. It has a different plot than most. I have seen hundreds of movies and I have not seen a movie like it. Their are great lessons to be learned from this fantastic motion picture directed by one of the best.The Mule takes place across the U.S. An old man name Earl Stone has not been there for his family in a while and was invited to his grand daughter´s wedding he decides to go and sees that his grand daughter is struggling financially. Shortly after the end of the wedding earl is approached by someone at the party saying he can get payed for just driving. He thinks about and decides that he will. This is where it all starts. Earl did not know what he was transporting for his first few trips, until he decides to check it out and he is frozen when he notices what it. At that point it was to late and he was too far in. One of the most thrilling scenes is when Earl(Clint Eastwood) is racing down the highway about to make his last delivery for the cartel, when he sees ,down the highway, there is a police barricade waiting for him. This scene is really cool because throughout the story you get to see Earl´s side of the story, The Chicago Police department, and the cartels side. This is good because this is really one of the only parts in the movie where all of those aspects are together in one scene. Another scene I really liked was when Earl is telling the police officer about his life in the little waffle house. This leads to good life lessons like how
family is so valuable and you should never take it for granted. Little conversations like this really make you appreciate this movie and all it has for the viewers.I could rant for hours about this movie, but i'll stop here.

Old Earl was a tiger who left the mountains, not only not being bullied by dogs, but also tidying up the pups of drug gangs.
The film will fly into the sky.
However, success or failure is in the blink of an eye. When Earl decided to accompany his dying wife, the film chose mediocrity.
For this decision, whether or not Earl will die is uncertain, and the overall picture of Eastwood's career as a director has been decided. Eastwood was duped by Earl.
Old Earl promised to change himself. He didn't lie, but he didn't tell the truth.

There are too many characters which are just part of the scenery, including Bradley Cooper. They have no role in the movie, you don't get to know their stories and they are just revolting around Eastwood's character. All the DEA story could be from another movie (they were after a kingpin and end up catching just an old man...) and that seems to be the end of the investigation.

690,house96,Worst Clint Eastwood movie.,4,6 March 2019,"Let's start with character development, except our protagonist everyone else is bland, no one cares about Earl until he becomes rich, hell before he starts financing his daughter his own ex-wife would scream at him and shame him and it all ended with ""we don't care if you are rich or not, we just want you"". The only character who has at least a bit of development is Julio, who we totally don't care after a while because he vanishes without a conclusion to his arc. Everyone else is bland, hell even the guy that hooked him up with the cartel just vanishes, just a plot device.Let's talk about the atrocious acting, biggest offender Dianne Wiest, she looked like she was on a 2nd grade recital, don't even get me started on the wierd mouth thing she does at her deathbed. Alison Eastwood has so few lines and still murders them. To end it, the extras, Alison's husband and Taissa's fiance are comical with their ""frown when we hate this guy and relax when we reconcile"".The last bad thing about this movie, and maybe the worst, was the screenplay, so many bad lines and so many plot holes. I'll list: the ice skating bit after reopening the bar/Taissa Farmiga talking to the phone with Clint Eastwood when she is in the hospital with the cliche ""they were right""/the dialogue before the head mob is killed/the mexican pulled over by the cops too much on the nose of what they were trying to do it became cringy/the whole dialogue of Earl with Julio after the threesome with the prostitutes/every Fishburne line is ""do it"" not even a bit of drama is created with the pressure from upstairs the they were trying to push in the end/Earl discovering he is transporting a lot of cocaine and he is more freaked out about the money they give him then about the drugs/etc. but the most hilarious line was after Earl declares himself guilty, his daughter says to him ""at least we will know where you will be"" the whole theatre laughed out loud.There are good parts to this movie like Bradley Cooper acting, best part of this movie was his interaction with Clint Eastwood, the part where he distracts the dog is genius usually every time Earl interacts with the cops and gangsters is treated really good.But even though this movie has some good scenes overall is a big letdown.",The Mule

I loved Breaking Bad, but Breaking Bad was a morality tale about the consequences of choosing to do wrong and the slippery slope that demonstrates how choosing to do wrong will lead to chaos and ruin. This movie offers no complex character studies nor does it raise any questions about the moral consequences of choosing to do evil. Walter White was a sociopath who was indifferent to the suffering of others while Earl Stone is just a selfish old narcissist willing to participate in drug trafficking to buy other people's love and respect.

The director showed us his point of we constantly - sometimes a little hidden, sometimes less but anytime very awareable to me. He introduced some eternal problems of all people and also some modern ones.
The great views and monuments I saw during the movie came as a bonus to me as a foreign watcher.

704,sweinrieb,CLINT STILL HAS IT,8,8 October 2021,"First, let me say that I have been a CE fan for decades, starting with RAWHIDE, going through his spaghetti westerns, which were all great, particularly with the supporting casts, and ending with THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY which will always be a masterpiece, not only for the story and acting but also for the incredible music and cinematography, particularly the entire cemetery scenes, then going through all of his DIRTY HARRY movies, thrown in there were THE EIGER SANCTION, PALE RIDER, IN THE LINE OF FIRE, BLOODWORK, WHERE EAGLES DARE, HANG 'EM HIGH....the list goes on and on. And Clint is always Clint - always doing what's right and getting the job done, and not caring what his superiors or others think. I think that this persona was also brought home in GRAN TORINO where Clint knew that HE had to do something to end the gang violence against Thao and Sue. So now we come to THE MULE - I won't rehash what others have said, in effect, a summary of the movie, but IMHO, and this is only my particular take - I have to wonder if Clint was effectively throwing some shade on our federal agencies - whether it's the FBI, DEA, whatever. Taking an overview of the movie, here is an 88 YO old man, running drugs for the Mexican cartels, they finally nab him, prosecute him, imprison him - albeit ii what appears to be a minimum security facility, but Laurence Fishburne and Bradley Cooper - no disrespect to them personally - I think that they are both terrific actors and have loved many of their movies - they almost break their arms slapping each other on the back for a job well done - WTF have they done or accomplished???? The bagged an 88 YO man! That's it. Did they nab any Cartel members? NO! Are the Cartels still operating? YES! So WTF is the BFD? They didn't do Jack Schitt!

We experience the anxiety of his first few trips and along with everyone else in the theatre...we wait for the other shoe to drop. His showcased advanced age along with his hunched posture and shuffled walk in this film is the perfect antagonist for what is expected and asked of him. We are privy to comparisons of his choices of work over family. Eastwood seems to have no regret or recollection of his daughters wedding whilst receiving an award for his prized lilies.

The real problem is the filmmakers wanted to stay close to the original true story but needed to make cinematic changes, thus leaving us with a film that is neither factual nor an interesting fiction.

First off, this man has no moral dilemma with transporting drugs. None at all. Not even hesitation. Oh yeah, I'm a horticulturalist, this seems like a totally normal thing for me to do.Next, why didn't the cartel just make him ditch the black truck? The thing that the DEA was looking for? That stood out like a sore thumb? And they knew this, too.This movie is too predictable. Eastwood, in all his former brilliance, seems to be close to, if not driving right through senescence. And he's relishing every minute of it. The predictable story line, with characters we really don't care about, and jokes that are just awkward and eye rolling shots at different races and generations.I really wanted to LOVE this one. I actually just saw Mystic River for the first time the other day, and while I wasn't a big fan of it, I still could see it for being a well made film. And I thoroughly enjoyed American Sniper.

732,georgetziris,Shallow,5,19 May 2019,"Probably Clint Eastwood's worst movie. Poor dialogues, shallow scenario. Like a bad copy of breaking bad. Not even close to Gran Torino. Very disappointed. If it hadn't been for Clint Eastwood, I would have stopped the movie before it finished.",The Mule
733,dbenamron,Just Awful,1,30 December 2018,"Nothing in this movie makes sense. The story is lame, the plot is loosely put together, the characters are random. Great cast, I guess Clint called in a favour. Keep your money and don't waste 2 hours of your life you can never get back.",The Mule
734,photographer-13731,QUALITY CINEMA!!!,10,31 January 2019,"The Mule is just another example of how GREAT Clint Eastwood is as an actor and a director!!!
This is a brilliant film, with some very funny lines and by the way ... beautifully shot.
Eleven out of ten!!!",The Mule
735,polivinemil,Feels like Gran Torino prequel and I like it,8,8 May 2019,"Nice movie. Was nice seeing Eastwood on the screen again, feels like he didn't really age since the early 2000s, Million Dollar Baby time.
The ending was kinda rushed, justice wasn't served. He took the blame proving that he's the man who takes responsibility for his actions but he would've proved that he's even the better man if he helped the police to nail the cartel. Well, I guess that's the problem of the movie being based on the real-life story.
Weird that his daughter turned from not-speaking-to-him to visiting-him-in-prison type.
The death of his life feels like the beginning of Gran Torino. If you would chop The Mule till the funeral moment and merge it with the beginning of Gran Torino, fixed a few potholes here and there and replaced Vietnamese gangsters with Mexican ones it would feel like the same movie. Even Eastwood's character feels almost the same, war veteran and grumpy.
Still, I enjoyed it.",The Mule
736,jfhartwig,Please stop with the Gran Torino comparisons,4,18 December 2018,"Dialogue seemed awkward, unbelievable, and forced. There was some character development that just sort of stopped and never picked back up. Even the cinematography was awkward, following characters out of the room or watching them walk down a hallway at the end of a scene for no reason. I really enjoyed Gran Torino despite some of its cheesy parts, but The Mule just isn't a good movie. People who claim to love it were going to love it no matter what. Extremely disappointing.",The Mule
737,wmmeld,Meh,4,16 July 2020,All I got was that Clint is old and grumpy. Could have been a Law and Order episode.,The Mule
738,hamany-manutd,Amazing!,9,25 March 2019,I blame no one but myself for not watching it in iMAX theater. Great film!,The Mule
739,antonjaeger,its kinda good,5,7 February 2019,Respectable movie but it is absolutely beond me how people in the reviews can rate this a 10,The Mule
740,eeshwarcabb,No bang bangs!,6,9 March 2019,"Given the movie's backdrop and Bradley Cooper on the titles, was disappointed Clint didn't went for any action episode. It's a decent slow burner but the pressing points which main characters were going through.., must've been more intense.",The Mule
741,marklar-64739,"Just a good, straightforward Eastwood movie",9,31 December 2018,"Good story with a character that you care about. Clint at his age has to be admired for still wanting to make films, be part of them and give the audience a message, along with some humor along the way. A very enjoyable Saturday afternoon at the movies",The Mule
742,Mary-Sommers,Love Clint Eastwood!,10,16 January 2019,"He is very charismatic in this film. I liked it and so did my family. It's hard to believe that this is based off of a true story. If you love Clint Eastwood, go see this film.",The Mule
743,d-36094,.,10,29 January 2019,I compromise myself but I don't compromise the world.,The Mule
744,leducdevo,Loved it!!,10,11 April 2019,"It's been a long time since I really enjoyed a movie that much, great acting by the entire cast. I usually lose interest with movies and start fidgeting, not this time",The Mule
745,paulinjack,Truly great movies with a few things I would fix,8,23 December 2018,I'll get straight to the point and say this is a great movie. Don't come in thinking it's packed with action and gets ur adrenaline pumping because it doesn't...Eastwood does a great job and the cinematography and pacing I feel is excellentOne main point I feel could have been fixed was how he first gained access to the cartel (a random family friend). I think this could have been handled differently and caused something to have him keep coming backOverall excellent movie and would definitely recommend!,The Mule
746,kjw-00596,So disappointing,3,7 April 2019,"Seeing Clint act and on screen with such great actors is such a great opportunity, which is squandered by the writing. This movie is a right wing social statement and fails on so many levels. Such a shame.",The Mule
747,kylepozorski,East-should've stayed home,6,24 December 2018,"This was a decent movie, but nothing to write home about. Somewhat too predictable, but also has some intense moments.",The Mule
748,info-32351,The Dog,1,27 December 2018,"How is it that a Hollywood legend who could direct and star in a recent movie like Grand Torino or Million Dollar Baby turn out a dog like The Mule? This movie is so bad that the only highlight would have been seeing the beating that the cartel goons lay on the unsympathetic, low-life character at the heart of the movie - but we don't even get that. Better luck on your next flick Clint! (p.s. you could make a dozen movies this bad and I'd still love you man!)",The Mule
749,graham-07496,Another magnificent Clint Eastwood movie,10,28 December 2018,"Like Gran Torino, The Mule is magnificent and delivers a very strong moral message, a la GT. Eastwood's subtle dry humor is such a trademark, and there is no shortage of lol lines in this one. Supporting cast were great. The character Sal, was perfectly portrayed. Hard for me to pick my favorite between this movie and GT, but I am leaning towards The Mule.",The Mule
750,mohammed-saleh-5,a good movie,8,30 December 2018,I would advise you to watch this movie. This movie is a drama in every way! i love it. thanks for reading my opinion,The Mule
751,hemalxshah,Worst,3,5 January 2019,"I am a big fan of Clint Eastwood and his movies.
I have seen most of his old movies.
My favorites are Gran Torino and Bridges of Madison County.But am highly disappointed by this movie. Entire movie he keeps on driving.No great story.",The Mule
752,nadiasstyles,Great direction,6,9 January 2019,Great performances! Excellent direction! Clint Eastwood is one of the best directors and great as an actor too! But the whole movie was really slowly for the cinema in my opinion!,The Mule
753,t-12806,"Family, Drug, Time, Money",7,10 February 2019,"This old man couldn't catch up the modern world , still living in his own way but full of fun. He's a wise man but a stupid man, who couldn't spend more time with family. So the either. In the end when these two men had the last conversation after Earl being arrested , I cried. But still happy that he could back to the flowers! Plus I lové thé bgms!",The Mule
754,dongilbreath,Characters & Plot Not Believable,5,13 January 2019,Poor casting all the way around. The drug cartel were not believable and either was the plot. This is a wait for TV or find a stream movie.,The Mule
755,cpax-55117,Flawed in several ways,4,16 January 2019,"A few flaws are minor 1) Why would a self-employed florist miss so many family events just because ""I worked 60 hours a week to support this family"". Seems that he missed them because he wanted to. 2) Are we to feel sorry for him because his florist business failed? Seems he may have failed cause he was probably spending too much time drinking at the VFW, buying drinks for the house and paying call girls 3) The drug dealers use a new cell phone for each trip but he drives the same black truck and follows exactly the same routine every load.That would be a recipe to get caught. Seems that following a different routine each load would be safer. 4) He must've been paid $10,000 to $25,000 for these trips looking at the wads of $100's. Why so much? Anyone could make those trips & secondly why not drop him after a trip or two when he was causing so much angst by not following orders. 5) I just finished a book by Congressional House Oversight former head Chaffetz- would the FBI be under alot of pressure to get results? Seems that most gov't employees could take off 6 months from work & do no work and never be noticed or called out for it, according to Chaffetz.
Now a major flaw that ruins the whole film for me. Are we to feel sorry for him at the end? Are we to admire him for pleading guilty? I say not! Anyone with any character would not do this drug mule work and kowtow to the drug dealers. The movie makes him out to be a sympathetic character and he is clearly not. I wonder if some young troubled men might look at the drug trade possibilities favorably based on this. Well I admit there are dozens of movies that Hollywood puts out there that do that.",The Mule
756,anubhavbora-14865,Clint Eastwood for the win,9,23 January 2019,Amazingly action packed. Loved the audio. The actors did a great job justifying the genre of the movie.,The Mule
757,morrislj-67357,Potential but failed to execute.,3,25 January 2019,"Eastwood is better than serviceable given his age but rather poor performances from Cooper and Pena. However, the uneventfull script didn't help. Poor acting skills of many of the supporting cast, including Eastwood's ex-wife Mary, who grows in terms of boring screentime, climaxing in a dreadful deathbed groan. There were too many unecessary scenes, in a nutshell, there was too much padding. Andy Garcia wasn't too bad but the DEA team (Cooper and Penn) were pathetic, excibiting no passion or enthusiasm when performing their lines, no tension or urgency regarding their task of bringing down a drug mule. Fishburne and Cooper had no relationship or basic report with each other. Fishburne's role was weak, all he did was complain and then cave to Cooper's suggestions. Very unnecessary inclusion. Absolutely zero suspense is built during the second half of the film. An intriguing beginning, average body and a pitiful ending. I rate this film a 3/10.",The Mule
758,dannywaynescott,Realistic without losing entertainment value.,7,5 February 2019,"This film was showing late, on a school night and i can happily say i dont regret it pushing into my bedtime. The story felt realistic. Non of the cliché plots id normally see with this type of movie. Quickly warmed to the lead character, no overly embellished drama. Enjoyed from start to finish.",The Mule
759,alviibarra,The mule,7,18 February 2019,"No real climax in the movie, slightly predictable, but it was still pretty good",The Mule
760,arjunchanda-69965,The Mule is a great watch!,9,20 March 2019,Clint Eastwood still rocking at 90! Effortlessly fits into the role of the mule! Aided by a Top billed cast.,The Mule
761,thomaskoerner-10489,A thriller? Nope,2,24 February 2019,"So boring. So slow. Not worth watching. I'm not a movie snob so my review is to tell the average watcher that this will not entertain you if you want to see action, a thriller, or plot twists. If you want to see an old guy drive a truck back and forth and have relationship issues with his family then you might want to waste your time with this movie. Sorry Clint.",The Mule
