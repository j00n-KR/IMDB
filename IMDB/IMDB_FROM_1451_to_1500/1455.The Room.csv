0,MartinHafer,"This cost $6.000.000 to make and ""Plan 9"" only cost $60,000....Mr. Wiseau needs to take some lessons from Ed Wood.",1,6 August 2011,"Tommy Wiseau...who is this guy? The IMDb biography is pretty scant and his vaguely Eastern European accent is not at all explained. What also isn't explained is how he was able to somehow get $6,000,000 to make this film--as well as HOW it could cost that much to make this movie. After all, none of the actors are professionals (and it shows), the sets look like they are the homes of Wiseau or his friends and Wiseau himself wrote/directed/starred in the film. So where did all the money go?! Perhaps some could have been spent on TVs (see the end to know what I mean). I think most young filmmakers could do just as well with $47 and a HandyCam and chimp actors! ""The Room"" seems to have nothing to do with a room. Instead, it's like a soft-core porno film where the camera gets blocked anytime you are about to see most of the nudity. I counted something like 6 sex cenes--3 of which were in the first 25 minutes!! So is the film therefore sexy--God no!! I will be nice and not make any more comments about this--you just have to see the writhing bodies to know what I mean. After all, I'm a middle-aged chubby guy and so I don't have much room to talk. But wait, I am NOT starring in a film...so yes, I can say that they were kind of scary looking--particularly Wiseau. So, if there was an award for least sexy film, this one might win....unless Ernest Borgnine made a porno.So why has this film become a cult favorite? It's the dialog....and the acting to a lesser extent. It's as if much of the dialog were written by someone with only a limited knowledge of the English language. So often the same catch phrases are repeated again and again. And often what characters say seems very, very random. And, to make it worse, the post-production dubbing is hilariously out of sync at times. Honestly, the dialog in ""Plan 9"" is no worse--especially since Wood was not trying to make a serious film--whereas ""The Room"" is deadly serious.Is it ONLY the dialog and acting? Well, no. The writing is god-awful--inconsistent, with missing plot lines AND the inexplicable need for all the men to suddenly break into a game of tossing the football--even though they are only 3-5 feet apart and even when they are in tuxedos! I can clearly understand why at L.A. showings of the film, crowd members reportedly bring footballs and toss them about during the film! And, the musical dubbing is occasionally terrible. And, the plot is dull. And, there's the problem with Wiseau's character being the greatest yutz in film history--knowing that his girlfriend is cheating on him near the beginning of the film yet continuing to stay with her AND doing the funniest temper-tantrum scene in film history late in the movie (he should have yelled ""Hulk SMASH!!!"").By the way, the film says the couple in the film have been together five years and then later in the film it says seven. Either way, considering the age of Wiseau's co-star, she would have been between 11 and 13 when they first became a couple.Also, on the DVD there is an interview with Wiseau. You must see this--the dubbing was hilarious even for this 'making of' mini-films! Plus it tries to explain the repeated use of footballs in his film! And, he wears a nice suit.In conclusion, I must quote the film. ""Why, Johnny,...why?!?...""",The Room
1,TheLittleSongbird,So inept it's not even funny,1,19 June 2011,"I have seen a lot of bad movies, some have novelty value, some are guilty pleasures and some are downright atrocious. As inept and as appalling as The Room is, for me it belongs in the unintentionally funny/complete train wreck category. The film in my opinion is quite badly made. The settings are dull in the lighting and feel very limited and overly-compact, while the cinematography and editing are some of the worst I've seen in a while. The music feels jumpy and doesn't fit with some scenes, while apart from one classic ""I feel like I'm sitting on an atomic bomb waiting for it to go off"" the dialogue is inane and painfully cheesy, the story is thinner than a sewing thread, the direction is one of the most inept directing jobs I've encountered in recent years and the film in its pace is painfully slow in many spots. The acting is also atrocious from everybody involved. Tommy Wiseau is a big reason why The Room is so bad, he shows little talent for writing or directing, while his acting fares even worse as I can't remember a single moment where he didn't make me cringe. All in all, a truly inept film, might have some novelty value, but even that can't hide how appalling The Room is. 1/10 Bethany Cox",The Room
2,SnoopyStyle,so bad,2,13 July 2017,San Francisco banker Johnny is engaged to Lisa. She is bored with him. Her mother has much advice. Lisa starts an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark. Neighbor kid Denny keeps making passes at her. He has a run-in with a thug. There is Lisa's friend Michelle and her boyfriend Mike. They all have subplots which are barely followable.I hoped for a comically bad movie. This fulfills the need for being bad but it's hard to laugh when the movie is flailing away like this. The plot is chaotic and disjointed. The writing is awful. There are story threads that go everywhere and nowhere. The dialog is clunky accentuated by the amateurish acting. The worst is Tommy Wiseau's outrageous bad over-acting. He shocks me into laughing. Most everything else leaves me scratching my head.,The Room
3,claudio_carvalho,This Is Really a Very Bad Movie,1,13 February 2018,"After watching James Franco´s ""The Disaster Artist"", it is mandatory to any curious viewer to see ""The Room"" (2003) despite the bad expectations. ""The Room"" is a terrible amateurish movie that becomes hilarious and cult so bad it is. The story is absolutely silly, without continuity and laughable dialogs giving the sensation that was written by a high-school teenager. The cast is amateurish and ham, probably ashamed and embarrassed with their lines and their names in the credits. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): Not Available",The Room
4,kosmasp,Disaster movie,3,17 January 2018,"Now I did not watch this when it came, I even avoided watching it until a couple of days ago. I wanted to see this before going into Disaster Artist (more on that movie on it's own page). Now before watching Disaster Artist I was thinking rating this a 1. Then I was like 1 sounds too much like so bad it's actually good, so I decided to go with a 2. And after Disaster Artist and some background on certain things, I'm willing to go for a 3.Why you may ask? Well, if you watch this with a couple of friends or strangerrs, this can be quite the experience. It's not about quality here (certainly not acting or script, the amount of repetition is suffocating and obnoxious to say the least), but about an experience with others about a really bad movie, that was meant to be a drama. Well I guess it's still a Drama, but not in the conventionnal sense.Tommy is really bad and it seems he has to be dubbed at times. There are quite a few ""What the ..."" moments. Tommys laugh is ... curious? Definitely very unique. There's no real story and there are 3 to 4 sex scenes in the first 20 minutes of the movie. But worry not (or do?), it changes pace from there. But there is nudity applenty, especially Tommys bare behind, and a strange position to have actual intercourse is being revealed too. Or at least a anatomically incorrect penetration spot if you want to call it that. Now that may sound just crazy, but some will find this very amusing.You can obviously watch just Highlights of this, but you will never know how bad it really is, if you don't watch it fully, to get the full experience of things. The closest to that, without going through the whole thing, is the Honest Trailer from Screen Junkies ...",The Room
5,gavin6942,The Greatest Film in the History of Western Civilization,8,17 November 2009,"Tommy loves Lisa, his future wife. But Mark, Johnny's best friend, is sleeping with Lisa. And Lisa's mother has breast cancer. And Denny, Johnny's adopted son, has a drug problem, or at least a money problem. What does all this have to do with each other? Not much.Could ""The Room"" be the greatest film ever made? Writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau thinks so. The rumor is he submitted the film to the Academy for consideration as best picture. Sadly, he was turned away. ""The Room"" may not be the best picture of the year, but is probably the single greatest film of all time, at least from a purely entertaining point of view.Yes, the love scenes are recycled. Yes, some of the dialog makes no sense. Yes, there are countless subplots that go nowhere. Yes, one of the main characters disappears halfway through and is replaced by another guy. Yes, the music is bad. Yes, yes, yes. But somehow, the more things that seem to be wrong with this film -- a film that Wiseau assures us was ""meticulously"" made -- the better it gets.I was laughing so hard, I was in pain within fifteen minutes and cried. All of the ""Oh, hi Mark"" lines, and the epic ""you're tearing me apart"" were too much for me. I ended up spewing my guts, and several bottles of Coors Light, all over the place. The intensity of the awesome in the picture just blew me away.I have a new favorite film, and that film's name is ""The Room"". What other film could make me want to play football in a tuxedo or sing the ""Full House"" theme song? Only one film has that power... for the full effect, you really need to see a midnight screening of this film with the audience participation. Or at the very least, download the RiffTrax and laugh all over again... this film could be watched fifty times and still not begin to get old.",The Room
6,jboothmillard,The Room,1,16 January 2019,"Plan 9 from Outer Space is often cited as the worst movies ever made, there are many contenders that could take that title e.g. Caligula, Showgirls, Freddy Got Fingered, Jack and Jill, and many others, but this is the one mentioned the most, so I challenged myself, also being a critic, to watch it. Basically Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker living in a San Francisco townhouse, he seems to have everything he needs, a beautiful fiancée named Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and many friends. But Lisa has become dissatisfied with their relationship, which has lasted for seven years, she finds Johnny boring and wants more excitement in her life. Lisa's classy, sophisticated mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, thinks that Johnny is good for her, and that if she truly doesn't love him anymore, she should tell him. Mark (Greg Sestero) is Johnny's best friend, he often visits the house, Lisa seduces him, despite his initial reluctance they begin a secret affair. Denny (Philip Haldiman) is a neighbouring college student, Johnny is supporting him financially and emotionally, so the young man sees him as a father figure, he also a crush on Lisa. Denny gets himself into trouble, he owes money to drug dealer Chris-R (Dan Janjigian), who threatens him with a gun on the roof of the townhouse, but Johnny, Lisa and Claudette rescue him. Johnny meanwhile overhears Lisa confessing to Claudette about her infidelity, he decides to attach a tape recorder to find out who her secret lover is. Denny confesses his feelings for Lisa himself, but he understands he is young and will find true love one day, he encourages him instead to pursue one of his classmates. Johnny is going mad with his anger at Lisa's betrayal and his desperation to find out who she is sleeping with, so he calls upon his and Mark's friend Peter (Kyle Vogt), a psychologist, for help. Mark also confides in Peter as he feels guilty about having an affair, Peter questions if the affair is with Lisa, Mark attacks him and almost tries to kill him, but they quickly reconcile. It is Johnny's birthday, and despite her insistence that she wants to end the engagement, Lisa and others surprise him with a party at the house. One of Johnny's friends catches Lisa kissing Mark while the other guests go outside, they are confronted about the affair, but then Johnny and the others come back in. Johnny announces that he and Lisa are expecting a child, but Lisa reveals that she lied about this to cover up the truth about her affair. At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who verbally and physically attacks Mark. After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom in despair, when he eventually comes out, he retrieves the cassette player and listens to an intimate conversation between Lisa and Mark. Johnny is outraged for Lisa's betrayal, she is prompted to end their relationship and engagement permanently, she plans to leave and live with Mark. Johnny has an emotional breakdown, angrily trashing furniture and destroying items in the apartment, until finally he collapses to the floor, and commits suicide, shooting himself with a gunshot in the mouth. Denny, Mark, and Lisa hear the commotion and rush upstairs, where they find his dead body. Mark blames Lisa for Johnny's death, he scolds her for deceitful behaviour, and tells her to get out of his life. An emotional Denny wants to be alone with Johnny, Lisa and Mark step back to give him a moment, but ultimately, they all stay and comfort each other as the police arrive. Also starring Robyn Paris as Michelle, Scott Holmes as Mike and Greg Ellery as Steven. Wiseau (also writing, producing and directing) is an ugly and untalented actor, Danielle is equally dire as his long-suffering girlfriend, and most of the other cast members are either inexperienced, or just let down by the terrible dialogue they were given. It includes many elements you would expect to see in a badly made independent movie, silly characters, bad acting, repetitive and terrible dialogue, clumsy camerawork, mistakes included and not edited out, the odd green-screen background in the rooftop scenes, bad editing and narrative structuring, there is no real story or plot, and supporting character subplots are unresolved, most prominent being the mother's breast cancer storyline. But for its bizarre and unconventional storytelling, technical and narrative flaws, Wiseau's ridiculous performance, and its overall awfulness, it has gained a cult following, and it spawned the more successful biographical film about the making of it, The Disaster Artist, I admit myself that I couldn't stop watching this, it was funny for all the wrong reasons, and it one of those ""so bad, it's good"" experiences, but it is a lacklustre black comedy romantic drama. Poor!",The Room
7,paul_haakonsen,The title makes no sense when you watch the movie...,3,14 August 2017,"I was recommended that I sat down and watched ""The Room"" as I have never seen it, only known about it by having heard friends mention it. I didn't really know what the movie was about, only that it was supposed to be a legendary bad movie. So of course I was a bit hesitant about actually taking the time to sit down and watch it. But since I had the chance, I decided to do so.And I can say that I have watched it now and can tick it off my watched movies list. In all honesty I can also say that this is not a movie that I will ever be watching a second time.The storyline in ""The Room"" was rather pointless. It was about a guy named Johnny whose girlfriend decides to have an affair with his best friend as she has grown tired of Johnny. And that was essentially the entire storyline wrapped up right there. To compliment this profoundly deep and fulfilling storyline was equally pointless and prolonged love-making scenes which didn't further the story one bit, and the movie would have been just a notch better if they had opted to not include those scenes at all.""The Room"" has a rather generic and flat character gallery to bring the story to life on the screen. And it didn't really help one bit that most of the cast were doing fairly poor jobs with their given roles and characters; most noticeably writer and director Tommy Wiseau whom also happened to play the lead role himself.The entire movie builds up to a confrontation between Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau) and his best friend Mark (played by Greg Sestero), and this confrontation climaxes into what has to be one of the most hilarious and horrible fight scenes ever put to film between two men. The scene was intended to be serious and dramatic, but I was laughing so hard that I had tears in my eyes when I saw that, and I actually went back to watch it a second time just for an additional laugh.This epic fight scene then bridges over into a scene where Johnny has an uncontrolled fit of rage and totally ravages his bedroom as his girlfriend leaves him. This scene tops the fight scene in its level of ridiculousness. In fact, it is so bad that it has to be witnessed in order to fully grasp how bad it is.""The Room"" makes use of some green screen as well, which is quite odd, because it is when they are on the roof of their apartment building, then instead of just filming on top of an actual Apartment Building they opted to go for green screen. And the end result was just atrocious, as the background looks horribly fake and seems more like it was the result of an elementary school student's attempt of fidgeting with green screen.I can agree with my friend's statement that this movie is so bad that it actually has to be seen, because it truly is. ""The Room"" scores a 3 out of 10 stars from me, and I feel rather generous with that rating actually, which is primarily because the movie has an adequate production and editing value to it.",The Room
8,Quinoa1984,keep this in mind: people who award this a '10' are not being serious oh hi Mark,1,20 March 2010,"Tommy Wiseau may be a genius somewhere inside of his mind. I would still be interested to see it leap out at us unsuspecting viewers. For now, we have The Room on our hands, one of those real marvels of bad movie-making. It's a hilarious kind of bad movie, where one can see that the actors are trying, for better or worse (no, usually for the worse) to act in a serious capacity in their characters. The Room was written as a play first, and it shows: scenes in rooms, scenes on a rooftop (and what a view, ho-ho), scenes in a field somewhere throwing around a football, and back to the Room again. And now it's being touted by its maker as being a 'comedy'. This is called 'after-the-fact' thinking. It was made as a drama, in all sincerity, and now it's a matter of saving face, it becoming a midnight movie, a riot. It's worth it.Watch it with friends if you can't watch it with a packed audience. It's that kind of bad movie, where one can marvel at how Wiseau managed to eff-up continuity, where actors are supposed to be in a scene, repeating things they just said, saying things that are inconsistent with things said before, characters who disappear for stretches and reappear as if they were just there in the room the whole time. I admire a filmmaker who can do something this wretched, since it shows that somewhere inside of this guy is a voice of an artist. Bad, misguided, and perhaps just untalented. But who is Ed Wood if not an untalented artist who had a lot of ideas and a lack of skills and where-with-all to do it? Oh, and did I mention the film takes place in San Francisco? This point is hammered in so much you expect for Bullitt to roll over the hill at some point and run over one of the kids playing football. I could attempt to go further and describe the plot, but is there any aside from these several words: Johnny (Wiseau) has a fiancé he loves, she's cheating on him with his best friend, and neither of them can commit to letting Johnny go. Nothing else happens except many scenes of talking; someone may have mentioned a chamber drama in comparison to The Room, and it's not far off. I imagine Wiseau is a big fan of Ingmar Bergman, specifically Cries & Whispers (red walls, anyone?), and if so, more power to him. That it's often so bad as to be unwatchable, when not crying-buckets-of-tears hysterical in its laughter-quota, should also be noted with that.And one more thing that needs to be said about Tommy boy: he's not a good actor. This is something crucial - he is an easy target for us folks who watch bad movies searching for the next bad actor around the corner. He's so awful not simply because of his lack of emotion in scenes, but how over-emotional he gets when, say, he channels James Dean, or at the end when he (in an act ala Orson Welles in Citizen Kane) tears apart the house at the end. When he enters on the screen it's like an 80's hair-metal cover band is missing its roadie, and he's still in training. He may be inept as a director, and writer, and casting agent, and especially at those sex scenes (good God, someone resurrected BoyZ 2 Men!), but seeing him in the titular lead role is about enough to drive most sensible human beings out of the theater in droves, or shut off the DVD and ask netflix if it was a mistaken delivery.For the rest of us, however painful it can get, The Room is an entertaining debacle, poorly produced and all the funnier for it.",The Room
9,CinemaSerf,The room (for improvement),4,7 November 2021,"I suppose that you just have to leave your brain at the door for this nonsense. Sadly, at this most recent showing in London, we were not permitted to throw spoons (nor in theory, to call out - but, hey - good luck with that!). Anyway the somewhat unattractive ""Johnny"" (Tommy Wiseau) is living with pretty fiancée ""Lisa"" (Juliette Danielle) who decides that she'd probably rather hook up with the rather handsome ""Mark"" (Greg Sestero)... Will they get rumbled? Will things ever be the same again? Of course, the dialogue is abysmal, the sex scenes filmed in an out of focus fashion that we can only ever be truly thankful for, and the soundtrack is so cheesy that the whole thing just engenders audience participation on quite an unprecedented scale. This is garbage; there is no other word for it - yet it is eminently watchable (after three bottles of wine and some i/v gin). Carolyn Minnott is wonderfully earnest as mother ""Claudette"", too. It's amateur in just about every way, but funnily enough that might just be the reason it has achieved cult status. Aim very low, and you will still be setting your sights too high!",The Room
10,grantss,Deserving of being regarded as one of the worst movies of all time,1,11 February 2018,"Johnny and Lisa are engaged and in a month will be married. Everything seems idyllic but Lisa is finding Johnny boring and has an affair with his best friend, Mark. Things start to escalate...Regarded as one of the worst movies of all time, and rightly so. Written, directed and starring Tommy Wiseau, the crappiness is largely a solo effort. Incredibly badly written: the dialogue is so bad to be quite bizarre at times. The central plot - the Johnny-Lisa-Mark love triangle - has no depth at all and really just goes around in circles. The lack of substance in the central plot is padded by random sub-plots and scenes that add nothing. Acting is about as bad as the writing, with Tommy Wiseau to the fore, again. He is so bad he makes Arnold Schwarzenegger look like Marlon Brando. ""Hammy"" doesn't even come close to describing how bad he is, sometimes looking like he is just reciting lines that he is wholly disinterested in (which he wrote!) and then delivering in a ridiculously melodramatic manner (""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"" launched a thousand gifs). The remaining cast aren't great but aren't anywhere near as bad as Wiseau. They are helped by being in the same scene as him as he's so bad he makes them look okay.Direction is pretty much uninspired paint-by-numbers, though is not as laughable as the script or acting.There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. It's not accidentally a decent comedy while trying to be a serious drama. No ""So bad, it's good"" for it. This movie is incredibly bad, full stop.",The Room
11,evanston_dad,You're Tearing Me Apaaaaaart!!!!,10,6 December 2017,"I have to believe I'm not the only person who was prompted to see ""The Room"" in preparation for James Franco's well-received ""The Disaster Artist,"" the story of the cult classic's creation.Called the worst movie ever made by many, what I think people mean is that ""The Room"" is one of the most entertaining bad movies ever made. It's certainly not the worst; just try watching a movie like, say, ""ThanksKilling"" for an example of a movie so bad that it's unwatchable. No, ""The Room"" belongs to the same category as something like ""Battlefield Earth,"" films so earnestly made yet so poorly executed that they become more entertaining than they would have been had the filmmakers been able to make a legitimately good movie.One can't really provide a description of ""The Room"" that will come anywhere close to approximating the experience of watching it. Tommy Wiseau, the film's legendary and strange creator, plays Johnny, who's been dating Lisa for something like six or seven years and who he refers to throughout the entire movie as ""my future wife."" The problem is that Lisa hates Tommy and doesn't want to marry him, despite bonking him repeatedly. It never seems to occur to Lisa that she could just tell Johnny she doesn't love him anymore, so she instead complains to everyone who will listen to her how bored she is by him and even makes up stories about him getting drunk and beating her. No one seems especially bothered by this prospect, perhaps because Lisa is such an unpleasant person that we don't understand why Johnny wants her in the first place. O.k. maybe it's not so far fetched, since Johnny isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, and his prospects for female companionship that he doesn't have to pay for are probably limited. He clearly is drawn to Lisa's formidable intelligence, because he thinks her suggestion that they invite a bunch of friends to a birthday party she plans to throw for him (despite hating him) is ""a great idea,"" which I guess is if the alternative idea is to invite a bunch of random strangers. And Johnny isn't alone; at said birthday party, she suggest that they should all eat some cake, and the party goers act like that's an idea no one's ever had at a birthday party before.Complicating matters is Johnny's best friend Mark, who gives a brilliant discourse on gender politics in which he categorizes all women as stupid or evil. Given the women in this movie, he may be on to something. Lisa has the hots for Mark, and they pick the least comfortable spot in the apartment (the bend of a spiral staircase) on which to consummate their passion (though I'm not sure if anything was actually consummated since Mark appears to be humping Lisa's knees). Mark seems like a bit of dim bulb himself, since every time thereafter that Lisa initiates sex his first question is ""What are you doing?"" The most mysterious character in the movie is Denny, an orphaned kid who lives God knows where but who pops in all. the. time. and who we're told thinks of Johnny as a father figure, though, given the fact that the first scene with Denny finds him wanting to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex, he might have wanted to shop around a bit more. Denny is always carrying either a basketball or a football and acts like he's twelve despite the fact that the actor playing him is about twenty-five. Once in a while, some combination of guys will actually play ball with him, which involves standing about three feet from each other and gently tossing the ball around like it's an explosive device. After some ball tossing on the roof of Johnny's apartment building, and then some more ball tossing in a cramped alley, I started to wonder whether or not San Francisco had any parks these guys could go to, and then later in the film when they actually go to a park, I wondered why they didn't go to one sooner.My favorite character is Lisa's mom, who walks into every situation and expresses disbelief that she's surrounded by dipsh*ts, a sentiment I shared. Nothing phases this woman, not breast cancer, not drug dealers, not random people using her daughter's apartment for a booty call. Whatever's going on, she's just so over it. And another supporting character is Johnny's psychologist friend, who looks like the bald Nazi from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and lurks in the background, lit by the camera man like a serial killer.Every scene in ""The Room"" feels like the intro to porn sex, no matter what combination of people are present. There are actually a couple of soft core scenes, both featuring Johnny and Lisa, though it actually only counts as one scene since the second one uses the EXACT SAME FOOTAGE as the first. Needless to say, they're not very erotic unless you find weirdly veiny men of an indeterminate age erotic, or are turned on by the sight of rose petals mashed into a woman's back like giant ticks.I don't know why ""The Room"" is called ""The Room."" There is a room in the movie, in which almost all of the action that doesn't occur on the roof takes place. The set decorator clearly thought that Johnny and Lisa are the kind of people who decorate their apartment with giant candles and bowls of fruit, which comes in handy when Denny needs to eat an apple as a way of managing the sexual frustration that occurs when Johnny and Lisa aren't up for a menage a trois.Maybe he should have played some football in the alley instead.

12,AlsExGal,I was very disappointed...,5,2 October 2009,"it just wasn't that bad. I actually purchased this after I saw a news item on blocks long lines of people waiting to see this film ala ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". What I was expecting was ""so bad it's good"". And yes, it is not good, but it is also not so bad that it would really qualify for MST3K. Granted, there are lots of hallmarks of bad film-making - wooden performances, strange reactions, subplots that go into a brick wall, and what is it with that footage of Alcatraz between every scene? This is the story of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his fiancée, Lisa, who discovers she is bored with Johnny shortly before their wedding. A cast of characters pop chaotically in and out of the plot, which include Johnny's voyeuristic young ward and Johnny's best friend who winds up sleeping with Lisa, but does at least show his loyalty to Johnny by whining about it before, during, and after. Lisa's mom's performance is certainly one for the books. She casually mentions she has cancer as though she has mentioned a hangnail and then nothing is ever said about it again. Lisa certainly doesn't seem that worried about her mother's impending doom. Maybe her lack of concern is understandable considering her mother is always telling her she needs to stay with Johnny since Lisa doesn't have what it takes to make it in the job market and needs someone to take care of her. This is a mother figure the way Howard Hughes used to write them.This whole film viewing experience leads me to one conclusion - young people today are both spoiled and deprived when it comes to film. They are spoiled in the sense that they think this is the worst film in history just because of the rather cheap sets and oddly constructed storyline. Independent filmmakers that make such films as a rule have been priced out of the market, and all that is widely released today are prepackaged superhero films with special effects to dazzle and scripts that have no impact on the soul. Young people are also deprived since they don't get to see much ""so bad it's good"" film-making either. If you want to see truly bad films that entertain feast your eyes on ""The Killer Shrews"" with dogs suited up in bath mats as the shrews. Also, try any film written by/directed by /starring Ed Wood and see what really bad stream-of-consciousness dialogue and cheap art design are all about.I gave this film five stars because more stars would say it's a good film, which it isn't, and less stars would say it is really bad, possibly to the point of being interesting, and it's not that either. It's mediocre - which means it really is not worth your time.",The Room

Title references what is obvious to everyone save for the hero, who is dethroned by his own ignorance. Incompetent filmmaker Tommy Wiseau, who also wrote this travesty, stars as Johnny and he cannot get through a scene without chuckling at nonsense or plainly addressing everyone with the familiar, ""Oh hai (insert name here)."" He writes Johnny as this beloved guy who didn't get the promotion at the bank. He enjoys playing football while wearing a tuxedo, and having the most dreadful sex ever put to film. Juliette Danielle plays Lisa, Johnny's fiancé and she is written as a scheming bitch who cannot decide whether Johnny is a great guy or somebody she can destroy. Greg Sestero plays Mark and we are reminded constantly that he is Johnny's ""best friend."" He and Lisa are having an affair and Johnny has an unlimited cassette recording to prove it. Philip Haldiman plays a creepy kid named Denny who likes to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex as well as being part of a pointless drug related subplot.

Johnny can also be a little too trusting at times which haunts him later on.Lisa is a beautiful blonde fiancé of Johnny. She has always gotten her way and will manipulate to get what she wants. She is a taker, with a double personality, and her deadly schemes lead to her own downfall.Mark is a young, successful and independent best friend of Johnny. He has a good heart, but gets caught up in Lisa's dangerous web and gives into temptation.This eventually brings him to great loss. Claudette is the classy, sophisticated mother of Lisa who has had disappointing relationships in her life. She wants her daughter to be married as soon as possible so she can benefit.Denny is an orphan boy, naive and confused about life, love, and friendship. Denny is very ambitious and also very grateful to the people that are in his life.....What is there to say about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's an amazing film to watch, so full of atrocities to the senses we carry, that you really have to see this to understand the badness/greatness of it all.It drags in some scenes, but for once, the best bits of this, is when characters are talking to eacj other. From the dismissed 'I have breast cancer' line, to 'Cheep Cheep Cheep Cheep', it really does hold your attention.The basic story is that a man gets unfairly treated in life....thats it.But Wissau makes this film/movie/miracle into something more.....something mystical.It's the sort of film that hooks you from the upstart, and doesn't let you go until the very end.Even though I love this movie, I cannot give it a ten, it's just weird to give it that. A film to show your kids if they have been naughty.",The Room
15,zetes,"Funny, but mostly boring",3,19 September 2010,"Infamously terrible film. I must admit, it's funny, but, man, is it repetitive and boring. Wiseau, who speaks English with a heavy European accent, plays a thoroughly nice and possibly retarded man who is about to marry his longtime girlfriend, Lisa. Unfortunately, Lisa is cheating on him with his best friend Mark. That's pretty much the entire plot of the movie. For 99 minutes, Wiseau stumbles around saying, ""Oh hai!"" to everyone he comes into contact with. Whenever he leaves Mark and Lisa alone in a room together, they start screwing. Their friends and relatives keep trying to convince Lisa to break it off with him, though none of them are good enough friends to just outright tell poor Wiseau. A couple of subplots get introduced, like Lisa's mother's cancer or Wiseau's young protégé's dealings with drugs, but they get dropped because the affair is just so damned interesting. The movie's sort of interesting psychologically, though pretty simplistic: Wiseau obviously based the script on his own insecurities (whether a woman ever cheated on him or not), and the film basically contemplates why he either can't get or can't keep a chick. Look up the funny moments on Youtube, but leave the actual film for the braver viewers amongst us.",The Room
16,Mr-Fusion,Awful was never this funny,8,12 March 2016,"It's not every day that a bad movie can be life-affirming. And that's what makes ""The Room"" such a treasure. It's an exercise in shoddy filmmaking, but there's something about it that's just . . . well, it's just a whole lot of fun. And yes, I do mean it's a lot of fun to bag on this hot mess, but doing so has never felt so satisfying.If you boil this movie down to its base elements, Johnny loves Lisa, Lisa cheats on Johnny. Why does she? Ehh, not really sure. It's not like he deserved it, really - I mean, he's a super nice guy. He's not the best looking guy, but she didn't seem to have a problem with it. And the rest of the movie is just Lisa being a galactic hussy (seriously, they don't come more arbitrarily two-timing than this).There's a lot here that goes unanswered. What happened with the mother-in-law's cancer? Will Denny get off drugs? Why does Mark turn on Johnny? You can tell this is supposed to be a big tragedy, kind of an inept Tennessee Williams joint. But nothing about this comes off like it should. Subplots are introduced and then forgotten, the dialogue's full of non-sequiturs, and there's not really any meaning to anything. Add to that the bad green-screening and the Skinemax production values, and you're witnessing a veritable trainwreck.But, my god, is it entertaining. Ninety minutes chock-full of unintentional hilarity. The reputation is there for a reason, and it's definitely earned. The ""so-bad-it's-good"" label is thrown around so often these days, but it truly applies here.In the best way possible.8/10",The Room
17,StevePulaski,The Room Locks You In,2,21 October 2010,"The Room has been called ""the best worst movie"" and ""the Citizen Kane of bad movies"". It is definitely a bad movie, but it doesn't even know it's bad. It goes so over the top with its acting, with Tommy Wiseau to blame mainly. and so thin on progression and depth. It's even a challenge to review since many of the scenes basically plea to be seen rather than to be discussed from a narrative perspective.Tommy Wiseau is the film's error in a nutshell. He is a horrendously poor actor, doesn't know exactly how to recite his lines in a believable, and for that matter convincing, manner, and has this awkward, stiff screen presence. Think of Jean-Claude Van Damme's talentless brother. I've heard from many that when you meet him in person and comment on how bad The Room actually is, he doesn't even know what you're talking about. He is oblivious to the fact that he created one of the most laughably bad dramas in recent history. But also, the most entertaining in the worst possible ways.The story is about Johnny (Wiseau) who is about to be engaged to a gorgeous women named Lisa (Danielle). What Johnny doesn't know is that Lisa's love for him is wearing thin to the point where she resorts to having an affair with Johnny's friend Mark, played surprisingly well by Greg Sestero, who seems like the only person that is trying to give a decent performance. There's also a kid named Denny (Haldiman), Johnny's neighbor whom Lisa and him treat like a real son. I use the term ""kid"" loosely. We don't know how old he is, if he has parents, or what his purpose is at all. At times, he seems like he could be a functioning adult, but at other times he acts like a curious ten year old.The biggest problem, besides some of the most atrocious acting in recent years, is the countless number of continuity errors and abandoned subplots that plague the film like a virus. Not only does Wiseau seem mostly unfocused, but so does the whole script. There is an instance where Lisa's mom is talking with her daughter and brings up that test results prove she has breast cancer. Gee, that's pretty depressing and sad, huh? Would you believe Lisa doesn't even ask a single question afterwards? We have bigger topics to tackle. Like Lisa becoming uninspired and bored with her relationship.Another scene that feels like it was added in during post-production is the scene where Denny has a violent encounter with a drug addict on the roof of their apartment. It's arguably the most interesting and climatic scene in the film, but we fail to garner any specific backstory. Just this rushed, deflated scene, and then it's on to the next anomaly of filmmaking, with this instance never to be mentioned again.This is a cult film in every sense of the term, and the one star rating should not be viewed as a heavy one. I am inclined to review films based on whether or not they are good, and what I believe they rightfully deserve. The Room doesn't deserve a positive rating, but that doesn't mean I didn't personally enjoy it. It's not a good movie, but I had fun watching it and was never bored. I would almost go on to say its viewing is vital for those who are brave enough to hold out for it. Its comedic value is high, yet its quality value is shockingly low. I guess I can say I've never seen a bad movie this good.Starring: Tommy Wiseau, Juliette Danielle, Greg Sestero, Philip Haldiman, Carolyn Minnott, and Robyn Paris. Directed by: Tommy Wiseau.",The Room
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,Tommy Wiseau used me and I am the fool,1,3 August 2010,"Oh, wow, um, where do I even begin with this movie? I suppose I could tell you how I heard of it, like most people I heard about this movie from an internet reviewer(the Nostalgia Critic). I honestly would've never heard of this film either, probably would have never seen it. But after the clips I saw, I HAD to see this movie, I went on Amazon.com immediately afterwards and ordered it. Now I knew this movie was going to be bad, but I HAD NO IDEA! I think it's one of those movies that had to be handled in clips because I cannot tell you all the safety precautions you should take before watching this movie. My boyfriend tried to commit suicide while I just wanted to find Tommy Wiseau and do some things that even the Dark One would look at me and say ""geez, take it easy on the guy"". I cannot even describe how this movie is bad. The acting is like the actors are literally reading the script for the first time. Tommy Wiseau's acting, I don't know if there's a word for how bad it is so we'll just say it's ""aguwaba"", also it seems his voice was dubbed over. Now I thought this was because maybe he only speaks one language that isn't English, but he speaks with this stupid indefinable accent all the time, so why is his dubbing the same way? Where is he from? Brazil, Romania, France? I have no idea.Lisa has become inexplicably dissatisfied with her fiancé Johnny, confiding to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds him boring. Lisa seduces Johnny's best friend Mark, and they begin an affair that continues throughout the film, even as Mark more than once tries to break it off. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa gets closer to leaving Johnny for Mark. When Lisa throws Johnny a surprise birthday party, she flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, and Johnny and Mark get into two altercations. Johnny has also attached a tape recorder to the telephone, recording an intimate call between his future wife and Mark. Now that Johnny is ""fed up with this world"", feeling like he cannot trust anyone, he pulls the ultimate punishment in self loathing to himself but a true gift to the audience.This movie is just incredible that it was made, I didn't think it was possible to make a film so bad. It's like it's a new genre, just a bad movie. Sub plots get brought up out of no where in this movie and never get brought up again. Characters get brought up and again never mentioned. The script, story, characters, editing, setting, everything was just wrong with this movie. Also Tommy Wiseau's name is mentioned 6 times before the film even begins and his character is of course ""perfect"" that everyone should just love him. Lisa, who is very odd looking, is constantly called ""sexy"" which either has a new definition or is ironic. Mark is a doof ball that probably thinks that penguins are fish, because he's just that stupid. Denny is a perverted 15 year old who wants to watch Johnny and Lisa make love and constantly says how in love with Lisa he is and how he loves Johnny. Also there is so many pointless love scenes, football scenes, gift giving scenes, lines, if there was a drinking game on the pointless scenes for this film, you'd die of alcohol poisoning by the end of this movie. I don't know, it is one of those films you have to see to believe, but I can tell you one thing for sure, if Tommy Wiseau thinks we're laughing with him, he should check that we're actually laughing at him.1/10",The Room
19,blanbrn,Your tearing me apart! An interesting and compelling soap opera like drama that twist with life and love while leading to tragic means.,8,18 January 2018,"Finally after all these years finally watched the cult classic ""The Room"" as it's a favorite for many art houses and independent movie chains as the film still has countless midnight showings. Many consider it the worst movie ever made, however after watching I disagree, as I liked it the film was blended with drama and twist of love and lust that lead to bad means for all involved as really it was a good black hearted comedy.Set in the city by the bay ""San Francisco"", Johnny(Tommy Wiseau) is a successful investment banker who enjoys life and love as he plans to marry his younger and sexy girlfriend Lisa(Juliette Danielle). However this is the game of life it's not always a bed of roses(unlike the love making scenes!)as lust, passion, lies, and betrayal take over.Johnny has a best friend named Mark(Greg Sestero) and all three become involved in a web a deadly game of temptation as these games slowly, but surely lead to loss for all involved. This film is a great take and spin on life, love, and friendship, as can anyone be trusted? It proves love runs deep, yet when lust and passion mix it's a deadly combination. Overall well done movie that teaches lessons in a painful way, and the movie is spiced up by love making scenes and the acting and on screen chemistry between the actors is good for a low budget independent that would become a historical cult classic.",The Room
20,Red-Barracuda,An astonishing movie experience,7,10 August 2011,"Sometimes it's difficult knowing where to start in reviewing a movie. This film is perhaps the ultimate example where words are simply not enough. The Room is a film that almost defies description. It really has to be experienced in order to understand why it has garnered a reputation as the most celebrated bad movie of the last decade. Unlike previous so-bad-their-good flicks such as Plan 9 From Outer Space or Troll 2 and countless others, The Room is not a sci-fi, horror or action flick. It is pure and simply a melodrama. This explains part of its huge impact in that it sort of appeals to both male and female audiences alike, while it is really quite unusual to see a film in this genre being quite do spectacularly bad. The Room is undoubtedly one of the funniest things I have seen in a long, long time.I'm not going to go into specifics here as to individual moments that make The Room the comedy classic that it has become, simply because there are far too many and it really needs to be seen to be believed. However, it would be remiss to not mention the character Johnny played by Tommy Wiseau. Johnny is the central character in the story. He is an overly nice character who others take advantage of. He seems to either be retarded or is recovering from a stroke. Wiseau is a very unusual central character, while his sex scenes are deeply disturbing – almost like scenes from a scary sci-fi horror film. Wiseau is of course the auteur behind this thing, he wrote and directed it and so therefore needs to be given some credit for producing something that is simultaneously so bad yet so committed and so deadly serious. He has attempted to claim after the event that The Room was intended as a black comedy. Don't be fooled by this for a second, this movie plays it completely straight. It's so very funny because of this fact. It is an absolute impossibility to make the specific anti-genius of The Room intentionally.I have seen it a couple of times. The second of which was at a public screening and I have to report that I have never witnessed anything like it. It was the closest a movie-going experience ever got to the feel of going to a gig. The sense of excitement beforehand was palpable and once the movie started rolling the audience was extremely lively throughout with no let up from start to finish. It ended with a standing ovation. It was quite incredible. I have never witnessed the like before. Tommy Wiseau I salute you.",The Room
21,KineticSeoul,"This movie is ""Tearing me apart!""",4,24 May 2014,"This is a movie filled with friendship, betrayal, lust and sports. All compacted into a masterpiece of a film with unique characters and so much emotions. Yeah, this is probably my first time using sarcasm in this review, mainly because this whole movie seemed like a giant ball of sarcasm. Tommy Wiseau is either a genius (well someone that knew what he was doing) and wanted to go in a black comedy direction or a hack of a director that really tried to make a serious drama. Like he knew the main drive of this movie is himself playing Johnny with the most corny and awful acting ever. What shocked me the most about this movie is how he was able to raise 6 million dollars for this so called movie. He probably pocked just about all of it, seeing how this movie seems like something made from a shoe string budget of less than 2 grand. During a interview Tommy Wiseau mentioned that he intentionally made a bad movie on purpose that would stand out from the rest. In my opinion it can go both ways. Watching this movie is like watching the movie ""I Am a Sex Addict"" except even worse, but better at the same time, if that makes sense. This is a movie you just have to go with, without taking it seriously in order to get a bit of entertainment out of for all the wrong reason. This movie came out in 2003, but looks like something from the 60's. Everything and everyone in this movie is just super awkward, especially with the interactions amongst one another. I just recently saw this movie called ""Joe"" which is actually a good movie and I can see the similarity between the characters Joe and Johnny to a certain degree. Both are the good-intentioned characters that tries to take care of a youngster, except Johnny throughout the whole movie with the plot and all tries to prove how much of a good guy he is and how everyone is scummy. He however comes across as those supposed nice guys that gets annoying really quickly, except he is so freaking weird and odd that actually makes him unique in a sense. Tommy or Johnny is someone that oozes with some much cheese and grease that it makes everything he says and does hysterical in a sense. There are cheesy and greasy characters in other movies before, but for this case it just didn't seem intentional. Especially see how Tommy Wiseau seems to be a bit on the narcissistic side without taking things too seriously. This is a movie that you just have to watch with a crowd to get the most effect out of. Because this is a movie that the audiences can participate with and makes it their own and recite phrases while having fun with it. This also has probably the worst sex scenes I have ever seen in a movie so far and the super cheesy and melodramatic music playing the in background makes it all cringe-worthy. It's just something very very very difficult to watch. The cinematography is awful, the acting is equally as awful (it seemed like the actors and actresses knew how bad this movie is thus couldn't take it seriously), the plot and characters is inconsistent, doesn't make any sense and just plain downright dumb. Just don't take anything in this movie seriously and watch it with a crowd and play along with it, you just might have a good time with this. Cause I will probably never ever watch this movie by myself ever. I give this movie a 4.5 by combining the score of this movie as a movie and from the entertainment you can get by roasting it and playing along with a crowd.4.5/10",The Room
22,thesar-2,No Room Available,1,2 December 2012,"No, no, no, no, no, no, NO! The Room is not a black comedy as arrogant writer, star, distributor, producer and obviously blind director, Tommy Wiseau would want you to believe. Heck, it doesn't even have a single black person, much less anything but unintentional humor.Could The Room be absolutely the worst movie ever made in a World that gave us: Manos: The Hands of Fate? Eegah? Troll 2? Sharp Teeth? Shark Attack in the Mediterranean? Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild? A Sound of Thunder? Furry Vengeance? Boat Trip? Basic Instinct 2? Good Luck Chuck? Piranha Part Two: The Spawning? Glitter? Remember Me? Stan Helsing? Leonard: Part 6? Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation? All About Steve? Deathbed: The Bed That Eats? Pieces? Paranormal Activity? The Raspberry Reich? Curtains? Axe? Superman IV: The Quest for Peace? Batman & Robin? The Twilight series? Vampires Suck? Any Howling Sequel? Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines? Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan? Jennifer's Body? Plan 9 From Outer Space? 88 Minutes? Beyond a Reasonable Doubt? Lucky You? Jaws: The Revenge? 2012? Empire of the Ants? The Food of the Gods? Jurassic Park III? Halloween III: Season of the Witch? Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers? Halloween: Resurrection? Grown Ups? Year One? The Toxic Avenger? Either I Spit On Your Grave(s)? Blood Beach? The Last Airbender? The Happening? Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare? TV's Viva Laughlin? Saddam Hussein? Paris Hilton? Keanu Reeves?(Okay, those last four weren't movies, but damn you, World, for those.)Well, I had to ask myself: Is this really a movie? Is this a joke and I got the wrong ""film"" that people are talking about?Believe it or not, I had to consult with a professional critic and he actually confirmed that this is, in fact, a movie. And that he's seen it. And then I heard a gunshot and a loud thud. His poor, poor children.While he didn't actually die, you'll want to roughly 10 seconds into The Room. Die laughing, perhaps, at its amazing lack of direction and incredibly, there are two men fighting over the director credit: Wiseau (huh. WISEau?) and Sandy Schklair. Hmmm. Would you have fought with Pilate when he claimed to be the murderer of Jesus?In a ""movie"" (from here on out, that word will be very loosely associated with The Room) that even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed à la Rumble in the Bronx, even though everyone's speaking English – if you can call it that, you'll quickly learn what NOT to do. Such as the ever so comical ""shots"" of San Francisco and the unfortunate Golden Gate Bridge which probably would've asked for a cut if this made more than a tenth of a penny.Recently I re-watched and reviewed the brilliant The Big Lebowski, and I stated towards the end that it should be actually studied in film school, if not already. I'll say the same here, but obviously at the other end of the spectrum.You almost feel sorry for the labeled ""director"" Wiseau, if not for his arrogance – SEE: poster for proof. Ironically, his follow-up was Homeless in America, and if America did have anything to do with it, he would be. But can you really be mad at the guy for this atrocity? Well, if he stayed in the background, and not in more than 75% of screen-time, you might feel some pity.And his writing? It's as if he was a stone-cold foreigner who watched a lot of American Sitcoms of the 1950s and used an English Translating Dictionary to produce the words spoken on screen. Sure, it's hilarious to hear him, or any of them speak, but it's also sad when someone who apparently isn't familiar with the language, culture or modest enough to hire someone to even take a 30-second peek at the screenplay. Personally, I wouldn't jump over to Paris and write a movie on the life and times of the natives using both a French for Dummies guide and my memory of French class in High School nearly two decades back. Is Paris is Burning already taken? Oh.The ""movie"" follows a confused blonde (duh) named Lisa (Danielle) who unsure of her pending nuptials to Johnny (Wiseau.) Who would be when you're about to marry the love child of Gérard Depardieu and Bob Dylan? Soshe sleeps around and shows the camera she's not ashamed of her (probably bought) breasts.That's pretty much the plot. Throw in some laugh-out-loud 15-second subplot of a boy, Denny (Haldiman) who both likes to watch and do daaaangerous narcotics and a mother who looks as confused as George W. Bush without a speech to read.The actors, unbelievably, took this seriously. I would show more compassion for them, but even with a $1,000,000 scholarship to the New York Film Academy, they'd still fail later on.I've been told this is a great midnight movie experience, i.e. the astonishingly superior The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Perhaps. But, even at 99 minutes, it drags and my laughter nearly died, from pure exhaustion, towards the end. Fortunately, the SURPRISE! ending brought me back up to laughing hard.That all said, wellthis entire review, I'd still recommend this ""movie."" How could you miss an opportunity like this? I seriously thought Troll 2 could never ever happen again. Improbably, lightning struck twice. First with a movie that's called Troll 2 that doesn't even involve trolls and now with The Room that's not even about one.",The Room
23,cherold,Fascinatingly inept,1,19 July 2017,"With a movie about the making of The Room coming out, I thought I'd break down and watch it. I cheated and watched it with RiffTrax, though, in case the unintentional comedy aspect failed on me.The movie is a fascinating curio that is inept to a level that is hard to even describe. It's not just the broad strokes, like the inane story or the hanging subplots or the abysmal acting. It's also the moment to moment directorial choices. For example, in a scene involving a loan shark, Lisa gets upset and reacts with over-the-top emotion. But in the cutaways to the actor she's talking to, his emotional tone doesn't jibe and it's not clear they are working from the same script. This is pretty common in the movie.It's not just that director/writer/star Wiseau has no concept of the language of film but that he doesn't seem to understand how people work. He's like a robot who has tried to figure out human interactions and failed abysmally. There is not a moment where anyone does anything a real person would do in the same circumstances. None of the characters make sense, none of the actions make sense. While famous bad-film-director Ed Wood seemed to understand what a movie was supposed to look like, even if he couldn't make it happen, Wiseau appears to have lived alone in a box his entire life.Well, not quite, because one gets the impression that Wiseau is mad at someone he dated. Lisa is basically a psychopath, suggesting that Wiseau thinks women are just plain out to get him. Would this have been funny without RiffTrax? I'm not sure. Some things, like the plentiful, tedious, *endless* sex scenes, are painful even with jokes in the background. Other times I could see where in the right mood I would laugh at the terribleness of it all.Anyway, *with* RiffTrax it's pretty fun, although I thought they were being unfair to the actress playing Lisa, who was undeserving of the body shaming lines.",The Room

25,ElMaruecan82,Stinks So Good!,4,22 December 2017,"(Despite a seemingly 'positive' review, I rated the movie a 4, and for three reasons:quoting ""Tootsie"": 'God forbid it lost its status as a cult failureit's a little nod to Roger Ebert who gave four stars to what he believed were the great movies, the film is indeed bad in a great waywell, the film is bad, isn't it?)I heard and read so many good things about all the bad things in Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room. But if it didn't really encourage me to watch it, I still checked on the 'classic' moments from Youtube and my curiosity was fully satisfied, I knew the main lines and catchphrases and I could see why the film had became such a revered (or reverse) classic, but I didn't care about watching it as much as I didn't care about ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", morbid curiosity is something I lack for that matter.If it wasn't for James Franco's release of ""The Disaster Artist"", an adaptation of Greg Sestero's book chronicling the apparently disastrous making of the film and how an ambitious project turned out to be the ""'best worst movie ever"" made, nothing would have raised my curiosity. I suspect there are many viewers who're going to watch the film before checking on Franco's. It's like a rebirth for Tommy Wiseau and a definite entrance of ""The Room"" as one of these movies known for the wrong reasons, but known nonetheless. The ways of Hollywood are unpredictable and many stinkers have achieved more fame than 'classics'. ""The Room"" is one of them. Paraphrasing a slogan from Eddie Murphy's ""Boomerang"": it stinks so good!To call the film 'bad' is an understatement, you could sum up the story by saying it's about a man who loves a woman or a woman who loves a man, but they're not the same, it's also about a kid who owes money, a thug who wants it badly, a drug deal, a mother who has breast cancer, a girl who wrongfully accuses her fiancé, I mean, future husband of hitting her but he insists he did not... in fact the film is beyond the idea of 'being about something', most of these subplots have no set-ups and no resolutions whatsoever, they just happen without even having a reason to happen, it's like mixing up the idea of cooking with throwing ingredients on a saucepan and waiting for something to ""happen"".There's indeed a sense of anarchic disdain to any screen writing requirement, a succession of bits as random as possible that whether it's intentional or accidental is besides the point, it's bad in a genuinely genius way. And don't get me started on the acting. The film made me believed there are three schools of acting: good acting, bad acting and ""Room"" acting, Tommy Wiseau is a school by himself, he recites his lines as if he had just learn them phonetically, he doesn't look straight in the eyes, his mood changes suddenly, his lines are punctuated by the weirdest laugh ever and start with ""Oh, Hi!"" so many times it'll certainly inspire some drinking games.ButWiseau finds his match in all the actors who act is they've been picked like Homer Simpson when he became the monorail driver. The actors have no experience and just give enough conviction to convey the right ersatz of emotion, but the effect is all the same, it's laughable. You don't laugh because they act bad, but because you know what you're supposed to feel and you're baffled because they don't even try, and I guess that's the film's secret. Indeed, there's a sparkle lighting that movie and making it immune to sheer disdains, it's like we laugh with it but not at it, as it seems unbelievable that none would be aware of how bad it is.""The Room"" rises below the idea of great movie, it's bad but make you care about how bad it is, and not every great film becomes a classic, not every great film inspires a movie about its making, much more, there are so many movies trying to be 'great' and falling flat, it takes some guts to make a film that doesn't even try to be great and succeed gloriously.",The Room
26,bowmanblue,Embrace the bad,7,6 February 2021,"2003's 'The Room' is a difficult film to rate. I'd like to give it 10/10, but, unless you have at least a small understanding of the history of this film, you may be mistaken for saying that it's possibly one of the greatest movies every made, up there with 'The Godfather' and 'Empire Strikes Back.' I can assure you it's not anything like those films. In fact, although I'd still give it top marks, it should be noted that 'The Room' is only top of its own league in some alternate universe.If you've ever watched a film that, deep down, you know isn't actually good - and yet you've taken a fair amount of enjoyment from it anyway, then chances are you occasionally treat yourself to a 'so-bad-it's-good' sort of movie. If you have then you may get something out of this.I would tell you the story, only there isn't really much of one. At best it's a romantic drama about a couple - one of which is having an affair with her future husband's best friend. It all sounds pretty standard stuff for a drama, but it is one film that has to be seen to be believed.It's awful.I literally cannot think of any positive thing to say about it. And yet I loved it. It truly is a carcrash that, if it hooks you, you will be completely unable to look away from. The acting - awful. The sets - bizarrely awful (check out the last scene where the spiral staircase has been boarded up and yet characters are still supposed to be going up and down it). The dialogue - cringeworthy. And the sheer randomness of scenes that don't go anywhere, coupled with new characters who just sort of pop up and then disappear again with no real explanation, all leaves you with more than a few question marks above your head.The irony being that writer/director and (believe it or not!) 'actor' Tommy Wiseau actually thought he was creating something brilliant. However, only after 'The Room's' release did it dawn on him that people were mocking the film as it appeared to top more than a few 'Worst Film Ever' lists.Now 'The Room' is more infamous than famous. It even spawned it's own dramatic 'making of' movie - the excellent - 'Disaster Artist.' If you're into films then you should at least be aware of this film and the tales of how it came about. If you like your 'so-bad-they're-good' films then you'll probably stick with this one. It certainly will leave an impression with you - whether that's a positive or negative will be up to you.",The Room
27,ThomasDrufke,An Enjoyable Abomination,1,8 December 2017,"I don't often say this, but I believe sometime it's important to watch the bad movies so that you can appreciate the good films even more. I had been holding out on watching The Room for a long time, but upon the release of The Disaster Artist, I felt it was the right time to divulge into the madness. And make no mistake, the film does not disappoint. This is easily one of the worst films ever made, if not the worst. But unlike many horrible films I have seen, there's a certain amount of undeniable enjoyment here. I know Tommy Wiseau has come out and said the film was purposefully comedic and should be considered a ""dark comedy"", but there's no way most of this film was this intentionally bad. Either way, there are so many memorably awful and funny things to come out of this. First off, unless it was just my copy of the DVD from the library, but it sure seemed like the words spoken and the timing of the characters mouth's moving were not linked up for most of the film. But that's the only major technical issue I noticed with the movie. Speaking of which, how in god's name did this film cost 6 million dollars to make? There's no action, shouldn't be any special effects, nor green screen scenes (though apparently Wiseau did actually do some of that). Why would this film cost that much? An even better question may be how the heck he came up with 6 million on his own to produce this? At any rate, The Room is one of the most fun mistakes Hollywood has ever produced. I'm already looking at YouTube constantly for these short clips from the film that make absolutely no sense to fulfill my entertainment for that particular moment. It's no wonder why James Franco was able to come up with an entire film worth of ideas and moments to make The Disaster Artist a success.0.5/10(.5 for the mere fact that this film is memorably atrocious)",The Room
28,ericstevenson,You are tearing...oh you get it,1,28 March 2017,"Well, it was fascinating to finally be able to see one of the most notorious bad movies of all time ""The Room"". I don't know how the movie got its name. I mean, I guess there is in fact a room featured, but it's no more featured than any other movie. Anyway, like most bad movies, it suffers from being dreadfully boring. Everything about this movie is so awkward it makes me hate it. I think the most annoying thing is how Johnny keeps making this ""cheep cheep cheep"" noise over and over, imitating a chicken. Wait, isn't that a chick? There are literally three sex scenes in the first half hour of this movie. We do finally get the fourth one near the end. Any film with four sex scenes that isn't a porno deserves to be considered one of the worst films of all time. They're so monotonous and pointless. There's this one scene where a guy tries to kill this one guy which goes nowhere. The characters all get tuxedos so they can...play football? What? It is so dreadfully boring. We see Johnny fight this guy. It stops, but then he does it minutes later. Why is this happening? None of this means anything.This film is dreadfully monotonous to the point where I really just wanted it to end soon but at least I was fortunate enough to download the Rifftrax version for it. It was so hilarious especially with how Disembodio wanted to talk through all the sex scenes. This was a movie that I had to have the Rifftrax audio with, because I knew it would be too horrible for me to do without it. This also ended up being featured in what many people consider to be the Nostalgia Critic's best review. Tommy Wiseau himself didn't like people mocking his movie. He shouldn't have made it so bad.With Rifftrax, I really liked, ""I hate you guy who looks like me!"". Another great one was, ""First, death to all patio furniture!"". There was also, ""I'm not feeling good today"", ""Why?"" with the riff, ""I saw my fiancée naked"". I also loved, ""Another underwear conversation related tragedy!"". Call me immature, but I thought, ""He's being a big baby"" was great with the joke, ""Should see him in his diaper, ow!"". The money is well worth it. 1/2*",The Room

The only reason i picked it up is because of ""The Disaster Artist"" (2017) - an upcoming movie about creation of this ""masterpiece"".""The Room"" is hilariously bad - this is what happens when lead ""artist"" beyond the wheel without any talent tries to create something out of league. If you don't know how - maybe sometimes its better not to do instead of doing and then becoming a joke target for centuries. I do admire that Tommy Wiseau at least tried to so something he was passioned about nevertheless. Overall, there isn't much to say about this movie actually. It is hilariously bad picture, where nothing works, and its done so bad that i kinda watched scene after scene with my eyes wide open in disbelief that it can't be worse that this. This picture is funny in how it is bad, and that is the best one can say about this trashy little picture.",The Room
31,Bored_Dragon,Probably the worst movie I have ever seen in its entirety,2,9 March 2018,"It's hard to describe in words how bad this movie really is. This is one of those things that you must personally experience to believe.

32,ironhorse_iv,"Oh hai. The film is so unintentional funny, that, it's tearing me apart! It's so bad",3,8 December 2015,"This romantic drama film written, directed, produced by Tommy Wiseau is a great example of 'it's so bad, it's good'. Some audiences found the bizarre storytelling, entertaining, despite the film's many various technical and narrative flaws. It got so popular, that film screening parties were set up, for fans of the film to have fun throwing plastic spoons at the film, blurting out the film's dialogue, or tossing footballs around. It's really shocking to see how many people would flock to the theaters, just to partake in it. After all, you don't want to watch this alone, it's dull & boring. It will be a mistake. The downer ending doesn't help. However, I do like the shout-outs references to the older 1940s/1950 films. The film tells the story of a melodramatic love triangle between a good-natured banker, named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), his fiancée Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his conflicted best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero) whom Lisa has secretly been seeing behind Johnny's back. Sadly, this love affair is way drawn-out and its sex scenes are sickening. They don't seem to serve any purpose other than Padding. Worse, according to cast and crew, Tommy had bad body odor issues; because of this, they used clips of the first sex scene in the second sex scene, because the actors refused to do yet another. Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, are numerous subplots involving secondary characters that has little to do with the main plot, such as drug deal goes wrong, tuxedos football playing, new characters appearing, mysterious banking clients, house buying deals, people breaking into Johnny's house to have sex, and a character dealing with breast cancer. Each poorly written subplot receives little to no exposition, and none of them are ever resolved, by the end of the film. Despite the title, 'The Room' makes little sense as a title, because characters are neither trapped in a room. According to the director, the title refers to a person's happy Place, but it makes no sense, since the movie is more about betrayal, anger & depression. The poor written script is also badly characterized by the film's numerous inexplicable mood and personality shifts in characters. Characters within the film, do things, way too irrational. It's like, they were all stupid. Also, much of the dialogue is highly repetitive. In addition to being rife with bad dialogue, the film has some of the worst acting, I have ever, witness. They are so bad, that they undermine the script's intention. A good example of this is how Johnny comes off, very creepily & obsessive rather than the model husband & friend. Tommy's weird European accent is awkward, and stale. It's really odd, how he laughs at really random stuff, such as domestic abuse. I guess, it kinda makes sense, since Wiseau intended for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire. Thank goodness, that subplot was eventually drop, due to budget cuts. Tommy Wiseau was so bad, at remembering his lines that much of his dialogue had to be re-dubbed in postproduction. Sadly, most of it, wasn't even in sync with his lip movements. Juliette Danielle was alright in the film, but her character was made, way too unlikable. For Greg Sestero, he was pretty much, phoning his acting, in. It's funny to hear stories of him, ad lipping, just to make Wiseau angry. Supporting characters are just as bad; such like Denny (Philip Haldiman). His behavior is incredibly creepy and bizarre. Even the director has admitted the character might be mildly retarded. Other characters like Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), Mike (Scott Holmes) & Peter (Kyle Vogt) come across as pointless. Those actors really did suffer, a lot during production. Minnott got heat stroke, while Vogt got a concussion. Really bad luck, but OK acting, but a bit hammy. There are way, too many supporting characters to keep track of. The budget for The Room went really over budget, reaching $6 million, all of which was spent on production and marketing. Wiseau made numerous poor decisions during filming, such as building sets for sequences that could have been filmed on location, purchasing unnecessary equipment, and filming identical scenes multiple times using different sets. They further claims that the film's budget skyrocketed as a result of scenes taking too long to shoot due to Wiseau's inability to properly handle a camera. It must had been a nightmare to produce this film. You can tell, due to really bad editing. A good example is the flower shop scene, which tries to cram in, everything in 30 seconds. Other scenes that didn't work is the rooftop sequences with the bad CGI. Looks so fake. The music didn't help. It incredibly sounds cheesy like R&B softcore porn. The film marketing is also very bizarre. The film was promoted almost exclusively through a single billboard, featuring an image of Wiseau looking like a horror film, serial killer. I wonder, if The Room is unintentional or perhaps intentional portrayal of the awkwardness and social disconnect that Wiseau experiences in his own everyday life? I think he could never fully grasp what qualifies as normal, social behavior, and the movie is his expression of his own frustrations. It would explain, all the homosexual undertones. Anyways, the movie has a film adaptation of the making of this film in the works & a 3D version. Even a Broadway adaptation is tossed around. As of this writing, none of those, have yet been produced. However, a video game of the same name was produced. Overall: The film had many ""admirers'"" calling it a modern Ed Wood type of a masterpiece, due to sincerely attempt of making a great dramatic picture, and falling miserable. In my eyes, I do somewhat agree. I considers it so bad that ""it truly is one of those movies you have to see to believe.",The Room
33,briancham1994,Amateurish,5,4 June 2020,"This film has a reputation for being so bad it's good. I personally didn't find much humour in it, just a constant sense of befuddlement.

34,tomgillespie2002,"See it, hate it, and then love it",2,4 February 2018,"Terrible movies flood our screens every year. Some will make you want to demand your money back or simply tear your eyes from their sockets in a bid to end the suffering, but chances are, once it's finally over, you'll never think about it again. There are plenty of terrible bad movies, but great bad movies - those that truly stick with you - are in an incredibly short supply. There's a real art to creating something so jaw-droppingly bad, so head-scratchingly awful that you start to question your very existence. Tommy Wiseau's The Room, commonly referred to as the Citizen Kane of bad movies, has this art perfected. When the film trickled into selected theatres back in 2003, nobody could have predicted the impact it would have. Nobody, that is, apart from narcissistic writer, director, producer and star Tommy Wiseau.Only Wiseau undoubtedly had visions of being showered with admiration and awards, even timing the film's release to qualify for the Academy Awards. Instead, The Room quickly developed a reputation as a side-show, screened regularly as part of the midnight movie circuit where audience members would shout the movie's memorable catch-phrases and hurl plastic cutlery at the screen. Wiseau has since explained that The Room was always meant to be a black comedy and never intended for it to be taken seriously, but that's about as believable as the director's claims that he was born in America. In fact, nothing about The Room is believable, from the wobbly-looking sets and wooden actors to the stilted dialogue and painfully long sex scenes. When you discover that this actually cost $6 million to make - somehow funded by Wiseau himself - you'll be wondering how the hell it ended up looking like an Australian soap opera.Wiseau plays Johnny, a wealthy banker who seemingly possesses no character flaws. He has the appearance of a weather-beaten vampire with a head full of tar-dunked hair and a voice that resembles Christopher Walken if the King of New York actor was born in Eastern Europe and had suffered a stroke. His ""future wife"" Lisa (Juliette Danielle) has grown bored with Johnny and infatuated with his handsome best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Despite pleas from her mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) to stay with the man who will take care of her financially, Lisa seduces Mark. After a night of drinking, Lisa falsely accuses Johnny of hitting her (""I did not hit her! I did naaaht!""). But being the optimistic, all-round great guy that he is, Johnny doesn't let this get in the way of emotionally supporting his young neighbour Denny (Philip Haldiman), the man-boy orphan who Johnny treats like a son, or to throw on a tuxedo for a game of catch with his buddies.The Room resembles a 100-minute sitcom episode during which one or two sets are visited by a roster of minor characters that in no way resembles real life. Sub-plots, such as Denny landing himself in trouble with a gun-wielding drug dealer or Claudette's revelation that she has cancer, are introduced only to be never discussed again. Rather than exploring the characters by actually giving them something to do other than walk into a room and offer mundane advice, Wiseau would rather give us no fewer than four extended sex scenes, three of which involving the filmmaker's bare arse thrusting against Danielle's stomach. Scenes play out on rooftops and alleyways that are clearly sets with a green-screen backdrop, raising the question of why Wiseau didn't simply shoot on location. But thanks to endless establishing shots of San Francisco landmarks, we know that they're definitely not in a Los Angeles studio. It would be easy to talk about The Room for hours and not even scratch the surface of just how strange yet utterly fascinating it is. See it, hate it, and then love it. And tell your friends to do the same.",The Room
35,Thanos_Alfie,The best worst movie...,1,22 November 2018,"""The Room"" is a Comedy - Drama movie in which we follow a man's life who is a successful banker and lives happily with his fiancée in San Fransisco. After sometime she changes her behavior to him and also tries to seduce his best friend. Everything changes from that point the relationships between them won't be the same again.I have to admit that I watched this movie knowing what is all about so, I was prepared for it. After watching I understood why this movie is considered the best worst movie of all times. The plot is very simple because there is not a plot or connection between the scenes and you have to figure out many things by yourself in order to cover all the plot holes. About the interpretations now, Tommy Wiseau who played as Johnny the successful banker was the worst by far but extremely funny on his role or maybe in his real life too, Greg Sestero who played as Mark the best friend of Johny was equally bad with him and of course Juliette Danielle who played as Lisa, Johny's fiancée was a bit better than them. It has to be mentioned that the direction which was made by Tommy Wiseau who was also the producer of it was simply hilarious because you could not understand what was going on in this movie or why is this so bad.Finally, I have to say that ""The Room"" is a bad movie but if you have a bad day at work etc just watch it and I am sure you are going to laugh a lot and you feel a lot better when it finishes. Don't have high hopes or expectations from this movie and you aren't going to be let down by it, watch it and just laugh.",The Room
36,Floated2,Unique Cult film,7,25 April 2017,"The Room has been highly criticized for several years since it's release in 2003, and has become a cult film among many film fans. The film as a whole is quite unique and lives up to it's hype of ""so bad it's good"". The Room features acting that is noticeably bad as the actors rarely show proper emotion as you can tell as if they don't know what it is they are doing. As well as the dialogue (consisting of ""Oh hi"" and ""my future wife"", along with others)Watching this film as one would know it's not good makes the viewing better. There is a lot of unintentional comedy in this film coming from the characters, the situation and overall chemistry and random unneeded sex scenes. The Room is quite funny in that aspect and is funnier than many recent comedies of the last few years. Although not labeled a comedy and more so a drama, though some claim it as a dark comedy- which makes sense.===
As a rewatch 01/20/18' the Room remains a highly entertaining and unintentionally funny film. Having revisited this film from after watching the Disaster Artist, there is much in which that film did in which we see here in the room. As have already pointed out, this film was meant to be serious but within the characters' acting and overall lines, awkward sex scenes and other bizarre happenings, this film is more content with being a dark comedy. Better on a second viewing with more content of paying attention. For another rewatch 04/28/20' and a couple years later, the Room still holds up as an unintentional dark comedy filled with bizarre scenes, dialogues and an overall aspect which makes it a unique watching experience.",The Room
37,eddie_baggins,A film deserving of its reputation,1,4 December 2017,"I'm really not sure how you even begin to review Tommy Wiseau's 2003 feature film The Room aka the infamous ""Citizen Kane"" of bad movies.A feature that's reputation is now the stuff of movie legend and is being examined on the big screen with James Franco's soon to be released The Disaster Artist, everything I had heard about The Room is absolutely true and it's hard to argue against the fact that this dire relationship drama, filled with background spoons, games of catch and randomly worn tuxedos is one of the worst films to ever receive a proper release.Everything about Wiseau's passion project (that inexcusably cost over $5 million to make) is beyond amateurish.Dialogue is often out of sync, camera's at times aren't even in focus, the acting ensemble deliver performances that should be studied by any potential actor on an example of what not to do, while The Room's actual plot and characters are both incredibly dull, boring and wholly unlikeable.Set almost exclusively in a singular apartment in San Francisco, The Room's plot line that focuses its attention around Wiseau's Johnny relationship with Juliette Danielle's detestable fiancée Lisa, who is in fact cheating on Johnny with his ""best friend"" Mark (played by Greg Sestero who looks incredibly sad to be a part of the film) is so unbelievably dull and pointless that it's hard to know why anyone would've read this script and thought they wanted to be a part of it, other than the fact the idea of a pay-check was too good to pass up.The Room quite literally has one of the most unlikeable ensembles ever seen in a motion picture, with our central trio joined by the likes of Philip Haldiman's creepy Denny and Carolyn Minnott's annoying Claudette to help create a group a people you'd hate to be stuck in a room with, let alone a film that outstays its welcome at just over 90 minutes.This whole bizarre experience however acts as one of the most determined cases of wannabe filmmaking ever seen with Wiseau clearly holding onto his vision throughout the whole process as both a performer and director.From reports it seems as though Wiseau thought he was making some type of epic rumination on love and life, a modern day Tennessee Williams with the powerful drama of a Rebel Without a Cause and to watch Wiseau try and play Johnny while his film crumbles around him is a sight to behold, a train-wreck you can't turn away from (even when Wiseau decides to show off his de-clothed body) and the very personification of someone's dreams crumbling right before your very eyes.Final Say – A film that could be made by a group of high school students for a few hundred dollars, The Room is just unbelievably rough, amateurish and downright hilarious for all the wrong reasons.If The Room was in fact one giant big in-joke then it achieved all it could ever have hoped for, while if it indeed was Wiseau's genuine attempt at making something of power and note, this dire feature deserves its high ranking reputation as one of cinema's greatest ever failures.0 red dresses out of 5",The Room

41,Vartiainen,Fascinatingly bad,1,17 November 2019,"One of the most infamous bad movies there are. They're still showing this in select theaters, a bit like Rocky Horror Picture Show. Not because it's in any way a good movie - it's all things conceivable, but not that - but because it's such a good movie to sit through with your friends and riff on it.The wannabe magnum opus of its director/writer/producer/executive producer/lead actor, Tommy Wiseau, The Room is the story of Johnny (Wiseau), his fiancee, Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and his best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero). It's a story about how Lisa suddenly becomes bored of Johnny and cheats on him with Mark. And all the bizarre and bad things that happen because of it.And when you put it like that, it actually sounds a bit boring. So just what makes this movie so fascinating, and admittedly fun, to watch? The execution. And the fact that Wiseau actually had a budget for this, but had no idea what to do with it. The sets are decent, they use professional cameras and lighting, there's even some green screen utilized. Put this is all used to film one of the most egregious student films there is. The dialogues are laughably wooden, the acting even more so, there's way too many badly filmed sex scenes, there's like a bazillion continuity errors and plot points, it's pretty clear they accidentally cut out some key scenes, and the ending is so over the top melodramatic that it's glorious.A student film, in a nutshell. But one filmed by a man at least in his late thirties. (We actually don't know when Mr. Wiseau was born, or where. There has been speculation. The word extraterrestrial might have been mentioned.)Watching this film is a prolonged exercise in asking the question ""Why!?"" and learning to cope with the fact that there are no answers. And that can be a lot of fun, in a baffling way.Definitely worth watching. Yes, it's bad, but it'd be hard to watch this film without knowing that.

42,jamesrupert2014,"Fascinating in context, unwatchable otherwise",3,28 August 2018,"Few people will have watched this film without first having seen or read ""The Disaster Artist"" (or at least being aware of the story*). Without the context of 'star' Greg Sestero's 'making of' memoirs, ""The Room"" would be challenging to sit through. The film opens like a 'soft core porn' flic (reminding me of Showcase's semi-adult (and almost as unwatchable) ""Red Shoe Diaries"", 1992) but goes nowhere in the erotic department (although starlet Juliette Danielle shows a lot more skin than the film ""The Disaster Artist"" (2017) suggests). After the titillating opening scenes, the movie degenerates into a disjointed, almost plotless, tale of love, betrayal, and footballs. Having seen ""The Disaster Artist"" and read some of the on-line comments, I watched ""The Room"" with rapt attention, waiting for the iconic ""Hi Mark""s, ""best friend""s, neck lumps, BB guns, doggies, and (of course) footballs. This scrutiny doesn't make the movie better, but does make for interesting viewing and gives insights into how much craft must go into making a 'good movie'. Oddly, IMO some scenes might have been excellent in other circumstances (four buddies in rented tuxedos, stressed-out while waiting for a wedding to begin, retreat to an alley for an impromptu game of football could have been a memorable scene in the ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978)). Auteur, star, and bank-roll Tommy Wiseau is as interesting as the film itself and, of all the reviews that I have written on IMDB, this one is the most likely to be read by the reviewed film's director. Lacking the quirky goofiness or bloody excesses of legendary 'bad/cult' movies' (such as ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" (1959), ""Two Thousand Maniacs!"" (1964), or ""The Giant Claw"" (1957)), ""The Room"" would have sunk into the abyss of forgotten movies if not for ""The Disaster Artist"". Now, the film is celebrated as a cult film in its own right and, with one film, Wiseau may have become this generation's Ed Wood. *I think, but there are more than 100 reviews of the film on IMDB that date from before the 2013 publication of Sestero's book.",The Room
43,jadavix,Watch it to feel how Johnny felt,7,24 February 2017,"So many details about ""The Room"" are sketchy. Who the hell is Tommy Wiseau, anyway? You probably already know what he looks and sounds like, and you likely have seen photographs of that extraordinary bill-board in Los Angeles - the one Wiseau paid around $5000 a month to display, and kept it up for five years. But when he first appears in the movie, it's still cause for shock. Wiseau doesn't fit his own movie - but then what movie could he fit? With the long, stringy black hair, baggy suits, weird accent, pallor and weather-beaten features, Wiseau looks like a member of a down-on- their-luck jazz ensemble playing a tugboat in New Orleans. He does not look like he belongs anywhere near the other actors in this movie.And how Wiseau was able to finance it is a question without an answer.If the movie has a theme, it's misogyny. You've heard of the Bechdel test? This movie would fail the reverse of that: the male characters talk constantly about women, how they're ""too smart, too stupid, or just evil"", as the Wiseau character ""Johnny"" says. His fiancée, Lisa, is an apparent psychopath. Her reasons for cheating on Johnny are non-existent; when she says she loves Mark, it's impossible to believe her. And when she fabricates details about Tommy hitting her (yes, his reaction is hilarious) and forces the teetotaler to get drunk, one feels no inclination to examine the character for reasons why. There is no character. It's like someone took the archetype of an attractive woman from every MGTOW activist and tossed it onto the screen.And, when the movie arrives at its predictable conclusion, she cries. Why would such a cold, hard, calculating b-i-t-c-h cry when she has achieved exactly what her earlier scenes convince you she wanted? Ah - there I go again. I'm asking questions of this movie, and anyone who's seen it knows that's a fool's errand. No one in it behaves in any way like actual people would behave, nothing works the way it works in reality, no one says anything you can imagine a person actually saying. The actors are either phoned in, overly grateful, or Tommy Wiseau, who is in a category of his own as one of the worst actors ever committed to celluloid.My one regret is that the movie isn't the so-bad-it's-good, ""Citizen Kane""-of-bad-movies laugh-riot you are hoping for. It's like a very cheap Cinemax morality tale visited by a Martian named Tommy.",The Room
44,kluseba,A movie that will tear you apart,4,3 December 2017,"I've finally discovered this movie because of the release of The Disaster Artist which is about the making of this film and the fact that one of my local cinemas has screened this film for one hundred months in a row.There are movies that are so bad that they are genuinely entertaining like the vivid and weird Samurai Cop. Other films are so bad that they are genuinely horrible and don't have anything going for them like the vapid Hobgoblins. The Room is actually a mixture of both types of bad movies. The first thirty minutes of the film were extremely hard to sit through and basically just consisted of poorly shot soft porn scenes. However, the final hour or so was so absurd with numerous strange subplots and a certain raise in tension that it kept my attention until the end.There are a few elements that I genuinely like. First of all, the camera work isn't too bad if compared to numerous contemporary low budget flicks with shaky camera perspectives. Secondly, Juliette Danielle isn't only nice to look at but has a certain appeal as confused sociopath and careless femme fatale. Thirdly, Tommy Wiseau's acting skills, even though they are wooden, definitely have a memorable and unique touch and aren't like anything I have ever seen in my life. Fourthly, the movie's soundtrack blends in very well. I wouldn't call it great but it serves its purpose in the different scenes.The other elements are so bad that they keep my attention. The acting skills vary from below average to bad. The dialogues are so thin, repetitive and wooden that an average elementary school student could have come up with something more intriguing. The main story could be described in three sentences but takes more than one hour and a half hours to unfold in a painfully slow development. The numerous unnecessary subplots going nowhere are cringe-worthy oddities that turn out being unintentionally memorable. The decorations and settings look cheap, fake and misplaced. The overlong sex scenes look so unreal that they are actually everything but exciting.Among the biggest oddities are the random spoon pictures, the main character's friends making love in his living room for no apparent reason, the emotionless dialogue about breast cancer, the numerous random football scenes and the two fake scenes involving characters tripping and getting injured. My favorite part is however the scene in the flower shop with the overtly quick exchange of senseless dialogue lines. This scene alone shows everything this film is about: a random scene with an unimportant side character, weak acting skills, bland dialogues, ordinary settings and unintentionally funny improvisation.The Room might have several purposes. It shows us how not to make a movie. It's a great party flick to watch with your friends to switch your brains off. It's a welcome distraction from your everyday lives. It's bizarre, goofy and almost surreal in its very unique style. It's a movie you won't ever forget. These are perhaps unintentional accomplishments that most serious films however fail to achieve which is why Tommy Wiseau still deserves some serious respect for his project.Despite its numerous obvious flaws, it's a weird experience you won't forget anytime soon which is exactly why this disaster of a movie became a cult classic. The sad thing is that Tommy Wiseau put so much passion into this project that I would honestly recommend watching this movie over any exchangeable contemporary superhero sequel flooding the world's cinemas. The Room is one of those movies you should have watched once in your lifetime for all the reasons stated above. I'm sure I will watch it again with a bunch of friends after having just discovered this film on my own this week.",The Room
45,Kdosda_Hegen,Unintentionally or intentionally funny and weird drama.,6,11 May 2020,"Everyone makes fun of this movie, some hate it, some love it. Some think it's misunderstood gem, some think it's one of the worst movies of all time. To be fair I do like the premise of this movie, but everything goes so weird, I don't even call it bad, it's just bizzare. Just to name a few interesting unexplained things: Spoon art, weird dialogues, recycled sex scenes, weird acting, the suspicious relationship between Denny and Johnny/Lisa and many many more things.
I do believe this movie is worth watching, it does have some unpredicatable things and for most part it's a very funny and unique film. You should atleast respect the creator as he alone wrote/directed/procuced/starred in this movie at the same time and all was made from his own money, no support. That's a lot of effort and love put into this film.",The Room
46,jfgibson73,Over the top soap opera,2,2 January 2011,"I watched this movie after hearing that it had a cult following as one of the worst movies ever made. In terms of writing and acting, it's up there. The story is basically a lame soap opera, along the lines of a made-for-cable softcore movie. Johnny is engaged to Lisa, and is very much in love with her. Lisa, however, is bored with Johnny and is interested in his best friend. Lisa's mother and friends want her to stay with Johnny for financial security, or at least be honest with him. Lisa instead keeps stringing him along until things come to a head at Johnny's birthday party. After Lisa tells him she's leaving, Johnny shoots himself in the head and we fade out with everyone crying over his body. Much of the unintentional humor comes from the ridiculous dialog, which is sorely repetitive. Tommy Wiseau has a bizarre accent that makes every line he speaks sound like one of the Saturday Night Live comedians doing a Schwarzenegger parody. The whole thing is just so odd and silly, it feels like someone translated the story from a foreign language. Watch it with the Rifftrax commentary--they do a good job with this one.",The Room
47,TOMNEL,"Yeah, this movie is pretty is hilariously bad!",1,2 February 2010,"Director/writer/actor Tommy Wiseau has created quite a movie experience with this. The Room has become a cult hit and now is shown in theaters where people yell and laugh at the movie, and really the unintentional humor is all this thing has going for it. The acting is just awful, especially from Wiseau, the direction is strange, as is the writing and the awful soap opera synth music. Everything about this movie is laughable, so it's good people have realized this, and Mr. WIseau has made a name for himself in the Ed Wood department.Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is a successful banker who is engaged to his ""beautiful"" ""future wife"" Lisa (Juliette Danielle). She is cheating on Johnny for Johnny's well intentioned best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), who knows the whole situation is wrong. Also in the mix is Denny (Phillip Haldiman), a semi-retarded 18 year old who lives in the same apartment as the other characters. He gets into a pickle with a drug dealer. And Lisa's whiny mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) has breast cancer. And Lisa's friend and her boyfriend are making whoopee in Johnny's apartment while they are away. All these great sub-plots...none of which have any outcome on the film. Very strange!Discontinuity is one of the biggest problems with this movie. Many sub-plots are introduced and then immediately dropped, including those mentioned above. Character traits are introduced and then forgotten, like Johnny's dislike for drinking alcohol, which is immediately ignored. Along with scripted discontinuity, there's plenty of bad editing to be found, where characters mouths don't match what they're saying, and where the characters bounce around the screen and inanimate objects move about the room. One character who is never introduced appears and begins yelling at Lisa, and the question pops up, ""Who the heck is this guy?"" But we never get the luxury of knowing his name. All we know is that he must be friends of theirs or something.This movie is also notorious for it's horrible scriptwriting. Every time anybody sees anyone else they always say in a surprised way ""Oh, hi (insert name here)!"" This phrase must be used forty times in the movie. In addition strange and bizarre non-phrases are used, such as the ever popular phrase, ""Leave your stupid comments in your pocket!"" This film is riddled with nonsensical dialogue, and pointless scenes, and that's one thing that makes this such a hilarious film, is it's complete lack of sense.Acting is another aspect that isn't this movie's strong point. Tommy Wiseau is undoubtedly the worst actor in the film, giving a bizarre droopy eyed performance where he not only gives bad readings, but makes some of the ugliest and most stupid faces you could imagine. Greg Sestero is a better actor but still not good. He seems to be a soap opera character, and reading that he has appeared in soap operas that makes sense. Phillip Haldiman's portrayal of Denny is probably second worst in the film. The character is absolutely idiotic and a complete perv, and the acting just makes the character all the more pathetic. Despite this film's weakness (everything about it!), this is really a funny movie if you can appreciate horrible cinema. This thing is just awful start to finish, and it definitely will have you at least smirking through most of it!My rating: BOMB out of ****. 99 mins. R for constant sexuality, language and violence.",The Room

52,Matt_Layden,Oh Hi Mark.,3,21 January 2011,"So, what I took away from this film regarding the plot is this. Johnny is getting married to his girlfriend Lisa, yet she doesn't love him anymore, she has fallen for his best friend Mark. We know they are best friends because every time Mark and Lisa have sex, he says he shouldn't because he's Johnny's best friend, then he proceeds to have sex with Lisa. Everything comes to a climactic halt at Johnny's birthday party and the lies get unraveled. So, for those of you not familiar with the film, let me give you a bit of information regarding the production and the final film itself. Most of the dialogue had to be dubbed, mostly for the lead actor (who is also the writer, director, producer) and most of it is out of sync. All of the cast, never acted before. The actor who plays Mark agreed to play the role 72 hours before filming began. The actor who played Peter, quit the production half way, so a new character was written and given all of Peter's lines. This character is never named, or explained who he is. Now let's look at the subplots, events that happen in the film and the impact they have on the story.Lisa and her mother are discussing the party for Johnny, when Lisa's mother out of the blue says this: ""I got the results of the test back. I definitely have breast cancer."" ""Oh, you'll be fine"" was the response from the daughter. The cancer is never spoken of again. One character shaves his beard and other characters decide to dedicate full conversations to it (to fill up time?). Characters are wearing tuxes and then decide to play some football in the middle of the street. I must have missed why they were wearing the tuxes, wedding rehearsal? Characters randomly drop by the house to see if Johnny or Lisa is home, it doesn't matter if they are or not, they leave a minute later and tell the person who answered the door to tell the person they said hi. Denny, a young boy that Johnny helped get a place and paid for, owes a drug dealer some money. After Johnny and Mark take care of the drug dealer, this is never mentioned again. I have no idea what happened to the drug dealer. Denny also apparently wants to watch Lisa and Johnny have sex. Characters missing halfway through, unexplained. The list goes on and on. The first 20 minutes, there are four sex scenes. One of which uses the same shots from the previous sex scene. One couple decide to go into Johnny and Lisa's house to have sex, the don't live there, but they have easy access. Tommy Wiseau, the creator of the film, claims to have intentionally made a black comedy, this is BS. The film was clearly trying to be a serious drama and it fails at that. The acting, is well, terrible. The mother seemed to be the only one 'trying'. Well, maybe Wiseau was trying, I couldn't tell. His most emotional scene was his tantrum at the end, throwing things around and tearing the house apart. He looked like he was sleepwalking while he was doing it. I suggest playing a drinking game while watching this, with friends, not alone. Take a shot every time someone says ""I don't want to talk about it"", anytime Johnny laughs for no reason, anytime you see a football, anytime roses make an appearance, anytime someone says future wife/husband and of course, anytime something inexplicable happens. You'll be wasted within the first ten minutes.I don't hate the film, I adore it for the absurdity. He tried, failed and is now riding the failing success to the top. The film is considered a cult classic. The 'Citizen Kane' of bad movies and Wiseau is using that to his advantage, smart move. Had he tried to defend the movie, it would have turned into a Showgirls. I wish someone had given me 6 million dollars to make a movie. I would have turned something in better than this. The guy didn't know the difference between 35mm and digital, so he filmed the movie with both cameras side by side. Interesting way to do things, but not showing confidence in your actors there. At least one of them knew what kind of movie it was and split before the film was finished. I would even make a better alley way set. I don't really know what to rate it.",The Room
53,bkrauser-81-311064,"Stands Outside of Time, Space and Good Taste",5,3 April 2016,"The Room is a film directed, written, produced, starring and likely catered by fame-seeker and wannabe cultural icon Tommy Wiseau. Johnny (Wiseau) our Dramamine swilling protagonist is a seemingly perfect human being who lives in San Francisco with his fiancée Lisa (Danielle). He exercises regularly running and playing catch with neighborhood urchin Denny (Haldiman). He also goes to his job to do business stuff. One day, Lisa wakes up realizing she no longer loves Johnny and seduces his best friend Mark (Sestero). All of the couple's mutual friends think Lisa's actions are despicable while Lisa's mother (Minnott) believes Johnny is the key to Lisa's financial security and she shouldn't call off the wedding. That is about as much plot as you can gleam out of this impossibly contrived film which aims for the melodrama of Dallas (1978-1991) but ends up feeling like a two act play written by second graders.The Room is considered one of the worst movies ever made which, after a very brief first life in theaters, has become a midnight screening staple and so- bad-it's-good classic to eye-rolling hipsters and giddy schlock fans. Boasting inept direction, screen writing, cinematography, lighting, acting, special-effects, editing, et al., The Room is essentially a master course of what NOT to do when it comes to film-making. Yet despite the film's almost willful ignorance to straightforward storytelling, the film has an appeal that defies logic. Like watching the hypnotic gaze of an esurient asp, The Room puts you in a trance and forces you to sit through the entire f***ing thing; from it's softcore porn bedroom scenes to it's woman hating living room scenes.I had the pleasure of sitting through this movie among the right crowd and found myself laughing often and hard. The film's artless bubbling; every moment of amateurishness was done in just about the worst way possible allowing the audience to become flabbergasted by it all. Wiseau has said that his biggest influences for The Room were films like Rebel Without a Cause (1955), and the collective works of Elizabeth Taylor, Tennessee Williams and Alfred Hitchcock. In reality the film is more an ugly-looking amalgam of everything an Eastern European immigrant would assume appeals to an American audience including extended moments of alley way football.One would need to watch this affront to celluloid countless times before they can truly discover how a movie like this could be so popular among certain crowds. Perhaps one place to start looking would be Wiseau's absolutely appalling performance as Johnny. Unlike the other ""actors"" that flood the screen, Wiseau doesn't just approach the script with amateurish drudgery. His idiosyncratic delivery, clumsy blocking and confusing chatter reaches new heights in gleeful, over-the-top nuttiness. It feels as if Wiseau was sent from another planet to make a movie as a test to see if they can assimilate. If in the years to come it's discovered there's been a They Live (1988) meets The X-Files (1993-present) season 9 type conspiracy, one would only need to see The Room to discover where it all started.The Room stands outside of time and space and certainly outside of the history of cinema. It's a movie that defies logic; a movie that proves quite entertaining if given the right circumstances but if slightly less overwrought would have been completely forgotten. Wiseau has appeared at many viewings of the film and bolsters his inflated ego as a purposeful disaster artist who revels in sardonic satire. I personally don't believe him for a minute. The frantic, neurotic emotional core of The Room is arguably the only thing about the film that felt genuine. That and two characters' uncomfortable obsession with chocolate. Seriously guys, get a room.",The Room

It's insanely hard not to enjoy something this train-wreck awful.Wiseau plays ""Johnny"", a bank employee who lives in a nice neighborhood in San Francisco with his fiancée Lisa. His best friend is Mark (played by Greg Sestro), and we are reminded that they are best friends about 50 times throughout the film by the wonky dialog. Also living in the building is Denny, who Johnny has more-or-less adopted. Denny is a strange character. He is meant to be an innocent, silly young college student, but the performance and writing turn him into a strange, creepy man who comes off as more of a total sleeze than a good guy. However, when Johnny's girlfriend Lisa begins to cheat on Johnny with Mark, things quickly spiral out of control.That's all I want to give away for this film. But trust me when I say it's a blast to watch!The film is strangely quotable. The abysmal dialog is almost poetic in it's nonsensical-ness. The direction is flat and uninspired, and quite humorous. The acting is hilarious (Wiseau's strange accent and ho-hum attitude makes his character sound like a zombie), and the cinematography is cheap.It really is a textbook example of how not to make a film.Which is where all of the hilarity comes from. This is the sort of movie you pop on while drinking beer with some friends, and meticulously pick apart piece by piece. There is nothing that this film does right, and the chuckles and laughs you will get out of it's incompetence start right away.I love this movie. The film itself gets a 1 out of 10, but the enjoyability gets a 10. Watch this film! Love this film! And be sure to say ""Oh, hai..."" to the Doggy!",The Room
56,Screen_Blitz,"An infamously atrocious cinematic blend with bad acting, bad writing, and overall bad execution spirals into an unusual appetite of ""so bad it's good""",1,8 December 2017,"More often than not, when Hollywood falls into the misfortune of slapping audiences with a bottom-of-the-barrel cinematic atrocity, the final fate is it spirals into obscurity with virtually everyone forgetting about its existence within a matter of a year (maybe less). Then there is rare films such as 'The Room' that succeed at achieving the strange feat of soaking the audiences with laughter for how horrendous it is in quality. That is where Polish-born director Tommy Wiseau (or wherever on Earth he was born, who knows?) and his friend Greg Sestero come in. After a longtime struggle to sell their script to major studios, it was up to this duo to come up with their independent black comedy. The results are something initially unsurprising: a disastrous, slipshod, horribly acted slugfest that spent the following ten years growing an unusual cult status from audiences who relish in laughing at the final product for how wildly inept it is. In short, it is a rare cinematic pain- inducer that everyone is willing to withstand. So the story here follows Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau), a San Francisco banker who is on his way to marrying his long-time girlfriend Lisa (played by Juliette Danielle). What the poor sap doesn't know however, is that Lisa has grown bored of him and decides she is not in love with him and has unexpectedly fell in love with his best friend Mark (played by Greg Sestero). Although Mark is initially reluctant, not wanting to soil his friendship with Johnny), Lisa is too persitent and pulls him into a romance that soon sends everyone's lives in a downward spiral.This film completes the handbook of how not to make a cinematic picture: horrendous acting, despicable excuse of a script, production values that would fit best for a middle school play, and dialogue that is just flat out bad to the core. If you wondering about the story, well, that's pretty much of an eye-roller as well. But Tommy Wiseau's mysterious distortion of artistic value evokes the mystery of how one can make such an atrocity and somehow provide a oddly fresh source of laughter. Wiseau, spending the entirety phoning in a mawkish performance and delivering his lines with total lack of authenticity, puts on the show with his goofy chemistry with Juliette Danielle. But once Lisa's plan to disavow her engagement with Johnny takes action, that is when the unintentional hilarity ensues. Each scene taking a place on the rooftop with the San Francisco, tacked in sloppy green-screen effects, has moments of ""so bad, it's good moments"" spectacle. Nearly every other scene, however, slips into the cracks of ""so inept, it's just bad"". That is not even including Wiseau's braindead way to filming and editing each scene, especially in the overlong sex scenes in which we witness repeated footage of Wiseau's nude back. Secondly, how often do you go to a friend's house and find pictures of silverware in the living room? Now that is just silly. Above all, the events that transpire are too short of substance in terms of execution the point where even the unintentional hilarity factor has difficult to dig up.The Room may indeed fit perfectly in the category one of the worst movies in cinematic history, but in its own special way. Regardless, the level of ridiculousness still falls too shallow to uphold a proper ""good because it's bad"" spectacle. It is more of just plain bad and not enough of funny bad, which is simply disappointing to say the least.",The Room

I don't need to say anything else about this movie. It basically speaks for itself. It's the most notorious indie-drama of the 2000s and it's production resulted in co-star Greg Sestero to write the novel 'The Disaster Artist', chronicling the making of 'The Citizen Kane of Bad Movies'. And now The Disaster Artist is getting its own movie; directed by James Franco, who will also play Tommy Wiseau in the film; additionally, Dave Franco will play Greg Sestero. And The Room actually deserves a movie based around its legacy, because this film has a cult following like no other and a warped-beyond-comprehension fandom that embraces the film's unintentional campiness. Basically, it's an ironic masterpiece that's so bad it's amazing!The movie has dialogue that makes even the worst screen writing seem like the works of Robert Towne and Orson Welles; it's especially funny here because Wiseau actually cites Welles as a massive inspiration on his work. And... Tommy Wiseau has set such an admirably unique low-bar for indie-cinema that its effects on the indie film industry inspired lesser filmmakers to pick up their wits when making their passion projects. If Reservoir Dogs set the bar for quality and smart indie-cinema, then The Room set it for belief- suspending campiness full of WTF moments and nonsensical subplots that would inspire the likes of Birdemic, A Talking Cat and Cool Cat Saves The Kids.

This movie is unlike anything that has come before or will come after; it is a fact you should keep in mind when watching it. And once you've seen it, it is a memorable event you won't forget.
Have you ever seen a movie that is such a masterfully executed work of art it transcends the need for any story, gripping or otherwise? Such movies, however rare, can be found.
Some directors safely follow the proven formula of what makes a great movie; others experiment and take bold approaches with their film-making for equally great results. These are two different ways to produce quality movies.
Tommy Wiseau bet everything he had on this movie; the result is something that can't really be defined within the constraints of a star rating system; it matters not whether you give it one or ten stars and so I literally flipped a coin for this review in the spirit of Tommy's bet on his vision.I will say this: when I first heard about The Room I was told not to watch it alone, but organize my first viewing with a group of like-minded friends and copious amounts of the finest beverage available.

67,joebloggscity,This film was 'tearing me apart' but I still loved it (cult wise),3,17 February 2018,"I guess that unlike all the other reviews I've done on this site, and I've done plenty, this one should be judged on its own niche merits (or lack of them). The Room is an unintentional disaster that makes it a compounded mess of a film that you just can't help love to watch, which is what has created the cult following. It deserves the poor ratings but that doesn't reflect the genuine joy you will actually get from this film, a kind of schadenfreude.To summarise, if you take out any film making textbook and list the key needs for any films, this doesn't fit the bill. The end result is like a trifle without the jelly, using custard not made with eggs, and using pepper instead of the topping sprinkles. It really is that strange. Everything that could be done wrong has been (without intention too).The main aspect that astounds is how the crew were awarded $6m to make this tripe! The lead is vain as hell, being the writer/director/lead 'star' in this absurd movie, yet for all his faults he has some charisma (best admired or humoured with from afar). He can't act, direct or manage. The story has lots of lost strands, the actors aren't even actors it seems, the settings are minimal and woeful, and the whole thing has lots of laughable dialogue (and I've never laughed at love scenes in a film so much in my life!).I watched this recently as part of a cult showing at cinema, with the spoon throwing and quote alongs, and I'd a great time. When you watch it for the first time, you can't but be carried along with the sheer audacity of what is in front of us. Admittedly I'm not sure I'd want to do repeat viewings. The film is ""tearing us apart"", and is carried by the vanity and ineptitude of the lead who is pathetic but cult he is. He's a character and in this day of over managed productions, this is a crazy throwbacks. In fairness, despite the tag, it isn't actually the worst film you'll ever see, there are big budget movies you'll see who are more deserving of that tag.Simply, get some friends, some plastic spoons to throw about and sit & watch this film.

This looked like the first draft of the screenplay with no editing or changes done to it at all. I didn't see any beginning to it, the middle was a turkey while the ending was even more frightening.Even Tom cannot explain the bizarre scenes where the male characters play with the ball? Or why Tom is so fascinated with the bridge? Or why did Tom's character Mark feel that Lisa had not had sex with him for a while when two out of the first three scenes were of their love making (which includes probably the scariest scene in film history: two repeated shots of Tom's butt when he is humping). Or why Lisa isn't happy with Tom? Or why was this movie even made? What annoys me is that Tom Wiseau called this a black comedy, when this movie barely is a film. I cannot really categorize this as a feature film as it does not deserve the recognition. I can only suggest a change – rename it as 'The Party' because the last few shots of the party scene is so memorable in its ineptitude and slipshodness that..

DIY cinema.,1,28 February 2016,"Apparently the aliens from Contact who watch our TV broadcasts and try to find ways to respond to us have been eyeing late night cable drams with ""sin"" or ""temptation"" in the title and this is what they sent back. Or else the kids from the remedial English class got their hands on a camcorder and decided to make an internet sex tape, and the aliens from Contact were watching that...If anybody has a better explanation for how a movie like this, a movie with no conception of human behavior or interactions on any level could exist, I would love to hear it. Even the worst movie makers manage to hit a correct dramatic note every once in a while by sheer statistical accident. But here, the writing and acting manage to fail with such unerring consistency that it is almost an achievement. Words such as 'surreal' do not begin to describe the experience of watching this movie. Its sheer terribleness on every possible creative level exceeds description. If you took ninety minutes of clips from a South American soap opera, spliced them together in random order and got blind street junkies to come with dubbed dialogue, you would still have a more coherent drama. The Room is so totally bad for every moment of its running time that it becomes a master class on cinematic ineptitude. The dialogue is awful, yet the actors still manage to make it seem much worse than it is by mistiming lines and giving inappropriate responses throughout the movie. The pacing of every scene, every exchange, seems off. And despite a reported budget of $6 million (??!) everything looks cheap and hurried, like a film class project that was left to the last minute.The story construction is so inept that almost nothing that happens pushes the story forward, and virtually none of the plot threads get resolved. In fact, most of them are mentioned once and never come up again. Early on, for example, the mother casually discloses that she has cancer, and that is all we ever hear about it. This however is the film's secret virtue. When no plot point is important or connected to anything else in the movie, the viewer is free to play connect the dots.For instance, Johnny's announcement that he failed to get a promotion at his bank shows his underachievement in the financial world. As financiers are sometimes called 'big swinging d*cks', this could be hinting that Johnny is underachieving anatomically as well. This would explain Lisa' perpetual dissatisfaction with him. Or perhaps Lisa' attitude is actually outwardly redirected self-loathing over all of the Weight Watchers meetings she has been missing. Mark's perpetual surprise over how Lisa's undressing indicates that she wants sex and not something else could be masking his own disappointment that she wasn't handing him her clothes to put on for some cross dressing role play. Such disappointment would go far in explaining the sternness of Mark's resistance to her chubby charms. Danny's drug purchase explains his apparent disconnection from reality throughout the film. The kid is clearly on goofballs. Has the mother's cancer spread to her brain? Memory impairment might explain why she keeps having the same conversations over and over. These are all ripe food for thought, and The Room's arthritic pacing gives the viewer plenty of opportunities to toss them around like footballs thrown by guys in tuxedos.",The Room

In this case he had the bad luck that it sank him.Actually I do not know if it's a scary movie or a drama or a madness. I do not know what the director would want. It gives me more that it is a drama, but the fact is that when the moment arrives at the door, it is not scary and it seems strange to me that everything suddenly becomes so crazy.The actors are like everyone in their world, they are not on par, some crazy others, but of course that can not be.The photograph, I was seeing it and I was imagining the colorist with the program saturating with white. For my taste it has happened, but I've seen that in so many films that are not named as the worst in history.The address, I do not like it, but it does not seem like the worst I've seen.

Usually, in such bad films, they include sex scenes for attracting viewers and that works in the case of most B movies. A significant achievement of The Room must be the multiple sex scenes that aren't remotely arousing even with enough nudity.

No. Definitely NOT a masterpiece. Cult favorite? Okay, that I would buy.When Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero couldn't make it big in movies, they decided to make their own. What Wiseau set out to do was create a masterpiece. What he gave to the world is the worst movie to ever be shown on the silver screen. Yeah ... it was really THAT bad. There is no logical flow, terrible acting (if you can even call it that), contradictions in nearly every scene, unanswered questions, and god awful dialogue - this film was so embarrassingly horrible, that you can't help but laugh at its outrageousness. The more dramatic it tried to be, the harder I laughed.This movie is a paradox, a rarity in terms.

From the moment he started speaking, you know that he has no idea how to act, but he still goes with it and it's a masterpiece of failure.I would go on about this, but I don't need to, everyone has gone about it.

The temptation to comprehend the mind of the director is overwhelming in good entertainment, or the aforementioned accomplished directors who turn out crap, but it's almost overpowering in this film. This isn't a film, it's a peek inside the mind of a mysterious man who has a very complicated view of the world; on that basis alone it should be feted. This is art in its purest form, unencumbered by convention, preconceived notions, propriety, morality, or continuity. And the fact that the incompetence appears unintentional makes the experience of watching it all the more worthwhile.

But, is it still worth watching?",1,30 December 2019,"""The Room"" (2003), oh boy..... Where in the world do I begin? This ""movie"" has found a spot on my list of the top 10 worst films I have ever seen. Boring and confused storyline, dreadful acting, cheap special effects, dull sets/locations, and a predictable generic soundtrack. The story is actually based off a novel written by Tommy Wiseau, who is responsible for the existence of this ""movie"". He couldn't get the book published. Huh, I wonder why? So, he resorted to getting his novel made into this train wreck, oop, I mean, ""movie"". If the ""film"" is any indication to how the novel is laid out, then we can see why no one would help him get his book published. The story is basically a love triangle between main character Johnny, his fiancee Lisa, and friend Mark. Now at first glance, that just sounds like your typical every day love triangle plot. But I assure you, it's a lot more than that. A lot more than that! This ""movie"" is littered with subplots that don't add up, additional characters that contribute nothing to the story, so on and so forth. I guess Tommy Wiseau is a big Zack Snyder fan; who is the true king of unresolved subplots! If it wasn't for the unnecessary plot holes, then the story would have somewhat of an impact. Even though it's your typical love triangle story told over 1,000 times before. Another thing, just look at the ""movie"" poster, it looks like a poster made for a horror movie. Since when was ""The Room"" ever remotely classified to be a horror film?! As far as the acting goes, it's just as abysmal as the storyline. Tommy Wiseau is, by far, the worst actor in this ""movie"". The rest of the actors are just as bad as well, maybe Tommy Wiseau's presence just rubbed off on them? In this ""movie"", he plays the main character, named Johnny. But that's not all he does for this ""film"". He also wrote, produced, executive produced, and yes, directed this ""film"". Every other actor ranges from just plain bad, to lackluster. However, there are two actors who do look like they're actually trying. Greg Sestero as Mark doesn't do that bad, but he's still substandard. There is one actor who puts on a great performance, Dan Janjigian as Chris-R. He is, without question, the best actor in this ""film"". Ironically, he wasn't even a professional actor at that time! He never had any training to be an actor, just wrap your head around that. The person with no acting experience puts on a better performance than everyone else. Something doesn't seem right there! The special effects are just as cheap and generic as you would expect. Honestly, I've seen better effects in movies made back in the 1950's! The sets/locations are dull and boring, and you can tell that the majority of the scenes were filmed in a studio! But, the exterior scenes aren't too bad, as it's filmed in San Francisco. All of the exterior shots of the city are the true saving graces for this ""movie"", but even those can actually get repetitive. They somehow made California boring! How is that possible?! Finally, we have a boring and cliched soundtrack to tie this diarrhea stain together. Not only is the soundtrack lazily edited, but it's just boring. The only part of the score I remember is the opening credits theme. I'm sensing a pattern here, that some of the worst movies have the best opening sequences, in order to try and fool the audience that it's going to be a good movie. Yes, I do understand that all movies need a strong opening to give a good first impression. But they seem to always forget, the rest of the movie has to be good as well! ""The Room"" is truly, the epitome of how not to make a movie. It should be required viewing for film students in college, so they can learn the basics on how not to make a movie, to avoid ruining the future of cinema! There is nothing positive I can salvage from this waste of film making. I'm giving this ""film"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. If I could rate it 0 stars I would, but 1 is as low as I can go. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, my true rating is 0 stars. To end my review, I'm going to just say this. I know you'll think I'm crazy, but ""The Room"" is seriously worth checking out, it is one of those bad movies that you have to see to believe. You will not believe your eyes, it's so bad, that it's surprisingly kind of good! It has gained a cult following, and it is popular for all the wrong reasons. If you're going to watch ""The Room"", I suggest watching it with someone else. Then, it'll be much more fun to laugh at!

87,patches89,ONE OF THE WORST!!!,1,9 May 2021,"This film is lauded as a masterpiece in so bad its good, in fact its just plain bad. Poor writing, poor acting and just a generally poor story.

88,luke-a-mcgowan,A narcissistic travesty and EVERYONE should see it.,1,12 May 2015,"What can you say about The Room? Tommy Wiseau's anti-masterpiece is one of the best things I have ever seen. Not for mundane reasons such as quality acting, the written word, clever cinematography or engaging story. Rather, The Room is one of the most unintentionally hilarious and stupid films that I cannot recommend enough.The film really does revolve around Tommy Wiseau. He looks like a melted wax sculpture of Ozzie Osborne, and has the acting talent to match. He wrote the screenplay, but doesn't understand his own words when delivering them. He focuses on completely irrelevant material both as a director and as a writer - see the infamous football scene and the dramatic close-up of Mark's clean shaven face. Their importance is something we will just never know. As a director, Wiseau has no idea how to construct a scene. Characters just show up in places they have no reason to be. The confrontation with Chris-R on the rooftop has most of the main cast either arriving during the fight or apparently already there! How did Claudette and Lisa get to the top of the building, and why did it take so long for them to react? What made Tommy and Mark climb the building? In fact, why on earth was the confrontation on the roof to begin with? The screenplay has to be the most heinous thing I've ever listened to and I love it for that. Johnny bursts into ""cheep cheep"" noises at random opportunities, characters weave in and out of importance (Steven and Peter being the real examples) and around a half dozen subplots go unresolved. Mark's character changes between scenes - he has more personalities in his own body than the rest of the cast together. The real corker are some of the film's lines, which are more memorable than half of the Academy Award for Best Screenplay winners could produce put together. See below: - ""No I can't, anyway, how's your sex life?"" - ""Chocolate is the symbol of love"" - ""I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode"" - ""You betrayed me! You're not good. You, you're just a chicken. Chip-chip-chip-chip-cheep- cheep."" - Lisa: Did you get your promotion? Johnny: Nah. (pause) Lisa: You didn't get it, did you? - I have to go see Michelle in a little bit to make out with her.The acting, well Tommy Wiseau aside, there's still nothing special here. One might be forgiven for suspecting another is watching porn when they are in fact watching the room. The only way you could really tell is by how fake the sex scenes look (though not for lack of nudity). Juliette Daniel and Greg Sestero really do just do what Wiseau tells them, even where it makes no sense. Phillip Haldiman is creepy but not Matt Damon (The Talented Mr. Ripley) or Paul Dano (Prisoners) creepy, just weird. I have to take a moment here to praise Carolyn Minnott. Not only is she clearly the most talented actress of the bunch, she bites off Wiseau's dreadful words. At one point she demands of Daniel ""Why bring it up if you don't want to talk about it?"" A large part of me feels that Minnott expresses her frustration with this dreadful production through this line, which is fantastic. The Room is a truly delightful display of narcissism on Tommy Wiseau's behalf. Everything seeks to show Johnny as a saint, even if it feels more forced than constipation. Its truly the worst movie ever made, and I love it.",The Room

This movie, on the other hand, must be seen . . . in order to be believed.A more appropriate title for this film should be ""Murphy's Film"", because everything that could possibly go wrong with a movie did go wrong with this one. I suppose a light didn't fall on a cast member while filming, but that's not a compliment to give to any film.""The Room"" could be the worst film ever made for a variety of reasons that feels like a grocery list. The story feels ripped from the most basic soap opera, there are subplots that are out of place and go nowhere, the dialogue is terrible, the actors in the film either underact or overact, there are too many shots that are out of focus, there are unnecessary sex scenes that drag the pace of the story . . . I could go on.As a matter of fact, the basic plot of ""The Room"" can be described in one sentence, whereas all the things that are wrong with the film can fill a book. It should be shown in film school to show students how NOT to make a movie.Tommy Wiseau, a man of unknown origin whose accent sounds Austrian (I guess), starred in, co-produced, directed, and wrote this film on a $6 million budget. He shot it using a 35 mm camera and an HD digital camera simultaneously, reportedly not knowing the difference between the two.Also alleged is his financing for the film, which Wiseau claims he did by taking leather jackets he mysteriously acquired from North Korea and selling them for a profit. That explanation seems more plausible than actually convincing someone to put money down to finance a script already so weak.What results is a film that is just a mess in virtually every aspect. The main story, should you care, involves ad executive Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) and his frustrations with his fiancé Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Johnny is oblivious to her having an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sustero), but notices how distant she has become. Wiseau even goes as far as to vent his frustration by channeling James Dean when he shouts, ""You are tearing me apart, Lisa!"".The subplots that go nowhere include a creepy college student named Denny (Philip Haldiman) who likes to watch Johnny and Lisa have sex (and actually tells them so!), Denny's borrowing money from a drug dealer which he can't pay back, Lisa's mother Claudette (Carolyn Minnott) revealing she has breast cancer, and a pointless game of football in tuxedos. These scenes come and go so often, that you wonder why they were there in the first place.Why, then, am I recommending the film? I went to a midnight showing of it at the Coolidge Corner Theater in Brookline, Massachusetts, and had the time of my life. Similar to watching a midnight showing of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", fans brought plastic spoons and footballs to throw around during crucial parts of the screening, and shouted out responses to the dense dialogue like it was ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" times 1000.The film is available on DVD, but like many films famous for their midnight showings, including ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"", ""The Room"" has to be seen in one of these public screenings. It is no fun sitting at home alone watching a film like this one.I hate using the hackneyed phrase ""It's so bad, it's good"" for that reason: it's so overused. I won't give ""The Room"" credit for being good, because it's not. It's just very fun to watch, and I urge whoever reads this to find a movie theater that screens midnight showings in the nearest city and get tickets for this film if you can. It is terrible, but so worth checking out.",The Room

This is mainly because I didn't use to think it could be possible for a film to so astronomically awful to the point that it becomes entertaining. But, good god almighty, here we are. This film is hilarious and an absolute joy to watch, and not at all for the reasons you may think. Just imagine your favorite movie, but with every redeeming quality absent. Then, take that and add some terrible things to it that would never remotely work in a normal film. After all that, you've got this film, which is anything but a normal film. It's almost a work of art. The hilariously awful acting, the blander than a saltines cracker story, the terrible setup, awful production, and a script that is so brainless, that it gives Patrick Star a run for his money, all make this film an absolute train wreck in every way. But, the beautiful thing is how entertaining this all is. This film fails at everything so hard and so violently, that it's damn near impossible not to laugh at it, and have a good time. For that, this film is an easy recommendation to anyone who wants a good laugh, as the amount of absolute garbage there is in this film will ensue that and then some. This film is really is something special. Just don't expect to look at a football the same way again after seeing this film. Besides that, this is still a legendary release that'll live on as one of the best worst films of all time, even if the legendary status isn't quite for the right reasons. Still, though.

I didn't give it more than 8 because it still has a couple of slow moments, but I still had a smile on my cheek or laughed throughout the majority of the thing. This man had no idea what he was doing. Terrible dialogue, poorly written characters and even small details which just puzzle you.

Unfortunately all the noise was too much for a friend of mine, but the rest of us in the audience nearly lost our voices shouting at the screen for the duration of the film.This may be an oxymoron, but everything I love about the film is everything I hate about the film. Maybe I shouldn't use the word hate, because the fact that this film is so terrible does not give me a negative attitude for the movie - it makes me laugh at how ridiculous of a guy Tommy Wiseau really is. The writing is so atrocious it makes us want to keep quoting it and laughing at it. Such favorite lines among fans include ""Keep your stupid comments in your pocket!,"" ""Anyway, how's your sex life?,"" and of course, ""YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA!""The best part about this film is that Tommy Wiseau gives a terrible performance and acts as though he doesn't understand the lines, which HE wrote! He doesn't sound like a normal human being having a conversation, but he wrote his own part as this average citizen and a caretaker of Denny (who he kept saying was retarded at the event I went to) so you'd imagine he'd talk like an average American. Well guess what, Tommy is far from the average American himself, so how could his character come across as an average guy? Wiseau is like the only real-life cartoon character I have ever met, which is why this film turns out to be so hilarious!If you watch this film, watch it with at least a few friends - a large group of friends would be better.

102,RhapsodyReviews,"Great, But Horrid.",1,17 November 2019,"Review:
'The Room' is a romantic-drama film directed by Tommy Wiseau.
When people think of a movie that is so bad, but still feels the need to tell other to watch it, it's this movie. If you can enjoy a film that's so bad it's good, then give this movie a watch; you won't regret it. I actually had to take breaks between the scenes because I was laughing so hard at how awful it was.
The film centers on a melodramatic love triangle between amiable banker Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), his deceptive fiancée Lisa (Juliette Danielle) and his conflicted best friend Mark (Greg Sestero).
Nobody in this movie is known today for other projects aside from this. Not one person in this movie was good, but Tommy Wiseau is on a whole other level of bad. Not only does his dialogue not make sense in the scenes he is in, but his facial expression and tone don't make what he is saying.
What make the Room superior to all of the 'so bad it's good' films is the fact that it's a riot. You see unlike other films that have 1-2 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the Room is a non-stop extravaganza. Literally every scene has something wrong.
Overall, the fact that ""The Room"" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.

103,hunter-friesen,The absolute worst movie ever made (but it's still enjoyable to watch),1,7 March 2018,"This is one of the hardest films to review. On one side, this is one of the worst films of all time, no doubt about it. But on the other, it's somewhat enjoyable to watch because of how hard everybody fails. I review films based on their quality and what they were trying to accomplish, so this review will treat this film just like any other. So get ready to read a nonstop list of how much this film sucks. The barely coherent plot starts out in San Francisco and follows our main character, Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), as he tries to please his ""future wife"" Lisa (Juliette Danielle) who is having doubts about their relationship. Johnny is as ""all American guy"" who loves freedom, football, and fun. Accompanying Johnny from time to time and filling the story with so many needless subplots are his best friends Mark (Greg Sestero), Denny (Philip Haldiman), and Peter (Kyle Vogt). All I'm going to say is that stuff happens throughout, but it's so stupid that nobody cares.Tommy Wiseau fills in as the star, director, writer, and producer for his passion project. It's good that he took on so many roles because it saved a couple of people the embarrassment of being a part of this film. The writing, pacing, and just about everything about this film could have been done better by a twelve-year-old. We end up watching softcore porn for the first twenty minutes of the film as three different sex scenes occur right after another, each one filled the worst R&B music ever. Characters appear in scenes for no reason and some characters just show up without a name or relationship to anyone else. It feels as if some random people got lost and accidentally ended up in the shot. The absolute weirdest thing about this film is that it is 99 minutes long and barely has enough content to fill a poorly written short. Scenes are needlessly overlong and subplots are added for no purpose or resolution.One could say that this film has an uplifting message for all film students out there. Tommy Wiseau was a passionate man who simply wanted to make a film, and with a script, he wrote himself and $6 million (seriously) he made The Room. If Wiseau can follow through with his dream and make the worst movie ever, then anybody can make their dreams come true. The acting in this movie is the best part about it but, just like everything else, for all the wrong reasons. Tommy Wiseau claims he wanted to channel James Dean in his performance, which is somewhat evident. The only problem is that Dean was a great actor and Wiseau is not. Tommy can't speak lower than a yell and can't speak English well enough to deliver a sentence. Greg Sestero, Tommy's on screen and real-life best friend also had a dream of being on the big screen. The good thing for him as is that he accomplished his dream, and he'll never have another chance to repeat it. He's bad, but he can say he's not the worst in the group. That honor goes to Juliette Danielle who probably says the same three lines of dialogue, with slight variations from time to time. With the release of The Disaster Artist and the cult status The Room has achieved over the years, I would recommend this film for anyone who feels like they don't have what it takes to make it into the film industry. After watching this, you'll be inspired to make your own film. And hey, even if you fail, you'll know you didn't fail as hard as Tommy Wiseau and his small group of wannabe stars.",The Room

I am also not doing a Pros and Cons at the end because there is no point.The plot has many subplots that aren't addressed throughout the course of the film, the characters have constant personality changes as the film progresses on and the acting is atrocious. All in all, the film is entertaining much like Sharknado. The amount of plot holes are tremendous. Tommy Wiseau, Greg Sestero, and Juliette Danielle deliver some of the worst performances Hollywood has ever seen. The acting is inconsistent and always sounds scripted and is always overacted.The pacing is slow and for a film that is an hour and thirty-nine minutes long, it's an hour and thirty-eight minutes too long.Sadly, the film is hilarious to watch and is probably one of the mist entertain movies I have ever seen because it is loaded with material.Overall Rating: 3.2

But unlike ROCKY HORROR (which despite bombing in its initial release, has some high quality in both acting and songs/dancing and remains relevant to this day), THE ROOM is a certifiable piece of crap from the opening scene to the bitter end. And also unlike ROCKY HORROR, I really doubt the main actors of THE ROOM will still have any sort of show-biz careers in the near future, let alone 35 years later.But I had to see it, if for nothing else see just what was behind the creepy Tommy Wiseau ""mug shot"" used in on the cover, which of course was prominently displayed on an L.A. billboard for several years. I did make it through to end, but it sure helped to be reading snarky reviews of it on IMDb while the train wreck was playing. And the fact Wiseau seems to have worse skin than Andy Warhol did, and felt compelled to give us a ""full-backal"" view of said skin, made it all the more hilarious. And for the unintentional comedy, I'm ""awarding"" it an extra star in my rating.I guess my only recommendation is, if you must see THE ROOM, check it out at a midnight ""participation screening"".

113,PassPopcorn,Pass the Popcorn review,2,22 March 2013,"If we had to choose the king of trash movies, that title would probably go to The Room. It's so horrible you can't help but love it. And just wait till you hear some background information! Tommy Wiseau apparently financed this movie by selling leather jackets imported from Korea. An actor decided to leave the crew while filming, so they picked another person to finish shooting his scenes; because of that, we have two completely different people playing the same character. Doesn't this sound promising? The Room tells us about the life of Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), a successful banker who lives with his soon-to-be wife Lisa (Juliette Danielle), has many friends and is loved by everyone. Unfortunately, his girlfriend doesn't love him any more and is having an affair with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestero), who is constantly battled between his desire to be with Lisa and not wanting to hurt Johnny.Everybody agrees that nothing about this movie works. The story is recycled, the acting is bad and the cinematography is not worth mentioning. Certain scenes and characters are put into the movie for no apparent reason, except for making it last longer. The dialogue is repetitive and predictable. I guess you're supposed to sympathise with Johnny, because he's such a good, naive person being betrayed by the two people he loves the most – but you don't, because all the feelings in this movie are just words. But, after you get over the first minutes of confusion in the beginning, The Room is guaranteed to make you laugh really hard.Besides, this movie is a cult. Who could possibly forget the roof scene, in which Johnny talks to himself and later realises Mark is also present? The famous phrase ""oh hi Mark"" is used in this scene. Or all those inexplicable random football tossings, that once happened while the characters were in tuxedos? And of course, the flower shop, one of the most confusingly useless scenes in movie history. All this can be pretty frustrating to watch, but you shouldn't take it too seriously. If you don't, at the end you might even want to see it again sometime, maybe just to have a few good laughs and to remind yourself that it can always be worse – you could have been born as Tommy Wiseau!

Every person I talk to and tell them about this movie as I have a big signed poster in my room thinks that I'm describing an adult movie about it. So much strange stuff happens in this movie you become drawn, infatuated trying to understand Tommy's mindset and why he decided to do certain scenes. All I can say without ruining anything is read Greg's book it explains some of it and you'll have a lot of good laughs.",The Room
117,AgustinCesaratti,It's so bad that its actually really good,10,7 October 2019,God! Help me!I will keep it simple. It's the worst movie I've ever seen but its so grotesque that is actually funny.,The Room
118,Field78,"Murphy's Law in full effect: everything that could go wrong, went wrong",1,5 January 2018,"It's hard to add anything new to a movie that has been described as possibly the best worst movie ever made. It has been said to resemble a depiction of humanity as done by an alien who watched only 24 hours of our television, while others praise it as the best unintentional comedy ever made. Whatever the case may be, everyone who has ever used the term 'worst movie ever' on Godzilla, Waterworld or a Star Wars prequel/sequel should be forced to watch this movie and reconsider. Opinions vary on whether The Room is retrospectively brilliant in that it stumbled upon important themes of friendship, fate and betrayal, but it is generally agreed upon that its merits, bad or good, actively contribute to the fun of watching it. There's no better proof that entertainment can be independent of quality than this movie.In the amusing 'making of' movie The Disaster Artist, it is postulated that writer/actor/producer/director Tommy Wiseau survived a major accident years before he started his magnum opus that is The Room. I am extremely curious to know if this is what happened in real life, because it would explain a lot. As a student I learned that paintings and drawings made by patients with mental disorders could often be used to perfectly exemplify what their ailments were. If this comparison extends to all art in general, including film, then The Room is a look into an extremely fractured mind. This should be mandatory viewing for every medical student who ever considers neurology as a major.Because let's not fool ourselves: this must be the most disjointed and inconsequential movie ever made. Wiseau claims to have wanted to make a movie about 'human nature', and it looks like he decided to go through every type of human action and feeling imaginable in a mere 90 minutes, without any narrative, logical or dramatic cohesion. Normally, a plot is a course of events where one occurrance initiates another, but most of what happens in The Room is a non-sequitur. Of all the misery, joy and ill-defined stuff that happens over the duration of this movie, only a fraction seems to have any long-lasting effect on the plot or characters in one way or another. Drugs, disease, arguments, violence, love, sex and alcohol all pass by for the sake of human drama, characters come and go, but they are often forgotten by the next scene (or even in the same scene), to be never mentioned again or no longer be of significance. You could effectively edit out the entire second act without any negative bearing on the film's final act. This is the kind of film in which people don't seem to be doing anything, yet they claim to be busy; where mothers in 2003 still urge their daughters to marry for financial stability rather than love; where one of the actors was no longer available, so they gave his lines to a completely new character without any introduction, and where there is always time for a game of football without any symbolic or metaphorical meaning. The royal amount of sex scenes almost begs a comparison with a lot of soft-porn B-movies from a decade before, but even those had better writing, acting and directing. As hard as it is to believe, there was even supposed to be a subplot about vampires that didn't make it. Too bad, because it would have made this movie brilliant in its failure over multiple movie genres.Coupled with his complete lack of talent in telling a story, Wiseau doesn't seem to understand what natural dialogue sounds like. Almost all conversations contain something ridiculous, overblown, pompous, inappropriate or nonsensical. Much of the movie's cult appeal comes from endless repetitions, e.g. that Lisa looks beautiful, Johnny and Mark are best friends, the world is treacherous and people don't want to talk about stuff. But the true gold is in such classic quotes like ""Oh hi, Mark!"", ""You are tearing me apart!"" or ""Why? Why is this happening to me?"" Granted, it doesn't help that there is hardly a decent actor in this film, but the bad script and even worse directing of the actors gives them very little to work with. Everybody seems to be going through a mood swing every two lines, and displays at least 10 different states of mind over the course of the film. Characters constantly contradict themselves or seem to have an extremely short-term memory. If there is one positive thing I can say about this movie, it is that the only things sillier than the acting and dialogues are the cheesy lyrics to the songs that accompany the gratuitious and protracted sex scenes (such as the text ""you are my rose"" endlessly repeated).The only job where Wiseau fails even worse than as a writer or director is as an actor. The cult value of his portrayal cannot be overstated. He almost looks and sounds like a heavily drugged and sedated combination of Gru from Despicable Me with Loki from Thor, who is trying to impersonate Pauly Shore. It has to be seen to be believed. His final scene and the movie's finale is the stuff of talentless overacting legends. If you haven't rolled off the couch by then, you'll never will.In conclusion, it is quite irrelevant to say that as a film, The Room makes every mistake in the book and is the most unlikely culmination of bad decisions that may have ever been made, since this is exactly the reason for what makes it so alluring. You can have discussions about guilty pleasures, but as long as there is no concensus on what constitutes great art, those won't be very meaningful. If cabinets made from wreckage and dresses made from meat can be forms of art, why not this dubious cinematographic experiment? Something so uniquely bad comes by only once in a generation. So is The Room a good movie? Not by a long shot. Does it make for interesting art? That's the idea.",The Room
119,jimel98,Best Crap EVER!,10,24 March 2014,"This is a horrible movie, made badly, acted badly, written badly. The plot is dead on, but sub-plots seem to be thrown in for totally unknown reasons and then abandoned. Mr. Wiseau is a LOUSY film maker but I'm guessing a pretty decent business man since he is trying to capitalize on the cult following by trying to convince people (and the simple minded just might buy it)that his intention was to make a comedy (he has a website selling merchandise!). Sorry, those who got a 6 or better on their SATs will never buy it. It's, pretty much as everyone else has said, such a horrible movie, it's GREAT! I loved it and that queasy feeling I got at the beginning of watching this movie with my son (Who is a HUGE fan of bad cinema) went away once I really started to laugh.There are well over 300 reviews, so mine will get lost in the shuffle. My main concern is coming to the defense of Ms. Juliette Danielle. She's not a great actress (though with better material, I have faith she'll be pretty good!) but I have to vehemently disagree with all those who don't find her attractive. Beauty is judged differently by us all, and personally, I think she's adorable. In fact I spent most of the movie wondering just why in hell such a cutie would have ever fallen for a guy who looks 20 years older and near death in the first place. Go figure.In conclusion, I hope this talentless hack, Tommy Wiseau NEVER makes another movie because next time, he'll TRY to make it funny, and it'll fall flat on it's face. Then again, this is a free country, do what you must.*In the above review I mentioned that Tommy Wiseau might try to make an actual comedy and it would fail. HE DID and IT DID! If you like hysterically bad crap, find ""The Neighbors"" somewhere. You'll laugh like hell, but NOT for the right reasons, or should I say, the reasons he WANTS you to laugh, just for the reasons it's legitimately funny. It's worse than ""The Room"" and funnier.",The Room

To score it a 10 is a joke that was maybe funny the first time someone rated a bad movie a 10, but damn talk about a played out joke. It's sorda like voting for the nerdiest kid in school for Homecoming King, whereas even if you had enough people to go along to pull it off, it's a joke that's not really funny? But since there aren't enough people going along with it, you end up with a dreadfully bad movie averaging out to a score of 4, which is almost as confusing as to how such a movie came to be in the first place.",The Room
121,pcrprimer,Cult classic that delivers as one of the best worst movies,8,1 July 2014,"I heard of The Room many years ago, but have never gotten around to watching it until now. This movie is not only bad in terms of acting and storyline, but there are regular inconsistencies and technical problems that range from blurry picture to a terrible green screen. It seems that the cast has risen out of obscurity due to the cult following, and they are milking their 15 seconds of fame. I don't blame them. If I were to list the problems with the movie, I'm sure I would go over the maximum review length. Needless to say, this is a head-scratchingly bad movie that is thoroughly enjoyable as you wonder who would put this much effort into something this bad. If you've already watched the movie, cheep-cheep- cheep. If you haven't, watch it and you will laugh.",The Room
122,Jimmy-128,"The joke wears off. And fairly quickly, too.",1,23 February 2015,"Ten-plus years since its release, it's safe to say that ""The Room"", conceived, written, directed, and produced by lead actor Tommy Wiseau, has become a phenomenon. Making less in its initial release than your average paralegal rakes in on one paycheck--*after* taxes--The Room has become the Rocky Horror Picture Show of its generation, with midnight screenings and various rituals enacted by its fans. Numerous online critics, including the Nostalgia Critic, CinemaSins, and Obscurus Lupa, have had a merry time taking the movie apart--oh, sorry, *TEARING THE MOVIE APART, LISA!!!!* And yes, the movie is one of the movies that is truly so bad it's good. The script, and Wiseau's delivery of his lines, are guaranteed to make you smile for all the wrong reasons, so it qualifies as a guilty pleasure, too. And after seeing all the online hatchet jobs, I decided, ""Hey, it's on YouTube, and for free--why not enjoy it again?"" Unfortunately, by this time, the joke had worn off. Barely fifteen minutes into the movie, I was bored out of my mind. Camp comedy doesn't have a long shelf life in general, and when you outgrow it, you're left with the appalling mess that is The Room.The problem, obviously, is Tommy Wiseau, wholly and entirely. The Room is his story--his baby, if you will. It flows completely out of his understanding of American culture and the human condition--and it fails because Wiseau's understanding of American culture and the human condition is utterly and completely superficial.He knows, for example, that Americans in general love football, but he doesn't understand *why* we do, or that we put football aside when we have more pressing concerns (like a wedding). He knows that banks handle money, but he doesn't understand that an investment banker (which is what I'm presuming Johnny is, because I doubt very much he's a teller at your corner Citibank) is primarily in the business of *making* money, not just saving it. Johnny shouldn't be talking about how he saved the bank money; he should be talking about private placements and hedge funds. And so on and so on.Wiseau shows a similar ignorance of human character and relationships. The oft-mocked breast cancer line is actually an opportunity for Wiseau to explore the concept of ""like parent, like child""--if Lisa is manipulative and willing to tell outrageous lies to get what she wants, where's the most logical place for her to learn such behavior? This would also make Lisa's lack of reaction to the line more understandable. But Wiseau apparently doesn't have any grasp of the relationships between parents and their children; for all that he makes use of their relationship, Claudette and Lisa might as well be neighbors, co-workers, or perfect strangers rather than mother and daughter.The result is a script that makes no sense whatsoever, because Wiseau started by ignoring the first rule of writing, ""Write what you know"", and proceeded to blow off the second rule, ""If you don't know it, do your research."" Compounding the problem is Wiseau's complete lack of understanding of script structure; like a bad Off-Off-Broadway play, subplots come out of nowhere with absolutely no setup (for example, the Chris-R scene) or start and are dropped without any development (for example, the breast cancer line).Much has been made of the performances in The Room, but I will be blunt: if you could reach back in time and take great film actors to do the roles when they were the right ages to do so--say, a 1930s Laurence Olivier as Tommy, a 1970s Meryl Streep for Lisa, a 1960s Dustin Hoffman for Mark, etc.--they still wouldn't be able to do much with this script. The complete lack of depth means that none of the actors can give more than a surface performance, although a few--Robyn Paris and Carolyn Minnott, mostly--manage to at least make their characters somewhat interesting.Still, it's a good laugh, right? And yes, it is--the first two or three times you see it. Afterwards, the joke doesn't have the same impact. What made you laugh hysterically the first time you saw the movie only makes you grin now, and what made you grin only makes you roll your eyes.And eventually, the elephant in the room (no pun intended) makes itself known. This is about Tommy Wiseau. That's why the script gives Johnny absolutely no flaws: he's funny (so Wiseau thinks), generous (ditto), brave (not even armed drug dealers scare him!), philosophical, is everybody's friend, and everybody's ""favorite customer"". Wiseau, we realize, cannot afford to consciously give Johnny any warts to his character because that would undermine his own fragile self-esteem. And the amusement we feel at the joke of The Room turns into an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of our stomach, and a vague sense of guilt that we were laughing at this person in the first place.",The Room
123,joncheskin,"Horrible, Completely Entertaining",2,30 May 2020,"There have been a number of movies over the years that have achieved immortality by being so bad that they are strangely entertaining. The tradition started with Plan 9 from Outer Space and moved through Manos Hands of Fate, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and, in the modern day, Sharknado.It is not totally clear if this movie, The Room, falls into that category--it is so bad that you wonder if perhaps the director has a secret genius and is doing a spoof of said movies, or if his psycho-""drama"" love-triangle flick is just an earnest attempt at real cinema. Probably the latter, since the dialogue, story and characters of this movie are so amateurish, so far-fetched, and so talent-less that it simply could not be. No spoof could be this brilliant. It is just horrible. The mounting ""tension"" as the love triangle gets ever more exposed and gives way to ever more ridiculous situations and acting, is a beautiful thing to behold, as it is executed with complete earnestness. We watch dumbfounded, and occasionally drawn into hysterical laughter.Which brings me to the main reason you should watch this movie. It is hilarious. And it gets funnier as it goes along. And at the end, without tripping the spoiler alert, I can tell you that the last scene is one of the funniest I have ever seen in any movie in my entire life. My son and I, when we watched it, were falling off of our chairs in tears and could barely avoid having an asthma attack, we were both laughing so hard. I never thought I would see a film that could surpass Plan 9 for its campy hideousness, but this is the grandaddy of them all.

I didn't really laugh out loud at any point but it's quite amusing throughout. The dialogue comes across as starting a script in English then translating it to another language and then back to English. People blurt out dialogue in scenes like they've been coached to say it as quickly as possible. Tommy Wiseau dialogue seems like it has been dubbed throughout as it goes in and out of sync.The plot is non-existent and scenes don't seem to serve a plot they're just there. People come over to the apartment and then leave at the end of their scene which is usually 2 minutes after they arrive. Performances range from terrible to passable. Greg Sestero who plays Mark appears beleaguered throughout which is probably not acting but more the amount of work he was doing behind the scenes.All in all it's worth seeing to prepare to see the dramatized making of movie 'the Disaster Artist.

131,maxastree,The Room,7,30 September 2015,"The Room is the movie based on the book and theater piece by Tommy Wiseau, American immigrant and retail park manager, who wants to immortalize his romantic life, sexual hatreds and obsessions into a dark, twisted drama of betrayal. Its also a film that's so badly acted and produced that its generally hilarious.There's nothing really ""cool"" about the Room, as some cult movies actually are, its just a story of an honest, though somewhat creepy looking finance worker, who's almost-plump suburban girlfriend Lisa has plans to run off with the guy upstairs. The rest of the cast is: Lisa's mother, a vengeful sexual predator with breast cancer and Denny, a wholesome American sitcom teen that wants to watch Johnny (Wiseau's on screen character) and Lisa having sex. Denny's also got some underhanded goings-on with a local thug involving narcotics, something that unravels dramatically on their buildings rooftop where much of the films conflict scenes get especially fiery.Two points: this movie is filled with SEX, also its FUNNY AS SH*T, because the cast can't act and the plot points are all confused or very badly telegraphed.Its also worth 'splaining that Denny is sort of a surrogate ""little brother"" to Johnny, as he has no family of his own. Each scene sets Johnny up as selfless, idealistic, and an nurturing, except for one major event where he tries to fry Lisa for framing him for domestic abuse.The movie cost a freakin' bundle: writer/producer/director/star Wiseau commissioned a steamy R&B track for the movie, and his crew an assorted costs crept into the millions, plus billboard advertising to promote his project. Clearly, they didn't have the basic technical know-how for getting the best from their equipment; the most telling sign being the visible interlacing throughout the film.I won't spoil the ending, but I can add that personally, when I first found this film, I laughed uncontrollably for about a week and a half. Maybe a year or so later I returned to the movie, and it appeared to be littered with filler scenes, except for a few great one-liners. In a sense the film satirizes the fascination with love, betrayal and the sacred rite of bland, secure suburban fulfillment that's at the heart of a lot of TV drama and soap story lines. Its a funny movie, but mostly by accident apparently.A computer game and paperback novel detailing the films troubled production is available also.",The Room
132,nathanschubach,An awkward cult movie intended for comedic viewings instead of dramatic,3,3 February 2013,"""The Room"" is a modern cult classic for an audience who enjoys a good laugh from seeing a lackluster indie-film with numerous errors or quirks about it. Think ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" audience without the garish makeup, dancing or singing. The writer/director/actor Tommy Wiseau would take the praise either way about the film.Essentially, the film is about love and betrayal, why attraction is more important to some than stability. Lisa (played by Juliette Danielle) is having second thoughts about marrying Johnny (played by the aforementioned Wiseau) and chooses to make a rash decision behind his back which affects a number of their friends and family. It's a simple plot, and the simple production makes you feel like you're watching a play or an after-school special about being truthful (if it wasn't for the nudity, it would be). The movie's original music was a nice addition, and it even had a theme made for the movie, which you hear at the beginning and somewhere in the middle. The rest of the music was underground R&B and thrown into the film during one of the four sex scenes and the credits.There are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, mostly due to Wiseau's awkward delivery of his lines that he wrote and the painful delivery of most of the cast. Characters pop in and out of scenes at random and with strange motives, and some of Johnny's heartfelt emotional moments are cut short to say hi to his best friend, Mark. The chemistry between the cast makes them feel like strangers amongst one another, and some characters are downright goofy, making faces (Mike) and acting stupid and weird (Denny). There's even an entire scene that has no business in the movie (the drug dealer gone insane).Overall, the movie is meant for college parties and midnight screeners as a goof, not a masterpiece theater. It won an award somehow for an Audience Award of the Best Feature Film in the New York Int'l Indie Film & Video Festival, and I have to imagine there were plenty of tongue-in- cheek voters on that panel. By a quick read of the trivia found on this site, it sounds like Wiseau really poured his money, heart and ideas out there, but what it produced was as savory as a Jell-o dessert.",The Room
133,HollisWoods,"The king of ""so bad its good""",3,2 February 2021,"The acting is so terrible and stale. The dialogue is awkward and doesn't flow. I dare anybody to do a drinking game - one shot for every time they say ""oh hi 'name'"" and 5 shots for the infamous ""oh hi Mark"" line. There is just no chemistry or emotion between the characters or actors. They just seem like a bunch of fake friends pretending to like each other. The characters themselves were just dry and colorless and had no dimension at all. The story itself is stupid. Maybe different story arcs looked good on paper, but the execution was poor. And to top it all off, there are a few more sex scenes than necessary.Now that the complaints are out of the way, let me give credit where credit is due:
Everything that makes The Room bad is everything that makes The Room good.Of course it's a bad film, but it has its charms. The story of the Room was flawed, but it really did have some good themes in there, and its obvious that Wiseau tried his best to get different messages across, particularly through the use of Danny's character. Hearing about the making of the film is interesting as well and adds to the experience (watch Disaster Artist before and/or after watching the Room). My rating is 3/10 - 2 stars for the attempt of making a decent move, and 3 stars for Sir Tommy Wiseau.Tommy Wiseau gave it his all in this film. He wanted to make a movie, so he did. Though I'm sure the movie upon release was received poorly, he continues to work to this day and has many beloved fans that follow this cult classic. It's honestly inspiring that he achieved success, but in a way he probably wasn't expecting. As low quality as the Room is, it was at least entertaining. I plan to watch other Wiseau films someday, just to see how much has evolved, and to support an independent film maker who dedicates his life expressing himself through the art of film.",The Room
134,tommystans,Hilariously bad,1,13 May 2014,"When it comes to films like 'Sharknado' (2012) most people would say 'It's bad but good', though I don't agree on the example as I hate films that are forced to be bad rather then doing it naturally and this is an example of it. I will admit, the writing is bad, the characters are bad, the acting is bad and the filming is bad. Tommy Wiseu is just one of the worst actors I've seen. He doesn't put too much emotion towards it, even his temper tantrum scene is just hilariously bad when he's really trying to be acting but never succeed in such progress. The story is bad, some scenes like the girlfriend talking to her mother is repetitive as it's the same conversation over and over again about her not loving 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseu) and the Breast Cancer scene doesn't bring much of a dramatic effect, it's just like 'I have breast cancer big whoop(!)' But I think the worst scene was when they found the main character's dead body on the ground after putting a bullet to his mouth and one character says 'Wake up Johnny' while GF says 'is he dead?' OK when it comes to a person lying down on the ground with blood smeared everywhere on the floor and probably his bowels voided too, it shows that yes he is dead even a person with half a brain would know he's dead the first second they see the body. As I heard Wiseu says that the film WAS intentionally bad, it doesn't feel intentional at all. It feels like a film that is trying so so so so so hard at being a drama that it fails miserably.

137,allexand,"Prepare yourself for the madness of ... ""The Room""",2,25 March 2011,"""The Room,"" as I write this review, has already achieved cult status. It gets lovingly heckled at midnight shows and mastermind Tommy Wiseau is saying this is what he intended all along.Of course, most of us know better.Upon watching it, anyone can see that ""The Room"" was intended to be a serious Shakespearean-style drama.But somehow, it went horribly wrong.I guess I'll start with the multi-hyphenate lead character of this farce, Johnny, played by Tommy Wiseau, since he wrote, starred in, and directed this. His acting and delivery is just surreal. In some scenes, he is extremely sedate while in others he devours entire set pieces whole. His speech patterns are even more bizarre. He delivers most of his lines as though he's a malfunctioning robot, putting emphasis on the wrong words and the wrong syllables and slurring to the point of incomprehensibility, all with a indescribable thick accent that makes Arnold Schwarzenegger seem coherent by comparison. The irony of all this though is that the movie would be largely forgettable without him.We move on to the next big problem: the dialogue. The problem with it is that it's extremely vague, repetitive, and unnatural. It comes off as adult conversation as imagined in the mind of a 7-year-old. Johnny works in a bank and Lisa works in the ""computer business,"" but no specifics are given as to what they actually do. Characters constantly announce that they're busy while doing nothing, that is when they aren't repeating themselves. Halfway through the movie, you will know that Lisa is beautiful but can't support herself, Mark is Johnny's best friend, and Johnny is a nice guy because the characters constantly remind you. Johnny's supposed nice guy status is especially hard to swallow considering his creepy appearance and demeanor.Conversations are rather schizophrenic and have no natural flow to them. Lisa's mother's revelation that she has cancer is promptly dismissed with ""Don't worry about it"" and never brought up again. Same goes for Denny's drug problems in perhaps the weirdest scene in the whole film. Denny begins by announcing to his dealer that the money will be delivered (by whom?) followed by Lisa and her mother tag-teaming him with dumb questions and hammy acting (""What kind of money?"", ""Where'd you meet a man like that?""), culminating in the announcement that the drug pusher has somehow been arrested. Then there are the scenes where Johnny abruptly switches from discussing work to probing about Mark's sex life and the scatterbrained dialogue of the flower shop scene delivered at rapid-fire pace. Mark, not to be outdone, constantly stands there like an idiot asking Lisa what she's up to every time she seduces him. Johnny also has a pathological need to compulsively greet everyone he crosses paths with and laughs spontaneously, often for no reason.The characters not only talk like idiots, they behave like them too. Characters announce that they're leaving despite the fact that they just arrived five seconds ago. They show up unannounced to have sex on Johnny's couch. They spontaneously break out into games of extremely close-contact football. A character suddenly berates Lisa for cheating even though we've never seen him before and have no idea who he is. Lisa decides to discuss her affair with her mother and later arrange a booty call with Mark, both times with Johnny in earshot. As if that weren't enough she tries too hook up with Mark in the middle of Johnny's birthday party... in the living room! However, the standout examples are Denny's declaration that he wants to watch Lisa and Johnny have sex and their subsequent dismissal of it and Johnny's Godzilla-like tirade just before he kills himself.The pacing is noticeably poor. The film is constantly interrupted with shots of random San Francisco landmarks not only as a reminder of where the film takes place but also to show the passage of time. The party scene alone must have at least four of these despite it occurring in a single night, and only a few of them overall are even related to the film's main setting. We must watch two customers order coffee before the main characters do. The most blatant examples of bad pacing by far is the unnecessary impromptu tuxedo football game and the numerous long, drawn out sex scenes set to 4-minute crappy R&B songs played out in their entirety and are anything but sexy. Watching them makes me wonder if Tommy Wiseau has ever even had sex as he seems intent on humping Lisa's bellybutton and her left breast. I guess that's why they decided to add moaning and kissing noises to these scenes: to clear any confusion. Three of them occur within the first twenty-five minutes alone.And finally, we have the sets. With the exception of a few San Francisco exterior scenes, they're all laughably cheap. The living room is probably the best looking even though their TV is actually behind them and there's a door that leads to nowhere. The upstairs bedroom has a banister that wobbles and the stairs don't seem to match the lower floor. The alleyway walls have a painted-on brick pattern as does the rooftop, which deserves its own special mention because of the obvious green-screen backdrop and stairwell that, as near as I can tell, veers off the edge of the building.""The Room"" will certainly leave you with many questions.How did Tommy Wiseau raise 6 million dollars for this thing? Why is it called ""The Room?"" What is wrong with Lisa's neck? Regardless, the fact that Tommy Wiseau got this thing made is something that this reviewer finds truly awe-inspiring.",The Room

As a matter of fact, The Room is so random and unintelligible, that is becomes a cold reboot of everything we've come to know about movies.Does it break the 4th wall? Kinda...... But not intentionally which makes it everything people talk about. It's re-watchable too. And now that The Disaster Artist is out, it will give you a different take on how you may have thought it was created.No, it's not genius, and far from it. The Room is pure hope, and drive. It's a celebration in lack of talent and direction. It showcases a sense of strange mainstreaming that everyone should at least take note of. Real life is unscripted and random. It can be fun, and the Room is fun!! Tommy Wiseau might be the most authentic protagonist to the abnormality in us all. That's not a bad thing, and we shouldn't be ashamed. We should celebrate our own shortcomings because that's what life is.The Room is so wonderfully awful (as has been said a thousand time before). But it gives us all a reason to spotlight certain traits that make us all special. Enjoy every day, and if it's awful, find a reason to laugh. We only make this journey once, so have fun with it!

140,guskeller,A glorious wreck,1,8 November 2021,"The Room is famously terrible. First, it's amazing how the dialogue nonsensically bounces around topics yet also repeats earlier conversations, going everywhere and nowhere at once. Meanwhile, entire scenes are unrelated to the narrative while other scenes are copies of previous moments. Plot points are introduced and instantly abandoned. Characters' actions are inconsistent and illogical. This is amplified by the fascinatingly bad acting, particularly Tommy Wiseau's. His energy level is often inappropriate and his transitions between emotional beats are comically unnatural.From a technical standpoint, The Room has slight merit but only in a relative sense. The sound design is okay, but audio effects are overused and Tommy's dubbing is hilariously unconvincing. The camera framing mostly captures its subjects, but sometimes action is outside the shot. The musical mood is usually in the correct ballpark, but the end credits song is an R&B ballad that doesn't match. Lastly, the production design looks like actual sets, but they're cheap and poorly dressed. Ultimately, The Room is a symphony of disasters that is quite fun to laugh at. It's not for everyone and it's certainly not conventionally good, but The Room is a glorious wreck.Writing: 0/10

141,nuhc,This film is tearing me apart!,1,27 June 2012,"I became aware of The Room after reading reviews for Birdemic, comparing two bad films. So I had to sit down and watch The Room to see for myself, which I did with no preconceptions about it other than a few vague references to it being a bad movie.I won't say it's the worst film ever made, since I believe that (dis)honor goes to Birdemic in my opinion. While The Room had atrocious acting, a lousy plot, and poor dialog, it at least had decent editing and good sound although if I see one more panning shot of San Francisco I think I'm going to vomit.Several things which brought this film down were the aforementioned poor acting (whoever told Tommy Wiseau that he could act needs to be slapped senseless), lousy dialog, and poor plot. There was only one or two decent actors in the whole film.The character of Denny was just annoying. I mean, he's 18, not 8 for goodness' sakes, why does he want to throw the football around all the time? Speaking of which, the one football toss scene where the actors kept running into and out of the scene reminded me of a Saturday Night Live skit.The use of green screen in the rooftop scenes was pretty noticeable, partially because the actors hair didn't blow in the wind. This wasn't particularly annoying though.There was nothing lovable about the character of Johnny which made you want to like him. The way he acted didn't give off any feeling of warmth, so why was everyone so concerned about his feelings? There also could have been a couple of good subplot with Denny & the drug dealer, but once that conflict was over, it was never mentioned again, nor did they ever figure out why he was buying drugs anyway. Same with Lisa's mother telling her about having breast cancer, almost in passing. But once that scene was over, nothing else was ever said. It's like those parts of the movie were just thrown in for the heck of it. The fight scenes were totally unrealistic (as was everything else) and near the end when Johnny was going on his ""rampage"" was pretty laughable. Basically the whole movie was worse that a Lifetime made-for-TV movie, with basically the same plot. Even as a so-bad-it's-good type of movie, this one doesn't even make me want to laugh at it.",The Room

That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this movie however! I have very really laughed so much at a screwball comedy let alone a movie labeled as a romantic drama. Every single scene had me in stitches. Tommy Wiseau is either the worst filmmaker ever or secretly the comedic genius the world needed. I prefer the former as him genuinely thinking this movie was going to be great makes the movie a whole other level of funny.

It has been said that even in the event of the best movie makers in the world coming together to try to make the worst movie of all time, they could still not make this - so, this is an exquisite work of art. To give examples, the acting is horrible, the lightning and the stage look like you are watching a soap opera, the story line is inconsistent, and so on. This movie cost almost a million dollar to make and the director still believes it is a great flick up to this day. The cult following is grateful to him, calling themselves Roomies. I believe it still shows in theaters in the US on a regular basis where these followers flock together, imitating their favorite characters, so eventually the movie will make a profit.

145,neobateman,A masterpiece of trash film making,10,7 November 2017,"The story of 'The Room' can honestly be inspirational. Tommy Wiseau was a nobody before this film and now we all quote his lines from this disaster. I have never reviewed such a film, a film that is filled with horrible acting, editing, lighting or special effects yet for some reason is so great. Of course the pure stupidity of this film was never intentional which is why it is so hilarious. Wiseau intended this to be a breakthrough motion picture, the film that would catapult him to the top of the food chain in Hollywood. This attitude can be seen when you watch 'The Room'. It is very easy to spot the indulgence of the film maker, he gives it his all in the film. Don't get me wrong, his performance is truly terrible but he is still trying so hard which in a lot of ways I admire. The film went through horrible production issues, many of the crew members abandoned the project and Wiseau had to find replacements. I admire that he continued and finished the picture even with everyone against him. The film offers some of the hardest laughs I have ever seen in a film, I laughed more frequent than even in some of the better comedies. This is absolutely a remarkable picture that I believe should be seen by everyone. Especially that we are now getting the behind the scenes story of this film in this year's 'The Disaster Artist'. In summary, I do not think that 'The Room' is good movie, it's the exact opposite but what makes the film so great is the fact that they were trying so hard to make a good movie. Wiseau wanted to make a thought provoking and dramatic picture, but it turned out to be a perfect example of a disastrous piece of art.",The Room

THE ROOM is one of those rare laugh-riots that is so fantastically inept as to border on genius. While most bad movies offer a handful of terrible scenes divided by stretches of just plain dull, writer-director-producer-star Tommy Wiseau's film offers one moment of disaster after another.Whether it's the made-up-by-fifth-graders dialogue, the deer-in-headlights performances, or the positively icky sex scenes (love those smushed rose petals on the chubby girl's back), you'll be howling from start to finish.This movie has already amassed a cult of people who know what to yell at the screen and when; for a movie that's being self-distributed, this rates as some kind of crap-movie miracle.Keep an eye out for the pointless insert shots of San Francisco, which give the idea of time passing even when it doesn't: one party scene, for example, features eight of these cut-aways.You really can't believe how terrible THE ROOM is, but at least it's entertaining, albeit in ways that the lazy-eyed, odd-bodied, English-mangling auteur never imagined.

Characters walk in people's houses without permission, people don't use the phone, make dumb decisions, and the fact that the scene transition is repetitive. You'll see characters talking in one scene, then there is a random sex scene afterwards. The sex scenes really bring this movie down, they're uncomfortable to watch and you are really tempted to skip them. There are way too many sex scenes than there should be.

The Room has been called the Citizen Kane of bad movies and even if Citizen Kane might not be the greatest movie ever The Room is most certainly the worst movie ever made.The Room is filled with so many funny details that it is almost impossible to list them. Each viewing will make it funnier because you get to know the characters and know when things will be funny so you can focus on other new terribly funny parts. I haven't laughed this much while watching Some Like it Hot , Sienfeld and others.The Room is essentialy a very poorly made drama in all aspects. The actors deliver dialogues in a terribly dead pan manner. It can be the worst of news or the best of news the expressions will remain the same and the delivery be flat. The dialogues are hilarious. The situations are even funnier. Situations are introduced but then put away in an instant as if they were never happening. Fights begin and end within seconds and things go back to normal. The movie is filled with numerous sex scenes that go endlessly and mostly have the same kind of shots. The lead actor played by the actor – director Tommy Wisseau keeps laughing in his weird manner which alone gives the money the cult quality.During advertising Wisseau compared the film to a good Tenesse Williams drama. Later, he went on to say that he intentionally made a comedy. I don't what is true and even though it is more likely that he made a terrible movie I am glad he did.

That feeling is the feeling that you feel while you're watching The Room.

But The Room is actually about a non-human who tries to pass himself off as one of us and doesn't fool anyone. There are plenty of movies with actors who can't act in them. But with the rest of them, you figure that when they're not in front of the camera, they can probably order a burrito without needing some kind of Star Trek universal translator device.

It fails in every possible level so badly, that it becomes incredibly funny. This movie is bad, bad, bad, bad, bad. So bad, that it becomes a gigantic joke. And Mr. Wiseau is riding in the top of it.The plot? (spoiler alert) a cyborg called Johnny works in a bank, but his girlfriend, Lisa, cheats on him with his ""best friend"" Mark. Why?, because ""Lisa is so beautiful"", and ""she doesn't love Johnny anymore"". Yep, those are all the reasons we got. In fact the lines ""Lisa is so beautiful"", ""Johnny/Mark is my best friend"" and ""I don't love Johnny anymore"" are repeated over and over again. I think Mr. Wiseau was worried with viewers forgetting those important plot points. So, at the end, Johnny finds out everything in his birthday party, and he kills himself after destroying a room. Yep, pretty lame.But, from this lame plot as the seed, a mighty tree of awfulness grows. The dialog is stupid beyond belief: repetitive, with scenes thrown at random and other scenes almost duplicated point by point. The acting is awful, and subplots and characters are introduced and then dropped immediately. And, the cherry of the cake are Tommy Wiseau's ""acting"" skills... which are so hilariously bad, it's incredible, a must-see.So, as a movie, this thing is a failure of epic proportions.

In retrospect, Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" is an indie film that is overlooked for all the ""right reasons"". It's a black comedy romance, that revolves around a love traingle between Johnny (Tommy Wiseau), Lisa (Juliette Danielle), and Johnny's best friend Mark (Greg Sestero). The overall narrative is confusing with several subplots juggling around at the same time. Any movie-goer (even little kids) could point out all the plot holes and visual errors of this 90 min film. The characters are all from the stockpile of any movie cliché one can think of. The dialogue is beyond the horribleness of a George Lucas (not to mention that most of Tommy Wiseau's dialogue is dubbed). Nothing is subtle in this film, any moment of awkwardness sticks out like a sore thumb. Despite these numerous faults, ""The Room"" is probably the most entertaining film ever made. I wouldn't be lying if I said I would watch this film over and over again and still laughing at Tommy Wiseau's odd delivery of lines and the awkward ""filler scenes"" that flushes away some of the drama.

I understand why it has a cult following: it is almost a masterclass in film making ineptitude. But surely giving this film a rating of 10 subverts that notoriety? Whatever.Simply put, this is a big, pile of steaming rubbish. Technically it is no better (and indeed, in many ways worse) than a cheap day time soap opera.

The script is incoherent with a multitude of incomplete story arcs, google translate dialogue and utterly insane narrative. You could forgive any of these issues if this were made and conceived by 7 year olds but the fact that this is made by actual, real grown ups makes one question our progression as a species.I read somewhere that this cost 6 million dollars to make. I would love to see the budget breakdown because just about any film student could make this with some amateur actors and an iphone and it would be better.

At first, I dismissed it saying that it was laughably bad (which it still is today). As I watched again and again, I slowly got more and more intrigued by its symbolism. Imagine : A weird, tall man with a creepy accent and girly, long, curly black hair. An incredibly and unabashedly unfaithful fiancée. A friend whose friendship is questionable due to his actions of betrayal. An innocent-looking kid who gets involved with things much darker for anyone's taste. The fiancée's ever-inquisitive yet moral mother. These are not just the complex characters of 'The Room', but a small part in everyone's mind.I read somewhere that Tommy Wiseau used to be a psychologist, and so it would seem only natural for him to make a film of this nature, with disturbingly complex characters, and the small, seemingly irrelevant but impactful situations they are put in. Johnny's weird accent, Denny's random perversions, Lisa's utter lack of shame, and Mark's true innocence, are not just the characteristics of the characters, but they are all part of one's MIND.After I watched 'The Room' many times, I realized why the characters always acted and reacted weirdly.

This movie is funny the whole way through, and while i think that is in good part thanks to the audience I've seen it with, the movie itself is an absolute joy.The dialogue is bizarre, the sex scenes drag on, the camera work is weird and directly unprofessional and the acting. It feels almost intentionally bad. The actors are so distant, and the fact that Tommy insisted on filming on a green screen stage, rather than a live location for many scenes, only helps make it better.This movie is fantastic and i genuinely love it.For that, i give it 10/10.",The Room
168,eline-hoskens,You will NOT believe THIS!!! A MUST SEE!,1,5 August 2013,"Wow! Just to be fair, I'm rating this movie as 'awful', because it is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life! HOWEVER, I never had more fun with a movie rated 10 stars! Also, I've seen it more than 3 times by the time I write this review. That means something.This movie is really AWSFUL and the absolute proof that aliens exist!Because you HAVE to be an alien to: 1) be able to claim you're an American and yet speak with such an out-of-this-world Transyl-Bulgarian accent from Mars. 2) to actually open every scene with ""Oh hi, (name of the character)"". 3) to have the guts to show your naked body ON SCREEN after having it 'improved' by a delirious intern experimenting with botox. 4) have a talent to cast the worst actors and / or give the worst stage directions in history. 5) To remain faithful to the illusion that you have created a masterpiece for the rest of your life after all these horrible reviews AND to be convinced that only truly intelligent viewers could appreciate your work and that people could actually learn a lot from you. They should, just once, offer an Oscar for 'worst all-in-one film creator EVER'! Seeing how ONE SINGLE movie can be SO BAD in SO MANY different respects is mind blowing!This man has a TALENT! 1) Even if you tried REALLY HARD you could never be a worse actor than him. 2) Even the worst director could never willingly make a movie this crappy. 3) If a dog, just ran over by a truck, would try to bark together a script it would be better than this. This movie is awful, hilarious and un-be-lie-va-ble at the same time. Also, it's very very very SAD. It's obvious Tommy Wiseau wants you to feel for his character. He wants you to think Lisa is a bitch for leaving him, while actually you don't understand why any woman in her right mind would fall for a guy like that! He wants you to think his character is the most wonderful guy in the world! After all, he brings her flowers, takes care of a lonely boy, is not angry when people have sex in his apartment for no reason, etc. Even 'the mother-in-law' approves of him! He wants you to cry at the end when he commits suicide... but actually all you feel is: ""Go shoot yourself you big whiner!"" The only thing you're sorry about is that it took so long. This movie is obviously intended to be a drama but that's actually the last thing it is. It's not even a movie! At most, it's a documentary about a bunch of weird people trying to make one. The conversations are unnatural, the situations are bizarre, out of this world even. The choice of music (especially during the sex scenes - who asked for them anyway?!) is terrible! (You are my rose, you are my rose, you are my rose...)In drama class we used to practise our lines by throwing a ball at each other while saying them out loud. This guy actually uses this exercise in a scene several times! Hilarious! He probably read in a book on narratology that it's good to have your characters do something during a scene. :-) Imagine what would happen if Tommy Wiseau read a book on surgery!""Anyway how's your sex life?""Maybe Tommy Wiseau should study human behaviour in stead of 'Explaining it all on YouTube'. He'd notice people don't just say: ""I'm so happy to have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much""... out of the blue.Really dude: ""Show me don't tell me!""Anyway...

Ninja Turtle movies are bad. Anything by Uwe Boll is bad. This is next level terrible. Tommy Wiseau's vanity project, this Tennessee Williams-wannabe nonsense is so terrible that mere words aren't enough to describe it.The plot, if you want to call it that, is contrived nonsense that features more sex scenes in the first half hour than in some Skinemax flicks, and overlong dialogue in desperate need of editing. There are scenes that go nowhere, lots of conversation that is meaningless, and characters that are underdeveloped and whose appearances make no sense.If you like long shots of San Francisco, this is definitely the movie for that. Most films use one or two expository shots, adding more if the film is picking up from a specific spot in a city, but for a long time, this movie stays primarily in the apartment, and has its characters engage in repetitive, meaningless conversation, like a cancer diagnosis being blown right past with no reaction from either character in the scene.Watching the Rifftrax version of this film is the only way it is watchable. That is an easy 10/10, and even as an MST3K fan, I've not laughed that hard in a long time.On its own, this movie is a pointless slog that needed someone to seriously check Tommy Wiseau's ego. It's horribly unwatchable, nothing happens of consequence until the birthday party, so that's an hour of time you can easily bypass and miss nothing, and the only real highlight for me is when Johnny blows his own head off. That itself should say everything about The Room.That said, I feel like The Disaster Artist will be a great telling of the making of this movie, as it's clear there had to be a lot of wacky shenanigans going on behind the scenes, and I'm looking forward to seeing how they played out.But the movie itself? Ye gads. Horrible. But I'll re-watch the Rifftrax version over and over again, no doubt about that.",The Room
171,sean-57842,Over-rated nonsense.,2,17 January 2020,"On the surface of it, The Room is yet another really bad movie about failed romance. There are plenty of them out there, I'm sure. However, what makes The Room so alluring is its creator and star, Tommy Wiseau. I am obviously not alone in this fascination, as the film has enjoyed a cult status for many years and has recently seem a mocku-docu-drama-whatever insight released with James Franco at the helm. As ridiculous as that film is, it does help shed a light on the backstory of Wiseau himself.As perplexing and morbidly fascinating that Mr. Wiseau is, I cannot shake the feeling that this guy just got lucky. Where he (and his money) came from is still a head-scratching mystery, but casting him or The Room in any sort of light that paints it as purposefully bad, ironic or even artistic is just plain wrong (I saw the awkward character interactions of The Room compared to the works of David Lynch and whilst I drew my own similarities with the surreal or awkward moments, the directors are quite obviously leagues apart). If there was no such thing as meme culture, there would be no career for Tommy Wiseau, and he would most likely just be another dreamer who had a stab at Hollywood and then fell into obscurity.I mean no disrespect to the man, as The Room is incredibly entertaining despite its deathly pace and repetition. I could just happily go through my entire remaining existence in this world without ever seeing this film again.",The Room
172,nbwritersinbox,I Finally Sat Through The Room !!! (But Only Just... ),1,29 December 2012,"How has ""The Room"" managed a three star rating on IMDb? Contributors here are generous souls.Reading audience and critical reaction about ""The Room"" is more entertaining than watching its 99 minutes of jaw-dropping, mind-melting celluloid lunacy. Although, I must warn you, ""The Room"" can be addictive (for all the wrong reasons).I'm interested in both film-making and writing, so Tommy Wiseau's disasterpiece plays out like a kind of crazy text book on ""How Not To Make A Movie"" - But as an advert for Independent Film Making it feels similar to selling tickets for the Titanic.The serious point here is that Independent Films are so important for the industry. And, its with independent productions that new talent in all areas of Entertainment can shine and even prosper. Tommy Wiseau is a far better business man than he is an actor/director/writer. His genius lay in raising $2 million dollars to fund this self-indulgent, grandiose folly. If you're going to rip up the rule book on movie-making, at least care enough about your audience to make something worth watching. The Room does not feel like a black comedy. The treatment of women (the central female character is both unscrupulous and amoral) and theme of sexual betrayal explored in the script are just not comedic. Almost by accident, Tommy shows us how vacuous modern life and relationships can be.Top Reviewer Comments:Linkara: ""It sucks out your mind and replaces it with stupid!""Scott Foundas- Variety Magazine: The film prompted ""most of its viewers to ask for their money back... Before 30 minutes had passed!""Nostalgia Critic: ""You can basically make trading cards out of how many pointless sequences there are in this movie!""Questions About The Room:Why is the director obsessed with San Francisco and its trams?

Tommy Wiseau, the director, is a finger-painter who thought he was creating the Mona Lisa and accidentally drew the world's funniest and most wildly popular picture of a willy.At the end of the day, you have to rate any creative endeavour based on how well it achieves its intended goals and that's why, with a very heavy heart, I must award The Room one solitary star. This star is awarded for the act of existing, and I present it out of sheer charity. If enjoyment could only be derived from an appraisal of technical skill, the only thing worse than this train crash of a film would be watching it on a crashing train.But if you were to rate the experience of this movie it would get ten stars.

177,vinylvanilla,A masterpiece that everybody should watch.,8,19 December 2017,"I am among those people who watched ""The Room"" to get ready for the ""Disaster Artist"", featuring James Franco. I was ready to be confronted with the so-called worst movie ever, but what I saw is completely different: this movie is a true work of art, for many reasons.1. The plot - to whoever says the plot is weak or unconvincing, this is a plot that has the simplicity and the mediocrity of the real life - characters who are just okay, a life that is just okay. Which is not bad, on the contrary : it perfectly portrays our mediocre, prosaic human life. 2. Cinematography - Though I agree the scenario could look better, the music score is perfect for the movie, I'd say David Lynchesque somehow, especially during the dramatic scenes. It sets a kitsch yet creepy tone that makes this movie so unique. 3. Symbology - Lisa always wears a black piece of clothing when she's cheating on Johnny. Also, the red color dress that he gives to her symbolizes sacrifice, he wants her to give all her love to him, and at the same time, the union with Johnny feels like a terrible sacrifice to her. The football scenes represent the bonding between the male characters. All good characters are dark-haired and all psychopathic characters are light-haired, which is a good twist that makes this movie different and refuses to follow the ""blonde guys are good, dark-haired guys are bad"" stereotype. 4. Edition - one particular thing that really drew my attention and puts this movie among one the most amazing of all times is the deliberate repetition of the sex scenes between Johnny and Lisa. A clever yet subtle way to demonstrate how repetitive and prosaic was their relationship. Also, there are no time indicators in this movie. One scene jumps right next to the other, without actually impacting the understanding of the plot. 5. Characters - we see in Lisa a psychopath in its true form. Also, her relationship with her mother is a brilliant detail of this movie because it shows exactly where Lisa's psychopathic tendencies came from - her mother, who believes Lisa should only stay engaged to Johnny because he gives her money. The two women are so psychopathic that even when the mother talks about her breast cancer, the daughter is completely blasé about it, while the mother is in completely denial as well. Mark, on the other hand, is an opportunistic man who wanted to keep friends with Johnny because of his money and influence, and yet wanted to keep having sex with Lisa. He victimizes himself the whole movie trying to pretend ""he was seduced"" by the ""manipulative bitch"", refusing to take responsibility for his acts. Johnny, on the other hand, is the quirky yet naive man who just wants to be love and share his feelings with the world. You can see he has some personality disorder by looking at his insecurity and his mannerisms. He's extremely attached to people, which unfortunately led to his suicide. 6. Ending - there could never be a more realistic and nihilistic ending than this. Not even Lars von Trier or David Lynch could reach this kind of brutal and nihilistic ending without looking pretentious or over-the-top. Johnny's death is a punch in the viewer's face, and a reality check. I truly and sincerely think this is one of the BEST MOVIES I have ever seen, so clever, unique and unpretentious in all forms. This deserves to be praised alongside with Amadeus, Taxi Driver, Scarface and many others unpretentious yet great masterpieces of cinema.",The Room
178,heffay111,Liberation in Mediocrity,1,31 May 2009,"There are more than enough reviews of this movie that tell you in wonderful ways how absolutely perfect the awfulness of ""The Room"" is. What I found terribly interesting when I was brought to a Los Angeles midnight screening of this movie, besides the fact that this damn thing was on five screens at once, is that this movie provides the moviegoer with the rare opportunity to absolutely mock terrible cinema.I see several movies per year, often from the major studios, that I long to shout at in disgust. ""The Room"" is terrible to the point that the audience has agreed to do just that. It is liberating and hilarious and downright therapeutic to shout, when a character who has never been established suddenly appears on screen, ""Who are you?"" Wiseau shows up at these Los Angeles screenings and revels in what he seems to think is adoration, almost psychotically not in on the joke.You do not go to ""The Room"" to see a movie.

Nothing good can be said by a sensible intelligent person about this film, period. That said, what the 10 star young people seem to rave about is the ""experience"" part of the screening. As ""Rocky Horror"" did years ago, ""The Room"" has created a cult following of young people (mostly) who go to the film to make fun of the corny dialogue and silly premises. As with any ""experience"" film, the fun is that most of the audience has already seen the movie. They shout out the dialogue and give appropriate groans when the dialogue is exceptionally bad (which is almost always the case). If that is what you crave - a social interactive film experience - then ""The Room"" is your kind of movie. It has nothing else to offer... really. It is not an independent classic. It is not the great insight of a film genius. It is not the latest trend in cinema (although it closely resembles aspects of reality television). And, it is not a good movie. It is a very, very bad movie. But the experience is fun. Thus ended the lesson.",The Room
182,anthonygiancola24,The voice of innocence whispers in our ears...,10,10 June 2018,"Is it really possible that this luminous masterpiece is a first feature film? It is as though Mozart had started his career in composition with one of his mature symphonies. What is totally special about 'The Room' is the visual control that Tommy Wiseau applies to the story, and his use of fabulous music to embed his amazing images in our mind. The 'Talented Mr. Ripley'-ish story could have been turgid, but Wiseau turns it into a mythic journey.At the heart of Wiseau's method is the fabulous use of repetition in his work with the character Greg. ""What's going on here?"". This has been characteristic of each of Wiseau's films. Here it totally sucks the viewer into the story and is just about, the high-point of 2000s cinema. Alongside this, Wiseau uses some of the most haunting music in existence. Whether it is Kitra Williams or Clint Jun Gamboa, Wiseau transports us with fabulous romantic imagery that perfectly balances it.I started on this comment determined not to use the word 'poetry', but I just can't avoid it. With nearly all filmmakers, including very great ones, the style that they present is very much prose - great prose, perhaps, but firmly rooted on the ground. With Wiseau, we are taken, emotionally, to the stars by the lyric magnificence of the totality of his vision.It is said that Welles learned cinema by watching John Ford's 'Stagecoach' before embarking on 'Citizen Kane'. Every young filmmaker should watch this amazing masterpiece again and again and again and inform their work with Wiseau's matchless sense of true cinema.",The Room

Yet at the same time, it's just so damn entertaining, my favorite scene is when he is having his tantrum towards the end of the film.The dialog in this film is also so strange it makes you think, how could a self respecting actor/actress agree to do such obvious bulls**t. But, at the same time, that is what makes it so interesting, I want to keep watching, it's hilarious.This film actually gets points for how bad it is. God, it had me in stitches.

Also if you are reading this you have either already seen it or are planning to give it go anyway. And I would encourage you if you haven't already to experience this piece of bizarro genius at least once especially if you're a cinephile. It truly is unlike anything else you will ever see. It might not be possible to make a more uproariously funny unintentional comedy than 'The Room'. Tommy Wiseau, the financier, producer, director, writer and star of this movie poured heart, sole and all of his passion into this disaster-piece. From the atrocious acting to the laughable dialogue to the inexplicably abandoned subplots to the women stereotypes, virtually every scene elicits thunderous laughter from the audience. What might be even funnier is when you find out that Wiseau intended the film to be a Tennessee Williams level drama. And there are obvious allusions to the melodramas of the 1950's/60's with stolen lines like 'You are tearing me apart!' taken directly from Nicholas Ray's 'Rebel Without a Cause' but without any of the context and spun into hilarity.What is truly remarkable about 'The Room' is how it has sustained for this long and how it became a cult classic. There are tons of bad movies that get released every single year and fade into obscurity but not this one. No, not 'The Room'. It has even managed to make its ridiculously high budget of $6 Million back after countless midnight screenings worldwide since it first came out in 2003. You see what sets this particular awfully bad movie apart from other awfully bad movies is that it never feels like Tommy Wiseau is not trying to make something special. And make something special he did with what is now widely known as 'The Citizen Kane of bad movies'. If you want to find out more about 'The Room' and how it was made then check out the book 'The Disaster Artist' written by Greg Sestero, the actor who plays Mark in the movie and Tommy's real life best friend, and journalist Tom Bissell. Then go watch the adaptation of the book, which keeps the same name, directed by and starring James Franco as Tommy Wiseau. It also stars Franco's brother Dave as Greg Sestero and a plethora of other recognizable faces such as Seth Rogen, Alison Brie and Paul Scheer. The movie is garnering a lot of awards buzz and at this point in time has been nominated for two Golden Globes including Best Picture (Musical or Comedy) and Best Actor (Musical or Comedy) for James Franco. Its going to be truly surreal seeing Tommy Wiseau finally attending these awards shows in the coming months, something which he thought 'The Room' would allow him to do all those years ago. Instead he had to wait for a great movie to be made about his terrible movie.",The Room

189,Skaigear,Really bad movie that is strangely enjoyable,2,18 August 2017,"The Room is a romantic drama film written and directed by Tommy Wiseau, staring himself as the character of Johnny. Not too often does a movie reach cult classic status because it is considered be the worst movie of all time. Its terribleness has caught the eyes of millions, including actors James Franco and Seth Rogen, prompting them to produce an autobiography based on the making of this movie called The Disaster Artist. The Room's notoriety is well known on the internet, with memes and quotes littering on YouTube's comment section like ""You're tearing me apart, Lisa,"" ""That's the idea!"" ""Haha, what a story, Mark,"" and the most infamous ""I did not hit her Oh hi Mark."" For being a bad movie, this film is very quotable. I did not get much humor from the memes before seeing the movie, but after braving through it, I can safely say my life has greatly improved being able to detect The Room references everywhere on the net, which might just be the movie's greatest gift to me.This movie is every bit as bad as advertised. From a filmmaking perspective, it breaks so many rules that I would need to write a college dissertation in order to cover everything. First off, the acting is extremely bad, I mean on an atrocious level with everybody from top to bottom giving their career worst efforts. The director, Tommy Wiseau is technically the worst of them all, but because he was just so dreadful, along with his ridiculous appearance and thick eastern European accent, it actually made him charming. The other actors however, were worse than Disney Channel Original Movies.The script is abysmal and character development is non-existent. Everybody in the film does things randomly without rhyme or reasons, and is inconsistent with their objectives and motivation. Lisa, Johnny's girlfriend, cheats on him with his best friend, Mark, citing the reason being the former is ""boring,"" but then in the next scene, Lisa defends Johnny in front of her mother. Mark, the aforementioned friend, constantly states Johnny is his best friend, yet gives in to Lisa's temptations multiple times, each time acting confused on Lisa's advances to lure him in for intercourse. Johnny having found out Lisa is cheating on him, decides to stay with her anyway because she is his ""future wife,"" but then decides to set up a tape recorder to ""record everything"" as a mean to catch her in the act. Why not just break up with her the moment he finds out? How does showing the evidence to anyone else prove anything when he is the only person in the world this information matters to? The writing is complete nonsense.Throwaway subplots and lot of useless scenes are separated by really long stock footage landscape shots of San Francisco. Wiseau used these shots so liberally he would transition from a room to a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge and then back to the same room again with no passage of time. Many scenes in the movie are without purpose, making me wonder if Wiseau had them in the script or he just decided to shoot whatever he felt like that particular day. What is more peculiar being they contain seemingly vital dialogue that one might believe will pertain later on, but alas that is not the case. Filmmaking 101 dictates if you show a gun in act one, be prepare to use it in act three, except Tommy Wiseau did not get that memo.Loads of unintentional funniness drowns the movie, but I honestly only laughed out loud at a few of them. The best thing about the movie is being able to enjoy all the references and memes you would encounter on the internet afterwards. The quality of the film really lends itself to be spoofed and parodied, only because Tommy Wiseau actually thought he made a romantic drama masterpiece. For all of our benefits, the joke is on him.This is a really bad movie that is strangely enjoyable if you choose to go along with its inadvertent humor. I understand how the movie got such a huge following, since it is immensely quotable with lots of infamously iconic moments, but I do not understand how anyone can truly be a ""fan."" It is one thing to enjoy a movie at an ironic level, but another to become a true fan of a truly awful movie. I do not wish to see this twice, but then again, I would not have to because it will forever be paraded on the internet to remind me of its existence.",The Room
190,bobdude-2,How bad is it?,3,21 June 2012,"The Room - Wow. This movie was wrong on so many levels! Lets start with the acting. Sometimes, er, often, the acting didn't match the script! They would say one thing, but either have no emotion or the wrong emotion! The way Lisa acted, it was really unclear that she was a total lunatic. The way Johnny acted, SPOILER ALERT, I didn't think he cared enough about Lisa that he'd be distraught when she left. Sure, in the script he said it - but the actor never sold it. About that script - ""Don't worry about it!"" A little in joke because at one point Lisa's mom says she has breast cancer, and Lisa says ""Don't worry about it."" So they don't - they never mention it again! This plays right into the wheelhouse of the Rifftrax gang and they don't disappoint. This movie had a few sex scenes (one of them was run twice) and that made the Rifftrax guys uncomfortable - but they did find a way to handle it that was pretty funny.The acting is so bad and the script is horrible, yet the performances are so ripe for making fun of. It is like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" bad. So awful it has become a midnight movie and pop culture phenomenon. Since watching this, I am now in on the jokes that are all over YouTube. I am sure it would be hilarious without Riffrax, but for me it was a lot of fun to watch with Mike and the Gang.SPOILER - At the end, when Johnny kills himself, they linger on the suffering of Lisa and Mark (fiance and best friend who have been doing it behind Johnny's back).

But so many bad movies are just bad: boring, uninteresting, not laugh out loud hilarious. It can be said that comedy cannot be comedy if it is forced, it must be spontaneous to be real comedy. There is no way this movie was originally intended to be bad like this, it took a work of mad genius to create this.And it is mad. Most of the ""dialogue"" is exposition. Characters are described by others and not shown who they are through what they do. Everything's incorrect about filming. I'm not a film student or anything but there's a certain feel about when it's correct in a place of dialogue to cut to the other person. There's a way people interact that's natural, even with bad lines. But these lines are not just delivered badly, they're insane! It's almost indescribable. After viewing this, I've struggled to find other bad movies that are so entertainingly hilarious but I seem to end up just finding boring-unengaging junk, such as battlefield earth. Foodfight! seems like another contender. Usually filmmakers are admonished for churning out bad movies but this movie deserves an applause. I was literally screaming and howling through this. So many ""what just happened?!"" moments. And that flower shop scene, wow. Possibly the pinnacle of film making. And why does this feel like a bad mid 90's made for TV movie? Everyone and everything seemed 90's. Go see this movie!",The Room

194,dmhughes-448-695102,This Really Is The Citizen Kane Of Bad Movies!,1,14 August 2012,"I love movies! I really do, and I am willing to watch almost anything because I believe even the worst films have at least one good thing about them. This film has nothing good in it. Nothing! This particular gem of awfulness was written, produced, and directed by a guy named Tommy Wiseau. He was also the main actor. No one knows where he's from (I think he's Eastern European), but he is such a terrible actor. Every line of dialog he speaks is emotionless, boring, and has this very snooty feeling about it. That's not even the worst part. He can't enunciate his words correctly. Not a single phrase is spoken correctly. It's so bad that it's actually funny. The film is about a guy named Johnny, who works at a bank and lives in an apartment in San Francisco. He lives with his fiancée Lisa, has a best friend named Mark, and a high school/college student named Denny who is is admirer. We never see Johnny at his job; we just see him play football in a tuxedo, and make passionate love with Lisa. However, Lisa becomes bored with him (how does that happen), and she cheats on him with...you guessed it, Mark. I think Wiseau was trying to make a drama about cheating and the negative effects of it, but the film plot is so full of holes that you won't even know what's happening half the time. At least the plot's slightly better than Uwe Boll's films, but that's not saying much. Ultimately, even though I hate this film with a passion, I recommend that people go out and watch it. It's really interesting to see how this project went so bad, and it stands as a lesson to those who want to make movies. It's not as easy as it seems. Even though it's one of the worst films of all time, I recommend that you see it at least once. You'll thank me later. Final Verdict: 1/10* Recommend you see it at least once.",The Room

If it is from Johnny's perspective. He sees himself as a great guy who is loved by all, friends and girlfriend, is brilliant at his job and is a fantastic lover (the way the sex scenes are like a porn movie with him as the star) but in reality his friend and girlfriend cheats on him, she accuses him of hitting her which he denies, he doesn't get the job he thinks he deserves and his whole life falls apart despite him being, in his eyes, a lovely person.

That's how this movie is. You can't believe he can do it and keep it up, but sure enough, he does! I would watch this movie once a week except every time I mention it, my wife becomes enraged. It's so complexly layered with fibers of feces that you have to rewind and replay each few minutes (except the sex scenes, which replay themselves) to catch all the nuances.My voice is hoarse from shouting ""What the hell?!"" over and over. The screenplay seems to be a Mad-lib filled in by patients in an asylum. You can stare at Wiseau's face for minutes on end and still not understand how it is connected together. It's like his makeup artist is M.C. Escher.About a minute into the movie, I get the giggles and they don't stop except when the confusion/badness/outrageousness level gets so high that I have to vent by begging for some sort of explanation.Everything about it is perfect. The sincerity mixed with incompetence. The abject pathos of the autobiographical message mated with the apparently huge ego of the subject. The ambition compared to the final ""output."" As each moment is added to the pile, the silliness increases.It's as if you're at a wedding and a bridesmaid has her skirt tucked into her underwear. It gets funnier and funnier the longer it goes on. And then someone farts. And you are trying so hard not to make any sound because the preacher is talking and he says ""We are gathered her to salivate this holy headlock."" Then the candles catch the bride's veil on fire. And then when they try to put the fire out, the bride starts doing push-ups. It's as if each event is more impossible than the last and there's no explanation, and all the while, you get this sense that someone went to the trouble of making it just like this because that's how he wanted it to be! It truly is like sitting on an atomic bomb that's about to explode.",The Room

How could Johnny's dialog have been written to sound like it was being spoken by a human?2. How could the alley set have been designed to look real and not like a set in a Saturday Night Live sketch?3. Why it is better to shoot on the roof of a building instead of using a green screen to make a parking lot look like a rooftop?4. How would you decorate the indoor sets so they look like a people live there? Count the number of mistakes in the art direction starting with the television facing the wrong direction.5. Why is it not a good idea to cut between two takes during a long dialog scene when one actor is picking up and putting down a wine glass after every sentence?6. How did the disappearing characters and unresolved subplots serve to confuse the viewer?7. Would the loss of a promotion and an unfaithful girlfriend be considered a mortally stressful situation to a character that has not been established to be suffering from emotional problems?8. How would it have improved the story to tell the audience some back story on the characters (where they met, what their jobs are, etc.)?9. Which responses in the dialog seemed inappropriate (laughing about physical abuse, disregarding a potentially fatal disease, shrugging off a person who just tried to kill someone, etc.)? 10. At what point do insert shots of San Francisco become a confusing distraction for the audience instead of serving to set up the next scene?11. Which scenes would have worked better if they had been shot at exterior locations instead of on a cheap sets or an obviously fake roof top?12. What would have made the simulated sex scenes seem closer to actual sex or at least closer to simulated sex?13. Was Johnny's soliloquy about recording phone conversations necessary when it was done right before he walked over to the phone and connected a tape recorder to it?14. When several characters are going to enter at the beginning of a scene, it is better to have them enter in a group, or have them enter one at a time with the door shut and reopened repeatedly?15. When Johnny flips out and starts destroying his bedroom, why does it look more like he's just haphazardly looking for something?16.

They take 'the movies' for granted: just another part of popular culture. 'The Room' can restore that appreciation, not from any virtues which it possesses, but from the lack thereof. In short, The Room is an object lesson in what results from a production lacking artistry. This includes the performances, the script, the photography, the editing, the soundtrack....All these elements lack artistry in this film, and the results are so sadistic, that one will never lack an appreciation for good filmmaking ever again after seeing this movie. Some have described it as a traffic accident. I don't think this really does it justice. You might recall an accident in upstate NY a few years back. It involved an intoxicated mother carrying 5 or 6 children that collided head on with a vehicle with a father and his son riding in it, in which everyone but one child in the mother's car was killed. You catch my drift....After watching The Room, I don't think anyone could ever again be under the impression that good films just happen, or that making films is easy, or that little effort is required. 'The Room' will forever remain a testament to what the art of film sans 'art' is: and for that we owe the producers a debt of gratitude.",The Room

But what I've read leads me to believe that yes, the intent was to make an actual, serious movie. But it views like a perfect dead-on, deadpan parody of the worst possible movie ever. From the ludicrously inept script to the bad soft-core porn scenes to the acting that makes Edith Massey look like Agnes Moorhead - it's just ... mind-crackingly horrid. I am a fan of unintentionally bad movies (The Apple is my favorite so far) But this ... this one takes the cake. I think the line that is said the most often is ""Don't worry about it!"" This line is an all-purpose line that can is said in response to everything from 'I have breast cancer' to 'I am leaving you.' The second-most popular line in this movie is 'I don't want to talk about it.' This is a great device to indicate the characters like to bring things up just for the sake of dropping the topic four seconds later. I confess I had to fast-forward through much of this (like all the sex scenes) But I had to watch Johnny's breakdown. This was like watching someone imitate Christopher Walken sleepwalking. But without any of the passion. I shan't see The Room again. Not only is it aggressively inept, it's tedious. Bad piled upon bad piled upon bad with no sense of direction or purpose is hard to watch for more than ten minutes.

But, before I watched this film, I heard somewhere on YouTube and saw the title ""The Room"" so I assumed it was just some crappy horror film and forgot about it. I had no idea who Tommy Wiseau was, until The Disaster Artist came out. So as you can guess, I got curious. And I watched the film. It was NOT what I thought it was. It was just so weird and odd. It's not just Tommy Wiseau who's odd, every actor in this film seems odd. The film is about a successful banker named Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) who live happily in San Francisco with his fiancée, or ""future wife"" Lisa (Julliete Dannielte). Until she gets board for no reason, and cheats on him with his best friend Mark (Greg Sestro). From there on, nothing will be the same.This is one of those films where it's so bad it's good. And I am a big fan of this movie and can't stop watching it. Tommy Wiseau himself has stated that this film was always meant to be a comedy, so I guess it was never actually meant to be taken seriously.Now, I've talked a lot about the bad stuff, but let's talk about the good stuff.I think the reason why people still watch this film is because it brings people together. All over the world there's midnight screenings of it and people love it and laugh together and throw footballs to each other. It's very funny and I highly recommend it.When I watch The Room today, and don't see a funny cult classic. I see a reflection of an odd but very talented man who had a very clear vision and wanted to share it with the world. I think one thing I love about Tommy Wiseau is, he dosen't care what other people think, and I really respect him for that.

I won't expend my time enumerating them. All of you know which those are.But don't be tricked with this one. This film lets you with a great sensation of emptiness. I felt empty and sad during more than a hour after watching this piece of... After Reading some reviews and bloc entries about the ""cult"" status of this ""the room"" and the iconic shout: ""Your are tearing me apart, Lisa!"" plus the intriguing factor of Tommy Wisseau I decided to give a chance to the film because I thought that, at least, the laughs would be granted. Wrong.Not a single laugh in 90 minutes. Not a single emotion more than a progressive change of mood from apathy to depression.Does it sound overreacted? I'll try to explain the reasons: 1-The acting of the entire cast is immeasurably bad. I don't know how much I going to live (I hope that at least enough to see another 1000 movies) but I'm sure that I'm not going to witness another acting such as crappy as this. 2-Tommy Wiseau. The first I saw his face was in a IMDb's user list and I must recognize that it captivated me. An enigmatic face, worthy of being typical evil troubled villain of a b-series bad movie. But I lost the interest for him in the very first scenes of ""the room"". The worst thing about his acting is he believes he is a first class performer whilst actually he is... he isn't even funny. It's a shame I can't use a better English in order to describe him 3-Was this nightmare's Budget 6 million bucks? In this moment is when I start to cry and when I feel that I would give a huge hug to Wiseau If I were to meet him someday because he's nothing more than a victim. A victim because the entire crew of the film laughed in his face. With 6000 dollars every user of IMDb with a Handy cam, a microphone, 6 Friends and a PC would have made a better experiment than this.In conclusion, don't waste your time watching this.

Then we got a gratuitous sex scene that lasted way to long, then we saw Lisa talking to her mother about how she doesn't love him anymore, then she cheats on Johnny with his best friend, and soon I noticed a pattern happening in the plot. Gratuitous sex scene, Lisa talks to mother, Lisa cheats with Mark, rinse and repeat. Eventually the story does go somewhere, without flagging myself for spoilers, let's just say it has an unintentionally hilarious grand finale.

And he's also about to get married to Lisa who's in some computer business of some kind but she's having an affair with Mark, Johnny's best friend, who does not want to hurt Johnny but clearly can't help himself. Danny, Johnny and Lisa's young sexually confused neighbour who has problems of his own somewhat related to drugs and football fetching, doesn't suspect a thing although he's always hovering about and is also in love with Lisa but would rather watch Lisa and Johnny in bed when he's not fetching Johnny's balls. The only person who knows what is afoot between Johnny and Lisa is Lisa's mother who begs her daughter to come to her senses but in vain since no one listens to her and... she's dying... since she DEFINITELY has breast cancer (which is okay since ""they're curing people everyday""). Confused? Well don't be...And welcome to the wondrous world of ""The Room"". This is a world from the breathtaking lack of imagination of Tommy Wiseau, the least appealing man ever to walk this Earth; a world where people play football in tuxedo, have the same conversations again and again due to their 5 minutes memory, make babies by humping belly buttons in the middle of rose petals and finally enter and exit places without any other reason than to do just that.Indeed, this is probably one of the worst film ever made but as opposed to any other cinematic turd, this one is hardly ever dull (except for the ""sex"" scenes maybe), the aimless plot driven through one stupidity to the other by the on-par grammar-school writing delivering gems galore (""I'm so happy I have you as my best friend and I love Lisa so much"", ""I'm tired. I'm wasted. I love you darling""), the final broth served by inept performances (for want of a better word) from its cast. This is truly the most inspired disaster ever committed to screen.But what I find the most interesting about the ""The Room"" is its maker Tommy Wiseau. ""The Room"" is a window into his confused psyche because make no mistake folks: Tommy IS Johnny. And what are we told about Johnny? Well that ""he's very caring about the people in his life"", provides for his girlfriend, ""is very sensitive"", ""doesn't drink"", ""has a very secure situation"" and has nice pecs. Quite a catch wouldn't you say ladies? On paper possibly... Because everything about his persona seems phoney: his accent which is a mix of anyone's that ever walk this planet whom couldn't speak English, his over-sized suit, his dark, long and way too greasy hair, his geriatric body posture, his re-shaped and re-muddled face and, above all, his completely dry and humourless laughter (and not in a sarcastic way either). Such a penchant for dissimulation is downright creepy and I must admit, the physical repulsion he exerts on me is the stuff fascination is made of.The fact that ""The Room"" has gathered such a cult following is no surprise. In the oh-so jaded times we're living in, celebrating the mediocre, talentless and pointless have become all the rage with the recipient of the mockery confusing infamy with fame. There is something both pathetic and a little unsettling about how Tommy Wiseau regards the cynical interests his movie has attracted for a genuine recognition of his talent.Mind you, I suppose Mr Wiseau can take pride in the fact that ""The Room"" will go down in Cinema history. But as what?",The Room

Oh and his fiancee, Lisa, just wants to get her top off at every opportunity and get snoggy with her lover, despite the fact that at one point her future husband and other partygoers have left the room less than 10 seconds ago!It is so shockingly bad that it veers into brilliance.But the only reason I would ever watch it again is if I had accidentally given myself a lobotomy that had gone horribly wrong.I can only tell friends that they ought to watch it to make them feel better about watching any other film that they thought was bad, but compared to this, is probably actually pretty good.Confused?You will be.",The Room
228,tefen,A Telling of the Modern American Women,9,20 June 2018,"In all honesty I actually enjoyed this movie and did not think it was bad like everyone else does. It is sickening how shallow, uncaring, and horrible people are these days that they just laugh at this and find it humorous. The movie both exposes what the typical Modern American/Western Women has become and at the same time it exposes how horrible, heartless, and ill-minded the people are that watch this and laugh about it. Being cheated on by the love of your life with someone you thought was your friend is not a funny thing to go through in life and I only hope that the people who laugh at this may one day have to endure the same thing themselves. Maybe then they will understand, however I doubt they will even care or even genuinely love the person they are with and probably cheat on them all the time. If you are reading this ""Tommy Wiseau"" please know that at least 1 person genuinely enjoyed your film and found it emotionally moving. It is not you who failed at making a good movie, it is like your movie shows with modern women failing to be good people that modern Americans fail to be good people.",The Room

While watching the video, I also saw a thumbnail that says ""Everything Wrong with The Room"" and I thought it doesn't seem interesting at first. When I used to watch Nostalgia Critic, I saw his review video of The Room and I still think it doesn't seem interesting. Later, when I saw the interview of Tommy Wiseau about the film, I feel bad about how he feels about the bad reviews of the movie. When I finally saw the film, I noticed that the writing needs a lot of work, however I really find this film very interesting. The only thing that I like about the film the most (especially that interest me to watch this film) is how Tommy Wiseau was trying to tell a simplistic and interesting story. I went to Stan Lee's LA ComicCon in 2017 and I'd get to meet Tommy Wiseau, I thought he was a cool guy. How I met him there was that I was at his aisle and I never thought a filmmaker would sell copies of his script and I was trying to decide (even that it's tough) and I also was telling him that I'm not sure if whether or not if I want to buy a copy of the script and I also thought it was nice for him to have me read the script as I'm deciding. So, I bought the script anyway. I enjoyed The Room because of the story and I liked it better than Birdemic.",The Room

234,fabkingcliff,"""There are bad movies. There are so-bad-it's-good movies. Then there's The Room, a movie that is so bad it defies comprehension.""",2,14 November 2014,"Where do I begin, because I have come to realize there are no words in any language that are fit enough to describe the travesty that is The Room. Horrific, dull, mediocre, amateurish, ridiculous, apathetic, all these words come to mind but fail to aptly describe the disaster that this film is so popular for being. And make no mistake, the reason behind this cataclysmic horror show strongly stems from the undeniable and lethal contribution of the lead actor- who so magically also happens to be the director, writer and producer of the film- Mr. Tommy Wiseau. All along throughout the movie I have relentlessly tried to unveil the mystery behind his being so astronomically awkward and overly inhuman, but to no avail. The way he talked, walked, laughed and his overall demeanor seemed out of this world.My only question is how can one appear so profoundly mentally unstable, and originate from an advanced extraterrestrial civilization at the same time? Because that's what Wiseau is to me, an alien. Not to be too negative about his performance though because he genuinely tried his best to act human, although he failed beyond analogy. My conscience will never be able to digest this impostor of a film, because its eccentricity is too solid to be broken down into smaller matter for mental digestion. A film which, at best, conjures an Ed-woodian vision albeit utopical, and instigates psychosomatic self-harm in the viewer. This is without a shroud of doubt the fourth worst movie ever made. Ever. Its preceding contenders being Plan 9 from Outer Space, Troll 2 and Birdemic: Shock and Terror in their respective descending order. Normally when I write a review I will start off by giving a brief note on the storyline but this time I didn't because, well, there is no storyline. The only thing harder to believe than the awfulness of The Room is its mind boggling self-financed budget, a good $1 million, half of which was doubtlessly spent on promoting it and shooting countless takes of the same scene because Tommy Wiseau had a hard time remembering the incomprehensible lines he wrote himself. I read somewhere mind you, that Wiseau had originally included a subplot which would reveal that Johnny, his character, is actually a vampire.I'll let that sink in.There is a plethora of mysteries in the world and third of them are embedded in The Room. Things remain unexplained like irrelevant scenes that contribute nothing to the development of the plot; scenes like when age decrepit Denny, out of place Mark and some bi-dimensional random character (probably played by a spare crew member with about as much acting experience as an Egyptian Pharaoh) are tossing a football around and when the guy spontaneously trips and falls softly apparently breaking a few vertebrae, they all decide to go back inside the house with no indication what impact it has on the story. Or should I talk about the sudden inexplicable mood swings that the characters seem to be experiencing, like when Johnny is apparently in rage and goes to the rooftop cursing and arguing with himself over his girlfriend who's claiming domestic abuse, only to find his friend Mark there and say, in a an oddly quite cheerful manner ""Oh Hi Mark,""Did I mention The Room has more continuity than CCTV footage? Tommy Wiseau's delusory attempt at cinema is nothing like his counterpart James Nguyen's with Birdemic: Shock and Terror. Nguyen at least steered his supernatural crapfest with stark albeit dubious earnest. Wiseau on the hand assembled his cinematic tour-de-force with resonating apathy, shoulder-shrug level determination and an impetuous attitude that echoes throughout his masterpiece. I could sit here and go through this film illustrating flaw, ineptitude and shortcoming but my time is far too precious to be spent on a preschool film project that is but utter conversion of garbage material into filmstrip. I haven't the slightest idea what message this film was trying to put out there, but it did give a faint hint on love, romance and the ups and downs of relationships (or the Tommy Wiseau's twisted personal view on these subjects) which will only be perceived by the keen-eyed and the one who manages not to fall asleep or commit suicide before the end credits.""It's not true, I did not hit her, she's lying I did not hit her I did naat.""I was mentally tortured to sit through 100 minutes of unprecedented depiction of human interaction, the exacerbating diction of Tommy Wiseau's character (not forgetting Wiseau's unidentifiable accent that could only suggest brain damage inflicted speech impediment) and his own ethereal demeanor. All the aforementioned traits merely being characteristic of the actor's own psyche by the way. Thanks dear producers, that is Tommy Wiseau, Tommy Wiseau and Tommy Wiseau. ""You're tearing me apart Lisa!"" Actually you have to witness the way he delivers this particular line to believe it. You have to. You've never seen anything like it before.This entire film looks like a bunch of Martian green men trying to re-enact human behavior in not-so everyday situations, needless to illustrate the results.The Room is an insult and a great crime committed to celluloid, while Mr. Wiseau and his team are gargantuan degenerates of biblical proportions.P.S everyone on the planet should see the final scene where Johnny is on a self-destructive rampage.

235,michael_balsdon,The Passion of Tommy: The Movie,4,19 February 2018,"After multiple viewings of The Room there is a sense of passion that springs from the film and I'm not talking about the films numerous, god awful sex scenes. I'm talking about the passion that a director has for his film. You can criticise Tommy Wiseau's acting, script writing and ability to act like a human being but at the end of the day he set out to make and film and he did. His final film isn't the drama that he wanted but watching it you can see how he wanted some of his scenes to just ooze tradegy and raw emotion (Your'e Tearing Me Apart Lisa!!) but Wiseau's execution fails to deliver this. The Room is not the worst film ever made but it sure as hell isn't the best either. It is just one of the most unique films ever made and viewings of it are more memorable and fun than viewings of other more mainstream films.",The Room
236,BronnFlakes,A bad movie that is more memorable than Hollywood's best offerings.,10,28 March 2016,"It takes a special kind of terrible movie to be this magical. From the moment Tommy Wiseau's odd character walks onto the screen, you're hooked from start to finish.Starring as Johnny, Tommy Wiseau's acting is majestic in its awfulness as he awkwardly recites his lines in a manner that is not dissimilar to a computerized voice rereading your typed words back to you in a profoundly hilarious and incomprehensible fashion. To describe Tommy as robotic or wooden would be an understatement, but the absolute lack of any acting ability is what makes his performance so engaging. I won't even go into his habit of letting out borderline creepy subtle laughs at the most inappropriate of times. That is something else entirely, and it is just another piece of the confusingly hilarious and mind-meltingly unsolvable puzzle that is Tommy Wiseau. To see Tommy attempting to act his way through this movie is like watching a baby take its first steps. It's an adorable disaster that you will never forget.Tommy's co-stars aren't any better in their awfulness. Johnny's on-screen best friend is Mark, a Sears catalogue model who fumbles through his lines with a curious lack of commitment and has a propensity for violently slamming young men into stacks of garbage cans. Johnny's fiancée, Lisa, is a deeply disturbed woman with a habit of removing her clothes at random. Lisa may or may not be a sadistic sociopath due to her unreasonable and almost unpredictable behaviour in this jewel of a movie.Last but not least of the main characters... is Denny. Denny is the teenage neighbour of Johnny and Lisa who has an almost creepy obsession with Lisa. Denny wants nothing more than to watch Johnny and Lisa have intercourse, or to kiss Lisa. These dark fantasies are shared with his friend Johnny, who seems oddly at ease with the boy's disturbingly abnormal tendencies. Even when Denny jumps and rolls around on the bed with Johnny and Lisa in their pre-intercourse shenanigans, playfully exclaiming that he 'wants to watch', everyone is frighteningly okay with the boy. Denny also has a drug addiction problem, which results in one of the movie's most delightful scenes involving a screaming drug dealer who just may be the best actor in the movie. Do note that I state this fact quite joyously, because the acting in this movie really is tremendously bad in the most beautiful way imaginable.I don't dare spoil the movie's main plot between Johnny and Lisa, nor will I even dare mention the delightful performance given by the actress portraying Lisa's mother (it is just so beautiful in its awfulness). This movie is just such a glorious train wreck that defies logic and must not be spoiled! The Room is, undoubtedly, the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Despite this, it somehow manages to be unforgettable in its awfulness and remains more memorable in my mind than the greatest of Hollywood offerings. Imagine if the worst movies by Ed Wood and Uwe Boll had a baby together and starred an army of robots that had the acting parameters of Hayden Christensen installed into them. Even that description fails to capture the magical essence of The Room. This movie is terrible, make no mistake, but it is almost beautiful in its awfulness.This movie needs to be watched by anyone and everyone, simply because this is a one of a kind movie that perfectly captures everything that can go wrong with the production of a movie. We will never see its kind again - (oh, hi) mark my words.",The Room
237,dickyboy-77591,Hilarious?,4,25 October 2019,It's funny without trying to be. I get why there was a film made about this film.,The Room
238,mrdjx,"The funniest worst, and therefore one of the greatest movies ever made.",10,6 December 2010,"Last night, I engaged in a long conversation with my brothers girlfriend. Although my memory is unclear due to the hammering effects of drinking three cocktails, there is one thing I still remember. She declared Legally Blonde as ""the worst movie ever.""Having seen LegalIy Blonde, I challenged her by reminding her that she had not seen The Room, although she had endured the Nostalgia Critics infamous review of it. While both films are bad, there is a distinguishing difference between a bad film like Legally Blonde and a bad film like The Room. You see, Legally Blonde is bad because like many mainstream films, it has shallow characters. The Room is bad because it fails on every conceivable level that a film can fail which is why it has been dubbed by some academics and as ""the Citizen Kane of bad movies"". Because Citizen Kane is often cited as ""the greatest movie ever made"", The Room is therefore ""the worst movie ever made"" even if the title that has long been held by Plan 9 From Outer Space for well over thirty years. However as bad as The Room is, it delivers unintentional laughs in bucket loads. Go onto Youtube and look up ""Hi doggy/Flower shop scene."" If you aren't amused by the obvious scripting and editing errors, not to mention the downright bizarre mis en scene, then clearly there must be something wrong with you. The Room is the story of Johnny (played by writer/ director, Tommy Wiseau), a banker who is about marry his longtime fiancé, Lisa (Juliette Danielle) . After an unnecessarily long and detailed love scene that is briefly interrupted by the perverted Denny who just likes to watch. Lisa figures she is bored of Johnny, and decides to invite his friend Mark (Greg Sestero) over so she can have a talk that involves having sex on a spiral staircase. Drama inevitably ensures, through several convoluted plot points that are instantly dropped before everything climaxes in true Shakespearean style.One of the great features of The Room is how amazingly repetitive the dialogue is. Every time a character enters a set, they are always greeted with lines like ""oh hi Mark"", ""oh hi Denny"" , ""oh hi doggy"". The ""oh hi"" phrase is repeated so often, it's almost as if Tommy thought they were necessary to remind us that the scene has now changed. But that's not the only thing he reminds us about. Every time Lisa seduces Mark, he always declares ""Johnny is my best friend"". At several points in the film, Lisa's mother ,Claudette comes in to remind us that by cheating on her fiancé, Lisa is going to suffer deep financial troubles. If you want see what plot driven dialogue looks like in its most unsubtle, non character driven form, look no further.The character interactions are also monotonous. In the films first half hour, we see three sex scenes that are ridiculously gratuitous to the point of nearly being soft core. The only way for Johnny to hang out with his friends is to play football. Johnny laughs even if friends tell him something that wasn't meant to be funny or ironic. The limited character interactions are not helped by the acting either. Never before seeing the famous ""I did NUHT"" moment, had I ever seen acting that was so detached and void of any convincing emotion that replacing the actors with Hayden Christiansen or even the HAL 9000 computer could actually mark an improvement. And yet, because of its sheer level of badness combined with Wiseau's love of film, The Room represents a rare feat in cinema. Its success is the kind that many would be directors have wished for. Yes it's a bad amateur film by a clueless first time director . But like many of the best films like Quentin Tarrantino's Pulp Fiction, or Monty Python and The Holy Grail, it delivers scene after unforgettable scene with schizophrenic writing that's hilarious enough to deliver the kind of joy that could finally give Super Mario an erection after twenty five years of sexless marriage.The Room came out in 2003, the same year that gave us hits like The Matrix sequels, Bruce Almighty, Terminator 3 and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle which all made millions at the box office. But none of those films are likely to be quoted five years from now. By contrast The Room is much worse than those films and vanished into thin air upon release. It has since attracted an ever growing cult with some fans who were dedicated enough to faithfully adapt it into a video game.Yes, the films I've listed are bad. But they do not have the passion that The Room has to reach for a high level artistic greatness. And because the film aims so high, it fails so hard. Because it fails so hard, it is without doubt the worst film ever made. But because the film often aims so high and fails so hard, it is without doubt one of the funniest and therefore greatest films ever made. Wiseau did not make the masterpiece he wanted to make, but he still made one. I think that's enough to satisfy any director.

At least one reviewer mentioned the legendary ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" in comparison, but I feel this film excels over the latter in certain areas such as crude acting, a muddled plot and strange, unappealing and undeveloped characters. Still, I reluctantly feel compelled to give it a 2 if only because of the appealing visuals of San Francisco (which are nonetheless odd for a film that wasn't primarily filmed in San Francisco, aside from the second-unit footage; wikipedia's article on the film relates that the rooftop scenes were filmed against a green screen with the city added in afterward). Instead of keeping this film in its current anonymous region of mediocrity with a mixture of very high and low votes, perhaps true fans should pitch in to plunge this film downward toward a place alongside other unique visions like ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"". Indeed, this film reminds me a great deal of ""Manos"" insofar as both were made by people outside the Hollywood mainstream (not so much the case with ""Plan 9""'s Ed Wood); ""Manos"" is a bit more lucid than this film, but both share a similar kind of entertainment value for people who appreciate just how far this medium can be pushed and still be recognizable.",The Room

There was me, Stephan, Mason and Shane who are all male and Anna, Katie, Zoe and Gina who are female (I'm saying this just so I can establish and go into more detail about one of our reactions later) and all of us had different reactions to what we were seeing. Me, Mason Anna and Katie were looking on in confusion throughout the whole thing, Stephen and Shane were laughing uncontrollably, Gina was offended and Zoe fell asleep.There was just so much stuff wrong in this thing that I repeatedly asked the question ""why was this made? What possessed Tommy Wiseau to make this? Did he intentionally make this bad? Did he make this to settle debt? Did he actually think he could become a memorable film director?"" I can only answer one of those questions, he became a memorable film director/producer/writer/actor but for the wrong reasons.Where do I start? The acting is some of the worst caught on camera. I was in an amateur theatre production by Queen's hall arts called Minor's Strike and I would like to emphasise, it was an amateur production and all of our acting was praised in the performance and I was 13 at the time. These actors, who are around their 30s/40s are acting worse than we did and we were amateurs and hadn't taken acting school at the time. Tommy Wiseau is easily the worst though. He is the worst actor and this film and what goes well with a bad actor you might ask? Badly written dialogue for this bad actor to spout out.""We have a new client at the bank we make a lot of money, anyway how is your sex life"" This is an actual piece of dialogue that was delivered by Tommy Wiseau, imagine that an 8 year old French boy is saying this line and you will get Tommy Wiseau's whole performance.There are also these really uncomfortable sex scene moments which is what Gina was offended by. I know that we're in an age where the ESRB raters are awfully sceptical about letting certain age demographics watch certain movies and usually controversy is applauded by audience and that's why Harvester and Hatred got as much attention as they did but this thing in The Room, these sex scenes which is applauded by possibly the horn word (not allowed to say it because of IMDb's rules) teenage boy demographic, these sort of scenes are just plain awkward for people to sit through. Also, there is about 5 of these uncomfortable sex scenes in this film, each lasting about 5 mins. Which means the total amount of time we spent watching some porno was just under 1/3 of the film.There are also these really weird scenes that don't go anywhere. They happen and then that's it.I wish there was a way that I could unsee this film and none of you get this film, even if you're curious, don' get it.

But sitting down to watch this as a delusional vanity project gone awry and it becomes one of the best 90 minutes you'll get out of a film.The Room is what the result would be if an alien species studied late 90's soap opera TV, had a computer program amalgamate a script and then was performed by the aliens in human skin like the first Men In Black movie.There's a sad truth in film though. While its a mess, its clearly written from some place of truth or experience in Tommy Wiseau's heart.

Wow.Tommy Wiseau's tour de force is considered by many one of the worst, if not THE worst movie ever made. I agree. Totally. There's just so much wrong on every front. The acting is atrocious. Nobody is even remotely close to be considered an actual actor; Wiseau's line delivery is painful to watch. It's as if he was bored or annoyed by the lines he himself wrote. Speaking of lines, the script. Most of the time it doesn't make sense. The same dialogues are repeated various times during the movie. For example, Lisa and her mother always have the same conversation, with a few minor changes. To say it gets tedious is an understatement. New characters come into the story with no actual purpose and without being properly introduced. It gets confusing, to say the least. Too many love making scenes that are too long and weird, even. In the first 26 minutes, I counted three sex montages. THREE! The music is dull and repetitive. Technically speaking, I honestly can save nothing. So yeah, it's terrible. But because of that, it's hilarious!This movie has become a cult. I've always heard about it and now I can see why. It's so funny that it makes you wonder whether Tommy Wiseau is the biggest troll of all time or this was his serious effort to make a movie. His acting is the worst among one of the worst actor ensemble I've ever seen in a movie. Honestly, he is the main reason for the ""success"" of the picture. There are so many memorable lines, made famous by his delivery and his emotionless face. ""You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"" is one of them. It's just so funny, man! There's so many more elements that make this movie such a cult loved by many. However, I don't want to say too much. I advise you to watch, if you haven't already.

Now I will admit that the movie is not for everyone. Heck, it's literally just for Mr. Wiseau---but it's noteworthy, to me, if just for the fact that someone said, ""Ah dun care wha any bahdy say! Ah will make dream movie! People, they use me; they lie to me and I dun care any more---oh, hai Greg!"". Tommy made his dream come true; put his stupid heart on the line and succeeded in his failure! He made a negative, a positive and that's pretty hard to do sometimes! So while it is not a great movie, it's a great example of what someone can do if they really put effort into their selves...",The Room

249,Extraneus92,"Everything about this is appalling, but it forms something special",10,27 October 2013,"The Room is perhaps one of the most spectacular films that I have ever witnessed. I have never seen anything so inept and troubled in my life. Indeed, there is something so pathologically wrong with The Room that somehow you can't quite help but applaud it while at the same time feeling like you must take a shower. Central to the film is Tommy Wiseau; the man in charge of the production. When exploring the background surrounding the film it can be noticed that Wiseau went to extreme lengths to make certain that this film be created. He wrote it as a novel and somehow managed to raise $6 million for the production of it. In fact practically every story I hear surrounding the making of this film is hilarious. This film is Wiseau's centrepiece, it feels as if it's his life's work. Yet, he doesn't stop at purely making it, he stars in it too. Wiseau plays the role of Johnny, an Angelic figure devoted to his ""future wife"" Lisa (who is perhaps one of the biggest enigmas to ever appear on the big screen). Johnny is certainly something special; without him this film would not be what it is. He is the central orb in which the rest of this tragedy collapses around. He is perhaps the most complicated character ever created; some believe he is from Croatia, Belgium, Norway, Finland and I've heard Denmark too. Whatever country he is from, he certainly isn't American as Wiseau has claimed. Heck, I still wonder whether he's even of this world. Whatever the conclusion, Johnny is perhaps one of the greatest characters to ever come into creation. The entirety of this film is almost as if it was written by someone who had never been part of any society. The whole thing makes no sense, it's almost nihilistic in the way that it redefines the framework of rules in film. Though, it has been claimed by the staff to be deliberately terrible. This was something quickly admitted to. However, I'm not truly sure that it was intentionally this awful. I think that there was a fair bit of effort put into it, certainly by Wiseau. Whatever the belief, this film manages to do everything horribly wrong, nothing about this, not one scene was something that I thought was lucid. It is a burning trainwreck of awfulness. But amongst the rubble it leaves you amazed at the sheer level of ineptness that you have just witnessed. It leaves you with a need to watch it again. Overall, The Room is a piece of genius that only a severely mentally ill person could ever create and pull off to the level that Wiseau has.",The Room
250,rockdiscipline-223-142251,Tommy Wiseau is my new Idol.,10,13 March 2017,"Let me get one thing straight. If you think you gonna read some sarcastic trash talk that makes fun of this movie you are wrong. Now that there is no room for any confusion here I go with my review. There are 2 crucial scenes that I cannot forget about this movie. Firstly: The scene where Johnny tells Mark "" I think you should leave right now mark"" after mark tells johnny ""Lisa changed her mind about you wake up man what plan are you on?"" Secondly: The scene where johnny kills himself and lies on the ground while mark Lisa and Denny still have some lines to say before the movie ends. In both scenes Tommy Wiseau's face and acting were so convincing that it just put me through a roller coaster of emotions. I mean I was just having fun, making fun of the scenes prior to these every thing was so funny the lines were so original and out of this world and at the same time hilarious the acting was theatrical, exaggerated and therefore can be considered bad for a movie... It didn't make any sense it was like watching an absurd comedy. But here is the important part for me. After these two scenes that I mentioned I wasn't laughing anymore. I was at such a state that I didn't give a single flying fudge about how nonsense the previous scenes about the movie were how I was making fun of the characters, the lines, the atmosphere, the conversations... none of these mattered at that point. I really felt sorry for what johnny was going through. Anyways in the end this original movie indeed changed my life. I wish I had watched it 14 years ago then by now I would be a much better man I'm sure of it. I always wanted to enjoy the life at its maximum limits. Think of a situation that you jumped from an airplane unwillingly without a parachute. What will you do at that point? will you cry knowing that inevitable death awaits you in a few seconds? (by the way according to a myth I heard in such situation you will die of a heart attack mid air because of the intense fear of death) or do you have the capacity to enjoy the feeling of the free fall despite the fact that you know you are going to die after you hit the ground so hard that your internal organs will scatter inside you? I dare you to think of this. Now I believe Tommy Wiseau is such a man, such a genius that would do the latter in this situation. This is what he did with his masterpiece The Room. He enjoyed the free fall.",The Room

Sure some scenes have absolutely no meaning or relevance but that didn't stop them appearing! As the saying goes- build it and they shall come, or something like that. Like the film I try not to dwell on fact or meaning here.

253,mmatsinger77,This movie is tearing me apart!,3,11 October 2013,"I gave this film a pretty generous rating. The only reason I gave it something above a 1 is because I couldn't stop laughing the whole entire time. A messily scripted and poorly acted display of irritating accents and painfully awkward sex scenes, The Room is pretty much only good for a laugh. I mean that in the nicest way possible. No. Not really. After watching this film, I am left unsatisfied with the pretty much nonexistent plot and disturbing amount of goofs involved in it. Specifically, the flower shop scene. It is as if the actors only had 45 seconds to film the scene, and they had never looked at their lines and just read over them a couple of times before rushing on set. There are so many things wrong with this movie, including but not limited too the amount of times that Johnny says ""Hi"" to any given person, particularly Mark, and the awkward laugh that Johnny seems to force from his throat at the strangest times, including just before one of those terrible sex scenes. Despite my bad review, I would not say that my time spent watching The Room was wasted. I recommend this film in the highest regard. It's so bad that it's good! It is fantastic for having a night getting drunk with your friends, or to get one of your emotional friends to smile after a breakup. Enjoy this terribly wonderful film.",The Room

And wow, this character talks like he took lessons from Schwarzenegger and Stallone's School of English. So yeah, it's not hard to see why this film became a pretty big cult favorite. It's not often you see a film that is so bad. The captain of this ship is director/ producer/ writer/ executive producer and main actor Tommy Wiseau. Well, we don't have to spend a lot of words to describe the acting- part, seeing the guy can't even talk properly. And seeing the acting of all the other actors, it's safe to say Wiseau is as good as an actor as he is as a director.But Wiseau probably sucks the most as a writer. I mean, has anyone ever seen something so incredibly stupid? Characters come and go, people talk about stuff out of nowhere and nothing seems to make any sense. The entire movie Wiseau and his friends (and a weird kid that should join forces with the kid from Burial Ground: Nights of Terror) just throw a ball, while his boring girlfriend is having boring talks with her boring mother about boring stuff.

255,countrymuzluvr,Plan 9 is Oscar worthy compared to this nonsense,1,31 March 2010,"I read through about 20 of the 84 reviews for this movie and I started wondering if everyone had seen the same movie as me. I saw reviews that raved about the movie but gave it a 1 out of 10. I just finished watching it on Cartoon Network of all places. The acting was horrible. None of the actors in this film were believable. The story line was complete drivel. It barely held my interest. I've had more fun watching grass grow.At the end of the movie, just before ""Johnny"" shoots himself over his fiancé's betrayal, Johnny lifts a TV over his head and throws it out a window. You can easily tell that the TV is fake because Johnny acts like it weighs next to nothing. Any decent actor would at least make it look like it was heavy.I don't understand how so many people can watch this movie and say it was one of the best films they had ever seen.

258,psychoartus,Cult Classic,7,24 July 2010,"by mindselfThere are a lot of horrendous things in this world. Some of it we can tolerate and some of it is demeaning. But what if it's something we can enjoy and have fun with? What if it's the film The Room?The film stars Tommy Wiseau, who also directed, written, and is the producer of, and it's about Wiseau character, Johnny, struggle and realization that he's caught up in a love triangle – and that's basically it. Really though, that's basically it. The film has a cult following as being the worst film ever made and you know what? They're right. Not only is it poorly directed, written and produce, it's also poorly thought out. That's the enjoying factor of it though. Like people say, no one goes out and make bad films purposely and I don't think Wiseau was intended to do so but this film is created like film 101.First off, there's far too many sex scenes. The first four minutes into the film, you get a long and unflattering sex scene that's also very fanciful and amateurish. It makes Showtime channel's softcore porn look first-class. There's about four sex scenes that bares an unattractive woman and an unusual male rear end. Not tantalizing at all. Also during each sex scene there's horrible R&B music that seem to come out of the era of the 90s. This was made in 2003.The actors seem to do a decent job – no not really, they're horrible too. There are no major stars just the usual up and coming actors and actress trying to make a buck. I mean, I can't act but I know when someone is trying, they seem like they're reading their lines instead of acting it out. I guess that's the joy of it though. Each scene is open when someone enters the room and ends when someone leaves the room. The dialogue comes as being very cliché and awful. Here are excerpts from the film:Conversation between Johnny (Wiseau) and his best friend Mark (Sestero):Mark: How was work today? Johnny: Oh pretty good. We got a new client at the bank. We make a lot of money. Mark: What client? Johnny: I can not tell you, its confidential. Mark: Oh come on. Why not? Johnny: No I can't. Anyway, how is your sex life?Here's another between Johnny and his 'future wife' Lisa (Danielle):Lisa: Did you get your promotion? Johnny: Nah. Lisa: You didn't get it, did you.As you can tell some of the the dialogue is also condescending and cringeworthy. Again, that's the enjoyment of the film. It takes itself too seriously that it's so funny. There's countless unintentional humor in this film. Whether that be the character of the awkward Denny, who I have no idea why he's in the film, to the numerous times of playing catch with a football (you'll see) everything is design as if he wanted to make the worst film of all time. I don't know if he intended to do so, but if it was, then the film would lose it's magic. It's great because it's bad, very bad. I would love to go into great detail but I really want you to watch it. I recommend the film just because it needs to be watch once in your life. You'll probably regret it, but I'm sure you'll have a couple of chuckles.I had this thesis that this film is a huge metaphor. Lisa is ""The Room"" and Johnny is the ""audience"". Go in with that thought and it might blow your mind, literally.SPOON!!!!! (you'll know what I mean when you watch it)",The Room
259,narrowfilm,an incompetent masterpiece,10,31 May 2006,"is it possible that tommy wiseau intended the film to be a ""black comedy"" all along, as the posters would lead one to believe? i don't think so - to have made a film this incompetent on almost every level is nothing short of a miracle. that's right, ""the room"" is a miracle, part of the holy trinity of bad movies that includes ""troll 2"" and ""dangerous men"" (another work of genius), and maybe even ""the apple"" depending on who you talk to (but then that wouldn't really be a trinity anymore, would it?). ***SPOILERS***the film is full of many brilliant cinematic devices. the sight of tommy wiseau's naked torso causes men and women to scream in terror, as does ""pleasantly plump"" juliette danielle's throbbing neck. could it be that images like these were inspired by wiseau's deep affection for the cinema of David Cronenberg? wiseau also has a mastery of staging that is unheralded in modern cinema, as is evinced by the scene in which denny and lisa kneel on the ground with an empty chair visible in the foreground of the shot. i have a feeling that the empty chair is not insignificant, or as claudette would say, ""that is not nothing!"" on the subject of claudette, i feel that in addition to her ""definite"" case of breast cancer she may suffer from dementia as well, given that she and lisa seem to have nearly identical conversations every time they share the screen. she may want to get that checked out. and you may want to check out ""the room."" it will change your life and the lives of those around you forever. in the words of wiseau, ""you may not like it, but you will learn something. that's what entertainment is: the process of learning.""",The Room

261,haxboob,Behold Johnny: The Vampire who will show them all by recording what they say,10,18 March 2004,"Well let me start by admitting that I have seen this movie 4 times now...dedicated lover of the arts?  or dumbass with nothing else better to do with his time, your choice. That being said I will go on to say that I have figured out what is going on with the horror-fying truth surrounding The Room...or should I say The Coffin of Lies! believe what you want, but this movie was no mistake.  Vampires do exist and his name is Tommy Wiseau.  Come with me now as I take you down a path of some Bullet-Points-of-Truth: 1.  First off, all Wampires LOVE to overdecorate with candles, rose petals and white mosquito netting draped romantically over the bed.  No grown heterosexual man, San Fransisco native or no, decorates like that unless he has death for the innocent on his mind. 2.  SPOON!  Or should I say ancient device for killing blonde booby-licious girls. So dear is this ancient weapon that he has HIS photographed and FRAMED! 3.  The fact that Lisa, who has been around Johnnys Vampire character long enough, has formed telephathic skills powerful enough to make an entire room full of people think that they should all go OUTSIDE in the middle of a party so that she can do a little sucky-sucky of her own (on the ultra-handsome Greggy Sestero!), then using her mind powers moments later to get them all, like cattle, to go back INSIDE when she wants to suck on some cake. 4.  Unexplained Tuxedo scene - Vampires love to overdress and hang out in alleys playing football, or should I say deathball as the poor psychiatrist is lobbed the offending ball and ends up falling down and disappearing from the movie altogether.  Play Psychiatrist with us will you!?5.  Vampires often use their powers to keep people off-kilter and confused. Note Mark always asking ""what are you doing"" and ""whats going on here?"" as well as Lisas inability to put her finger on what exactly it is that she does in ""the computer business"" that is so hard.  Or the fact that Johnny's Vampire character makes himself dizzy at times and tells people about his non-descript ""job in the banking industry"" which he clearly hates because people in the banking industry steal his money making ideas, probably old-fashioned jealousy over that  Ancient European banking industry hair style...long and black my friends, Not too obvious VAMPIRE! 6.  Denny has drug problem, drug dealer Chris-R shows up with gun, threats are made and bad acting ensues, Johnny-Vampire shows up....Chris-R gone from movie forever.  No goodbye, no ""be back tomorrow for my money"", just gone from scene and gone from our minds.  what!  huh?  gotta get me one of them Vampires to deal with my boss and that bitch in accounting who thinks her donuts are so freaking great. 7.  The taking away of deadly breast cancer.  God curses old woman with it, old woman blandly accepts imminent death from it, Vampire takes it away.  Gone and forgotten.  No thanks necessary, I'll shoot myself later for having loved you all too much.Oh theres so much more, but I think you'll make the connections on your own.What does this have to do with Tommy being a Vampire as well?  Honey please, that hair, he always wears black, you can't put a finger on his true age (45-62?) only a vampire could acquire that fright physique and we all know that Vampires like to screw their partners in the lower abdomen...hence the uncomfortable sex scenes where he savagely grinds her torso just below her boob.  Perhaps she has a side-hatch we don't know about but my money is on the first thing.  Look at this film differently from now on you will, black is the force behind the Wiseau.  A bank account large enough to produce your own film to attract fresh life-forces, yes I'm on to you Tommy, and I'll be watching to see if you are secretly sucking the life-force out of the audience next time I go see this film.

For me Urban Menace is a for more worser film, a film so bad it has no redeeming qualities.Even Plan 9 From Outer Space is worse.I think a lot of people are told what to like and dislike by the media & the internet (the average Rocky Horror Picture Show is a case in point.) People watch The Room 30 times? Is that because they feel they have to to fit in with the crowd? I give this 5 stars...the endless love making scenes were terrible and I found Lisa a bore but for me every scene with Tommy Wiseau made this DVD worthwhile.He reminds me of Christopher Walken's talentless brother who can't act or direct.The end scene with him is marvelous.I would recommend this film, it made me laugh a lot but as Chuck D said : Don't believe the hype!",The Room
264,bibeaultj,"""Oh hi Mark!""",1,5 January 2015,"After reading the book ""The Disaster Artist"" by this films one and only Greg Sestero, I felt extremely compelled to write a review for this tour de force of ""so bad it's good"" cinema.The plot of the film is that a man named Johnny (played by Tommy Wiseau) has a ""future wife"" named Lisa (played by Juliette Daniel) who is having an affair with Johnny's best friend Mark (played by the previously mentioned Greg Sestero.) Also, there's this creepy kid named Denny (Phillip Haldiman)who hangs out with them and likes to watch them have sex. This kid doesn't have much relevance to the plot, in fact most scenes he is in make no sense at all, such as a drug dealer scene where he's held up before Tommy and Mark come to his rescue. This scene is never mentioned again.I have been a fan of ""The Room"" for nearly a year, and within this time I have seen it about 5 or 6 times. Every time I watch it, I notice something new. Whether it be about Tommy's acting, or about how during Tommy's freak out a picture he knocks down leans on the camera, I always find something new to laugh about. This is the film that saves me from having to find a good comedy at social events. The Room is always acceptable to watch at parties, as anyone can find it funny.The Room is one of those movies that you have to see to believe. Tommy Wiseau is one of the strangest actors ever. Not one of his pieces of dialog is pronounced correctly, not one of his lines is said in unbroken English. But he says these ridiculous lines with such confidence and passion you can't help but laugh. Some other moments are really funny too, for example a scene where Lisa's mom (played by Carolyn Minnot) admits to having breast cancer and has no reaction to it at all, and neither does her daughter. Also, it's never mentioned again.That's a common theme right there. Most scenes in the Room are just pointless and serve nothing for the central plot. Even when there's a ""tense"" argument between Johnny and Lisa, they tell each other that they love each other and not to worry about it. Plus, the flower shop scene. My god, the Flower Shop scene. I implore you to watch the Flower Shop scene and not at least chuckle. Again, something you have to see to believe. The main characters also throw a football around in tuxedos, and afterwords Tommy and Greg sit in a coffee shop and Tommy makes the most abrupt change of subject ever that is never mentioned again. All of these scenes add nothing to the plot, but what you don't want to do is watch the film for the plot. You watch it for the hilarity.You can't talk about the film without mentioning the painfully long sex scenes that are an assault on all of the senses in the human body. They have the most cheesy music and cinematography that feels like its straight out of a 1984 VHS porn tape. But in a strange way- they're extremely hilarious. Two of the things I just mentioned, the score and the cinematography, are two of the things that add to the movie. The cinematography is completely strange, switching from HD film to 35mm film at random. The score is so soaked with melodrama that you can almost feel it dripping down your neck. Again, these things only elevate the hilarity of some scenes, especially the ones that have ""dramatic"" music to Johnny doing to worst chicken impression ever conceived.Going off the technical aspects, the green screen of San Francisco during the roof top scenes is so bad it'll make you cringe. It is the worst green screen I have ever seen, but guess what? It's hilarious.""You're tearing me apart Lisa!"" Is the most quoted and one of the most hilarious scenes in the film, next to the ""I did not hit her, it's not true..."" scene. In fact, the first time I watched these scenes I had to catch my breath and wipe my eyes because I was laughing so hard. That's a valid description of the film right there.I can't find a way to properly conclude a review about one of the best worst movies ever made. It's a crazy movie-in short-but it'll change your life in ways you couldn't think imaginable. The Room gets a 1, which is to be expected, but in terms of hilarity it gets a 10. Seriously, take a break from all those Hollywood comedies and watch the Room. I'm sure you'll find it funnier than most of them anyway.

So the movie is about a drama between a man and a woman. There is pretty much no plot but it involves cheating and a lot of sexual scenes. Also there is a lot of confusion and hilarity involved between other characters. This is the kind of movie you must watch as if you are reading a book ""between the lines"".

""Plan"" had the last performance of Bela Lugosi, playing a vampire. He died before the movie was finished and he was replaced by an actor that just lurked around with his cape covering his face. Their spaceship set was a desk with a curtain behind it. I think ""The Room"" easily and honestly wins the title. (By the way Ed Wood made ""Plan"" and some of the other worst movies ever made. Tim Burton made a movie about him called, of course, ""Ed Wood"" which is great, watch that if you haven't.)You must see this movie. If you don't, your life will not be complete and you will die with a hole in your soul.I have seen a lot of movies. Most of them I forget about unless they are something very special, like ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""Star Wars"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". I will never forget those movies and what they did to me. They changed my life. This movie did the same thing. It is unforgettable. It is a masterpiece of awfulness. I will remember it until I die. There is just something special about it that lifts if from just plain bad, to something that is unbelievable. It is hypnotic. Every moment from beginning to end is like a test to see if you can withstand another second of it. If you can, you will reach a higher plane, a sort of nirvana. If you can do it you will become a different person with a greater understanding of yourself and the world around you. It is that bad. See it as soon as possible.",The Room
272,mrbeasley,The work of a genius Auteur,10,3 August 2009,"Contains SpoilersThe Location - The film is set in San Fransico, as we are reminded several times throughout the film, with good reason. San Fransico represents the city that gave birth to free love - and this is subtly juxtaposed with the theme of the film, that love is not free. Johnny's apartment has a spiral staircase indicating that the path to meaningful congress isn't straight forward, as evidenced by Lisa's liaison on the stairs. The many scenes on the roof top actually represent reaching a higher level of understanding. The transcendental if you will.The football - the football represents Lisa, a woman who is prepared to be passed from man to man, and indeed those that are not prepared for her suffer a literal downfall. It is symbolism and beautiful metaphor.The dress - this is Johnny's subconscious awareness of Lisa's true reality expressed in Jungian terms. He is bestowing on her the role of the Scarlet Woman.The rose - When Johnny places the rose on the bed next to Lisa he is saying "" I am replacing one prick in this bed with several pricks"" How true he is! The white car - this is in fact Johnny's white steed. Symbolism for him being the good guy.The repeated scene - don't believe all you read. The lovemaking scene is repeated, not for budgetary reasons or the actress' dislike of Tommy; rather it indicates that the lovemaking has become boring and literally repetitious.The Tuxedos - these symbolise Johnny's identity loss and awareness of mass consciousness.The Psychologist - forsaking the R.D Laing school of thought, he is unable to identify the existential angst of the other characters and after his symbolic downfall plays no further part in their lives.Chris R - this is in fact a scathing critique of the American Health Care system. Denny is obviously using him to get extra supplies of the Ritalin he so badly requires.The alcohol - the Scarlet Woman Lisa tempts Johnny away from the path of virtue by intoxicating him with the noxious substances of two cultures - whiskey and vodka, representing the intoxicating combination of their pairing.The names - Johnny, the 'everyman', a name used in countless films in the 40's and 50's. His everyman status is reinforced by the florists failure to recognise him until he removes that which alters his perception of the world. His sunglasses. Lisa represents 'everywoman'. Notice how the other characters have lovers called Betty and Elizabeth. Claudette - literally 'Claw Debt' - a woman obsessed by her own and others financial situation.Genetic determinism - Lisa was born out of a loveless relationship and is therefore doomed to repeat such behaviour. Her mother's breast cancer represents the transmission of this through suckling.The spoons - one is reminded of Heideggers contemplation of the representation of boots in art. The spoons are there for aesthetic rather than utility purposes. This shows that one does not always get 'one's just desserts' ( Get your coat, you're fired - Ed)",The Room
273,cynthia-ostrich,Among the Greatest 'Worst' Movies Ever,2,25 June 2013,"I can't give this movie a bunch of stars. It is just against my principles as a movie reviewer. The acting, the camera work, the sets, the sound is all truly terrible. That being said, if you are a movie enthusiast and must see all kinds and types of film, you have got to see this movie. It is so bad it accidentally becomes a masterpiece of humor. Writer/ Actor / Director Tommy Wiseau was trying to make a dramatic character piece I believe. It is an utter disaster. The best actor in the film is the 2 minute appearance of the drug dealer who merely has to play 'Angry'. It is a no star film, but a 10 star comedy; not by script, purely by the poor production.I am not one for spoilers, but there is a scene when the men all show up in tuxedos to the apartment. The story does not explain why the occasion for tuxedos, or the two strange fellows who are now on camera you have never met before. I digressThey all go outside and play catch with a football in tuxedos!!! Conveniently standing exactly three feet apart from one another. Why??? That is just a snippet of what you have to look forward to when viewing 'The Room' for the first time. However, you must watch subsequent times to truly catch all the bad acting and terrible continuity of the film; To a movie enthusiast it will really make you laugh.",The Room

276,tarheelpup,Tommy Wiseau and the American Dream,10,30 March 2016,"Where ever Tommy Wiseau grew up (a subject of some debate) he heard that America is the land of opportunity. A place where dreams can come true. And oh yes, Tommy had a dream. Tommy wanted to be an actor, a star. To one day appear on the Silver Screen in his own movie, Tommy's movie, made Tommy's way. He came to America and struggled but he never once let go of that dream. And he realized that if he pretended to be what he wanted to be, eventually he might get there. And somehow, despite everything being against him, Tommy succeeded and starred in his very own film. He brought his artistic vision into reality and put every bit of talent and ambition he had, nay his very SOUL, onto that screen. Tommy bravely never let anything get in the way of his goals. Total lack of talent, basic filmmaking ability, basic understanding of his adopted culture, the ability to speak the language of his new adopted home in a comprehensible manner? Mere obstacles to be bludgeoned out of the way in whatever way possible.Tommy Wiseau is the living, breathing embodiment of the American Dream. He set out to make a classic, and he succeeded. ""The Room"" may not be the classic Tommy INTENDED to make, but he tried. And one thing about America is undeniable, we respect those that try. And in that ""The Room"" may very well be the perfect American film. So watch ""The Room"" and shed a patriotic tear for a man and a film that ONLY America could have produced. A film as unique as the man who made it.",The Room

This is undoubtedly one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It truly is hilariously bad. Almost every scene had me and my friend rolling on the ground howling with laughter.

This is probably why the movie failed. Tommy delivers an incredibly bad an unemotional performance, the supporting cast are as well nearly just as bad, though this could simply be done to Wiseaus directing and producing.Next is the repetitive scenes over and over again, for example when we keep seeing Johnnys girlfriend (I forget her name because she was so dull) talking to her mother, this must happen about 5 times throughout the movie, and they keep talking about the same thing! Finally, the randomness sometimes of this movie is terrible, for example we have a scene in which Johnny and his friends go out and play football ALL the time... But it gets worse... There is one scene where they go and play American football in tuxedos FOR NO REASON, this is never explained.In conclusion this is a very bad experience, Tommy has tried to advertise this movie everywhere, there are even some rumours surrounding where he got the funds for the movies. Also, on some occasions it has been said when it came out Tommy said it was a Black Comedy though recently he has called it a serious drama... tut tut tut... I never liked one whole scene throughout this whole movie, it was badly directed, produced and written, one of the worst movies ever created.I urge every one not to read a lot of the 8-10 star reviews of this movie it is probably Tommy Wiseau sitting in his rented flat at 2am in the morning telling everyone about his 'amazing' creation.",The Room

And yes, it was not supposed to be a ""black comedy"" as Tommy Wiseau would like you to now believe. Actors have confirmed that this was, indeed, supposed to be a very serious film.To describe its plot would be pointless, because that is not the draw of the film. The terrible line delivery, poor green screen effects, godawful voice dubbing, bad editing, and overall dreadful writing all collide to create the perfect storm.So, please, watch this movie. I have seen it many times, and it still has me rolling on the floor.

After dozing off multiple times during its 90-minute run time, I powered through this chore with no aftertastes whatsoever. The Metacritic score pretty much sums it all up: 9 out of 100, which establishes The Room as one of the lowest scored movies ever, and I have to agree with critics this time around. Is this movie any fun? A few chuckles admittedly, primarily from the leading actor/director/writer Tommy Wiseau's monotone acting/delivery, plus that gif-worthy line ""You're tearing me apart Lisa!"" Nevertheless, these moments are too inadequate to make up for long sequences of mind-numbing dialogues and confounding interactions galore in this movie.

However it could also be the most prodigious fabrication ever to grace celluloid. Is Tommy Wisseau, the star, producer, director and egocentric narcissist behind this creation, an idiot savant trolling us all, or merely a halfwit dunce who can't distinguish the difference between creating a film, and the malodorous odour that vacates his anus? Technically-speaking, this 'film' is brimming with ignominious blemishes, from nonsensical editing to a complete absence of any sort of character development. The generic plot involving a woman cheating on her partner with another man is just yet another stain on this technically-dreadful piece of film making. Yet what draws the countless numbers of cult followers, the numerous screenings worldwide and extravagant publicity surrounding The Room? Is it the captivating and perplexing appeal of the outlandish and elusive Tommy Wisseau, whose origins lay unknown to this very day? Are the fans simply entertained by how implicitly bad the film is? The reason The Room may quite possibly be the worst best film ever created, is because every single aspect of the film, subtle or not, is characterised by the poorest of film-making standards, from the movements of the characters to the situation and setting of the scenes. Mr Wisseau could not have deliberately created a film this mind numbingly awful, as that would have been near impossible. Go see this, you won't regret it.",The Room

296,brickyardjimmy,It's like sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode,10,12 January 2004,"I have now seen Mr. Tommy Wiseau's cinematic tour-de-force, 'The Room'  three times. With each viewing, 'The Room' becomes more complexly  entangled in and inseparable from my own life. I no longer know where  The Room ends and I begin.  It is, without question, the worst film ever made. But this comment is in no way meant to be discouraging.  Because while The Room is the worst movie ever made it is also the  greatest way to spend a blisteringly fast 100 minutes in the dark.  Simply put, 'The Room' will change your life.  It's not just the dreadful acting or the sub-normal screenplay or the  bewildering direction or the musical score so soaked in melodrama that  you will throw up on yourself or the lunatic-making cinematography; no,  there is something so magically wrong with this movie that it can only  be the product of divine intervention. If you took the greatest  filmmakers in history and gave them all the task of purposefully  creating a film as spectacularly horrible as this not one of them, with  all their knowledge and skill, could make anything that could even be  considered as a contender. Not one line or scene would rival any moment  in The Room.  The centerpiece of this filmic holocaust is Mr. Tommy Wiseau himself.  Without him, it would still be the worst movie ever made, but with him  it is the greatest worst movie ever made. Tommy has been described as a  Cajun, a Croatian cyborg, possibly from Belgium, clearly a product of  Denmark, or maybe even not from this world or dimension. All of these  things are true at any one moment. He is a tantalizing mystery stuffed  inside an enigma wrapped in bacon and smothered in cheese. You will  fall in love with this man even as you are repelled by him from the  first moment he steps onto screen with his long Louis the Fourteenth  style black locks and thick triangular shoulders packed into an oddly  fitting suit, and his metallic steroid destroyed skin. Tommy looks out  of place, out of time and out of this world. There has never been  anything else like him. Nor will there ever be.  The Room begins with 'Johnny' (Tommy Wiseau) and his incomprehensibly  evil fiancée 'Lisa' (played by a woman with incongruously colored  eyebrows and a propensity for removing her shirt) engaging in some  light frottage, joined by, Denny, (played with a deft sense of the  absurd by Phillip Haldiman), their sexually confused teenage neighbor  who is clearly suffering from a form of aged decrepitude. When Denny,  who looks like the human version of Gleek the monkey from Superfriends,  says, in a slightly creepy yet playful tone of voice, 'I like to  watch!' as Johnny and Lisa roll around the bed in a pre-intercourse  ritual revolving around rose petals, you know you are in for a very  special movie.  After a lengthy lovemaking scene (not to worry if you miss it the first  time, they show it again in its entirety later in the movie) in which  Tommy's bizarre scaly torso and over-anatomized rear-end are lovingly  depicted over and over again as he appears to hump Lisa's hip, we  discover that Lisa, for no particular reason, has become bored with  Tommy's incessant lovemaking and decides to leave him.  Just when you think the movie might lapse into an ordinary, pedestrian  sort of badness, Johnny's best friend Mark, a man who's job seems to be  to wear James Brolin's beard from Amityville Horror, shows up and  electrifies the screen with a performance so wooden that it belongs in  the lumber section of Home Depot. Incidentally, Mark is played by Greg  Sestero, who, in addition to being described as a department store  mannequin, was also the line producer on 'The Room' and one of Tommy  Wiseau's five (5!!!!!) assistants on the movie. Lisa forces Mark, amid  his paltry, unconvincing protests, to have an affair with her on their  uncomfortable circular stairs. For no apparent reason Lisa decides that  she is made of pure evil and wants to torture her angelic and insanely  devoted fiancé, Johnny.  Lisa receives pointed advice from her mother who casually announces  that she is dying of breast cancer and then never mentions it again.  But Lisa is determined to make Johnny's life a living hell, in spite of  the fact that she, according to her mother, ""cannot survive on her own  in the cutthroat 'computer business'"". But not before they recycle the  sex scene from earlier in the movie where we get another bird's eye  view of Johnny's ludicrous naked body. Denny gets into trouble with a  drug dealer. Mark shaves his beard. Tommy gets drunk on an unusual  cocktail made from mixing whiskey and vodka. Lisa lies and tells  everyone that Tommy hit her in a drunken rage.  A balding psychologist appears out of nowhere, offers some advice, then  apparently dies while softly falling on the ground in an attempt to  catch a football thrown by Mark.  All of these seemingly disparate events build up to two cathartic  moments. The first is when Tommy expressively yells at Lisa with the  line 'You are tearing me apart Lisa!'. You will cheer at this line as  you realize that the film has been tearing you apart the whole time.  And the second is at Tommy's birthday party where the worst actor that  has ever been born plays a unidentified man wearing a silk shirt who  utters a phrase that perfectly describes the experience of watching The  Room,  'It feels like I'm sitting on atom bomb that is going to explode!'  The shocking ending will leave you pleading for some kind of sequel.  See this film at all costs. See it twice. Or three times. Or as one kid  that I met from Woodland Hills has, 12 times! See it until you can  recite every precious line of dialogue this movie has to offer. Let The  Room become your new religion and Tommy Wiseau your prophet preaching  the gospel according to Johnny.

This film is astonishingly bad. Despite Tommy Wisseau's assertions that this film was created as a black comedy this film was actually intended to be a tragic story of betrayal. The fact that this film is as bad as it is without trying to be bad actually make's this film one big joke.If you can enjoy a film that's so bad it's good then give this movie a watch; you won't regret it. I actually had to take breaks between the scenes because I was laughing so hard at how awful it was.Give it a watch and enjoy this jewel of a film; you'll be spouting lines from the film in no time.,The Room

It seems as though Tommy Wiseau was writing a love letter to himself when he made this movie. Within the first few minutes he has two nude scenes that are beyond creepy.The story is like an episode of the worst soap opera that you can imagine. The acting is worse than an episode of the old crime show ""Silk Stockings"" on USA Network. Juliette Danielle's crying scene on the rooftop is some of the worst acting ever captured on film.What's so funny is that it's trying to be a serious drama.",The Room

At some point you think, my god, this must be a put-on. NO ONE could have made a movie this bad on purpose! The actors appear never to have acted before the cameras started rolling. Performances are just terrible. The dialog such as it is beyond cheesy and cliché. The plot, if that's what you call it, makes no real sense. The main character Johnny (Tommy, also director/producer/auteur) looks and sounds like an alien from another planet, rejected by ""Star Trek"" as too weird.And yet, the whole thing is oddly mesmerizing, like a car wreck you can't help but stare at. Of course, half of the point of seeing it is to enjoy it with a crowd who has memorized the lines and knows how to participate in the action by now, to make fun of it.Beyond that, it's a very difficult film to describe.

This film is so bad it's become cult viewing, yet the overall plot will be familiar to most people despite it being a subject rarely covered by mainstream movies. It's like they've filmed the looping neurotic daydream thoughts of a cuckolded man, hence several lines and ideas are repeated and much of it is illogical or doesn't really fit. The script sounds like it was written by an 8 year old - an 8 year old monkey. Tommy Wiseau's acting is as though he is heavily sedated with anti-psychotic drugs, or alternatively, like an android that's failed the Turing Test. The other actors weren't quite as bad, but with their lines and Wiseau's direction it's hard to be sure if they're actual professionals or not. Terrible film with many illogical moments, but somehow still feels more real and relevant than most films. The video and audio quality is mostly ok, and the music actually wasn't too bad, plus there's a few softcore sex scenes - if you think that's a redeeming feature. 3/10.",The Room

Yet, somehow, it is easily one of my favorite films ever. It makes me laugh every time I see it. The dialogue is so incompetently written that even if the actors were any good, it would be terrible. Tommy Wiseau, the writer, director, producer, and star, has an indefinable screen presence, though no talent. The other actors are dull and mediocre. The laughs come from so many sources...the subplots that are introduced and never mentioned again, the prop inconsistencies, Tommy's terrible accent, the lines that were clearly dubbed in after the filming was done (out of sync with the lips), and the bizarre exchanges between characters. My personal favorite is when Mark tells Johnny a story about a girl he knew that would cheat, and got beat up by one of the guys so bad she ended up in a hospital, to which Johnny laughs heartily and replies, ""What a story, Mark!"" From beginning to end, this film is a train wreck you can't (and shouldn't) avert your eyes from. Enjoy!",The Room
317,generalcinema-830-500888,Quite possibly the worst thing I've ever seen,1,26 December 2017,"Ne day when I was at work, I was having a conversation with a coworker about bad movies. The ""best worst movie"" Troll 2 (known internationally as Goblins) came up. He mentioned a movie called The Room. I told him that the movie ""Best Worst Movie"" was made about Troll 2 and has the distinction of being ""the worst"". He then went on to tell me about the (then) upcoming movie The Disaster Artist, which chronicles the making of this shit storm.He told me about the movie itself and I was compelled to see it. I've read about it on IMDb and Wikipedia and it sounded awful. I made it my mission to see this.
I finally procured a copy and I'm now indulging in it as I write this. Where can I possibly begin?There's a sex scene just after the four-minute mark. Everything else is almost laugh-out-loud bad. The acting, the music, the grunting and moaning. Everything.
It's difficult to write this because the writing in this is beyond anything I've ever experienced. Calling it atrocious would be kind. To top it off, the camera goes out of focus periodically. Apparently, nobody bothered to check the lens, so this is a thing.My God. Seventeen minutes in and so far there's been nothing but some minor dialogue and two sex scenes. Both scenes have horrible music and at the second one, the actors voices are dubbed over the music. You hear HIM say ""Oh Lisa"", but they're KISSING. This is like a bad porn movie from the early eighties (not the sex, the music).I have over an hour left of this appalling film. Check this out...I LITERALLY have to use a thesaurus because of how mind-boggling terrible this is.
I'm pausing it at times to get my thoughts straight. Back to the bad sex scene.
The lines are forced and the ""acting"" is wooden.Wow. Fuck me.I appreciate Tommy Wiseau wanting to write, direct, produce, and star in his own movie. Independent filmmakers are among the people that I look up to the most. The greatest of them all is Roger Corman. He is (as far as I'm concerned) the Patron Saint of independent filmmakers. He's produced over 400 films, directed over 50, and turned a profit on almost every one (give or take a dozen or so).
Tommy Wiseau is the modern day Ed Wood. That's actually an insult to Mister Wood because at least he had vision. If he had the budget that he needed, his films would have been science fiction masterpieces and not the schlockfests that they are.Robert Rodriguez (like Tommy Wiseau) financed his first film independently. That was a little film called El Mariachi. That got so popular that it spawned two sequels (Desperado and Once Upon A Time In Mexico). Robert Rodriguez is FUCKING AMAZING. I may not be a fan of everything he does, but HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING!!!!!Fuck! Only twenty minutes in.Okay, who in their right mind orders a pizza with ""half Canadian bacon and pineapple and half with artichoke and pesto, light on the cheese""? Do these people even know what pizza is? An argument can be made for the bacon/pineapple, but who puts pesto on pizza? Maybe it's a thing and I'm being too critical.Apparently, much of the audio was dubbed which leads to the audio being out of sync.What the hell is this movie about? So far, it's been her having sex with two different guys, some pizza, and some horrific dialogue.Sadly, for me, the BEST part of this Godawful movie is Juliette Danielle. She's very pretty and I like her topless scene. Too bad the THREE sex scenes in the first HALF HOUR were unnecessary
.
Being objective about the plot (from what I could gather), Lisa and Tommy are dating. He's her financial security and in line for a promotion. She no longer loves him and one day she gets him drunk and complains to her mother that he got drunk (he did) and that he hit her (he didn't). There's also this annoying kid named Denny who shows up at unnecessary times.It looks like it's supposed to be about relationships, but there's NOTHING cohesive about this movie. There's a scene where Denny runs afoul of a drug dealer and the interaction with everyone is reprehensible. Lisa and her mom suddenly show up off camera and Johnny takes the drug dealer to the police, but the time it would take to actually do that isn't represented properly. He comes back about a minute later.The CLOSEST thing I can get to a plot is as follows: Johnny and Lisa are lovers. He comes home and they have sex. Johnny's ward Denny wants to hang out with them, but they send him away so they can have sex. After he leaves for the day, she calls his best friend Mark and seduces him and they sleep together. After he comes home, they drink and have pizza, and then have sex again.Lisa complains to her mother that she no longer loves Johnny and gets yelled at because she can't support herself. On a rooftop, Denny gets into an altercation with a drug dealer that gets interrupted by Johnny and Mark. Later on that rooftop, Denny confesses his love for Lisa to Johnny. Johnny says that he trusts her, meanwhile Lisa brags to her friend about how she's sleeping with Mark.
The way people show up in this is like a bad sitcom. In fact, a laugh track would probably make this better.Earlier, I said that Tommy Wiseau was in league with Ed Wood. I was incorrect. The directors that are in the same category as him are: Paul W. S. Anderson, Vincent Gallo, and the infamous Uwe Boll.Not everyone should make movies and this is proof. It's further proof that if you don't know what you're doing, you should ask for help. There's no shame in that. Pride is a bad servant and a worse master.I feel that this review is a bit irreverent, but that's appropriate given the fact that this movie falls about fifty yards short of making any kind of sense.Currently, I have about a half hour left and this movie has gone nowhere. There isn't a single character that I care about. The plot tries to make it out of the jumbled mess that is this movie. Sadly, there's only been four terrible sex scenes that are forced upon us. Only two are necessary for the plot to move forward and while I appreciate nudity, it's unnecessary in this. This would have been better as a made-for-TV movie on Lifetime.The most ironic thing about this film is that there's no aforementioned ""Room"". According to Tommy Wiseau, the title is meant to evoke a safe place for viewers. Realistically, the BEST place for viewers is far away from this monstrous creation.I'm giving this 1 out of 5 reasons why you shouldn't let your curiosity get the best of you.",The Room

319,chimaru98,Definitely an unforgettable experience,8,27 June 2014,"Having seen this film a few weeks ago with some of my friends I can say with complete and utter certainty that this is one of, if not THE most revolutionary film of our age. I had heard stories before of this film, but I had to see it myself to be sure. Watching it, I realised it was true. Never before had I seen such a film with so many extraordinary one-liners that my friends and I can still remember with accuracy to this day. The plot was definitely intriguing, and one that I struggled to figure out right until the very end.Moving onto the plot, which is complex yet enjoyable, it involves the struggles of Johnny, the lovable rogue who attempts to enchant his would-be lover Lisa with his charm and wit. However, this fails, as Lisa falls for a young man by the name of Mark, who has troubles overcoming his drug addiction which constantly pains him. Meanwhile, a young boy by the name of Denny tries to cope with the city environment in which he lives, eventually getting into trouble with a drug dealer. Johnny saves him, however, and the two appear to become the best of friends. Eventually, Lisa hints to Johnny that she is in love with Mark, and does not love Johnny any more, but our protagonist fails to take the hint, and everything slowly disintegrates from there on out in the film. Once even consulting the psychiatrist fails, everyone slowly seems to descend into madness struggling to cope with the pressure of everyday life. Eventually, Johnny shoots himself due to the stress and anguish he faces, and is mourned by Denny.The film's greatness is ensured by the amount of skill Tommy Wiseau has as an actor, portraying Johnny. His delivery of one particular line where he shouts in despair at Lisa, who is apparently ""tearing him apart"", can be considered (and is considered by many) one of the greatest moments in film in recent years. All in all, I am giving this film a 3. You may be wondering why, due to the apparent positivity in this review, and the fact that I gave it an 8. It happens that all of the positivity was non-existent, you were just interpreting it incorrectly.As a film, The Room is honestly terrible, but as a way to waste an hour and forty minutes, it's one of the best I can imagine.-chimaru98",The Room

321,SongbirdCtTheKitty,"A Confusing, Dark, and Wonderful Mess.",3,27 September 2014,"After watching many reviews on this movie and hearing so many people recommend it, I decided to check it out. And overall, it's not the worst thing I saw (I've viewed Ratatoing, and Foodfight!) but it's still pretty wretched. I will admit that the movie is kind of compelling in a way. I use that term lightly. It's pretty interestingly set up. Johnny has a fiancée named Lisa, and they are getting married next month. Johnny is satisfied with his life, but Lisa is not. She decides that she doesn't love Johnny anymore, and has an affair with his best friend Mark. And that's basically the whole plot. And being fair, it was pretty intriguing. I was interested to see where it was going to lead. But apparently the writer/ producer/main character of the movie Tommy Wiseau got confused and threw different stories at us during the movie. And that brings me to my gripes about this movie. Here's a list: 1. Misunderstood character development 2. Scenes that try to add character development, and not only fail, but feel pointless during the movie. (Ex. Denny taking drugs, Claudette's breast cancer, etc.) 3. Repetitive scenes (We see Lisa talking to her mother numerous times, Lisa and Mark having sex, Mark, Jonny and Denny throwing a football around randomly, shots of San Francisco with the same music..... Must I go on?) 4. Tommy Wiseau cannot act. I'll just leave it at that. 5. Why are Johnny, Peter, Denny, and Mark playing football in their TUXEDOS?? 6. TOO MANY LONG SEX SCENES! I honestly think that Tommy Wiseau was trying to do a porn film. So with that being said, my favorite part was the ending. SPOILERS!!!! Lisa's affair is finally unearthed by Johnny, she leaves, then Johnny goes completely insane. Tearing the place apart and killing himself. It was the most intense and dramatic thing I saw, and I actually felt sorry for him afterwards. To wrap it up, I do recommend that you watch this movie at least once. It's bad, but it IS entertaining. RATING: 3/10",The Room
322,spacian379,"It's worth it, trust me",10,5 July 2014,"I consider myself a bit of a bad movie enthusiast, so I'd like to indulge the masses with my take on this popular cult movie. You have likely heard that this film is the worst ever made, it's so bad it's good, or some over dramatized rant about how awful it is to sit through. I'm going to tell you right now the God's honest truth about this movie: It sucks.But it's a very complicated kind of suck, the kind only a vacuum could speak of. It is horribly inept in technical execution, it's dialogue sounds like it came out of a melting calculator , and the actors, Wiseau in particular, act with the grace of card board cut outs of actors in a middle school production of ""Macbeth"". Its score is horrendous to listen to and the cinematography is hardly enviable.And despite all of it, I love this movie. Wiseau is in many ways like a young child trying to impress his parents, trying to do everything a good movie entails but failing miserably at it every step of the way. It's like watching a forest fire. It's just hard not to be enticed by the flames of this disaster, to keep your eyes fixed as you watch the hapless Johnny drift from scene to scene with his array of accents and obscure lines. It's not that it's so bad it's good, it's just so bad you reach the bliss of realizing that you are bearing witness to something truly spectacular, the worst honest attempt at cinema ever concocted. Lucifer himself could not create a movie so terrible, let alone as funny. Its charm, much like that of the aforementioned child is simply too much to ignore, you can't help but feel sympathy for Wiseau and his effort to become a star of cinema.This is not a movie one should watch alone. Have a few friends with a good sense of humor join you as I did, and have fun tearing apart every little detail in this train wreck. By the end of the two hours your gut will be sore from laughter, your head awash with jokes, and pretty soon you'll start every greeting with ""Oh hi Mark!""

The story is nothing more than an excuse to go out and kill stuff, and the cinematic quality is just as unforgiving as humanity's struggle for survival in a world where other races and species are vying for dominance.

If you truly have some morbid desire to see THE worst movie ever made (as I foolishly did), then this is your best bet, but I highly advise against it. If you do proceed, I recommend large amounts of alcohol and/or drugs. It is BARELY ""so bad it's good""... barely ""good"" in the sense that it is barely unintentionally funny. It beats ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", easily de-throning that movie from its former reign as The Worst Movie Ever Made.Words simply cannot effectively describe this movie, and it's not worth any type of time or effort to attempt to seriously analyze it from a critical point of view. The movie is hopeless and utterly pointless, literally every aspect of it is terrible. Only ridiculous hyperbole is appropriate:Just imagine the best movie you've ever seen, now imagine the complete opposite, the total inverse of that movie in every aspect, to hopefully visualize something even worse than the worst movie you've ever seen. Now imagine the worst movie you actually have seen. Pretend they mated, the fictional inverse movie and the actual horrible movie, and that their offspring was a premature abortion which only inherited the absolute worst negative qualities from its parents.

I say majority because the only flaw that this movie has is it's length. It's too long, waaaaaay to long. The last 30 to 40 minutes are a drag to sit trough and you just want it to end.

I am, however, looking forward to watching ""The Disaster Artist,"" if only to enjoy how it's possible to make a good movie about making a bad one.",The Room

Now the star of this s*** storm is none other then the one! The only! Tommy Wiseau!! Who clearly did not have a f**king clue what he was doing! The story is absolutely jank! ( jank is a English term for dog s**t basically). People just don't act like that I don't care what planet your from Tommy. The characters? I couldn't tell you honestly!. Oh god and the acting! If you can call it acting, f**k me!. Tommy is the king of bad acting his so bad at it his actually good, I mean it, in some f**ked up way I enjoy watching how bad his acting is just to see if he can get any worse and as always, Tommy won't let you down.Now do yourself a favour, if your not into wasting your time with bad movies then don't watch this, but if your anything like me and can enjoy and laugh at a terrible movie then by all means go and watch this, because this is by far the best of the best when it comes to bad movies, you won't stop laughing.Although I can take some enjoyment out of this film I'm still only going to give it a 1/10 as it still is a bad movie and anything higher would insult the greater movies out there.1/10",The Room

This black comedy includes the best cinematography of San Francisco since Hitchcock's Vertigo. Wiseau, a new and mysterious presence on the Hollywood film making scene, produced and stars as the lead in this roller coaster ride of emotions which run the gamut from hysterical laughter to gut wrenching guilt. Wiseau spoof's the Hollywood love story. It's a campy version of a Tennessee Williams film with a little John Waters thrown in. He wants everyone to see themselves. The lead actress is every guy's nightmare with a sexual taste for your best friend. This is a story about a nymphomaniac with great breasts and the victim who is clueless about her scattered sexual outlook about men. Worth seeing. It's now 2011, eight years later and I would never have believed that this problematic film would have become a cult classic,""worst movie ever made"" with 12 midnight monthly showings around the U.S., all these years.

Lisa begins to bed Johnny's best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero). That's all really.This film defines bad filmakeing, a bad script, bad actors, bad acting, everything. This one isn't exactly on par with Battlefield: Earth, this one is at least enjoyable. It is funny through it's stupidity. When this was first seen, most likely by the critics, laughed at it. Out of embarrassment, Tommy Wiseau claimed it was a Black Comedy. It was marketed as a Black Comedy. That's kind of like making ""Inception"", and then releasing it as a chick flick. Acting was very paralyzed, Every time there was more than two people in the room, one of them would say ""I have to get going"". Everyone is always coming in and out of Johnny's apartment, Lisa's mother makes a comment about how ""it's like Grand Central Station"". People are constantly looking directly at the camera, Kyle Vogt, one of Johnny's friends, does this excessively.

Everything is in this bizarre uncanny valley of being close to correct, but not at all.The best way I can explain this movie is that it's the difference between someone saying ""I've got a fire in my belly"" (meaning that they're motivated) versus saying ""My stomach is on fire.""I gave this film a two star rating because of things I would consider more objective. It's poorly made overall, but there are some shots and choices that are actually very smart and done well, even if I suspect they are accidental. That being said, I've seen this movie more than some movies I'd give a nine or ten to and not once regretted it.I love this movie. Despite the two star rating, it is one of my all time favorite movies to watch. Every time I see it, there's something new that pops out at me that I didn't notice before. Of course, it started out as an ironic love, but it's developed from that into an unironic adoration and appreciation of this movie that I don't have for many other movies of this kind.Tommy Wiseau has since come out and said he made the movie as a comedy. I don't believe him, but if it turns out that it was, then he is an Andy Kaufman level of genius and dedication to character.I can't stress enough that I have never, ever been bored or disappointed by this movie.

Sure, we had Ed Wood (1994), an Oscar Winning film about the king of bad film-making, but that is about it.
Tommy Wiseau will always be one of the most interesting men in entertainment history. His backstory is sketchy and no one really knows anything about him. I wonder if he meant to make a film so horrible or was it an accident. It's been said that he called it a drama until the internet collectively dismissed it a serious movie.
Wiseau cast himself as Johnny, a banker from San Francisco, who is in love with girlfriend Lisa (Juliette Danielle). Lisa is bored of the relationship and has an affair with Johnny's friend Mark (Greg Sestero). Johnny for the longest is oblivious as to what is going on around him and he desperately wants to keep Lisa in his life and marry her. There is also a young man named Denny who follows Johnny and Lisa around and has a drug habit that the others aren't aware of until almost the end of the film.
The story sounds like a basic romantic drama, sure, but it is filled with painfully odd and unintentionally funny scenes. There are extremely long sex scenes where we get to see a little more than we need to see if Wiseau. This film is the very definition of absurd and many people love it for that reason, but honestly when I sat down to watch the whole film I was kind of bored.

I love how everyone in this movie took there script seriously, I don't see how you could, it was written by Tommy Wiseau who clearly wasn't in a right state of mind to be writing anything.

373,erixart-733-29016,This one's for the ladies...,3,1 January 2011,"I simply couldn't keep my comments in my pocket any longer. ""The Room"" is an expertly crafted ""black"" comedy by an idiosyncratic filmmaker, but it's also much more than that.Producer/writer/director/star Tommy Wiseau somehow managed to achieve the impossible with ""The Room"". Besides delivering a knee-slapping chucklefest for discriminating purveyors of alternative-style humor like myself (and my future wife, who watched it with me), this cinematic gem is also a thinly veiled love letter from Mr. Wiseau to all the ladies of the world. This is most evident by all the time ""Johnny"" dedicates to keeping ""Lisa"" satisfied in ""The Room"". The prowess he displays in the bedroom is staggering. My future wife played it off, but she noticed. I mean, how could I blame her? Just take that trademark slow-but-steady thrust Johnny delivers to Lisa's abdominal region on numerous occasions. Or how his arm stays flexed when he's spooning with her, even when he's sound asleep. Johnny hasn't even gotten started before he sets pulses racing by giving female viewers an ample opportunity to steal a glimpse of his beautiful buttocks.I had to change me underwears four times the night we viewed this film, so it's alright by me that a guy who made me laugh THAT much captured my future wife's imagination while I was away washing up. But keep in mind...I just like to watch.",The Room

The moment I saw Tommy Wiseau I immediately cheered as I knew this was going to be a good movie that was worthy of my time. The Rooms stellar dialog kept me at the edge of my seat as I constantly wanted to see what was going to happen next, also all of the actors were so brilliant that I literally felt I was part of the film. I felt angry when Tommy Wiseau was mad and I cried when he was depressed. This masterful piece of artwork was definitely throughly thought out, especially the biography on Steve. Then when this Epic piece ended I stood up and cheered knowing that I just watched a good movie and a single tear appeared from my eye and rolled down from my cheek as I was in awe.

The characters are endearing are you get caught up in their affection for one another and their togetherness. It is something that many men can identify  with from their past or have to look forward to in their future. Some men will keep this as their secret. It clearly shows the timeless triangle of the friendship between two men brought down and completely destroyed by a beautiful, remorseless and deceitful woman using sex and co-dependency as her lethal weapons.The character, Johnny, is so endearing in his complete  trust of his finance,the beautiful Lisa. Johnny is a very sweet and trusting man .The director really missed many  heart stopping moments  that were lost, because of rushing through the scenes that were very loaded with tension and should have been played out to the max. There should have been longer heart stopping pauses, but instead the moment was lost by rushing through the scenes that were exploding with  sexual tension. There were several of these such instances at Johnny's surprise birthday party when everyone was all around having a good time laughing and not knowing how volatile the situation in the room was. The movie really missed it by not exploiting this to the fullest. This was what the whole movie had been building up to. There was so much sexual tension between the unfaithful Lisa and Johnnie's cheating friend, Mark. The air was riveting and charged with the buildup from the start of  the whole movie. The directors should have really made a big deal of long, tension filled, up close eye contact, between Lisa and Mark. Mark was definitely not thinking with his brain. These looks and tensions could have been played out  and underscored so much more.I was disappointed this huge opportunity was barely tapped. This was my biggest disappointment about the entire movie. There should have been more exchange tension filled looks between Lisa and Mark, Mark and Johnnie, and others that knew, but mostly between Lisa and Mark, and the camera should have let time stand still with a close up of the emotion in Lisa and Mark's eyes. Everyone would squirm as the whole party of friends stood in the circle awaiting..... the bomb to explode.....how..... and with whom????? Let the tension exist and prolong it so we all get our money's worth for the.... climax.Lisa was completely  spontaneous, unpredictable and with no inhibitions to get what she wanted..... wherever she wanted it. Even Lisa's mother could not believe how remorseless her daughter was.This movie gets better each time you see it.  All the characters are so endearing you feel like you are actually there with them and they are your friends. Each character is special. There are heart stopping moments of suspense when you think Johnny will find out about his best friend, and will freak out, he is so in love with her. Johnny's best friend, Mark, is a sexy hunk who would make any woman melt. The impetuous, Lisa, is the woman every woman fears and every man secretly longs to be seduced by. Johnny is the man every woman wishes they had to  completely trust and adore them. Lisa starts to make everyone feel uncomfortable and uneasy  because she has no impulse control. She is out to lure and seduce every man that comes close to her. Some of the scenes showed Lisa, with her huge violet eyes and dark eyebrows, as being very innocent and sweet,  and you actually feel sorry for her. The only person that really seem to be able to touch Lisa, was the young boy that Johnny had adopted. Only with him, did she seem to think about someone besides herself.Look for Mark and Lisa to be Hollywood's next sweethearts. They look just sensational on the big screen together. I don't know where Tommy found a couple that looks so much alike. When they are on the big screen together, they are beautiful.The only problem is Lisa is evil, and Mark is good. But Mark like the other men, is unable to resist Lisa.  The music goes perfectly with the movie. Get the soundtrack. This movie deals with something that is between us and all around us everyday and always will be. This movie was filmed in San Francisco. Something about the movie haunts you  and you end up hungering for more. The movie was very lighthearted, different and entertaining because it took your mind  inside other's lives and their unique friendships. A film we can all relate to.... and fear or.. anticipate.... depending on if you are male or female....and which role you are playing!      Thank you, Tommy-",The Room

Some guy had written to Tommy Wiseau that the audience was laughing at him not with him. Well obviously that writer was not one that liked the movie...so why was he there??? I and others on each side of me who were so enjoying this movie and found it delightful. That critic who described other people laughing at Tommy Wiseau, described themselves right in that sentence. What do we say in America of those who ""laugh at somebody""....case in point, enough said...but just shame on you.Those that laugh AT others show their own character and how ""small"" they are. There are many little kids who experience this same meanness as a small child. It shows how inmature and what a low self concept this person has of self.There was something about this movie that appeals to a great many people. Many of the movies I see now days are so the same old movie type, with the same faces....very boring and trite. It is really fun and refreshing to find something out there that is delightfully different with some different actors. Each of these actors were very different and really had their own personalities.This movie was alive with energy and fun spirit. There was something about ""THE ROOM"" that made you feel as if these actors were really your own friends and you felt part of the movie. Some critic had pointed out that some of the movie had been filmed to show this movie took place in San Francisco. So what is new....? That makes it interesting. And to the makers of this movie I say to you....ignore the critics..they are there because otherwise no one would notice them and it is obvious that some of these guy for some reason appears to be very jealous or for some reason is trying to make fun of Tommy Wiseau. Shame on them....it just shows a persons character.The movie was very colorful in the color displayed throughout the film and the characters were colorful in their personalities. The acting was great and alive with new energy. I am not in the movie business....I am just a movie goer that was delighted to find something different from the usual trite movies fed to us by the same group of Hollywood, that wants everyone to think and see things only one way...their way. This movie was funny, entertaining, kept your attention and you loved all the characters... I can understand the cult following completely. Remember Mr.Wiseau, the people who are making the negative comments are the ones in the business who don't like you personally for whatever reason. People like me, are the ones who are not in the business, but actually go to the movie for fun and pure enjoyment. And we.........lots of us loved the movie and would like to see more.

To say the least I was both shocked and laughing hard as the review progressed. After a while you start to realize that this film is more of a guilty pleasure than being down right horrible. Yes the acting is horrific and the storyline is quite cliché. On the other hand you have to give Tommy Wiseau SOME credit for trying to make a dollar. If there's anything I've learned from this movie it would be these:1) Have an affair with your future husband in public 2) Throw around a football with tuxes on 3) Take shockingly bad news rather decently 4) Make cat noises when fighting with your best friend, AND! 5) Always ask if someone is dead when they obviously are.Overall there's not much else to say, like the NC said it's really worth checking out granted we don't get yelled at by those copyright nazi's over at Wiseau Films.

382,JTworker,Tommy Wiseau AKA Frankenstein's Monster,6,21 December 2017,"Things I love about this movie:
-Tommy Wiseau resembles an uglier more disfigured version of Frankenstein's Monster
-All the sets are made out of popsicle sticks
-Every actor is a washed up former porn actor...Including the 75 year old grandma
-The 5 lead male characters are unable to throw a football more than two feet
-The 12 year old boy from The Brady Bunch is a hardcore heroin dealer
-Everyone at all times ""has to go"" in the middle of important conversation or just seconds after they entered scene.
-The ""seductress"" who is ""so beautiful"" is actually a hippopotamus with fake tits in a blonde wig 
-The grandma is the biggest gold digger in the game (BEWARE!)
-Somehow an absolute imbecile numbskull rètárdé like Johnny went from being a hotel bus boy to a high powered extremely wealthy banker in the matter of 5 years
-All the horrendous clothes Johnny wears are 8 sizes too big, wrinkled, and ill fittingIt's hard to take the film seriously when the main character is a disfigured Frankenstein with lopsided shoulders, a melted-wax-sculpture face, and speaks like a molasses monster. How can this man go the entire movie without moving one muscle in his face besides his mouth. On top of his physical attributes, Johnny may be the worst dressed human being in the universe. The film is as if an alien read ""American Culture for Dummies,"" wrote a script overnight, translated the script from Native Alien Language to English, and then neglected to have anyone look over and proofread the script. Every line in the film is a mixture of a cliche and nonsense. ""I would like a large pizza half canadian bacon, half pineapple pesto, light on the cheese"" WTF kind of pizza is that. ""Honey would you like pizza?"" ""Ehh not really, whatever"" ""Great, cus I ordered Pizza :)"" WhyTF you smiling when he said he didn't care for the pizza???.... *Pizza mysteriously shows up on table within 1 minute and its a SMALL CHEESE ONLY PIZZA no toppings in sight.How to write this script:
1. Buy a book full of cliches
2. Cut out every cliche in the book and put all the pieces of paper in a hat
3. Blindly pick the cliches out of the hat one by one, and put them all in a row
4. Go through every cliche and switch 2 random words in that cliche to words that don't make sense
5. Congratulations you just wrote The RoomBTW WhyTF is this move called ""the room"" that has absolutely NO significance AT ALL. My guess is that the entire film was shot in one room that's how bad the sets are...",The Room

The film will take you on an emotional roller-coaster that you'll be strapped in for till the end. You really begin to feel for Johnny as Lisa betrays him for his best friend Mark. The dialogue is just so moving. When Johnny tells the viewers that Lisa is tearing him apart you can't help but feel torn up inside. The poor man had everything with Lisa, without her, he has nothing. It also has its way about dealing with drugs and other problems such as cancer. The ending will leave you crying and wanting more.

There's also Johnny's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike The Room ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Johnny's existential catchphrase ""I did not hit her! It's not true! It's bullshit, I did not hit her! I did not!... Oh, hai Mark!"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Tommy Wiseau's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.

My friend and I had a good laugh watching this, we cringed so much that it became hilarious. The horrific acting and simply ewful plot became somewhat of an inside joke that we still occasionally bring up today.

It's the 10 car pile-up on the freeway that you can't help but stare at, and it's more addictive than Spice Melange. Anybody who wishes to make a movie should watch it thoroughly, so that they can know what to avoid...forever.There is 1 redeeming quality to this movie and that is the quality of the camera work. Let's face it, most independent films possess qualities just slightly better than a VHS set-up, and the cinematography of the Room is top notch. The camera work is smooth, and the audio pick-up is crisp and clean. There are bigger budget movies (Cough * TRANSFORMERS * Cough) that could learn a lesson or 2 about making certain that people can see what's happening on-screen (like any movie that has useless Shaky-Cam).The story is atrocious. The protagonist is creepy (the woman who played his fiancée looked to be about 20 years old as well as being 20 years younger than him, and the were supposed to have been dating for 7 years or so). The soundtrack is cheesy. There are about 4 gratuitous sex scenes in the first 30 minutes, so that it feels like you should be watching this in an adult theater* (while angrily demanding a refund of your money). And to top it off, there's a man-child who likes to play football, all the time, especially when he's in a tux.In short, it's better than Citizen Kane.*Are those places even still around?

I've seen so many bad movies (The Stuff, Birdemic 1 & 2) that makes me want to pull my own hair out but there's something about this movie that makes you learn things, especially about filmmaking. It teaches you the values of what to avoid and how NOT to go down Wiseau's route. The cinematography and lighting is pretty good but unfortunately my greatest criticism is Wiseau's input on the overall film i.e. directing, writing and even starring as the legendary Johnny. There are so many things about 'The Room' that simply doesn't make sense (lines of dialogue and even the plot). Mark's bizarre decisions in life, Lisa's motive to ruin people's lives and even choices of what to actually say like ""Did you get the promotion"" ""Nah"" ""You didn't get it did you?"".The summarise it up.

408,ananimeprofilepicture,The sheer genius of this film escapes what the limited scope of human language is able to express,10,4 August 2019,"This movie is my religion. I firmly believe that this is what you see before you die. Tommy Wiseau's expert acting and riveting storytelling demonstrate His complete mastery and understanding of movies as an art form. The characters are likeable and you find a different part of your persona identifying with each new character you encounter, giving the Room an introspective undertone. As every character changes and develops throughout the course of the story, so to does your consciousness evolve as its warring factions are reconciled into a rapture of blissful harmony and understanding. This film has helped me in ways I have only just begun to understand, and it is a sure must-view. Mere moments after this majestic work had concluded, I felt my ignorant, close-minded sense of self fading into the void, and my soul filled with visions of His masterpiece. I am one, not just with this universe, but with all others. Earthly trappings matter not to me now, as I care only to spread His word and to forever carry out His will in whatever way this sniveling mortal form that my higher self clings to can manage. This movie as an integral part of the human experience, as it will be what ends the human experience. We must shed the limits of self and flesh if we are truly to fully understand His teachings, for now we are weak and blind, unable to comprehend the meanings of His messages. Only the soul, untrained though it is, has the potential to understand the utter beauty of the Room. I hope you will join me in shedding the weaknesses of being and ascend into a higher plane of existence, so we may one day call Him from beyond the curtain. When that blessed day arrives, and the sounds of His divine vocal cords send the words ""oh hi Mark"" echoing across the cosmos, then we will truly know the meaning of existence.",The Room

411,RyanDangerously,A great experience with an awful film,10,18 November 2011,"This is seriously the worst movie of all time; there really is no contest here. The acting, the use of shots, the music and the overall premise is unbelievably bad. A love triangle between a banker, a hunk and a blonde woman is the plot of this film which has been likened to a play by the director, Tommy Wiseau. Unfortunately this same guy is the producer and writer. Oh, and he stars in it too.Do not go into this movie expecting the best romance ever made or even a decent romance for that matter. No matter how much potential each actor/actress holds, they all share the same emotionless line reading status. The main star of this film (and I guess rightly so because of how awesome he looks) is Tommy Wiseau who plays Johnny, a banker and lover. It is fair to say without insulting anyone that his accent alone makes the movie. His pronunciation of words and sentences has become standout moments in their own sense. Accompanying him and the other range of characters is a green screen backdrop overlooking a very bland looking city. Despite being called 'The Room', the apartment and the roof play big parts in this movie themselves.One of the worst things about this movie is the music throughout it. Despite the movie being a romantic drama, the dramatic piano theme that would be much better suited to a TV movie about hobbits, keeps coming back to annoy us viewers throughout various points in the movie. In the opening it works quite well and sets the scene but then it gets boring very quickly and it is ridiculously overused. If I see this next time then I will be tempted to start a drinking game involving the times this theme appears in the movie! The music is so laughably bad in parts of the movie (and by parts I mean the whole thing) that this makes the movie more laughable than it already is. For example, music suddenly plays when one of the characters, Greg, enters the room and then suddenly stops. This is only one of the many instances when dramatic music is used out of nowhere for no apparently reason! When it's not cheap instrumental music, it's instead cheesy lyrical love songs that play during the clichéd sex scenes.Another funny thing in this movie is the tendency to bring up random story lines and then get rid of them soon after. There is a breast cancer line spoken by the mother which is never referred to again in the rest of the movie. We are aware that it is a movie about love and not cancer, but if there's not going to be a resolution then don't bring it up to begin with. Another storyline that had a lot of potential to interest us viewers above the main storyline was Denny's drug money problems. A random thug appears on the infamous rooftop where he threatens Denny with a gun however after a commotion this is never talked about again. And what's with the couple who feel the need to make love in Johnny's apartment before Lisa and her mother arrive?This brings us to another problem in the movie. Many unimportant elements such as the random couple are focused on too much in this movie. The movie focuses on the couple's attempt at love-making for a few minutes which made me think that perhaps these are two other important characters in what could be a separate plot. But nope. They are just simply secondary characters who are never really focused on again; meaning the need to show them at all is simply pointless. In a café scene, we are forced to sit through the orders of four random customers before Johnny comes into the scene! What is the point? Add to this the countless establishing shots in between more important scenes and it's fair to say this movie focuses too much on what shouldn't be focused on.This review could go on forever because there is a lot to say about this movie. And none of it is positive. However negative this review may seem though, this movie has actually given me one of the most joyful movie-going experiences in my life. I would pay over and over again just to see this movie. It is full of unintentional laughs because of its bad direction, terrible acting thanks to our star Tommy Wiseau and the unforgettable music. And for that, I want to thank Tommy for giving us a perfect example of not only everything a movie should never be; a good lesson to filmmakers and audiences alike, but also for giving us one of the best unintentional comedies of all time. I recommend this movie for a good time, and a good time only. Definitely a movie worth paying for if it is playing in your city.",The Room

It's Time to add another name to the list of timeless classic cinematic pairs: Wiseau and Sestero. Wiseau and Sestero are as juicy a pairing as any on that list. Wiseau has the screen presence and charisma of a young Brando, and is perfectly matched by a subtle, carefully nuanced performance from Sestero.Although the strong, screen-commanding performances may be the main draw here, you simply cannot forget about the high quality of the writing, something that is so rare these days. This film features some of the sharpest, most elegant dialogue ever put on celluloid. Speaking any given line from this masterpiece is like having jewels in your mouth.The film also features several red-hot love scenes, so natural and sensual that you may find yourself swooning. Juliette Danielle and Tommy Wiseau burn a hole in the screen. In short, The Room will restore your faith in movies.

At first I was scared when I was told it was a movie about a man who could barely speak English and was struggling to keep his girlfriend, but there was so much more. There were roses....spoons....and Denny. Tommy Wiseau, possibly the greatest independent,new,director/writer/producer named Tommy to come from Europe in the past year...bar none. Some people have compared him to Tennesse Williams, and I couldn't agree more...his acting is probably the closest I've seen to him since Philip Haldiman. The symbolic usage of spoons in this movie makes me love it even more. The cutaways to the fabulous bridge brings a horrifying yet satisfying theme to this already quirky yet serious yet pornographic movie. I cannot wait to see what movie Tommy decides to do next, personally I don't think he can top this one....but maybe a sequel is in order to this great trilogy or saga of movies to ""The Room""...possibly Denny spin-offs.

417,duffy231185,Room for admiration,2,18 August 2016,"Having achieved infamy as being one of, if not the, worst film of all time it was about time I settled down to watch this and see for myself.The answer? It most certainly is up there.The dialogue is perhaps the most ridiculous, nonsensical ever committed to film. In some places it just doesn't even match with what is happening on screen leaving you completely bewildered but in a state of amusement for sure. The infamous ""I did not"" scene will have you both roaring with laughter and shaking your head at the ludicrous nature of it all.This film is full of bizarre & random scenes such as playing football (American) in a tuxedo, excruciating long and unrealistic sex scenes, absurd conversations with friends, nonchalantly discussing illness and that hideous out of place laugh that made me fell nervous and uncomfortable every time it sounded.The acting is in the premiership of dreadfulness. I cannot believe that these people were paid for doing such an awful job – there is certainly hope for us all yet. Nothing is said with any passion or commitment to the project. Everything is said matter-of-factly straight from the script pages.So is this film ""so bad it's good"" or ""so bad it's hated""? Truth be told it's neither and is that rarity of just being plain bad. It is however definitely worth seeing to delight in its absurdity.I'm not an expert in film or cinematic techniques (as you can undoubtedly tell from this review) but just a guy who watches a lot of films. Whilst it is true that this is an awful film in its acting, writing, production and direction, it is incredibly difficult to be too harsh for one reason; Tommy Wiseau. Here we have a man, who despite not being the most talented has achieved something most of us never will – by making this film he has followed his dream and there is something heart achingly beautiful in that most illusive of human endeavours.",The Room
418,AndreasArslan,"Once in a lifetime experience - A try at a metaphorical expression of ""The room""s transcendental properties",10,18 April 2012,"I really, honestly, from the bottom of my heart feel, that this movie should get a ten star rating. Not on the grounds you would usually praise an, what is called ""artistically achieved movie"", that probably is the result of a controlled work-process and stems from underlying ideas about life, or some reshaped and refined account of certain deep experiences. The Room isn't even, as I was originally tempted to say, fascinating in the sense a natural disaster stuns you and leaves you awe-struck. More closely it resembles something that gets to you by its mere intricate, deeply nested strangeness- like a grotesque commercial that tries to appeal to people by showing something, that is deeply inept to evoke any consumer-reflex, but instead stuns, offends, alienates and consequently exposes the chasm of absurdity that is at its heart. To relate this in a more tangible way, I'll digress a little further by giving an example:I once -I can't remember where- saw some large, battered plastic sculpture, that was supposed to advertise some sausage-stand. It displayed an over-sized, anthropomorphic sausage (wrapped in hot-dog bread, I think) that poured ketchup upon itself and made a monstrously distorted face, that should suggest, I guess, it's enormous craving to devour its own (delicious?) substance (I don't know in which terms a sausage thinks about its own tasty appeals to itself).The point of this is, that such a thing of course does not generate in you impulsive sausage-cravings. Because it doesn't transfer anything about why a sausage maybe tasty- it instead contorts the whole mental picture of a sausage and produces out of it, in this case, an unspeakable being of nightmarish aspect(slight hyperbole there).Exactly the same thing happens in the Room. And though this may sound like a an implausibly bold or ironic statement, it's exactly how I perceive this deranged vision of human conduct, Tommy Wiseau gifted us with. The topics of this film –love, passion, envy, insanity etc.- are as familiar to us, as a sausage(I think this metaphor deserves to be stretched as much as possible). But they get reshaped in this film, so that eventually nothing is in its right place and the persons, whose turmoil is supposed to be displayed, are only resembling human beings in the way a sock-pocket, being waved in your face by a madman, who is shouting: ""Ai don care annymoar!"", does. The initial reaction, to such an affront to humanities grace, is naturally to be disgusted and put off by its grotesque bad- and ineptness. Just unconsciously feel that everything about this is wrong, and consequently damn it. But you need to open up- need to indulge in the infinite detail of stupidity, the unthinkably dense and compressed amounts of absurdity, every fraction of a scene contains. The film really does display a certain self-similarity in this respect: You think a conversation between some characters is embarrassingly moronic, then you zoom in, discover and savor how incoherently the dialogue propagates, zoom in further, see how unworldly, how alien the language of the single remarks is, zoom in to the see the clownish, completely unreasonable facial expressions that tile this flow of human caricature that sprang forth from the seizures that must be Tommy Wiseau's thoughts. So finally you commit yourself to the strange symphony this mythical figure, drenched in mystery, pieced together in its childish mind, allowing you to see the world through the eyes and brains of some sort of holy idiot.",The Room

Thank you Mr. Jimmym, your review actually set loose a bit of that Wiseaunian wtf syndrome back to me, it was almost like watching bits of the movie for the second time.Second of all, I loved this movie. Yes, I gave it a 10 star rating. Yes, I would do it again if I was just watching the movie for the first time. Yes, I am serious. This is in no way a mocking business.Third of all, thanks Mr. Wiseau for existing. I will not write any spoilers, for I'm afraid someone might bump into them accidentally, and that could ruin someone's experience. All I want to say is, if there is such a thing as a religious experience, watching ""The Room"" is the closest to that I'll ever get. It is a whole new dimension of being, feeling, existing. Could it be the twilight zone? Could God have come to earth? Could I be closer to something? Further away? These are all good questions, and there are no final answers for them. Therefore, these questions don't really matter. What matters is, I never felt so closer to myself and so further away at the same time. I often felt like I was watching a movie with aliens that were trying desperately hard to imitate human's life, but couldn't, or failed for a bit. There's something that's off, but I can't pinpoint it, I can't put my finger on it and say ""this is what's wrong!"": and that's the beauty of it. Mr. Wiseau was right, on an interview he gave about ""The Room"": you have to watch this movie at least twice, you won't understand it the first time. I've seen ""The Room"" 5 times now, and I still cannot explain in words the way I feel, nor can I explain what the movie really is, or what it is really about. Mr. Wiseau also tells us that this movie is meant to teach us something, to teach us to be better persons because, quoting ""If I lot of people loved each other, the world would be a better place."" I am not sure if watching ""The Room"" made me a better person. Although, I can honestly say, it has made me a happier person. And that my friends, is a precious beautiful gift.

Then, casting the script with mostly porn movie actors and himself, he produces, directs, shoots, edits and releases his 'masterpiece' without ever deviating from that first draft.

Unintentionally inept characters engage in progressively bizarre and unnatural interactions which seem to peak at erratic and unexpected intervals. The awkwardness of the actors is framed by strange pauses, jarring scripts and incredibly bizarre production techniques - there are ample 'deer in the headlights' moments, in which you can feel genuine sympathy for these people who are obviously so caught up in Tommy's strange and dominating creative control that they've failed to see any better.Other filmmakers play with similarly surreal concepts - David Lynch for example - but this film lacks anything resembling artistic refinement, insight or self awareness placing it far from comparison. It's kind of like watching a train crash in slow motion - random, incoherent, disastrous, accidental and ultimately painful. The sense of alienation emanating from this film places the audience extremely far from being able to relate to what's happening on screen, which leaves a lot of room for uncontrollable laughter given the right circumstances.The camera work and production techniques would not be out of place in many daytime soap operas, nor would the script and plot, but there is an undefinable quality which separates this movie from the sense mediocrity often found in such shows and instead casts it deep into the abyss of tragically bad film making where it will be forever trapped along with Wiseau's artistic integrity.

The film is a great LESSON picture showing the tragedy of an unfaithful mate or relationship which everyone considering getting involved in such a relationship should see-- they'll think twice before doing so. The story is dramatized with artistic sensitivy and good taste but the message is clear. The Room is a brilliant American black comedy. This is a film for everybody.,The Room
431,NPThirteen,"Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep, Cheeeeeeep.",10,29 November 2013,"Oh Hi Mark. You appear to be the expert. Johnny is a successful banker who lives in a San Francisco townhouse with his fiancée, Lisa. They share an intense relationship characterised by constant, passionate lovemaking. Despite this idyllic existence, Lisa has inexplicably become dissatisfied with her life, and one afternoon confides to her best friend Michelle and her mother Claudette that she finds Johnny boring. Although Michelle advises her to be grateful for what she has, and her mother counsels her that financial stability is more important than happiness, Lisa decides to seduce Johnny's best friend, Mark. Although he is initially reluctant, Mark gives in to Lisa's advances. Their affair continues through the remainder of the film, even though Mark appears reluctant at the outset of each sexual encounter and repeatedly tries to break off the relationship. Lisa, meanwhile, having come to the realisation that she ""wants it all"", decides to stay with Johnny for financial support and the material goods he can provide her. As the wedding date approaches and Johnny's clout at his bank slips, Lisa alternates between glorifying and vilifying Johnny to her family and friends, both making false accusations of domestic abuse and defending Johnny against criticisms. Meanwhile, Johnny, having overheard Lisa confess her infidelity to her mother, attachés a tape recorder to their phone in an attempt to identify her lover. Against the backdrop of Lisa and Mark's affair, numerous subplots involving secondary characters begin to develop: Denny, a neighbouring college student whom Johnny financially supports and ""loves like a son"", has a mysterious run-in with a drug dealer named Chris-R, whom Johnny and Mark overpower and take to the police. Denny also lusts after Lisa, ultimately confessing to Johnny his attraction; once Johnny tells Denny that Lisa loves him as her friend, Denny resolves to propose to his own girlfriend. Johnny takes on a mysterious client at his bank whose identity he is sworn to protect. Claudette experiences real estate problems, bemoans failed relationships, and informs Lisa that she has breast cancer. Michelle and her boyfriend, Mike (Mike Holmes), sneak into Johnny and Lisa's home to have sex. Peter (Kyle Vogt), a psychologist friend of Johnny's and Mark's, alternates between defending Lisa and assessing her as a sociopath, which results in Mark briefly trying to murder him. Each of these subplots receives little exposition, and none is ever resolved. At a surprise birthday party for Johnny to which all of his friends were invited, Steven, a previously unseen friend of Lisa's and Johnny's, catches Lisa kissing Mark while the rest of the guests are outside and confronts her about the affair. Lisa expresses no remorse, while Mark angrily urges Steven not to tell anyone. Johnny announces to the guests that Lisa is pregnant, only for Lisa to tell Steven and Michelle that she lied about it in order to ""make it interesting"". At the end of the evening, Lisa flaunts her affair in front of Johnny, who physically attacks Mark. After the party, Johnny locks himself in the bathroom, prompting Lisa to make plans to leave him for Mark. Johnny finally comes out of the bathroom and retrieves the cassette recorder he attached to the phone, and listens to an intimate call between Lisa and Mark. Claiming that all of his friends have betrayed him, Johnny destroys his apartment and then kills himself with a pistol. Denny, Mark and Lisa discover Johnny's body sometime later. Mark and Denny blame Lisa for Johnny's death, with Mark declaring he does not love Lisa and never wants to see her again. Denny asks Lisa and Mark to leave, but they stay and comfort one another as the sound of sirens grows louder. I fed up of this world! Hi doggy,what do you need money for? I did not hit her, this is rubbish, I did not hit her, I did nooot. This movie is good, and if you don't agree, then you just very bad, you not good, you, you just a chicken; Cheep cheep cheep cheep cheeeep. You're tearing me apart, Lisa! Do you want to stay alive? This ends now. So how is your s*x life?",The Room
432,dhamilton92,Speechless,1,31 August 2011,"This film has to be the greatest, worst movie ever made! Yet, this has to be my favourite film of all time, the one dimensional storyline, characters and plot development allow this film to be the most unique production ever released. The nonsensical establishing shots, camera angles, unconvincing green screens and sub-plots that seem to never scratch below surface level are a masterpiece, and I'd recommend this film to absolutely everyone. It is a fantastic work of comedy, that is both dark, cringe-worthy and bizarre...all the ingredients to make it a hit in the cult classics hall of fame. The storyline is simplistic, a love triangle between a loving fiancée, his unfaithful wife, and his best friend. But the paper thin plot has complete irrelevance in this film, it has no bearing on the fact that this is a marvel for all the wrong reasons. A review cannot explain, or do justice to just how incredible this movie actually is. Just get a copy of this film at all costs...you will not regret it.",The Room

434,JnpJea,"See ""The Room"" Again and Again",10,25 July 2004,"For the information of all the people who have written negative reviews for ""The Room"" on IMDb, I'm one of the cult followers. If you didn't have fun watching ""The Room"" multiple times with other enthusiastic fans, then that is your loss. There are so many enjoyable moments in this movie that a few flaws are inconsequential. The fact is, Tommy Wiseau's intention was to provoke the audience, and he has succeeded beyond anyone's expectations. In fact, on one who was involved in the production of this movie expected the audiences to react as they have except the director Tommy Wiseau. There are so many little interesting tidbits in each scene and so many emotional moments and ironies that ""The Room"" is entertaining from start to finish. If you have any doubts about this, get a DVD of the Audience Reactions..The fans are having great time with their impression of there favorite lines, such as ""You are tearing me a part, Lisa!"", ""If a lot of people love each other, the world would be a better place to live."", ""Hi, doggie!"", ""Chocolate is a symbol of love."" Also some fans are dressing like characters in the movie and tossing a football to each other during the movie. Now, I call that fun!Many people have commented that the beautiful San Francisco scenery makes them want to go there. As for me, it reminds me of the time I have been there. It's perfect setting for the plot of ""The Room,"" because the characters are sophisticated and affluent.I would like to recommend if the whole thing didn't grab you the first time, see it again, and again, and again, and again, and again and you will never be tired of seeing it!!!!!",The Room
435,thealmightybasstardo,You Call That A Film? (contains what for other movies would be spoilers),1,27 November 2012,"The next time I have an earth shattering bowel movement that leaves my anus torn and bleeding I'm going to be grateful that's all that is happening to me and that I am not in fact watching 'The Room' again... and when one day I am lying withered and ill upon my death bed, dying a slow death from either cancer or heart disease I'm going to rejoice in the fact that at least I am not suffering through 'The Room' again... Now, I have been hearing tales about this film for some years and it seems to be generally received by those who witness it as one of if not the worst made film of this millennium. That's got to be worth it hasn't it? Well, yes and no... The plot of 'The Room' is fairly simple - man loves woman, woman cheats on man, man kills himself... however the real problem is that it took the film about 50 minutes to actually make it clear that this was going to be the plot and the stunningly vague and indifferent way the story was presented amidst such side plots as the cheating whores mother having cancer or one of the minor recurring characters being attacked on a rooftop by a gun wielding drug dealer. The dealer was chased off and nothing was mentioned of it or his drug problems again, or in fact preceding this randomly inserted scene, and as to the whole cancer sub-plot, well, her mother mentioned it once and was told by her daughter not to worry and then it was dropped never to be seen again. I'm serious. It appears that Tommy Wiseau (who wrote, directed, produced and starred) doesn't have even the first idea of character development or in fact how to make a film, and by all accounts this cost $6million to make... So what else could be wrong then? How about four of the most painfully gratuitous and unrealistic intercourse scenes in the history of film within the first forty minutes? Presumably this was meant to titillate the audience or maybe to drum up some interest in the slowly moving and badly mumbled story but as a tactic it failed to do so spectacularly.Without wishing to sound too disrespectful if you look at the movies poster then you can see the face of Tommy Wiseau Negative and yet the first sex scene not only involves him as the leading male but also a great shot of his scrotum. Yup. I have seen that mans balls and it wasn't pretty. How on earth was that meant to sell the film? An interesting thing to note with it is that many of the actors (my apologies to any real actors out there) were not the initial ones cast as during the production many just, erm, left and so had to be replaced by understudies (or members of the crew) including the female lead... and boy does it show! There's a brilliant scene in the film where the four men are wearing tuxedos, one of them shocks the others by having shaved off his excuse for a beard and then they go outside and play catch. It may not sound brilliant, but when you take into account that there is no explanation for the fancy clothes, no explanation for the shaving and no plot based purpose for playing catch it suddenly becomes marvellous and a perfect example of how this movie was structured. Continually throughout there are pointless bits of dialogue and whole scenes that serve no purpose, they don't add to the plot or characterisation, they aren't even well shot! It pays to keep an eye out for some of the poorest points such as the camera going out of focus mid scene, badly synced dubbing (sometimes without anyones lips moving) and my favourite of cinematic tricks - not actually fitting everyone on screen at once when you were clearly trying to. There is no real sense of consistency or continuity here and that's probably why it's so bad... That and of course Tommy Wiseau who can hardly speak intelligible English. If you want to subject yourself to something as bad as bad can be then you might want to try this film, and I'd suggest a drinking game for it too - simply have a shot anyone (particularly Wiseau) says ""Oh, hi..."" or anytime someone says ""don't worry"", you'll be too drunk to care about the film within thirty minutes or less and will be drinking to most of the films dialogue too. Honestly, those are the two most repeated phrases in the film to the point where you'll end up cheering every time you hear someone utter them... it's a strange experience and quite frankly that's how I'd best describe it, as an experience. You won't be able to call it entertainment and you certainly can't call it art, but if you watch it then you do get the strange feeling that your brain is being horribly abused and might melt out of your head due to the inconsistencies and of course the repeated shots of Wiseau's face. In an ideal world this movie would be banned under the Genoeva Convention but as well know this world is far from perfect so you can just buy it on DVD, although I strongly urge you to steal it instead. Morally no-one will be able to fault you for not paying. Believe me when I say I could go on about all the ways this failed but would rather you just saw it for yourself, my words cannot do justice to it by a long way...",The Room

The acting is atrocious from all corners, the directing and script seem to be scenes from rejected movies sewn together only where Doctor Frankenstein produced something intelligent and provocative at least this resembles a bolt-necked, cat headed monstrosity with a left leg where its right arm should be.Too many death analogies? Sure, but what do you expect after 100 painful minutes staring at Tommy Wiseau? The jerky, creepy, inhuman, zombie like dialogue is the first example I've ever seen of human speech plumbing the depths of the uncanny valley. A kid who likes to watch his father figure have sex, (who incidentally has a love interest of his own we never see and a drug problem that amounts to half a scene of padding) a woman with no motivation in life other than to be thoroughly unpleasant in the national leagues, the ridiculous and inexplicable mother with cancer that doesn't seem to be slowing her down much... I could go on. There is no plot to this movie, there is no justification to anything Now we move on to the scenes that give this movie an r Rating, the sex scenes, the saviour of many a bad movie's sales. If you're looking for nudity cloaked by a story you're better off watching that one with the Swedish plumber with the horrendous moustache... or even pride and prejudice. This movie fails on both sex appeal and story. The doughy, fortysomething flesh dragging lethargically over the bed is about as sexy as filling two forty pound bags with meat and slapping them together. I honestly felt a little sick and decided to run a game leaving only the audio track in the background about 10 minutes in.That leaves us with one one question - is it so bad it's good? No. Just no. As previously mentioned this is right there in the uncanny, unfunny, unpleasant trough of any graph of likability you care to draw up. The dialogue is so jarring and stupid you just end up feeling numb and the acting is sub-children's nativity and that's not hyperbole. This movie was so bad RiffTrax actually waived their 'no R rated movies' policy just to cover this train wreck and that should give you an idea of how awful this is.Sorry, Mike and the bots, not even you guys could save this experience from being painful, nauseating and ugly in every sense of the word.

439,MarcelNL69,Don't be tempted by the cult-status talk...,1,27 December 2012,"I like a good cult movie and so i decided to watch ""The Room"". A copy was hard to find to begin with but i actually managed to get a DVD from a cult videostore in the city. In hindsight, i wish i didn't find it at all.The ""story"" is not only slow but also simply horrible. It's a stupid story about love and life with no real message in it. The acting is horrifying, especially the main character, Johnny, played Wiseau himself. And Wiseau's laughter.. oh boy.. his laughter. Every time he went 'ah-hah-heh-heh' it made me want to vomit. Every time he spat out ""Thats the idea!"" with his weird french-Canadian-Croatian accent, it made me want to throw the remote at my television.And whats up with the overdubs? It's clearly visible that only Wiseau's character Johnny had been overdubbed after the film was finished. And Wiseau did a bad job at that, too. Sometimes you even hear Wiseau talking when the character Johnny isn't moving his lips, at all. Insane.The love scenes are ridiculous, after maybe 25 minutes three (really bad) love scenes came by already (and i was by now bored out of my skull already).  Throughout the movie various music tracks are played. Wiseau for reasons that are beyond me decided to use classical music AND r&b music in the same movie. Makes no sense at all.Don't be fooled by its cult status. This movie is worthless and not worth the watch. Apparently, this movie cost 6 million $ to make, IMO sure anyone else could have done a better job for 50 grand. Basically you could describe this movie as ""poorly directed episode of days of our lives"" -- boring, slow and not worth watching a first time, let alone a second time.Avoid at all cost.",The Room

After watching the first few scenes of this film, my head was already shaking so much my neck started to hurt. At the same time it was impossible for me not to crack a smile. This film has the best worst acting I've ever witnessed. The star/director/producer/writer Tommy Wiseau should be in the Hall of Fame of bad acting if there ever was one. I'd describe him as a cross between Christopher Walken and Fabio, except he makes Fabio look like Daniel Day Lewis when it comes to his acting skills. It's not just Tommy who lacks in the acting department. Every single actor/actress in this film will make you want to cringe with every line. It doesn't help the already dreadful actors that the dialogue is absolutely atrocious.When it comes to plot in this movie, there are so many holes it's like Swiss cheese. I would try and explain the plot but there is barely one to begin with. I lost count on how many scenes that were in this movie that were absolutely pointless to the plot.

If one is looking for cinematic achievements, acting, directing, or just anything that relates to this planet in general, then stop, and turn around. ""The Room"" is not of this planet. It's not of this universe, it defies everything logical. It is of the mind of the Michelangelo of filmaking, Tommy Wiseau. Everything wrong with this movie is everything right with it. Let's take a look and see just what ""The Room"" is. After the credits in which we are told that Wiseau is the mastermind behind this work of art, we are introduced to a man that looks as if his face has been chiseled out of a tree trunk with a butter knife as he arrives home. This is Johnny. When he speaks one can easily confuse him for Vladimir Putin, a Bulgarian peasant, an eloquent French liaison, or perhaps the voice of God himself. He resembles and is in fact all of these things, but not all at once. His wife, Lisa, recalls memories of the girl back in high school that used to be hot but now is a soccer mom. Anyways, back to the story, their neighbor Denny, a young boy with enough libido to rival that of a football team states with an innocent grin when the couple goes upstairs to make sweet love ""I like to watch."" Of course you dear Denny. After watching Johnny thrust his member into Lisa's navel alongside a heart-throbbing R&B track, we are treated to see the beginnings of a love triangle. Lisa is no longer in love with Johnny, our blessed saint. She yearns for his best friend Mark, who delivers his lines so dryly, it rivals the drought in the Mojave desert.I can go on explaining the various subplots, all of which are dropped like an aborted baby. But this would be futile. One must see them for them self, to truly enjoy them. How can I explain the way Chris-R threatens Denny's life, and then Johnny shows up to take him to jail, and this incident is never heard of again? Where do I start, when telling you of the arrival of Peter the psychologist, who abruptly seems to die after tripping in a game of tuxedo football? Will you understand why Lisa's Mom's breasts have cancer? Or why the mysterious silk shirted man at Johnny's party feels the need to tell Lisa she's setting off an atom bomb? You won't, you cannot understand. You must watch. You must believe. Tommy Wiseau gave this gift, so others may have life. No one has ever delivered lines like him. No one ever will.

Tommy was truly passionate while making this project, and cared about every scene that was shot, even if he did it in all the wrong ways. Many directors today could care less about the impact their films have, and are only looking for a quick buck. Tommy on the other hand was looking to deliver a dramatic masterpiece to his audience. He instead created something much different, but it still has become insanely popular. Tommy wound up famous, and although his film is technically terrible, I have to applaud him for his effort and determination while making this film.If you have not witnessed The Room, I would recommend checking it out as soon as possible.

But boy, it may be one of the worsts but that still doesn't make it any less funny then it already is. It stars our main character, Johnny. Who is played by our lord and savior, Tommy Wiseau. But here's the kicker, Tommy Wiseau *barely* speaks English and talks with a really bad accent. Even when he attempts to be serious, his direction of his acting and voice is never portrayed correctly and offers some hilarious dialogue for all the wrong reasons. And for someone who also directed, written and produced the film, it comes off as a surprise. Anyways back to the ""plot"", Johnny lives in a Suburbian area in America I think, it's never explained where he lives. He lives with his future fiancée, Lisa. Lisa is without a doubt, the worst human I've seen in a movie. Lisa is supposed to marry Johnny but it turns out she doesn't like him at all (I don't blame her, really). But the fact that she cheats on his ""best friend"" (which is Mark by the way), and lies about whatever Johnny did to her just makes me cringe. She also has some banter with her mother MULTIPLE TIMES in the movie, and it goes like this: ""Marry Johnny."" ""No."" ""Do it, ya' female dog!"" Like I said, this same conversation happens multiple times, and it NEVER gets ANY better. Don't even get me STARTED on the sex scenes... There's also this weird ""subplot"" where this kid ""Denny"" is buying drugs from some guy and nearly gets killed when Denny doesn't pay him back. And like most bad movies, this subplot NEVER goes anywhere afterwards. The arguments between Lisa and her mother along with the sex scenes go on and on until we finally go somewhere at the end where it's Johnny's birthday. For some weird reason, Lisa decides to have a go at Mark at the MIDDLE OF THE PARTY until some random person finds them. Johnny notices sometime through and we have some HILARIOUS dialogue with even more hilarious deliveries like ""I AM FED UP WITH THIS WIORLD!"". Johnny locks himself in a cupboard like a little kid and Lisa calls Mark to have sex...again when Johnny is literally in the NEXT ROOM. This causes Sudoku...I mean, suicide. Mark, Lisa and Denny notice this and cry until the ambulance or police come...my brain has melted. The biggest problem with the movie is that there's virtually no pacing, direction and even plot. But it's so damn hilarious that it gave itself a higher score then what I should get and hell, I recommend binge-drinking while watching it.

454,nateisgrand,A Must Watch,9,9 August 2016,"This movie is a very unique experience, to say the least. This movie should be terrible with the prolonged sex scenes, the lack luster acting, and such a ill-conceived plot. Yet somehow, it isn't. It becomes a masterpiece of cinema and its because of the man behind it- Tommy Wiseau. Tommy's bizarre manner of speech, his erratic acting, and his Frankenstein-esque, hobo-esque appearance is so dumbfounding. By no means should he have made a film, but he did. He freaking did because he wanted to. The passion Tommy has is so strong it must have blinded himself of the movie horribleness, thus creating a blindfold of us in the movie. I loved the movie because it was a fantastic laugh and do not be surprised this movie is hilarious. But I believe the real reason its so funny is because Tommy put in his heart and soul into a movie he had no idea how to make so tried so hard to make something so good on an artistic, dramatic level but his incompetence made the movie into what it is, what its better being- a literal comedy of errors.",The Room

This movie is written in his same style of speaking. When you meet the man himself, you realize that this is just him in a movie. Truly this movie is Tommy Wiseau.Tommy Wiseau in real life is just as hilarious as this movie. The way he talks, what he says, how he walks and throws a football. The Room is like hanging out with Tommy Wiseau at any moment you feel like doing so. If Tommy Wiseau writes and directs any movie I think it will be the same as this movie.The hilarious one liners are endless, both from the man himself and in the movie. The bad acting, bad settings, bad just anything in the movie are just as funny.Now the experience of watching this movie by yourself is just not quite as fun with a few friends or even better yet at a theater with hundreds of people.

Please stop,1,7 December 2019,"Just because you have a lot of symbolism, doesn't mean that it is a good production... it just means that it can be looked into - if you can manage rewatching. The production value was just terrible. The script introduced characters abruptly and was so repetitive that the audience was throwing fits. It was not realistic, and was not committed to being absurd or surreal either. The acting was some of the worst I have seen in my life. The sex scenes were unnecessary and even comedic, drawn out, and my God, reusing footage (some called that symbolism for the love being repetitive, but I just call it lazy filmmaking. There were other ways to show that). Random 'plot points' are brought up, and never mentioned again (like 'We're expecting!'), and the sets were so amature (a dude fell at one point and the walls shook mad, there were green outlines on actors from the green screens... just make it stop). Overall, the film was a joke. It was an art house flop. Only watch it if you are at a midnight cinema, and can throw spoons and footballs at the screen.

467,Jacob_Spectre,"Can be described as nothing other than ""The Room""",4,11 October 2017,"What is there to say about this movie, that hasn't been said already? It's common knowledge by now that this film is bad. That being said, when you quiz the average person as to why it's bad, they don't know. See, this movie's hate cult is similar to the likes of the Transformers franchise, in that it's essentially a bunch of mindless sheep, whom of which half of the time have never even seen the movie. Sure it's terrible, but at the same time it's almost a masterpiece with just how much it got wrong in regards to the most basic of film-making rules. The characters are terrible, the cinematography is terrible, the acting is terrible, the directing is terrible, even the soundtrack is monumentally abysmal in every sense of the word. So with all that considered, why would I rate this seemingly awful film, a 4/10 rather than perhaps a 1 or 2? Well, honestly it's simply charming and it really shows that director, Tommy Wiseau, truly cared about what he was making, which is more than can be said for most films now a days. This film, despite it's plethora of long, awkward sex scenes and terribly written dialogue, was his baby and it really shows. Would I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good movie? No. Would I recommend this movie to aspiring film-makers looking to see exactly what not to do? Yep. And would I recommend this movie to a group of friends that want to sit back, relax and have a good time? Absolutely!",The Room
468,markrickert,"This brings new definition to the word ""bad"".",1,27 September 2017,"If I could give it a 0/10, I would. Believe me when I say this movie is so bad that the word ""bad"" can not accurately describe this travesty of a film. Tommy Wiseau is by far the most uncomfortable thing to watch on a TV. I say thing because I don't know what Tommy Wiseau is. His facial features are so oddly prominent. His voice sounds similar to dragging your finger nails down a chalk board. He's a polish American; only he was born in America. So I'm not exactly sure why he has such poor English speaking skills. Tommy wrote, directed, produced, and acted in this movie. His acting is so terribly atrocious. He and his cast of characters acted out their parts in such a mundane, uninspired, and cringe worthy manner. The plot is so simple. Tommy's fiancé Lisa cheats on him with his best friend mark. She then lies by saying Tommy hit her in a drunken rage. Tommy then proves his innocence but ends up committing suicide by the end of the film because he believed he was that hated and disliked. Sounds like a pretty simple plot right? WRONG! He some how turned a simple concept into a complex, horrible mess of brainless character development, awful dialogue, and a plot that literally goes in circles for about an hour and a half. This isn't a movie that is so bad that its good. This is just bad. A lot of people say that this movie was intended to be funny. Well that's a bunch of crap. This movie was intended to be a serious romantic drama about a guy who tried to fix the marriage that never was. The most serious moments end up falling flat and they eventually become hilarious for all the wrong reasons. Tommy says ""Oh Hi!"" about 100 times through out the whole movie. Its so f***ing annoying. The first line of the movie after the title screen ends is Tommy saying ""Oh Hi babe!"". That is literally how the movie starts. The characters talk in circles. And don't even get me started about the sex scenes. There's like 7 or 8 sex scenes. The actress that played Lisa was so uncomfortable during the first sex scene that they had to take unused scenes from the first sex scene and put it into the second scene. She was literally that uncomfortable that they had to re-use parts from the first sex scene, because she didn't want to film another sex scene. The rooftop scenes are undoubtedly the best in the movie. The green screen of the city background was done so terribly. Its obvious that there's a green screen in the back ground. Tommy Wiseau even had the audacity to nominate The Room for an Oscar! He thought it was that good! This movie absolutely blows my mind. The only way you can enjoy this film is if you are high, drunk as f*ck, or slightly mental. This movie is atrocious in a variety of ways. Watch at your own risk. If you receive brain damage as a result of watching this, don't blame me because I warned you. This movie changed my life and not in a good way. Honestly this is a terrible movie period. I wish Tommy Wiseau would have gotten the hint and stopped making movies then and there. But this isn't his only travesty of a film, but that's another review for another time.",The Room

493,mickmichelson,A True Outsider Masterpiece,10,7 July 2006,"Perhaps the best testament to the greatness of ""The Room"" is its utter indescribability, its curiously strong resistance to mimetic, second-hand description. Sure, you can easily sum up the banal, cliché plot, or approximate the mind-bogglingly amateurish acting and the hole filled, insanely convoluted, and just plain weird screenplay. You'll make yourself laugh as you quote choice lines (""Hi Doggy!"" ""I feel like I'm sitting on an atom bomb that's about to explode!"" ""The world would be a better place if everyone loved each other."" ""Oh hi _______!"" ""Chocolate is the symbol of love."" ""Cheep cheep cheep!"" et al) and mime Wiseau's hilariously awkward motions and slurred cadences (""It's not true, I did not hit her! I DID NOOOOT.""). You'll try in vain to convey the sheer weirdness of the incessant football playing, the hilarity of the jogging at the park, the brilliance of Chris R., the beautiful blue-screened rooftop, the horrific sex scenes that never seem to end, the mantra-like, gut-wrenchingly saccharine pop songs that accompany said sex scenes, and the inescapable, mind-erasing voids of Lisa and Claudette's mother-daughter one-on-one's. However, frustratingly for the would-be promoter of the film, these sorts of descriptions do little in the way of actually capturing the genuine magic that occurs when one sees ""The Room"" for the first time.After hearing about the film on NPR, my interest was peaked. Soon after, I discovered that there were several clips of the film available to view on Youtube. After watching the rooftop conversation between Johnny and Mark, and an excerpt of the tuxedo-clad football game, I was sold. Living over 2000 miles from Los Angeles, I knew my only option was to purchase the DVD, which retails for about $11 on Amazon. Later that week, I found myself staring at Wiseau's curiously droopy face and preparing, at long last, to watch ""The Room."" Words fail to describe my experience; I was immediately hooked. Now, several months later, I've watched the film close to ten times, and I can say without hyperbole that it has become more fascinating and hilarious with each viewing. If you're reading this and you're on the fence about whether or not to go to a screening, or to spend the $11-$15 for the DVD, fear not  you will regret nothing. In fact, you'll begin to wonder how you lived for so long without seeing ""The Room."" Well, what are you waiting for? ""DO YOU UNDERSTAND LIFE??!!""",The Room
494,Michelsons_Lover,"Ahhaha, You're right, isss good.",10,7 July 2006,"This movie is great. So complex, so intricate, so layered. A buddy of mine and myself could spend hours talking about this movie, trying to figure it out. We've both watched it multiple times and we're both not satisfied. You thought the scene changes in Memento where confusing? Try The Room. You find yourself always wondering what the heck is going on. That's especially true when the actors are talking. Who wrote this stuff? Tommy Wiseau is who wrote this, youngin'. Get to know him. Seriously. Wiseau not only made this movie, he MAKES this movie. Without Wiseau, you'd be wondering what the hell you're wasting your time for. With Wiseau, somehow the movie makes perfect sense, in a not making sense at all sort of way. Why is he always laughing? Is he nervous on the set? Is this the character of Johnny coming through? Who knows. This is why this movie is so great, it leaves you with so many questions. For instance, in the drunk scene, you find yourself bewildered as to the reason Lisa and Johnny choose to drink what could only be described as Vodka over Whiskey. And then Johnny confirms that the drink ""Isss goood"". How is that possible? You were confused by the time lapses in Primer? You ain't seen nothing. The Room not only has time issues, but it has missing scenes and sudden changes of behavior by the characters. A simple filler shot of San Francisco (Whenever you see Alcatraz, I recommend shouting ALCATRAZ!!!!!) can mean anything from, ""Well, it appears an entire day has passed""... to ""Well, I think it's the same day""... or ""Why did I just see that?"".So anyways, here's my final take, starting with the negatives:-The Room suffers from too many sex scenes. The first one is hilarious and disgusting (Does anyone know what's up with Wiseau's body?). After that, the sex scenes are boring, but still disgusting. The only good part is the original music, which is hilarious and addicting. -The Room also suffers from too many Claudette/Lisa scenes. These are really boring and the conversation is always the same... i.e. Lisa complaining about her relationship with Johnny. -Peter is a lame character.And then the positives:-Any scenes with the following characters are stellar: Johnny (Of course). Denny. Chris R (They tease us with only one scene with Chris R). Doggy (Again, a one scene tease). Mike (Watch his face). -This movie is highly quotable. There are too many great quotes to even mention.-The message of the movie ""How can you ever really trust anyone?"".That's about it. Do yourself a favor and watch The Room.

Really!,10,14 July 2020,"So, we bought this movie to make fun of it after watching ""The Disaster Artist"", and it actually sparked a pretty good conversation about art and using particular style choices to make a point. I think Tommy Wiseau is a persona put on to create mystery and intrigue, not unlike Sasha Baron Cohen's ""Borat"" or Steve Martin's/Dan Ackroyd's ""Wild and Crazy Guys"". This does have an adult film mixed with bad high school play feel, but in the end, there is a good, heartfelt message behind this movie.

When I sat down to watch the room for the first time, with much anticipation, it was everything I was looking for-- A movie so bad that it was actually good.

Films created with the best intentions that ended up so bad that they cross the line of their genres and move to the comedy section. Well the Room is the king of all these films. Written, directed and produced by that alien life form our world known as Tommy Wiseau, the Room tells the story of Johnny a banker who loves his Lisa so much and he's happy that has Mark as his best friend. Lisa by the way is an average looking chubby woman that in the Room's universe is hotter than Megan Fox. Mark is a model looking man that will not hesitate throwing you off the roof and apologize some seconds later. There's also Denny a neighbor/son/retarded weirdo that likes to watch people having sex. There's also Claudette, Lisa's mother who's dying of breast cancer. Other characters you ask? Well we have Chris R. who sells drugs to kids before getting paid, Mike and Michelle, two chocolate lovers (I mean that literally), Peter a psychologist who transforms into Steven and a dog that looks like a frog. Confused? Don't be. Everything makes sense in Tommy's mind.What make the Room superior to all of the 'so bad it's good' films is the fact that it's (like the trailer said) a riot. You see unlike other films that have 1-2 unintentionally funny scenes and the rest is a bore the Room is a non-stop extravaganza. Literally every scene has something wrong. Every scene has one quote that will stay in your mind forever. Because I forgot to mention that The Room is also the most quotable film of all time. The Godfather? Pulp Fiction? Star Wars?

It's a sad testament to the state of intelligence of some, but that doesn't detract from the movies awful redemption.There was no way this was made as a 'black comedy' on purpose. The ineptness present in ALL aspects of the film could only come about through an attempt to put Tommy's own high-school angsty experiences (probably) on tape.

This film, like Kaufmann's famous ""Mighty Mouse"" skit on SNL, comes from nowhere and pushes so many buttons of social awkwardness and artistic convention that the viewer often looks at everything differently. I know, that sounds a bit overblown and if you choose not to believe that the film was made to be what it is by design...well, it really doesn't matter. See The Room, see it with a group of people, bring a Nerf football, and, for the love of all that is right in the world, don't expect to see a movie in the traditional sense. Engineers have the phrase ""design only reveals itself when it fails"" and The Room is an incredible study in all the things that we don't usually think about that goes into a normal movie. Sure we think about directors, actors, scripts and cinematographers, but when was the last time you thought seriously about props-masters and costume designers? As all of the myriad elements of normal film making break down funny stuff happens.

The sex scenes were very well done and each one had a brilliantly composed soundtrack, although i will warn you there is a few of them so please keep children out of ""the room"". Tommy Wiseaus acting is misunderstood by many but if anyone can remember the acting troupes that used to show up to your elementary school to perform small skits about the dangers of doing drugs or smoking cigarettes; than you can understand the true merit of acting classes at universities such as Laney Community College in Oakland.

You can rate some scenes at a 7, but some of them hit you so hard you are left crying out ""12 out of 10!!!"" The acting is atrocious, the pacing is horrific, the unresolved subplots leave a bad taste in your mouth, the diolauge is first grade material, the writing just doesn't make sense, the choppy camera work is heretical, and the sex scenes... oh the slanderous sex scenes... the FOUR slanderous sex scenes.

We discuss what scenes could have been changed, what stories could have been tweaked, what plot points could have been done differently, and we thought about fifty different things to move this movie from it's current rating, to at least a 6/10. After further discussion though, we would change not one thing about this movie. Some would argue that tweaking the movie would change it from being ""So bad, it's good"" to just mediocre. Though I agree, I dont agree this movie is ""So bad it's good"". I would argue it's bad. Theres nothing good about it. It deserves to be the worst movie ever made.

I don't know what's happening.This is not some flick that's too dramatic, thus ends up being a comedy, hence making it ""So bad it's good."" No! There's much more to it than that. You're drawn into the movie, you become mesmerized, it's philosophical, it's beautiful... it's magical. I'm probabaly here, but there is only one comparison that comes to mind that us humans can ponder to existentially relate to the vibes this movie exudes.

I can only conclude that THE ROOM is my personal favorite film to be experienced in a group setting, my favorite film to introduce to people, and probably just my favorite film to sit down and watch all on my lonesome.First, what it's all about... It's a story about a man named JOHNNY who is a good person living in a world of devious people. His good intentions and simple, sweat dreams of a happy life begin to fall apart as those around him abuse his good nature; his loyalty, his giving, charitable spirit, and most painful of all his manipulation at the hands of his love Lisa. His betrayal through the sudden onset unfaithfulness of his beautiful bride to be is the driving force of the room: A good person surrounded by such undeserved pressures results in a film that is ultimately a view into the emotional and physical destruction of the character JOHNNY - an everyman, of sorts - as his friends, his lover, his job, and finally his grip on reality betray him.It's a dark film, but with many light moments as interesting, quirky characters drift into THE ROOM and JOHNNY's life, bringing with them unique personal situations, problems, and other glimpses into young, modern urban life in America. These flashes of brightness and Americana drama serve as a backdrop to the exacerbating suffering of our Hero.THE ROOM is a story of betrayal and loss, weaved in to a world of colorful, compelling characters. It is the saddest drama; it is the blackest comedy; it is the saddest love story. It's a lot of things, all of which you should see. Once you are 5 minutes into the film, you cannot turn away. It's a museum quality example of independent film in the United States.And yes, I should mention something of the acting, writing, sets and such. The performances and staging are poor compared to studio films. But the experience is incomparable in any context.

Its only as the film goes on, if you can hang in there, that the individual awful elements (the acting, the sets, the script- oh the script) build and build to a level of almost hysterical terribleness.

It is not that, it is so bad, that you have to gather around groups of your friends just to get all the different senses of how awful this movie is from each individual observer. And, it is not because this movie makes you want to see it over and over again just to really let it sink in, that you just may have seen the worst movie ever made.This movie is worse than the worse movie ever made. It is worse than that. Which is why it is so astonishing that it actually was made. This movie should not have happened. It should have fallen apart on the first or second day filming, when every actor should have realized that this movie will be a train-wreck. And that's the fascinating thing! They either didn't realize it (scary) or did realize it and just kept right on going (insanely comical).The beauty of this Tommy Wiseau masterpiece is that it lacks every quality of a masterpiece. There are so many clichés that the term cliché loses all meaning. Wiseau has done away with them. The acting is so terrible that it arguably breaks the forth wall, the actors come out into the audience, and attempt to continue acting anyway. Remarkable! There are no redeeming qualities of this film except one: the fact that it was made--that virtually everyone went through with it. That it made it to the big screen. It is a work of human triumph...not in the story, but in the making. This piece is a result of the triumph of Wiseau and all of his characters working together to put forth something they could call their own.It's like a human-porcupine baby that still suckled from his mother's teat, was cared for, was carried through thick and thin. And you just look at it, all grown up, and think, Damn, how did they not kill that baby--accidentally or otherwise? ""ANYBODY CAN DO IT--YOU JUST HAVE TO PUT YOUR MIND TO IT.""People always used to tell me that. I always thought, those people were different. Well, Tommy Wiseau is certainly different, but that saying has become a whole lot more inspiring to me.Well done, Mr. Wiseau. Well done on a job horribly, horribly done.(I gave it a 10/10, but not for the movie. If the movie existed in a vacuum, I guess you could still call it a movie and allow it to be rated...a .000001 perhaps.

Everyone acts like they barely know one another (e.g. lovers, best friends, mother and daughter all behave very awkwardly around each other). One friend, the psychologist just disappears. The mother announces she has breast cancer and no one really cares, including her. Grown men toss a football four feet from one another.

Yes, it is a terribly made movie, from every possible angle considered. And yes, it is terrible in a hilarious fashion, due in part to Johnny's extraordinary appearance, timing of delivery, accent, facial expressions, etc. What makes it better than other ""bad-funny"" movies, though, and even better than many ""real"" movies (yes), is that it excavates a small permanent space for itself in your brain upon the first viewing. You will be morbidly intrigued by producer/writer/director/lead actor Tommy Wiseau, not to mention his surrounding cast, and you will have many questions about the film. These questions will remain unanswered even upon repeated viewings. So you will scour the internet for anything you can find on Tommy or his film. His interviews will confuse you further. Every time he speaks, his words are so complex with oddities that you seriously don't know what to laugh at first. Tommy IS Johnny, or so it appears. This will lead to somewhat of an obsession, which is fine, as the film's cult following will welcome you. You will tell your friends about it, and each home screening will draw a larger crowd, but sometimes you will crave a solitary viewing late at night. And in some cases, you will even attend a public screening with a group of friends at your local theater tomorrow, with Tommy himself in attendance. Not many movies have this kind of impact, be it intentional or accidental. And that brings up another important question--was this movie a truly naive attempt at film, resulting in a purely accidental masterpiece? Or is it a masterfully crafted parody, so perfect in its subtlety that it masks Wiseau's wry comic ambition? You will ponder this question incessantly, thus exalting the movie to a platform of philosophical debate. Are we laughing at Tommy or is he laughing at us laughing at him? And if we are laughing AT him, does this make it a failure and/or make us mean spirited? Many comedies fail to make us laugh this hard at all. So regardless of how the laughs are achieved, this movie is undeniably a comedic success. Maybe we are just laughing at the movie's uncanny achievement and not at Tommy personally? And if the joke is on us, is it still funny? If this is the case, it's a brilliant satire of bad movies. Tommy wins either way. Perhaps this is the next frontier of comedy. Hiring rare, eccentric amateurs like Tommy to make serious films, and thereby effortlessly creating comedic gold. It'll be the next wave of reality TV. But for now, believe the hype and just see The Room. It generates the same personal reaction of awe and wonder that is usually reserved for the great classics of cinema. It is both entertaining and mind bending, in ways you'd never expect.",The Room

537,kissa302,Fantastic! A true Masterpiece!,10,4 August 2013,"The Room is one of the most hilarious movies ever made. In my opinion it's one of the most enjoyable movies out there. What makes The Room so amazing is everything; The hilariously bad acting, the hilarious script and dialog, just everything! Tommy Wiseau is a genius, whether he likes it or not. He made the horrible masterpiece that is in some sort of way a masterpiece. What i mean by that is that everything about The Room is perfect in a terrible way, which means everything with the movie is wrong which makes it perfect. The Room is something you don't want to miss. I Highly recommend it to everyone!",The Room
538,leftcoastjoe,The Room-The New Showgirls?,1,15 January 2004,"I had the privilege last night of seeing a free screening of ""The Room"", after being alerted by a friend in LA that it was a must-see due to the fact that it was quite possibly the worst movie ever committed to celluloid. It did not disappoint. I haven't laughed this much since the last time I saw ""Showgirls"". And don't believe the marketing campaign of it being a ""black comedy"". This new marketing strategy only came about after preview audiences were howling with laughter at the then promoted-as-a-drama-movie. The only thing ""black"" about this movie is the big, nasty stench left on the screen long after the projector has been shut off. It's pointless to even go into the ""plot"" because what little there is of one borders on surrealism due to  its inept unfolding. And even though Mr. Wiseau was at the screening, he failed to delight us with a Q & A session after the film finished.And I must commend Mr. Wiseau for a great job of getting his friends to leave an astounding amount of great reviews and ""10"" ratings to this board. ""The best San Francisco cinematography since 'Vertigo'"". Oh, they must be talking about the shot-on- a-Hollywood-soundstage-roof-shots-done-with-bluescreen-and-foggy-San- Francisco-badly-super-imposed-into-the-background.Mr. Wiseau, if you are rich, and you must have been to fund this film, please please please use your passion for cinema and fat wallet to produce, and leave the creative parts to people with a modicum of talent.And for lovers of bad cinema everywhere, see this film at any cost. And pray to the gods of cinema that we will be blessed with a release on dvd soon, so we can enjoy this masterpiece over and over and over...and if the gods are in a generous mood, might we also get ""director's"" commentary....a blooper reel....or is that too much to ask?",The Room
539,ruttiger1,This movie is like nothing else in the history of cinema,10,8 August 2010,"There are times in life, when you have to ask yourself, what is the meaning of life? For me at least this time in my life was when I experienced tommy wiseau's production of the room. this movie breaks the boundaries of the cinematic industry. Between Tommys mind blowing performance that rivals such greats as Clark Gabel in gone with the wind, Heath ledger as the joker, and Wilson the volleyball in castaway, and the fact that it was made with a budget of 2000 dollars, In my opinion it is the single greatest cinematic achievement of all time. Citizen Kane has nothing on this baby. Tears are falling on this keyboard thinking about all the passionate and groundbreaking scenes and lines such as YOU ARE TEARING ME APART LISA! and many other treasures. This movie breaks the laws of physics and even rivals Jesus Christ as one of the greatest things ever...nah im just kidding this movie sucks balls lol bro!!! XD",The Room
540,Zerofield,It's so bad its good!,10,25 April 2010,"Let me start this out by saying this movie is bad, and if you haven't seen it, then prepare yourself for an amazing ride.The story in this movie is simple, Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) is a man who we assume is quite well off, he is in love with a ""beautiful"" girl, Lisa (Juliette Danielle)who he plans on marrying. However, one day she decides Johnny just isn't doing it well enough for her, so she decides to go seek a new romance, Mark (Greg Sestero) Johnny's best friend. Throughout the movie new subplots are introduced but then immediately dropped and never mentioned again.The acting in this movie is what really makes this movie a classic. Tommy Wiseau is a master at cranking out hilarious one-liners that will keep me laughing for a long time. The other actors have there moments and laughs but none are as funny as Wiseau.Usually with movies like this, the movie starts out funny then dies down to a point where you turn it off to find a more stimulating activity. This does NOT happen with the room, it keeps you engaged with it from start to end. It should be noted that the love scenes are frequent in this movie and do tend to drag out a lot longer then they need to be.On a critical level this movie it terrible and should be excruciating to watch, but it does the opposite. It shows the true meaning of a movie, to entertain.10/10 Highly Recommended to people with a good sense of humour.",The Room
541,detrodoniv,The room answers many thing.,10,27 June 2010,"I liked ""The Room"" because it is a movie that does what it set out to do, tackle life's issues of ""love, passion, betrayal, and lies"". The cinematography and plot structure set the movie so as to not drift off subject and lose any momentum and energy that this movie so boldly is full of. The characters are people you can relate to, not like most mainstream production that depict grandeur.The Room tackles life's lessons with nearly all major characters and many minor characters. Connecting some part of myself with at lest one aspect of each character let me enjoy the movie in its entirety, instead of just picking favorites. If you are someone grappling with one or all of life's issues or have yet to realize the issues that you might have, The Room will leave you enlightened.",The Room

Thank goodness this is so, for this is the WORST MOVIE I have watched in my entire life. I have an extreme appreciation for movies and their cinematographies; however, this movies acting, set, directing, producing, over-the-top screen writing just gets me a serious lock every time i see it. The sexual scenes are unnecessary to the say the least, and NOBODY wants to see TOMMY WISEAU'S BARE REAR END! Words cannot describe the terrible acting in this movie. The blandness and clear lack of motivation the writers instilled in this movie is horrifying.I could continue for HOURS ON END of why THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST. However, i will say this. If you want to have perhaps the greatest laugh of your life, please do yourself a favor and watch this movie as a comedy. It is nothing more, and it certainly cannot be anything less, for this is THE LOWEST PIECE OF WORK EVER.NEVER WATCH THIS MOVIETommy Wiseau's buttocks still gives me nightmares to this day; you will end up like Johnny after this movie ends: one bullet in your head with your ex-wife trying to get it on with your best friend- make that two bullets...TWO BULLETS YOU WOULD NEED to come close to washing the horrid insipid memories of this trash away.

A real dilemma. I haven't obsessed over a movie like this ever. It's so terrible in so many places, yet done in such a way that it is hilarious and captivating. Arrgghh!!! Please tell me. 1 Star? Or 10 Stars? I went for 8 because the sex scenes were truly, truly awful. Nothing redeeming about them whatsoever.Best. Bad. Movie. Ever. I'm intrigued by the main character Tommy Wiseau. I also hear the supporting actor ""Mark"" has written a book recently about his experience working on The Room. And they have both teamed up again and are coming out with a new movie soon. I doubt they'll be able to recapture the essence of this movie though.",The Room

This movie is undeniably the worst movie I have ever and hopefully ever will have the misfortune of seeing. That being said, despite the terrible mutilation of entertainment, I have never laughed harder during a movie. Without a group of close friends to watch with this movie would be borderline impossible to watch. I mean that quite literally, the sheer stupidity is a true despicable display of humanity. Tom Wiseau should be sterilized, I mean that, another Wiseau in this world is the worst thing I can fathom. In conclusion, the movie is not only awful but is a laughable attempt at a cinematic punchline.",The Room

546,DrRosenscrotum,The Room.....a review,1,7 November 2010,"OK, so I stumbled on this film masterpiece by total accident. While I was searching for new apps. on my cell phone I came upon the ugly mug of Tommy Wiseau and his deep intense stare....similar to that of man who's been hit over the head with a frying pan. From there I had to download the sound board and instantly I was hooked. I had to get this movie no matter what the cost...and like the speed of Wiseau's painful laugh I had the movie in my hands a week later. This epic adventure takes place in San Francisco, I believe, with a background soundtrack that spins the hits from those classic 90's cine max after dark flicks. Wiseau's screen presence is similar to that of Patrick on SpongeBob SquarePants, comical and ridiculous. I'm not sure where to begin because I'm not sure if this is meant to be a serious script or one of utter illusion and embarrassment. It's random scenes and even more ridiculous classic ""lines"" are so out there that you can't turn it off nor do you want to recommend it to anyone because you're afraid people will think you ate crayons as a child.....a lot of crayons. I think it can be summed up like this, The Room is a movie that you will watch to laugh, watch to cry, and watch to completely make yourself feel better that you were born on earth and you don't get fed crazy pills everyday.",The Room

Granted, it's SUPER hilarious to watch, because everyone in it is an idiot, but there is no way, I repeat, no WAY that this was originally meant to be a comedy. It's intentions are FAR to serious, it's acting is too horrible to do on purpose, and it's plot is just, well, stupid. Those of you who will claim that the story ""has heart"" must be smoking some type of crack (or you must be related to Wiseau), because, if you haven't noticed, IT'S ABOUT A GUY WHO IS BEING CHEATED ON BY HIS FIANCÉE WHO'S MOTHER HAS BREAST CANCER (which is an unneeded plot development, as it is unimportant), A BOY WHO IS BEING ATTACKED BY DRUG DEALERS WHO APPARENTLY LIKES TO WATCH ADULTS MAKE LOVE (where are his parents??), AND AT THE END, HE KILLS HIMSELF! Now do you wanna go and try to tell me it was supposed to be a ""heartfelt black comedy""? NO. Because, It's a Cinematic Abortion in all of its non-glory.

550,ladypade,"Worse than Mission to Mars... And yet, 1000x more enjoyable",10,10 July 2003,"""The Room"", more aptly titled ""Inconsistancy: The Laughably Pitiful Time Machine"", left me feeling more conflicted than ever before. On the one hand, this is clearly the worst movie ever made.  Tommy Wiseau must be a billionaire, because I have no idea who in their right mind would fund this project.  The acting is horrific, the plot drops its incomprehensible tangents about as abruptly as they are surfaced, half of the film is composed of sex scenes (one recycled, by the way), and the dialogue is the most unnatural I've ever heard... it's a joke.  And speaking of jokes, all these qualities make ""The Room"" one of the most fun films I have seen in a long, long time.  I loved it - it's absolutely destined to be a cult classic.  While watching this adorable attempt at capturing reality, I couldn't help but long for the return of MST 3K so they could have a crack at this thing.  Fortunately, the audience picked up on my vibes and shouted out jokes and comments sufficient enough for my yearning.  I would recommend that every person in the world find a way to see this film because it will leave you feeling that much better about yourself.  I mean that sincerely. So long as you have a great sense of humor and don't mind that the characters' only motivation for action is simply their ill-explained personality traits, I guarantee explosive laughter throughout the surprisingly quick hundred minutes.  It's like nothing I have ever experienced before.  Wiseau's character delivers the line at one point, ""You're tearing me apart!!""  My sentiments exactly.  10 stars.",The Room

552,ewns-daddy,Crap. Pure and simple.,1,1 April 2011,"For lack of a better term, this ""film"" is crap. I can't believe Adult Swim, which normally airs humorous subject matter, would waste air time with this tripe. It's not funny - unless you think REALLY bad, less-than-amateur, middle school film projects deserving a D- grade are funny. I give it a D- only because it's in color. It's not deep, introspective, or worthy of any sort of serious thought or reflection, unless you're a complete idiot. Actually, the fact that I sat through the whole thing thinking that there may be some redeeming quality to this waste of time makes me feel like an idiot. The best part about it, if anything, was the fact that that tool blew his brains out at the end. I only wish that could have happened in the first two minutes.In a film, people are supposed to act. I think the people in this film try to, but it doesn't work. Maybe the point of the whole thing was to show how not to make a film? Hmm...Tommy Wiseau, your 15 minutes were done and gone after you appeared on Tim and Eric Awesome Show Good Job! (people with talent). See, in T&E ASGJ, when people act poorly, it's funny because they don't make an attempt at seriousness. You did, and it was just pathetic.

Having said that, this is the best movie i have seen in quite some time. i nearly defecated just struggling to concentrate on the story???? as i cried with laughter. Before i go any further i feel that i must mention that this movie cost the director SIX MILLION DOLLARS.......To begin, the sexual intercourse scenes are so perfectly timed with the awful r&b music that her climax and repetition of the fine director's buttocks only increase with the crescendo of the music itself. The camera angle through the waterfall is particularly excellent. I also feel that the amount of lines about how beautiful Lisa is has most to do with the fact that she is not in fact beautiful.One of the better traits this movie has to offer is the uncanny ability for every character to immediately explode in anger and then forgive everyone around them. Apparently every character has taken a bit too many steroids and do not know how to control there hormone levels at all. When we do find any conflict the subject is completely swept under the rug and then they have sex. Its like a mixture between a frat party and the real world and confused Asian tourists all combined to create the personality of this cast, then it was filmed. Also i feel that i have to mention that the old lady had breast cancer. This too was immediately forgotten along with the fact that Denny had some sever drug issues. Which in the words of our dear friend Johnny ""hey, that's life"".The intense camera angles and beautiful transition scenes were particularly clever because they only added to the confusion of what this movie was about. To add more confusion, they reused cut scenes and added characters without even telling us who they were, this too was very clever and cost efficient.Toward the end of the movie it really got good. Finally the two men fought over the cheating woman. They made up immediately. Then they fought again, Johnny walked away, and with a brilliant cinematic performance by the director/actor/cheap leather coat from Korea salesman, he trashed the set, touched himself violently but sexually with Lisa's dress and shot himself in the mouth.words will never explain this movie, YOU MUST WATCH THIS",The Room

Really, if Orson Welles were alive today, he would wholeheartedly agree that the Room is infinitely better than Citizen Kane. Tommy Wiseau's acting brings back fond memories of the likes of Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino. Every motion and word is said with such realism and emotional power that it is occasionally hard to take it all in. The wonderful supporting cast also lend sparks of brilliance. The writing is phenomenal, and brings to mind such classics at the Coen Brothers' masterpiece Fargo and Charlie Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There are a number of fascinating subplots in this movie, but they are all woven together with a narrative depth similar to PT Anderson's Magnolia. And finally, there is the cinematography. As evidenced in the frequent shots of San Francisco that appear throughout the film like chocolate chips in a cookie, the camera-work of The Room is something to be marveled at.

566,fajitgeydoy,My delirium,1,10 May 2012,"After I watched this film I felt the urge to rivet a large fan to my mother's priceless heirloom coffee table and use it as a vehicle with no wheels, so I could transport myself to the city centre, making heads turn as pedestrians witness the table legs scraping against the tarmac, in order for me to get a tattoo of Tommy Wiseau's chamois-like face on my hip. That is a small analogy of what this film made me want to do: I wanted to be incoherent like it. I was inspired by the inept acting, the gorgeous utilisation of continuity errors, and the reflection of the ceiling fan in Johnny's buttocks. They looked like a pair of trophies, passionately polished with a buffing machine. The cast wanted me to smear Vaseline on the television as a token of my gratitude towards the un-clumsy variety of age differences, defeating the awkwardness of social interaction between the characters. I would never have thought an 18 rated film could have felt as if I was watching a Universal - suitable for all ages. Oh Tommy, this could have never happened without you.On a serious note don't watch expecting some soppy romance. Expect a train-wreck of bromance, sex accompanied with blatant porn music and overly-hyperbolic grunting and American football in tuxedos. And really, really bad acting. This film has no form of quality control behind the scenes, Wiseau just went ""that'll do"" to everything.",The Room
567,Rumpelkombo,A Very Different Kind of Awful,9,15 May 2012,"Most good movies are credited as having a coherent plot, a skillful display of editing, and well-developed characters that the audience can easily relate to. In such films we would feel our pulses racing as the lead character finds himself in a dangerous circumstance, we would cheer as the villain is brought to justice, and we would cry during the death of the very characters that we have grown to love as the movie has progressed. If you were to watch Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"", you would find that this is most definitely not the case. The writing, directing, editing and acting in this movie is so hilariously unbelievable, is of no depth nor substance, and is about as close to ""real life"" (as Wiseau claims) as a toaster is to passing off as a squirrel. It's just not possible.But herein lies the irony of The Room. If it is so incredibly unbelievable, then why is it loved by audiences everywhere? What separates The Room from other ""bad"" movies such as ""Garbage Pail Kids"", ""Howard the Duck"" or ""Kazaam""? Why do we (or I, at least) love ""The Room"" so much and not every other awful movie in existence? It is, like the title of this review suggests, a very different kind of awful, and the reason for it, I believe, is the Producer/Director/Writer/Lead Actor himself, Tommy Wiseau.Anything about The Room that is of note should be credited to Wiseau. He did, after all, write, direct, produce and star in the movie. To summarize, the film is about a banker named Johnny and his fiancé Lisa, the latter of which is having an affair with Johnny's best friend, Mark, and... well that's about it. The large majority of the film is made up of scenes that either present the same ideas as earlier scenes or serve absolutely no purpose to the plot whatsoever.""Yes, yes, that's all good, Rumpelkombo, but why do you like the movie so much?"" Well, curious reader, like I mentioned before, I credit all of the brilliantly pathetic qualities of The Room to Wiseau. The reason why The Room is so unique as a bad movie, in my opinion, is because Wiseau himself is so unique. Until ""The Room"" came along, he was completely unknown, and even today not much is known about his past. He claims that he was born and raised in the US, despite having a mysterious European accent, he has not fully disclosed the methods by which he raised the $6 million budget for the movie, but most importantly, he sees The Room like a mother sees her own child; a product of his own self that he believes to be a beautiful and perfect representation of his thoughts and ideas - a tragedy that captures the betrayal and downward spiral of the ""normal"" human being. Imagine the shock he received when audiences burst out into laughter at the film's premiere. While George Lucas chose to sever the ties between himself and ""Howard the Duck"", Wiseau has remained more proud of ""The Room"" than anything else. Wiseau takes himself so seriously that you can't help but laugh, and if I were to point out every single hilariously awful aspect of this movie I'd be here for weeks.I should probably note that, as such, I don't believe the actors or the crew are at all responsible for ""The Room"". The crew only did what they were commanded to do by His Royal Highness and the actors, to their credit, were given very little opportunity to improvise, or to even become familiar with their characters. An article by Robyn Paris, who played ""Michelle"", describes Wiseau's hilariously unprofessional method of casting actors (""You just won the lottery. Go!""), how she was given twenty minutes to learn her lines and how the actors weren't even allowed copies of the script because... wait for it... Wiseau was afraid the actors would steal it. No, I'm not joking, search ""How 'The Room' Turned Me Into a Cult Movie 'Star'"" and click the first link. I'll give you a moment to read it if you'd like. I'm not going anywhere.The reasons I didn't give it a 10/10 are trivial, but nonetheless I saw as having a negative impact on the movie's brilliance. Firstly, I had to see Tommy Wiseau's hideously wrinkly rear end. One word: UNNECESSARY! I strongly recommend keeping your hands free for the first ten minutes of the movie in anticipation for this moment. It happens just after Johnny and Lisa have sex. You're welcome. Secondly, *SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER* Johnny dies, meaning that there is little hope for a sequel... unless it involves Johnny's ghost haunting Lisa after she decides to get back together with Mark in which case this movie is, wrinkly buttocks aside, immediately brought up to a 10/10. ""You are tearing me apart Lisaaah! Ooooh!"" In short, Tommy Wiseau is the reason I love ""The Room"". There are so many interesting mysteries surrounding him and so many things wrong with his idea of a ""good movie"" that it is near impossible to not see the ironic brilliance of ""The Room"".",The Room

569,redcoyote45,A fine example of how you can polish a turd and make it gold.,10,2 August 2012,"First off, you'd be doing yourself a disservice watching this movie by yourself; this is the type of film you grab a few buddies to watch and revel in its glory. Despite being marketed as a black comedy, you can tell the actors of this movie were trying their hardest. This movie is unintentionally funny due to the over-the-top performance of lead and director/producer/writer Tommy Wiseau as well as...there are too many flaws and errors to list. The plot is basically soap-opera cheese brought to a new low with random sub-plots that are discarded the next minute, characters who appear out of nowhere and deliver laughable dialogue, and stock footage that composes nearly every scene transition. This movie has had such an impact on me that everywhere I go, I am driven by a compulsive need to show others this movie. 10 stars because, frankly, this film was very entertaining and will have you spewing movie lines for the rest of your life with its hundreds of memorable quotes. If you're a fan of terrible low-budget cinema, this movie is an experience that should not be missed! Hats off to Mr. Wiseau for making this gem.",The Room
570,fattymcevilpants,A Beautiful Atrocity,3,24 March 2013,"I believe this movie obtained it's huge fan-base because of Mr. Wiseau's incessant plugging. I fell in love with this movie almost immediately and have seen it many times since the first viewing. Part of the initial reaction is due to another IMDb review in which the author goes into great depth on how repulsive the love scenes and the story as a whole are. I brought this movie to a friend's to show her and she accused me of trying to watch a soft-core porn with her. It was awkward to watch even on my lonesome. I would have to say my favourite scene is the flower shop scene (the transaction between Tommy and the florist is immaculate). To sum it up, this movie is comparable in quality to Birdemic.

The dialogue was clearly written by someone lacking fluency in the English language, there are subplots introduced then discarded, the acting is often wooden and uninspired...but it much, much greater than the sum of its parts.Tommy Wiseau is why. He wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this unique film, and he carries it. Despite very little acting talent, and fleeting grasp on English, he has an inexplicable screen presence. He is one of those actors you can't take your eyes off of. I can't tell you the number of times I've watched this movie...and I love it every time.My rating of 2 is a measure of the objective quality of the movie, but I assure you, if I were told I would only be allowed to see 5 movies before I died, this would be one of them (also, a middling movie gets no attention...one of the lowest rated films ever will get noticed).

I'm surprised I even decided to watch this monstrosity of movie because just watching the few clips the Critic used in his review was almost unbearable. BUT, I digress---this movie did get a laugh out of me, even if it obviously wasn't intended.Like everyone else has already mentioned, the acting was horrendous. I couldn't believe what I was watching...literally couldn't believe because the acting was not believable at any part of the movie. I felt no connection to any of the characters or to the story. I didn't feel bad, like I should have, when Johnny took his life. It wasn't just because there would be no more silly lines coming out of his mouth, but because there was no in-depth connection with him that I usually feel for a character when they die. Mufasa's death was more traumatizing than this.And of course, everyone talks about the sex scenes in ""The Room"". Seriously the most awkward sex I've ever seen in any movie...usually it's smooth and passionate and most of all, again, believable. Oh, and I loved seeing Tommy Wiseau's backside...he should just go around naked from now on because I'm sure people want to see that! Not. Why was this even called ""The Room""? Was it because Johnny and Lisa had awkward sex in a room? Heck, it should have been called ""The Spiral Staircase"", if that's what they were getting at! The title is even misleading! It sounds like a horror film, like bad things happen in a specific room and you just don't go in there. But no. There's sex and death in one room. Wow.I have to say my favorite line in this movie was when Johnny was ""raving"" about how he didn't hit Lisa. I laughed so hard, I cried, and watched that scene a couple more times. The guy didn't even look mad when he threw the water bottle! (In fact, did Tommy have ANY expression on his face through the duration of the movie?) And then the quick, nonchalant ""Oh hey, Mark"" felt misplaced and awkward after the ""rant"". As if he knew Mark was there and planned to walk out ""griping"" about Lisa, then pretend he didn't know Mark was there.Well, if anything, this movie made me laugh. So many things made me uncomfortable because of how they were presented to the audience; I couldn't sit back and enjoy the movie at all. There was nothing to enjoy! So I thank the Nostalgia Critic for directing me to this film so I could see for myself how hilariously terrible it is. From now on, I think I'll let him remember it so I don't have to.",The Room

I was actually surprised considering I'm not the hugest of film buffs (even though I'd like to be) at how many films I actually remember watching. In order to mark each film I'd give a rating, some films I remember vividly, some not, I'd just give some thought of how much an impression a film made on me and I'd give it the related score. Sooner or later I made it to ""The Room"". Yes I know, objectively, this movie has miraculously missed the mark in possibly every subcategory you could rate a film by. I'd say that the camera-work Isn't that bad in comparison to other horrible movies, but considering the budget this film had they could probably have afforded a decent crew. Besides that though, the script, the acting, the sets, the soundtrack...all these things are so bad in the most unique of ways. You ask yourself how is this even possible?If your a fan of the Room you know the back story, you've read the book, you've watched the interviews, and most of you are simply fascinated, just like me. The Room is Actor/Director/Producer Tommy Wiseau's brain child. Tommy is well... an eccentric man with a mysterious past. This film heavily bares his stamp of approval at each and every stage of production. When you delve just a little beneath the superficial layer you realize you are actually viewing one of the most deeply personal movies ever made. You notice that all these other actors, they are just forcing themselves to deliver these ridiculous lines that Tommy wrote and it just seems strange. Every character is actually Tommy interacting with Tommy.More skilled writers and directors are able to be empathetic and create dynamic characters that are believably distant from their own ideals and personality. Tommy is not one of those men. He cannot speak in metaphors, he cannot be subtle. He poured out his heart in this movie... the script and he's tried to disguise it as best he could.It's kind of tragic considering the whole world is laughing at him now. Personally I believe a good movie is one that leaves a lasting impression. This movie definitely has, probably more than any other other film I've watched. You are left fascinated by this persona and his unique personality. Watching this movie for the first time will be hard to comprehend, it's a fascinating achievement. Bad is something we can all reproduce, we can all fail miserably at doing a myriad of tasks. This is a movie no-one in this world besides Tommy could have made, an obviously damaged individual with a strange perception of everything and anything human. This is a movie best enjoyed by those willing to be empathetic, those who will genuinely try to understand who was behind the lens and what he was trying to achieve.I give it my full recommendation.",The Room

A true auteur, Tommy funded this, his dream project, and kept it in theaters for years until the world finally relented and acknowledged its 'greatness'. The story, the writing, the direction, the acting, the set design, the 'special effects', all combine to form a perfect storm of suck.

582,madeline-ragusa,An unintentionally genius film with a complex yet unique message,10,20 March 2018,"What Wiseau's, ""The Room,"" purpose is is highly unclear. Wiseau's own description is is that a room contains good and bad things, though this does not seem well developed, leaving the viewer to decide what the underlying message is. At first glance with no analyzation, it seems that the theme is ""trust nobody."" However, the main characters are static and flat in every aspect, and contain no last names, one must consider that this film is not just about Lisa, or Mark, or even Johnny. Wiseau's, ""The Room"" isn't a statement about the perils of a love triangle, it is a satirical commentary on a greater societal issue circulating around humanity and how no matter what we get, we will never completely be fufilled, relieved, or reach full satisfaction. Lisa is not satisfied with Johnny, Mark is not satisfied with his relationship with Lisa, Denny will not get Lisa, and Chris-R will not receive the money he wants. The only one exception to this idea is Johnny. Why? His naivety protects him from knowing what Lisa and Mark are engaging in, which in turn would show that Johnny does not recognize what is being unsatisfied in his life. In summary, this is not a mere love triangle that overtly puts forth, ""trust nobody"" but it is more or less a message of ""Satisfaction will never be reached by those who aware.""",The Room

Johnny (writer/director Tommy Wiseau) has everything a man could ever want: great friends, a good job, and a gorgeous fiancée named Lisa (Juliette Danielle). But Lisa's innocent act masks the fact that she's looking to bring Johnny down, and her manipulations are tearing Johnny apart. As Lisa informs her cancer- ridden mother, Claudette (Carolyn Minnott), that Johnny hit her (he did not hit her, that is bull$&*t, he did not), Johnny's best friend, Mark (Greg Sestero), finds his resistance to Lisa's seductive charms weakening. Meanwhile, local orphan Denny (Philip Haldiman) looks up to Johnny, and needs the older man's help after the teen rips off a drug dealer. What kind of drugs? It doesn't matter. Then guys play football in tuxedos, because you can play football anywhere.

Believe me if you ever get the chance to go to a screening I highly recommend it, you won't regret it. Right from the moment Tommy first appears on the screen the film is utterly shambolic, so many weird moments, so many pointless establishing shots, dialogue that no human being has said or ever will.

I just recently saw this movie for the first time, and am already hooked. I cannot wait till next month when it will be shown in Hollywood again. Don't expect a good movie by any means when watching The Room, but instead, expect a movie going experience that you will never forget. Just hearing the comments veteran Room viewers yell out at the movie screen is enough to make you want to come back for more. The movie has NO CONTINUITY WHATSOEVER. It appears that the movie was never edited and that scenes are completely out of place, or in the movie for no reason. Several shots are reused scene after scene to save money on production costs. Yet, these things that are so wrong as far as regular movies go are what make The Room such a great movie. The fallacies are intentional and should be taken as such. Also, a big plus to the overall experience is the question and answer session before each screening by producer, director, writer, and lead star Tommy Wiseau. At least that is the case at all the Hollywood screenings at the Laemmle Sunset 5 on Hollywood Blvd. My advice to anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet is to see it with a friend, or a lot of friends, so that you can crack jokes with them while watching the movie.

Is there possibly some sadomasochistic comedy genius behind this film and it's train wreck film-making? It could help explain the reason why every month hundreds of people crawl out of the underground of Sunset Blvd to attend the Laemmle screening at midnight.

I am honestly surprised that this film is not number 1 on IMDb, it should be an everyone should rate it 10 stars out of 10. It is a rare cinematic gem that is so enjoyable, no matter what you were expecting, no matter what you know about the plot it is the most enjoyable and heart-warming hour and forty minutes you will ever spend in your life.

While i agree that it is awful, i love this movie for the same reason people love Birdemic or Troll 2, going in you know it is a train wreck, but if you get past all of the critical and negative hype and watch it for yourself not as a drama, but as a dark comedy that is so bad you have to laugh, i know you will see it in a different light.

Truly a step forward for all the disabled people! Tommy Wiseau shows how you can still follow your dreams no matter what's in your way. And that he worked with porn actors is such a daring move! I wonder where he found these people, and if they had any opinions on his script? Anyway I think he might have made the best comedy in the history of film making.

I hope a sequel is in the works, I'm sure it will make well over twice as much as the this one did. You know what, I actually give this film a Spoon out of 10. A work of art if I may say so.

598,alford_brett,You're Tearing Me Apart Tommy,10,28 September 2014,"Tommy Wiseau manages to do something amazing with The Room that not many directors/producers/writers/actors can do with their pieces of work. Never before has a movie made me feel so confused, not about the plot of the movie, but about myself. After viewing The Room, I was not sure if I enjoyed what I had watched or if I utterly hated it. The main thing that did this to me is how the film presents itself. It is supposed to be watched as a drama and is meant to make the audience identify with and feel for Johnny, but when viewed in this manner, the movie is just awful. Nate Jones describes what's wrong with the film perfectly. ""The actual film, though, is like a Koch snowflake of badness, wherein any scene has an infinite number of things wrong with it. Conversations start and stop and change topic at random, and the characters speak a strange brand of English that sounds like it has been filtered through three different Internet language translators,"" (Jones). Despite this though, I found myself enjoying Tommy's film. I do not think he meant to do it, but in making a film so horrible, he possibly made one of the best comedies I have ever watched. It's everything about the film that makes it so horrible, that also makes it so amazing at the same time. The moments of the film where I would normally stop watching, were the moments that pulled me farther into Mr. Wiseau's terrible narrative.One of the most apparent parts of the film that is so terrible is the performances. The combination of Tommy's actor choices and writing make for some very interesting dialogue, and by interesting I do not mean in the sense that it was insightful and easy to follow. I mean the exact opposite. The script sounded like Tommy scrapped the whole thing by putting it through a shredder, and then in a moment of realization he decided to save it. There are lines that are used way too repetitively and the film really lacks any truly complex thoughts. However, among all the garbage that this film is comprised of, there are some gems. This film, is one that I quote very frequently simply because there are a number of lines that between their outlandishness, presentation, and comedic value are just so much fun to say. This is another thing about the film that really makes me confused. This film is so awful, but yet it makes it onto my exclusive list of my most quoted films. Me repeating lines from this film such as, ""Oh hi, Mark,"" and ""You're tearing me apart, Lisa,"" shows that this film has stuck with me in a way that very few films do. This is just another way that Tommy has managed to make me so confused about myself. He as physically been able to put his words into my normal conversations, despite his film being so awful. Maybe that's just what Tommy is good at though. I have done some reading and have found some interesting information, specifically what Niki Boyle had to say about his past; ""There's also a chapter towards the end of The Disaster Artist when Greg describes Tommy's 'Birdman' phase: upon arrival in San Francisco in 1978, Tommy commenced building his business empire via the sale of toy birds and yo-yos on the Wharf,"" (Boyle). Mr. Wiseau used to be a salesman, and maybe that's why The Room has stuck with me. He sold his idea to me, and continues to sell it to anyone who decides to plunge into his masterpiece, in an unorthodox and effective way.To conclude, this film is probably the worst one I have ever seen. Tommy Wiseau, being the centerpiece of this film, did a terrible job at presenting the story how he wanted to. His writing, casting, producing, and directing do nothing to help this film. Somehow though, I loved it. Even a few months after viewing it, The Room is still making me so confused. I want to hate it so much, but yet I just cannot. I would rate The Room at ten stars out of ten.Boyle, Niki. ""Interview: Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero of The Room."" The List. N.p., 10 Mar. 2014. Web. 28 Sept. 2014. Jones, Nate.

607,gpm-50631,I'll record everything!,10,21 October 2016,"When I first saw The Room, I laughed my as* off. But the more I watch it, the more it feels like a horror film. This isn't (just) because of the vampire-like look of at the time either 30 or 50 year old Tommy Wiseau (no one knows his real age, either its a well kept secret or he just forgot) but more because of how the film was created. After watching this incredible cluster fu** of a ""film"", I learned that this was created with the intent to win best picture, to be the next ""A Streetcar Named Desire"". What? Tommy thought this would make him a star, so he created this... um... thing to show the world the talent he had. Clearly, he had none. He was a jerk to pretty much anyone who worked on the project, and was a complete creep throughout the production. The funniest thing about this was that HE was the one causing problems, not anyone who he complained about! It took 32 takes for the famous ""I did not hit her"" scene, and lost his crap on a daily bases. He even threw a water bottle at a girl who asked to get a drink of water. On top of the weirdness of Tommy, he owned a clothing store in San Fransisco, two apartments, and got 6 million dollars from the film's ""producers"", which, at the time of filming The Room, were all dead.It's one of the worst scripts of all time, it has the most uncomfortable acting that you have to see to believe. It has the most uneven tone of anything to ever hit a movie theater and makes me question a human's ability to determine whether or not something is complete trash. Because of this, it is one of the greatest films I have ever laid my eyes on. Though it is supposed to be a drama-thriller, it's the funniest comedy of the 2000s, and puts a smile on my face every time I watch. The most impressive thing about it, though, is it's lasting impact. I have attended one of the many late night showings of this film in a movie theater. In fact, the cult following of the film is so big that when you attend these events, there are traditions to complete the viewing experience. From throwing spoons at the screen to being allowed to yell at Lisa for making poor relationship decisions. This isn't just a terrible film, it's a way of life. It's a world you can get lost in. This includes watching hours of videos trying to figure out what kind of mental disease Tommy Wiseau has. Spending money on the book on how the film got made, the copy of the Blu-ray for yourself, the copy to give to your friends to prove something this shitty exists, and pretty much anything you can find on the official movie website. Yes, this is a film that is truly terrible, but due to the amount of love and passion Tommy put into the film, the amount of enjoyment I get when I watch this pile of garbage, and the following that it has which most great films can only hope to get, I'm giving it a 9 not just because enough people give it a 1, but because it (despite it's many, many faults) is the most re watchable movie I have ever given a 9 to.

Tommy Wiseau created a film so terrible that it has become a laugh-out-loud comedic hit within a large cult following. The production of Wiseau's passion project is widely known as being extremely chaotic and itself a hilarious story, as displayed in James Franco's film The Disaster Artist. Horrible camera quality caused by use of mixing digital and film, terrible use of lighting, atrocious screenplay and performances, and countless horrid sex scenes make this film a Marvel unlike any other.

It's just that IMDb says that all my future reviews will be discarded if I write a spoiler. So, spoiler alert...kindaHow does one describe Tommy Wiseau's 2003 directorial debut (and may I add, masterpiece), ""The Room""? Well, much like the work of other fantastic filmmakers such as Neil Breen and Derek Savage, you can't. It's simply impossible. After seeing this movie... you know what? I'm not gonna refer to this as a movie anymore, because it's not. So allow me to begin my sentence again. After seeing this work of art, my life was changed. I never looked at anything the same way ever again. I never greeted certain friend ever again, without saying, ""Oh hai mark."". I've never looked at two people playing football the same without imagining one of the guys saying, ""I have problem with Leesah, she sed dat I heet hah."". Allow me to make an argument, in which I argue about the arguments that have been argued about this art piece. First off, some people say that right off the bat, the film shows some locations that were never show again. To that, I say that I believe that Wiseau's meaning with that was that the locations, just like Johnny and Lisa's relationship, is shown, and when it ends, we never look back. We don't see it again. Next up, some say that the performances were bad. But I believe Juliette Danielle's portrayal of Lisa was vigorous and unforgiving. It was a metaphor for how mean and cruel the real world is, and that nice guys finish last. But all jokes aside, I believe this film is something that must be witnessed by ALL people. It's should be on one of those Buzzfeed lists like, ""Things you must do before you die."". So if you haven't already, see The Room. I hope it changes your life, like it did mine.",The Room

619,1337ninjer,One of the best times you can have on a Saturday night.,10,28 August 2005,"Going to see ""The Room"" on a Saturday night is simply one of the best times you can have in the Los Angeles area. From the moment Tommy Wisseau comes out to interact with the audience and lasts late into the night, long after the movie is finished when you and your friends talk about what a great time you had and plan on how you will get other friends to come see it with you next time.I have actually seen this movie several times and I can honestly say that there is much more to this film than one can absorb in only one or two screenings. It takes at least three screenings before you even begin to see past the carnival atmosphere of the audience and the comedic dialogue (both in the movie and in the audience).Behind this seemingly absurd presentation is actually a powerful message. It is a tale that all of us have either experienced ourselves or will most likely experience some time in our life. It is a story of love, lies, friendship and betrayal. Within this story lies not only great words of wisdom, but also a grim warning of which road not to take.I would also like to take a moment to address some comments I have heard about Tommy Wisseau himself. First, I would like to point out that personal attacks on him have nothing to do with reviewing his movie. Second I would like to note that all of these attacks (he is pompous, arrogant, etc.) are patently false.I think many people see Tommy during his interaction with the audience and can not understand the feelings they have. Rather than examine these feelings they simply decide that he is ""pompous"" or ""arrogant"" because they feel he is unapproachable. It makes sense. Here is a man who has everything many would dream of in Hollywood. He has made a popular movie with a huge following and has legions of adoring fans who come to see his movie again and again. His film continues to pack the theater long after it's inital release and has outlived ""the next big thing"" time and again. Blockbuster after blockbuster has come and gone, but The Room stays... I challenge you to find a theater where you can see ""Batman Begins"".. once you have failed in that, come and see The Room.In light of all this I think people feel inferior to Tommy. He has everything they cannot. I urge you all to get past this and see that he is not at all superior. Nor does he think he is better than any of you... that is all in your imagination. Like his character ""Johnny"", Tommy is just like all of us. He is actually very approachable and a wonderful guy.If he seems irritated or short tempered, remember that he has a life just like you. He exists outside of that theater on Saturday nights. He has trials and tribulations like us all. Screening The Room for us all to enjoy is hard work.

624,eggnac,this movie is great,8,2 June 2017,"This movie is diffidently a ""so bad it's good movie"". It would be a lot more reasonable to rate it a 1 because the movie is really bad, but the movie made me laugh so hard my lungs started to hurt and I got extreme hiccups. Some of the quotes from the movie will forever stick in my head, like when Denny tells Lisa ""Can I kiss you?"", it so great when he says it because he smiles as though only innocent & kind people would ask of something like that. But, there are some things in this movie that I think is really bad . One example is Lisa. Her character has no reason to be the way she is. She just does it because the movie needs an antagonist... I guess, it's just so stupid, there should be something that motivates that person to be the way they are. Like why does she lie that Johnny hit her 'cause he got him drunk and is one of the reasons that Johnny kills himself, because she ruined his reputation, also she cheats on his best Mark. Why does she always have to lie about Johnny, he didn't do anything wrong. Her actions are completely unreasonable. But the acting is so bad that it's extremely funny, I would absolutely recommend this movie if you want to watch a movie that is so bad it's good, i would give a solid 8/10",The Room

637,jverschakelen,"Oh hi, IMDb users",1,27 July 2017,"Oh hi, IMDb users.This is not a movie, it is a f*cking travesty. My guess is Tommy Wiseau intended to make an X-rated film but shied away from it at the last minute only to water down the sex scenes (who are about as arousing as the opening credits of The Big Bang Theory, I may add) to an R rating while still sticking to the lousy porn ""storyline"".Indeed, the story (if you can call it that) is essentially about a well-to-do guy called Johnny who at first seems to be loved by everybody. The ""writing"" (it is hard to imagine that any of this was actually thought through and put on paper) already speaks volumes about Tommy Wiseau's own real-life narcissism, but his ""character"" is decomposed completely when his girlfriend Lisa starts cheating on him. None of it makes any sense, and the film itself does nothing but unintentionally expose Wiseau's total inability to deal with life and human emotions. A sh*tload of completely redundant ""scenes"" later - of which only the one where Johnny plays back a recorded conversation between Lisa and her lover could be worthy of a real movie - Johnny kills himself because he feels disrespected by everybody. It is only fitting, then, that the making of this movie itself would be seen as a form of (career) suicide in its own right. One could argue that the so-called cult following of ""The Room"" essentially consists of confused hipsters who have forgotten the difference between genuinely appreciating a form of art because of its aesthetic or intellectual features and ironically enjoying a celebrity publicly break down on Twitter. Indeed, no one in his right mind can pretend to like this thing ""as a movie"": at best, a cynic could experience some form of schadenfreude over its sheer awfulness, wondering why the hell it was ever made (let alone released). Let us hope that James Franco's ""The Disaster Artist"" will somehow help such lost souls re-align their twisted value systems. If this would not prove to be the case, at least Tommy Wiseau can pride himself on having written an appropriate epitaph for his own movie career: ""Here you go, keep the change... Hi doggy!"" - ""You're my favorite customer."" - ""Thanks a lot. Bye!""",The Room

644,krawnin,Misunderstood Masterpiece,9,7 January 2006,"I think its unfortunate that so many people misunderstand this movie. The American Public is so brainwashed by Hollywood that they are afraid when a movie as daring and original as ""The Room"" comes along.Audiences are so used to being spoonfed romantic comedies and cliché love stories that they cannot handle Tommy Wiseau telling it like it is.I'm sure a lot of us have had a ""Lisa"" in our lives. A woman that is both evil and seductive. I recently came from a relationship where I was betrayed much like ""Johnny"" in the film and I can say the anguish and pain is captured perfectly in ""The Room"" People who make fun of the""Lisa you are tearing me a part"" line have obviously never had a love lost. I remember I cried the same way as ""Johnny"" when it happened to me. And to all you macho guys who think that its unmanly when a guy (like Johnny or me) cries because of heartbreak you are full of it. I was captain of my Highschool Football Team and have been with many girls.Speaking of Highschool, I used to date this girl a few times in 10th grade. When I went to college i found out my best friend was seeing her so I know what the relationship between ""Johnny"" and ""Mark"" is like. The strange thing is her name was ""Elizabeth"" and sometimes people called her Lisa when they first met her.The Last thing I want to say is about the symbolism in the movie. It makes me laugh when people get caught up in why ""Johnny"" wears a tuxedo while playing football. Again people have been dumbed down by seeing too many Hollywood Films.People don't understand symbolism anymore. Do you really think ""Johnny"" is wearing a tuxedo because its comfortable? Its a metaphor for the way he feels. The suit represents his approaching marriage and how he lets his friends know that he will not let the confines of that institution prevent him from being just one of the guys. I will let you come up with your own conclusions why it is the psychiatrist that ""falls"".The suit is just one of the many examples of rich symbolism in the movie. The Red Dress symbolizes passion and desire for example.The only reason I'm not giving the movie a perfect 10 is because of the Chris R Scene where Denny is confronted on the roof top about his drug problem. For me it was too intense to be added to the film and i had to leave the theatre for a minute after watching it. It brought up too many painful memories that i wont bring up here.In closing, see the room with an open mind. Let your guard down and abandon what other films have told you your whole life.And remember we all feel trapped and betrayed in our lives but ""There is a door that leads out of every Room"" John N Crawford",The Room

648,jmerali,The Best Film Of The Decade!,10,29 September 2009,"The trailer for 'The Room' claims that it is was best movie of the year. I would argue that The Room is quite possibly the best movie of the decade. Looking back at the big blockbuster hits over this past decade, from the Lord of the Rings to Inglorious Basterds, many of them have left us with a few memorable scenes, and a few memorable quotes to accompany them. But how many films are there where EVERY scene is memorable, and EVERY quote is eagerly anticipated? Grease did it. The Rocky Horror Picture Show did it...and now The Room is doing it. Finally there is a film out there where theater audiences can simultaneously act out , recite lines, and interact with each other...all without having to bring along their mediocre singing voices and goofy costumes.Follow Johnny (Tommy Wiseau) on an emotional journey, where his innocence and blind love is met with betrayal and deception from those who he holds most dear. Meet his unforgettable friends, Mark, Denny, and Peter, along with his future wife, Lisa. Kick back and watch the drama unfold, as Johnny's world begins to turn upside down. If you are thinking to yourself that you've heard this storyline a thousand times over, you're mistaken. Be prepared for a journey unlike any other you've ever experienced.Sadly there are critics out there who contend that this is the worst movie ever made. DO NOT listen to anyone making such ignorant claims, as its simply not true. Let me tell you why. First off, this movie was funded, written, directed, produced, and starring Tommy Wiseau. This much passion and dedication deserves appreciation, in and of itself. Secondly, while it is true that the film encounters some minor subplot holes and scenes that are simply never revisited, one must also acknowledge that such instances have significantly contributed to the film's growing popularity as a fan favorite/cult classic. Finally, this movie is filled with so many unforgettable sequences, quotes, and facial expressions, that even six years after its initial release, it still manages to sell out at the box office time and time again.I have no intention of trying to convince you readers that this movie has the best acting you have ever seen. It doesn't. Nor am I going to tell you that this movie has a fabulous plot or seamless editing. Quite the contrary. But does that make it a bad movie? No! I have seen many movies stacked with great actors and interesting story lines, and they're still awful. Waterworld anyone? The Room is a movie that keeps its viewers completely engaged, constantly laughing, and thoroughly entertained. If that's not a 'good movie', I don't know what is! I encourage everyone reading this review to go out and buy a copy of 'The Room'. Even more, I encourage all of you to gather up all of your friends and buy tickets to the next screening in your area, even if it requires a little bit of driving. This is a theatrical experience that you will be talking about for the rest of your lives. Have you ever been to a movie where you've laughed so hard that you're still crying hours after its over? Have you ever been to a movie where the audience hurls thousands of plastic spoons at the screen...twenty times over? Have you ever been to a movie where the entire crowd has the movie memorized line for line and yells them out in sync? If you have, than sorry for wasting your time. But if you're like me, than you will agree that a movie like this only comes around once in a decade.",The Room
649,rosstigane,Best 'so bad its good' movie out there.,10,25 October 2020,"Is this a good film in the usual sense? No, absolutely not. If one looks at the film in an objective and serious manner, it can be considered a complete and utter trainwreck of a film. However like the trainwreck in the old saying, it becomes 'impossible' to look away from.
The Room differs from most bad movies in that the negativite aspects which plague most bad films (eg. bad acting, bad writing, poor sound mixing, poor editiing), are amplified to such an extreme that, in combination with absolutely no sense of self-awareness and the bizzare, almost mythical/alien presence of the films mastermind, director, producer, writer and main actor - Tommy Wiseau, 'The Room' manages to be so hilariously bad that it transcends into becoming one of the funniest films ever made. Whereas films like 'Sharknado' and 'Birdemic' set out to deliberately emulate the features which have created many 'so bad its good' movies like 'The Room' as well as others like 'Plan 9 from Outer Space' or 'Manos: The Hands of Fate', they ultimately fail in their endeavors and come across as just plain bad, boring and too forced. The key reason for films like 'The Room' being so funny and memorable whilst other imitators fail, concerns the organic, natural and genuine creative process of many of these 'so bad its good' films, primarily in how said filmmakers genuinely tried to make engaging and brilliant films, yet failed so catastrophically - something 'The Disaster Artist' written by Greg Sestero who plays Johnny's best friend Mark, expands upon in great detail. Overall, 'The Room' is a hilarious, absurd, memorable, bizzare and highly-quotable movie which only gets better with repeat viewings and like a Kubrick classic, will likely be studied and analyzed for decades to come by film students, movie critics and film makers (although likely not for the same reasons).TL:DRBest 'so bad its good' film out there.

I would be prepared to take this as an ironic stab at Hollywood if it wasn't for the following points:1. Tommy Wiseau takes himself seriously. (Seriously, he does? Wow.) 2. Nobody (but NOBODY) spends between $7m - $9m of their own money to take the proverbial out of Hollywood. (Pointless tilting at that particular windmill). 3.

Asumming that he is in fact American, you can pretty much judge from first appearances that Wiseau is one of the worst English speakers ever. He doesn't understand the basic concepts of spelling and syntaxes, making him appear like a retarded grown man, or a confused teenager trapped in Ozzy Osbourne's body.Apart from that, reviewing this movie is almost unnecessarily, because there's nothing to debate, there's nothing in this film to be criticized or explained. Anyone with 1% of movie culture can predict from the first 2 minutes that this is one of the poorest intentions of making a decent film. The cast, the crew, the editing, the music, the direction, the landscaping... it's just ridiculous. It doesn't make any sense at all, and that's why it's a funny and distracting film.
